 Elder W. W Woodruff  Thanked God that he had lived to seea Presbyterian Meeting House filled with the Latter Day Saintsand the Pulpit occupied with the Apostles of the Lamb.  The Mothersof Israel are to bear a royal people.  Instructed the little boys toseek truth and rigtheousnes. They are to bear off this Kingdom 
 Elder W. Woodruff Remarked that weare in a great school, the principals ofwhich are numerous & importantWe should prize our liberty, our priviledges,the gospel of life and salvation, the holypriesthood, the living oracles, thewritten word, and the promise ofeternal life. We should labor to buildup the Kingdom of God,  to overcomethe world, the flesh and the DevilThe more of the spirit of God a personhas the more they are like Him.We are under obligations before theLord to live so as to possess enoughof the Holy spirit to keep his com-mandments and the counsels givento us by His servants 
 Elder Wilford Woodruff Has always re-joiced in the Gospel. Spoke of his earlyconversion to the truth of the Latter day work.Was Baptized immediately after hearing it.Encouraged the saints with a lengthy and vigorous appeal, to live honestly and truthfullywith each other and their God, that they may enjoy life Eternal. 
 Elder W. W Woodruff.  We as as people occupy a po-sition now that we are acknowledged by all mento be a living fact.  We are in Zion, and are learningits praticle workings.  The Prophets of old saw itin its purity and glory, but the mnutia of build-ing it up is to be revealed day by day, as circumstances develop themselves.  We have the promise thatthis Zion will never be thrown down.  We are the onlypeople upon the earth who are preparing for the com-ing of the Son of Man.  There is not a place we havededicated to God, but what is held sacred unto God.And we shall have to rebuild the waste places.  God hasa willing people and although we have labored thirtyeight years, Zion is not built up to attract the gazeand admiration of the nations.  The word of wisdom isnow a commandment with ^for^  us to keep.  Spoke of the greatnumber of evil spirits that are in existence: probablyseventy to each person on the earth.  Without revelationwe could not do any thing as Latter Day Saints.  The futureis glorious, if we are obedient, to the counsels of Godsservants upon the earth. 
 Elder W. W. Woodruff. We have covenanted to serveGod, Keep his commandments, and proclaim his gospel to the children of men. Much is crowded intothis generation dispensation, more is required of usthan any other. The Elders of to day have traveled a thousandmiles to where the Elders of Jesus traveled one. Many of the Apostals who laid the foundation of this church, have passed away. Bro H. C Kimball's testimony is now in forcewith us. He was a great Prophet a man of integrity:is now resting in peace. We know but little aboutthe laws in the spirit world, whether the spirits arearound about us or not. We do not prize our bless-ings our Prophets until they are gone. Refered to thesuccess of the Missionaries in the southern States. Thosewho keep the Celestial Law will recive a celestial sal-vation. We do not live up to the Revelations we havenow received. Bro Heber is now visiting with JosephHyrum and the other faithful one who have gone before.Those who apostatize will go down to hell,and be angels to the Devil, and will regret in throughout all Eternity. Let us live our religion. 
 Elder W Woodruff related some of this ex-prience when the spirit of God alone sustained and di-rected him. There never was a time when the saintsneeded more of the spirit of the lord than at thepresent. The work of the saints is to pepare aplace where Jesus can come and preside. Afterlaboring for thirty years will we sell our birth rightfor a few goods? The Lord has kept His covenantwith us and has come out of His hiding place.The nations are vexed by his fury. Many of the Elders and High Priests of thirty years standing willsustain the wicked in our midst. The spiritsays let them alone from this hour. 
 Elder W Woodruff. The two spirits had a war-fare with the Prophet Joseph. The Devil tempted him to obtain the plates for riches. The lives of all the prophets and Apostles should give us joy. Delighted to see the thousands of children during the recent mission to Sanpete. There is a great work before them Desires that the saints will live their religion, and be prepared for the coming of the Son of Man. 
 Elder Wilford Woodruff. This is the greatestday and generation that has ever been. Preach-ing the gGospel, rebuilding of Jerusalem andthe coming of the Son of God. It required a vast amount of faith in God, for the Elders to go forthwithout purse or script, and establish the Gospel.But the Latter Day Saints are a peculiar people.We do live in a fast age, Gods and Men and Devils. Every thing in Heaven, on Earth and in Hellare in a hurry. Brigham Young is the Lordsmouth piece to this people. He is labouring to build up Zion, agreeable to the decrees of theAlmighty. 
 Apostle Wilford Woodruff, unless we have the spiritof God our Religion is a farce, in all ages of the world the devilhas harted the saints. It is a shame indeed that men in as greatpossitions as Vice President and Legislators of this land shouldseek to destroy the saints. We are all in the hands of God andare perscecuted for our relegion, this is a wicked and lyinggeneration, the most of all other that have been on the faceof the earth. 50 years ago a murder was almost unknownMay we perform the work before us in a manner, acceptableto God and all the Holy men that have gone before. 
 Elder W. Woodruff. There are but two churches upon the earth, the church of God, and the church of the Devil.  we have everything on our side to make us rejoice, God the Hosts of heaven and the good and great Saints who have passed before.  The dead are visiting the living to stir them up to perform the necessary duties for the dead. This nation are getting ripe for the wrath of God for he prom-ised the wrath of God  the brother of Jared that none shouldmaintain it unless they served him, they have had a little rebellion  warni[n]g in the recent rebellion and are to day divi-ded and the most corrupt of all people that ever lived upon the earth. Cooperation should have been adopted 20 years ago, to keep the devil from us. 
 Page 1 from page 34 [of "An explanation of the Masonic Plate; showing the emblems of each degree from the entered apprentice to the Royal Arch or Five Orders of Masonry" by John Harris published in Bristol, England in 1839.]Shall here add a little further on MasonryKing Solomon's officers appointed before he commandedthe work of the Temple. [##1 Kings 4:7-19##]King Solomon appointed Deputy Grand Masterthe Illustrious Tito prince Harodin, Senior Grandwarden; And the Noble prince Adoniram, Juniorgrand warden [##1 Kings 4:1-6##]; the number of them employed, aranged, and classed in every Department of this work was asfollows, The first, Harodin princes, Rulers or Provoststhree Hundred; Secondly, Mon Atzchism or overseers,as the fifteen and comforters of the people in workingthese were expert workmen & named by King Solomonmasters meaning mMasters over the workman tothe number of 3,300; thirdly Ghiblim, named StoneSquarers, polishers and Sculptors, Hewers, Setters,Layers & Builders, [##1 King 5##] those these were expert Fellowcrafts80,000 the number of ^Free^ Masons employed in the work ofthe temple, exclusive of the Two Grand Masters Wardens;113,600, the men of burdens 70,000 not numbered asMasons; in the quarries were 750 lod[g]es, each containingone master, two wardens, & eleven times seven brethren,which amount to 6,000 men; in the forest of Lebanon were420 lodges, with the same number in each which 
 make 33,600; the levy out of Israel had always20,000, at rest, and these sums make together 113,600,The exact number employed at the work of thetemple, exclusive of the Ishsabbal, who were litterallyslaves to the workmen. It was 480 years afterthe delivery of the children of Israel from their Egptianbondage [##Exodus 15##], that Solomon laid the foundations stoneat the north east angle of the Temple on Mount Moriah [##2 Chronicles 3:1##]one of the three hills of Jerusalem; they were employedthree years in preparing the materials for thebuilding for the Earth was raised 400 cubits, beingsix hundred feet, in order to form it on a levelwith the surface of the rock on which the building wasraised. Every [thing] being prepared, King Solomon, on the Fourth year of his Reign and on the Second Day of theMonth, laid the Foundation Stone, according tothe plan given by David his father upon the arkof alliance; every energy was used to render it a perfectspecimen of art; every stone, every piece of timber wascarved marked & numbered in the Quarry & ^in the^ forest& nothing remained for the workmen at Jerusalembut to join the materials with precission, on a refferenceto the marks & numbers given by the workmen 
 and this was effected without the use of ax, hammers,or mettal tool, so that nothing was heard at Zions saveharmony & peace; theres appears to have been a curiousidea of pollution in the use of any iron tools leveledabout the Tabernacle, or holy structure (by the Masons)as it seemed this command was given to Mosesby the Almighty on Mount Sinai [##Exodus 20##], respectingthe construction of the Tabernacle, that no toolsof Iron to be used, giving in the stronged terms asconveying pollutions, but gold, silvers & wood; brasswork at a distance, for the sound was not to be heard atthe Tabernacle. The Temple of Solomon was ownlya small building, & very inferior in point of sizeto some of our Churches, its dimensions beingownly 150 feet long and 135 feet broad, but its splendor& superiority lay in the richness of its materials, itwas built of white marble so excellently put togetherthat even the joints could not be distinguished, & lookedas one entire stone, the timber was of ceder & olive woodcovered with plates of gold & even studded with preciousjewels; the expense of the building & ornaments of thisTemple, it is said by Villopandus, amounted to £904,322,500, sterling 
 The value of the gold vessels alone was £545,296,206, sterlingand the silver was £439,344,000; added to this the wages,provission, and other necessaries for 100,000 workmenand 70,000 slaves for upwards of seven years! Besides300 grand officers on masters and 3,300 overseers in whomin addition to their wages, King Solomon presented as afree gift £6,763,977, Henoditus informs us the yearlytreasures imported from Ophir was £3,240,000 sterlingall of our money; his annual tribute from dependantnations, was £4,796,200 sterling. Solomon hadships & sailed them to Ophir and Tarshish for gold, Silver& precious stones, which was the most valuable partof his revenue; he visited those places in person & withhis usual wisdom superintended not ownly thecollages of naval architecture established there but also the tithing out of his own ships for the improvementof this important branch of traffic, which [mattered this]to beautify the Temple with such splendour, to theservice of God A talent of Gold is £5,476 sterling5/27375

Noah sentout a raven that never returned afterwards, then he sent outthe dove that he might ascertain whether the waters had subsidedthis Bird very soon returned to the Ark, unable from theprevalence of the waters to find a place of rest, at the end ofseven days he sent forth a dove a second time, which returned tothe Ark with an olive leaf in her mouth, as a token of peace &reconciliation with God, ##Genesis 8## & the olive branch has been adopted

Here is a land representedas stretched down from a cloud, as if grasping a man of theearth—this is the translation of Enoch after living in thefear of God on Earth three hundred & sixty & five years the god took him without seeing death, or even enteringthe grave. ##Genesis 5:22-24##5. The representation of King Solomon or his Throne, & the Queen of Sheba presenting him with gifts & an asshe came from a far distant country to seek his wisdom& prove his—.##1 King 10:1-10##5 The Sword & Septre worn byKing Solomon, at the time he sat on the judgment seat.5. A Single Triangle, bearing the secret name of Gal—that was given to the Israelites on Jews, on Mount Horeb,on entering Enoch's subteranean Temple on MountMoriah, Horeb or Sinai, that ever R. A. M. out to bemade accquanted with, or otherwise they must be inthe dark5. The representation of the Equilateral triangle,with H. I: in the centre, signifies Holy Temple, on this Templeshall be Holyi. This triangle was cast in gold; it wasdiscovered on Mount Moriah, by the workman underminingthe rock, 10 lay the foundation for the Temple of Solomon;it was discovered six feet from the surfice of the rock, & by thisEquilateral triangle it led to the grand Subteranean Temple 
 built by the three Grand Masters before the flood; where wasdiscovered many things, represented on this Masonic plate,with the three Grand Master's names, which can be foundin scripture; ##Exodus 32## (by those who know it) it was discovered in theyear of the world 2939, and 480, years after the children of Israelcame out of Egypt, &c A further illusion to the rod—the transformation of Moses's rod into a serpent hadreference to events of the [opeabrt] importance to man, as ourfirst parents were beguiled by the devil, in the form of a serpentso that miraculous rod, which had its origins in the Gardenof Eden & is supposed by the Jewish Rabbis, to have been oneof the ten things created. on the evening of the firstSabbath & was changed into a serpent as a sign, toconfirm the promise of Delivering a select [portion] oftheir restraints from Egyptian Bondage. This rod alsorefered to the mighty work about to be accomplished inEgypt; for as the rod of Mosess government was fearfulas the attack of a serpent to the Egyptians, so it was ascepter of righteousness to the children of Israel. It wascalled the rod of God, & used by Aaron in Egypt & Mosesin the wilderness. It was a sign of the Divine Author-ity, & a visible demonstration of Gods power;used to confound the pretended skill of the Magicianstheis show the Omnipitence of the Deity, & to humble thepride of Pharaoh when he beheld the mighty wonders wroughtby so apparently contemptible [on agent] as a Shephard's Staff, 
 but above all, this rod metamorphized, was a type ofChrist's death, to which indeed all Masonry, ultimately points;as by a serpent, Death came into the world—so by thedeath of the Son of God, the serpent or Satan, was fullyvanquished & trodden under foot.5. Moses lifting upthe serpent.—Thus Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilder-ness, that as many as looked on it, might be healed ofthe wounds, inflicted by firery serpents, for their disobedientmurmurings, ##Numbers 21:5-9## & the death of Christ h upon the cross thustypiphied, was to deliver us from sin & Death, & to give afull satisfaction & attonement for the sins of all mankind;Moses took posselnig of  possession of this rod in the landof Midian, & after Jetho had explained all the [posturetay] [posterity]relatives to its movemention from the time of Adam, & it was directed by the Almighty to be used as theapparent agent of all his miracles. it was changed intoa serpent three different times, first at Horeb ##Exodus 4:2-5## againin the land of Goshan before the congregation of the Elders,& lastly in the Court of Pharaoh. ##Exodus 7:8-13## To give Moses afurther assurance of his power & protection, God commandedhim to put his hand into his bosom, which by that simple act, contracted a supernatural leprosy;he repeated the second time, but soon became sound& healthy as the other; ##Exodus 4:6-9## next a small quantity 
 of water was changed into Blood at the word of God; ##Exodus 7:17-25##the the asstonishment of Moses was somewhat alleged,& his faith confirmed, by the assumer that he shouldperform the same, & operates miracels in the land ofEgypt to induce pharaoh to set his captive Bretherat liberty; as a concluding confirmation of hismission, Moses required to move in whose [many]he was to demand the do liberation of the Israelites,and the Almighty [consderached] to reveal to him thatawful name which made the pillars of the East tremble,this tremendious word is—or—or—a constructionof —a tremendious context ensued between Moses asthe agent of the true God, & the Magicans as the agents ofthe Egyptian Gods, Moses arrived with that powerful rodwhat Adam was permitted to take from the tree ofknowledge, & which was the acknowledged testimonyof his [Diven cominussion] [Diveine Commission], wrote in the presence of pharaoh & his court at [Taris]; an extraordinary [minute]as a proof that his appeal to the gGod of Israel was not to be slited slited ^slighted^ with impurity; this rod was[eust] by Aaron upon the ground & it immediately becamea serpent, twingi twining itself in folds to the combinationof the whole cCourt, Amenophis called for Jannes & Jambres ##2 Timothy 3:##his magicians, role under took to perform the same miraclebut the serpent of Moses displayed his superiority, by devouring the serpents of the Magicians &c. 
 And fourteen hundred sixty four millions & four hundred &eighty thousand Roman Crowns of Likes which at five shillingsthe silver crown & six shillings the gold crown, amount tonine hundred & eleven millions, four hundred & sixteenthousand two hundred & seven p9ounds four shillings sterling.To this we add Solomons annual revenue, whichwas one million of crowns his tracking to Ophir forgold, & the presents made him by all the castle asmentioned, so that he exceeded all the kings of the worldfor riches; we are not to wonder at his being able to carryon this expensive Temple & that it surpassed all the structures ofthe world for magnificence & contrivance since it wasbuilt by the direction of Heaven. The glorious Templewas for the sins of the world people Destroyed by Nebuchadnezzarat the reign of Zedekiah in the year of the world 3515 and 588years before Christ. ##2 Kings 25:8-9## The second Temple was rebuilt at at theand of 70 years when the Jews returned from the Babylonianscaptivity; but the workman were oblieged to keep swords by themto repeal the samaritans, who watched all opportunities of obstructing them in the work. ##Ezra 4:1-7## The second Temple fell for shortof the glory & magnificence of the former built by King Solomonboth as the structure & ornaments; neither had it the rot ofmanna, the rod of Aaron, the Ark of the Covenant withtwo tables of the same, nor the fire of sacrafice, which wereordered to be kept perpetually in the Holy of Holies or SanctionSanctorires, as a memorail forever. Fourth I mustadd is recorded in ##1 Chronicles 22:6-16|Scriptires## that when King Davidwas giving his advise to his son Solomon; he exhorts himto build a house for the Lord, & to show how much he 
 said it at least: tells him that he had out of his [property]laid up for purpose, one hundred thousand talents ofsilver gold & a thousand thousand talents of silver vesselsbrass & iron without wait, & he tills him that over & abovewhat he had mentioned before he had provided three thousandtalents of fine gold, & seven thousand talents of silver to overlaythe walls of the house, besides all this his princes & agentmen made a free gift of five thousand talents of gold, &ten thousand talents of silver towards the building. Now allthese sums added to gether make up108.00 talents of gold at £5075-15-7 is £548,244,1501,017,000 talents of silver at £353=11=10 is £ 359,602,725Total expens of the Building — * £ 907=846,875 In this glorious undertaking nothing was [smithed] [which] art& [genious] aided by wealth & industry could supply; the twisted& highly earned work of the Parian marble columns the plantingsof embossed gold; blazing strung with diamonds & other preciousstones; the gorgeous & magnifficent sculptures, all contributedin rich union to display the wisdom of Solomon inhis appropriation of this grand Masonic pile, to the [sread]purpose of Gods worship; the strength of King Hiram, forhis abundant supplies of materials & men & the [lennth]of the ingenious—, who with a capacity more than Mortalman exercised his shinning abilities to their utmost stretchin Devising & executing such a perfect model of art. Beforethe consecration of the Temple it was visited by HiramKing of Tyre who was a complete master of the science ##1 King 7:13## 
 of operative masonry, & after fully viewing all its parts, he pronouncedit to be the highest effort of human genius, in which herenounced his claim to pre-eminence on this noble scienceof Grand Master of all masons. [##1 Kings 7:13-37##] The fame of his grand edificesoon prompted the inquisitive of all Nations to travel &spend some time at Jerusalem, & survey its exccellencies,as far as was allowed to the gentiles, & they soon found thatthe joint skills of all the world came infinitely short ofthe Israelites in the wisdom, strength & beauty of their architecture. when the wise King Solomon was Grand Mastersof all Masons at Jerusalem, when the learned King Hiramwas Grand Master at Tyre & the inspired—had beenmaster of the work; when true masonry was under thecare & direction of heaven & when the noble & wisethought it an known to be associates of the ingeniouscraftsman in them well fenced lodges; according to theTemple of—became the just wonder of alltravelers on Earth. The pillars differ even in scripturein regard to the size; they were nobly adorned with [chapiters]&c, &c, and surmounted by two spherical Balls whichrepresented the two globes of the Earth & Heavens & pointedout Masonry universal. [##1 Kings 7:40-41##] They were thus placedby the expert by the direction of King Solomon in refferenceto the remarkable pillar of a cloud & of fire whichproved a light & guide to the Israelites in their miraculous 
 escape from Egyptian Bondage, & covered with darknessto the Egyptians, proved their destruction in the red sea.King Solomon fearing the obduracy of his subjects mightof some future time cause them to forget the circumstances attending that remarkable deliverance; placed the pillars thussurmounted to this elevation situation, as a publicmonument to remind the Jews when they entered or leftthe Temple of the mercy of God to their nations; [##1 Kings 7:40-51##] in that greatevent, these two pillars were of such vital importance to thesupporter of the Temple, that its destructions by Nebuchadnezzer,the Lord, standing upon the alter, commanded the destroy-ing Angel to strike the chapiters, or teach of the pillarthat ruin might ensue, not even of the pillar & porchor the Temple itself on even all Jerusalem, but also ofthe whole Jewish nations or polity; hence as the creationof these pillars is seconded in scripture, as an eminentproof of the magnitude & splendtion splendour of allsolomons empire, as well as the wisdom strength & learnthof the three united Grand, Masters, so was their destructiontypical of the ruin of the Jewish state which recieved atemporary annihilation of seventy years, when this Temple was destroyed, as predicted by Jeremiah & other prophets,for their sins in neglecting to keep holy the sabbatical yearsaccording to the commandments of the Lord. [##2 Kings 25:8-17##] The priest inthe Temple perform every holy office of their religioun withtheir feet uncovered. It is not any where commandedthat the priests should officiate Barefoot but among thegarments assigned for the priests shoes not being named 
 Sacramento Mar 13th 1853Bro WoodruffAfter a long silence I wish to write you a few lines as I am sure you are always anxious to know what is going on in the world to describe matters in california I shall not attempt to do in full but shall ask why is it I am a witness always among the ungodly not however by way of complaining for that is not my feeling but on the contrary I Rejoice that I am permited to sail amidstall kinds of Strange scenes and why it throws back the curtain that hangs over Babilon and enables me to know the ways of Men and the dealings of God among the people and I feel like a Watchman on the Picket Post and if I should give way to my feelings Ishould almost shout good and gloriously but there is one thing left to keep me humble and that is hard work but prehaps I shall soon work out the debt and have a chance to rest but if not I must try to bear my fate in patience and not complain truly the scenes I am called to witness are 
 unaccountable Yet nesessary I am now endeavouring to locate my family as none of her numerous friends here have as yet done but as far as the scum of this wise and Gene Gor Generation is concerned they are willing Provided however, my family will deny any frendship for me & it will be as the Devil saw to ^the^ Saviour the Kingdoms of the world and the glory of them all are Yours but I am well persuaded that all the Riches of this world that I am blest with will come from a more reliable source and by untiring dilligence continualy to me the things arround me are quite inter-esting but would not be did I not some times get a peep through the Mist of Dark-ness so as to comprehend the whys andwherfores this is not my home only as it must be yet I feel well I think I have written to you once since I arrived if not I will say the Elders all arrived safe and Received their outfits through the liberately of bro Horner and others but as for me I do not Recon myself popular among the Calefornia saints and Bro Sparks told me they wanted some smart man sent on like Jedediah Grant and there would be buisness for him all the time 
 But as the night is fast coming on I must close this harried Sheet wishing to Be Rememberd to Bro Benson & Geo A Smith to whom I intend to write as soon as I can with this mail I send you Several papers one is the HeraldYours in the bonds of the new Covenant forever Alexander BadlamP.

 Sacramento July 27 1853Dear Bro WoodruffFeeling as I do that my labour is not lost while I take all pains to write you all the news of the day because of the confidence I have in your punc-tuality and kind attention in the full and generous ^fulfilment^ of all your promices and if in this respect my duties are as faithfuly performed it is all I expect to do. I am happy to tell you I feel that my mission in california has quite as nearly commenced it is well for us that the God of Heaven governes all things to bring about his own pur-poses and uses his own instruments to bring about his own work among men on the earth And I rejoice in it and pray that he may use me as seemeth good in his sight And I shall therfore direct all my energies to the upbuilding of the Kingdom of the Most High I have as yet kept free from the entanglements of Babilon I am confident our grand enemy the Devil who has always en-deavoured to check the movments of the servants of god has not been idle while I have been strugling to lay the foundation of a good work,it is not the gold of California I seek as the danties (so called) but a home with my brethren on earth and a full Salvation with the sanctified of allNations and ages Past Present & to Come 
 and I ask no more In reply to your kind and interesting letter I am glad you are appointed on the temple for I know your diligence and this reminds me of the dream you related about the hurry of labour the making of garments & by the Saints who were preparing for the coming of the Son of Man Yet I must say itseems strange to me that so much toil & care falls to the lot of a few and can only conclude the kingdom will be thiers of course it will belong to those who build it. (all Right) Many will find when it too late our Honoured and Heaven endued Apostles & Prop-hets worn out will be known on earth to only as imortal for thier names must live forever May the blessings of Heav-en ever be with them and it is my prayer that all the Saints May be blessed with a glorious harvest that the templemay go on the prospect to me looks good how vast the difference in the numbers of murders in the City of Salt Lake and Sacramento and at San Francisco when the dignity of man is insulted he resorts to arms and he thinks so much of his honour he is willing to sell his rum soaked body to keep that he has not got for if he had true honour he would preserve his own body and spare the life of another Yet duel fighters are the things (not Men) whom the PEOPLE CHOOSE to govern the affairs of State thus Endorsing all thies wicked acts 
 Yet after all we have reason to be glad for a california it is an exelent plaster and the only one I know off strong enough to draw off the scum from the big Salt Lake Basin a portion of golddust is more powerful than Spanish Flies and for the information of those who are nearly GORNE of california fever I would recomend a BATH in some of the pure streams of Utah a little good advice from the Governour and a good situation on the public works before they pull up STAKES to go to a land of which they know but little of but some may say if Bro Badlam can go to california to get Rich why not me I will say wait till you see him Rich and you will get a portion of it as to his family he did not go to california with the expectation of taking them back to the valley but heHE will come when the same calls that sent him awayI know not that I have a bitter enemy in california but expect to enjoy the reputation I live for Mormonism as it is ^is^ Honourable and evry man who honours his calling as a Saint will be respected when he is known it is ignorance in a great degree that troubles many I stop my pen to speak with one of our Ships Company of 1849who tells me I have the good feelings of that company because of the intrest I had for thier welfare if so I am glad and hope to do good to all men wherever i go that none may have occations to complain I find it best to let all things Roll as in thier time and placesEver holding sacred the principles of the gospel and the name of God as Ever I Remain your friend & Brother Alexr Badlam 
 after addings a few items I shall close for the present as it ^is^ Possible that Sister Cobb dont know where Isaac her Nephew is I will say he started ahead of the Elders in January to Sydey in A^us^stralia I wanted him to Remain with Me But he would not I have not heard fromhim he wished me to Remember him to bro Benson which I do through you.A Man whose name is Peter Spencer whose wife is a sister to Ellen Condor wife of Edward Condor all from England is here and wishes to be remembered to the family & also to the Mother whose name is PearcePlease say to Father John Smith I Remember him and shall write also to Bro Geo A Smith And Bro Benson whom I do not forgetPlease Remember me to all [engaring] frindsFarwell Alexr BadlamLook out for papers[sideways text] A.

 Sacramento City Aug. 28th, 52Brother WilfordI wrote you a few days since in which I stated that those Bonds paid me by Col. Reese were worth only 7c cts. in the dollar and he gave me them at 8c cts. in the dollar. He wished me to keep them as long as I could which I have done as he supposed they would advance, and should they bring even 8c cts. per dollar I was to pay him back the amount and if they sold for any less than that he would make it up. They are now worth only 65 cts. and ^still at that^ I shall be obliged to sell them immediately as I take the steamer for N. Yuk on the 1st Sept. the amount he paid me in then was $1100 - the discount in that amount between 8 c ch. and 65 would be 165$ which I presume will be what I shall get for themThat amount $165 Mr. Reese must pay you so that it can be forwarded this fall.  should that amount not be right either way we will correct it.  The mail for Salt Lake some days so that I cannot be more definiteon the subject.  I shall hold them as directed by Col. Reese till the last moment which will be the 31st, inst I am sorry and feel quite disappointed that that matter is not closed up and hope it will be attended to immediately, that there will be no more delay on the part of Mr. Reese at the valley.Nothing new of interest with me.  please write me by next mail to the [Suters] saying how emegration is coming in.  The long letter of this mail to this placeI did not receive from you.

Col. Reese was not at homehad gone to San Francisco. I am waiting here to see him on hisreturn, expecting him daily. California presents a dull anddismal appearance, this is the dullest season of the year inconsequence of the scarcity of water, many men are out of employment and cannot make one half enough to pay their board.As soon as I see the Col, I shall go to Sacramento City andsee what is to be done there, should I not be able to findsome favorable business will take the steamer by and by for N. YorkOur journey from Salt Lake was rather hard, however wegot along well, the last 400 miles are tough down theHumbolt and over the mountains. How very, very much Iwant to visit Salt Lake. I feel quite dissatisfied inleaving so soon. I feel much more interest in it now thanformerly, it appears to me that I hardly saw you at all evenafter going so long a distance for almost exclusively thatexpress business. Was it not for the great fatigue of the journeyacross the plains I would return that way but I possess hardly[usual] [cemaye] enough to undertake an other such trip.I was glad to hear that Dr. B. had paid that dept. Iwas not uneasy about it as it had Brother [Tamgs] name on itthat will be quite a help toward my settling my old affairs 
 [sideways text] I F Carter [end of sideways text]and a settlement of them is something. God knows that I greatlydesire. I am like a broken stick, of no account can do nothingno I desire. I feel it most deeply, and really hope thatsomething may turn up whereby I may extricate myselfI do not desire great wealth, that is not my object, societyfriends and relatives I prize much higher, with a privilege ofliving just as we shall wish we had when we came to die.This has been my wish and determination for years past to do as nearwhat is right as possible, to do unto others just as I would haveanother do unto me, but we will do w[r]ong sometimes particularlywhen we are not under the influence of a higher power.I feel very thankful that I spent the last night as I did inSalt Lake, the influence is very great on me, many views of thechurch coincide with my aim, that is, all with which I am familiar, some I know nothing of, which I shall leave with time todetermine. We have had the advantages of a pious education,a pious Mother whose prayers have been long and frequent and fervent for our future happiness and hope we shall fullyappreciate them. I have been Providentially spared. I feel that I have not deserved such loving kindness from the hands of a Supreme Beingbut the mind is tempered to the slian lamb and I am I hope trulythankful for his recollections of my wants and circumstancesOn my way from this place to Sacramento I shall go bySalmon falls and try to find Calvin, hope he has been successfulI should like much to meet with something by which I couldmake a few thousand, this winter will be as favorable a timeas any I think to settle my old business should you be able tocollect something in those accounts and forward let us much aspossible be in American and foreign coin is the best I can do withvalley coin is 20 pr. ct. discount and many refuse it at thatthere is a man in N. York formerly from Baltimore that is owingme an important amount, was unfortunate in business, shouldI chance to get that I should be all right, hope sucha thing may phappen presume you see my letter from theplains by Brown.

 BLESSINGS ENJOYED BY THE SAINTS.Remarks by Elder WILFORD WOORDRUFF, made in the Tabernacle, Grea[t]Salt Lake City, May 12, 1861.REPORTED BY J. V. LONG.Brethren and sisters, after thecongregation receiving so much in-structions, I feel that I shall makemy remarks very brief. It is truly good to sit and hear the word of theLord, and it is truly a good thing tobelieve in it; but it is still better topractise it.I have reflected to-day, as I fre-quently do, with regard to the mercyof God and his loving-kindness to thechildren of men. The positions thatthe children of men occupy withregard to the difference there is inthe minds of men on the subject ofreligion and the character of God is 
 an important one. I have consideredthe responsibility that rests upon menin regard to these things. Thereseems to be very few that really havefaith in the Lord God of our fathers.If we judge them by their works, wemust certainly come to this conclu-sion. It is certainly a great blessingto this people that they have faith inGod and in the promises of our Heavenly Father.Truth is one of the attributes ofthe Almighty, and what he promiseshe will fulfil. Now, if the childrenof men believed this, they could savethemselves a great deal of trouble.If those who embrace the Gospelcould have confidence to abide in thetruth, they would escape many tryingscenes through which the wicked willhave to pass. The trouble that awaitsthis nation, and that other nationshave had to pass through in variousages that are past, has been becausethey have had no confidence in the Lord. They have not obeyed him,but have turned from him—rejectedthe counsel given to them. It willbe precisely so with this nation whentheir afflictions begin to come uponthem, for the Lord will be avenged.We can now see the words of theLord and his Prophets fulfillingbefore our eyes.This is a peculiar generation—asingular time in which we live.There seems to be a great deal of theword of the Lord fulfilling in our dayand age of the world. We professto acknowledge the hand of the Lordin what we see around us, and I trustwe do it in our hearts. We haveread, many years ago, the promisecontained in the Book of Doctrineand Covenants concerning the nationin which we live. The Lord said, inthe early rise of this Church, inspeaking of this land, that we shouldhear of wars abroad; but at the sametime we should not know the heartsof the children of men in our owncountry. And the commandmentwas to his people to prepare them-selves to stand in holy places whenthe indignation of the Almightyshould be passing over the earth.We now see these things coming topass. They are plain and clear beforeour eyes. We have a part fulfilled;and as truth is one of the attributesof the Almighty, everything that hesays he will fulfil. The promise is tothe whole world—"He that believethand is baptized shall be saved, and hethat believeth not shall be damned."This promise is sure; and if the Lordfulfils in one instance, he will inanother. He will save the people ifthey will obey him; and if they do not he will not save them, but they will have to reap the reward that isdue them for their works.I consider that it is a blessing that I have the opportunity of believingin the Gospel and in the word of theLord. I believe in them, and rejoiceto know that they are true, and thatthey will be fulfilled. I bear mytestimony to the truth of this Gospel.I also testify that Joseph Smith wasa Prophet of the Lord. I know this as well as I do that I exist. I knowby inspiration and by the revelationsof Jesus Christ and the manifesta-tions of the Spirit of God from yearto year and from time to time. Ilikewise see around me the fulfilmentof prophecy, and this tends tostrengthen me, and also every Latter-day Saint. The Scriptures tell usthat there is a spirit in man, and thatthe inspiration of the Almightygiveth it understanding. It is uponthis principle that we become ac-quainted with the truth, and thepower of the Gospel which we havereceived. The principles of eternallife are manifested unto us by the in-spiration of the Holy Ghost; for thatSpirit rests upon us—it influences ourminds; and if we watch those teachings,having within us the right feeling, 
 we shall comprehend things clearlyas they are. We can see the Lordspeaking to the nations and vexing them in his hot displeasure, and stillmany eat, drink, and are satisfied,and do not appear to be as energeticand active as they might be. It isour duty to be alive and wide-awaketo the times, for the things that aretranspiring are joyful, because in themwe see the accomplishment and fulfil-ment of the predictions of the Pro-phets of God that have lived in thisgeneration. The things we are ex-periencing now are attended withsalvation, and are preparing us tomagnify our callings and fulfillingthe object of our creation upon theearth.I always rejoice in seeing myfellow-men come to a knowledge ofthe truth by obedience to the Gospelas taught by the servants of the Lord.When men have gone forth in thewaters of baptism, and received the laying on of hands for the gift of theHoly Ghost, they receive the sametruth, the same light as we have re-ceived; and thus we become of oneheart and one mind, and follow outthe inspiration of the Holy Ghostwhich attend his Gospel. In preach-ing the Gospel and administering theordinances of the Lord's house, theSpirit of inspiration of heaven ac-companies those who officiate, that itwill remain ever with them, if faith-ful, in all the duties of life.When I hear the brethren speak ofthe dealings of God with the presentgeneration, I perceive that their mindsall run together. The record whichthey bear is one; they all agree intheir testimony; they are one instating that the work of the Lord ourGod will prevail over all its enemies.But it is a calamity, as we look at itnaturally, for the generation in whichwe live, that the Gospel is preachedand by them rejected; in consequenceof which the Spirit is taken fromthem, because they follow the devicesof their own hearts and their wickedimaginations. They follow the de-vices of the Evil One, and they spreadit broadcast, as it were, the crosswhich brings death and destruction,which brings sorrow and mourning;and this is the case with many in the present day and age of the world.There is not a man to-day that hasthe Spirit of the Lord, and that isfaithful in his calling, but what cansee the state of things both in andout of the Church. He can see themwith his eyes, and hear them with hisears, and they can see the hand ofGod thrown over his people to-day.I rejoice in the blessings that theLord gives, and I feel that we oughtto be faithful. If there are anybodywho are blessed of the Lord, it is theLatter-day Saints; and if there areanybody upon the earth who are andshould be willing to obey counsel, itis the Saints of the living God. Wehave reaped the benefit of it for years,and we know that it brings forth joy,peace, and consolation to the souls ofmen; and we would certainly be veryfoolish to turn away from the onlysource that will bring us joy, salva-tion, and eternal life. To do this,we should have to turn our backsupon the only friends we have, andshut up the only source from whichwe draw the blessings we have inthis life.The world really do not knowwhat they are doing; they don't comprehend what lies before them;they jndge after the hearing of theear, and while calamities will over-take the wicked, as the Lord hasspoken, we have something to holdon to and to rely upon. We haveseen the hand dealings of theAlmighty with us; we have learnedhis promises. Has he broken hispromises to his people? He has not;He has been faithful and true. I firmly believe that we shall partake 
 of all the blessings of the kingdomof God by obeying the counsel ofthose set over us, for I know thatGod has established a governmentto control, to guide, and to dictate;and we shall not find so perfect agovernment as this in any part of theearth, for it is the government ofheaven.I desire that we may have powerand a disposition to live faithful to-day, to do right, to obey counsel,that whatever we are told to do wemay unite together and do with allour hearts. If there is strength any-where, it is here. If it does not existhere, it does not exist anywhere.There is no spirit of friendship inthe world; it has taken the wings ofthe morning and flown away frommany of the nations, and the blessingsof the Lord are being withdrawn ina great measure from the nations of the earth. The people have no dis-position to obey that which is right,or give the servants of God an op-portunity of preaching the truth forthe salvation of fallen man. Thosewho despise those blessings and pri-vileges will find that the consequencesand reward will follow.I feel thankful that we are here inthe valleys of the mountains; and Irejoice that we are at peace, and notobliged to fortify Great Salt LakeCity, as the people are obliged to doin Washington; nor is our Presidentcompelled to flee to Canada to savehis life. We are safe and in quietude.The enemies of this kingdom do notunderstand the spirit and power ofthe Gospel. It is a spirit and apower that they cannot cope with,and it is so with all the sectarianworld. We have the privilege oflying down and of rising up in peace;we have the privilege of bowing inour families in peace, and getting upand speaking our sentiments, andnone to make us afraid.These are great blessings that we asa people enjoy. I bear my testimonythat these things are true and faith-ful. You know these things as wellas I do, and every man who lives hisreligion knows it. The Lord is withhis people, and this kingdom willspread abroad. And when the Lordhas destroyed the wicked, there willbe room for Zion to spread herselfabroad, and to rebuild the waste placesthereof. Then all things spoken ofin the Book of Doctrine and Cove-nants will be fulfilled. It is good toreflect upon these principles, for thepromises will be fulfilled, whether webelieve them or not.I pray God to guide us, that wemay be prepared to partake of eternallife and salvation, and share in allthe benefits of the Gospel of Christ,and of the Holy Priesthood whichhas been revealed to us in our dayand generation, which I ask in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 
 JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.REMARKS by Elder W. Woodruff, delivered in the New Tabernacle, Salt LakeCity, July 19,th, 1868.-[REPORTED BY DAVID W. EVANS.]-THE GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST—ESSENTIAL TO ABIDE ITS LAWS.I am requested to occupy a littletime this afternoon in speaking tothe people. It is a great satisfaction tome, and I presume it is to all Latter-day Saints who enjoy their religion,to contemplate and realize that Godis our friend, and that we have theGospel of Jesus Christ. Religion isvery popular in the world, and hasbeen for many generations; and thereligions of the world are as variousas the temporal governments of theworld. But for a person or commu-nity to know and understand forthemselves the true gospel, the gos-pel of Jesus Christ, must be a sourceof great consolation.I have taken a great deal of satis-faction in the gospel of Christ; infat it has been my life. I have tra-veled and preached this gospel forthe last thirty-five years, more or less,either to the world or to the Saintsof God. And in my contemplationsand meditations, when I have hadsufficient of the spirit of God uponme, I have realized the gifts andgraces and blessings pertaining to the salvation of men in the gospel ofChrist.The governments of the world arevaried.  We have despotic, monarch-ical and republican governments, andin order to become a citizen of anyone of them we have to obey the lawsof that government. A great dealhas been said about the form of go-vernment, and the constitution underwhich we live. They have been thepraise of all Americans, and perhapsof people living in other portions ofthe earth. We consider that we havebeen blessed as a nation in possessingthe freedom and privileges guaran-teed by the Constiution of the Uni-ted States. They have been a richlegacy from our fathers. We consi-der our form of government superiorto any other on the earth. It gua-rantees to us "life, liberty and thepursuit of happiness." And whilethe inhabitants of many other go-vernments have been tyranicallybound up, and their minds controlledin certain channels, and they havebeen deprived of the right of libertyof speech and of many other rightsvalued by freemen, ours has guaran-teed unto us all the liberty that can beenjoyed by man. Still, I have manytimes thought that we, as AmericanCitizens, have not prized the giftsand blessings guaranteed to us bythe Constiution of our country. Forthe last few years, especially, theConstitution at times, has been look-ed upon as a matter of the smallestconsequence. In some respects, how-ever, it has been a blessing to us asa people, and it is to the whole na-tion, as far as it is carried out.  Butin order to fully receive its blessingswe have to honor its precepts.Now it is just so with the gospelof Jesus Christ. Those who believeit and obey it in sincerity enjoy fargreater blessings than are enjoyed byothers. But we have to abide by thelaws of the gospel in order to enjoyits blessings and privileges. 
 THE GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST, ETC.From my childhood up, I have prized the gospel. Before I heard itproclaimed, I felt when perusing theaccount of the blessings and privi-leges enjoyed by the ancient Saintsand servants of God that I wouldhave been glad to have lived in thosedays when the priesthood had thekeys of the kingdom of God, whenthey had power to unlock the hea-vens and to command the elementsand they would obey; when they hadpower to heal the sick, cast out de-vils, cause the lame to walk, and theblind to see; when they could receivecommunication from God, and com-mune with holy angels. I could seea power, glory and exaltation in thoseprinciples for which I looked in vainamong men in my day; and I desired to live to see a people by whom suchblessings would be again enjoyed. Ihave lived to see that day. The firsttime I ever heard this gospel preach-ed, I felt that it was the first gospelsermon I had ever heard; and I wentforth and was baptized and receivedthe testimony that it was true, and Ihave rejoiced in this gospel from thatday to this, because I know it is true.And I have wondered many timesthat there are not more of the inha-bitants of the earth who will open their ears and hearts to hear and re-ceive it that they may enjoy its bles-sings both in time and eternity.This Gospel makes us free. Wasthere ever a more free people thanthe Latter-day Saints are? No, there never was in any age of the world.There is not anything that will givea man joy or consolation, or anyblessing temporal or spiritual, butwhat is within our reach as far asman in a mortal state has a right toreceive.When we contemplate the giftsand blessings the Gospel of Christhas given to us, we of all men shouldbe the most cheerful, thankful andfaithful, and should honor our cal-ling, and acknowledge the hand ofour God in the mercies which weenjoy.All men who have obeyed thisGospel for the love of the truth, andwhose minds have been inspired bythe Spirit and power of God, havefelt to rejoice and take consolation init, and they have felt a great desireto spread the knowledge of its prin-ciples among their fellow men. When first embraced by them it has seemedto them as though they could con-vince the world; and they have beenanxious to lay these principles beforetheir father's household, their uncles,aunts, cousins, neighbors and friends,believing that they would receive it.I felt so myself. But I, with many others, have found myself mistakenin a great measure. I have traveledhundreds and thousands of miles topreach this Gospel. In my travelsI have warned many thousands ofmy fellow men; but have been theinstrument, in the hand of God, ingathering very few when comparedwith the many I have preached to.This has been the experience of allthe Elders. We have found, whenwe came to lay these principles be-fore the world, that they were notready to receive them. There wouldbe one of a family and two of a citywho would open their ears and heartsand would receive the truth, and ga-ther home to Zion. That is the waythe Kingdom of God has been builtup in this and every other age of theworld. There have been but a fewhere and there that have been quali-fied or prepared to receive and abidethe law of God. The minds of the majority have been prone to evil asthe sparks to fly upward; and it hasbeen a hard matter to get the inha-bitants of the earth to listen to ourmessage, and then make it a sub-ject of prayer and receive and obey 
 DISCOURSE BY ELDER WILFORD WOODRUFF,DELIVERED JUNE 27, 1875, IN THE SECOND WARD SCHOOL-HOUSE, SALTLAKE CITY, AT THE FUNERAL SERVICES OF JOHN HOUSEMAN, AGED SIXYEARS, AND WILLIE FRANKLIN, AGED FOUR YEARS, SONS OF WILLIAM ANDANN WHEELER, BURNED TO DEATH AT WANSHIP, SUMMIT COUNTY, U. T.,JUNE 24, 1875.(Reported by David W. Evans.)LITTLE CHILDREN ARE INNOCENT, AND ALL WILL BE SAVED—GOD, APERSONAGE OF TABERNACLE—THE LIFE OF THE SAVIOR, A LIFE OFSUFFERING—SECOND COMING OF CHRIST.I am entirely dependent this morn-ing upon the Spirit of the Lord toguide and direct me in what I maysay upon this painful occasion.Those who have assembled here—Brother and Sister Wheeler, and their 
 JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.friends who mourn with them, aredependent upon the same source for comfort in their serious bereavement;and in fact we are all dependent upon the blessing and Spirit of the Lord in all the labors of life, and I hope that, in our services this morning, a large measure of that Spirit will be impar-ted unto us.I feel disposed to read the ##Job 1|first chapter## of Job as a preliminary to any remarks I may make. -[The speaker read the first chapter of the Book of Job.]- We also see in read-ing the history of Job that the devil did not finish with him there, as it seems the devil had another conversa-tion with the Lord on this subject, in which he informed the Lord that a man would give anything for his life, and that if he, the devil, touched Job's flesh, he would certainly curse God. And it seems from reading this history that the Lord put Job into the hands of the devil,to do as he pleased with him, only to spare his life. Of coursethe history is familiar to you all who have read the Bible, and you are aware that the devil smoked Job, and he was covered with boils from the crown of his head to the soles of his feet, so that he was in great dis-tress, trouble and tribulation, yet in the midst of it all he did not sin, but acknowledged the hand of the Lord.I may say, with regard to the casewhich has brought us together this morning, it is a little similar to thatof Job. We meet with some strangethings in the history of our lives inthe dispensations and dealings of Godwith men. In the case before us weare called to mourn the loss of twochildren taken from Brother andSister Wheeler, we may say as sud-denly and, in one sense of the word,as miraculously, as were the sons anddaughters of Job. His affliction con-sisted of not only in the loss of twochildren, but of all his children andalso of all the possessions that hehad, yet still, under all this he said—"Naked came I out of my mother'swomb, and naked shall I return thither; the Lord gave, and theLord hath taken away; blessed be thename of the Lord." [##Job 1:21##]I know very well it is hard for anyperson to be called to pass throughthe scenes that we sometimes arecalled to pass through in this life, itis so in the case before us this morn-ing. The loss of these little children,taken away as they were, is certainlypainful, not only to the parents, butto eyery person who reflects; and itis a very hard matter for any of usteo enter into and appreciate the depthof sorrow which parents feel on occa-sions like this, it is difficult to bringthe matter home to our own heartsunless we have been called to passthrough similar affliction and sorrow.At the same time there is no doubtthat we all sympathize with ourfriends when called to pass throughtrials and bereavement. And I willhere say to Brother and SisterWheeler, and to all my friends, thereare a great many worst things in thisworld than the case we are now call-ed to mourn.Our children are taken away fromus in infancy and childhood, and theyare taken away as Job's were, in onesense of the word, through the dis-pensation of Providence, causing ussevere trials. This we will acknow-ledge; but, as I have already said,there are many things in this worldthat are far more painful and afflict-ing than to have our children burnedto death. My friends may ask—"What is Brother Woodruff drivingat in this remark?" I will tell you.I have lived in these valleys, twenty-seven years, since the pioneers camehere. I have seen a whole genera-tion of men and women grow up in 
 JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.it, and abide in its laws and ordi-nances in faithfulness and truth untodeath.When Father Smith gave me mypatriarchial blessing he told me Ishould bring my father's house intothe Church and Kingdom of God. Ihad never seen any member of myfather's house from the time I obeyedthe gospel until I received my patri-archial blessing, and I rested a gooddeal on this blessing. Now, all menwho were acquainted with Father Jo-seph Smith know that when he laidhis hands upon a man's head it seem-ed as if the heavens and the heartsof men were open to him, and hecould see their past, present and fu-ture. And that is the way all menin the holy priesthood should feel;and whether patriarchs, prophets,apostles or elders they should live soas to enjoy the spirit and power oftheir office and calling. This is ourprivilege, but we do not always liveso; but this was the way with FatherSmith. After I had been with Zi-on's Camp up to Missouri I returnedeast, and on my way I visited myfather's household in Connecticut and preached the gospel to them, andbaptized my father and all who werein his house. In this I was blessed.I also baptized some of my uncles,aunts and cousins; but I left a nu-merous host that did not receive mymessage; they were not ready to re-ceive my testimony; a few of themdid, and some of them have gatheredto Zion. I have rejoiced in thisand also in preaching the gospel tothe world, because I have known thatthe gospel and the message which Ihad were from God. I knew thenthat they were true, and I know itto-day; and I know they will have their effect on the nations of the earth.The gospel which we preach is thepower of God unto salvation to everyone who believes, both high and low,rich and poor, Jew and Gentile.There is no man who will receivesalvation without it; no man can re-ceive exaltation and be crowned withthe fullness of salvation in the pre-sence of God without receiving thefullness of the everlasting gospel ofthe Son of God.All men who have received a glo-rious salvation and resurrection andhave gone to receive their reward inthe presence of God, have had to gothere by keeping the laws that Hegave them. They have had to obeythe gospel of Christ on the earth;they have had to receive the law andabide that law in the flesh that theymight receive a fullness in the resur-rection. It will take just as much tosave the Latter-day Saints and theinhabitants of the earth in this gene-ration as it did to save Adam, Enoch, Seth, Moses, Elijah, Elias or Jesusand the apostles. There is no changenor variableness with the gospel ofChrist; its ordinances are the sameto-day, yesterday and forever. Asthe Apostle Paul said "If we or anangel from heaven preach any othergospel than that we have preachedlet him be accursed." [##Galatians 1:8##]This gospel has been revealed tous. We have received the light ofit and rejoice in it. By it and itsAuthor we have been sustained fromthe commencement until to-day. Thegospel of Christ has never disap-pointed any man or woman that everdwelt in the flesh. The God of hea-ven—the Author of this gospel—has never disappointed any bodywho ever proved faithful to its pre-cepts. And if the inhabitants ofthe earth expect salvation throughany other medium they will be dis-appointed. Whater salvation theymay get, they will not be saved inthe celestial kingdom of God. If they have another glory it will be 
 LITTLE CHILDREN ARE INNOCENT, ETC.these valleys of the mountains, andthey have become parents. I haveseen some, and I will not say a greatmany, but I have seen some youngmen, I say nothing about maidens,who have met with untimely deathsand who have gone to the grave dis-graced, and a dishonor to themselvesand to their parents. Circumstancesof this kind are far more painful toany parent in the world than it is fortheir children to meet with suddendeath by accident or any other way. I do not make these remarks to applyto Brother and Sister Wheeler, fornone of us know what course ourchildren will take. We set good ex-amples before them, and we strive toteach them righteous principles, butwhen they come to years of accounta-bility they have their agency andthey act for themselves.Many things are transpiring in theearth to-day which we should regardas great calamities and as grievous tobe borne if we had to pass throughthem. Think of these late earth-quakes in South America, eight thou-sand people out of ten thousand inone city sunk in the earth in a fewmoments. And then, the tremen-dous floods that are sweeping overFrance and other parts of the earth,causing the death of hundreds andthousands of men, women and chil-dren. All these things are in fulfill-ment of the revelations of God, andof the judgments which he has pro-mised should come upon the earth inthe last days. One of the purposeswhich the Lord has in view in gather-ing his Saints to the valleys of themountains is that they may not sharein the sins or partake of the plaguesof Babylon; therefore we have rea-son to rejoice before the Lord becauseof his mercies and blessings unto us.And with regard to a case like thisbefore us this morning—the loss ofthese children—I want to say a fewwords for the consolation of thosewho are sorrowing. In the first placethese children are innocent before theLord; as to their death and the causethereof, that is in the hands of God,and we should not complain of theLord or his dispensations any morethan Job did. These children havebeen taken away very suddenly, andin such a manner as to cause greatsorrow and distress to their parents,but there is this consolation connectedwith the matter—they are innocent,they are not in transgression. Theyhave paid the law of death whichGod passed on Adam, and all his pos-terity; but when their spirits lefttheir bodies and got into the spiritworld their trouble and affliction wereover. Their death was a very pain-ful one, but their suffering is nowover, and in a few years from nowthey will come forth out of theirgraves in the morning of the resur-rection, not marred by fire or any ele-ment, but clothed with glory, immor-tality and eternal life, in eternalbeauty and bloom, and they will begiven into the hands of their parents,and they will receive them in thefamily organization of the celestialworld, and their parents will havethem for ever. They will live aslong as their God lives. This, to Latter-day Saints, who believe in theresurrection, should be a source ofcomfort and consolation.Why our children are taken fromus it is not for me to say, for Godnever revealed it unto me. We areall burying them. I have buried one-third of the children that have beengiven onto me. I have had somethirty children born to me, and tenof them are buried, all of themyoung. The question may arise withme and with you—"Why has theLord taken away my children?" Butthat is not for me to tell, because Ido not know; it is in the hands of the 
 THE GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST, ETC.the glory of the law they keep in theflesh. If a man cannot abide a celes-tial law, he cannot receive a celestialglory, if a man cannot abide a terres-trial law he cannot receive a terres-trial glory; and if he cannot abide atelestial law he cannot receive a te-lestial glory, but will have to dwellin a kingdom which is not a king-dom of glory. This is according tothe revelations of God to us.Here is where we differ from theworld of Christendom. Because wehave received the Gospel in its full-ness and plainness, with its ordinan-ces, its organization, with the priest-hood with its keys, powers and bles-sings, its revelations and its light,truth and inspiration and its HolyGhost. Everything which belongsto it in one age of the world belongsto it in another. In this the Gentileworld lie in darkness; they have fol-lowed the same example of unbeliefas ancient Israel, by rejecting theGospel and persecuting the Saints,and putting them to death, and shed-ding the blood of the prophets andapostles and those who held the Gos-pel of the Kingdom of God in theirday; and they have gone into thewilderness of darkness and unbelief,and remained so, until God restoredthe Gospel in this day.Well, we as a people should rejoicein this Gospel, for in possessing itwe are blessed above our fellow men.No matter what the feelings of theworld may be, they do not make thetruth of God without effect, nota bit of it. God has set His handin these last days to restore Israel,and to call upon the inhabitants ofthe earth for the last time. Ancient-ly the Jews were called first. Jesuscame to them—his brethren—first;the Gospel of the Kingdom was es-tablished, and the Church organizedamong them first; they rejected Himand put to death their Shiloh, theirKing, who had come to deliver them.He did not come as they expected;they looked for a King, a monarch,a leader, a warrior coming in theclouds of heaven with power andgreat glory to lead them to battleand to set up an earthly kingdomand rule and reign over them; theydid not look for him to come as theLamb slain from the foundation ofthe world. They had not the light,and consequently rejected Him andHis message and put Him to death,and the Kingdom was given to theGentiles—first to the Jews, then tothe Gentiles. In these last days itcame to the Gentiles first; and whenthey have proven themselves un-worthy, it will be given to the Jews.It is to the Gentiles that we havebeen called to preach the Gospel.For the last thirty-eight years,since its establishment, have the El-ders of this church been laboringand traveling for the spread of theprinciples of this Gospel. You maytrack history from the days of theancient patriarchs to the days of Jo-seph Smith, and you cannot find anyaccount of men who have traveled asthe Elders of Israel have. Jesus toldHis disciples to go into all the worldand preach the Gospel to every livingcreature, and he that believed andwas baptized should be saved, andhe that believed not should be damn-ed. But we can trace almost everymile of the travels of the ancientApostles, and with the exception ofPaul, their travels were confined toAsia, and chiefly to Jerusalem andJudea. But the Elders of this churchhave traveled in every gentile nationunder heaven that would receive themessage. And as a general thingthe Elders have been faithful in thiswork among the nations; and wehave not yet ceased to send them tothe gentiles, and we shall continue todo so until they entirely reject the 
 JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.Lord, and it has been so from thecreation of the world all the waydown. Children are taken away intheir infancy, and they go to the spiritworld. They come here and fulfillthe object of their coming, that is,they tabernacle in the flesh. Theycome to receive a probation and aninheritance on the earth; they obtaina body or tabernacle, and that taber-nacle will be preserved for them, andin the morning of the resurrectionthe spirits and bodies will be reunited,and as here we find children of vari-ous ages in a family, from the infantat the mother's breast to manhood, sowill it be in the family organizationin the celestial world. Our childrenwill be restored to us, as they are laiddown if we, their parents, keep thefaith and prove ourselves worthy toobtain eternal life; and if we do notso prove ourselves our children willstill be preserved, and will inheritcelestial glory. This is my view inregard to all infants who die, whetherthey are born to Jew or Gentile,righteous or wicked. They comefrom our eternal Father and theireternal Mother unto whom they wereborn in the eternal world, and theywill be restored to their eternal pa-rentage; and all parents who havereceived children here according tothe order of God and the holy priest-hood, no matter in what age theymay have lived, will claim those chil-dren in the morning of the resurrec-tion, and they will be given unto themand they will grace their family orga-nizations in the celestial world.With regard to the future state ofthose who die in infancy I do not feelauthorized to say much. There hasbeen a great deal of theory, and manyviews have been expressed on thissubject, but there are many thingsconnected with it which the Lord hasprobably never revealed to any of theProphets or patriarchs who ever appeared on the earth. There aresome things which have not beenrevealed to man, but are held in thebosom of God our Father, and it maybe that the condition after death ofthose who die in infancy is amongthe things which God has neverrevealed;  but it is sufficient for meto know that our children are saved,and that if we ourselves keep the faithand do our duty before the Lord, ifwe keep the celestial law, we shall bepreserved by that law, and our child-ren will be given unto us there, asthey have been given here in thisworld of sorrow, affliction, pain anddistress. It has no doubt been amarvel many times, in the minds ofmen and women, why God everplaced men and women in such aworld as is, why he causes hischildren to pass through sorrow andaffliction here in the body.  TheLord has revealed something to usconcerning this matter, and we havelearned enough about it to know thatthis thing is necessary. We knowthat we are created in the image ofGod, both male and female; andwhoever goes back into the presenceof God our eternal Father, will findthat he is a noble man, a noble God,tabernacled in a form similar to ours,for we are created after his own im-age; they will also learned that he hasplaced us here that we may passthrough a state of probation and ex-perience, the same as he himself didin his day of mortality. And timeand again it has been revealed inthe revelations of God given in ourday, as well as in the Bible and Bookof Mormon, that these things arenecessary in order to enable us tocomprehend good and evil, and tobe prepared for glory and blessingswhen we receive them. As theApostle argues very strongly in theBook of Mormon—"If we nevertaste the bitter how will we know 
 JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.Gospel of Christ. How long thatwill be, it is not for me to say. TheLord is going to make a short workin these last days, He will cut shortHis work in righteousness. By andby the gospel will be taken from thegentiles and will be sent to everybranch of Israel, and all will hear thesound of the Gospel.We are called to build up Zion,and to establish righteousness andtruth; called to build up the kingdomof God, and to warn the nations, thatthey may be left without excuse inthe day of God's judgment and cala-mity. Now, the eyes of the Latter-day Saints, of those at least, wholive their religion, are open. Theyunderstand the signs of the times.They are not walking in darkness;they should not be, at any rate. Theyshould have the light, and understandthe signs of the times, and know thesigns of the coming of the Son ofMan. The world does not under-stand these things; they did not inthe days of Christ. They did notunderstand that Jesus was the Sonof God, come to establish His king-dom and to deliver Israel, and theydo not know it to-day; and thatmakes the difference between themand the Latter-day Saints. Thereason of this is that they have notreceived the Gospel and the Holy Ghost. They have not the inspira-tion of the Almighty. They havea spirit within them; but the in-spiration of the Almighty would givethem understanding if they wouldembrace the Gospel. But beingwithout the Gospel their understand-ings are not enlightened. They donot understand the scriptures, northe signs of the times. They do notunderstand those principles whichGod reveals to those who keep Hislaws. This is the difference betweenus and the world.  We have an anx-iety for their salvation; so has ourFather in heaven; but they mustabide the law. The God of heavenabides a law, all the hosts of heavenabide laws; they are exalted and glo-rified by law. All the creations ofGod are governed by law. Theearth abides the law for which it wascreated. I have many times said,and I think so still, that all the crea-tions of God, except man, abide thelaw. The beasts of the field, thefowls of the air and the fish of thesea all abide the law by which theywere created. I do not know of anything that breaks the laws of Godbut man, who was made after theimage of God. And we as well asall the other creations of God mustabide the law of our creation in or-der to receive a fullness of glory andblessing. This is the position we oc-cupy as Latter-day Saints. We havethe Gospel, we profess to abide thelaw of the Gospel; and we should, asa people, be awake to the fact thatour Father in heaven has done allHe could for the salvation of the hu-man family. He has made known thelaws necessary for the exaltation andglory of man, and has done all thatcan be done by law. We read thatin Adam all died, and that in Christall were made alive. Jesus has diedto redeem all men; but in order thatthey may be benefitted by His death,and that His blood may cleanse themfrom all actual sin committed in theflesh, they must abide the law of theGospel. The sins done through Adamwe have been redeemed from by the blood of Christ; and in order to ob-tain salvation we must be obedientand faithful to the precepts of theGospel. I feel as though we as apeople ought to rejoice; and we shouldprize these gifts and blesssings Godhas put into our hands, and weshould seek to magnify our callings,and as a people fulfill the expectationof our Father in heaven, and the ex- 
 LITTLE CHILDREN ARE INNOCENT, ETC.how to comprehend the sweet? Ifwe never partake of pain how canwe prize ease? And if we neverpass through affliction, how can wecomprehend glory, exaltation andeternal blessings?"The Lord has said concerningJesus, that he descended below allthings that he might rise above allthings, and comprehend all things.No man descended lower than theSavior of the world. Born in astable, cradled in a manger, he tra-veled from there to the cross throughsuffering, mingled with blood, to athrone of grace; and in all his lifethere was nothing of an earthlynature that seemed to be worthpossessing. His whole life waspassed in poverty, suffering, pain,affliction, labor, prayer, mourningand sorrow, until he gave up theghost on the cross. Still he wasGod's firstborn son and the Re-deemer of the world. The questionmight be asked why the Lordsuffered his Son to come here and tolive and die as he did. When weget into the spirit world, and theveil is withdrawn, we shall thenperhaps understand the whys andwherefores of all these things.In the dispensations and providencesof God to man it seems that we areborn to suffer pain, affliction, sor-rows and trials; this is what Godhas decreed that the human familyshall pass through; and if we makea right use of this probation, theexperience it brings will eventuallyprove a great blessing to us, andwhen we receive immortality andeternal life, exaltation, kingdoms,thrones, principalities and powerswith all the blessings of the fulnessof the Gospel of Christ, we shallunderstand and comprehend whywe were called to pass through acontinual warfare during the fewyears we spent in the flesh.No.3.It certainly does require a gooddeal of the Spirit of the Lord togive comfort and consolation to afather and mother mourning for theloss of their children; and withoutthe Gospel of Christ the separationby death is one of the most gloomysubjects it is possible to contemplate;but just as soon as we obtain theGospel and learn, the principle ofthe resurrection, the gloom, sorrowand suffering occasion by deathare, in a great measure, taken away.I have often thought that, to see adead body, and to see that body laidin the grave, and covered with earth,is one of the most gloomy things onearth; without the Gospel it is liketaking a leap in the dark. But asquick as we obtain the Gospel, assoon as the spirit of man is enlight-ened by the inspiration of the Al-mighty, he can exclaim with one ofold—"Oh grave, where is thy vic-tory, Oh death, where is thy sting?The sting of death is sin, and thegift of God is eternal life, throughour Lord Jesus Christ." ##1 Corinthians 15:55-56## The res-urrection of the dead presents itselfbefore the enlightened mind of man.and he has a foundation for hisspirit to rest upon. That is theposition of the Latter-day Saints to-day. We do know for ourselves, weare not in the dark with regard tothis matter; God has revealed it tous, and we do understand the princi-ple of the resurrection of the dead,and that the Gospel brings life andimmortality to light. We have re-ceived the Gospel, and if we are trueto the principles of that Gospel aslong as we live, we shall be madepartakers of immortality, exaltationand glory.I know very well that the loss oftheir children in this terrible man-ner is a sad affliction to brother andsister Wheeler. It was a sad afflic-tion for Job when his children andVol. XVIII. 
 THE GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST, ETC.pectation of those who have gone be-fore us.The ancients are not perfect with-out us, neither are we perfect withoutthem.  The old prophets and apos-tles had their day to labor in warn-ing the world. Noah preached tothe inhabitants of the world, andshowed his works by his faith,though he did not save a greatmany. Abraham, Isaac and Jacob,Moses, Elias and the prophets, Jesusand the Apostles all had their day.Their work is finished.  They sleepin peace.  This is our day, and weshould labor while the day lasts; by-and-by  night will come when no mancan work.  We shall not have 365years as Enoch had to prepare Zionfor translation. [##Genesis 5:23##]As I before remarked the Lord isgoing to make short His work, or noflesh can be saved.  There are greatevents at our doors, and the Saintsof God should be on their watch-tower.  We should have our eyes,ears and hearts open to see, hear, un-derstand and receive the counsels and reproof revealed through the mouthof the servants of God in our day.  The Gospel of Christ is one of thegreatest blessings that can be be-stowed upon man.  Eternal life, theLord says, is the greatest gift ofGod.  We can obtain that, onlythrough obedience to this Gospel.This, brethren and sisters, is ourblessing.  We possess it, and havebeen gathered here by it.  Had itnot been for the Gospel we shouldstill have been in England, the Uni-ted States and abroad among the na-tions of the earth, and Utah wouldhave been a desert sage plain, inha-bited only by crickets and Indians,as it was when we came here.  TheElders of Israel might have preacheduntil they were as old as Methuselah,and we should never have gatheredhad it not been for the inspiration ofthe Almighty.  You and I, and allwho have received the testimony ofJesus Christ know that these thingsare true.  All the Saints of Godamong the nations, who have beenfaithful, have been inspired by thesame spirit to gather home to Zion.  Why have we gathered toZion?  To fulfill the revelations ofGod.  Isaiah and Jeremiah and nearlyall the prophets since the world be-gan have foretold the gathering ofthe people in the last days to estab-lish Zion, from which the law of theLord should go forth to rule the na-tions of the earth, while the word of the Lord should go forth from Jeru-salem.  We are here to do thesethings, and to receive teachings andinstructions that we may be preparedfor the coming of the Son of Man.We are here to be shut up a little while in these chambers of the moun-tains, while the indignation of theAlmighty passes over the nations.For this the Lord through his an-cient servant said, "Come out of her,my people, that ye be not partakersof her sins, and that ye receive not ofher plagues." [##Revelation 18:4##]The question is often asked by sec-tarian ministers, "Why could younot live in New York, Liverpool, orLondon, as well as going to Zion?Because we should be in the midst ofsin and wickedness and abomination,and it would be very difficult, whileso situated, to keep from being pol-luted by the evils which reign uponthe face of the earth at the presenttime.  And to overcome these evilswe have been gathered together,that we may be taught in the prin-ciples of truth, virtue and holiness,and be prepared to dwell in the pre-sence of God.When we embraced the Gospel wehad only just begun our work.  Be-ing baptized into this Church is onlylike learning the alphabet of our

[##Job 1##]I will say to our morning friends,your children are taken away andyou can not help it, we cannot anyof us help it; there is no censureto be given to parents when theydo the best they can. A mothershould not be censured because shecan not save her sick child, and wehave to leave these things in thehands of God. It will be but alittle time until they will be restoredto us; in a little time brother andsister Wheeler will again have thechildren whose loss they now mourn.With regard to the growth, glory,or exaltation of children in the lifeto come, God has not revealed any-thing on that subject to me, eitherabout your children, mine or any-body else's, any further than weknow they are saved. And I feelthat we have to put our trust in theLord in these afflictions, we haveto lean upon his arm and to look tohim for comfort and consolation.We do not mourn under theseafflictions as those who have nohope; we do not mourn the loss ofour children, as though we were nevergoing to see them again, because weknow better. The Lord has taughtus better, and so has the Gospel;the revelations of Jesus Christ haveshown us that they will be restoredto us in the resurrection of the just.And I will here say with regard tothe Gospel of Christ, that it is oneof the greatest mysteries under theheavens to me why there are so fewof the human family, whether in theChristian, Pagan or Jewish world,who take any interest in eternalthings, in the state of man afterdeath. If we read the Bible welearn that Noah, filled with revela-tion, and with the Gospel in hishand, although he labored a hundredand twenty years, could not get asolitary soul except his own familyto go with him for salvation. Itwas similar to the days of the Patri-archs and Prophets, and if we comedown to the days of Christ, we findthat his testimony was rejected bythe rabbis, high priests and thegreat mass of the people, and hechose for his Apostles twelve poorfishermen, and they and very fewof the people, comparatively speak-ing, were all that received the teach-ings of Jesus and followed himthrough the regeneration; while thewhole Jewish nation, with thesefew exceptions, were ready to puttheir Shiloh to death, and he wasthe person upon whom the salvationof the whole house of Israel de-pended. It is just so to-day. Thegreat majority of the people rejectthe words of life and salvationwhich are proclaimed unto them.God, in these last days revealed theGospel of Jesus Christ to JosephSmith by the teachings of angelsout of heaven, and its principles aremade known to the world, and therehas never been a congregation ofGentiles, from that day to this, towhom the Elders of Israel haveborne record of these things, butwhat the Spirit of God has alsoborne record of the truth of theirtestimony; and herein lies the con-demnation of this generation, for"light has come into the world,but men love darkness rather thanlight, because their deeds are evil." ##Doctrine & Convenants 29:45##I ask, in the name of God and huma-nity, why is it that intelligent beings, 
 JOURNAL OF DISCOURSESmother tongue—it is the very firststep.  But having received the firstprinciples of the Gospel of Christ, letus go on to perfection.Brethren and sisters, let us laythese things to heart and try to rea-lize that the eyes of God, of angels,of those who have gone before us arewaiting and watching for the comple-tion of our labors.  We have every-thing to stimulate us to action to dothe will of God and overcome eviland be humble, obedient, diligent andfaithful.  Let us labor faithfully whilewe dwell in the flesh, that we may besatisfied with our labors when we getthrough.  We have everything toencourage us here in the valleys ofthe mountains.  We have the bles-sings of God visible over us day byday in our preservation, and in thepreservation of the crops and thefruits of the soil.  The hand of theLord has been over the land.  Whowould have been believed twentyyears ago, if he had said that this bar-ren, desolate waste would have be-come like the garden of Eden?  Itnever could have been done exceptthrough the mercies and blessings ofGod.  His promises have been ful-filled to us, and we can just as wellacknowledge His hand in these tem-poral blessings as in anything else,for the hand of God is in it all.I pray that God will bless us withHis spirit, and give us power tomaintain our integrity, magnify ourcallings and to be faithful to our co-venants, to our God and to eachother, that we may overcome theworld, the flesh and the devil and beprepared to inherit eternal life, forJesus' sake:  Amen. 
 LITTLE CHILDREN ARE INNOCENT, ETC.made in the image of God, take nointerest in their condition afterdeath? They know they are goingto die, and, if they have any sense orreflection, they know they will liveafter the death of their mortal bodies;still men will sell their eternal inter-est for money, for a few hundred ora few thousand dollars they will sellall the interest they have in theeternal world; in fact, they take nointerest in their eternal welfare.Their cry is—"Give me gold, silverand honors the few years I spendhere, and eternal life may go whereit pleases, I have no interest in that."I ask again, why is it that the humanfamily take no interest in thesethings? We have preached overforty years. I have been engaged inthat work over that time, and haveproclaimed the words of eternal lifeto millions of people, and have tra-veled more than a hundred thousandmiles in so doing, and, as the Pro-phet has said, I have found one of afamily and two of a city who havehad eyes to see, ears to hear, andhearts to understand, and they havebeen gathered up from the variousnations of the earth into the moun-tains of Israel, and here to-day wehave a little handful of people, out ofthe twelve hundred millions whodwell upon the earth, who feel aninterest in building out the Zion andkingdom of God upon the earth, andwho are desirous to be saved inthat kingdom.Now I would rather be poor all the days of my life, I would rather gothrough poverty and affliction, itmatters not how severe, even to thesacrifice of my own life, then losesalvation and eternal life, becauseI have faith in it, and always had. Ialways have had faith in the Bibleand in the revelations of God since Iwas a boy like these sitting on theseseats, eight or ten years old, when Iwent to the Presbyterian Sundayschool and read about Jesus Christ.I believed then that he was theSavior of the world; I believed thatthe Old and New Testament was true.I believe it to-day. What would itprofit a man to gain the whole worldand lose his own soul? What willa man give in exchange for his soul? ##Mark 8:35-36##When he comes into the presence ofGod he can't buy it. This is theposition of the world. There is noneof us going to live but a little while;we shall all pass away soon, and oureternal destiny depends upon thefew days, weeks, months or yearsthat we spend here in the flesh. Doyou not think it will pay a man or awoman to keep the commandmentsof God? It will, and when we enjoythe Holy Spirit, when we are tryingto live our religion here on the earth,we are the happiest people on God'sfootstool, no matter what our circum-stances may be. I do not carewhether we are rich or poor, whetherin happiness or affliction, if a manis living his religion and enjoys thefavor and Spirit of God, it makesno difference to him what takes placeon the earth. There may be earth-quakes, war, fire or sword in the land,but he feels that it is all right withhim. That is the way I feel to-day.With regard to the Gospel ofChrist, it is a thing that we shouldall labor to maintain the few yearsthat we spend here. When I getthrough with this life and go into thespirit world, I do not want to misswhat I have in anticipation. I havealways desired to see the Savior,Father Adam, Enoch, Abraham,Isaac, Jacob, and those old Prophetswe read about in the Bible. I de-sired this before I heard this Gospel,I desire it to-day; and I do not wishto miss this, for nothing in this worldwould pay me for such a sacrifice.But I know that it requires constant 
 JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.warfare, labor and faithfulness beforethe Lord in order for us to keep infellowship with the Holy Spirit, andto live in such a manner that we mayobtain these blessings. Jesus says—"Strait is the gate and narrow theway that leads to eternal lives, andfew there are who find it, while broadis the way that leads to death, andmany there be who go in thereat." ##Matthew 7: 13-14##The road to death is broad enough tocatch the whole world, and they donot like to walk in the strait andnarrow one, they do not like to keepthe celestial law. I have met withprofessed ministers of the Gospel, inmy travels, at whose tables I haveeaten and drank, and I have giventhem the Book of Mormon and theBook of Doctrine and Covenants,and have talked to, and labored withthem, and I have known some ofthem spend days and days in thiswarfare, trying to decide which to do,whether to receive the Gospel ofChrist, and take the reproach of theworld, or reject it; and I may saythat in nine cases out of ten theyhave come to the conclusion to rejectit. When I visited Fox Island thefirst time, I went to the house ofMr. Newton, a Baptist minister; andI stayed with him. But first I wentto his church, and heard him preach,and when he got through I wantedto bear record of the Gospel, for Ihad a message to that people, and Iappointed a meeting for 4 o'clockin the afternoon, and I've preached theGospel to them, and Mr. Newton tookme to his home, and I gave him theBook of Mormon and the Book of Doctrine and Covenants, and for tendays that man walked about his roomuntil midnight trying to decide whathe should do. The Spirit of theLord bore record to him that mytestimony was true, and he felt thatif he obeyed the Gospel which I hadproclaimed unto him he would losehis good name and honor among men,but that if he did not receive it, hewould be damned. Finally he re-rejected it, and the consequence wasthat he became a vagabond, and amiserable outcast. I baptized allhis flock who owned any portionof the meeting-house, and if he hadembraced the Gospel and been gath-ered with them he would have beenhere and saved in the kingdom ofGod, instead of the vagabond thathe has since become. I merely men-tion this to show how the minds ofsome men are acted upon by the tid-ings of the Gospel. Some of themfeel that it would be a great reproachto obey the Gospel and to keep thecommandments of God. Bless yoursouls, we who obey the Gospel ofChrist are all in good company.Whenever you are persecuted forrighteousness sake, said Jesus, rejoiceand be exceeding glad for so perse-cuted they the Prophets and Apostleswhich were before you.I will say to all, whether in thechurch or in the world, it will payyou to keep the commandments ofGod. Here is a man who has a wifethat he thinks a great deal of; theyhave lovely children, and the ties ofaffection bind them closely. Nowshould not such a man have respectenough for God to keep his com-mandments, and so secure to himselfhis wife and his children in the celes-tial world after the resurrection?But you cannot get worldlings tobelieve in such a principal; thepeople, as I said before, have not in-terest enough in the things of thekingdom of God to be willing to keepthe commandments of God.I say to the Latter-day Saints, weshould be faithful to our God. Weare blessed above all the people thatbreathe the breath of life upon theearth, and we are blessed above allother dispensations and generations 
 LITTLE CHILDREN ARE INNOCENT, ETC.of men, for the Lord has put intoour hands the power to build up hisZion upon the earth, never more tobe thrown down, and this is what noother generation has ever been calledto do. But although this is the mis-sion of the Latter-day Saints, wehave a continual warfare to wage—awarfare with the powers of darkness,and a warfare with ourselves. Theancients had a similar experience topass through—they had their dayof trials, troubles and tribulations.Enoch labored three hundred andsixty-five years in building of Zion,and he had the opposition of thewhole world. But the Lord blessedhim so that he maintained his groundfor that length of time, and gatheredtogether a few out of the nations ofthe earth, and they were sanctifiedbefore the Lord, and he had to takethem away, and the saying went forth—"Zion is fled." So you may tracedown all the Prophets. Read thehistory of Ezekiel, Jeremiah, Isaiahand others, and you will find that itwas a warfare for them all the waythrough. And so with Jesus and theApostles. But all those dispensa-tions have passed and gone into thespirit world, and they have their eyesupon us, and in fact God our heavenlyFather and all under him—the wholeheavenly host, have their eyes turnedtowards the Latter-day Saints, be-cause this is the great dispensationof which Adam, Enoch and all theancient patriarchs and Prophets havespoken,  in which shall take place thefinal redemption of the House ofIsrael, the restoration of their king-dom, the rebuilding of their city andTemple, the restoration of theiroracles and Priesthood, of the Urimand Thummim, and the preparationfor the final winding up scene in thelast days; all these things will takeplace in the dispensation in which weare permitted to live.Let us, then, try and fulfill andperform our duties as good Latter-daySaints. Let us bear with each other'sfaults, and bear the yoke of Christ, live our religion and keep the com-mandments of God. Let us try andbring up our children in the nurtureand admonition of the Lord. Letus set them good examples and teachthem good principles while they areyoung. They are given to us by ourheavenly Father; they are our king-dom, they are the foundation of ourexaltation and glory; they are plantsof renown, and we should strive tobear them up before the Lord, andteach them to pray to, and to havefaith in, the Lord as far as we can,that when we are past and goneand they succeed us on this stage ofaction, they may bear off the greatlatter-day work and kingdom of Godupon the earth. I do not believethat the day is very far distant whenthe revelations which God has givenconcerning the last days will havetheir fulfillment. I believe there aremany children now living in themountains of Israel who will nevertaste death, that is, they will dwellon the earth at the coming of theLord Jesus Christ. I will acknowledgethat there is a great deal to be done,and the Lord has not revealed to manthe day or the hour, but he has re-vealed the generation; and the figtrees are now putting forth theirleaves in the eyes of all the nations,indicating the near approach of thesecond coming of the Son of Man. It is my faith that hundreds andthousands of the children that havebeen given to us will be alive in theflesh when Christ comes in the cloudsof heaven in power and great glory.The Lord will not disappoint theinhabitants of the earth in these lastdays in regard to his second coming,any more than he has with regard toother great events and dispensations. 
 JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.We live in a very different ageand generation; we live in the dayand time when God has set his handto fulfill a measure of prophecy andrevelation to man, in the great dis-pensation of all dispensations. Asan individual I do not believe thatmany more years will roll over theheads of the inhabitants of the earthbefore the resurrection will be uponthem, and then these children,which we are called to bury to-day,will come forth from their graves,clothed with glory, immortality, andeternal life. You may ask why Ibelieve this. I believe it because therevelations of God say so. I readthe Scriptures, and I believe that therevelations and prophecies thereincontained mean what they say, andI also believe that the saying ofevery Prophet or Apostles spokenunder the inspiration of the HolyGhost will have its fulfillment, and,as Paul said, no prophecy of Scripturehath any private interpretation, butholy men of old spake as they weremoved upon by the Holy Ghost. ##2 Peter 1: 20-21##They spake the mind and word ofthe Lord, and none of their sayingswill fail to be fulfilled, for the Lordhas said—"Though the heavens andthe earth pass away, my word shallnot fail, but shall be fulfilled." ##Doctrine & Covenants 56:11## Thatis the way I read prophecy and reve-lation.The Jews will be moved upon byand by, and they will return to theland of their fathers, and they willrebuild Jerusalem. These Laman-ites here will receive the Gospel ofChrist in fulfillment of the revela-tions of God. The Prophets whichhave been shut up in the north coun-try with the nine and a half tribesled away by Shalmanezer, King ofAssyria, thousands of years ago, willcome and remembrance before God;they will smite the rocks and moun-tains of ice will flow down beforethem, and those long lost tribes willcome forth in your day, and mine, ifwe live a few years longer, and theywill be crowned, under the hands ofthe children of Ephraim—the Eldersof Israel, who dwell in the land ofZion. And by and by the testimonyof the Gospel will be sealed amongthe Gentiles, and the Gospel willturn to the whole house of Israel,and the judgments of God will backup the testimony of the Elders ofthis Church, and the Lord will sendmessengers who will go forth andreap down the earth. The unbelievermay say that what we term judg-ments have always prevailed more orless among the nations, and thatGod has nothing to do with them,they are all natural. Well, if theyhave always prevailed, they will pre-vail to a greater extent in these lastdays than ever before, until every-thing that God has spoken shall havecome to pass. Judgments await theworld, and they await this nation,and the day is at hand when theLord will sweep the earth as abesom of destruction. In the visionwhich the Lord gave to Enoch, hesaw the heavens weeping over theearth because of the fall of man; andwhen Enoch asked the Lord—"Whenwill the earth rest from under thecurse of sin?" the Lord told himthat in the last days the earth shouldrest, for then it should be redeemedfrom the sin, wickedness and abomi-nations that were upon it. Theearth is now pretty near ripe, andwhen ripened the Lord will cut themoff. These things are before theLatter-day Saints, but the world donot believe in them any more thanthey believed in the message of Noahor Lot.Brethren and sisters, let us readthe revelations of God for ourselves,and when we read them, let us be-lieve them, and try to live in such a 
 LITTLE CHILDREN ARE INNOCENT, ETC.way that we may be ready for what-ever dispensation the Lord may havein store for us, and so that we canacknowledge his hand as Job did,and not find any fault with him be-cause of his providence is towards us.If we cannot comprehend them now,we shall be able to do so in a littlewhile. The Lord may have purposesin view in his dealings with us thatwe do not understand; I presume hehas. In fact, the whole of the deal-ings of God to man are a mystery.There is a vail over the earth, andit is ordained of God that it shouldbe so, for if it were not so, and ifmen could comprehend eternal things,as God comprehend them, there isno man on earth, no matter howwicked he may be, but what wouldbe willing to keep the commandmentsof God, and to pass through any-thing that God ordained, for thereinhe would see there was salvation andeternal life. But God has an orderin these matters, as he revealed untoJoseph Smith. He said unto Joseph—"I will prove you whether youwill abide in my covenant; if youare not willing to abide in my covenanteven unto death, you are not worthyof me." ##Doctrine & Covenants 98:14-15## And it is so with the Saints.If they are not willing to abide inthe covenants they have made withGod, even unto death if necessary,they are not worthy of him. Jesuslaid down his life to redeem theworld, and passed through sufferingand affliction all his life in order thathe might fulfill the mission whichwas given him. So it is with us.The Lord says—"I am going toprove the children of men." Thereare a few individuals in this dispen-sation who will inherit celestial glory,and a few in other dispensations;but before they receive their exalta-tion they will have to pass throughand submit to whatever dispensationGod may decree. But for all thisthey will receive their reward—theywill become Gods, they will inheritthrones, kingdoms, principalities andpowers through the endless ages ofeternity, and to their increase therewill be no end, and the heart of manhas never conceived of the glory thatis in store for the sons and daughtersof God who keep the celestial law.And yet God has a veil over all inregard to these things. The wholeworld will be judged according to thedeeds done in the body, and they willinherit kingdoms according to thelaws which they have kept, everyman being preserved by the lawwhich he has observed, and all willbe saved in some glory, except thesons of perdition.Now, brethren and sisters, theGospel of Christ is before us. Weare all passing along, and it will onlybe a little time before a good manyof us will be on the other side of thevail. Our friends are passing offevery day, and we look in vain formany with whom we have been fa-miliar in years that are past. If Igo into a congregation of ten thou-sand and enquire for the Saints Iknew in Kirtland, and request themto lift up their hands, it will be likea standard bearer on the mountains,there is only here and there one.You ask a congregation how many ofthem knew Joseph Smith, and it is only here and there one, they arepassing away to the other side of thevail. It is so with us all, we arehastening to the end of life's journey,and a good many of us are on thedownward grade. I ask that whatlittle time I live, I may keep the faithand have the fellowship of the HolySpirit and the Saints of God, thatwhen I get through I may be satis-fied with life, satisfied with my acts,that I may receive a welcome into theKingdom of God. That is all I askand all I labor for. As for riches and 
 JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.wealth, I do not want them if theywill damn me. I would like to haveenough to clothe, shoe and feed mywives and children, and to make themcomfortable, if I can get it honestlybefore the Lord; but I would rathermyself and them be in povertythan to have wealth and be destroyed.Riches are dangerous unless we canuse them so as not to destroy us; ifwe cannot use them to the glory ofGod and for the building up of hisKingdom, we are better withoutthem. I do not expect to live a greatmany years longer. The young, themiddle-aged and the old are dying off.For many years of my life the gospelof Jesus Christ has been a consola-tion to me.  I have spent a good dealmore than half of my life in laboringin this Church. I labored to find thisChurch, I may say, from my child-hood up, and many a midnight hourhave I plead with the Lord, in thewilderness, in the woods, and in mymill, and under various circumstances,that the Lord would let me find apeople who contended for the faithonce delivered to the Saints. I de-sired this from reading the Bible, andfrom the inspiration of the HolySpirit, for in the pages of that sacredbook I learned that a people oncelived upon the earth who had com-munion with God, and they hadpower to command the elements, andthey obeyed them; they conversedwith angels, and had the gifts and graces of a religion which had powerand salvation in it. I could not findthis on the face of the earth. Iprayed to the Lord to let me live tofind such a people, and he promisedthat I should, and I have lived tofind them. I have seen the faces ofProphets and inspired men, and ithas been a great consolation to me.I have my failings and imperfections,and I expect that we are all subjectto them, more or less. I want toovercome them, because I desire topartake of eternal life. I also desirethis for the Saints of God and for thehonest and meek of the earth every-where.I have labored many years, and tra-veled without purse or scrip, preach-ed without money and without price,for the purpose of saving my fellow-men. I labor on Mount Zion to tryand save the dead; I spend a gooddeal of time in this. It is a conso-lation to me, I pray God my heaven-ly Father to bless you and all theLatter-day Saints, and that he willgive us enough of his Holy Spirit tokeep us in the path of duty and rec-titude, virtue and righteousness, thatwe may be justified before him. I pray my heavenly Father that he willbless Brother and Sister Wheeler intheir bereavement, and give them hisHoly Spirit, that, when they lie downat night and rise in the morning andmiss their children they may feel tocommit themselves into the hands ofthe Lord, and realize that their sepa-ration from their little ones is not forever, but that in a little while theywill be restored to them. This ap-plies to us all in the loss of our chil-dren. We lay them away in thegrave, but they will come forth in themorning of the resurrection, and ifwe are faithful to the truth, we shallreceive them and rejoice with them;and when we have passed through thesorrows of mortality and have the joyand glory of the celestial kingdomconferred upon us we shall then knowthat the afflictions of mortality haveprepared us for and enabled us to ap-preciate the blessings which God hasin store for the faithful.May God bless us, and give us hisSpirit, for Jesus' sake, Amen. 
 DISCOURSE BY PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF,IN THE MEETING HOUSE, KAYSVILLE, DAVIS COUNTY, SUNDAY MORNING,DECEMBER 10TH, 1882.(Reported by John Irvine.)HARDSHIP THE HERITAGE OF THE SAINTS—THE NECESSITY OF TRIALFORGIVENESS OF ENEMIES—INSPIRED DREAMS, "GET THE SPIRIT OF GOD"—THE GREAT WORK EXPECTED OF THE SAINTS—LABORS AMONG THE LAMANITES.We have met again this morning to hear and receive instruction and worship the Lord and honor Him upon this holy Sabbath day.The heavens are full of knowledge,full of instruction, full of revela-tion and of principle and decree, and I may say of judgment, all to be made use of in their day and time,and we have a right to all the know-ledge, all the revelation, all the principles of truth, that we can claim by faith and diligence in serv-ing the Lord and in the performance of our duty.I look upon the Latter-day Saintsas occupying a position, I may say equal, at least, to that occupied by the people of any other dispensation that God has ever given to man.We are a blessed people; we are favored of heaven and have received at the hands of our heavenly Father a great many blessings both of the heavens and of the earth, and we, as a people, should be grateful to the Lord our God for the many kind-nesses He has bestowed upon us. We live, in fact, in the dispensation of the fullness of times, the last 
 dispensation in which the Lord will reveal his mind and will to the in-habitants of the earth, the last time in which the Lord will prune his vineyard, the last time in which he will set up his kingdom upon the earth, establish His Church, and build up His Zion, to prepare for the coming of the Son of Man. Andwhile we sometimes feel and have felt in days that are past and gone, to complain because we meet with oppression, persecution and afflic-tion, yet I wish to say to my breth-ren and sisters that these things are the heritage of the Saints of God.Any people whom God calls will meet with opposition from thosewho will not receive the Gospel of Jesus Christ. This has been the legacy of the Saints of God in every age from Father Adam down to our own day. Those that live godly in Christ Jesus must suffer persecution. I believe myself, from the reading of the revelations of God, that it is necessary for a people who are destined to inherit the celestial kingdom to be a tried people. I have never read of the people of God in any dispensation passing through life, as the secta-rian world would say, on flowery beds of ease, without opposition of any kind. I have always looked upon the life of our Savior—who descended beneath all things that He might rise above all things—as an example for His followers. And yet it has always, in one sense of the word, seemed strange to me that the Son of God, the First Begotten in the eternal worlds of the Father,and the Only Begotten in the flesh,should have to descend to the earth and pass through what He did—born in a stable, cradled in a manger,persecuted, afflicted, scorned, a hiss and bye-word to almost all the world, and especially to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and Judea. There was apparently nothing that the Saviorcould do that was acceptable in the eyes of the world; anything and almost everything he did was imputed to an unholy influence. When He cast out devils the people said he did it through the power of Beelze-bub, the prince of devils; when he opened the eyes of the blind, the Pharisees and priests of the day told the man to "give God the glory; we know this man is a sinner." And so all his life through, to the day of his death upon the cross. There is something about all this that ap-pears sorrowful; but it seemed necessary for the Savior to descend below all things that he might ascend above all things. So it has been with other men. When I look at the history of Joseph Smith, I sometimes think that he came as near following the footsteps of the Savior—(although no more so than his disciples)—as any one possibly could. Joseph Smith was called to lay down his life; he sealed his testimony with his blood, and passed through some serious trials and afflictions. In section 122 of the Book of Doctrine and Covenants—the word of the Lord given to the Prophet while in Liberty jail—theLord showed him his condition and position. He refers there to the trials and troubles he was called to pass through, and then compares them with what He Him-self (the Savior) had to endure. He says: ##[Doctrine and Covenants 122:7-9]## "And if thou shouldst be cast into the pit, or into the hands of murderers, and the sentence of death passed upon thee; if thou be cast into the deep; if the billowing surge conspire against thee; if fierce winds become thine enemy; if the heavens gather blackness, and all the ele-ments combine to hedge up the way;and above all, if the very jaws of 
 ##[Doctrine and Covenants 122:7-9]## hell shall gape, open the mouth wide after thee, know thou, my Son,that all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good. The Son of man hath de-scended below them all; art thou greater than He? Therefore, hold on thy way, and the Priesthood shall remain with thee, for their bounds are set, they cannot pass.Thy days are known, and thy years shall not be numbered less; there-fore, fear not what man can do, for God shall be with you for ever and ever." The Lord showed him in this revelation that these afflictions were necessary. We have been called to pass through trials many times, and I do not think we should complain, because if we had no trials we should hardly feel at home in the other world in the company of the Prophets and Apostles who were sawn asunder, crucified, etc., for the word of God and testimony of Jesus Christ.How should we feel towards our enemies? President Taylor of late has called upon us, to exercise towards them the same spirit that was manifested by our Savior upon the cross: "Father forgive themthey know not what they do." We should endeavor to exercise that spirit. Our persecutors, those who would seek to destroy us, do not know what they do. They do not comprehend us at all. Why, bless your souls, if the veil was lifted fromoff the eyes of the President of the United States, from off the eyes of the members of the Congress of the United States, and from off the eyes of our enemies, if this veil were lifted they would bow before the Lord and plead for these "Mor-mons;" they would do this if their eyes were open to see the future consequences of taking a standagainst this Church and kingdom.But there is a veil over their eyes, because of their works of evil; and the day will come when all peoples will mourn who take a stand against the kingdom of God, the Zion of God, the Church of God, and the Lord's anointed; unless they repent they will, when they pass into the other world, go into outer darkness, where there is weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth. It is impos-sible, however, for the Saints of God to inherit a celestial kingdom with-out their being tried as to whether they will abide in the covenants of the Lord or not.Well, I feel we are a blessed peo-ple. We have prospered. The Lord is fighting our battles. The Lord holds the destiny of this nation and all other nations in His hands.Our enemies can go no further than He permits them.We live in a day and time when the Lord has decreed to set up his kingdom for the last time upon the earth. That is the reason we have the privilege of building these Temples and these meeting-houses in the mountains of Israel. The Lord has set his hand to establish his kingdom according to his for-mer promises, and it is going to prevail upon the earth. He has told us to fear not our enemies; that though earth and hell combine against us, they shall not prevail,if we are built upon the rock of Christ.We have come to this earth upon a mission; and we have been gathered to the valleys of these mountains that we may be taught and in-structed in the things of God; thatwe may magnify our calling before the Lord; that we may become saviors upon Mount Zion; that we may have power to go forth and warn the nations of the earth. I look upon the mission of the Latter-day Saints 
 as being as important as that of any people that ever lived in any age of the world. I have often expressed my views with regard to this. As Elders of Israel, very few of us fully comprehend our position, our calling, or relationship to God, our responsi-bility, or work the Lord requires at our hands. The Lord has given unto us the Priesthood. This is conferred upon us that we may administer in the ordinances of life and salvation.But to enable us to perform our duties acceptably, there is one thing we need, one and all of us, and that is the Holy Spirit. While in Winter Quarters, President Young had a dream in which the Prophet Joseph Smith appeared to him and said:"Brother Young, you exhort this people to obtain the Holy Spirit; with it they can do anything that is necessary; without it they cannot build up the kingdom of God." In one of my dreams while in Arizona, I had the same admonition fromPresident Young. I thought he was attending one of our confer-ences. I said to him: "Can you speak to us?" "No," he replied, "I have done bearing my testimony in the flesh; I have merely come to see the people, to see you, to see what you are doing. But I want you to teach the Latter-day Saints to labor to obtain the Holy Spirit. It is one of the most important gifts that the Saints of the living God can possess. You all need this," he said, "in order to build up Zion. If you have not this Spirit—the Spirit of the Holy Ghost, the testimony of Jesus, the testimony of the Father and Son—you cannot get along.But if you are in possession of this Spirit, your minds will be open tocomprehend the things of God."This is true. There is not a man in this Church and kingdom to-day, who, if he is in possession of this spirit, will set his heart upon the things of this world. Any man that loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. We have received something better than the love of gold, silver, houses and lands; we have received the promise of eternal life. We have had conferred upon us the eternal Priesthood by which our heavenly Father has created all worlds and redeemed all worlds and has per-formed all his works from eternity to eternity.Then, we should labor to obtain this Spirit while we are upon the earth that we may overcome every evil. We have a mighty warfare on hand. We have to contend against the world, the flesh and the devil.There are temptations that surround every man and woman, that is, if they attempt to keep the command-ments of God, and no man or woman can inherit eternal life without passing through this warfare in the flesh. Other generations have had their turn. As a people it is our turn to-day. The old patriarchsand prophets have gone, their mis-sions are ended, so far as their testi-mony in the flesh is concerned; but they were valiant in the testimony of Jesus Christ; they kept the law,and they will inherit a celestial glory.I often reflect upon the promises made concerning the Priesthood.The Lord, in a revelation upon this subject, says, ##Doctrine and Covenants 84:33-41|Doctrine and Cove-nants, 33rd to 41st verses##: Whoso-ever is faithful unto obtaining these two Priesthoods of which I have spoken, and the magnifying their calling, are sanctified by the spirit unto the renewing of their bodies. . . . All that my Father hath shall be given unto him.Therefore, all those who receive the Priesthood, receive this oath and 
 ##[Doctrine and Covenants 84:33-41]## covenant of my Father, which he cannot break, neither can it be moved." Now, I sometimes ask myself the question, Do we compre-hend these things? Do we compre-hend that if we abide the laws of the Priesthood we shall become heirs of God and joint-heirs with Jesus Christ? I realize that our eyes have not seen, our ears have not heard, neither hath it entered into our hearts to conceive the glory that is in store for the faithful. We are placed in a position to be proven and tried; we must be, we have been, we shall be, until we get through with our labors in the flesh. The Lord told Joseph Smith that he would prove us in all things, whether we will abide in his covenant, even unto death, that we may be found worthy: "for if we will not abide in his covenant, we are not worthy of him." Jesus Christ abode in the covenant; he kept all the com-mandments while he was upon the earth. He even was baptized by the hands of John, although it was not for the remission of sin, but to fulfill all righteousness. There was no part of the Gospel that Christ did not fulfill, and he called upon Joseph Smith to fulfill the same.This he did. He laid down his life.He went to the spirit world, and he is there watching over this people.He has power there, and so have our brethren who have gone to the other side of the veil. They are laboring for us. They are watching to see how we perform the work left to our charge.I hope we live our religion. I hope we strive to keep the command-ments of God. We occupy a very important position in the world.There are very few of the inhabitants of the earth who are laboring to build up Zion. There are veryfew, apparently, who are able to abide the law of God. There are very few who are willing to sacrifice anything for eternal life and salva-tion, and thousands will have to inherit a kingdom other than the celestial.Nevertheless, my brethren and sisters, we are laboring and progress-ing in this work. Zion is advancing; the kingdom of God is rolling on.The progress of this kingdom has never stopped from the day of its organization; it never will until it has accomplished all for which it has been organized and established on the earth to accomplish. Wehave a great work to do. We are commanded to preach the Gospel to the nations of the earth. The Elders of Israel have been doing this for the last fifty years.  We are still doing it, in the United States and other parts of the world. We shallcontinue to labor among the Gen-tiles just as long as the Lord says we must do so. But at the same time we have now been commanded to turn to a branch of the house of Israel. Here are the Lamanites,thousands and thousands of themsurround us. They look to us for the Gospel of Christ. It is our duty to go to them and organize them,and preach to them the words of life and salvation.Then, again, we have temples tobuild in our day and time, that we may go into them and do a work both for the living and the dead.Our mission is more extended and extensive than we realize. There have been no Prophets, no Apostles,upon the earth for the last 1,800years, that we are much acquainted with, except Nephi, who dwelt upon this continent several hundred yearsafter the death of Christ. There has been no one upon the earth with authority to preach the Gospelto the nations of the earth. Many 
 generations have passed away.  Many thousands of millions have passed into the spirit world. We are now at the end of the sixth thousand years. We are bordering upon the millennium. We are living in the great and last dispensation, in the which the God of Israel ex-pects us, his servants, his sons and daughters, to perform the work which has been left to our charge.It is our duty to build these temples.It is our duty to enter into them and redeem our dead. Joseph Smith is preaching to the spirits in prison;so are all the Elders who have diedin the faith. There are millionsof them there, and they must have the Gospel offered to them. Joseph Smith and others cannot baptize the spirits in water, it is not the law; but their posterity, their sons anddaughters who are living in the last dispensation, are expected to go into these temples and there redeemtheir dead. This is a good work, and it is a great blessing for men and women to have this privilege. Wehave one of these temples finished, and we are doing a great work in that temple. A hundred and sixty-two thousand persons have been baptized for the dead, and nearly seventy thousand endowments have been given in that temple. We have only just begun this work.We want the Logan temple finished,as also the temple at Manti, that the people may go forth and redeemtheir dead. Our forefathers are looking to us to attend to this work.They are watching over us with great anxiety, and are desirous that we should finish these temples and attend to certain ordinances for them, so that in the morning of the resurrection they can come forth and enjoy the same blessings that we enjoy. We are living in the flesh and have the privilege of receiv-ing the Gospel of Christ for our-selves. Our forefathers had not this privilege; and as their posterity when we meet them in the spirit world we shall have the joy and satisfaction of knowing that we did our duty by them while here upon the earth. We occupy a position in this capacity towards them the same as we do to thisgeneration. We occupy the po-sition of Saviors upon Mount Zion.There are a great many things I might mention that are of interest to the Latter-day Saints. We shouldhumble ourselves before the Lord.We have been called to set our houses in order, that we should seek to obtain the spirit of the Lord that it may enable us to magnify our callings in the Priesthood. We are under great responsibility. It won't pay to apostatize; "there is no money in it." Any man who receives this Priesthood and tastes of the word of God, and of the powers of the world to come—any man that turns awayfrom these things, apostatizes, and turns away from the Church of God, shall not, in accordance with the revelations of the Lord to Joseph Smith, "have forgiveness of sins inthis world nor in the world to come."The Lord is laboring for his kingdom. In his hands he holds the destiny of this people and of this generation, and if we will do our duty he will sustain and uphold us and Zion will not be moved out of her place. I am anxious to see the Latter-day Saints rise up and mag-nify their calling. We (the Twelve Apostles, Seventies and others) are called to go forth to preach the Gos-pel to the Lamanites and organize them. I am glad of it. I have felt for a long time that we should turn our attention to them. They are the 
 literal descendants of Abraham,Isaac and Jacob, and the Lord is working in their midst. The vision of their minds is beginning to be opened, and they are to be taught the things of the kingdom of God. I have thought sometimes that they have more faith than the Latter-day Saints. I traveled among them for one year in Arizona and NewMexico. I visited those that dwell in the walled cities. They have some seven villages on the top of a moun-tain from 500 to 1,500 feet high.One thing struck me very forcibly while there. Although a good many of these people are superstitious,some of them sun-worshippers and so forth, yet they seem to be im-pressed with the idea that there is go-ing to be a famine. They have enough grain and dried squash laid up to last them for years, and they thinkthe day is not far off when they willneed that which they have stored up.Don't we believe that a famine willcome? I know some of our sisters are laying up wheat, I hope the Relief Societies will continue to do so, and the brethren should help them. I believe that the Latter-day Saints ought to store up grain against a day of want. The Bibletells us that prior to the coming of the Son of Man there shall be wars and rumors of wars, famines, pes-tilence, and earthquakes. All these things will come to pass.It is a good time with us. TheLord has blessed us. He has blessed the earth for our use; and we ought to dedicate our families, our fields,our crops, our herds, to God. We should pay our tithing according to the law of God. We should attend to all the duties required at our hands. We should not neglect our prayers. Men should seek to enjoy the spirit of God, and the fellowshipof His Holy Spirit. We should seek to do all the good we can, so that we may feel satisfied when we get through.I pray God to bless you with HisHoly Spirit; I pray that he will give us power to fulfill our calling in the Priesthood, power to build upZion, power to finish these templesin which we may redeem our dead.This is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 
 146 JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.THE PEOPLE ASLEEP--THOSE HOLDING THE PRIESTHOOD MUST MAG-NIFY THEIR CALLINGS OR BE REMOVED--THE SAINTS TO BE TRIED EVEN UNTO DEATH.Remarks by Elder Wilford Woodruff, Delivered in the Tabernacle, Great Salt Lake City,December 21, 1856.We have some few missionaries re-turned very recently, and I wish to notify them to meet with us on Tues-day evening in the Seventies' CouncilHall; and we want all the Bishops in the city, and the missionaries whohave been apppointed to labor here, to meet at the same place, on thesame evening.I attended the High Priests' meet-ing last evening, in company with brothers F. D. Richards and LorenzoSnow, and I want to say to all the High Priests in this city, I want them to meet with their quorum; and weare going to meet with you; the Twelve will meet with you and withthe Seventies, and I want every manwho is a president of Seventies tomeet with his quorum at the timeappointed.  There was not more than half the High Priests out last evening.We are called upon to wake up andreform, and it makes me feel curious when I go into the High Priests'meeting, and see not one half of themthere when a meeting is held to pre-pare them to wake up the people.I want this people to listen to what they have heard to-day. I feel thank-ful to see brother Kimball again comeinto this stand. I expressed my feel-ings when I saw the sacrament re-moved from the table; I felt that it was a loud sermon to this people; Isaid I knew not what would come next; I thought likely the Presidencywould be removed next from us, notthat I expected they would die; bro-ther Grant, however, is gone; the load he undertook to draw killed him,the same load that was pressing thePresident of this Church to the earth, when Jedediah rose up to bear it off; his spirit was strong enough, but asbrother Kimball said, his mortal bodywas not strong enough to bear itsweight. The First Presidency havenot addressed this people but a littletime since the sacrament was removed, therefore I was glad to see and hearbrother Kimball to-day.Although Jedediah has been takenfrom us, that load, which in a measurehas been removed from the Presi-dency of this Church, has not return-ed unto them, and I pray it never may. When Jedediah M. Grant wentforth among the people through thenorth country and this city to carryout the views of President Young, and lifted up his voice like the trumpof the angel of God, and called uponthe people to awake out of their deep sleep and repent of their sins and turn unto God, the people were sosound asleep that they did not realizethe importance of his mission; manyfelt that his labors and reproofs wereunnecessary and uncalled for, the peo-ple did not know what he was doing.Had the vision of their minds beenopen as was brother Grant's, and thosewho sent him, they would have seen and felt the importance of that mission.I tell you the people have beenasleep, and they are not yet half awake, they have not more than oneeye open, and not that quite; when we hear such things as we have to- 
 THE PEOPLE ASLEEP, ETC. 147day, this people have got to wake upto righteousness. I have lived twenty-three years in the Church, and I havebeen acquainted with Prophets andhave heard them prophesy, and I have not yet seen their words fall tothe ground unfulfilled; and when they speak Israel should hear and obey.We have been called upon, some of us, as missionaries to the people ofthis city, to wake them up. We shall be among you, brethen, and we do not intend to let you sleep. BrotherOrson Hyde is with us to-day; he hashad a dream which refers to the wheatand the thrashing floor. I am glad brother Hyde is with us, and I wantto say to you brother Hyde, in the name of the Lord, wake up and riseup in the midst of your brethren theTwelve, and lead them forth into thefield of labor, and we will stand by you; if you will lead the Twelve, brother Hyde, in the spirit and power of your calling as an Apostle of  Jesus Christ, you will see your brethren by your side; we will back you up, andstep forth and help to bear that mighty load which has rested upon the Presidency of the Church like a mountain, and nearly crushed themto the ground.  As a Quorum we havegot to more fully obtain the spirit and power of our Apostleship and take more upon ourselves the care and burthen of the Church and Kingdom of God than we have done.The Twelve Apostles have got torise up and magnify their calling, orthey will be removed out of their place. The High Priests, the Seven-ties, the Bishops, and every other Quorum of the Church and King-dom of God have got to do the same,or they also will be removed; we can-not sleep any longer with the Priest-hood of Almight God resting uponus, and the work that is required atour hands. WE CANNOT SLEEP. I do not wonder that calling on thepeople to wake up has killed one man, and it will kill more if we do not re-spond to the call; mortality cannot endure the visions of eternity thatrests on them when they look on thePriesthood and see the position they are in; it has nearly laid brother Young in the grave; he felt he couldnot live until some man rose up andstarted the work of reformation.I know it is my duty to wake up and enter into the labors of my call-ing, and it is the duty of Elder Hyde,and the duty of every other man in Israel that bears this Priesthood todo the same; it is our duty to bear off that burden and labor which hasbeen resting like a mountain upon the leaders of this Church. I know they have groaned under the load thathas rested on them, when they have seen all Israel going to sleep.Let the Twelve Apostles, and theSeventy Apostles, and High PriestApostles, and all other Apostles rise upand keep pace with the work of theLord God, for we have no time to sleep.What is man's life good for, or his words or work good for when he standsin the way of men's salvation, exalta-tion, and glory?  They are of no use at all.As an individual I am determined to wake up and do my duty, God being my helper. I want to see bro-ther Hyde, who is the President of the Twelve, walk into all these Quo-rums and attend their meetings, and we will back him up; I want him to lift up his voice like a trumpet and goto winnowing the wheat; it is for theTwelve to rise up and carry off the load. The Seventies have got to walk up in their place and do their duty. I know God requires this at our hands. The law of God, the holyPriesthood, and the holy anointingand washing, and everything else that is holy requires it at our hands.I know this.It is necessary to reform. The question may be asked, what is the matter? Why, we are asleep; if the 
 148 JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.eyes of any man or woman is opened as they should be, they could see thethings of God as they are in one mo-ment; they would see there is a necessity of waking up and doingsomething. Here is a great and mighty dispensation committedinto the hands of this people for the livingand the dead; the candle of the LordGod is placed in these mountains like a city that is set on a hill thatcannot be hid; the work is on yourshoulders, ye Priests of the MostHigh God!--on you rests the salva-tion of this generation, and the Lord will require this stewardship at your hands.The Lord has given you the keys of the Priesthood with all the bless-ings pertaining to it--as great and asmighty a work as ever was committed to any man on the earth, and that too in the midst of the last dispensation and fulness of times. The Lord re-quires us to prepare this generation, both Jew and Gentile, either for sal-vation or damnation through the proclamation of the Gospel of Jesus Christ and the administering of theordinances of the House of God, and we go to sleep! The Apostles go to sleep--the Seventies go to sleep--the Elders of Israel closetheir eyes to slumber, and we the only people God has on the earth, upon whose shoulders He has laid theresponsibility of performing this great and mighty work!Do you wonder that Prophets get up here and chastise, and draw the sword of justice and hold it over ourheads?  I do not. I wonder that our children at the fireside do not rise up and prophesy, with a voice like thun-der and in flames of fire, unto their fa-thers and mothers, and unto the peopleof Israel. I know that the counsels we have had here through the mouths of the Prophets of God are just and true. I know that the warning voice that has been heard in this Stand, and thecall that has been made on this floor is necessary; and I do hope and prayGod that we, as missionaries, will listen to it. I want my brother mis-sionaries in the first place to wake up,and get aroused with the mantle of salvation and Spirit of God ourselves,and get our own armor bright. It hasbeen justly remarked here that wehave got to labor ourselves until weget the Spirit of God, and then we can walk out among the people andcorrect them; but if we as Seventies,as High Priests, and Apostles, and Elders bearing the Priesthood, if weare resolved to set our hearts upon things of this earth, without being engaged in the interest of the king-dom of God, what can we expect of the people? Not anything. I desire that we may all wake up, and listento the counsel of these men who leadus from day to day.We have no time to lose to prepare ourselves for the things that are com-ing on the earth; and who wants tolose his crown, his glory, and hope of eternal lives that he has had in days past and gone by receiving the Gospelof Jesus Christ?  No man that has any portion of the Spirit of God. Letus rise up and magnify our calling,and labor before God until we can getthe Holy Spirit, and until our prayersrend the vail of eternity and enter into the ears of the God of Sabbaothand be answered in blessings upon our heads.When shall the fire be kindled in Zion?  I do not mean wild fire--there is a true fire, and that is thefire we need to get, that is necessary to kindle; and if we live up to our privileges, do our duty, walk up to the word of the Lord God, and mag-nify our calling, we do know that theblessings of God will attend us, and the sinners in Zion will tremble and fearfulness will surprise the hypocrite;and let what will come, all will beright with the Latter-day Saints. 
 THE PEOPLE ASLEEP, ETC. 149There are great things awaiting usand the world--the Lord is withdraw-ing His Spirit from the nations of theearth, His sword is bathed in heavenand will fall upon Idumea or the world; the seals are about to be opened and the judgments of God poured out upon the wicked, for the cup of their wickedness and abomina-tions is filled to the brim and the indignation of the Lord will be pour-ed out without measure.Let the Saints read the revelationsof God, and they will see that thereare important events at our doors.Let us hearken and wake up, and bedoing the things required of us. Letthe missionaries first get their lamps trimmed and burning, and then go among the people, and go with theSpirit of God and the salvation of theGospel of Jesus Christ; and let the other Quorums do the same; and when you do this you will see a re-form, and sin and iniquity cannot abide in our habitations, in our wards,or in our city.We have sin and sinners among us, and what are we going to do about it?Why, we are going to try to live our religion, and when we do that weshall do right. The business withme is to do right to-day, to live myreligion to-day, and leave the eventswith God; He holds the destinies of the nations and of all men; they arein His hand; He made the earth and controls the children of men upon it.Then let events roll on--if we are only right, all is well. We have got to be tried even unto death. TheLord says He will prove us, and see if we abide in His covenants. Thereis where we have got to stand as a people, not only our horses, and goldand silver, and land and houses, but our lives have got to lie on the altar, and when anything comes to test us,even at the stake of our lives, we should be in the possession of theHoly Ghost not to flee from it, and such will be crowned with the gift ofeternal lives, exaltation and glory.There is nothing to encourage a man to draw back; there is nothingshort of the most damnable principlethat dwells in the spirit of devils thatwould tempt any man to shed the blood of the Lord's anointed, yet men will try to do it. There are men hereto-day who will possess that spirit; I believe it; they are in our city.  Ifthey shed blood they have got the billto pay.  Let the wicked and the un-godly, who will not repent, but fightagainst God, do their worst, their time is short, and the day will come, and that soon when they will be called tojudgment.I remember what Joseph said, a short time before he was slain in oneof the last sermons I ever heard himpreach. Said he, "Men are here to-day who are seeking my blood, andthey are those who have held the Priest-hood and have received their washings and anointings; men who have receivedtheir endowments." I saw the faces ofthose men at that time, and they had a hand in slaying the Prophet. There are men who now possess the samespirit and the same desire. Thereare men here, too, that have faith, that have the Priesthood and the spirit of it, and they will do theirduty, and God will sustain them in it, and He will sustain this Church andkingdom; let the trials of the Saintsbe what they will, the kingdom of God is not to be torn down any moreat all--it will not again be taken from the earth until it is prepared to re-ceive Christ at his coming.Let us prepare ourselves and doour duty, and let the High Priestsand Seventies go to their meetings,and before you go there, go to work and get the Spirit of God, that whenyou get there you may not freeze todeath. And I want to have the peo-ple, when they come here, to get enough of the Spirit of God, that 
 150 JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.when the Presidency rise in this Stand they may give us what is in their hearts. They are filled with blessings for this people. All thetrouble is our eyes have been closed,we have been in a deep sleep; let uswake up and attend to our duty, andmake it the first business we do.Those who lay their plans in secretchambers to seek the blood of theProphets, will have their case attend-ed to by messengers on the other sideof the vail, ministers will be sent tothem who will render unto them a righteous judgment there. I do notwant to preach to them here, but to those who want to be saved.Go to, and if you have not theSpirit of God, make it your first busi-ness to get it, that your minds may beopened to see the things of God as they are; it is your privilege andmine, that we may be prepared forwhat is to come.That this people may repent of alltheir sins and wake up, and have power to come before God that theirprayers may be heard, be prepared todefend the kingdom and never deserttheir covenants and their brethren, orbetray the Gospel, but overcome the world and be prepared to become jointheirs with Christ to the fulness of thefirst resurrection which is prepared for those who keep the command-ments of God, is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 
 INSPIRATION AND TEACHINGS OF THE SPIRIT.Remarks by Elder Wilford Woodruff, made in the Tabernacle, Great Salt Lake City;Sunday Morning, March 22, 1857.When any of the Presidency of this Church, or of the Quorum of the Twelve, or any of the Elders rise in this stand to speak, this people lookunto them, and expect they will enjoy the Holy Spirit sufficiently to say something that will edify them. The people almost unanimously look for this. I will say, on the other hand, that the Presidency, the Twelve, and the Elders who preach in this house expect that the people will have the Spirit of the Lord, that they may come to understanding; and this is just as much required that they may comprehend what is said unto them, as it is required of the breth-ren who speak, to teach doctrine, principle, truth, and the revelations of Jesus Christ. When the minds of the people are quickened and enlight-ened by the power of God and the gift of the Holy Ghost, that they can appreciate and prize the principles of 
 increase and to govern us in our actsamong the children of men. Now,when a man has the Holy Spirit and hears the plain, simple truths of salvation, they appear more valuable than all else besides, and he is ready to sacrifice everything of a temporal nature to secure himself salvation; but when people's minds become darkened,they lose the Holy Spirit and the value of that Gospel, and they do not realize the privilege and the honour of being associated with the Saints of God in these valleys of the mountains,neither do they maintain their alle-giance to their Heavenly Father, and honour his name upon the earth, or prize their association with those that bear the holy Priesthood, and therefore they go into darkness. Why has the word reformation ever been named in Zion? It has been because we did not labour to keep within us that holy principle of life, that our minds might be quickened day by day,and receive and prize those truths delivered unto us. Now we marvel and wonder when we are enlightened by the Spirit of God and the reve-lations which he has given unto us; and when we are aroused to a sense of the importance of these things, wethen see the effect and the bearing they will have upon us,—not only the fitting of our minds to go into the world of spirits, but to prepare us to meet with our Father in heaven.Now, we should live in that way and manner that the Holy Spirit will dwellwith us, and so that we may be pre-pared to receive those truths which are daily delivered unto us by Presi-dents Young, Kimball, Wells, or any other man who rises up here to speakunto us the words of life. We shouldgive attention to what is said. Asbrother Kimball says, the man who speaks to you from this stand is the centre, and we should give him our attention, prayers, and faith; and if we do this we shall receive out of theabundance of his heart those things which will benefit us. It should be our chief study to treasure up the words of life, that we may grow in grace, and advance in the knowledge of God, and become perfected in Christ Jesus, that we may receive a fulness, and become heirs of God and joint heirs with Jesus Christ.The revelations of Jesus Christ teach us that the Saviour was born in the flesh; and the Father said that He did not give him a fulness at first, but continued from grace to grace until he had received a fulness, and was called the Son of God because he did not receive a fulness at first. We in likemanner should seek with all our souls to grow in grace, light, and truth, that in due time we may receive a fulness.The Lord has a great many principlesin store for us; and the greatest principles which he has for us are the most simple and plain. The first principles of the Gospel which lead us unto eternal life are the simplest, and yet none are more glorious or im-portant unto us. Men may labour to make a great display of talent, learn-ing, and knowledge, either in printing or preaching. They may try to preach the mysteries and to present some-thing strange, great, and wonderful,and they may labour for this with all their might, in the spirit and strength of man without the aid of the Holy Spirit of God, and yet the people are not edified, and their preaching will not give much satisfaction. It is the plainest and the most simple things that edify us the most, if taught by the Spirit of God; and there is nothing more important or beneficial unto us.If we have that Spirit dwelling with us—if it abides with us continually, enlightening our minds by day and by night, we are in the safe path; andwhen we have finished the work of the day, we reflect upon it and are satisfied with it, feeling that it is approbated of the Lord. It is our 
 privilege to live in this way, that all our time may be spent so that we have a conscience void of offence towards both God and man. When we reflect on the day that is past and see wherein we have done evil, we should labour to improve and to advance in the things of the kingdom of God. I feel that in order for us to prize the gifts of God, the blessings of the Gospel, the privilege that we have of building tabernacles, and of living here in peace, and kneeling down in our family circles in peace, having in our society the Prophets of God, men filled with wisdom, who are capable of leading us to salvation, and of leading us into the paths of life, who do teach us the principles of truth, which will lead us back to our Father and our God,—I say, when weconsider these things we ought to prize our privileges as Saints of the Most High. Brethren, we must in-variably have the Spirit of God with us, that we may ever be kept in the line of our duty.I feel to exhort you in regard to these things, that we may prize those blessings which God has given unto us, and pursue a course wherein we may be justified of the Lord. Now, if we attempt to do anything that is not right, the Spirit of the Lord will not approbate us, but we shall feelcondemned. The Lord has blessed us during the past winter; He has poured out upon us a great amount of knowledge, wisdom, and treasures,that we ought to prize. Now, as the spring is coming upon us, and as we turn our attention to the plough and to cultivating the earth, if we forget our prayers, the Devil will take double the advantage of us. We have re-newed our covenants by baptism, and we have received great blessings fromthe Lord, and much of the Holy Spirit has been shed abroad among this people. And, as brother Richards has said—and I consider the counselright—we should not only reprove our-selves when wrong, but we should reprove sin wherever we see it, whether in ourselves, in our streets, or in our quorums. We should always show our disapprobation of those that are wrong—that are sinful and wicked.I do not feel, this morning, like occupying a great portion of your time,but I do feel that the Lord is gracious unto us, and that we should prize above all things upon the earth the words of eternal life that are given unto us. As long as we are governed by the Holy Spirit, our minds are strengthened, and our faith is and will be increased, and we shall la-bour for the building up of the king-dom of God. And I pray that our hearts may be inspired to magnify our calling and the holy Priesthood,and honour God, keep his command-ments, and live our religion, which I ask in the name of Jesus Christ.Amen. 
 Bro Wilford Woodruff said Bro Snow hasgiven us good counsel this morning We should take a course to save ourselves to day. TheLord has said he would "prove us in all things" ##Doctrine & Covenants 98:14##We have taken many Lessons for the past25 years. we should make up our minds to makethe best use of the Lessons we are able to We have a Years War, but it has been aBloodless Wone. Prest Buchanan nor Congress does not know us. I believe thatDevil is a Christian & goes hand in hand withall Christendom, he is a Gentleman—They wouldput Jesus Christ or any of the old Prophets or apostlesto death if they were here, as they did ancientlyWe have confidence in God & we know he isour friend & that he has sustained usWe have not violated the Laws of God or manThey are mad at us because we believe thatJoseph Smith was a Prophet & that B. Youngis his Successor. 
 The Army would have been swept out of existencehad it not been for those who lead this peoplethey are dictated by God, he rules all things forthe good of Zion & will do it – Let us make thebest use of the circumstances that surround usWe should learn to be wise be prudent in allthings. We took a vote a few months ago toburn our houses & cut down our fruit treesrather than have officers forced upon us contraryto our wishes. We intend to do so yetbut do not apostatize if you have to go backfor the Lord may accept of our offering (i.e)take the will for the deed. I think it wouldbe well for us to have Sutlers to trade with theSoldiers for they have Sutlers to trade for themYou may just as well have confidence with Godif we please If we sell to our enemies let menbe appointed to trade with them—not evry one berunning to them & thereby get into a row with themNo one should be running to them for they areafraid of being contaminated &by us & we are afraid being contaminated by them so we areagreed in this one thing. The Lord has a little morepower than the Devil. Let us make the best useof the power that God has given us. We havebore oppression many times & now we arecall'd upon to sustain the Constitution of theU. S. we have done it & calculate to do itNo one to have any fears of the Mormons for weare in the mountains & we can take care of ourselvesbut they should have fear for themselves for the judgements of God will soon be upon themThe cry is now Peace, Peace but we do not knowwhether that army is going in to winter quartersthen it will do to talk about going back. But letus not be to hasty. when our Leaders go back & say tous Come back, then all right - Amen 
 Sunday Oct 17 [18]58 2 oclockBro Wilford Woodruff After so long a silenceI feel glad to speak to you how much I shallsay I know not the Question has often been askewhen shall we have any more Preaching. There hasbeen silence in gt S L City the voice of the Prophethas not been heard of late Truth is Truth to day & willbe tomorrow the same Principles of Salvation remainthe same in every age. if you or I ever saw any beautyin the gosple there is yet the same beauty yet, becauseof this Silence it is no reason that we should notlive our religion those who wached over us once arestill watching over us, we should Sow the Truth inall Sircumstances we are placed, there now seemsto be now a sifting time there has been a strong infl-uance to Draw away men from the truth. godhas revealed the fullness of the gosple by an angel: thegreater the light the greater are our responsibilities therehas never been a generation greater Priviledged thanyou this is a Dispensation of Dispensations god hasthrough Prophet that he would restore again the gosplethis is the same Holy Prieshood conferred upon Adamand the Ancients. This was not revealed to our fathersnow because we have been placed in surcimstances shallwe partake of them such as gold and silver. great isour condemnation if we turn away we profess to have recieved a Dispensation of the Holy gosplewe have now. Preached to allmost every Nation underheaven, & now shall we now turn away. I hope notthough I often hear of some turn away. Well everyman has he has his Agency yet god holds every manns responsable. not man ought leave the commandments of God.  it seems to me that this Churchis making great progress, has much the last 6 monthshas it has any 6 months.  Did putting the Prophets ofgod in chains &c stop this work no it only helped 
 FULFILMENT OF PROPHECY—POWER OF THE GOSPEL—CONSISTENCY OF ITS PRINCIPLES.Discourse by Elder WILFORD WOODRUFF, delivered in the Bowery, GreatSalt Lake City, July 27, 1862.REPORTED BY J. V. LONG.Brother Taylor gave us a veryinteresting discourse this morningupon the first principles of the Gospel,contrasting them with the religionof the Christian world, showing theauthority by which they administeredin different ages the ordinances ofreligion according to the traditionsof their fathers. He remarked thatthe Elders of this Church went forthas the Apostles did in the days of the Savior, promising to the people,on conditions of obedience, the gift ofthe Holy Ghost; and he remarkedthat no other people would do that,because they do not possess theauthority to do it.I do not know that I can spendthe few moments that I may speakhere, better than to read a little onthe authority that we have for pur-suing this course. This portion that

 I am going to read, is the word ofthe Lord to the Church of JesusChrist of Latter-day Saints, as wellas to the whole world:"Hearken, O ye people of mychurch, saith the voice of Him whodwells on high, and whose eyes areupon all men; yea, verily I say,hearken ye people from afar, and yethat are upon the islands of thesea, listen together; for verily thevoice of the Lord is unto all men,and there is none to escape, and thereis no eye that shall not see, neitherear that shall not hear, neither heartthat shall not be penetrated: and therebellious shall be pierced with muchsorrow, for their iniquities shall bespoken upon the housetops, and theirsecret acts shall be revealed; and thevoice of warning shall be unto allpeople, by the mouths of my dis-ciples, whom I have chosen in theselast days, and they shall go forth andnone shall stay them, for I the Lordhave commanded them."Behold, this is mine authority,and the authority of my servants, andmy preface unto the book of mycommandments, which I have giventhem to publish unto you, O inhabi-tants of the earth: wherefore, fearand tremble, O ye people, for what Ithe Lord have decreed in them shall be fulfilled. And verily, I say untoyou, that they who go forth, bearingthese tidings unto the inhabitants ofthe earth, to them is power given toseal both on earth and in heaven, theunbelieving and rebellious; yea, verily,to seal them up unto the day when thewrath of God shall be poured outupon the wicked without measure;unto the day when the Lord shallcome to recompense unto every manaccording to his work, and measureto every man according to the mea-sure which he has measured to hisfellow-man."Wherefore the voice of the Lordis unto the end of the earth, that allthat will hear may hear: prepare ye,prepare ye for that which is to come,for the Lord is nigh; and the angerof the Lord is kindled, and his swordis bathed in heaven, and it shall fallupon the inhabitants of the earth;and the arm of the Lord shall berevealed. And the day cometh thatthey who will not hear the voice ofthe Lord, neither the voice of hisservants, neither give heed to thewords of the Prophets and Apostles,shall be cut off from among the people;for they have strayed from mine ordi-nances, and they have broken mineeverlasting covenant; they seek notthe Lord, to establish his righteous-ness, but every man walketh in his own way, and after the image of hisown god, whose image is in thelikeness of the world, and whose sub-stance is that of an idol, which waxethold and shall perish in Babylon, even Babylon the great, which shall fall."Wherefore I, the Lord, knowingthe calamity which should come uponthe inhabitants of the earth, calledupon my servant Joseph Smith, jun.,and spake unto him from heaven,and gave him commandments; andalso gave commandments to others,that they should proclaim these thingsunto the world; and all this that itmight be fulfilled, which was writtenby the Prophets; the weak things ofthe world shall come forth and breakdown the mighty and strong ones;that man should not counsel hisfellow-man, neither trust in the armof flesh, but that every man mightspeak in the name of God the Lord,even the Savior of the world; thatfaith also might increase in the earth;that mine everlasting covenant mightbe established; that the fulness of myGospel might be proclaimed by theweak and the simple unto the endsof the world, and before kings andrulers."Behold, I am God and have 
 spoken it: these commandments areof me, and were given unto myservants in their weakness, after themanner of their language, that theymight come to understanding, andinasmuch as they erred it might bemade known: and inasmuch as theysought wisdom they might be in-structed; and inasmuch as theysinned they might be chastened, thatthey might repent: and inasmuch asthey were humble they might be madestrong, and blessed from on high, andreceive knowledge from time to time:and after having received the recordof the Nephites, yea, even my servantJoseph Smith, jun., might have powerto translate through the mercy ofGod, by the power of God, the Bookof Mormon; and also those to whom these commandments were given,might have power to lay the founda-tion of this church, and to bring itforth out of obscurity and out ofdarkness, the only true and livingchurch upon the face of the wholeearth, with which I, the Lord, amwell pleased, speaking unto the church collectively and not individu-ally, for I, the Lord, cannot look uponsin with the least degree of allowance;nevertheless, he that repents and doesthe commandments of the Lord shallbe forgiven; and he that repents not,from him shall be taken even thelight which he has received, for mySpirit shall not always strive withman, saith the Lord of Hosts."And again, verily I say unto you,O inhabitants of the earth, I theLord am willing to make these thingsknown unto all flesh, for I am norespecter of persons, and will that allmen shall know that the day speedilycometh; the hour is not yet, but isnigh at hand, when peace shall betaken from the earth, and the devilshall have power over his own domi-nion, and also the Lord shall havepower over his Saints, and shall reignin their midst, and shall come downin judgment upon Idumea, or theworld."Search these commandments, forthey are true and faithful, and theprophecies and promises which are inthem shall all be fulfilled."What I, the Lord, have spoken, Ihave spoken, and I excuse not myself:and though the heavens and the earthpass away, my word shall not passaway, but all shall be fulfilled,whether by mine own voice or by thevoice of my servants, it is the same;for behold and lo, the Lord is God,and the Spirit bearth record, andthe record is true, and the truthabideth forever and ever. Amen."—-[See ##Doctrine and Covenants 1:34-39|Doc. & Cov., pages 65-68.##]-What do you think of that revela-tion, brethren? Does this look likea Yankee scheme, or something madeup to cheat somebody? No, this isthe word of the Lord; it is a sermonof itself. The Lord has sustainedthat revelation from that day to thepresent, and that is the reason whybrother Taylor and the Elders of thisChurch go forth declaring the wordsof life, and they know that they havenot taken this honor upon them-selves, but that they were called ofGod as was Aaron. [##Hebrews 5:4##] I do not care howilliterate an Elder in this Church is,if he has been faithful to his calling;it is a matter I care but little aboutif a man can neither read nor write, ifhe has been called and ordained to thePriesthood in this Church and king-dom by Joseph Smith, or any of thoseordained by him to that Priesthoodwhich was given unto the Prophet byPeter, James and John, who by com-mandment came and ordained him to the Melchisedec Priesthood. [##Doctrine and Covenants 128:20##] John theBaptist held the Aaronic Priesthood,and the authority commenced there,and by those men that held the keysof the kingdom of God in former dis-pensations. It is that authority thathas inspired this; it is this that hasinspired the Elders of Israel from

God Never had a peopleBut he answered their Prayers let us not forsake godwe have waged war against sin & iniquity this[maf one will muct] us some day. We may have tolay down our lives. To lay down our lives for thisKingdom only sweetens our life. This a comfort to us[are] long Zion will return & Build up the [maste plan] 
 the commencement to the presentday.Why should the Elders and peoplenow think it strange that those mes-sengers who have gone forth, shoulder-ing their knapsacks and travellingthousands of miles to preach theGospel, should be the especial objectsof his favor? The Almighty hasproven them all the day long, and hehas been with them, and in fact therehas never been any portion of thePriesthood officiating in sacred ordi-nances but God has been with them.In this revelation the Lord calls uponhis servants, and says, "I, the Lord,am willing to make this known tothe children of men, that I have calledmy servant Joseph, that the worldmay be left without excuse."Joseph Smith knew just as well asthe Lord knew that he was called ofGod, and that he was called to per-form a work for the redemption ofman. Has he ever disappointed any-body when he has made a promiseto them? Has he ever disappointeda Prophet or lawgiver in any age ofthe world? No, never. But he hasdeclared that the heavens and theearth shall pass away, but his wordshall never pass away, but that itshall all be fulfilled. It is just so inour day. All the words which theLord has spoken through his servantswill be fulfilled to the very letter,whether those words are in referenceto the salvation of the righteous orthe condemnation of the wicked.Christ had his mind upon this pointwhen he said, "Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shallnot pass away."—##Matthew 24:35|Matthew xxiv, 35.##Again, it is written, "For I willhasten my word to perform it;" [##Jeremiah 1:12##] andwhen the Lord spake through Isaiahupon this subject he said. "So shallmy word be that goeth forth out ofmy mouth: it shall not return untome void, but it shall accomplish thatwhich I please, and it shall prosper inthe thing whereto I sent it." [##Isaiah 55:11##] TheElders go forth to preach the Gospelto the nations of the earth, knowingthat the Lord will back up their wordby the power and demonstration ofthe Holy Ghost.There is but one Gospel, neitherwill there be any other for the salva-tion of this, nor of any other worldthat we know of; but this we doknow that this Gospel preached inany age of the world will produce thesame effect. We also know that anyman who receives this Priesthood,and is faithful thereunto, will receivethe same blessings and power in anyand every age of the world. On thisaccount and for this reason, Utah—the valleys of Deseret are being filledwith the children of men. TheAlmighty has sent his servants topreach the Gospel; they have not goneupon their own authority: had theydone so, they might have called uponthe inhabitants of the earth till dooms-day, and they would not have been suc-cessful, but this land would still havebeen a desert, occupied only byIndians and wild beasts. But thehand of God was with us, and hencewe had no fear of telling the peopleour message, and now there are tensof thousands who know the truth aswell as we do, for they have embracedthe Gospel and received this testimonyfor themselves. There never was aman that embraced this Gospel, buthas received this testimony of thetruth, if he has done so in sincerityand in truth. The Lord has alwaysbeen ready to redeem his promise,and in giving that testimony whichwas necessary for the establishing ofthem in the most holy faith.The Lord has sustained us as apeople in all places and under all cir-cumstances. We have gone forth assheep among wolves; among a peoplefull of tradition and superstition, andwe have had all these things to copewith in our administrations among 
 the people, but the Lord was with uswherever we went, backing up our words by the testimony and power ofthe Holy Ghost, and the people towhom we administered received thesame testimony as had been givenunto us.We are beginning to realize thatthe things which the Lord has pro-mised unto us thirty years ago arenow being fulfilled to the very letter.Is there much peace in the world ofmankind? No, there is not: peaceis fast being taken from the childrenof men. We are at peace in Utah,but let me tell you that the Lord hasforetold by the revelations of JesusChrist all these things that are nowfulfilling before our eyes.I copied a revelation more thantwenty-five years ago, in which it isstated that war should be in the southand in the north, and that nationafter nation would become embroiledin the tumult and excitement, untilwar should be poured out upon the whole earth, and that this war wouldcommence at the rebellion of SouthCarolina, and that times should besuch that every man who did not flee to Zion would have to take up thesword against his neighbor or againsthis brother. These things are begin-ning to be made manifest, but the endis not yet; but it will come, and thattoo much sooner than the world ofmankind anticipate, and all thosethings spoken by the mouths of hisProphets will be fulfilled.We are gathering together here forcertain purposes understood and inthe mind of the Lord, one of which isthat we may be sanctified and pre-pared for the great work of the future.We have carried this work to the various nations of the earth, and thepeople to whom we have preachedhave thought of us saying that therewas no other Gospel than that whichwe had to proclaim, as was clearly and demonstratively set forth to-day. TheGospel of Jesus Christ is perfect inall its parts. The words of thePsalmist David will apply to ourreligion, where he says:—"The lawof the Lord is perfect, converting thesoul: the testimony of the Lord issure, making wise the simple. The statutes of the Lord are right, rejoic-ing the heart: the commandment ofthe Lord is pure, enlightening theeyes. The fear of the Lord is clean,enduring for ever: the judgments ofthe Lord are true and righteousaltogether. More to be desired arethey than gold, yea, than much finegold: sweeter also than honey andthe honeycomb." [##Psalm 19:7-10##]According to the vision of Johnthe Revelator, there are to be "sixhundred, threescore and six" [##Revelation 13:18##] falsesects of religion: how many of thesealready exist is a matter of disputeamong theologists, but I suppose thatthe number is nearly complete. Letme now ask if you think things lookor indicate that these contendingcreeds are all of God. It is certainlynot like the order carried out in the days of Christ and his Apostles. Itis much more like the confusion ofthe Pharisees, Essenes, Herodians,Sadducees and Stoics, for they haddifferent creeds, principles and notionsby which they were governed, and itis just so now with the sectarianworld. It is composed of every sectand party that profess religion uponthe face of the earth. But the honestin heart will be gathered out of allthese creeds and systems and bebrought home to Zion.There have been thousands of menand women who have listened to thepreaching of the Elders of thisChurch, who have not embraced itfor fear of their good name; andthere have been many clergymen whohave listened attentively to the Eldersof Israel, and they have spent daysand nights in meditating upon thethings of God, and studying what to 
 do, realizing within themselves thatif they received this testimony theywould be dishonored in the eyes ofthe world. They fear becoming ahiss and a by-word among the childrenof men in this generation. Hence themajority of them have rejected it.Many celebrated men have investi-gated this subject, and far more ofthem have had fears that it was truethan that it was false. I visited folksin Long Island in 1837; I talkedwith one minister named Newton, infact I stayed with him some twelvedays and preached the Gospel to him.He attended meetings, and finallybecame so that he could neither eat,drink, nor sleep, he was so troubledabout the Gospel; but instead of em-bracing it, sent after a minister wholived on the south side of the island,for the purpose of having me putdown or silenced. I persevered andsoon baptized most of the members ofMr. Newton's church. Mr. Douglass,a Methodist minister of the south sideof the island came, stayed a shorttime and then returned. I followedhim home and succeeded in baptizingmost of his church; and instead ofthese men getting any honor byopposing me they were both broughtinto disgrace. They lost their religion,their church and members, and werereally disgraced. When I was therelast, one of them was in the Peni-tentiary for one of the worst crimesthat a man can be guilty of, exceptmurder, and the other was travellingthe streets peddling small articles forhis bread. The chastening hand ofthe Lord will always follow thosethat oppose the truth of Heaven asrevealed through the Prophet of God.This is in accordance with the experi-ence of all our Elders. The HolyGhost has been with them to back uptheir words, and I can say for all that,we have not done a thing but it hasbeen backed up by the power of theAlmighty, so far as we have laboredfor the upbuilding of the kingdom ofGod.In regard to holding office in thePriesthood, I can truly say that Inever asked any man for any office inthis Church, and I believe I neverasked the Lord but once, and myasking the Lord came about in thisway. I went up to Missouri in Zion'scamp; I saw the Prophet every day,and I knew he was a Prophet of God.About this time I had a great anxietyto preach the Gospel; this desireincreased upon me, and I finallyresolved to ask the Lord to open myway, so I went down into a hickorygrove and prayed, during which Iasked him to give me the privilege topreach the Gospel. I prayed ferventlyto the Almighty to give me the privi-lege of preaching the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and when I got through prayingI started for the place from whence Icame, and I had not walked morethan about forty rods before I met aHigh Priest, and the first thing hesaid to me was, "It is the will of theLord that you go and preach theGospel." I told him I was readyand willing to do anything the Lordrequired of me; I was thereforeordained a Priest and sent to laborin Arkansas.I will now name a circumstancewhich I have never named in publicbefore. I went into Arkansas, travel-led a hundred miles out of my wayto see a man that had embraced theGospel some time before I went there.He was full of wrath and indignationwhen I went in; he railed againstJoseph Smith, Bishop Partridge andFather Morley. The Lord showedme the night before that I hadenemies in that town. I talked overmy feelings with the brother whoaccompanied me, and he wanted toleave the town, but I said no, I wouldnot go away, for I wanted to see whatthe Lord wanted of me. All thepeople were mad with rage, and we 
 could not get anybody to preach to;in fact they were all full of rage tillthey were mad with it. For sometime I could not see my way clearly,but we finally called upon an old mannamed Hubbard, and engaged to goand clear timber. During the shorttime that we were employed at thatthe Lord sent me three times to visitthat old apostate, and each time whenI went there I could only bear testi-mony to him of the truth of theGospel. When I went the third timehe followed me out of the house asfull of wrath as the Devil, and he hadnot followed me more than abouteight rods when he fell dead at myfeet. This is a short story and a verysingular one.At that time I had not power tolay on hands for the gift of the HolyGhost, only holding the AaronicPriesthood, but the Lord sustainedme and his work just as well as if Ihad been an Apostle. We baptizedfather Hubbard and his wife, afterwhich we went on our way rejoicing.The Lord has fed and sustained hisservants, and manifested his poweraccording to circumstances, and so hewill continue to do through life to allthat are faithful and true to theircovenants.When the United States sent anarmy to this land for our destruction,the Lord had his eye upon us forgood and he delivered us from all ourenemies. The wicked have designedour destruction from the first organi-zation of this Church and kingdom,but our leaders have been inspired bythe gift and power of God. Whofrustrated that army in their design?The Lord our God; and now thejudgments that have come upon thenation in consequence of their treat-ment to this people, are a sore vexa-tion to them, but it is the hand-dealingof the Almighty and we cannot helpit. Every Elder in this Church wholives his religion knows that thiswhich is now transpiring is accordingto the mind and forshadowings of theHoly Spirit, and those out of theChurch may know if they will. Ifpersons will believe the Bible, theBook of Doctrines and Covenants,and the Book of Mormon, they cantherein learn the fate of the world,for it is there pointed out in greatplainness. Who can stay this warthat is devastating the whole nationboth North and South? No humanhand; it is out of the power ofman, excepting by the repentanceof the whole nation, for they haveshed the blood of the Prophets, driventhis Church and people from theirmidst, yes, the very people that holdthe keys of salvation for the worldthey have banished from their midst,they have turned those keys that willseal their condemnation, and for thisthe Lord our God has taken peaceout of their midst. Will there everbe any more peace among them?No, not until the earth is drenchedwith the blood of the inhabitantsthereof. When the spirit of theGospel leaves any people it leavesthem in a worse condition than itfound them, the spirit of ferocity,darkness and war will take holdof that people, and the time willcome when every man that does nottake his sword against his neighborwill have to go to Zion for safety.These things sound strange in theears of our neighbors of the nationwith which we are connected, but letme tell you they are strictly true.Remember Christ's words in regard tothe temple, viz., "There shall notbe left here one stone upon anotherthat shall not be thrown down."—##Matthew 24:2|Matthew xxiv., 2.## The Lord JesusChrist is as truthful now as he wasthen, and no power can stay his hand.Have we any fears of the conse-quences of what will transpire? No,we have not, for we know that God isat the helm. 
 When this kingdom commenced itwas like a mustard seed, very small,but the Lord has sustained it and hewill continue to control it to the endof time. Although peace is beingtaken from the earth yet this kingdomwill thrive and prosper until everykingdom and government shall bebroken to pieces, and every powershall be subject to the God of heaven.Here are Elders who are faithfuland true who have preached theGospel from Maine to Texas, andfrom the Atlantic to California, andthe warning voice has been lifted inEurope and in the Islands of the Sea,and thousands have embraced it andbeen made to rejoice in the truth.We know that this work is of God,and that it will roll forth and prosperthough all the world oppose. Waris only one of the troubles that theUnited States are going to receive;and I can further testify, that there isno nation that will escape the judg-ments of the Almighty. There is noear but what has to be penetratedwith the sound of the Gospel ofChrist; and by-and-by the Elders ofIsrael will be taken from thosenations where they are now preaching,and there will be another set of Mis-sionaries sent amongst the people;there will be the voice of lightning,the noise of war, and of all those judg-ments which have been enumeratedand prophesied of since the begin-ning of time, and they will go forthamong the nations until the land iscleansed from the abominations thatnow reign upon the face of the earth.When this Gospel was first pro-claimed to the world, darkness coveredthe earth; and wherever this doctrineis preached by those having authorityand it is rejected, that people becomemore dark than they were before,and go blindly along like the oxto the slaughter, and they will sooneror later be overtaken by the judg-ments of the Almighty.This is the nature of our testimony,brethren and sisters, we know thatthis work is true; we also know thatJoseph Smith was a Prophet of God,and the Bible could not have beenfulfilled unless the Lord had raisedup Prophets to declare the everlastingGospel unto the children of men; henever could have brought his judg-ments upon the nations until he hadraised up those Prophets who wereordained to come and warn the world.The Lord is now doing this work ofwarning, first by his servants andthen by his judgments. In speakingof the kingdom of God I will hereremark, that it is always alike, or inother words it is always governedby the same laws, by Apostles andProphets, and you cannot have a Church of Christ without these officers;there never was such a church sincethe beginning of the world. If anyperson will show me a people thatwere acknowledged of God, who didnot have Prophets to lead them, Iwill confess that to be somethingwhich I have not found.Paul says, speaking of the Churchof Christ, "And he gave someApostles, and some Prophets, andsome Evangelists, and some Pastorsand Teachers." [##Ephesians 4:11##] Then, in another partof the writings of the same Apostle,he shows that with such an organiza-tion one part cannot say to the other"I have no need of thee," [##1 Corinthians 12:21##] but that allare necessary in the Church of Christ.It is just so with the gifts and gracesof the Gospel. A great many of youhave seen men without some of theirlimbs, and just as quick as I come toa man who has lost an arm I see it.I remember once seeing a man inLondon without any legs, draggingalong as best he could, and of courseit was very inconvenient for him totravel; but I will tell you one thingwhich I never did see, I never sawany man going around without anyhead. A man can live without arms 
 or without legs, but he cannotwithout a head, and it is precisely sowith the Church of Christ; one isjust as impossible as the other. Noother order has been manifested inthis our day. We have a Prophetto lead and govern this people; wealso have pastors and teachers, theHoly Ghost and the revelations ofJesus Christ right from heaven untous, and we are realizing every daythe fulfilment of these things that arepromised to the faithful.Brethren and sisters, we ought tobe truly thankful to our Father andGod, for he has been merciful to us,he has bestowed upon us his Spirit sothat our ears have been opened tohear and our hearts to understandand to rejoice in the good things ofthe kingdom of God. And howlamentable it is that so few in thepresent generation have embracedthe fulness of the Gospel, perhaps notone in ten thousand have received thetruth. The Jews have suffered longand grievously for their rebellion, andthey will continue to suffer for sometime yet, but woe unto the Gentileswhen they reject the light that isoffered, for when that stone, which isspoken of in Scripture, falls upon them they cannot escape the crushing power thereof, it will grind them topowder.Let us be faithful, serve our Godand trust in him, and then, throughthe influence of his Spirit we shallknow the signs of the times, and beprepared and made meet for ourMaster's use.I ask that this may be our portion,in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 
 COMPREHENSIVENESS OF THE LATTER-DAY WORK.  77REMARKS BY ELDER WILFORD WOODRUFF,DELIVERED IN THE NEW TABERNACLE, SALT LAKE CITY,APRIL 8, 1872.(Reported by David W. Evans.)COMPREHENSIVENESS OF THE LATTER-DAY WORK.We have had a very good Confer-ence; we have heard a great deal of testimony from the servants of the Lord, and that testimony has been true. The building up of the Zionof God in these latter days includes, I may say of a truth, every branch of business, both temporal and spiritual, in which we are engaged.We can not touch upon any subject which is lawful in the sight of God and man, that is not embraced in our religion. The Gospel of Jesus Christ which we have embraced, and whichwe preach, includes all truth, and every lawful calling and occupation of man. One subject that we are deeply interested in I wish to say a few words upon. In the first placeI wish to give notice in this stage of my remarks to the members of the Deseret Agricultural and Manufac-turing Society, that they are re-quested to meet, at the close of this meeting, at the Historian's Office, to appoint their president and board of directors for the coming season, for the times demand that we should hold a State fair in this city this fall.Strangers may think this a very strange subject to present in a reli-gious meeting, but we are building up the literal kingdom of God on the earth, and we have temporal duties to perform. We inhabit temporal bodies, we eat temporal food, we build temporal houses, we raise tem-poral cattle and temporal wheat; we contend with temporal weeds, andwith temporal enemies in our soil,and these things naturally give rise to the necesssity of attending to and performing many duties of a tempo-ral and arduous nature, and they, of course, are embraced in our reli-gion. In building up the Zion and kingdom of God in these latter days,our agricultural and manufacturing interests are of the most vital im-portance; in fact manufacturing and agricultural pursuits are of vitalimportance to any nation under hea-ven. Show me a nation whose peoplecultivate the earth, and manufacture what they need, and I will show you a rich and independent nation.Show me a nation that lives entirely by mining and I will show you a poor nation—one that is ready to run out and become obsolete. You see this manifest in the history of all nations under heaven. What gives England her wealth to-day? Her coal, iron, and the products of her soil, in connection with her prodigious manufactures; and it is so with allthe nations of the earth. What makes the United States what she is to-day? Her products and the cul-tivation of her soil, and the constant efforts she has made to supply the wants of her people. Not but what 
 78  JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.mining is all right, there is no fault with the development of the re-sources of the earth under favorable circumstances. When we came here our position demanded that the very first thing we did was to plant our potatoes and sow our wheat, or we had starvation before us; and I will here say that the Saints and the El-ders of Israel have gone before the Lord day after day and week after week, and prayed the Almighty to hide up the treasures of these moun-tains, lest even the Latter-day Saints, with all the faith they had, should be tempted to turn away from the culti-vation of the earth and the manu-facture of what they needed; and the Lord heard our prayers, and we dwelt here many years and filled these valleys for six hundred mileswith cities, towns, villages, gardens,orchards, fields, vineyards, hundreds of school-houses, and places of wor-ship, until we made the desert blos-som as the rose, and had a supply of wheat, bread and clothing upon our hands. Then, I do not know but the Elders ceased praying for the Lord to hide up the treasures of the earth —I guess they did, for very soon after mines began to be opened, and now silver mines are being worked in many parts of the Territory. A fewyears ago General Connor and others, who dwelt here, with soldiers under them, spent very many days in prospecting these mountains from one end to the other for gold and silver,but they could find none; to-day you may go over the same places, and if you dig into the earth you may find plenty of silver, and you may find it almost anywhere in these mountains.I suppose this is all right, I have no fault to find with it; but I still say that the interest of the Latter-day Saints in these mountains is to culti-vate the soil and to manufacture what [t]hey use.Through the influence of President Young we have many manufactories for wool and cotton already estab-lished in this Territory.  He has done more than any man living in these last days, according to the means he has had at his command, to establish these branches of busi-ness in the midst of these mountains.We have now many large factories in this Territory that have to stand stillfor want of wool. I want to say a few words on this subject to the wool growers of Deseret.  Instead of sending our wool out of the Territory, to eastern States to be manufactured into cloth, and purchasing it and paying eastern manufacturers a large per centage for it when brought here by railroad, I feel that it is our duty, and it would be far wiser for us, to sell our wool to those who own fac-tories in this Territory, and to sustain ourselves by sustaining home manu-factures.One of the first commands given to Adam, after being placed in Eden,was to dress the garden; and he was permitted to eat of the fruit of every tree except one.  After a while Adamand his wife, Eve, partook of the fruit of this tree, and the history of the Fall is before us and the world.After Adam was cast out of the gar-den the Lord told him that there should be a curse on the earth, and instead of bringing forth beautiful flowers, fruit and grain spontaneously, as before the Fall, it should bring forth thorns, briers, thistles and noxious weeds, and that man shouldearn his bread by the sweat of his brow; and from that time to the present mankind has had this curseto contend with in the cultivation of the earth. In consequence of this the inhabitants of Utah, in theiragricultural operations have to fight against the cockle burr, the black seed and sunflower, as well as thorns 
 COMPREHENSIVENESS OF THE LATTER-DAY WORK.  79and thistles and many other noxious weeds, which, if not eradicated, speedily take advantage of us, and to a great extent, mar the result of our labors. It will pay us to pay attention to these things; it will pay us to dress the earth, to till it, to take care of and spend time and means in manuring and feeding it; it will pay us to gather out these noxious weeds, for the earth will then have a chance to bring forth in its strength. This, with the blessing of God upon our labors, has made the soil of Utah as productive as it is to-day.  I wish to see this interest increase in our midst; and I hope, in addition to this, that those who are raising sheep—our wool growers— will pay attention to and carry on that branch of business systemati-cally, and that we will sell our wool to those who manufacture it at home, instead of sending it out of the Territory to be manufactured. I feel that this is our duty, and the course which will promote our best interests,and it is a principle which is true, independent of religion, in any com-munity or nation; it is a self-sus-taining principle.God has blessed us, he has blessed the earth, and our labors in the tilling of the soil have been greatly pros-pered. As has been said by some of our brethren in their remarks, when the pioneers came here, no mark of civilization or of the white man, wasfound. If those who are now so anxious to obtain the homes we have made, had seen Utah as we saw it,they would never have desired a habitation here, but they would have got out of it as soon as they could.It was barren, desolate, abounding with grasshoppers, crickets and kiotewolves, and these things seemed to be the only natural production ofthe soil. We went to work by faith,not much by sight, to cultivate the earth. We broke almost all the plows we had the first day. We had to let streams of water out to moistenthe earth, and by experience we had to learn to raise anything. The stranger comes into Salt Lake Cityand sees our orchards, and the treesin our streets, and he thinks, what a fruitful and delightful place it is.He does not think that, for twenty or twenty-four years, almost every tree he beholds, according to its age,has had to be watered twice a weekthrough the whole summer season, or they would all have been dead long since. We have had to unite upon these things, the Lord has blessed our labors, and his mercies have been over this people.If we had not cultivated the earth, but had turned our attention to min-ing, we should not only have starvedto death ourselves, but thousands of strangers, who have passed through, would have shared the same fate.Utah Territory has been the great highway to California, Nevada, and all the western States and Territories,and they have all looked, in a mea-sure, to Utah for their bread. No-body but Latter-day Saints would have lived here, and endured the trials and affllictions that we endured in the beginning; none others would have stayed and fought the crickets one year, as we had to do year after year. Any people but the Latter-day Saints would have left this coun-try long ago. Not only so, on account of the things I have already named, but I will here say that no other people could have lived here—no, they would have knocked each others' brains out on account of the little water they would have had in their irrigating operations. Whenmen saw their crops and trees wither-ing and perishing for the want of water, the selfishness so general in the world would have worked up to 
 80  JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.such an extent, that they would have killed one another, and hence I say that none but Latter-day Saints would have stood it; but they, by the training and experience they had before received, were prepared for the hardships and trials they had to encounter in this country.Brethren and sisters, let us con-tinue our efforts in cultivating the earth, and in the manufacturing what we want. And I still urge upon our Female Relief Societies, in this city and throughout the Territory, to carry out the counsel PresidentYoung gave us years and years ago, and try, as far as possible, within ourselves, to make our own bonnets, hats and clothing, and to let the beauty of what we wear be the work-manship of our own hands. It is true that our religion is not in our coat or bonnet, or it should not be.If a man's religion is there it is not generally very deep anywhere else. But God has blessed us with the products of earth and the bles-sings of heaven, and his Spirit has been with us; we have been pre-served, and the Lord has turned away the edge of the sword, and he has protected us during many years past and gone, and we all have to acknowledge his hand in these things.I do not wish to detain this Con-ference. I felt as though I wanted to make a few remarks on these sub-jects. I hope, brethren, that we will not slacken our hands with regard to the cultivation of the earth. In the prosecution of our labors in that respect we have every-thing to contend with that man has been cursed with for five thousand years. We should clean our fields, as far as we can, of the noxious weeds, and our streets of sunflowers.These things encumber the earth.  We have one difficulty to contend with, unknown save in those por-tions of the earth where irrigation is practiced.  It is true that a man may clean his fields of sunflowers,cockle burrs, blackseed and every other noxious weed that grows, and the very first time he waters his land here will come a peck or a bushel of foul seed from the mountains, and fill every field through which the stream flows. These difficulties we have to fight against, but we must do the best we can. As farmers, we should clean our seed, and not sow the foul along with the good.One man, in a few hours, with a good wire sieve, can sift enough seed for ten acres of land, and perhaps for twenty; while, to pull that bad seed out when grown will cost from one to five hundred dollars, for it will take a score of men days to do it. We should use our time, judg-ment and the wisdom God has given us to the best advantage in all these things.I want the brethren to come toge-ther this afternoon and elect their officers, for we desire to hold a fair this fall, in which the agriculturaland manufacturing interests of the Territory may be represented aud interested. Let us not be weary in well doing; let us not slacken our hands, either in cultivating the earth or in the manufacturing of what we need. Co-operate in agricultural and mercantile matters, also in our tanneries, and in the making of butter and cheese. One man may engage in these branches of busi-ness with advantage if he have skilland experience to guide him; but in co-operation the wisdom of all is combined for the general good. Thisplan has been adopted with advantagein other communities, cities, States,Territories and countries, and it can be in this more extensively than it has been hitherto. 
 OBSERVE THE SABBATH DAY.  81I pray that God will bless us, and bless this whole people; and I pray that the testimony which we have received here during this Conference, which is true, may not be forgotten by us.  I can bear the same testi-mony.  I know this work is of God.I know Joseph Smith was a Prophet of God.  I have heard two or three of the brethren testify about brother Young in Nauvoo. Every man and every woman in that assembly, which perhaps might number thousands, could bear the same testimony. I was there, the twelve were there,and a good many others, and all can bear the same testimony. The ques-tion might be asked, why was the appearance of Joseph Smith given to Brigham Young? Because here was Sidney Rigdon and other men rising up and claiming to be the leaders of the Church, and men stood, as it were, on a pivot, not knowing which way to turn. But just as quick as Brigham Young rose in that assem-bly, his face was that of Joseph Smith—the mantle of Joseph had fallen upon him, the power of God that was upon Joseph Smith was upon him, he had the voice of Joseph,and it was the voice of the shepherd.There was not a person in that as-sembly, Rigdon, himself, not ex-cepted, but was satisfied in his own mind that Brigham was the proper leader of the people, for he wouldnot have his name presented, by his own consent, after that sermon was delivered. There was a reason for this in the mind of God; it con-vinced the people. They saw and heard for themselves, and it was by the power of God.May God bless you.  May he give us wisdom to direct us in all things,and promote all the interests of Zion for Jesus' sake.  Amen. 
 THE SIGNS OF THE COMING OF THE SON OF MAN, ETC.   275DISCOURSE BY ELDER WILFORD WOODRUFF,DELIVERED IN THE 13TH WARD ASSEMBLY ROOMS, SALT LAKE CITY,JANUARY 12, 1873.(Reported by David W. Evans.)THE SIGNS OF THE COMING OF THE SON OF MAN -- THE SAINTS' DUTIES.My address this afternoon will be intended for those who profess to be Latter-day Saints -- those who have entered into co[v]enant with the Lord our God.  I am surrounded with those who know by experience that we are dependent upon the influence and inspiration of the Holy Ghost to enable us to teach the things of the kingdom of God.  My faith is that no man, in this or any other genera-tion, is able to teach and edify the inhabitants of the earth without the inspiration of the Spirit of God.  As a people we have been placed in positions the last forty years which have taught, in all our administra-tions and labors, the necessity of acknowledging the hand of God in all things.  We feel this necessity to-day.  I know that I am not quali-fied to teach either the Latter-day Saints or the world without the Spirit of God.  I desire this this afternoon, and also your faith and prayers, that my mind may be led in a channel which may be beneficial to you.  In my public teaching I never permit my mind to follow in any channel except that which the Spirit dictates to me, and this is the posi-tion we all occupy when we meet with the Saints, or when we go forth to preach the Gospel.  As Jesus told his Apostles, Take no thought what ye shall say, it is told us, Take nothought what we shall say ; but we treasure up in our minds words of wisdom by the blessing of God and studying the best books.We are told in the 24th chapter of Matthew that Jesus, on a certain occasion, taught his disciples many things concerning his Gospel, the Temple, the Jews, his second com-ing and the end of the world ; and they asked him -- Master, what shall be the sign of these things?  The Savior answered them, but in a very brief manner.  As my mind runs a little in that channel, I feel disposed to read a portion of the word of the Lord unto us, which explains this matter more fully than the Savior explained it to his disciples.  That portion of the word of the Lord which I shall read, is a revelation given to the Latter-day Saints,March 7, 1831, forty-two years ago next March.  It commences on the 133rd page of the Book of Doctrine and Covenants.-[The speaker read the revelation, and then resumed his remarks as follows]- :I want to ask who are looking for the fulfillment of these events, and who upon the earth are preparing themselves for the fulfillment of the word of the Lord through the months of Prophets, Patriarchs and Apostlesfor the last six thousand years? 
 276   JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.Nobody that I have any knowledge of, without it is the Latter-day Saints, and I for one feel that we are not half so much awake as we ought to be, and not half as well prepared as we ought to be for the tremendous events which are coming upon the earth in quick succession in these latter days.  Who can the Lord ex-pect to prepare for his second coming but his Saints?  None.  Why?Because, as is said in this revelation, light has come forth to the inhabitants of the earth, and they have rejected it, because their deeds are evil.  Thismessage has been proclaimed among the Christian nations of Europe and America, and in many other nations,for the past forty years.  Inspired men -- the Elders of Israel -- have gone forth without purse or scrip declaring the Gospel of life and sal-vation to the nations of the world,but they have rejected their testi-mony, and condemnation rests upon them therefor."  As the Prophet said, "Darkness covers the earth,and gross darkness the minds of the people."  Who believes in the fulfill-ment of prophecy and revelation?Who, among priests and people to-day, has any faith in the sayings of Jesus Christ?  If there be any peo-ple besides the Saints whose eyes are open to the great events which will soon overtake the nations, I wouldlike to know and visit them.  I would to God that the eyes of the Latter-day Saints were open far more than they are to those things that rest upon them!  The Lord is look-ing to them alone to build up hisZion here in the mountains of Israel,and to prepare the bride, the Lamb's wife, for the coming of the Great Bridegroom.  I believe in the ful-fillment of the revelations which the Lord has given to us, as much as I believe that I have a soul to save or lose, or as much as I believe in the shining of the sun in the firmament of heaven.  Why?  Because every word that God has ever spoken, whe-ther by his own voice out of the hea-vens, by the ministration of angels, or by the mouths of inspired men,has been fulfilled to the very letter as far as time has permitted.  We have fulfilled many of the sayings of the Prophets of God.  The revelation I have read this afternoon was given forty-two years ago.  Has there been any sound of war since then?  Has there been any sound of war in our land since that period?  Has there been any standard lifted up to the nations, any gathering together of the people into these mountains of Israel from nearly all nations?  There has [.] We have had a beginning, the fig tree is leaving, putting forth its leaves in the sight of all men, and the signs in both heaven and earth all indicate the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ.When my mind, under the influ-ence of the Spirit of God, is open to comprehend these things, I manytimes marvel and wonder, not only at the world but also at ourselves,that we are not more anxious and diligent in preparing ourselves and our families for the events now at our doors, for though the heavens and the earth pass away, not one jot or tittle of the word of the Lord will go unfulfilled.  There is no pro-phecy of Scripture that is of any private interpretation, but holy men of God spake as they were moved upon by the Holy Ghost, and their words will be fulfilled on the earth.We are approaching an important time.  As Jesus once said, The world hate me, and without a cause,therefore I have chosen you out of the world, and the world hate you also.  The servant is not above his master, you are not above me, they have hated me and they will hate 
 THE SIGNS OF THE COMING OF THE SON OF MAN, ETC.  277you.  The Lord has chosen the Lat-ter-day Saints, and through them has sent a message to all nations under heaven.  The Zion of God is opposed by priest and people in every sect, party and denomination in Christendom.  The Elders of Israel have been called from the plow, plane, hammer and the various oc- cupations of life, to go forth and bear record of these things to the world.  We have followed this up until the present time for more than forty-two years -- forty-three years next April.  The kingdom has stead-ily grown, and while we have la-bored we have seen the fulfillment of the word of the Lord.  The sea has gone beyond its bounds, there have been earthquakes in divers places, and there have also been wars and rumors of wars.  These are only a beginning, their fullness has not yet opened upon the sons of men, but it is at their doors; it is at the doors of this generation and of this nation.  And when the world rise up against the kingdom of God in these latter days, shouldthe Saints have any fears?  Shouldwe fear because men, in their secret chambers, concoct plans to over-throw the kingdom of God?  We should not.  There is one thing we should do, and that is, pray to God.Every righteous man has done this, even Jesus the Savior, the Only Be-gotten of the Father in the flesh,had to pray, from the manger to the cross, all the way through; every day he had to call upon his Father to give him grace to sustain him in his hour of affliction and to enable him to drink the bitter cup.  So with his disciples.  They were baptized with the same baptism that he was baptized with; they suffered the same death that he died, being cru-cified as he was.  They sealed their testimony with their blood.  Never-theless all that Jesus said concerning the Jews has had its fulfillment to the present day.  This should be a strong testimony to the whole infidel world of the truth of Christ's mission and divinity.  Let them look at the Jewish nation and the state of the world, in fulfillment of the words of the Savior eighteen hundred years ago in Jerusalem.  It is one of the strongest testimonies in the world of the fulfillment of revelation, the truth of the Bible and the mission of Jesus Christ.  The Jews have fulfilled the words of Moses, the prophets and Jesus, up to the present day.  Theyhave been dispersed and trampled under the feet of the Gentile world now for eighteen hundred years.When Pontius Pilate wished to re-lease Jesus Christ, saying that he found no fault in that just man, the high priests, scribes, pharisees and other Jews present on that occasion cried, "Crucify him, and let his blood be upon us and upon our children." [##Matthew 27:22-25##]Has it not followed them to this day, and been manifest in their dis-persion, persecution and oppressionthrough the whole Gentile world for eighteen hundred years?  It has.And they have to fulfill the words of the Lord still further.  As I have been reading to you to-day, the Jews have got to gather to their own land in unbelief.  They will go and rebuild Jerusalem and their temple.  They will take their goldand silver from the nations and will gather to the Holy Land, and when they have done this and rebuilt their city, the Gentiles, in fulfillment of the words of Ezekiel, Jeremiah and other prophets, will go up against Jerusalem to battle and to take a spoil and a prey; and then, when they have taken one-half of Jeru-salem captive and distressed the Jews for the last time on the earth, their Great Deliverer, Shiloh, will 
 278  JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.come.  They do not believe in Jesus of Nazareth now, nor ever will until he comes and sets his foot on Mount Olivet and it cleaves in twain, one part going towards the east, and the other towards the west.  Then,when they behold the wounds in his hands and in his feet, they will say,"Where did you get them?"  And he will reply, "I am Jesus of Naza-reth, King of the Jews, your Shiloh,him whom you crucified."  Then, for the first time will the eyes of Judah be opened.  They will remain in un-belief until that day.  This is one of the events that will transpire in the latter day.The Gospel of Christ has to go to the Gentiles until the Lord says "enough," until their times are ful-filled, and it will be in this generation. Forty years have passed since the revelation I have read was given to the sons of men.  We are living in a late age, although it is true there are a great many vast and important events to transpire in these days.But one thing is certain, though the Lord has not revealed the day nor the hour wherein the Son of Man shall come, he has pointed out the generation, and the signs predicted asthe fore-runners of that great event have begun to appear in the heavens and on the earth, and they will continue until all is consummated. If we, as Latter-day Saints, want anything to stir us up, let us read the Bible, Book of Mormon and the Book of Doctrine and Covenants, they contain enough to edify andinstruct us in the things of God.Treasure up the revelations of God and the Gospel of Christ containedtherein.As an individual, I will say that I feel a great responsibility resting upon me, and it also rests upon you.Joseph Smith and Brigham Young alone have not been called to build up in the latter day that great and mighty kingdom of God which Dan-iel foretold, and which he said should be thrown down no more for ever.  I say, they were not called to be the only ones to labor in building up that great and glorious Zion, which was to become terrible to all nations; nor their counselors,nor the Twelve Apostles; but this responsibility rests upon every one of the Lord's anointed upon the face of the earth, I do not care who they are, whether male or female, and the Lord will require this at the hands of all the Latter-day Saints.I therefore desire that we may be awake to these subjects, and to the position we occupy before God and in the world.The inhabitants of the earth may hate and oppose us, as they did Jesus Christ, and as they have all inspired men, as they did Noah,Enoch, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob,Isaiah, Jeremiah, and all the pro-phets who ever lived.  They have always been a thorn in the flesh to the world.  Why?  Because they had enough independence of mind to rebuke sin, to maintain the promises of God unto man, and to proclaim the declarations of the Al-mighty unto the inhabitants of the earth, fearless of consequences.  The last song sung here was, "Do what is right, let the consequence fol-low."  That is what I say to the Latter-day Saints.  Let us do what is right, maintain our religion be-fore God, be valiant in the testimony of Jesus Christ, and prepare our-selves for his coming, for it is near,and this is what God requires at our hands.  He leans upon no other people; he expects from no people but those who have obeyed his Gos-pel and gathered here, the accom-plishment of his great work, the building up of his latter-day Zion 
 THE SIGNS OF THE COMING OF THE SON OF MAN, ETC.  279and kingdom.  And, as I have said, this responsiblity rests not only upon Prophets and Apostles, but upon every man and woman who has en-tered into covenant with him.  I say that we are too near asleep, we are not half awake to the position that we occupy before God, and the responsibilities we are under to him.We should be on the watch tower.Who is going to be prepared for the coming of the Messiah?  These men who enjoy the Holy Ghost and live under the inspiration of the Al-mighty, who abide in Jesus Christ and bring forth fruit to the honor and glory of God.  No other people will be.  There never was a more infidel generation of Christians on the face of the earth than there is to-day.  They do not expect that God will do anything in a temporal point of view towards the fulfill-ment of his promises; they are not looking forward for the establish-ment of his kingdom, or for the building up of his Zion on the earth.  Their eyes are closed to thesethings, because they have rejected the light.  When Joseph Smith brought this Gospel to the world,there was a great deal more faith in God, a great deal more faith in his revelations, and, according to the light they had, a great deal more pure and undefiled religion than there is now.  We have carried the Gospel to all Christian nations whowould permit us, and they have rejected it, and they are under con-demnation.  Our own nation is un-der condemnation on this account.This land, North and South America, is the land of Zion, it is a choice land--the land that was given by promise from old father Jacob to his grandson and his descendants, the land on which the Zion of God should be established in the latter days.  We have been fulfilling the prophecies concerning it, for the last forty years.  We have come uphere and established the kingdom;True, it is small to-day, it may be compared to a mustard seed, but as the Lord our God lives, the little one will become a thousand, and the small one a strong nation, and the Lord Almighty will hasten it in his own time, and the world will learn one thing in this generation, and that is, that when they fight against Mount Zion, they fight against the decrees of the Almighty and theprinciples of eternal life.I rejoice before God that I have lived to hear the principles of eter-nal life proclaimed to the sons of men; I rejoice that I have lived to see this people gathered together, I rejoice in coming to the land of Zion with the Saints of God.  When we came here twenty-four years ago,we were a little handful of men, pioneers; we came to a parched and barren desert.  Since then we have built up six hundred miles of cities, towns, villages, gardens, farms and orchards; and while doing this we have had to contend with the opposi-tion of both priest and people.  Have they prevailed?  They have not, and they will not.  Why?  Because he who sits in the heavens, the Lord ourGod, has decreed certain things and they will come to pass; because the Lord is watching over the interests of this people.  He requires us to work with him, he is at work for us.It is our duty to build these temples here--this in Salt Lake City, another in St. George, in Logan or wherever they may be needed for the benefit of the Saints of God in the latter days.I think many times that many of us will get to heaven before we shall want to go there[.] If we were to go there to-day, many would meet their friends in the spirit-world and it would be a reproach to them, for 
 280  JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.you, Latter-day Saints, in one sense of the word, hold in your hands the salvation of your dead, for we can do much for them.  But I think many times that our hearts are too much set on the vain things of the world to attend to many important duties devolving upon us connected with the Gospel.  We are too much after gold and silver, and we giveour hearts and attention to temporalmatters at the expense of the light and truth of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.We have not much time to spare as a people, for a grea[t] work is re-quired at our hands.  I know that, without the power of God, we should not have been able to do what has been done; and I also know that we never should be able to build up the Zion of God in power, beauty and glory were it not that our prayers ascends into the ears of the Lord God of Sabaoth, and he hears and answers them.  The world has sought our overthrow from the beginning, and the devil does not like us very well.Lucifer, the Son of the Morning,does not like the idea of revelation to the Saints of God, and he has in-spired the hearts of a great many men, since the Gospel was restored to the earth, to make war against us.But not one of them has made any-thing out of it yet--neither glory,immortality, eternal life nor money.No man or people ever did make any-thing by fighting against God in the past, and no man or people will ever make anything by taking that course in the future.This is the work and kingdom of God; this is the Zion of God and the Church of Christ, and we are calledby his name.  The Latter-day Saintshave to abide in Christ, and we can not do that unless we bring forth fruit, any more than the branch of the vine can unless it abide in the vine.To abide in Christ we must enjoy the Spirit of God, that our minds may be enlightened to comprehend the things of God.  When I look at the history of the Church of God in these latter-days I many times marvel at whathas been done and how we have progressed, considering the traditions, unbelief, failings, follies and nonsense that man is heir to in the flesh.  We have had a great many traditions to overcome and the opposition of the world to contend with from the beginning until to-day.  Brethren and sisters, we should be faithful.  The Lord has put into our hands the power to build up his Zion and kingdom on the earth, and we have more to encou-rage us than was ever possessed by any generation that has preceded us.  We have the privilege of build-ing up a kingdom that will stand for ever.  Noah and the Antediluvian world did not have this privilege.Enoch built up the Zion of God a little while, and the Lord took it away.  Jesus and the Apostles camehere. Jesus fulfilled his mission,preached the Gospel, was rejected by the Jews, and was crucified.  His disciples had a similar fate, and the Gospel was taken to the Gentilenation, with all its gifts and blessingsand power, and Paul the Apostle of the Gentiles warned them to take heed lest they, in turn, should lose it through their unbelief.You know how it has been with them--that there has been a falling away, and that for seventeen hun-dred years the voice of a Prophet or Apostle has not been heard in the world; and now again, in these lat-ter days, the Lord Almighty, re-membering his promises made from generation to generation, has sent Angels from heaven to restore to man the Gospel and has given au-thority to administer the same.The Revelator John, says he saw 
 THE SIGNS OF THE COMING OF THE SON OF MAN, ETC.  281an angel flying through the midst of heaven, having the ever-lasting Gospel to preach to them that dwell on the earth, to every nation, kindred, tongue and people,saying with a loud voice, "FearGod and give glory to him who made the heavens, the earth, the seas and the fountains of water, for the hour of God's judgment has come."Oh! ye Gentile nations, wake up and prepare yourselves for that which is to come, for as God lives his judgments are at your door.They are at the door of our nation, and the thrones and kingdoms of the whole world will fall, and allthe efforts of men combined cannot save them.  It is a day of warning,but not of many words, to the na-tions.  The Lord is going to make a short work, or no flesh could be saved.  If it were not for the mani-festation of the power of God what would be the fate of his Zion and people?  The same as in the days of Christ and his Apostles.  The Lord has had Zion before his face frombefore the foundation of the world,and he is going to build it up. "Who am I," saith the Lord, "that I promise and do not fulfill?"  The Lord never made a promise to the sons of men which he has not ful-filled, therefore Latter-day Saints, you have all the encouragement inthe world to sustain you in the faith that the Zion of God will remain onthe earth.  The work is in ourhands to perform, the God of hea-ven requires it of us and if we fail to build it up we shall be under con-demnation, and the Lord would remove us out of the way and he would raise up another people whowould do it.  Why?  Because the Almighty has decreed that this work shall be performed on the earth, and no power on earth or in hell can hin-der it.I would here say to our delegate to Congress, when you go to Wash-ington, have no fears with regard to the opposition of men.  You have every reason to go in confidence, and do your duty, knowing that the Lord will stand by you, and so has every man in the Church and kingdom of God, I care not where we are placed or what God requires at our hands.  He is at the helm, and he has protected us until to-day.  Where should we have been a few years ago when the army was sent to destroy us, if it had not been for the protection of the Almighty?We should not have been here.And so it will be in days to come.The world hate us because the Al-mighty has called us out from the world to proclaim his Gospel and build up his kingdom.  Let us be faithful, for the Lord is going to protect us, and build up Zion.  He will also gather Israel, rebuild Je-rusalem and prepare the way for his second coming, in the clouds of heaven.  Then let us, Latter-day Saints, wake up to our duty.  Thinknothing too hard that the Lord re-quires of us.  Let us build this Temple that we may attend to the ordinances for the living and the dead.  If we not do this we shall be sorry.  When I see men who have received the word of God, and tasted the powers of the world to come, and then turn away, I think of the par-able of the five wise and five foolish virgins.  It will pay us to be wise and to have oil in our lamps, to have fellowship with the Holy Spirit, and to live our religion and keep the commandments of God day by day.Brethren are passing away.  I have been away three or four weeks on a visit to the people in the upper settle-ments, and since my return I hear of this man and that man dead, whom I saw well and hale before I went away. 
 282  JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.So it will be with us in a little while.We shall pass away and go to the other side of the vail, and the burden of the building up of Zion will rest upon our sons and daughters.  Then rejoice in the Gospel of Christ.  Re-joice in the principles of eternal life.I am looking for the fulfillment of allthings that the Lord has spoken, and they will come to pass as the Lord God lives.  Zion is bound to rise and flourish.  The Lamanites will blos-som as the rose on the mountains.  I am willing to say here that, though I believe this, when I see the power of the nation destroying them from the face of the earth, the fulfillment of that prophecy is perhaps harder for me to believe than any revelation of God that I ever read.  It looks as though there would not be enough left to receive the Gospel; but not-withstanding this dark picture, every word that God has ever said of them will have its fulfillment, and they, by and by, will receive the Gospel.  It will be a day of God's power among them, and a nation will be born in a day.  Their chiefs will be filled with the power of God and receive the Gospel, and they will go forth andbuild the new Jerusalem, and we shallhelp them.  They are branches of the house of Israel, and when the fullness of the Gentiles has come in and the work ceases among them, then it will go in power to the seed of Abraham.Brethren and sisters, let us remem-ber our position before the Lord!  Let us try and keep the faith, let us labor for the Holy Spirit, that our hearts,minds and eyes may be opened, that we may live by inspiration, that when we see dark clouds rising and evilsstrewing our path, we may be able to overcome [.] The Savior was tempted,so were his Apostles, and if we have not been we shall be.  As the Lord told Joseph Smith, "I will try and prove you in all things, even unto death.  If you are not willing to abide my covenants unto death, you are not worthy of me."  Did Joseph abide unto death?  I think he did,and he with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, will sit at the right hand of the Lord Jesus Christ, and will re-ceive his glory and crown.  He was true and faithful unto death, and his testimony is in force to-day, in lan-guage as loud as ten tho[u]sand thun-ders.  Whether it is believed or re-jected it will have its fulfillment on the heads of this generation.By and by great Babylon will fall and there will be wailing, mourning and sore affliction in her midst.  The sons of Zion have got to stand in holy places to be preserved in the midst of the judgments that will shortly over-take the world.  We can see how fully the revelation, calling us to go to the western countries, has been ful-filled.  In less than forty years, a standard has been lifted up, and peo-ple gathered here from France, Eng-land, Scotland, Wales, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and almost all the nations of the earth in fulfillment of that revelation.  When it was given no man among us knew anything about Salt Lake or the Rocky Moun-tains; but it has been fulfilled before our eyes.  We have come up here, and in so doing have fulfilled the re-velations of God, so far.  Let us continue, I pray God my heavenly Father that he will bless the Latter-day Saints; that he will give us his Holy Spirit and wisdom, that our eyes may be opened, that we may have faith in the things of God.  Let a man lose the Holy Spirit and what faith has he?  None, either in God or in his revelations, and that is what is the matter to-day.  You may take the best friends we have outside of of this kingdom, and you can hardly get them to believe that God has any- 
 THE SIGNS OF THE COMING OF THE SON OF MAN.  283thing to do with the affairs of men, or that he has power to do anything for them, either as individuals or na-tions.  If their eyes were open one moment they would understand that God holds them all in the hollow of his hand, weighs them in the balance and that they cannot make a move without his permission.  They would no longer wonder why the Latter-day Saints have faith in God if their eyes were open so that they could under-stand the work and things of God.They can not understand it, they cannot even see the kingdom of God unless they are born of the Spirit of God, and they cannot enter into it unless they are born of the water and the Spirit, according to the words of Jesus to Nicodemus.I have a desire that we may be faithful in our mission and ministry,as Elders of Israel and as Saints of God, that we may do our duty, and maintain our position before the Lord.Let our prayers go up before him.  If I have any forte it is prayer to God.We are not called to build up Zion by preaching, singing and praying alone; we have to perform hard labor, labor of bone and sinew, in building towns, cities, villages; and we have to continue to do this; but while we are so engaged, we should not sin.  We have no right to sin, whether we are in the kanyon draw-ing wood, or performing any other hard labor, and we should have the Spirit of God to direct us then as much as when preaching, praying, singing and attending to the ordinan-ces of the house of God.  If we do this as a people we shall grow in the favor and power of God.  We should be united together, it is our duty to be so.  Our prayers should ascend before God, and I know they do.  I know that President Young is prayed for--I know that his counselors and the Twelve are prayed for, and that the Church and kingdom of God is prayed for.  We should continue this, and if we pray in faith we shall have what we ask for.  The Lord has taught us to pray, and I rejoice that I have learned to pray according to the order of God, for in this we have a promise--that where two or three agree in asking for any thing that is just and right, it shall be granted unto them.May God bless you!  May he give us wisdom, and his Holy Spirit to guide us, that we may be enabled to be true and faithful to our covenants,and be prepared to inherit eternal life, for Jesus' sake.  Amen. 
 Elder Wilford Woodruff. No man can preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ without the spirit and power thereof no matter what his, qualities are; and there never has been a time when this spirit is more needed than now. Related incidents that occured during his missions in the world. when the power of evilspirits was made manifest, Especially on the in-troduction of the Gospel in England. Apostacy is the result of these evil influences. Refered to the great apostacy in Kirtland. Said, God will take care of His Church, of the leaders, all who hold the Priesthood; and we must sustain them, or we will go to destruction as many have. Had not Joseph and those associated with him accepted the revelation on Celestial marriage, this gospel would have been taken from the Earth. And I beleive 
 1875the same same is true of the United Order. Wecan see the hand of the Lord in the movement concerning genealogy in the Eastern States. This is the result of the revelation concerning Bap-tism for the dead. We are now enabled to trace our genealogy to all our progenitors behind the vail. The prophet of each dispensation Seals his testimony with his blood. Related his ex-perience at the time the prophet Joseph was killed. The Church has passed into a new dispensation, and our leader will not be assasssinated, all who oppose Israil will go down—judges, Govenor, Presidents &c. The Mothers of Isral have the training of their chil-dren, as the Elders are from home; hence they have great responsibility 
 Elder W. Woodruff, illustrated the differencebetween the Prophet Joseph and the Rev. Drs. of the day. We are asked why the Lord chose one in ign-orance to reveal His Gospel. It was to have one who ^would^heed His word. Alluded to the mighty occurrenciscotemporaneous with the Gospel. Especially the histor-ical & genealogical Society of New England. Ifthe Prophet Joseph had refused the revelation onCelestial Marriage the Church would have stoppedthere. In all ages of the world, God has had thoseSpirits who were called before the foundation of the world through whom to reveal His will. This is thecase to-day with the United Order of which we seemto be afraid. As if God would reveal any thing forour harm. Uttered condemnation for manyof the follies & extravagances of fashion. God, theHoly Prophets and all the hosts of Heaven arelooking to us to for help. Let us do it. 
 Elder W. Woodruff spoke of the privilege of bearing a testimony. He said, the Gospel of Jesus Christ is just as true to-day as it ever was ^yet^, but very few people are independent enough to serve the Lord. This is God's work, and there are but few who can be used as the Lord desires, they would want their own way, hence the Lord chooses the obedient, and not partial thereby. Even the Apostles of the Savior were men of low degree. The Lord will prevail and nothing can stay His hand. We are to be a tried people, as we heard this morning. Yet the faithful will be saved as has been revealed, for every revelation will be fulfill-ed. Elders have compassed the world, and always been sustained. We will be held accountable for 
 1876all things we receive, for the Lord has all things. No generation before has ever had so much to perform as we have. Spoke of the organization of the church by the Prophet Joseph—of its completeness and power, all of which is the result of God's providences manifested in our be-half; for it is His work, yet we must do our part. The year the baptism of the dead was revealed, a society was organized, to obtain the genealogy and history of the society as well as others. Spoke at length on this subject, urging the Saints to prosecute the work on the Temple; that the living and the dead may be cared for. I desire now to labor only with the Saints and for the dead. He said, there are millions to be cared for. 
 SYNOPSIS OF A DISCOURSE BY ELDER WILFORD WOODRUFF,DELIVERED IN THE PROVO MEETING HOUSE, OCT. 13, 1877.(From the Territorial Enquirer.)THE WORK PROGRESSING-PROPHECY FULFILLED-WE SHALL ALL OBEY THE LAW OF DEATH.It was with pleasure I listened this morning to the remarks of bro-ther Snow, and wish that all the people in this Stake had heard them.We have had a great deal of preach-ing, and need a great deal, and I don't know that a people ever lived who had more.We are in the valleys of the mountains for a special purpose-to establish righteousness and live in accordance with the principles of truth. There never was a generation of people who had so much to per-form as the Latter-day Saints have.This work is progressing, and it will continue to advance. I have seen the time when you could get the whole Church into this room — when there were a few High Priests, no Apostles or Seventies, and only a few Elders. I am as thoroughly satisfied now as I ever was in my life, that this is the kingdom of God. I am as firm a believer in God, in the reve-lations of God, in the Books of Mor-mon and Doctrine and Covenants, as I ever was. I have read the prophe-cies of Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel and other inspired writers, and have seen some of them fulfilled, and expect to see others have their literal ful-fillment. God worked with the children of men through revelation, and he will continue to do so in this generation. With him there is no change; his ways are one eternal round.The Lord has directed and guided this work from the beginning. The prophecies relating to the present dispensation — to Zion being estab-lished in the tops of the mountains —to the building of cities and Temples 
 THE WORK PROGRESSING, ETC. 135— are being fulfilled. We have no-thing to do but build up the king-dom of God, and the more light and understanding we get, the less our hearts will cling to outside things.While we are engaged in this work, we can realize that holy angels are watching us. The Lord told us, forty-seven years ago, what would take place, and we are now fulfilling that which he spoke of. Brothers Joseph and Brigham are gone into the spirit world, but there are a fewof us left to continue the work laid out by the Almighty. We have preached to the world, organized the Priesthood and the Saints, and angels have borne record of this, and it is recorded in heaven — our toil, our preaching, and our testimony.We have filled these once desert places with Saints of the living God,and many thousands are here who never saw the world. We have to build Temples — one is almost com-pleted and is dedicated; we have laid the foundations of others, andthe work, like a panorama, is before us. This labor is not to be per-formed by other hands. God looks to us to build these Temples, and to bring about the redemption of the earth. He holds us responsible for this work; we have to preach to the house of Israel — to the Laman-ites — to gather together the honest in heart from all parts of the earth.We are chosen to perform this great and important work-we, a small handful of people compared with the millions of human beings on the earth. The Lord does not expect any other people but the Latter-day Saints to do this work; there is no-body else preparing.One after another of our brethren have left us and gone to labor on the other side of the veil. President Brigham Young, brother George A.Smith, and others before them, have all gone, and the few that are left of the Twelve will also go by and by;but while here, it is our duty to labor on the foundation they have laid. President Young labored hard and faithful during the last few years of his life in organizing and building up Zion. We have to continue the work they were engaged in, and when our time comes to take our departure for that life behind the veil, none of us will regret having devoted our time, talents, and labor for the accomplishment of this great object. The riches of the world will appear as the dust under our feet compared with the eternal reward before us.This kingdom will never be given into the hands of another people.We may pass away, but our sons and daughters will have the labor ontheir shoulders of building up the kingdom.Many of you may have read, years before it was fulfilled, the revelation and prophecy of the Prophet Joseph in regard to the trouble, anarchy,and war that should befall this na-tion. Wise men said its fulfillment was a matter of impossibility-that the government was too sound and too well established for such a cala-mity to occur, but the fulfillment came. When the Lord undertakes to perform a work, he is certain to carry it out. It would not take the Lord twenty-four hours to cause war, anarchy, confusion, and judg-ments to come upon the nation. He is withholding these calamities untilhis purposes are accomplished.The set time has come, and the world is preparing itself for these things. The Church and kingdom of God must adorn itself, and prepare for the coming of the Great Bride-groom. Every key relating to this dispensation was given to the Pro-phet Joseph, and they remain with 
 136 JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.the Priesthood today. We have no right to walk in the dark. The burden is now resting upon us, and, holding the Priesthood, our aim should be building up of the kingdom of God. We hold the Priesthood for that purpose, and we have no business to use it for any-thing else but to officiate in the ordinances of the house of God.Sooner or later we shall have to obey the law of death. As it is written, "In Adam all died, so in Christ shall all be made alive."  Weshall have to pass through the ordeal — there is no escape from it. Wehave, consequently, no time to throw away. It may be asked, "How much longer will it be before the winding up scene takes place?  It is not for me to say. How muchlonger have the Elders to sufferviolence at the hands of the wicked?It appears to me that the world is about ripe for the judgments of the Lord, and that the testimony will soon be sealed. He is already work-ing with the Lamanites, and he will accomplish a great deal in a little time.Some people entertain the ideathat because wheat is plentiful and selling at exceedingly low figures,the probability of a famine is more remote than ever; but the Lord makes no mistakes about what is going to transpire. He has decreedthe visitation of judgments, and they are certain to take place. President Young has for years repeatedly im-pressed upon the brethren the neces-sity of preparing for a period of famine by storing their wheat, and, before his death, was impressed to speak to the sisters and urge them to look after that matter. Let us be united in our labors, and in allthe branches of industry that males or females may be engaged in. Theraising of silk may be rendered an important item in the industry of this Territory. It is a business that our wives and children can engagein, and there is nothing to hinder the people from becoming rich from this branch of industry alone. There is an improvement in the United Order, or Co-operation. The Saints are preparing themselves for that event when Jesus shall come as a thief in the night. For our ownsakes let us do the best we possibly can. We must observe and keepthe laws of God, in order to inherit the rewards promised. Let us not set our hearts on the riches and vanities of this earth. It is very convenient, it is true, to have the comforts of life around us, but we shall be better without them, if by hoarding up the riches of the world we forget the things of God.I pray God to bless you and our sons and daughters, that their minds may be led and prepared for the work they will be called upon to perform. 
 Apostle W. Woodruff addressed the congregation Said.Joseph Smith was asked once by a clergaman, if all the people outside of the mormons, to which the Prophet replied yes, and one half of them if they do not repent.Spake of the great number of men and women who had joined the church, and afterwards apostatise from the church.  And lost their Priesthood, their power, Glory, dommions.Read a prayer offered up by Joseph the Prophet in Liberty Jail, in relation to the long sufferring endured by hinself & coreligen-ousts.  The general duties of the Saints was dwelt upon, and, the magmatude of the great work before us.  Spoke of great benifit the B. Y. Academy was doing in the land and hoped it would receive the liberal support of the Saints.encouraged the Young to qualify themselves for the great work before them. 
 Pres. W. Woodruff: Spoke of the dealing of God in the history of the world.  Had noticed that whenever nations departed from the paths of vuirtuue and righteousness, they were cast down.  Whenever men served God he upheld and and sustained them.  But of all the changes that have taken place from Father Adam one thing has never changed -- and that is the Gos-pel of Jesus Christ.  Referred to the mechanicalimprovements of the latter times, all tending to the gathering of Isreal in these days.  Spoke of ancient prophecy and its litteral fulfillment.Spoke of the stupendous work of the Saints in the few years they have been in the valleys of Ephraim.  Spoke of the swift judgments that would come upon those who have persecuted the Saints.  We have not got through with the warning of the nations.  I am getting more en-larged in my feelings regarding the people of the nations, we are baptizing a hundred a month in the Southern States.  The Lord will fight our battles if we will keep his commandments and build his temples.  The young men will have to bear off this kingdom.  Made a powerful exhort-tation to the Saints to be faithful. 
 Apostele Woodruff made remarks as follows. Saidthat while he was in Arizona Gen. Sherman [rewoh]was there; remarked that it was a shame for the govern-ment to charge the Mormans any thing for the land.But the time will come when we will see theblessings and wisdom displayed in sending thatthat colony. As I have often said, it seemed almostimpossible toofor mortal man to live in these valleys whenwe first come here. But we shall soon understandwhy God wants these places setted. The Lord re-quires many things of us that has not been requiredof others generations. The Lord expects us to workwith him in the redemption of his Kingdom. The timewill come when we will be required to practicewhat we teach. Important events are about to transpirein Zion. 
 BLESSINGS, ETC.BLESSINGS--TRIALS--OBEDIENCE TO COUNSEL, ETC.Remarks by Elder Wilford Woodruff, delivered in the Bowery, Great Salt Lake City,Sunday Morning, September 27, 1857,We are glad to see the brethren return home from their long missions or short ones.  We are glad to greet them, to hear them talk, to see their faces, and to hear their testimony that the Lord has been with them,  These things are a pleasure to us who re-main here in Zion.  There are a multiplicity of evidences that God is with this people, and that the Lord has been with his Elders, whereverthey have been, from the beginning of this work.There has been something peculiar connected with the Elders of this Church from the beginning.  You may take the rest of the world, poli-tically, temporally, spiritually, or any other way ; and there never has beensuch an example in the eyes of hea-ven, earth, or hell as has been in the Elders of this Church, in preachingthis Gospel to the nations of the earth.  The hand of God has been in the work from the beginning, and it is in it yet; and the hand of the Lord has been with them to succour them all the time.  The revelations given from heaven, through Joseph, concerning the Elders, have been fulfilled to the very letter.There are many things that are consoling ; and one is, to know that the Lord is with us—that he does reveal his mind and will in the ordi-nances of the house of God, and through the administration of bles-sings, whether by Patriarchs, or by the Twelve Apostles, or in the endow-ments.  We find those blessings are fulfilled to the very letter.The brethren to-day have spoken in reference to the blessings that are given to our brethren when they go out on their missions to the various nations of the earth.  I remember the day very well when we blessed those missionaries that went to India and to Europe; and I must say that I never had such a variety of feelings as I had at that time.In blessing brother Luddington, I recollect that I was mouth, and I well remember that I could see nothing but seas, waves, and storms.The seas appeared to be heaped up,and I knew that he was going to see storms and be exposed to troubles and dangers.  But there was one thing that we did bless those brethren with that I rejoice in, and that is that they should return home again.Well, our words have all been ful-filled to the very letter, and this gives us consolation.  If we go forth, and have the Priesthood and Apostleship upon us, the Holy Spirit of God, though it may not be visible, does dictate to us; and it is so in ordaining:  it is so in going to battle against the nations of the earth, who have given their consent to the shed-ding of the blood of the Prophets.Brother Brigham feels calm and serene as a summer's morning; and in his desire to save Israel he wishes to save also the lives of our enemies,if possible.  Why is he so calm and 
 JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.steady?  It is because God is with him; and though armies are ap-proaching and ready, apparently, to swallow up this people, yet he and his brethren feel calm, and the Lord reveals unto them, by the Holy Spirit,how to govern and control this people.They have had a long experience in proving the Almighty God, who holds the destiny of the Saints and the sinner.  And has he ever failed us?No, never.Some of our brethren have told their trials here to-day, and they have said that they have not done much;but the greatest work they have done has been in saving themselves.  But this is not all they have done.  They have done something else; they have accomplished the purposes of God in India—as much so as though they had baptized every king and queen in those islands:  they have literally fulfilled the revelations of Jesus Christ in carrying the Gospel unto them, because those nations could not have been left without excuse and the earth prepared for the judg-ments of God, if those Elders had not gone and preached to the people of those nations.  No matter if they had not have baptised one, they are as much justified as we who first went to Herefordshire, England, and bap-tised twenty or thirty priests in a day.  They have fulfilled the com-mandments in carrying the Gospel to the nations.It is no testimony to me that a man is not faithful, because he has not baptised numbers of princes, lords, governors, and kings; not at all.  The Lord has sent them there: he has tried them and put them in strait places; but has he left them?No, he has not.  Has he not brought them forth?  We have had the testi-mony of brother Musser, who is here;and we see that it is the hand of God that has been over them, and we are glad of it; and we do not expect that the Lord will send the Elders out there again until they have other missionaries and messengers that they cannot stone, tar, or feather, but mes-sengers that will come with their sharp sickles:  then they will find that they have messengers that they cannot conquer or overcome.I feel to rejoice in these thingsand to know that the Lord is at workwith this people.  We are living in a fast age—an age fraught with great events, and every day is bringing to pass more of the predictions; and more revelation is being fulfilled in one year, now, than has been fulfilledin centuries before.  We are living in a day when that flood of revelation is coming to a focus; and that focus we stand in, and we are seeing it fulfilled day by day.The wicked rage and the heathen imagine a vain thing; and they say, "Let us go and take a prey and a spoil; let our eye be upon Zion, and let her be defiled."  But they know not the thoughts of the Lord, neither under-stand they his counsel.  God willwork for us and defend us, if we do our duty, and Zion will soon be free.We will not suffer the oppressions of our enemies as we have done.You need not fear: all we have to do is to be passive in the hands of the Lord, and follow the counsel of our leaders, and not be particularly anx-ious that the Lord should reveal to you or to me his mind and will and intentions concerning our present difficulties; but pray earnestly that the Spirit of the Lord may be upon those men who stand at the head.All we have to do is to live our reli-gion; and when the Presidency say "Come here," or "Go there," let us be on hand to obey, and all will be right.Let the people be quiet and praythat God may reveal his mind and willto those at the head.  We may have our ideas of what we should do in this 
 BLESSINGS, ETC.or that case; but there is no man so well qualified to lead, govern, and direct for the salvation of the people as that man whom God has appointed.We have as good leaders as we need.There never was a better leader given to Israel, nor one more capable of leading this people to salvation, thanBrigham Young: he is filled with the Spirit of God day by day.  If the United States make war upon this people, the Lord will hold them re-sponsible for it, and the measure they mete will be measured unto them again; and if they are ripe and the cupof their iniquity full, they will be shat-tered to pieces--their union broken up and destroyed.  They will be visited with thunder and lightning and hail and the judgments of God; and every man that will not draw his sword against his neighbour will be obliged to flee to Zion.  They are sending their armies here to destroy us; but I ask none to weep for Utah or spend their sympathy for us—not even my relatives or the priests, the doctors, lawyers, or editors; no, not even one soul—from the President of the United States down through the whole nation,who have given consent to our death;for they will have plenty to bear them-selves, and they may save their weep-ing for themselves and their children.The Lord will teach them that their proud looks and haughty feelings will be laid low.  It is right to pray and it is right to keep our powder dry.  Pray for the Presidency of this Church--pray for them to have the Spirit of revelation.  We have never seen a day when "Mormonism" was taking such a stride as it is at the presenttime.  They may come over the Plains singing their songs about what they will do when they get to Utah; but many of them will find a place in hellbefore they get here.There have been many truths taught here to-day.  Many who have been here for years do not know or realize the great blessings we are enjoying inthese valleys of mountains. Our gra-naries are filled with bread and we enjoy peace and the comforts of life.We come to the Tabernacle of God and associate with holy men, and we should be holy ourselves: if we are not, it is our own fault.You have all the blessings which the celestial kingdom and laws of God impart unto men on the earth, while the Gentile nations have suffered ruin,wickedness, and abominations of every kind to increase in their midst untilthey are ripe for destruction.  Do they not thirst for the blood of the Saints and every man who is righteous?  Do they not delight in wickedness?   They are full of wrath and anger, and they are ripe for the damnation of hell.Yes, the nations of the earth are ripeto-day.Then we should be faithful and diligent in all things committed to our charge.  Even though the Lordhas suffered some of the brethren to go through strait places, in days which are past and gone, and he may stillcall us to go through strait places, yet he will sustain us when we trust in him.The Lord has suffered some of our Prophets and Apostles to be martyred; and what for?  That the cup of the iniquity of the nations might be fulland that his servants might be crowned heirs of God and joint heirs with Jesus Christ to a martyr's crown.Through the persecutions of theenemies of truth, many of the Saintshave been worn out; but, as a body, the kingdom and people have been led off as victorious conquerers. We stand now and hold the keys of the Americancontinent; we stand in the Strong cham-bers of the mountains; and can theLord God give us the Victory? Hecan and he will, and he has been pre-paring us for this by pouring out upon us his Holy Spirit, uniting the peoplewho have been willing to repent and 
 JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.forsake their sins; and I hope we shall continue faithful to the end.I am glad, and my soul rejoices in these things, and I believe that the people are ready to shoulder their guns and walk into these kanyons and line them from here to Fort Bridger in defence of the Constitution of the United States and the rights which both the laws of God and man guar-antee to us.We have had to stoop to our ene-mies heretofore and bear many things from them worse than death; but if there is anything that gives us joy and consolation—at least, I can speak for myself—it was when I heard the bre-thren say, "You are free, brethren—you are free; and you may prove yourselves before God and men that you are willing to defend yourselves against tyrants and oppressors."When I heard this, I was full of joy; and who would not be?  Who wouldnot rather die than bow down to the yoke of the enemy?  It would sweeten death to a man to know that he shouldlay down his life in defence of free-dom and the kingdom of God rather than to longer bow to the cruelty of mobs, even if the mob have the name of being legalized by the nation.I thank God and I rejoice that this people are determined to be free frommobocracy and oppression, and that they are determined to have peace, if they have to fight for it; and if the yoke is ever put on again, it will be by our- selves: and I say, God bless this peopleand the missionaries that have gone to the nations—no matter whether they have baptized one or a thousand,if they have done the will of God.Notwithstanding the lightningsmay flash, thunders roll, and earth-quakes bellow, the Lord will extend his hand over his servants and protect them as he has done those that have returned unto us.  And the Lord will remember our brethren that are on the Plains; and let us remember them in our prayers, that the Lord may be on our side; and let us be on hand and be ready at any and every call, andthe kingdom will spread abroad, and it will smite the image not only on the toes but on the head; which may God grant for our sake.  Amen. 
 Report of the four months ending April 30th 1878after which Elder W Wordruff spoke on theunity of the faith and action among the truebelievers in the Gospel of Christ and the des-position of man in all ages to oppose its ex-istence 
 At 2 P.M. Meeting resumed Apostle Wordruff —introduced his remarks with the Quotation "Straight is the Gate and narrow is the way &c reverting tothe task of the Saints in keeping the path of theGospel beset with temptations, which would be overcome with the help of God and faith in his strongpromises to help those who confided in him. spokeof the rapid growth of the work in Joseph's day specialRevelation was given in regard to special individualcalls for missionary service while now large numbersare called and set apart for Missionary Service onaccount of the demand for their Labors being so great 
 Apostle W Woodruff: refered to the teaching's ofthe Prophet Joseph Smith relative to warningsand impressions recieved at times which shouldbe acted upon relating incidents of impressionsrecieved and acted upon during his life whichhad saved his own and the lives of others. 
 Apostle W Woodruff  followed on the bleessings theobservance of the Law of Tithing brought to theSaints. blessed as we were so apparent to thetraveller passing through our midst, we shouldbe careful to discharge this law and also meetall obligations promptly that confidence may be maintained 
 Prest Willford Woodruff followed, referring to the great advantages the Latter-day Saints of the present age had over all the people to whom God had previously manifested himself and the Gospel, more Revelations were given, more inspired men lived to instruct the people, which together with the easy access to the inspired works, the Bible, Book of Mormon,and Doctrine and Covenants, made a combination of instruction that no other people had prior to the present day. 
 Prest  W Woodruff: then addressed the congregation dwelling upon the great blessings enjoyed by the people through their obedience to the laws of the Gospel, referring to the rapid growth of the people in acquiring the comforts of life around them, the wonder of the nations at the success that attended the work and the bitter end of many of those who had from time to time opposed the work citing individual cases, exhorting the people through their knowledge of these facts to live faithful to their covenants. 
 Prest W Woodruff  then addressed the audience expressing himself in strong terms "that the time had come when the Elders of Israel must pratice what they teach in order to effect upon the minds of the people," especially should it be or in regard to the Word of Wisdom: concluding with "I view you Brethren holding the priesthood as chosen before the world was, to work here upon the Earth to support his cause. 
 PRESIDENT'S OFFICE,Salt Lake City, Utah, Aug. 30, 1888.Elder James W. Bean,Stake Clerk, Utah Stake.DEAR BROTHER:Your communication of the 27th. inst., addressed to myself and theQuorum of the Twelve, informs me that, in accordance with a resolution adoptedby the unanimous vote of the priesthood of Utah Stake, you send your communica-tion asking for ten thousand dollars -[$10000.00]- of the tithing of the Stakefor the current year, to aid you in the completion of the Utah Stake Tabernacle.The position of the Church in financial matters is such at thepresent time that it is impossible for us to comply with this resolution. Weshall have to strain every nerve and use all the means within our possession,or that is likely to come into our possession for some time, to meet the engage-ments that are already contracted. In view of this, the Council of the Apostlessome weeks ago decided to cease making appropriations, for the present, for thebenefit of any meeting houses in our settlements. We have had a number ofapplications since then, which we have filed away, to be taken up in their orderwhen circumstances become more favorable. The case at which the Council stopped 
 was one that appealed very strongly to their sympathies, but it was thoughtthat it was a good place to stop at, as there would probably be no other casethat would be likely to call forth aid more strongly than it. The presentprospect is that we shall need all the tithing tahat we can collect to meetoutstanding engagements and to pay our currect expenses; and if we can do thiswithout contracting debts, we shall feel happy.Trusting this explanation will be satisfactory to the priesthood ofUtah Stake, and regretting the necessity which compels this line of action,I remain, Your Brother,Wilford Woodruff 
 CopySalt Lake City, UtahApril 7, 1881Dear Bro. John W. Young,Elders Erastus Snow, Brigham Youngand Jesse N. Smith were appointed last fall by the First Presidency of the churchin counjunctionwith yourslef to take charge ofthe interests of the saints and the care andoversight of all their parties which might beworking on the lines of the Denver and Rio Gandeand Altantic and Pacific Railroad in grading,furninshing ties, laying track +c, and to makecontracts and to asist in making contractsin their interests, and instruct and counsel them in the duties of their religion, and in the management of their busness affairs,and in securing the means that should be due to them upon their contracts.  A Letter of Instructions was written by the First Presidency for the guidance of these Eldersand yourself in the duties assigned to you,in which you were directed to do everything necessary to give all equal rights in the variousjobs and you were instructed to see thatthe supplies should be provided Rubyechto the action or adjustment of the Variousboards, no one man, or a few men to receivethe profits there from and that everythingwas to be done in the mlerch of all.  That 
 Letter said"I wish to impress upon you and the brethrenwho will labor in the conjunction with you, thatit is not the privelege of any man or companyof men to take advantage of the circumstancesof the people and their necessities and farmthem out for their private profit.  As latterday-Saints we are all equal, and we should labor for each other's benefit--and no man should selfishly build himself up or enrichhimself at the expense of his brother orbrethren.  If he has superior advantageseither of position or of skill, let him havea fair remumeration there for;but beyond this he should not go.  He should labor as we all should for the welfare, advancement and prosperity of the people.  In this way good feeling will be maintained and the saints will see that their leading men are their truefriends, and are not disposed to oppress themand to make mechandise of them.  There is freahroom for the mereaso of confidence in thisdirection, and we hope that you will dr use all your influence in creating their con-fidence and in showing your brethren that we have their true welfare at heart.  If wetake this course and act together in this manneramong ourselves, and maintains the same principlesof equity in our dealings with other who are 
 not of us, the reputation of the Latter-day-Saints will be greatly increased and influencewill be created in our favor that will result in incalculable benefit to us as a people, for the world is so destitute of these qualitiesthat when people witness them they are im-pressed by theim and recognise and acknowledgetheir worth.as to yourselves, for the labor hwich you perform among the people in counselling, indirecting, in securing contracts and in seemythat all the business is properly alleuded to,and that the pay can be relied upon, youshould derive a reasonable percentage.  We have thought that in view of all the expensesconnected with the labor, five per centwould be a proper amount; but of coursewhen you many other agents secure contractsand perform other labor connected there with,for this small percentage, it should not beexpected that you will, in the event of the company failing to make payments, be responisblefor the Day."since the return of the elders Erastus Snow and Brigham Young we have leaned that  they and Borther Jesse, N. Smith submitted a memorandum in writing to you embodying some of the principal points of the letterof instructions and requiring you to hold 
 sacred the money received in estimates for gradingless the maount necessary for to pay forsupples furnished and sking for [your] actionon your part with them in securing to thesub contractors just dues under the contractsmad eiwhtthem by Elders Brigham Young and Jesse N. smith.  Mis. Memo: they signedand requested you to sign, but we are in-formed you declined to do so, thought, you had telegraphed, upon receipt of the letter of instructions that youaccepted and would be governed by the provisions of that letterand this was, and is the under=standding of the entire Council res=pecting your telegrams to Brother Brigham.  Viewing your action in refusing to sign this memorandumsubmittd to you as a vioationof the Letter of instructions anda breach of faith with the Coun=cil, and a departure from your expressed agreement, the Councilof the Twelve Apostles has de-cided that it could not presentyour ame at the Conferenc etothe people as a counsellor.  It was therefore omitted without 
 comment.  The Council has also decided that you be summon=ed to appear before it in this City forth with to show causewhy you hould not be dealt with accorning to the laws of theChurch for this conduct.

But as it was the Officer prooved to bea latter Saint then those that bore the name, he gavehim money to help him on his journey, for ^he^ repented ofwhat he had done, he did not stand back as those holybrothers did but he saw he was in distress and administeredto his wants.

 Washington City Jan. 17th [18]50Dear Brother,Your kind favor of the 10th was received yesterday. The intelligence fromthe valley is quite cheering.  The discovery of a coal an iron are of far more value to us than a goldmine would be. Since my arrival here I havebeen pretty busy among grave Senators, impulsiverepresentatives of the people, and other functionaries.Business progresses very slowly in Congress, the organ-ization of the House is not yet completed, thoughmore than six weeks of the session have alreadypassed. Though there is scarcely a ray of hope ofour admission into the Union as a State, the prospectof our obtaining a territorial ^organization^ is far from beingdiscouraging, and an influential Senator hasgiven me encouragement to hope that we may beauthorized to elect our own officers. Some timeago I understood that Mr Stanton of Kentucky hadreceived a remonstrance to our memorial.  I suspect-ed its character and called to see him, he kindlyfavored me with a perusal of it. It charges uswith a number of the foulest deeds & abominationsin the dark catalogue of crimes, and is signedby William Smith and thirteen others.  MrStanton was very friendly, but deemed it his dutyto present it in the House.  On the 31st Ult.

 enough to have brought him along comfortable but Dudlyhad none therefore my husband devided with him to the lastcent before he got to Philadelphia, Dudley promised to getmoney there and pay him, but instead of that he shipedhim there, and left him without money or friends.That is a speceman of the dealings of laterday saints. butI thank my Hea^v^enly father that the time is a comingwhen he will meet his accusers face to face then willit be known who is the mi[s]erable slanderers' and theinocent shall then be made known, And let OrsonHide beware! God will not alway have an unriteousjudge over his people, nor will those that would walkuprightly suffer persecution, Prehaps you may think Iwrite this with some bitterness of feelling, I have reason toI have seen enough of their dealings with my Husbandand I can hold my peace no longer. So long as my Husbanmoney to give those dear brothers, and a home for thenmonth after month it was all well enogh, but whenhe was reducted in his circumstances by fowllowing themwest by the mob, and sickness and he had nothing moreto give; then he must be cast off as not worth saveing.This looks like buying Salvation with dtoo dear a priceand if we are ever saved I trust it will be withthose of better principles, as to the papers you allude toI knew not that he had any if hear I will find them andburn them for they can be of little use to him, as he has to workat his trade, to support his family besides there is no-one here thatheran would hear the Doctrine praeached, and I should hear to 
 Underwood of Ky. electrified the Senate by the presentationof a copy of the same remonstrance in the Senate.The honorable Senator was somewhat excited, gavea synopsis of its contents, thought the charges aughtto be investigated, and moved its reference to theCommittee on Territories of which he is a member.The other remonstrance was also presented in the Housethe same day, an abstract of which appeared in thepapers the following morning, and created consider-able sensation. The same evening I called at JudgeUnderwood's, but he was absent, however the next morn-ing I had an interview with ^him,^ and another two or threedays afterward, explained matters to him, and gothim pretty well satisfied.  I also called on theChairman of the Committee on Territories in theHouse, and other members,and with the review ofcounteracting the effect it had produced and wasproducing I deemed it expedient to have the enclosedarticle published in the Republic, the government organand afterward called on the editors of ^the^ Union,Globe and National Intelligencer, and requestedthem to republish it while they did, two of themwith some prefatory remarks. Immediately afterthis I received, and I thanked God for it, MrKinkead's account, and other favorable intelligencefrom the valley, which I have had published inthe four principal papers of this city.  I omitted tomention that Mr. Underwood at the time he presented 
 what he said just as soon with out the papers, as with them.I would never hurt my Husbands feellings by leting himsee the letter you sent if he has not allready seen you as heproposed to do, ^when he^ whent away, I epect he is on his returnnow in a vessel that malled from this port.God: forgive me if I say any thing amiss, but when I think howmy husband was respected before he came in to this Church, inthe Baptist church to which he belonged he was beloved as amember, and looked up to as one of the pillars of the church andnow he must be belied by a set of misecrents that is not worthyto carry his old shoes after him, and as long as I can speak I willnot hear my husband so belied as I know he has been and hold mypeace, this you may tell Orson Hide on any one else.  I know howmy husband was treated in St Louis by the Presideing Elder and otherwould be  [page torn] ask Brother E T Benson he knows my husband betterthan any one else and prehaps will render a more just account.I do not blame you for I well know by whose instignation it is thatyou speak as you do, and I hope I shall not say anything to hurt yourfeellings but you must be ware how you condem an inocent manwho posesses more soul than as many of those (insignificant beings Icould mention) as could stand between here and the salt lake.Prehaps if my husband was here he would not allow me to write asI do but it is my first feellings from the impulse of the momentI would like to have you write to me and give me such coulnirelas you think I need and the progress of the church for I have heardnothing since I left St Louis last fall, give my love to sisterwoodruff for I e^s^teem her as a worthy woman ask he to writemeYours Respectfully  Cynthia Dam 
 William Smith's memorial, he also read a paragraphfrom a newspaper accusing ^us^ with having arrestedGen Wilson, Pomeroy and others, and imposing a dutyof 50 per cent on all merchandize brought into the valley.  Senator Truman Smith informed me on Sat-urday evening that he had just received a letterfrom Gen Wilson ^who spent some time in the valley en route for California^ in which he spoke of our peoplein the most flattering terms, that he had really usedstrong language, that he had written to the Presidentenclosing Gen Wilson's letter, and when he returnedit, he would publish so much of it as relates to Deseretand its inhabitants with some remarks of his own.I shall have it immediately republished in all theprincipal papers of the City.  I shall send youa copy of it.  I have addressed a note to the HonorableSenator to-day, requesting him to give it publicityat his earliest convenience.  I was presented to thePresident some time since, and stated to him theobject of my visit to Washington, his reply was, "Thatlies in the breast of Congress." A report has recentlybeen in circulation to a limited extent, that thePresident had said at a dinner party at the WhiteHouse that he would veto any bill that may bepassed for the benefit of the Mormons, and I havereason to beleive that it is not entirely withoutfoundation in truth, but notwithstanding thatthere will be no difficulty in that quarter I beleiieveon what I regard as excellent authority.
