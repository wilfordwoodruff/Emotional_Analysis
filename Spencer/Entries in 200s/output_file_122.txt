George Davisson Grant &amp; Do S L Sprague Dunyon was standing around his body  as I gazed upon his claye Tabernacle without his spirit I felt to  exclaim A mighty man in Zion is laid low A valiant man in Israel  has fallen I felt that a great champeon in the kingdom of God was taken   ENDENTRY  hurried to close up his work He has been preaching for several months calling upon the people to repent his voice has been like the Trump of the Angel of  God &amp; he has laboured night &amp; day untill He was laid prostrate with sickness  He has shot the arrows of the Almighty with great power among the people.  He Called at the Historians office on the 19 was then sick. He was confined to his house 10 days before he died He had  a great vision while He was sick which he told to the brethren he preached  nearly all the time that He was sick &amp; he related all that he saw in the spirit  world    great trembling &amp; nervous excitement &amp; it seemed as though her frame would shake  to peices we lade hands upon her &amp; rebuked the Devil which seemed to sieze her  tabernacle &amp; she became more calm.    laying out the body of Brother Grant I spent the night with him    ENDENTRY December 2, 1856    found him quite sick I administered unto him then I went to my house got  a piece of fine linen &amp; Mrs Woodruff accompanied me to Brother Grants  I gave them the linen to make a garment &amp; Robes to lay out the body in. I  went to President Zina Young to go down &amp; help make the  Robes she gave me a seat President Young came in &amp; spoke of Brother  Grants Death said we had done all we could to save his life but the  powers the other side of the veil were stronger than we were &amp; he was wanted  there. Sister Zina Young walked with me to President Grants &amp; spent the day with the sisters in makeing the robes. I felt sick &amp; went home &amp; went  to bed &amp; was sick through the day. Filmore today    ENDENTRY December 3, 1856       ENDENTRY December 4, 1856    The doors of the House was flung open for the people to visit the corps many  thousands went through the House to visit the body at half past 9 the Military  began to form in open lines from the residence to the Tabernacle 3 bands of  Music were in attendance. The Lieutenant General &amp; staff, General Grant staff &amp;  Lancers were in attendance &amp; a company of York masons formed in the  procession the corps was removed to the tabernacle &amp; the House filled up  &amp; many that could not get in. But it took so long to get through  with the ceremonies of the Morning that it was 10 minuts to 12 oclok when  President Brigham Young arose to speak as it was so late He did not  speak but a short time &amp; said He did not answer remarks were vary interesting &amp; instructive at the close of the meeting  the procession was formed &amp; the corps conveyed to the grave followed  by the largest procession ever formed on such an occasion in this  valley. at the Grave President Young made some remarks He said  we have no cause to mourn for Brother Grant and you have made  a far greater display here than was necessary for more so than  Brother Grant would have wished &amp; a far greater display than  I wish you to make over my body when I die Brother Grant  is well off &amp; He has lived more in advancement &amp; far riper for  Eternity in 40 years than many would in a Hundred when I die  I ownly want you to let my body rest in the grave I want to be buried decently  but I do not wish any great Display at my funeral let your flags lie still  &amp; all your military display. I hope the body of Brother Grant may lie here  undisturbed  people for Brother Grant. it is cold let the people go home &amp; let the bearers stay  &amp; see the grave filled up properly. The procession then returned to the House  during the evening I called upon Brother Grants family I then attended  meeting in the 14   ENDENTRY December 5, 1856       ENDENTRY December 6, 1856    the Bishop &amp; council &amp; priesthood of the 14 was present. I sat &amp; herd the report of the Bretheren &amp; when I  FIGURE was requested to speak by Bishop Hoagland I arose &amp; said  that  Men as teachers to the gentile stores to preach the gospel to them  But the spirit said to me it was not wisdom to send men to preach  the gospel to them I considered they were wicked &amp; corrupt &amp;  it was like casting pearls before swine when I closed F. D. Richards  Backed me &amp; up &amp; bore testimony that I said was true. Then Bishop  Hoagland arose &amp; opposed me vary strongly &amp; said He presided over the  14 ward &amp; had sent the Teachers to preach to the Gentiles &amp; he wished  them to go &amp; do it I at once saw the  him when He sat down the Teacher arose &amp; said what shall I  do Brother Woodruff says do not go to those Gentiles Bishop Hoagland  says go. I arose &amp; said to the teachers obey your Bishop for He says he will take the responsibility upon himself in sending teachers  to them many of the Priesthood were fired up upon the subject  but the meeting closed &amp; we went home At about 5 oclok the  Calafornia mail came in &amp; Brother Richards &amp; myself went up  to President us &amp; Bishop Hoagland President Young was asstonished at the position  which Brother Hoagland had taken He said the devil was leading  him into dificulty which he could not extricate himself without  Help. He immediately sent for Bishop Hoagland who came up &amp; the  subject was all talked over &amp; President Young showed him his  Error &amp; he saw it President Young told him that the Twelve held the keys of the Kingdom of God in all the world where  the presidency are not, &amp; that No Bishop presided over any  one of the Twelve in any place the Bishop Made his confession  and went home we sa       ENDENTRY December 7, 1856    &amp; W Clough Preached in the afternoon I Attended the prayer  Circle. Heard the Letters read from Elders Hyde &amp; others  Elder Orson Hyde calls for 100 more men thinks there will be  a prospect of a fight with the Calafornians. President Young  said He wished all the men were at home &amp; that Elder Hyde  was at home in his store &amp; that He would not take any  Mission while he lived for He had lost the spirit of his  office &amp; was of no account. It made the President feel  sorrowful to see the Twelve &amp; others not feel the spirit of their  office. At the close of the meeting I went home &amp; with my  family went to the 14 ward meeting in the Music Hall I was  much pressed in spirit. After listening to the speeches of Brothers  Hunt, Candland, &amp; Pack I was requested to speak I arose upon my  Feet though heavily pressed in spirit yet the spirit of God was in my tabernacle like fire shut up in my bones and I spoke to the people  FIGURE about 3/4 of an hour and I scearsly knew whether I was in the body  or out of   the House of Death while the spirit of God filled the House.   ENDENTRY  &amp; I can say as I have heard Brother Joseph say while smiteing upon his  breast I would to God I could unbosom my feelings in the house of my friends,  but I do not expect to do it but in a small degree for my mind is open in  vision of things which I cannot utter or speak unto you for it is not  lawful or expedient if I had the ability to do so. I am pained in spirit as I  see the Bishop &amp; council &amp; teachers &amp; missionaries labouring, toiling, rebuking &amp;  pounding the people trying to remove over this City &amp; the 14 naries before me to night to go to work &amp; search deeply your own hearts &amp; get  the spirit of the living God upon you remove the fog &amp; darkness from your  own minds &amp; then you can see clearly to remove the darkness from the minds  of the people. The priesthood need the spirit of God in order to know how to deal  with the people &amp; save them for when you knock the people in the Head in order to wake them, when they get awake you should not still pound them untill you  kill them. but get a Fatherly feeling &amp; try to save them. Some of the teachers  when they go through the ward to teach the people they get the big head &amp;  do not know ^how^ to treat the people. it is not nessary to stand here &amp; jump  &amp; shout &amp; stomp off 50 cts worth of sole leather in order to get the people  to wake up or reform but it is a straight forward business matter to reform  whare any one has stolen or done wrong in any thing let them return what  they have taken &amp; make restitution. It is a momentious time in Israel &amp; it is necessary for this refermation in order to have the people prepared for the  great things of God which are comeing upon the Earth &amp; upon this people  the line will be drawn &amp; scenes will take place which will try mens  souls &amp; I warn all men &amp; women before me this night that they do not  make light of the things of the Kingdom of God or of this refermation  for destruction is nigh the doors of such as do it &amp; I warn our young  Brethren &amp; Sisters that they humble themselves before God &amp; give heed to the  words of Eternal Life listen to the council of the Bishop &amp; Missionaries &amp;  teachers among you for if you despise the council of God &amp; his servants  judgment will come upon you &amp; destress &amp; anguish will be upon you. The  Lord is calling loudly upon this people to repent &amp; do the works of righteousness  &amp; Live your religin remember the Testimony of Brother Grant the testator  is dead but the testiment is in force his hard labours to awaken this  people have cost him his life He has laid down his body in the grave  I made many other remarks while the fire &amp; power of the Holy Ghost  was burning within me. At the close of the meeting I called the Bishop  &amp; priesthood to gether &amp; gave them instruction concerning the wrong cours  Bishop Hoagland had taken with me I taught them the order of the  Priesthood Bishop Hoagland was humble &amp; made all necessary satisfaction    ENDENTRY December 8, 1856    meeting of the Missionaries &amp; Bishops. Presidents Kimball were  present also W. Woodruff &amp; F D Richards of the Twelve     of which answered to their names. F. D. Richards opened By Prayer &amp; singing W. Woodruff arose &amp; said I feel as though I want to say a few word it has seemed good unto the Lord to call a portion of us through  the mouth of his servants to go forth unto the inhabitants of this  City to preach the gospel of salvation &amp; repentance unto the people, we  have met each week to give a report of our procedings but have not here to fore been associated with the Bishops in our meeting  I stand connected with you as a missionary &amp; realize that those  who have assembled here this evening should stand as the candle &amp;  light of the Lord. I have never felt more responsibility resting   ENDENTRY  the gospel of Repentance to the people &amp; so had the servants of the Lord who  sent us forth. I feel that it is necessary to purify ourselves &amp; get  the spirit of God before we can properly go forth to preach to the people  if we will get the darkness &amp; fog from ourselves we can take it  From the people &amp; the Elements will be Clear. I feel to purify myself I  have felt the spirit of God resting upon me of Late &amp; I feel that there  is great things awaiting us. The Presidency of this church has  had the Head Heart &amp; soul ake for a long time it has  caused their hearts to ake to see the Apostles &amp; Elders of this church  who bear the priesthood forget their calling &amp; turn from the work  of God unto Folly &amp; have their hearts set upon the things of the world we may use the sledge hammer to much but we should be right  ourselves when we reprove others. The Bishops &amp; Missionaries in  some instances have manifested a feelings for the mastery to know  who should be the greatest but they would not have this feeling if  they had the spirit of God. The Business of the Missionaries is  to call upon the people to repent &amp; live their religion &amp; the Bishops should unite with them in the spirit of God to carry out this Great  work. How Long shall we see the Presidency of this Church weighed  down to the Earth with a Burthen which the Elders &amp; people should  bear. Aris up ye Bishops &amp; missionaries &amp; put on the whole armor  of God &amp; the people will live their religion when you live it  yourselves then the burthen will begin to lighten upon the presidency  some time when we sharply rebuke the people we are not right ourselves th of our calling &amp; help bear the burthen that is resting upon the shoulders  of Presidents Kimball. No man could live with the  Load resting upon him that is now upon the head of those men  unless he was nerved up &amp; sustained Daily by the hand &amp; power  of God. I feel brethren that there is sumthing important awaiting  us. The more I humble myself before God &amp; get the Holy Ghost the  more my heart is drawn out towards the presidency of this  Church I have never seen the day in my life when I have  felt to prize the society &amp; council of those men as I do at the  present time, this people have not prized them &amp; their teaching  as they ought &amp; if they do not more appreciate their labour  &amp; keep their council better than they have done they will  be taken from us. Brethren lay aside all your selfish feelings  &amp; you will see that God will be with us let us wake up ourselves  &amp; then the people not for this winter ownly but let the refermation  last during our lives. Presidents Young &amp; Kimball are present  &amp; I would like to hear them teach &amp; council us this evening but  I presume they feel as though they had taught us so long &amp; so much  which we have not improved upon that they feel discouraged in teaching us, &amp; think we ought to know how to walk aright But  I do not wish to occupy your time the spirit says I should close  May God Bless you Amen     Brother Woodruff has given us a good testimony a Living testimony  in the spirit &amp; power of the Holy Ghost. Now any of the rest of  you who have the Holy Ghost arise &amp; speak to us those things which  will Edify. E. D. Woolley then spoke a Few moments  then President Young arose &amp; spoke to the people the following  is a synopsis of his remarks as I reported them all Brother Kimball   ENDENTRY  I have learned to governe it may be asked if this is a new work it is not a new work but our  refermation is the work we begun in when we embraced the gospel. I  have pointed out the Errors of the people all the time &amp; shown the people ther  faults &amp; told them what to do but here is the difficulty as soon as the Elders  come home from their missions in a few days they lay down their Armour  while they should keep  are engrossed with the things of the world &amp; lie down &amp; go to sleep their ownly  ambition is to know how they can get this House built or a farm, Horses  cattle &amp;c, their whole soul is in the work of the world not the building of  the Kingdom of God but any man that gets property upon this principle  it will carode him he has not wisdom to use it. I have told the people  a hundred times they do not know how to get rich. The way for the  people to get rich is to do the will of God &amp; they must be governed by the  Revelations &amp; spirit of God. Brother Woodruff has told us here to night  how it is when I look upon the conduct of the people before the refer mations commenced as I was teaching them the way of salvation daily  &amp; they would not give heed to it pained my heart &amp; I felt as if I  should die but when Brother Jedediah M Grant steped forward  &amp; took the Burthen off from me I was relieved But it has cost   have lived a few Years longer in our midst. I have felt that unless  this people would awake &amp; live their religion I must go down to  the grave But the burthen of this people was taken from me &amp; rested  upon him &amp; it has not yet returned to me although he is dead should  it return to me as it has been I shall soon  for I could not live long with that wait upon me. When you first  recieved the gospel  the gospels armour &amp; would it not have continued with you  if you had lived your religion all the time but you have had bad  feelings in your Breast &amp; against your Neighbour but if the spirit of  God had continued with you it would have overcome those evil  feelings and what if we were all to put our armour off &amp; partook  of the spirit of anger &amp; Hatred God would spue us out of his mouth  &amp; we would go down to hell together &amp; He would raise up another  people to do his will. After all the stuper that has rested upon this  people they have been gaping for more revelation I do not mean one  man but I mean the whole people while they have already a great deal  more than they are worthy off &amp; if this people do not wake up &amp;  live their religion The  which they now have from the people, it is not a few men that have  got to live their religion but it is this whole community. If we as  a people will return unto the Lord I know he will receive us with  open arms. I am glad that this winter has commenced without  Fidling &amp; danceing. But would their be any harm in going into the  Hall &amp; haveing a dance if we felt right &amp; kept the spirit of God with  us, No there would not. But as soon as we should open this door  how many would keep the armour on &amp; live their religion &amp; keep  the spirit of God not many, some would but many would say come  let us go &amp; take a drink &amp; begin to get the liquor in them &amp; then they would  say come Brother Brigham I am ready for any thing stand out  of the way here Hurrah for Hell sware a little Dam a little steal a  little gamble a little, &amp; raise the Devil. But we will stop Fidling &amp;  danceing untill the Brethren get power to overcome these things &amp; keep  them under their feet. I do not intend to start danceing again untill the   ENDENTRY  weakness of man I am incompassed with it, I know what it is to fight it all the time. If you are going to continue a refermation make up your mind  to live your religion. If the people will do this it will be as Brother Woodruff  says the darkness will pass away &amp; I can live long among this people &amp;  so can brother Kimball &amp; other men But if this people will go on lieing  stealing swearing &amp; whor the people &amp; go to God &amp; let the wicked go to Hell I hope that God will send the wicked that will not repent ^go^ down to hell quickly &amp; be burned up  that they may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus. When I first came into  this church I was an Enthusiast &amp; thought I would never keep an account  never put pen to paper nor never say this or that was mine but it is the  Lords we never can be of one heart &amp; one mind untill we can say that all  we have is the Lords &amp; that we are ^ownly^ his servants &amp; stewards to controll it according to his will. When the Lord gives me property He gives me wisdom to use it.    If I have any property Horses Cattle waggons or any thing Els my neighbor  has no right to stell it from me. and if the people have the spirit of the  Lord they would know that it was not right to take any thing which belonged  to another without liberty but let it remain whare it is. we are accounting  for our time to the Lord now if you have a months leasure time &amp; you gamble that away &amp; do not bring to pass any good you might just as well throw  away $20 and you are accountable for this waste of time. I am often  asstonished at the folly of this people many women are asking their  husbands for some new thing they want a dozen new Dresses &amp; many  unnecessary things but does a person want of Doz new Dresses if this  people would ask for those things which are necessary &amp; do right you would  soon see the people get rich. but what are you doing? are you rich No. the  Lord can send the grasshoppers Crickets &amp; Locust they are his Armies &amp; can  Eat us up and kill our Cattle He can give us much or little as He pleases  If our eyes are single to the glory of God &amp; we do our duty the Lord  could make us as rich as Cesar what would do with it aggrandize  yourselves, no you should not, but send out millions of men to gather  the poor &amp; send men with mules loaded with gold to buy the Nations  but now we are poor &amp; we can comparitively do but little. Now I am here with  Brother Kimball If you wish to ask any question we can answer right but  for me to teach the Bishops there duty it is folly for I have taught them  over &amp; over for years. Now if I was going to a ward meeting to preach  and the bishop was to oppose me unless it was my duty to reprove him I  should sit &amp; laugh at him but not contend with him. But when their is any  difficulty between a missionary &amp; Bishop or any two men they should not  contend about it before the people but talk it over among themselves  &amp; settle all diference of opinion in the spirit of God &amp; not labour for  the mastery    J. M. Grant He took hold of the work to wake up the people  with all his might &amp; it killed him. If President Young was to ask me  to go forth in the sa life as it did his. I have never felt as though Jedediah was dead  the saviour said those that abide in me will never die his spirit is  with us &amp; he can do more for us now than he could before. The spirit of God is poured out upon some men mightily. The refermation is doing good  &amp; the people are doing better &amp; those who get the spirit of God will stand  &amp; those who do not will fall. The people are forsaking their sins   ENDENTRY  wants t wants and this I am thankful for and I feel perfectly easy about it all. You will find when the Lord sees that  we are willing to fight &amp; get Just ready to shoot that He will  fight our battles. He said G. A.

He wished Mr Livingston  to intercede with Col Johns as they had nothing against him ownly that He was a Mormon But Mr Livingston would do nothing for him He reports that  their is much of the spirit of Desertion in the camp the  officers treat their soldiers in a cruel manner. Capt Cook  is considered a Cruel Tyrant &amp; several of his soldiers said  ^said^ they would kill him if they had a chance, several soldiers  talked with southworth &amp; said they would desert if they could. He said the greatest amount of any one article in camp  was ardent spirits He thought there were 100 waggon loads Howard Livingston had an outfit of Liquor which cost  him ten thousand dollars worth at first cost, and that all the  Armey had a great amount as well as all the Suttler's the officers  were drunk evry day.

He said Col Allexander was an old Granny the Govornor Cummings was a whiskey tub, in appearance about such  a man as Brother Blazzard would be if He drank a quart of  whiskey per day.

The American Government with James Bucannan  at their head as president, have sent forth An Armey  of 2,500 men fully armed and Equipt for war for the sole  purpose of destroying the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter  Day Saints &amp; the Kingdom of God from off the Earth. This  Church and kingdom of God has been driven from the midst of the people in the United States into the vallies of the  Rocky Mountains a thousand miles from the confines   ENDENTRY  of what is called Gentile Civilization whare they were  in hopes we would perish but as soon as they found that  we would live &amp; prosper they became alarmed &amp; were  resolved upon our destruction and Hence they send their armies out to accomplish their Hellish purpose as soon  as it was known unto us President Brigham Young the  prophet seer and Revelator &amp; leader of the Church and  kingdom of God Rose up in the strength of Israel God  and proclaimed Israel Free and said they should be  Free from that hour if they would obey his council  &amp; follow his preceps. His councillors Heber C Kimball  &amp; Daniel H Wells and also the Quorum of the Twelve  Apostles backed up his Testimony &amp; sustained him in  his decissions And all the people said Amen so let it  be. President Young testified unto the people in the name  of God if they would be United with him in their faith  prayers &amp; works that the Enemy Should not have  power to come into our valley that the Lord would hedge  up their way &amp; we should not be called to shed their  Blood neither should they have power to shed ours This principle president Young has taught from day to day when their was evry prospet that the Enemy would  try to come. From two to three thousand of the servants  of God armed themselves &amp; went into the mountains acco- rding to the council of President Young &amp; they were lead  by the valient &amp; Noble General Daniel H Wells to Hedge  up the way of the Enemy should they attempt to come in they formed large Entrenchments &amp; ditches &amp; pilled up large masses of Rocks in narrow passes so as to  roll them down upon the Enemy &amp; destroy them should they attempt to Come in. But as the Prophets Brigham  &amp; Heber had said so it came to pass the Lord fought  our Battles &amp; hedged up the way of our Enemies when  they Got on City the  storms &amp; cold killed their Horses, Mules, &amp; Cattle by Hun- dreds so that when the whole armey got together with  the Govornor &amp; Judges who had been sent by the  Government to rule &amp; tyranize over us they had not  got team enough left alive to draw one third of  their trains so they are obliege to stop &amp; spend the winter in the storms of the mountains &amp; their wisdom  is taken away so that they are not capable of writing  a letter or Document in a proper manner and this  the Lord has done in answer to the prayers of his Saints and our brethren have been enabled to Heard them like a herd of cattle &amp; they have shot grape musket &amp; minnie  balls at them from time to time &amp; those Balls have flown  like hail around the servants of God &amp; not a drop of  Blood shed neither have the Brethren returned the  fire upon the Enemy in no instance. Fear has so rested  upon the Enemy that they would flee into their main body  at the approach of a small number of our Brethren &amp; thus has the Lord Frustrated the Enemy in all their designs   ENDENTRY  against us up to this day &amp; through this whole sceneery of  alarm of war &amp; the approach of the Enemy President Young  has been as calm &amp; scerene as a Mays summers morning and all the time has said victory would be hours &amp; that Blood would not be shed &amp; he has diffused ^this same spirit^ throughout the whole Church &amp; kingdom of God esstablished in these mounta- ins and all the armies of Zion have gone out to war as  calm &amp; composed as though they were going into the field to their daily labour &amp; now the Armies are returning out of the mountains of snow to their homes with the same spirit of composure &amp; quietude as they went out thanking God that the words of the prophets have been  fullfilled in their behalf &amp; as they pass  of President Young they give him a quiet salute &amp; pass  on in silence to their homes  passing Army of Zion with a Heart filled to overflowing  with thanksgiving &amp; praise to the God of Israel who had  fulfilled his words which he had been inspired by the  Holy Ghost to utter unto his brethren &amp; was also thankful  that He was surrounded with Brethren who were servants  of God &amp; were united to gether in faith &amp; love to carry  out his instruction &amp; thereby claim the protection &amp;  Blessings of Almighty God upon them, as He walks through the city under the sable shades of night he beholds &amp;  feels the diferent between the Army of Zion &amp; the camp of  the wicked. Hundreds of men who have just returned from the Armey of Israel in the mountains arive in the city in  two months in the mountains of cold &amp; snow not a  murmer is heard to escape their lips, or the sound of  Blasphemy, or oath, or filthy language, or contention  one with an other.

Brother Wells said that Brother Maxfield had the command  of a small scouting party they took a horse from the Enemy &amp;  was fired at by the Enemy, but no one hurt they went back to  their encampment. Brother Maxfield had an impression that  their was Danger in their path and ought to leave their camp He told his Brethren so but some of them did not think so &amp;  all went to Bed But these feelings increasing upon Brother  Maxfield He arose from his bed &amp; told his Brethren He was  agoing to leave that place immediately &amp; they all gathered  up their Horses and went several Miles Back &amp; camped for  the night &amp; soon the Encampment which they had Just  left was surrounded by a Hundred men &amp; had it not been  for their warning they would probably have been all  taken prisioners. President Young said concerning the  Enemy I know they will begin to waste away before spring  and I think they will get orders to return back. If they  attempt to come in Col Johnson will ride the best Horse He can  get &amp; will say to Col Cook &amp; the other officers now you go ahead now you had better all get killed than to loose  your next president thinking that He would stand a chance to be President.    &amp; preached to a large congregation was followed by D Spencer  &amp; E Snow.

Many an hour has Joseph spent in gloom and sorrow because of Fals Brethren and wicked men, even the hearts of the saints were so barred by fals tradition that He  could not unbosom his soul in the House of his Friends. This caused him pain. Then thou dist comfort him.

In the remarks which I made I said I did not think  their ever was an Assembly of men on Earth that deliberated  upon so weighty a subject upon which hung such important  consequences with the same feeling which pervades the boso- ms of this assembly. for all that we possess in this life inclu- ding all our lives are couched in this important subjet yet  evry mind is calm and serene and not a disenting vote or  voice, why is this, when Our Fathers set in solumn  convention upon the subject of our Declaration of Independance  they knew well that their cause was just, yet it required  the strongest talent and argumet and language was exherted  to bring that august body of senators to agree as a unit  in putting their names to that sacred instrument; ^the^ speech  of sir Patrick Henry was a masterly Effort of talent  &amp; oritory upon that solumn occasion. It does not require  any argument with this body of men to convince them what  course to persue, what causes this difference they were  inspired by the Lord to step forth to esstablish an  Independant Government in America, but this body of  Men are far more inspired by the same God to esstablish  the Kingdom of God upon the Earth and lay a foundation  for the Liberty and salvation of our children and to  lift up a standard for the oppressed of all nations  Our path is marked out as plain  street or the missippi who inspired our Fathers to esstablish a Free government said through the prophet Joseph Smith that if ever the constitu- tion of the United States or its principles were ever preserved  it would have to be done by the Church of Jesus Christ of  Latter Day Saints even the servants of God Holding the Holy  priesthood. that day has now come &amp; the day is dawning when  we are called to act the same God who has destroyed two  Nations who have dwelt upon this continent because of  their iniquity, has also said that all other Nations who  should occupy this continant when they were ripened in  iniquity should in like manner be cut off from the earth and not left to pollute the Land of Joseph or the Land of Zion I do not know what Els our Nation can do in order in order to fill up their cup of iniquity than what they  have done and are doing.
