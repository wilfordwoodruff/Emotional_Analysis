We got word this morning from  FIGURE the Hand Cart company that they will camp to night at killions  at the foot of the Little Mountain many of them are frozen their  fingers and toes are droping off and flesh droping off their bones it has been vary  bad management in starting out Companies so late upon the plains. Brothe  Decker came in last night He brought in the express He says that the ox trains  cannot even get to Bridger they sent in for 40 tons of flour the cattle are  dying and also the people there has never been so much suffering among any  people as their is this season it is truly deploriable.

I called upon  President Young at his office He had been down to lay hands upon  president J. M. Grant who lay vary low his lungs appeared to fill and  no power to raise any thing from his Lungs it appeared as though he  could not live but a short time unless there was a change soon for  the better. He said he felt as though He wanted an apple some  grapes or wine or sumthing upon his subject stomach President  young sent him down some and they rosted an apple and he eat it about  12 oclok and seemed to relish it well He also drank some butter milk  which he relished well. but it seemed to be sumthing like a death Apetite  FIGURE The missionaries met at the Historians office soon President Young  came in and opened the meeting with prayer F. D. Richards made a  short report or address and was followed by W. Woodruff who  expresedsed his feelings in great plainness concerning this people taking off  from the president a part of the burthen which is resting upon him  for he was wearing out. Then all the Missionaries who was sent to the  different wards were Called upon to report and all made their report  and spoke incourageingly of the refermation the meeting held till 10 oclok F. D. Richards and myself started down to see how President Grant was  I met Dr S. L. Sprague who informed  me that He was dead had  Just breathed his last we  immediately went into the  House and found his wives and  Children weeping bitterly FIGURE President  Jedediah Morgan Grant  Died Dec 1st 1856; 20 minuts past 10 oclok PM  Aged 40 years 9 months and 7 days. George Davisson Grant and Dotctors  S L Sprague Dunyon was standing around his body  as I gazed upon his claye Tabernacle without his spirit I felt to  exclaim A mighty man in Zion is laid low A valiant man in Israel  has fallen I felt that a great champeon in the kingdom of God was taken   ENDENTRY from us we felt his loss deeply for two months it seems as though he had been  hurried to close up his work He has been preaching for several months calling upon the people to repent his voice has been like the Trump of the Angel of  God and he has laboured night and day untill He was laid prostrate with sickness  He has shot the arrows of the Almighty with great power among the people.  He Called at the Historians office on the 19th Nov the last time He was out. He  was then sick. He was confined to his house 10 days before he died He had  a great vision while He was sick which he told to the brethren he preached  nearly all the time that He was sick and he related all that he saw in the spirit  world   Soon after I entered his house his wife Rosetta was seized with  great trembling and nervous excitement and it seemed as though her frame would shake  to peices we lade hands upon her and rebuked the Devil which seemed to sieze her  tabernacle and she became more calm.   I assisted Dr Dunyon in laying out the body of Brother Grant I spent the night with him    ENDENTRY December 2, 1856 ~ Tuesday   2nd I left Brother Hooper  found him quite sick I administered unto him then I went to my house got  a piece of fine linen and Mrs Woodruff accompanied me to Brother Grants  I gave them the linen to make a garment and Robes to lay out the body in. I  went to President Zina Young to go down and help make the  Robes she gave me a seat President Young came in and spoke of Brother  Grants Death said we had done all we could to save his life but the  powers the other side of the veil were stronger than we were and he was wanted  there. Sister Zina Young walked with me to President Grants and spent the day with the sisters in makeing the robes. I felt sick and went home and went  to bed and was sick through the day. Filmore today    ENDENTRY December 3, 1856 ~ Wednesday   3rd I spent most of the day writing the Obituary of J. M. Grant    ENDENTRY December 4, 1856 ~ Thursday   3rd4th FIGURES At 9 oclok preperations were made for the Funeral of J. M. Grant The doors of the House was flung open for the people to visit the corps many  thousands went through the House to visit the body at half past 9 the Military  began to form in open lines from the residence to the Tabernacle 3 bands of  Music were in attendance. The Lieutenant General and staff, General Grant staff and  Lancers were in attendance and a company of York masons formed in the posse  procession the corps was removed to the tabernacle and the House filled up  and many that could not get in. But it took so long to get through  with the ceremonies of the Morning that it was 10 minuts to 12 oclok when  President Brigham Young arose to speak as it was so late He did not  speak but a short time and said He did not answered his mind but his  remarks were vary interesting and instructive at the close of the meeting  the procession was formed and the corps conveyed to the grave followed  by the largest procession ever formed on such an occasion in this  valley. at the Grave President Young made some remarks He said  we have no cause to mourn for Brother Grant and you have made  a far greater display here than was necessary for more so than  Brother Grant would have wished and a far greater display than  I wish you to make over my body when I die Brother Grant  is well off and He has lived more in advancement and far riper for  Eternity in 40 years than many would in a Hundred when I die  I ownly want you to let my body rest in the grave I want to be buried decently  but I do not wish any great Display at my funeral let your flags lie still  and all your military display. I hope the body of Brother Grant may lie here  undisturbed thill till the resurrection I see the warm feelings of the  people for Brother Grant. it is cold let the people go home and let the bearers stay  and see the grave filled up properly. The procession then returned to the House  during the evening I called upon Brother Grants family I then attended  meeting in the 14th ward. I was some unwell. I spoke a short time   ENDENTRY December 5, 1856 ~ Friday   5th I spent most of the day at home I was unwell    ENDENTRY December 6, 1856 ~ Saturday   6th I spent the fore part of the day in the office I attended meeting of  the Bishop and council and priesthood of the 14th ward at 2 oclock F. D. Richards was present. I sat and herd the report of the Bretheren and when I  FIGURE was requested to speak by Bishop Hoagland I arose and said  that as Bishop Hoagland and the missionaries had appointed  Men as teachers to the gentile stores to preach the gospel to them  But the spirit said to me it was not wisdom to send men to preach  the gospel to them I considered they were wicked and corrupt and  it was like casting pearls before swine when I closed F. D. Richards  Backed me and up and bore testimony that I said was true. Then Bishop  Hoagland arose and opposed me vary strongly and said He presided over the  14 ward and had sent the Teachers to preach to the Gentiles and he wished  them to go and do it I at once saw the gentiles were devil had ensnared  him when He sat down the Teacher arose and said what shall I  do Brother Woodruff says do not go to those Gentiles Bishop Hoagland  says go. I arose and said to the teachers obey your Bishop for He says he will take the responsibility upon himself in sending teachers  to them many of the Priesthood were fired up upon the subject  but the meeting closed and we went home At about 5 oclok the  Calafornia mail came in and Brother Richards and myself went up  to Presidents Youngs we related to him what had taken place with us and Bishop Hoagland President Young was asstonished at the position  which Brother Hoagland had taken He said the devil was leading  him into dificulty which he could not extricate himself without  Help. He immediately sent for Bishop Hoagland who came up and the  subject was all talked over and President Young showed him his  Error and he saw it President Young told him that the Twelve held the keys of the Kingdom of God in all the world where  the presidency are not, and that No Bishop presided over any  one of the Twelve in any place the Bishop Made his confession  and went home we santt a while and read Letters and papers   several were received from Elder Hyde    ENDENTRY December 7, 1856 ~ Sunday   7th Sunday I attended meeting in the Edward Martin and Wm  Clough Preached in the afternoon I Attended the prayer  Circle. Heard the Letters read from Elders Hyde and others  Elder Orson Hyde calls for 100 more men thinks there will be  a prospect of a fight with the Calafornians. President Young  said He wished all the men were at home and that Elder Hyde  was at home in his store and that He would not take any  Mission while he lived for He had lost the spirit of his  office and was of no account. It made the President feel  sorrowful to see the Twelve and others not feel the spirit of their  office. At the close of the meeting I went home and with my  family went to the 14 ward meeting in the Music Hall I was  much pressed in spirit. After listening to the speeches of Brothers  Hunt, Candland, and Pack I was requested to speak I arose upon my  Feet though heavily pressed in spirit yet the spirit of God was in my tabernacle like fire shut up in my bones and I spoke to the people  FIGURE about 3/4 of an hour and I scearsly knew whether I was in the body  or out of it neither can I remember but little what I said, the following  is are some of the remarks which I made while the House was as still as  the House of Death while the spirit of God filled the House.   ENDENTRY Brethren and sisters I arise to say a few words to you But I am pressed in spirit  and I can say as I have heard Brother Joseph say while smiteing upon his  breast I would to God I could unbosom my feelings in the house of my friends,  but I do not expect to do it but in a small degree for my mind is open in  vision of things which I cannot utter or speak unto you for it is not  lawful or expedient if I had the ability to do so. I am pained in spirit as I  see the Bishop and council and teachers and missionaries labouring, toiling, rebuking and  pounding the people trying to removeing the darkness and fog which hangs  over this City and the 14th ward. But let me say to the Bishop and teachers and missio naries before me to night to go to work and search deeply your own hearts and get  the spirit of the living God upon you remove the fog and darkness from your  own minds and then you can see clearly to remove the darkness from the minds  of the people. The priesthood need the spirit of God in order to know how to deal  with the people and save them for when you knock the people in the Head in order to wake them, when they get awake you should not still pound them untill you  kill them. but get a Fatherly feeling and try to save them. Some of the teachers  when they go through the ward to teach the people they get the big head and  do not know ^how^ to treat the people. it is not nessary to stand here and jump  and shout and stomp off 50 cts worth of sole leather in order to get the people  to wake up or reform but it is a straight forward business matter to reform  whare any one has stolen or done wrong in any thing let them return what  they have taken and make restitution. It is a momentious time in Israel and it is necessary for this refermation in order to have the people prepared for the  great things of God which are comeing upon the Earth and upon this people  the line will be drawn and scenes will take place which will try mens  souls and I warn all men and women before me this night that they do not  make light of the things of the Kingdom of God or of this refermation  for destruction is nigh the doors of such as do it and I warn our young  Brethren and Sisters that they humble themselves before God and give heed to the  words of Eternal Life listen to the council of the Bishop and Missionaries and  teachers among you for if you despise the council of God and his servants  judgment will come upon you and destress and anguish will be upon you. The  Lord is calling loudly upon this people to repent and do the works of righteousness  and Live your religin remember the Testimony of Brother Grant the testator  is dead but the testiment is in force his hard labours to awaken this  people have cost him his life He has laid down his body in the grave  I made many other remarks while the fire and power of the Holy Ghost  was burning within me. At the close of the meeting I called the Bishop  and priesthood to gether and gave them instruction concerning the wrong cours  Bishop Hoagland had taken with me I taught them the order of the  Priesthood Bishop Hoagland was humble and made all necessary satisfaction    ENDENTRY December 8, 1856 ~ Monday   8th I spent most of the day in the office at night I attended the  meeting of the Missionaries and Bishops. Presidents Kimball were  present also W. Woodruff and F D Richards of the Twelve    W Woodruff arose and called the Names of the Bishops and Missionaries most  of which answered to their names. F. D. Richards opened By Prayer and singing W. Woodruff arose and said I feel as though I want to say a few word it has seemed good unto the Lord to call a portion of us through  the mouth of his servants to go forth unto the inhabitants of this  City to preach the gospel of salvation and repentance unto the people, we  have met each week to give a report of our procedings but have not here to fore been associated with the Bishops in our meeting  I stand connected with you as a missionary and realize that those  who have assembled here this evening should stand as the candle and  light of the Lord. I have never felt more responsibility resting   ENDENTRY upon me than at present God has an object in sending us to preach  the gospel of Repentance to the people and so had the servants of the Lord who  sent us forth. I feel that it is necessary to purify ourselves and get  the spirit of God before we can properly go forth to preach to the people  if we will get the darkness and fog from ourselves we can take it  From the people and the Elements will be Clear. I feel to purify myself I  have felt the spirit of God resting upon me of Late and I feel that there  is great things awaiting us. The Presidency of this church has  had the Head Heart and soul ake for a long time it has  caused their hearts to ake to see the Apostles and Elders of this church  who bear the priesthood forget their calling and turn from the work  of God unto Folly and have their hearts set upon the things of the world we may use the sledge hammer to much but we should be right  ourselves when we reprove others. The Bishops and Missionaries in  some instances have manifested a feelings for the mastery to know  who should be the greatest but they would not have this feeling if  they had the spirit of God. The Business of the Missionaries is  to call upon the people to repent and live their religion and the Bishops should unite with them in the spirit of God to carry out this Great  work. How Long shall we see the Presidency of this Church weighed  down to the Earth with a Burthen which the Elders and people should  bear. Aris up ye Bishops and missionaries and put on the whole armor  of God and the people will live their religion when you live it yours  yourselves then the burthen will begin to lighten upon the presidency  some time when we sharply rebuke the people we are not right ourselves thies things are true. It is time we arose in the spirit and power  of our calling and help bear the burthen that is resting upon the shoulders  of Presidents Kimball. No man could live with the  Load resting upon him that is now upon the head of those men  unless he was nerved up and sustained Daily by the hand and power  of God. I feel brethren that there is sumthing important awaiting  us. The more I humble myself before God and get the Holy Ghost the  more my heart is drawn out towards the presidency of this  Church I have never seen the day in my life when I have  felt to prize the society and council of those men as I do at the  present time, this people have not prized them and their teaching  as they ought and if they do not more appreciate their labour  and keep their council better than they have done they will  be taken from us. Brethren lay aside all your selfish feelings  and you will see that God will be with us let us wake up ourselves  and then the people not for this winter ownly but let the refermation  last during our lives. Presidents Young and Kimball are present  and I would like to hear them teach and council us this evening but  I presume they feel as though they had taught us so long and so much  which we have not improved upon that they feel discouraged in teaching us, and think we ought to know how to walk aright But  I do not wish to occupy your time the spirit says I should close  May God Bless you Amen    President Young sung "O Happy souls who pray" then said  Brother Woodruff has given us a good testimony a Living testimony  in the spirit and power of the Holy Ghost. Now any of the rest of  you who have the Holy Ghost arise and speak to us those things which  will Edify. E. D. Woolley then spoke a Few moments  then President Young arose and spoke to the people the following  is a synopsis of his remarks as I reported them all Brother Kimball   ENDENTRY President Young arose and said. I dont expet to speak much to night  I have learned to governed myself in talking as well as in other things  it may be asked if this is a new work it is not a new work but our  refermation is the work we begun in when we embraced the gospel. I  have pointed out the Errors of the people all the time and shown the people ther  faults and told them what to do but here is the difficulty as soon as the Elders  come home from their missions in a few days they lay down their Armour  while they should keep oit on all the time and keep it bright but their minds  are engrossed with the things of the world and lie down and go to sleep their ownly  ambition is to know how they can get this House built or a farm, Horses  cattle andc, their whole soul is in the work of the world not the building of  the Kingdom of God but any man that gets property upon this principle  it will carode him he has not wisdom to use it. I have told the people  a hundred times they do not know how to get rich. The way for the  people to get rich is to do the will of God and they must be governed by the  Revelations and spirit of God. Brother Woodruff has told us here to night  how it is when I look upon the conduct of the people before the refer mations commenced as I was teaching them the way of salvation daily  and they would not give heed to it pained my heart and I felt as if I  should die but when Brother Jedediah M Grant steped forward  and took the Burthen off from me I was relieved But it has cost  him his life Had he not have taken that burthen upon him he would  have lived a few Years longer in our midst. I have felt that unless  this people would awake and live their religion I must go down to  the grave But the burthen of this people was taken from me and rested  upon him and it has not yet returned to me although he is dead should  it return to me as it has been I shall soon follow him to the grave  for I could not live long with that wait upon me. When you first  recieved the gospel did ^was^ not your heart filled with love and you put on the gospels armour and would it not have continued with you all the time if you had lived your religion all the time but you have had bad  feelings in your Breast and against your Neighbour but if the spirit of  God had continued with you it would have overcome those evil  feelings and what if we were all to put our armour off and partook  of the spirit of anger and Hatred God would spue us out of his mouth  and we would go down to hell together and He would raise up another  people to do his will. After all the stuper that has rested upon this  people they have been gaping for more revelation I do not mean one  man but I mean the whole people while they have already a great deal  more than they are worthy off and if this people do not wake up and  live their religion The Lord will take away the sources of revelation  which they now have from the people, it is not a few men that have  got to live their religion but it is this whole community. If we as  a people will return unto the Lord I know he will receive us with  open arms. I am glad that this winter has commenced without  Fidling and danceing. But would their be any harm in going into the  Hall and haveing a dance if we felt right and kept the spirit of God with  us, No there would not. But as soon as we should open this door  how many would keep the armour on and live their religion and keep  the spirit of God not many, some would but many would say come  let us go and take a drink and begin to get the liquor in them and then they would  say come Brother Brigham I am ready for any thing stand out  of the way here Hurrah for Hell sware a little Dam a little steal a  little gamble a little, and raise the Devil. But we will stop Fidling and  danceing untill the Brethren get power to overcome these things and keep  them under their feet. I do not intend to start danceing again untill the   ENDENTRY people will learn to do right, and live their religion. I have to war with the  weakness of man I am incompassed with it, I know what it is to fight it all the time. If you are going to continue a refermation make up your mind  to live your religion. If the people will do this it will be as Brother Woodruff  says the darkness will pass away and I can live long among this people and  so can brother Kimball and other men But if this people will go on lieing  stealing swearing and whoreing I do not want to live but I want to leave  the people and go to God and let the wicked go to Hell I hope that God will send the wicked that will not repent ^go^ down to hell quickly and be burned up  that they may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus. When I first came into  this church I was an Enthusiast and thought I would never keep an account  never put pen to paper nor never say this or that was mine but it is the  Lords we never can be of one heart and one mind untill we can say that all  we have is the Lords and that we are ^ownly^ his servants and stewards to controll it according to his will. When the Lord gives me property He gives me wisdom to use it.   We have individual rights and shall have to all Eternity. what are those rights  If I have any property Horses Cattle waggons or any thing Els my neighbor  has no right to stell it from me. and if the people have the spirit of the  Lord they would know that it was not right to take any thing which belonged  to another without liberty but let it remain whare it is. we are accounting  for our time to the Lord now if you have a months leasure time and you gamble that away and do not bring to pass any good you might just as well throw  away $20 and you are accountable for this waste of time. I am often  asstonished at the folly of this people many women are asking their  husbands for some new thing they want a dozen new Dresses and many  unnecessary things but does a person want of Doz new Dresses if this  people would ask for those things which are necessary and do right you would  soon see the people get rich. but what are you doing? are you rich No. the  Lord can send the grasshoppers Crickets and Locust they are his Armies and can  Eat us up and kill our Cattle He can give us much or little as He pleases  If our eyes are single to the glory of God and we do our duty the Lord  could make us as rich as Cesar what would do with it aggrandize  yourselves, no you should not, but send out millions of men to gather  the poor and send men with mules loaded with gold to buy the Nations  but now we are poor and we can comparitively do but little. Now I am here with  Brother Kimball If you wish to ask any question we can answer right but  for me to teach the Bishops there duty it is folly for I have taught them  over and over for years. Now if I was going to a ward meeting to preach  and the bishop was to oppose me unless it was my duty to reprove him I  should sit and laugh at him but not contend with him. But when their is any  difficulty between a missionary and Bishop or any two men they should not  contend about it before the people but talk it over among themselves  and settle all diference of opinion in the spirit of God and not labour for  the mastery   President H. C. Kimball followed and said I am one with President  J. M. Grant He took hold of the work to wake up the people  with all his might and it killed him. If President Young was to ask me  to go forth in the safme way I would do it but it would cut short my  life as it did his. I have never felt as though Jedediah was dead  the saviour said those that abide in me will never die his spirit is  with us and he can do more for us now than he could before. The spirit of God is poured out upon some men mightily. The refermation is doing good  and the people are doing better and those who get the spirit of God will stand  and those who do not will fall. The people are forsaking their sins   ENDENTRY Oct 28 wants tohem to go north south or East He will have it Just as He wants and this I am thankful for and I feel perfectly easy about it all. You will find when the Lord sees that  we are willing to fight and get Just ready to shoot that He will  fight our battles. He said G. A. Smith may stop in the city  this time let C C Rich go He is a good General and a wise man in calculation I recon a good deal upon him in the future Mrs Mogo was sent to the camp and Jones their waggon Master to day they have also sent back the waggon Master which they took prisioner they are sending in several  Teamsters, deserters, and one prisioner I spent the evening in the Office  ENDENTRY October 29, 1857 ~ Thursday   29th I spent a short time in the D H Wells left to day to again take command of the Expedition  in the mountains and the company of cavalry commanded by Heber Kimball also went out.

Brothers Groove and Southworth who had  been kept prisioners for some two weeks in the Enemies camp  arived home to day. Brother Grove called upon President Young and related what He knew in the Enemies camp I had a  conversation with Brother Southworth concerning his impri- sionment and He said that He was taken prisioner on Green  River by an officer in Capt Cooks Horse company and  put under Guard with orders for the guard to shoot him if  He got 5 paces from him He travelled under guard in this  way untill He got to the main Encampment He was then put  with the main prisioners of the camp and guarded with the mess He came up with Howard Livingston. He wished Mr Livingston  to intercede with Col Johnsoton to let him go home to his family  as they had nothing against him ownly that He was a Mormon But Mr Livingston would do nothing for him He reports that  their is much of the spirit of Desertion in the camp the  officers treat their soldiers in a cruel manner. Capt Cook  is considered a Cruel Tyrant and several of his soldiers said  ^said^ they would kill him if they had a chance, several soldiers  talked with southworth and said they would desert if they could. He said the greatest amount of any one article in camp  was ardent spirits He thought there were 100 waggon loads Howard Livingston had an outfit of Liquor which cost  him ten thousand dollars worth at first cost, and that all the  Armey had a great amount as well as all the Suttler's the officers  were drunk evry day. He said their was but 2 companies at Bridger  guarding that place and thought 100 men could go in the night and  take all their was in that Fort. they were 5 days moving their  train 6 miles they had not animals enough to move one third of their train at the same time and they lost 60 of their best  mueles while moving that distance. He says their is a division of  the officers as well as the soldiers a portion of them think  that Govornor Young is Justified in taking the course He does in  his own Defence. He said Col Allexander was an old Granny the Govornor Cummings was a whiskey tub, in appearance about such  a man as Brother Blazzard would be if He drank a quart of  whiskey per day. Their Animals are dying so fast that they  all expect to be on foot before next spring they have sent  capt Marcy to Taos to buy mules Horses and oxen the expedit- ion is entirely closed this season and made an Entire faleure  of it as far as they are concerned   Reflections   We can now clearly see the Hand of God made visably bear  in our behalf concerning the campaign of our Enemies against  us this season past. The American Government with James Bucannan  at their head as president, have sent forth An Armey  of 2,500 men fully armed and Equipt for war for the sole  purpose of destroying the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter  Day Saints and the Kingdom of God from off the Earth. This  Church and kingdom of God has been driven from the midst of the people in the United States into the vallies of the  Rocky Mountains a thousand miles from the confines   ENDENTRY o Dec 2nd  of what is called Gentile Civilization whare they were  in hopes we would perish but as soon as they found that  we would live and prosper they became alarmed and were  resolved upon our destruction and Hence they send their armies out to accomplish their Hellish purpose as soon  as it was known unto us President Brigham Young the  prophet seer and Revelator and leader of the Church and  kingdom of God Rose up in the strength of Israel God  and proclaimed Israel Free and said they should be  Free from that hour if they would obey his council  and follow his preceps. His councillors Heber C Kimball  and Daniel H Wells and also the Quorum of the Twelve  Apostles backed up his Testimony and sustained him in  his decissions And all the people said Amen so let it  be. President Young testified unto the people in the name  of God if they would be United with him in their faith  prayers and works that the Enemy Should not have  power to come into our valley that the Lord would hedge  up their way and we should not be called to shed their  Blood neither should they have power to shed ours This principle president Young has taught from day to day when their was evry prospet that the Enemy would  try to come. From two to three thousand of the servants  of God armed themselves and went into the mountains acco- rding to the council of President Young and they were lead  by the valient and Noble General Daniel H Wells to Hedge  up the way of the Enemy should they attempt to come in they formed large Entrenchments and ditches and pilled up large masses of Rocks in narrow passes so as to  roll them down upon the Enemy and destroy them should they attempt to Come in. But as the Prophets Brigham  and Heber had said so it came to pass the Lord fought  our Battles and hedged up the way of our Enemies when  they Got on City the  storms and cold killed their Horses, Mules, and Cattle by Hun- dreds so that when the whole armey got together with  the Govornor and Judges who had been sent by the  Government to rule and tyranize over us they had not  got team enough left alive to draw one third of  their trains so they are obliege to stop and spend the winter in the storms of the mountains and their wisdom  is taken away so that they are not capable of writing  a letter or Document in a proper manner and this  the Lord has done in answer to the prayers of his Saints and our brethren have been enabled to Heard them like a herd of cattle and they have shot grape musket and minnie  balls at them from time to time and those Balls have flown  like hail around the servants of God and not a drop of  Blood shed neither have the Brethren returned the  fire upon the Enemy in no instance. Fear has so rested  upon the Enemy that they would flee into their main body  at the approach of a small number of our Brethren and thus has the Lord Frustrated the Enemy in all their designs   ENDENTRY Dec 2nd against us up to this day and through this whole sceneery of  alarm of war and the approach of the Enemy President Young  has been as calm and scerene as a Mays summers morning and all the time has said victory would be hours and that Blood would not be shed and he has diffused ^this same spirit^ throughout the whole Church and kingdom of God esstablished in these mounta- ins and all the armies of Zion have gone out to war as  calm and composed as though they were going into the field to their daily labour and now the Armies are returning out of the mountains of snow to their homes with the same spirit of composure and quietude as they went out thanking God that the words of the prophets have been  fullfilled in their behalf and as they pass thby the Habitation  of President Young they give him a quiet salute and pass  on in silence to their homes Hewhile He gazes upon the passing Army of Zion with a Heart filled to overflowing  with thanksgiving and praise to the God of Israel who had  fulfilled his words which he had been inspired by the  Holy Ghost to utter unto his brethren and was also thankful  that He was surrounded with Brethren who were servants  of God and were united to gether in faith and love to carry  out his instruction and thereby claim the protection and  Blessings of Almighty God upon them, as He walks through the city under the sable shades of night he beholds and  feels the diferent between the Army of Zion and the camp of  the wicked. Hundreds of men who have just returned from the Armey of Israel in the mountains arive in the city in the city in the night, camp by the road side, have been two months in the mountains of cold and snow not a  murmer is heard to escape their lips, or the sound of  Blasphemy, or oath, or filthy language, or contention  one with an other. No one reeling under strong drink but kindness quietiude and Joy filles evry heart and the spirit of God fills evry bosom. This contrast is vary great when compared with the Gentile armies and cities   After I returned to my house and about to return to rest I heard a nock at my door I Bid the visiter come in when Brother Robert Scholes appeared my hiered  man He had been in the mountains two months with  my Horses in the Army He started at midnight the  night before and had traveled all the latter part of the  night and through the day, many of the men had given out  and the horses had to draw a heavy load of them    ENDENTRY December 3, 1857 ~ Thursday   3rd This is Fast day I attended meeting at the 14th ward school house a part of the day and spoak to the people a short  time I told them the Lord had fulfilled the words of President Brigham Young by stoping our enemies and not giving them power to come in without our sheding their Blood or they sheding ours the Lord had fought our Battles andc. I spent the  evening in the office   ENDENTRY December 4, 1857 ~ Friday   Dec 4th 1857 The Calafornia Mail arived last evening we find from the Calafornia papers that the massacre of the Emigrants in  the south by the Indians is laid to the mormons the people in  Loss Angel held public meeting and passed Resolutions to call on  the President of the United States to exhert his power to bring the murderers to Justice all the saints in Calafornia  are returning home Brother Cannon got out a half sheet  of the Standard their is quite a stir concerning Mormon- ism.

Wells in the  afternoon. I spoke and was Followed By Professor Albert Carrington reporters took notes I Attended a meeting of the prayer circle John Taylor opened by Prayer and D H Wells was mouth in the  circle. Brother Wells said that Brother Maxfield had the command  of a small scouting party they took a horse from the Enemy and  was fired at by the Enemy, but no one hurt they went back to  their encampment. Brother Maxfield had an impression that  their was Danger in their path and ought to leave their camp He told his Brethren so but some of them did not think so and  all went to Bed But these feelings increasing upon Brother  Maxfield He arose from his bed and told his Brethren He was  agoing to leave that place immediately and they all gathered  up their Horses and went several Miles Back and camped for  the night and soon the Encampment which they had Just  left was surrounded by a Hundred men and had it not been  for their warning they would probably have been all  taken prisioners. President Young said concerning the  Enemy I know they will begin to waste away before spring  and I think they will get orders to return back. If they  attempt to come in Col Johnson will ride the best Horse He can  get and will say to Col Cook and the other officers now you go ahead now you had better all get killed than to loose  your next president thinking that He would stand a chance to be President.   I accompanied Brother Woolley to his ward  and preached to a large congregation was followed by D Spencer  and E Snow. I spoke upon the kingdom of God now esstablished, and its finally distiny. D Spencer spoke of our Educating our Children and E Snow  of Family Government said some men would deal honorably with Brigham Young and cheat their nearest Neighbor.

What I have to say I speak right on without any regard to the Poets measure  or rhyme, or law, or order; Thou hast spread thy thoughts on Paper for men to read: I have read them many an  hour, they have stired my soul with thoughts, deep thoughts, thoughts which could not be born. Thy soul hath been  inspired with the spirit of God, and Eternal light and truth  and Noble sentiment and God has given thee gifts to utter them. Thy lamp hath been lit at Gods Holy altar whare  the oil was pure and the spirit free so thou couldst weigh Eternal truth and tell it unto men. Why hath this talent  this choice gift been given unto thee Eliza. Ah the spirit whispers it was to cheer the heart of aA Prophet A Patriarch, An Apostle in the dark hours of Gloom. It was to give the Lords Anointed a ray of light, and a consoleing thought while Hells dark Billows  rolled around in the midst of wicked men and Devils who continually cry out and say that no kingdom on the Earth shall belong  to God. FIGURE It was to tell the assassins of Illinois  in streams of Living fire that the Judgments of God awaited their guilty souls and that there Judgment had begun. It was to tell the wicked Nation who now Pollute the sacred soil of  Joseph that when their cup was full they would find a  grave there to remain untill called to Judgment by the trump  of God. Hast thou not been faithful in thy mission to Earth. Yes the spirit whispers Yes. Many an hour has Joseph spent in gloom and sorrow because of Fals Brethren and wicked men, even the hearts of the saints were so barred by fals tradition that He  could not unbosom his soul in the House of his Friends. This caused him pain. Then thou dist comfort him. Thy frendly thoughts and acts and words inspired by Gods Eternal truth was like a flaming shaft though launch by a female hand, that hand was nerved by faith and power that it pierced the walls of Darkness fear and death and gave the Prophet Joy. But who can tell the best deeds of a true friend in time of need, None They are not told in time, but like gold in the mine are  concealed from vhuman view, if known at all the Judgment must reveal them. Thou hast been a true Friend and com- forted the Heart of Joseph, Willard, Lorenzo and thousands of the saints I need  not name them. Thy words and testimony will live and speak in flames of Holy fire to inspire the Hearts of Prophets Apos- tles and Holy men of God to noble Deeds, and steal steel the nerve  of many a Noble Son of Zion. to avenge the Blood of the Prophets  and martyrs of Jesus Christ, long after thou art with thy Father in heaven clothed with Immortality and crowned with Light Thy Pen hath pierced many a wicked withheart with barbed  darts which no Earthly power could remove. Thou hast freely told the wicked their doom and warned them of approaching Judgment. Thy garment are clear of the Blood of all men.   ENDENTRY Thy testimony will remain on histories page and be  numbered among the prophets of God as one of the noble spirits whom God has sent through the Loins of Abraham and Joseph to fulfill a Noble mission upon the Earth in the last dispensation  and fulness of times. God Bless Thee Noble Muse. Thy soul is as pure as the criystleal stream that flows from its snowy  bed. Out of the Heart the mouth speaketh. The thoughts of  thy soul are before the world to read Let them read. It will  live when they are Dead. Continue to let the inspiration  of thy soul be given unto men. Haste thy mission here upon  Earth. For Eloheam, Jehovah, Michael Angels seraphs Apostles  Prophets Thy Mother Brethren and sisters await thy  coming with Joy. Thou hast been true and faithful and  art sealed unto Eternal life and secured unto thyself a Crown  of glory. No Power shall take it. It awaits thy coming Soon this Blessing will be thine. Ah what Joy what consolation who can comprehend it None but a saint. Soon will thou Enjoy  this Blessing. Did I say soon, Yes not because I expet thee to leave us. But shouldst thou remain to see Zion Redeemed (which ma^y^ God grant) and her Enemies conquered and sin and  sinners find a grave, and Zions Land be cleansed and the  Jackson County be reared, clothed with  the Power of God, with her towreers marked with a pillar of fire by night and a cloud by day, And the way prepared for the coming  of the Son of Man, it will be soon.

Resolutions were offerd upon the merits of the Govornors  Message which resolutions were like a Declaration of independance  against wicked and ungodly men this drew speeches from John Taylor  J. C. Litle W W Phelps andc many interesting remarks were made G A. Smith  said it was a grave question before us and one of vast import  if we carry out these resolutions we may prepare our necks  for the Halter if our Enemies catch us I am in for the measure  because it is right the United States are determined to destroy  the Mormons if it is in their power but we have to defend our- selves. In the remarks which I made I said I did not think  their ever was an Assembly of men on Earth that deliberated  upon so weighty a subject upon which hung such important  consequences with the same feeling which pervades the boso- ms of this assembly. for all that we possess in this life inclu- ding all our lives are couched in this important subjet yet  evry mind is calm and serene and not a disenting vote or  voice, why is this, when Our Fathers set in solumn  convention upon the subject of our Declaration of Independance  they knew well that their cause was just, yet it required  the strongest talent and argumet and language was exherted  to bring that august body of senators to agree as a unit  in putting their names to that sacred instrument; ^the^ speech  of sir Patrick Henry was a masterly Effort of talent  and oritory upon that solumn occasion. It does not require  any argument with this body of men to convince them what  course to persue, what causes this difference they were  inspired by the Lord to step forth to esstablish an  Independant Government in America, but this body of  Men are far more inspired by the same God to esstablish  the Kingdom of God upon the Earth and lay a foundation  for the Liberty and salvation of our children and to  lift up a standard for the oppressed of all nations  Our path is marked out as plain asto our view as is our broad  street or the missippii River to the natural Eye. The same God who inspired our Fathers to esstablish a Free government said through the prophet Joseph Smith that if ever the constitu- tion of the United States or its principles were ever preserved  it would have to be done by the Church of Jesus Christ of  Latter Day Saints even the servants of God Holding the Holy  priesthood. that day has now come and the day is dawning when  we are called to act the same God who has destroyed two  Nations who have dwelt upon this continent because of  their iniquity, has also said that all other Nations who  should occupy this continant when they were ripened in  iniquity should in like manner be cut off from the earth and not left to pollute the Land of Joseph or the Land of Zion I do not know what Els our Nation can do in order in order to fill up their cup of iniquity than what they  have done and are doing.

I reason upon it thus that it being an Eye tooth  and taking cold water into my mouth before the goum had closed the water chilled the nerve runing from the thooth through the Eye  to the Brain and the cold Blood was instantly carried to the  Brain which created a concussion which was both excruciating  and dangerous had the water been warm instead of cold no such effect would have been produced.
