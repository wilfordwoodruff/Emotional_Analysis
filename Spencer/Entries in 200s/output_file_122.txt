 Elder W. W Woodruff  Thanked God that he had lived to see  a Presbyterian Meeting House filled with the Latter Day Saints  and the Pulpit occupied with the Apostles of the Lamb.  The Mothers  of Israel are to bear a royal people.  Instructed the little boys to  seek truth and rigtheousnes. They are to bear off this Kingdom 
 Elder W. Woodruff Remarked that we  are in a great school, the principals of  which are numerous & important  We should prize our liberty, our priviledges,  the gospel of life and salvation, the holy  priesthood, the living oracles, the  written word, and the promise of  eternal life. We should labor to build  up the Kingdom of God,  to overcome  the world, the flesh and the Devil  The more of the spirit of God a person  has the more they are like Him.    We are under obligations before the  Lord to live so as to possess enough  of the Holy spirit to keep his com-  mandments and the counsels given  to us by His servants 
 Elder Wilford Woodruff Has always re-  joiced in the Gospel. Spoke of his early  conversion to the truth of the Latter day work.  Was Baptized immediately after hearing it.  Encouraged the saints with a lengthy and vig  orous appeal, to live honestly and truthfully  with each other and their God, that they may   enjoy life Eternal. 
 Elder W. W Woodruff.  We as as people occupy a po-  sition now that we are acknowledged by all men  to be a living fact.  We are in Zion, and are learning  its praticle workings.  The Prophets of old saw it  in its purity and glory, but the mnutia of build-  ing it up is to be revealed day by day, as circum  stances develop themselves.  We have the promise that  this Zion will never be thrown down.  We are the only  people upon the earth who are preparing for the com-  ing of the Son of Man.  There is not a place we have  dedicated to God, but what is held sacred unto God.  And we shall have to rebuild the waste places.  God has  a willing people and although we have labored thirty  eight years, Zion is not built up to attract the gaze  and admiration of the nations.  The word of wisdom is  now a commandment with ^for^  us to keep.  Spoke of the great  number of evil spirits that are in existence: probably  seventy to each person on the earth.  Without revelation  we could not do any thing as Latter Day Saints.  The future  is glorious, if we are obedient, to the counsels of Gods  servants upon the earth. 
 Elder W. W. Woodruff. We have covenanted to serve  God, Keep his commandments, and proclaim his gos  pel to the children of men. Much is crowded into  this generation dispensation, more is required of us  than any other. The Elders of to day have traveled a thousand  miles to where the Elders of Jesus traveled one. Many of the   Apostals who laid the foundation of this church, have pass  ed away. Bro H. C Kimball's testimony is now in force  with us. He was a great Prophet a man of integrity:  is now resting in peace. We know but little about  the laws in the spirit world, whether the spirits are  around about us or not. We do not prize our bless-  ings our Prophets until they are gone. Refered to the  success of the Missionaries in the southern States. Those  who keep the Celestial Law will recive a celestial sal-  vation. We do not live up to the Revelations we have  now received. Bro Heber is now visiting with Joseph  Hyrum and the other faithful one who have gone before.  Those who apostatize will go down to hell,  and be angels to the Devil, and will regret in throughout all   Eternity. Let us live our religion. 
 Elder W Woodruff related some of this ex-  prience when the spirit of God alone sustained and di-  rected him. There never was a time when the saints  needed more of the spirit of the lord than at the  present. The work of the saints is to pepare a  place where Jesus can come and preside. After  laboring for thirty years will we sell our birth right  for a few goods? The Lord has kept His covenant  with us and has come out of His hiding place.  The nations are vexed by his fury. Many of the   Elders and High Priests of thirty years standing will  sustain the wicked in our midst. The spirit  says let them alone from this hour. 
 Elder W Woodruff. The two spirits had a war-  fare with the Prophet Joseph. The Devil tempted   him to obtain the plates for riches. The lives   of all the prophets and Apostles should give   us joy. Delighted to see the thousands of   children during the recent mission to   Sanpete. There is a great work before them   Desires that the saints will live their   religion, and be prepared for the coming   of the Son of Man. 
 Elder Wilford Woodruff. This is the greatest  day and generation that has ever been. Preach-  ing the gGospel, rebuilding of Jerusalem and  the coming of the Son of God. It required a vast   amount of faith in God, for the Elders to go forth  without purse or script, and establish the Gospel.  But the Latter Day Saints are a peculiar people.  We do live in a fast age, Gods and Men and   Devils. Every thing in Heaven, on Earth and in Hell  are in a hurry. Brigham Young is the Lords  mouth piece to this people. He is labouring to   build up Zion, agreeable to the decrees of the  Almighty. 
 Apostle Wilford Woodruff, unless we have the spirit  of God our Religion is a farce, in all ages of the world the devil  has harted the saints. It is a shame indeed that men in as great  possitions as Vice President and Legislators of this land should  seek to destroy the saints. We are all in the hands of God and  are perscecuted for our relegion, this is a wicked and lying  generation, the most of all other that have been on the face  of the earth. 50 years ago a murder was almost unknown  May we perform the work before us in a manner, acceptable  to God and all the Holy men that have gone before. 
 Elder W. Woodruff. There are but two churches upon the   earth, the church of God, and the church of the Devil.  we   have everything on our side to make us rejoice, God the   Hosts of heaven and the good and great Saints who have   passed before.  The dead are visiting the living to stir   them up to perform the necessary duties for the dead. This   nation are getting ripe for the wrath of God for he prom-  ised the wrath of God  the brother of Jared that none should  maintain it unless they served him, they have had a little   rebellion  warni[n]g in the recent rebellion and are to day divi-  ded and the most corrupt of all people that ever   lived upon the earth. Cooperation should have been   adopted 20 years ago, to keep the devil from us. 
 Page 1 from page 34 [of "An explanation of the Masonic Plate; showing the emblems of each degree from the entered apprentice to the Royal Arch or Five Orders of Masonry" by John Harris published in Bristol, England in 1839.]  Shall here add a little further on Masonry    King Solomon's officers appointed before he commanded  the work of the Temple. [##1 Kings 4:7-19##]    King Solomon appointed Deputy Grand Master  the Illustrious Tito prince Harodin, Senior Grand  warden; And the Noble prince Adoniram, Junior  grand warden [##1 Kings 4:1-6##]; the number of them employed, aranged,   and classed in every Department of this work was as  follows, The first, Harodin princes, Rulers or Provosts  three Hundred; Secondly, Mon Atzchism or overseers,  as the fifteen and comforters of the people in working  these were expert workmen & named by King Solomon  masters meaning mMasters over the workman to  the number of 3,300; thirdly Ghiblim, named Stone  Squarers, polishers and Sculptors, Hewers, Setters,  Layers & Builders, [##1 King 5##] those these were expert Fellowcrafts  80,000 the number of ^Free^ Masons employed in the work of  the temple, exclusive of the Two Grand Masters Wardens;  113,600, the men of burdens 70,000 not numbered as  Masons; in the quarries were 750 lod[g]es, each containing  one master, two wardens, & eleven times seven brethren,  which amount to 6,000 men; in the forest of Lebanon were  420 lodges, with the same number in each which 
 make 33,600; the levy out of Israel had always  20,000, at rest, and these sums make together 113,600,  The exact number employed at the work of the  temple, exclusive of the Ishsabbal, who were litterally  slaves to the workmen. It was 480 years after  the delivery of the children of Israel from their Egptian  bondage [##Exodus 15##], that Solomon laid the foundations stone  at the north east angle of the Temple on Mount Moriah [##2 Chronicles 3:1##]  one of the three hills of Jerusalem; they were employed  three years in preparing the materials for the  building for the Earth was raised 400 cubits, being  six hundred feet, in order to form it on a level  with the surface of the rock on which the building was  raised. Every [thing] being prepared, King Solomon, on the   Fourth year of his Reign and on the Second Day of the  Month, laid the Foundation Stone, according to  the plan given by David his father upon the ark  of alliance; every energy was used to render it a perfect  specimen of art; every stone, every piece of timber was  carved marked & numbered in the Quarry & ^in the^ forest  & nothing remained for the workmen at Jerusalem  but to join the materials with precission, on a refference  to the marks & numbers given by the workmen 
 and this was effected without the use of ax, hammers,  or mettal tool, so that nothing was heard at Zions save  harmony & peace; theres appears to have been a curious  idea of pollution in the use of any iron tools leveled  about the Tabernacle, or holy structure (by the Masons)  as it seemed this command was given to Moses  by the Almighty on Mount Sinai [##Exodus 20##], respecting  the construction of the Tabernacle, that no tools  of Iron to be used, giving in the stronged terms as  conveying pollutions, but gold, silvers & wood; brass  work at a distance, for the sound was not to be heard at  the Tabernacle. The Temple of Solomon was ownly  a small building, & very inferior in point of size  to some of our Churches, its dimensions being  ownly 150 feet long and 135 feet broad, but its splendor  & superiority lay in the richness of its materials, it  was built of white marble so excellently put together  that even the joints could not be distinguished, & looked  as one entire stone, the timber was of ceder & olive wood  covered with plates of gold & even studded with precious  jewels; the expense of the building & ornaments of this  Temple, it is said by Villopandus, amounted to £904,322,500, sterling 
 The value of the gold vessels alone was £545,296,206, sterling  and the silver was £439,344,000; added to this the wages,  provission, and other necessaries for 100,000 workmen  and 70,000 slaves for upwards of seven years! Besides  300 grand officers on masters and 3,300 overseers in whom  in addition to their wages, King Solomon presented as a  free gift £6,763,977, Henoditus informs us the yearly  treasures imported from Ophir was £3,240,000 sterling  all of our money; his annual tribute from dependant  nations, was £4,796,200 sterling. Solomon had  ships & sailed them to Ophir and Tarshish for gold, Silver  & precious stones, which was the most valuable part  of his revenue; he visited those places in person & with  his usual wisdom superintended not ownly the  collages of naval architecture established there but also   the tithing out of his own ships for the improvement  of this important branch of traffic, which [mattered this]  to beautify the Temple with such splendour, to the  service of God A talent of Gold is £5,476 sterling  5/27375

Noah sent  out a raven that never returned afterwards, then he sent out  the dove that he might ascertain whether the waters had subsided  this Bird very soon returned to the Ark, unable from the  prevalence of the waters to find a place of rest, at the end of  seven days he sent forth a dove a second time, which returned to  the Ark with an olive leaf in her mouth, as a token of peace &  reconciliation with God, ##Genesis 8## & the olive branch has been adopted

In the interior of the bottom  story, was a cavern in which the conte[mplat]ive mysteries were  celebrated. 5 -(Observance)- as Moses was appointed by the Alm-  ighty in this great undertaking in redeeming the Children  of Israel from Egypt why did he not perform his signs  himself instead of having his brother Aaron to act for him.  Ans. For Moses lisped & being slow of speech. Ques. How come   Moses to be thus defected in speech. Ans. By Pharaoh placing  a red hot cinder on his tongue, when a child, as a punishment  for a crime that he had committed before Pharaoh and all  his court in Eqypt. Quest. What might the crime be that  Moses committed? being a child)- Ans. As pharaoh having no  Heir to the Crown & Moses being brought up as his grandson by  his daughters, Pharaoh one day before his Nobles placed the Crown  on Moses head; no sooner was it on than Moses immediately  threw it off, & stomped upon it for which Pharaoh & his Court  were young to have him put to death, had it not been for  Pharaoh's daughter who begged him off. so that was the punishment 
 Inflected by on Moses which caused him to lisp—  Ques. How came Moses to quit his office under pharaoh & leave Egypt?    5. Moses slaying an Egyptian.##Exodus 2:11-14##—One day as Moses was out he saw an  Egyptian strugling with one of his brether, and ill using him vary  [much], which kindled Moses wrath against the Egyptians that he drew  his sword & killed him, & hid him in the sands; a similar circumstance  happened the following day, and Moses interfering in behalf of his brother  the Egyptian said—art thou going to slay me as you did the  Egyptian yesterday? By this Moses fearing it was made known  to Pharaoh, he instantly made off & took shelter under the  protection of the priest of Midian & remained with him for the  space of forty years in the character of a shepherd, & during that  time he had married the priest of Midian's daughter &c.—##Exodus 2:21##    Question How came Moses first to obtain this wonderful  miraculous rod, and where?—Ans. In the land of Midian.  Ques. By what manner    5.  Jethro and Moses in the garden conversing—As Moses was walking  one day in Jethro's garden & conversing with the priest of Midian  about the misery of the Children of Israel in Egypt he [sermasted]  a peculiar staff which was set up in the midst of the garden  without any visible design & after Moses inquired its use  attempted to take it up. in which he did to the [stagnation]  & surprise of Jethro the priest. hether to no person had been  able to remove it from the place where it had been so intently  planth; it was there & then that Moses first became in possession  of this rod & to be used by him, in displaying his miracles  before pharaoh & his court in Egypt &c.

[##Numbers 21:7-9##]    5. A Man represented on a hill, as [spying] with a  glass at shipping; it was to represent Solomon's vessels  returning from Tarshish & Ophir with gold, silver, &  precious stones for the Temple, making for the post  of Joppa; & from thence they wer conveyed by land carriage  to Jerrusalem for the service of the Temple, that was to  be built by King Solomon. [##Kings 10:10-27##]    5. Abraham visited by the  Angels as he sate by at his tent door; Sarah his wife, on  a smile, has been (unpercieved) listening to their conversation  bringing him the tidings of a son by his wife, which was  to be named Isaac; also of the destruction of the City  of Sodon & Gamorrah: ##Genesis 18## about this time.

Here is a land represented  as stretched down from a cloud, as if grasping a man of the  earth—this is the translation of Enoch after living in the  fear of God on Earth three hundred & sixty & five years   the god took him without seeing death, or even entering  the grave. ##Genesis 5:22-24##    5.

I: in the centre, signifies Holy Temple, on this Temple  shall be Holyi. This triangle was cast in gold; it was  discovered on Mount Moriah, by the workman undermining  the rock, 10 lay the foundation for the Temple of Solomon;  it was discovered six feet from the surfice of the rock, & by this  Equilateral triangle it led to the grand Subteranean Temple 
 built by the three Grand Masters before the flood; where was  discovered many things, represented on this Masonic plate,  with the three Grand Master's names, which can be found  in scripture; ##Exodus 32## (by those who know it) it was discovered in the  year of the world 2939, and 480, years after the children of Israel  came out of Egypt, &c A further illusion to the rod  —the transformation of Moses's rod into a serpent had  reference to events of the [opeabrt] importance to man, as our  first parents were beguiled by the devil, in the form of a serpent  so that miraculous rod, which had its origins in the Garden  of Eden & is supposed by the Jewish Rabbis, to have been one  of the ten things created. on the evening of the first  Sabbath & was changed into a serpent as a sign, to  confirm the promise of Delivering a select [portion] of  their restraints from Egyptian Bondage. This rod also  refered to the mighty work about to be accomplished in  Egypt; for as the rod of Mosess government was fearful  as the attack of a serpent to the Egyptians, so it was a  scepter of righteousness to the children of Israel. It was  called the rod of God, & used by Aaron in Egypt & Moses  in the wilderness. It was a sign of the Divine Author-  ity, & a visible demonstration of Gods power;  used to confound the pretended skill of the Magicians  theis show the Omnipitence of the Deity, & to humble the  pride of Pharaoh when he beheld the mighty wonders wrought  by so apparently contemptible [on agent] as a Shephard's Staff, 
 but above all, this rod metamorphized, was a type of  Christ's death, to which indeed all Masonry, ultimately points;  as by a serpent, Death came into the world—so by the  death of the Son of God, the serpent or Satan, was fully  vanquished & trodden under foot.    5. Moses lifting up  the serpent.—Thus Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilder-  ness, that as many as looked on it, might be healed of  the wounds, inflicted by firery serpents, for their disobedient  murmurings, ##Numbers 21:5-9## & the death of Christ h upon the cross thus  typiphied, was to deliver us from sin & Death, & to give a  full satisfaction & attonement for the sins of all mankind;  Moses took posselnig of  possession of this rod in the land  of Midian, & after Jetho had explained all the [posturetay] [posterity]  relatives to its movemention from the time of Adam,   & it was directed by the Almighty to be used as the  apparent agent of all his miracles. it was changed into  a serpent three different times, first at Horeb ##Exodus 4:2-5## again  in the land of Goshan before the congregation of the Elders,  & lastly in the Court of Pharaoh. ##Exodus 7:8-13## To give Moses a  further assurance of his power & protection, God commanded  him to put his hand into his bosom, which by   that simple act, contracted a supernatural leprosy;  he repeated the second time, but soon became sound  & healthy as the other; ##Exodus 4:6-9## next a small quantity 
 of water was changed into Blood at the word of God; ##Exodus 7:17-25##  the the asstonishment of Moses was somewhat alleged,  & his faith confirmed, by the assumer that he should  perform the same, & operates miracels in the land of  Egypt to induce pharaoh to set his captive Brether  at liberty; as a concluding confirmation of his  mission, Moses required to move in whose [many]  he was to demand the do liberation of the Israelites,  and the Almighty [consderached] to reveal to him that  awful name which made the pillars of the East tremble,  this tremendious word is—or—or—a construction  of —a tremendious context ensued between Moses as  the agent of the true God, & the Magicans as the agents of  the Egyptian Gods, Moses arrived with that powerful rod  what Adam was permitted to take from the tree of  knowledge, & which was the acknowledged testimony  of his [Diven cominussion] [Diveine Commission], wrote in the presence of   pharaoh & his court at [Taris]; an extraordinary [minute]  as a proof that his appeal to the gGod of Israel was not to be slited slited ^slighted^ with impurity; this rod was  [eust] by Aaron upon the ground & it immediately became  a serpent, twingi twining itself in folds to the combination  of the whole cCourt, Amenophis called for Jannes & Jambres ##2 Timothy 3:##  his magicians, role under took to perform the same miracle  but the serpent of Moses displayed his superiority, by devouring the serpents of the Magicians &c. 
 And fourteen hundred sixty four millions & four hundred &  eighty thousand Roman Crowns of Likes which at five shillings  the silver crown & six shillings the gold crown, amount to  nine hundred & eleven millions, four hundred & sixteen  thousand two hundred & seven p9ounds four shillings sterling.  To this we add Solomons annual revenue, which  was one million of crowns his tracking to Ophir for  gold, & the presents made him by all the castle as  mentioned, so that he exceeded all the kings of the world  for riches; we are not to wonder at his being able to carry  on this expensive Temple & that it surpassed all the structures of  the world for magnificence & contrivance since it was  built by the direction of Heaven. The glorious Temple  was for the sins of the world people Destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar  at the reign of Zedekiah in the year of the world 3515 and 588  years before Christ. ##2 Kings 25:8-9## The second Temple was rebuilt at at the  and of 70 years when the Jews returned from the Babylonians  captivity; but the workman were oblieged to keep swords by them  to repeal the samaritans, who watched all opportunities of   obstructing them in the work. ##Ezra 4:1-7## The second Temple fell for short  of the glory & magnificence of the former built by King Solomon  both as the structure & ornaments; neither had it the rot of  manna, the rod of Aaron, the Ark of the Covenant with  two tables of the same, nor the fire of sacrafice, which were  ordered to be kept perpetually in the Holy of Holies or Sanction  Sanctorires, as a memorail forever. Fourth I must  add is recorded in ##1 Chronicles 22:6-16|Scriptires## that when King David  was giving his advise to his son Solomon; he exhorts him  to build a house for the Lord, & to show how much he 
 said it at least: tells him that he had out of his [property]  laid up for purpose, one hundred thousand talents of  silver gold & a thousand thousand talents of silver vessels  brass & iron without wait, & he tills him that over & above  what he had mentioned before he had provided three thousand  talents of fine gold, & seven thousand talents of silver to overlay  the walls of the house, besides all this his princes & agent  men made a free gift of five thousand talents of gold, &  ten thousand talents of silver towards the building. Now all  these sums added to gether make up  108.00 talents of gold at £5075-15-7 is £548,244,150  1,017,000 talents of silver at £353=11=10 is £ 359,602,725  Total expens of the Building — * £ 907=846,875   In this glorious undertaking nothing was [smithed] [which] art  & [genious] aided by wealth & industry could supply; the twisted  & highly earned work of the Parian marble columns the plantings  of embossed gold; blazing strung with diamonds & other precious  stones; the gorgeous & magnifficent sculptures, all contributed  in rich union to display the wisdom of Solomon in  his appropriation of this grand Masonic pile, to the [sread]  purpose of Gods worship; the strength of King Hiram, for  his abundant supplies of materials & men & the [lennth]  of the ingenious—, who with a capacity more than Mortal  man exercised his shinning abilities to their utmost stretch  in Devising & executing such a perfect model of art. Before  the consecration of the Temple it was visited by Hiram  King of Tyre who was a complete master of the science ##1 King 7:13## 
 of operative masonry, & after fully viewing all its parts, he pronounced  it to be the highest effort of human genius, in which he  renounced his claim to pre-eminence on this noble science  of Grand Master of all masons. [##1 Kings 7:13-37##] The fame of his grand edifice  soon prompted the inquisitive of all Nations to travel &  spend some time at Jerusalem, & survey its exccellencies,  as far as was allowed to the gentiles, & they soon found that  the joint skills of all the world came infinitely short of  the Israelites in the wisdom, strength & beauty of their   architecture. when the wise King Solomon was Grand Masters  of all Masons at Jerusalem, when the learned King Hiram  was Grand Master at Tyre & the inspired—had been  master of the work; when true masonry was under the  care & direction of heaven & when the noble & wise  thought it an known to be associates of the ingenious  craftsman in them well fenced lodges; according to the  Temple of—became the just wonder of all  travelers on Earth. The pillars differ even in scripture  in regard to the size; they were nobly adorned with [chapiters]  &c, &c, and surmounted by two spherical Balls which  represented the two globes of the Earth & Heavens & pointed  out Masonry universal. [##1 Kings 7:40-41##] They were thus placed  by the expert by the direction of King Solomon in refference  to the remarkable pillar of a cloud & of fire which  proved a light & guide to the Israelites in their miraculous 
 escape from Egyptian Bondage, & covered with darkness  to the Egyptians, proved their destruction in the red sea.  King Solomon fearing the obduracy of his subjects might  of some future time cause them to forget the circumstances   attending that remarkable deliverance; placed the pillars thus  surmounted to this elevation situation, as a public  monument to remind the Jews when they entered or left  the Temple of the mercy of God to their nations; [##1 Kings 7:40-51##] in that great  event, these two pillars were of such vital importance to the  supporter of the Temple, that its destructions by Nebuchadnezzer,  the Lord, standing upon the alter, commanded the destroy-  ing Angel to strike the chapiters, or teach of the pillar  that ruin might ensue, not even of the pillar & porch  or the Temple itself on even all Jerusalem, but also of  the whole Jewish nations or polity; hence as the creation  of these pillars is seconded in scripture, as an eminent  proof of the magnitude & splendtion splendour of all  solomons empire, as well as the wisdom strength & learnth  of the three united Grand, Masters, so was their destruction  typical of the ruin of the Jewish state which recieved a  temporary annihilation of seventy years, when this   Temple was destroyed, as predicted by Jeremiah & other prophets,  for their sins in neglecting to keep holy the sabbatical years  according to the commandments of the Lord. [##2 Kings 25:8-17##] The priest in  the Temple perform every holy office of their religioun with  their feet uncovered. It is not any where commanded  that the priests should officiate Barefoot but among the  garments assigned for the priests shoes not being named 
 Sacramento Mar 13th 1853    Bro Woodruff    After a long silence I   wish to write you a few lines as   I am sure you are always anxious   to know what is going on in the world   to describe matters in california I shall   not attempt to do in full but shall   ask why is it I am a witness always   among the ungodly not however by way   of complaining for that is not my   feeling but on the contrary I Rejoice   that I am permited to sail amidst  all kinds of Strange scenes and why   it throws back the curtain that hangs   over Babilon and enables me to know   the ways of Men and the dealings of God   among the people and I feel like a   Watchman on the Picket Post and if   I should give way to my feelings I  should almost shout good and gloriously   but there is one thing left to keep me humble   and that is hard work but prehaps I   shall soon work out the debt and have   a chance to rest but if not I must try   to bear my fate in patience and not complain   truly the scenes I am called to witness are 
 unaccountable Yet nesessary I am   now endeavouring to locate my family as   none of her numerous friends here have as yet   done but as far as the scum of this wise   and Gene Gor Generation is concerned they   are willing Provided however, my family will   deny any frendship for me & it will be as the   Devil saw to ^the^ Saviour the Kingdoms of   the world and the glory of them all are   Yours but I am well persuaded that all   the Riches of this world that I am blest   with will come from a more reliable source   and by untiring dilligence continualy to   me the things arround me are quite inter-  esting but would not be did I not some   times get a peep through the Mist of Dark-  ness so as to comprehend the whys and  wherfores this is not my home only as it   must be yet I feel well I think I have   written to you once since I arrived if not   I will say the Elders all arrived safe and   Received their outfits through the liberately   of bro Horner and others but as for me   I do not Recon myself popular among the   Calefornia saints and Bro Sparks told   me they wanted some smart man   sent on like Jedediah Grant and   there would be buisness for him all the   time 
 But as the night is fast   coming on I must close this harried   Sheet wishing to Be Rememberd   to Bro Benson & Geo A Smith   to whom I intend to write as soon   as I can with this mail I send you   Several papers one is the Herald    Yours in the bonds of the new   Covenant forever Alexander Badlam    P.

 Sacramento July 27 1853    Dear Bro Woodruff  Feeling as I do that my labour is not   lost while I take all pains to write   you all the news of the day because   of the confidence I have in your punc-  tuality and kind attention in the full   and generous ^fulfilment^ of all your promices and   if in this respect my duties are as   faithfuly performed it is all I expect   to do. I am happy to tell you I feel   that my mission in california has   quite as nearly commenced it is well   for us that the God of Heaven governes   all things to bring about his own pur-  poses and uses his own instruments   to bring about his own work among   men on the earth And I rejoice in   it and pray that he may use me   as seemeth good in his sight   And I shall therfore direct all my   energies to the upbuilding of the   Kingdom of the Most High I have   as yet kept free from the entanglements   of Babilon I am confident our grand   enemy the Devil who has always en-  deavoured to check the movments   of the servants of god has not been   idle while I have been strugling to   lay the foundation of a good work,  it is not the gold of California   I seek as the danties (so called) but   a home with my brethren on earth and a   full Salvation with the sanctified of all  Nations and ages Past Present & to Come 
 and I ask no more In reply to your kind   and interesting letter I am glad you   are appointed on the temple for I know   your diligence and this reminds me of the   dream you related about the hurry of   labour the making of garments & by the   Saints who were preparing for the coming of   the Son of Man Yet I must say it  seems strange to me that so much   toil & care falls to the lot of a few and can   only conclude the kingdom will be thiers   of course it will belong to those who build   it. (all Right) Many will find when it too late   our Honoured and Heaven endued Apostles & Prop-  hets worn out will be known on earth to   only as imortal for thier names must   live forever May the blessings of Heav-  en ever be with them and it is my prayer   that all the Saints May be blessed with   a glorious harvest that the temple  may go on the prospect to me looks good   how vast the difference in the numbers of   murders in the City of Salt Lake   and Sacramento and at San Franci  sco when the dignity of man is insulted   he resorts to arms and he thinks so much   of his honour he is willing to sell his   rum soaked body to keep that he has   not got for if he had true honour he   would preserve his own body and spare   the life of another Yet duel fighters are   the things (not Men) whom the PEOPLE CHOOSE   to govern the affairs of State thus Endorsing all   thies wicked acts 
 Yet after all we have reason to be glad for a   california it is an exelent plaster and the   only one I know off strong enough to   draw off the scum from the big   Salt Lake Basin a portion of gold  dust is more powerful than Spanish   Flies and for the information of those   who are nearly GORNE of california fever I would   recomend a BATH in some of the pure streams   of Utah a little good advice from the Governour   and a good situation on the public works before   they pull up STAKES to go to a land of which they   know but little of but some may say if Bro Badlam   can go to california to get Rich why not me   I will say wait till you see him Rich and you will   get a portion of it as to his family he did not   go to california with the expectation of taking them   back to the valley but heHE will come when the   same calls that sent him away    I know not that I have a bitter enemy in   california but expect to enjoy the reputation   I live for Mormonism as it is ^is^ Honourable   and evry man who honours his calling as a Saint   will be respected when he is known it is ignorance   in a great degree that troubles many I stop my   pen to speak with one of our Ships Company of 1849  who tells me I have the good feelings of that   company because of the intrest I had for thier   welfare if so I am glad and hope to do good   to all men wherever i go that none may have   occations to complain I find it best to let   all things Roll as in thier time and places  Ever holding sacred the principles   of the gospel and the name of God as Ever I Remain your friend & Brother Alexr Badlam 
 after addings a few items I shall close for the present   as it ^is^ Possible that Sister Cobb dont know where   Isaac her Nephew is I will say he started ahead of the   Elders in January to Sydey in A^us^stralia I wanted him to   Remain with Me But he would not I have not heard from  him he wished me to Remember him to bro Benson which I   do through you.

 Sacramento City Aug. 28th, 52    Brother Wilford    I wrote you a few days since   in which I stated that those Bonds paid me by   Col. Reese were worth only 7c cts. in the dollar and he   gave me them at 8c cts. in the dollar. He wished me   to keep them as long as I could which I have done   as he supposed they would advance, and should they   bring even 8c cts. per dollar I was to pay him back the   amount and if they sold for any less than that he   would make it up. They are now worth only 65 cts.   and ^still at that^ I shall be obliged to sell them immediately as I   take the steamer for N. Yuk on the 1st Sept. the amount   he paid me in then was $1100 - the discount in that   amount between 8 c ch. and 65 would be 165$ which I   presume will be what I shall get for them    That amount $165 Mr. Reese must pay you so that   it can be forwarded this fall.  should that amount not   be right either way we will correct it.  The mail for   Salt Lake some days so that I cannot be more definite  on the subject.  I shall hold them as directed by   Col. Reese till the last moment which will be the   31st, inst I am sorry and feel quite disappointed that   that matter is not closed up and hope it will be   attended to immediately, that there will be no more   delay on the part of Mr. Reese at the valley.    Nothing new of interest with me.  please write me   by next mail to the [Suters] saying how emegration is   coming in.  The long letter of this mail to this place  I did not receive from you.

I think your friend M.

I had a very narrow escape this morning  from a serious accident for which I feel very  thankful to our Heavenly Father and the kind friends  for their prayers for me protection from him    Fearing the Indians might trouble as we were  examining our rifles, guns and pistols, one large  rifle band hose pistel requiring reloading I  undertook to discharge it at a mark, it burst  in many pieces in my hands, but injured me but  a trible, all expressed their great surprised at the  result. 
 wondering how it was possible for only me to  escape with so little injury as I did.    Please write me a long letter to Sacramento City  by next mail. Ms W. kindly promised to write  to Ms Carter by next mail, she will prize it  much coming from her and Mr. W.

 [upside-down text] Mail carrier has arrived—home not yet saw the Col. [end of upside-down text]    Johnsons Ranch, six miles from [Plua]  Aug 6th, 1852    My Dear Sister and Brother    Your favor of July 4th  was handed me by the mail carrier and very welcome it  was I can assure you, I should have been highly gratified  to have spent the 4th with you. Col. Reese was not at home  had gone to San Francisco. I am waiting here to see him on his  return, expecting him daily. California presents a dull and  dismal appearance, this is the dullest season of the year in  consequence of the scarcity of water, many men are out of em  ployment and cannot make one half enough to pay their board.    As soon as I see the Col, I shall go to Sacramento City and  see what is to be done there, should I not be able to find  some favorable business will take the steamer by and by for N. York  Our journey from Salt Lake was rather hard, however we  got along well, the last 400 miles are tough down the  Humbolt and over the mountains. How very, very much I  want to visit Salt Lake. I feel quite dissatisfied in  leaving so soon. I feel much more interest in it now than  formerly, it appears to me that I hardly saw you at all even  after going so long a distance for almost exclusively that  express business. Was it not for the great fatigue of the journey  across the plains I would return that way but I possess hardly  [usual] [cemaye] enough to undertake an other such trip.    I was glad to hear that Dr. B. had paid that dept. I  was not uneasy about it as it had Brother [Tamgs] name on it  that will be quite a help toward my settling my old affairs 
 [sideways text] I F Carter [end of sideways text]    and a settlement of them is something. God knows that I greatly  desire. I am like a broken stick, of no account can do nothing  no I desire. I feel it most deeply, and really hope that  something may turn up whereby I may extricate myself  I do not desire great wealth, that is not my object, society  friends and relatives I prize much higher, with a privilege of  living just as we shall wish we had when we came to die.  This has been my wish and determination for years past to do as near  what is right as possible, to do unto others just as I would have  another do unto me, but we will do w[r]ong sometimes particularly  when we are not under the influence of a higher power.    I feel very thankful that I spent the last night as I did in  Salt Lake, the influence is very great on me, many views of the  church coincide with my aim, that is, all with which I am fa  miliar, some I know nothing of, which I shall leave with time to  determine. We have had the advantages of a pious education,  a pious Mother whose prayers have been long and frequent   and fervent for our future happiness and hope we shall fully  appreciate them. I have been Providentially spared. I feel that I   have not deserved such loving kindness from the hands of a Supreme Being  but the mind is tempered to the slian lamb and I am I hope truly  thankful for his recollections of my wants and circumstances    On my way from this place to Sacramento I shall go by  Salmon falls and try to find Calvin, hope he has been successful  I should like much to meet with something by which I could  make a few thousand, this winter will be as favorable a time  as any I think to settle my old business should you be able to  collect something in those accounts and forward let us much as  possible be in American and foreign coin is the best I can do with  valley coin is 20 pr. ct. discount and many refuse it at that  there is a man in N. York formerly from Baltimore that is owing  me an important amount, was unfortunate in business, should  I chance to get that I should be all right, hope such  a thing may phappen presume you see my letter from the  plains by Brown. I shall expect a long letter from you by the  next mail judging from present appearances I may not  remain long in California, will write again soon, please remem  ber me to all our friends and believe me    Very truly your friend  I.

 Brother Azmon writes that god has set his hand to the work of gathering the  scattered remnant of Israel and that we are living down under the sounding of the  7 Angel and that the Kingsdoms of this world are alreddy given to Jesus Christ and  that he will soon break them with a rod of iron and dash them to peces  as a potters vessel that the vision of 2300 days (years) is ended and that the  sanctuary is now being clensed and the 3rd angel of ##Revelations 14:9-12|Rev 14: 9-12## is now delivering  his message of warning to the Laodiceans and all who are in reach of salvation  and warning them against worshiping the Beast and his image and  Receiving his mark he says he fully believes he says the sabbath of the fourth  com^m^and in the Seal of the Living god and the mark against which the 3rd  angel of ##Revelations 14|14 Rev## warns us of reseiving under the no less penalty than of  drinking the wine of the wrath of god is keeping the first day of the week [& on]  sabbath he says the Parable of the ten Virgins is fulfuled and the wise  Virgin have gone in to the marriage and the Door is shut  [##Matthew 25##] the Death  is Lovely street since you was here are 25 or near as can remember  I have buried my son Henry aged 18 years I have got to be great  grand father a bright little daughter I am 64 years old enjoy good health  I see the want of my right thumb but can tend saw mill verry well  Bill Cowles sends his respects to Aphek and says he is but 73 or 74 years  old he has his second wife he maried a woman that has had 5 husbands  he makes the 6th enjoys himself well sister Hellen is well and family  Cozen Abi Thompson has lost 2 sons 2 years past she has been maried  the second time but he is dead his name Luke Case Titus and femely is well  Cozen Thaddeas Thompson is well and family he has has lost his oldest daughter aged  about 18 years at is a general time of health among us you must be tired  of my scribling by this time and I must bid you A diue Remember me in  your prayers that the blessing of heaven may rest on you and your family  and all the Israel of god is the prayer of your weak Brother Ozem Woodruff

 Elder W. Woodruff, spoke of the   necessity of the Revelation of God being given   to this people for 40 years back to guide them   but the most difficult part for us to become   united in is not our temporal affairs—   40 years last November since the Saints was   drove out of Jackson County Mo: and that—   because they would not be controlled in their   Temporal affairs. And Presd B. Young Sr. has   commence at the very time the 40 years is up  to begin to enter into this United Order and he   turned the Keys at that time and it will   increase and increase untill like the waves of the   sea it will eventualy overwelm all before it   and there needs no long argument to convice us   that the time has come for our Heavenly Father   to call upon us to make a move in this direc  tion and have you any thing in this world that   is before the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ—  and we are required to unite together and offer   our all upon the Alter 
 Elder W. Woodruff then adressd the Meeting  on the Great Work of building Temples, and  fiting us to inherit the Kingdom of our Father  and in this the necessity of Complying with  the requirements of God through his Servants  and we must come to this or their is no  Salvation for us. 
 BLESSINGS ENJOYED BY THE SAINTS.    Remarks by Elder WILFORD WOORDRUFF, made in the Tabernacle, Grea[t]  Salt Lake City, May 12, 1861.    REPORTED BY J. V. LONG.    Brethren and sisters, after the  congregation receiving so much in-  structions, I feel that I shall make  my remarks very brief. It is truly   good to sit and hear the word of the  Lord, and it is truly a good thing to  believe in it; but it is still better to  practise it.    I have reflected to-day, as I fre-  quently do, with regard to the mercy  of God and his loving-kindness to the  children of men. The positions that  the children of men occupy with  regard to the difference there is in  the minds of men on the subject of  religion and the character of God is 
 an important one. I have considered  the responsibility that rests upon men  in regard to these things. There  seems to be very few that really have  faith in the Lord God of our fathers.  If we judge them by their works, we  must certainly come to this conclu-  sion. It is certainly a great blessing  to this people that they have faith in  God and in the promises of our   Heavenly Father.    Truth is one of the attributes of  the Almighty, and what he promises  he will fulfil. Now, if the children  of men believed this, they could save  themselves a great deal of trouble.  If those who embrace the Gospel  could have confidence to abide in the  truth, they would escape many trying  scenes through which the wicked will  have to pass. The trouble that awaits  this nation, and that other nations  have had to pass through in various  ages that are past, has been because  they have had no confidence in the   Lord. They have not obeyed him,  but have turned from him—rejected  the counsel given to them. It will  be precisely so with this nation when  their afflictions begin to come upon  them, for the Lord will be avenged.  We can now see the words of the  Lord and his Prophets fulfilling  before our eyes.    This is a peculiar generation—a  singular time in which we live.  There seems to be a great deal of the  word of the Lord fulfilling in our day  and age of the world. We profess  to acknowledge the hand of the Lord  in what we see around us, and I trust  we do it in our hearts. We have  read, many years ago, the promise  contained in the Book of Doctrine  and Covenants concerning the nation  in which we live. The Lord said, in  the early rise of this Church, in  speaking of this land, that we should  hear of wars abroad; but at the same  time we should not know the hearts  of the children of men in our own  country. And the commandment  was to his people to prepare them-  selves to stand in holy places when  the indignation of the Almighty  should be passing over the earth.  We now see these things coming to  pass. They are plain and clear before  our eyes. We have a part fulfilled;  and as truth is one of the attributes  of the Almighty, everything that he  says he will fulfil. The promise is to  the whole world—"He that believeth  and is baptized shall be saved, and he  that believeth not shall be damned."  This promise is sure; and if the Lord  fulfils in one instance, he will in  another. He will save the people if  they will obey him; and if they do   not he will not save them, but they   will have to reap the reward that is  due them for their works.    I consider that it is a blessing that   I have the opportunity of believing  in the Gospel and in the word of the  Lord. I believe in them, and rejoice  to know that they are true, and that  they will be fulfilled. I bear my  testimony to the truth of this Gospel.  I also testify that Joseph Smith was  a Prophet of the Lord. I know this   as well as I do that I exist. I know  by inspiration and by the revelations  of Jesus Christ and the manifesta-  tions of the Spirit of God from year  to year and from time to time. I  likewise see around me the fulfilment  of prophecy, and this tends to  strengthen me, and also every Latter-  day Saint. The Scriptures tell us  that there is a spirit in man, and that  the inspiration of the Almighty  giveth it understanding. It is upon  this principle that we become ac-  quainted with the truth, and the  power of the Gospel which we have  received. The principles of eternal  life are manifested unto us by the in-  spiration of the Holy Ghost; for that  Spirit rests upon us—it influences our  minds; and if we watch those teachings,  having within us the right feeling, 
 we shall comprehend things clearly  as they are. We can see the Lord  speaking to the nations and vexing   them in his hot displeasure, and still  many eat, drink, and are satisfied,  and do not appear to be as energetic  and active as they might be. It is  our duty to be alive and wide-awake  to the times, for the things that are  transpiring are joyful, because in them  we see the accomplishment and fulfil-  ment of the predictions of the Pro-  phets of God that have lived in this  generation. The things we are ex-  periencing now are attended with  salvation, and are preparing us to  magnify our callings and fulfilling  the object of our creation upon the  earth.    I always rejoice in seeing my  fellow-men come to a knowledge of  the truth by obedience to the Gospel  as taught by the servants of the Lord.  When men have gone forth in the  waters of baptism, and received the   laying on of hands for the gift of the  Holy Ghost, they receive the same  truth, the same light as we have re-  ceived; and thus we become of one  heart and one mind, and follow out  the inspiration of the Holy Ghost  which attend his Gospel. In preach-  ing the Gospel and administering the  ordinances of the Lord's house, the  Spirit of inspiration of heaven ac-  companies those who officiate, that it  will remain ever with them, if faith-  ful, in all the duties of life.    When I hear the brethren speak of  the dealings of God with the present  generation, I perceive that their minds  all run together. The record which  they bear is one; they all agree in  their testimony; they are one in  stating that the work of the Lord our  God will prevail over all its enemies.  But it is a calamity, as we look at it  naturally, for the generation in which  we live, that the Gospel is preached  and by them rejected; in consequence  of which the Spirit is taken from  them, because they follow the devices  of their own hearts and their wicked  imaginations. They follow the de-  vices of the Evil One, and they spread  it broadcast, as it were, the cross  which brings death and destruction,  which brings sorrow and mourning;  and this is the case with many in the   present day and age of the world.  There is not a man to-day that has  the Spirit of the Lord, and that is  faithful in his calling, but what can  see the state of things both in and  out of the Church. He can see them  with his eyes, and hear them with his  ears, and they can see the hand of  God thrown over his people to-day.    I rejoice in the blessings that the  Lord gives, and I feel that we ought  to be faithful. If there are anybody  who are blessed of the Lord, it is the  Latter-day Saints; and if there are  anybody upon the earth who are and  should be willing to obey counsel, it  is the Saints of the living God. We  have reaped the benefit of it for years,  and we know that it brings forth joy,  peace, and consolation to the souls of  men; and we would certainly be very  foolish to turn away from the only  source that will bring us joy, salva-  tion, and eternal life. To do this,  we should have to turn our backs  upon the only friends we have, and  shut up the only source from which  we draw the blessings we have in  this life.    The world really do not know  what they are doing; they don't   comprehend what lies before them;  they jndge after the hearing of the  ear, and while calamities will over-  take the wicked, as the Lord has  spoken, we have something to hold  on to and to rely upon. We have  seen the hand dealings of the  Almighty with us; we have learned  his promises. Has he broken his  promises to his people? He has not;  He has been faithful and true. I   firmly believe that we shall partake 
 of all the blessings of the kingdom  of God by obeying the counsel of  those set over us, for I know that  God has established a government  to control, to guide, and to dictate;  and we shall not find so perfect a  government as this in any part of the  earth, for it is the government of  heaven.    I desire that we may have power  and a disposition to live faithful to-  day, to do right, to obey counsel,  that whatever we are told to do we  may unite together and do with all  our hearts. If there is strength any-  where, it is here. If it does not exist  here, it does not exist anywhere.  There is no spirit of friendship in  the world; it has taken the wings of  the morning and flown away from  many of the nations, and the blessings  of the Lord are being withdrawn in  a great measure from the nations of   the earth. The people have no dis-  position to obey that which is right,  or give the servants of God an op-  portunity of preaching the truth for  the salvation of fallen man. Those  who despise those blessings and pri-  vileges will find that the consequences  and reward will follow.    I feel thankful that we are here in  the valleys of the mountains; and I  rejoice that we are at peace, and not  obliged to fortify Great Salt Lake  City, as the people are obliged to do  in Washington; nor is our President  compelled to flee to Canada to save  his life. We are safe and in quietude.  The enemies of this kingdom do not  understand the spirit and power of  the Gospel. It is a spirit and a  power that they cannot cope with,  and it is so with all the sectarian  world. We have the privilege of  lying down and of rising up in peace;  we have the privilege of bowing in  our families in peace, and getting up  and speaking our sentiments, and  none to make us afraid.    These are great blessings that we as  a people enjoy. I bear my testimony  that these things are true and faith-  ful. You know these things as well  as I do, and every man who lives his  religion knows it. The Lord is with  his people, and this kingdom will  spread abroad. And when the Lord  has destroyed the wicked, there will  be room for Zion to spread herself  abroad, and to rebuild the waste places  thereof. Then all things spoken of  in the Book of Doctrine and Cove-  nants will be fulfilled. It is good to  reflect upon these principles, for the  promises will be fulfilled, whether we  believe them or not.    I pray God to guide us, that we  may be prepared to partake of eternal  life and salvation, and share in all  the benefits of the Gospel of Christ,  and of the Holy Priesthood which  has been revealed to us in our day  and generation, which I ask in the   name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 
 JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.    REMARKS by Elder W. Woodruff, delivered in the New Tabernacle, Salt Lake  City, July 19,th, 1868.    -[REPORTED BY DAVID W. EVANS.]-    THE GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST—ESSENTIAL TO ABIDE ITS LAWS.    I am requested to occupy a little  time this afternoon in speaking to  the people. It is a great satisfaction to  me, and I presume it is to all Latter-  day Saints who enjoy their religion,  to contemplate and realize that God  is our friend, and that we have the  Gospel of Jesus Christ. Religion is  very popular in the world, and has  been for many generations; and the  religions of the world are as various  as the temporal governments of the  world. But for a person or commu-  nity to know and understand for  themselves the true gospel, the gos-  pel of Jesus Christ, must be a source  of great consolation.    I have taken a great deal of satis-  faction in the gospel of Christ; in  fat it has been my life. I have tra-  veled and preached this gospel for  the last thirty-five years, more or less,  either to the world or to the Saints  of God. And in my contemplations  and meditations, when I have had  sufficient of the spirit of God upon  me, I have realized the gifts and  graces and blessings pertaining to   the salvation of men in the gospel of  Christ.    The governments of the world are  varied.  We have despotic, monarch-  ical and republican governments, and  in order to become a citizen of any  one of them we have to obey the laws  of that government. A great deal  has been said about the form of go-  vernment, and the constitution under  which we live. They have been the  praise of all Americans, and perhaps  of people living in other portions of  the earth. We consider that we have  been blessed as a nation in possessing  the freedom and privileges guaran-  teed by the Constiution of the Uni-  ted States. They have been a rich  legacy from our fathers. We consi-  der our form of government superior  to any other on the earth. It gua-  rantees to us "life, liberty and the  pursuit of happiness." And while  the inhabitants of many other go-  vernments have been tyranically  bound up, and their minds controlled  in certain channels, and they have  been deprived of the right of liberty  of speech and of many other rights  valued by freemen, ours has guaran-  teed unto us all the liberty that can be  enjoyed by man. Still, I have many  times thought that we, as American  Citizens, have not prized the gifts  and blessings guaranteed to us by  the Constiution of our country. For  the last few years, especially, the  Constitution at times, has been look-  ed upon as a matter of the smallest  consequence. In some respects, how-  ever, it has been a blessing to us as  a people, and it is to the whole na-  tion, as far as it is carried out.  But  in order to fully receive its blessings  we have to honor its precepts.    Now it is just so with the gospel  of Jesus Christ. Those who believe  it and obey it in sincerity enjoy far  greater blessings than are enjoyed by  others. But we have to abide by the  laws of the gospel in order to enjoy  its blessings and privileges. 
 THE GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST, ETC.    From my childhood up, I have   prized the gospel. Before I heard it  proclaimed, I felt when perusing the  account of the blessings and privi-  leges enjoyed by the ancient Saints  and servants of God that I would  have been glad to have lived in those  days when the priesthood had the  keys of the kingdom of God, when  they had power to unlock the hea-  vens and to command the elements  and they would obey; when they had  power to heal the sick, cast out de-  vils, cause the lame to walk, and the  blind to see; when they could receive  communication from God, and com-  mune with holy angels. I could see  a power, glory and exaltation in those  principles for which I looked in vain  among men in my day; and I desired   to live to see a people by whom such  blessings would be again enjoyed. I  have lived to see that day. The first  time I ever heard this gospel preach-  ed, I felt that it was the first gospel  sermon I had ever heard; and I went  forth and was baptized and received  the testimony that it was true, and I  have rejoiced in this gospel from that  day to this, because I know it is true.  And I have wondered many times  that there are not more of the inha-  bitants of the earth who will open   their ears and hearts to hear and re-  ceive it that they may enjoy its bles-  sings both in time and eternity.    This Gospel makes us free. Was  there ever a more free people than  the Latter-day Saints are? No, there   never was in any age of the world.  There is not anything that will give  a man joy or consolation, or any  blessing temporal or spiritual, but  what is within our reach as far as  man in a mortal state has a right to  receive.    When we contemplate the gifts  and blessings the Gospel of Christ  has given to us, we of all men should  be the most cheerful, thankful and  faithful, and should honor our cal-  ling, and acknowledge the hand of  our God in the mercies which we  enjoy.    All men who have obeyed this  Gospel for the love of the truth, and  whose minds have been inspired by  the Spirit and power of God, have  felt to rejoice and take consolation in  it, and they have felt a great desire  to spread the knowledge of its prin-  ciples among their fellow men. When   first embraced by them it has seemed  to them as though they could con-  vince the world; and they have been  anxious to lay these principles before  their father's household, their uncles,  aunts, cousins, neighbors and friends,  believing that they would receive it.  I felt so myself. But I, with many   others, have found myself mistaken  in a great measure. I have traveled  hundreds and thousands of miles to  preach this Gospel. In my travels  I have warned many thousands of  my fellow men; but have been the  instrument, in the hand of God, in  gathering very few when compared  with the many I have preached to.  This has been the experience of all  the Elders. We have found, when  we came to lay these principles be-  fore the world, that they were not  ready to receive them. There would  be one of a family and two of a city  who would open their ears and hearts  and would receive the truth, and ga-  ther home to Zion. That is the way  the Kingdom of God has been built  up in this and every other age of the  world. There have been but a few  here and there that have been quali-  fied or prepared to receive and abide  the law of God. The minds of the   majority have been prone to evil as  the sparks to fly upward; and it has  been a hard matter to get the inha-  bitants of the earth to listen to our  message, and then make it a sub-  ject of prayer and receive and obey 
 DISCOURSE BY ELDER WILFORD WOODRUFF,    DELIVERED JUNE 27, 1875, IN THE SECOND WARD SCHOOL-HOUSE, SALT  LAKE CITY, AT THE FUNERAL SERVICES OF JOHN HOUSEMAN, AGED SIX  YEARS, AND WILLIE FRANKLIN, AGED FOUR YEARS, SONS OF WILLIAM AND  ANN WHEELER, BURNED TO DEATH AT WANSHIP, SUMMIT COUNTY, U. T.,  JUNE 24, 1875.    (Reported by David W. Evans.)    LITTLE CHILDREN ARE INNOCENT, AND ALL WILL BE SAVED—GOD, A  PERSONAGE OF TABERNACLE—THE LIFE OF THE SAVIOR, A LIFE OF  SUFFERING—SECOND COMING OF CHRIST.    I am entirely dependent this morn-  ing upon the Spirit of the Lord to  guide and direct me in what I may  say upon this painful occasion.  Those who have assembled here—  Brother and Sister Wheeler, and their 
 JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.    friends who mourn with them, are  dependent upon the same source for   comfort in their serious bereavement;  and in fact we are all dependent upon   the blessing and Spirit of the Lord in   all the labors of life, and I hope that,   in our services this morning, a large   measure of that Spirit will be impar-  ted unto us.    I feel disposed to read the ##Job 1|first   chapter## of Job as a preliminary to   any remarks I may make. -[The   speaker read the first chapter of the   Book of Job.]- We also see in read-  ing the history of Job that the devil   did not finish with him there, as it   seems the devil had another conversa-  tion with the Lord on this subject, in   which he informed the Lord that a   man would give anything for his life,   and that if he, the devil, touched   Job's flesh, he would certainly curse   God. And it seems from reading   this history that the Lord put   Job into the hands of the devil,  to do as he pleased with him,   only to spare his life. Of course  the history is familiar to you all   who have read the Bible, and you   are aware that the devil smoked Job,   and he was covered with boils from   the crown of his head to the soles of   his feet, so that he was in great dis-  tress, trouble and tribulation, yet in   the midst of it all he did not sin, but   acknowledged the hand of the Lord.    I may say, with regard to the case  which has brought us together this   morning, it is a little similar to that  of Job. We meet with some strange  things in the history of our lives in  the dispensations and dealings of God  with men. In the case before us we  are called to mourn the loss of two  children taken from Brother and  Sister Wheeler, we may say as sud-  denly and, in one sense of the word,  as miraculously, as were the sons and  daughters of Job. His affliction con-  sisted of not only in the loss of two  children, but of all his children and  also of all the possessions that he  had, yet still, under all this he said—  "Naked came I out of my mother's  womb, and naked shall I return   thither; the Lord gave, and the  Lord hath taken away; blessed be the  name of the Lord." [##Job 1:21##]    I know very well it is hard for any  person to be called to pass through  the scenes that we sometimes are  called to pass through in this life, it  is so in the case before us this morn-  ing. The loss of these little children,  taken away as they were, is certainly  painful, not only to the parents, but  to eyery person who reflects; and it  is a very hard matter for any of us  teo enter into and appreciate the depth  of sorrow which parents feel on occa-  sions like this, it is difficult to bring  the matter home to our own hearts  unless we have been called to pass  through similar affliction and sorrow.  At the same time there is no doubt  that we all sympathize with our  friends when called to pass through  trials and bereavement. And I will  here say to Brother and Sister  Wheeler, and to all my friends, there  are a great many worst things in this  world than the case we are now call-  ed to mourn.    Our children are taken away from  us in infancy and childhood, and they  are taken away as Job's were, in one  sense of the word, through the dis-  pensation of Providence, causing us  severe trials. This we will acknow-  ledge; but, as I have already said,  there are many things in this world  that are far more painful and afflict-  ing than to have our children burned  to death. My friends may ask—  "What is Brother Woodruff driving  at in this remark?" I will tell you.  I have lived in these valleys, twenty-  seven years, since the pioneers came  here. I have seen a whole genera-  tion of men and women grow up in 
 JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.    it, and abide in its laws and ordi-  nances in faithfulness and truth unto  death.    When Father Smith gave me my  patriarchial blessing he told me I  should bring my father's house into  the Church and Kingdom of God. I  had never seen any member of my  father's house from the time I obeyed  the gospel until I received my patri-  archial blessing, and I rested a good  deal on this blessing. Now, all men  who were acquainted with Father Jo-  seph Smith know that when he laid  his hands upon a man's head it seem-  ed as if the heavens and the hearts  of men were open to him, and he  could see their past, present and fu-  ture. And that is the way all men  in the holy priesthood should feel;  and whether patriarchs, prophets,  apostles or elders they should live so  as to enjoy the spirit and power of  their office and calling. This is our  privilege, but we do not always live  so; but this was the way with Father  Smith. After I had been with Zi-  on's Camp up to Missouri I returned  east, and on my way I visited my  father's household in Connecticut and   preached the gospel to them, and  baptized my father and all who were  in his house. In this I was blessed.  I also baptized some of my uncles,  aunts and cousins; but I left a nu-  merous host that did not receive my  message; they were not ready to re-  ceive my testimony; a few of them  did, and some of them have gathered  to Zion. I have rejoiced in this  and also in preaching the gospel to  the world, because I have known that  the gospel and the message which I  had were from God. I knew then  that they were true, and I know it  to-day; and I know they will have   their effect on the nations of the earth.    The gospel which we preach is the  power of God unto salvation to every  one who believes, both high and low,  rich and poor, Jew and Gentile.  There is no man who will receive  salvation without it; no man can re-  ceive exaltation and be crowned with  the fullness of salvation in the pre-  sence of God without receiving the  fullness of the everlasting gospel of  the Son of God.    All men who have received a glo-  rious salvation and resurrection and  have gone to receive their reward in  the presence of God, have had to go  there by keeping the laws that He  gave them. They have had to obey  the gospel of Christ on the earth;  they have had to receive the law and  abide that law in the flesh that they  might receive a fullness in the resur-  rection. It will take just as much to  save the Latter-day Saints and the  inhabitants of the earth in this gene-  ration as it did to save Adam, Enoch,   Seth, Moses, Elijah, Elias or Jesus  and the apostles. There is no change  nor variableness with the gospel of  Christ; its ordinances are the same  to-day, yesterday and forever. As  the Apostle Paul said "If we or an  angel from heaven preach any other  gospel than that we have preached  let him be accursed." [##Galatians 1:8##]    This gospel has been revealed to  us. We have received the light of  it and rejoice in it. By it and its  Author we have been sustained from  the commencement until to-day. The  gospel of Christ has never disap-  pointed any man or woman that ever  dwelt in the flesh. The God of hea-  ven—the Author of this gospel—  has never disappointed any body  who ever proved faithful to its pre-  cepts. And if the inhabitants of  the earth expect salvation through  any other medium they will be dis-  appointed. Whater salvation they  may get, they will not be saved in  the celestial kingdom of God. If   they have another glory it will be 
 LITTLE CHILDREN ARE INNOCENT, ETC.    these valleys of the mountains, and  they have become parents. I have  seen some, and I will not say a great  many, but I have seen some young  men, I say nothing about maidens,  who have met with untimely deaths  and who have gone to the grave dis-  graced, and a dishonor to themselves  and to their parents. Circumstances  of this kind are far more painful to  any parent in the world than it is for  their children to meet with sudden  death by accident or any other way.   I do not make these remarks to apply  to Brother and Sister Wheeler, for  none of us know what course our  children will take. We set good ex-  amples before them, and we strive to  teach them righteous principles, but  when they come to years of accounta-  bility they have their agency and  they act for themselves.    Many things are transpiring in the  earth to-day which we should regard  as great calamities and as grievous to  be borne if we had to pass through  them. Think of these late earth-  quakes in South America, eight thou-  sand people out of ten thousand in  one city sunk in the earth in a few  moments. And then, the tremen-  dous floods that are sweeping over  France and other parts of the earth,  causing the death of hundreds and  thousands of men, women and chil-  dren. All these things are in fulfill-  ment of the revelations of God, and  of the judgments which he has pro-  mised should come upon the earth in  the last days. One of the purposes  which the Lord has in view in gather-  ing his Saints to the valleys of the  mountains is that they may not share  in the sins or partake of the plagues  of Babylon; therefore we have rea-  son to rejoice before the Lord because  of his mercies and blessings unto us.  And with regard to a case like this  before us this morning—the loss of  these children—I want to say a few  words for the consolation of those  who are sorrowing. In the first place  these children are innocent before the  Lord; as to their death and the cause  thereof, that is in the hands of God,  and we should not complain of the  Lord or his dispensations any more  than Job did. These children have  been taken away very suddenly, and  in such a manner as to cause great  sorrow and distress to their parents,  but there is this consolation connected  with the matter—they are innocent,  they are not in transgression. They  have paid the law of death which  God passed on Adam, and all his pos-  terity; but when their spirits left  their bodies and got into the spirit  world their trouble and affliction were  over. Their death was a very pain-  ful one, but their suffering is now  over, and in a few years from now  they will come forth out of their  graves in the morning of the resur-  rection, not marred by fire or any ele-  ment, but clothed with glory, immor-  tality and eternal life, in eternal  beauty and bloom, and they will be  given into the hands of their parents,  and they will receive them in the  family organization of the celestial  world, and their parents will have  them for ever. They will live as  long as their God lives. This, to   Latter-day Saints, who believe in the  resurrection, should be a source of  comfort and consolation.    Why our children are taken from  us it is not for me to say, for God  never revealed it unto me. We are  all burying them. I have buried one-  third of the children that have been  given onto me. I have had some  thirty children born to me, and ten  of them are buried, all of them  young. The question may arise with  me and with you—"Why has the  Lord taken away my children?" But  that is not for me to tell, because I  do not know; it is in the hands of the 
 THE GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST, ETC.    the glory of the law they keep in the  flesh. If a man cannot abide a celes-  tial law, he cannot receive a celestial  glory, if a man cannot abide a terres-  trial law he cannot receive a terres-  trial glory; and if he cannot abide a  telestial law he cannot receive a te-  lestial glory, but will have to dwell  in a kingdom which is not a king-  dom of glory. This is according to  the revelations of God to us.    Here is where we differ from the  world of Christendom. Because we  have received the Gospel in its full-  ness and plainness, with its ordinan-  ces, its organization, with the priest-  hood with its keys, powers and bles-  sings, its revelations and its light,  truth and inspiration and its Holy  Ghost. Everything which belongs  to it in one age of the world belongs  to it in another. In this the Gentile  world lie in darkness; they have fol-  lowed the same example of unbelief  as ancient Israel, by rejecting the  Gospel and persecuting the Saints,  and putting them to death, and shed-  ding the blood of the prophets and  apostles and those who held the Gos-  pel of the Kingdom of God in their  day; and they have gone into the  wilderness of darkness and unbelief,  and remained so, until God restored  the Gospel in this day.    Well, we as a people should rejoice  in this Gospel, for in possessing it  we are blessed above our fellow men.  No matter what the feelings of the  world may be, they do not make the  truth of God without effect, not  a bit of it. God has set His hand  in these last days to restore Israel,  and to call upon the inhabitants of  the earth for the last time. Ancient-  ly the Jews were called first. Jesus  came to them—his brethren—first;  the Gospel of the Kingdom was es-  tablished, and the Church organized  among them first; they rejected Him  and put to death their Shiloh, their  King, who had come to deliver them.  He did not come as they expected;  they looked for a King, a monarch,  a leader, a warrior coming in the  clouds of heaven with power and  great glory to lead them to battle  and to set up an earthly kingdom  and rule and reign over them; they  did not look for him to come as the  Lamb slain from the foundation of  the world. They had not the light,  and consequently rejected Him and  His message and put Him to death,  and the Kingdom was given to the  Gentiles—first to the Jews, then to  the Gentiles. In these last days it  came to the Gentiles first; and when  they have proven themselves un-  worthy, it will be given to the Jews.  It is to the Gentiles that we have  been called to preach the Gospel.    For the last thirty-eight years,  since its establishment, have the El-  ders of this church been laboring  and traveling for the spread of the  principles of this Gospel. You may  track history from the days of the  ancient patriarchs to the days of Jo-  seph Smith, and you cannot find any  account of men who have traveled as  the Elders of Israel have. Jesus told  His disciples to go into all the world  and preach the Gospel to every living  creature, and he that believed and  was baptized should be saved, and  he that believed not should be damn-  ed. But we can trace almost every  mile of the travels of the ancient  Apostles, and with the exception of  Paul, their travels were confined to  Asia, and chiefly to Jerusalem and  Judea. But the Elders of this church  have traveled in every gentile nation  under heaven that would receive the  message. And as a general thing  the Elders have been faithful in this  work among the nations; and we  have not yet ceased to send them to  the gentiles, and we shall continue to  do so until they entirely reject the 
 JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.    Lord, and it has been so from the  creation of the world all the way  down. Children are taken away in  their infancy, and they go to the spirit  world. They come here and fulfill  the object of their coming, that is,  they tabernacle in the flesh. They  come to receive a probation and an  inheritance on the earth; they obtain  a body or tabernacle, and that taber-  nacle will be preserved for them, and  in the morning of the resurrection  the spirits and bodies will be reunited,  and as here we find children of vari-  ous ages in a family, from the infant  at the mother's breast to manhood, so  will it be in the family organization  in the celestial world. Our children  will be restored to us, as they are laid  down if we, their parents, keep the  faith and prove ourselves worthy to  obtain eternal life; and if we do not  so prove ourselves our children will  still be preserved, and will inherit  celestial glory. This is my view in  regard to all infants who die, whether  they are born to Jew or Gentile,  righteous or wicked. They come  from our eternal Father and their  eternal Mother unto whom they were  born in the eternal world, and they  will be restored to their eternal pa-  rentage; and all parents who have  received children here according to  the order of God and the holy priest-  hood, no matter in what age they  may have lived, will claim those chil-  dren in the morning of the resurrec-  tion, and they will be given unto them  and they will grace their family orga-  nizations in the celestial world.    With regard to the future state of  those who die in infancy I do not feel  authorized to say much. There has  been a great deal of theory, and many  views have been expressed on this  subject, but there are many things  connected with it which the Lord has  probably never revealed to any of the  Prophets or patriarchs who ever ap  peared on the earth. There are  some things which have not been  revealed to man, but are held in the  bosom of God our Father, and it may  be that the condition after death of  those who die in infancy is among  the things which God has never  revealed;  but it is sufficient for me  to know that our children are saved,  and that if we ourselves keep the faith  and do our duty before the Lord, if  we keep the celestial law, we shall be  preserved by that law, and our child-  ren will be given unto us there, as  they have been given here in this  world of sorrow, affliction, pain and  distress. It has no doubt been a  marvel many times, in the minds of  men and women, why God ever  placed men and women in such a  world as is, why he causes his  children to pass through sorrow and  affliction here in the body.  The  Lord has revealed something to us  concerning this matter, and we have  learned enough about it to know that  this thing is necessary. We know  that we are created in the image of  God, both male and female; and  whoever goes back into the presence  of God our eternal Father, will find  that he is a noble man, a noble God,  tabernacled in a form similar to ours,  for we are created after his own im-  age; they will also learned that he has  placed us here that we may pass  through a state of probation and ex-  perience, the same as he himself did  in his day of mortality. And time  and again it has been revealed in  the revelations of God given in our  day, as well as in the Bible and Book  of Mormon, that these things are  necessary in order to enable us to  comprehend good and evil, and to  be prepared for glory and blessings  when we receive them. As the  Apostle argues very strongly in the  Book of Mormon—"If we never  taste the bitter how will we know 
 JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.    Gospel of Christ. How long that  will be, it is not for me to say. The  Lord is going to make a short work  in these last days, He will cut short  His work in righteousness. By and  by the gospel will be taken from the  gentiles and will be sent to every  branch of Israel, and all will hear the  sound of the Gospel.    We are called to build up Zion,  and to establish righteousness and  truth; called to build up the kingdom  of God, and to warn the nations, that  they may be left without excuse in  the day of God's judgment and cala-  mity. Now, the eyes of the Latter-  day Saints, of those at least, who  live their religion, are open. They  understand the signs of the times.  They are not walking in darkness;  they should not be, at any rate. They  should have the light, and understand  the signs of the times, and know the  signs of the coming of the Son of  Man. The world does not under-  stand these things; they did not in  the days of Christ. They did not  understand that Jesus was the Son  of God, come to establish His king-  dom and to deliver Israel, and they  do not know it to-day; and that  makes the difference between them  and the Latter-day Saints. The  reason of this is that they have not  received the Gospel and the Holy   Ghost. They have not the inspira-  tion of the Almighty. They have  a spirit within them; but the in-  spiration of the Almighty would give  them understanding if they would  embrace the Gospel. But being  without the Gospel their understand-  ings are not enlightened. They do  not understand the scriptures, nor  the signs of the times. They do not  understand those principles which  God reveals to those who keep His  laws. This is the difference between  us and the world.  We have an anx-  iety for their salvation; so has our  Father in heaven; but they must  abide the law. The God of heaven  abides a law, all the hosts of heaven  abide laws; they are exalted and glo-  rified by law. All the creations of  God are governed by law. The  earth abides the law for which it was  created. I have many times said,  and I think so still, that all the crea-  tions of God, except man, abide the  law. The beasts of the field, the  fowls of the air and the fish of the  sea all abide the law by which they  were created. I do not know of any  thing that breaks the laws of God  but man, who was made after the  image of God. And we as well as  all the other creations of God must  abide the law of our creation in or-  der to receive a fullness of glory and  blessing. This is the position we oc-  cupy as Latter-day Saints. We have  the Gospel, we profess to abide the  law of the Gospel; and we should, as  a people, be awake to the fact that  our Father in heaven has done all  He could for the salvation of the hu-  man family. He has made known the  laws necessary for the exaltation and  glory of man, and has done all that  can be done by law. We read that  in Adam all died, and that in Christ  all were made alive. Jesus has died  to redeem all men; but in order that  they may be benefitted by His death,  and that His blood may cleanse them  from all actual sin committed in the  flesh, they must abide the law of the  Gospel. The sins done through Adam  we have been redeemed from by the   blood of Christ; and in order to ob-  tain salvation we must be obedient  and faithful to the precepts of the  Gospel. I feel as though we as a  people ought to rejoice; and we should  prize these gifts and blesssings God  has put into our hands, and we  should seek to magnify our callings,  and as a people fulfill the expectation  of our Father in heaven, and the ex- 
 LITTLE CHILDREN ARE INNOCENT, ETC.    how to comprehend the sweet? If  we never partake of pain how can  we prize ease? And if we never  pass through affliction, how can we  comprehend glory, exaltation and  eternal blessings?"    The Lord has said concerning  Jesus, that he descended below all  things that he might rise above all  things, and comprehend all things.  No man descended lower than the  Savior of the world. Born in a  stable, cradled in a manger, he tra-  veled from there to the cross through  suffering, mingled with blood, to a  throne of grace; and in all his life  there was nothing of an earthly  nature that seemed to be worth  possessing. His whole life was  passed in poverty, suffering, pain,  affliction, labor, prayer, mourning  and sorrow, until he gave up the  ghost on the cross. Still he was  God's firstborn son and the Re-  deemer of the world. The question  might be asked why the Lord  suffered his Son to come here and to  live and die as he did. When we  get into the spirit world, and the  veil is withdrawn, we shall then  perhaps understand the whys and  wherefores of all these things.  In the dispensations and providences  of God to man it seems that we are  born to suffer pain, affliction, sor-  rows and trials; this is what God  has decreed that the human family  shall pass through; and if we make  a right use of this probation, the  experience it brings will eventually  prove a great blessing to us, and  when we receive immortality and  eternal life, exaltation, kingdoms,  thrones, principalities and powers  with all the blessings of the fulness  of the Gospel of Christ, we shall  understand and comprehend why  we were called to pass through a  continual warfare during the few  years we spent in the flesh.    No.3.    It certainly does require a good  deal of the Spirit of the Lord to  give comfort and consolation to a  father and mother mourning for the  loss of their children; and without  the Gospel of Christ the separation  by death is one of the most gloomy  subjects it is possible to contemplate;  but just as soon as we obtain the  Gospel and learn, the principle of  the resurrection, the gloom, sorrow  and suffering occasion by death  are, in a great measure, taken away.  I have often thought that, to see a  dead body, and to see that body laid  in the grave, and covered with earth,  is one of the most gloomy things on  earth; without the Gospel it is like  taking a leap in the dark. But as  quick as we obtain the Gospel, as  soon as the spirit of man is enlight-  ened by the inspiration of the Al-  mighty, he can exclaim with one of  old—"Oh grave, where is thy vic-  tory, Oh death, where is thy sting?  The sting of death is sin, and the  gift of God is eternal life, through  our Lord Jesus Christ." ##1 Corinthians 15:55-56## The res-  urrection of the dead presents itself  before the enlightened mind of man.  and he has a foundation for his  spirit to rest upon. That is the  position of the Latter-day Saints to-  day. We do know for ourselves, we  are not in the dark with regard to  this matter; God has revealed it to  us, and we do understand the princi-  ple of the resurrection of the dead,  and that the Gospel brings life and  immortality to light. We have re-  ceived the Gospel, and if we are true  to the principles of that Gospel as  long as we live, we shall be made  partakers of immortality, exaltation  and glory.    I know very well that the loss of  their children in this terrible man-  ner is a sad affliction to brother and  sister Wheeler. It was a sad afflic-  tion for Job when his children and    Vol. XVIII. 
 THE GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST, ETC.    pectation of those who have gone be-  fore us.    The ancients are not perfect with-  out us, neither are we perfect without  them.  The old prophets and apos-  tles had their day to labor in warn-  ing the world. Noah preached to  the inhabitants of the world, and  showed his works by his faith,  though he did not save a great  many. Abraham, Isaac and Jacob,  Moses, Elias and the prophets, Jesus  and the Apostles all had their day.  Their work is finished.  They sleep  in peace.  This is our day, and we  should labor while the day lasts; by-  and-by  night will come when no man  can work.  We shall not have 365  years as Enoch had to prepare Zion  for translation. [##Genesis 5:23##]    As I before remarked the Lord is  going to make short His work, or no  flesh can be saved.  There are great  events at our doors, and the Saints  of God should be on their watch-  tower.  We should have our eyes,  ears and hearts open to see, hear, un-  derstand and receive the counsels and   reproof revealed through the mouth  of the servants of God in our day.    The Gospel of Christ is one of the  greatest blessings that can be be-  stowed upon man.  Eternal life, the  Lord says, is the greatest gift of  God.  We can obtain that, only  through obedience to this Gospel.  This, brethren and sisters, is our  blessing.  We possess it, and have  been gathered here by it.  Had it  not been for the Gospel we should  still have been in England, the Uni-  ted States and abroad among the na-  tions of the earth, and Utah would  have been a desert sage plain, inha-  bited only by crickets and Indians,  as it was when we came here.  The  Elders of Israel might have preached  until they were as old as Methuselah,  and we should never have gathered  had it not been for the inspiration of  the Almighty.  You and I, and all  who have received the testimony of  Jesus Christ know that these things  are true.  All the Saints of God  among the nations, who have been  faithful, have been inspired by the  same spirit to gather home to   Zion.  Why have we gathered to  Zion?  To fulfill the revelations of  God.  Isaiah and Jeremiah and nearly  all the prophets since the world be-  gan have foretold the gathering of  the people in the last days to estab-  lish Zion, from which the law of the  Lord should go forth to rule the na-  tions of the earth, while the word of   the Lord should go forth from Jeru-  salem.  We are here to do these  things, and to receive teachings and  instructions that we may be prepared  for the coming of the Son of Man.  We are here to be shut up a little   while in these chambers of the moun-  tains, while the indignation of the  Almighty passes over the nations.  For this the Lord through his an-  cient servant said, "Come out of her,  my people, that ye be not partakers  of her sins, and that ye receive not of  her plagues." [##Revelation 18:4##]    The question is often asked by sec-  tarian ministers, "Why could you  not live in New York, Liverpool, or  London, as well as going to Zion?  Because we should be in the midst of  sin and wickedness and abomination,  and it would be very difficult, while  so situated, to keep from being pol-  luted by the evils which reign upon  the face of the earth at the present  time.  And to overcome these evils  we have been gathered together,  that we may be taught in the prin-  ciples of truth, virtue and holiness,  and be prepared to dwell in the pre-  sence of God.    When we embraced the Gospel we  had only just begun our work.  Be-  ing baptized into this Church is only  like learning the alphabet of our 
 JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.    possessions were taken from him in  an hour, but yet he had sense or  knowledge enough to understand  and say that when he came into the  world he possessed neither children,  houses, lands, horses, oxen, camels  nor asses, but that all his wealth  had been given to him by the Lord,  and that the Lord had taken them  away and blessed be his holy name. [##Job 1##]  I will say to our morning friends,  your children are taken away and  you can not help it, we cannot any  of us help it; there is no censure  to be given to parents when they  do the best they can. A mother  should not be censured because she  can not save her sick child, and we  have to leave these things in the  hands of God. It will be but a  little time until they will be restored  to us; in a little time brother and  sister Wheeler will again have the  children whose loss they now   mourn.    With regard to the growth, glory,  or exaltation of children in the life  to come, God has not revealed any-  thing on that subject to me, either  about your children, mine or any-  body else's, any further than we  know they are saved. And I feel  that we have to put our trust in the  Lord in these afflictions, we have  to lean upon his arm and to look to  him for comfort and consolation.  We do not mourn under these  afflictions as those who have no  hope; we do not mourn the loss of  our children, as though we were never  going to see them again, because we  know better. The Lord has taught  us better, and so has the Gospel;  the revelations of Jesus Christ have  shown us that they will be restored  to us in the resurrection of the just.  And I will here say with regard to  the Gospel of Christ, that it is one  of the greatest mysteries under the  heavens to me why there are so few  of the human family, whether in the  Christian, Pagan or Jewish world,  who take any interest in eternal  things, in the state of man after  death. If we read the Bible we  learn that Noah, filled with revela-  tion, and with the Gospel in his  hand, although he labored a hundred  and twenty years, could not get a  solitary soul except his own family  to go with him for salvation. It  was similar to the days of the Patri-  archs and Prophets, and if we come  down to the days of Christ, we find  that his testimony was rejected by  the rabbis, high priests and the  great mass of the people, and he  chose for his Apostles twelve poor  fishermen, and they and very few  of the people, comparatively speak-  ing, were all that received the teach-  ings of Jesus and followed him  through the regeneration; while the  whole Jewish nation, with these  few exceptions, were ready to put  their Shiloh to death, and he was  the person upon whom the salvation  of the whole house of Israel de-  pended. It is just so to-day. The  great majority of the people reject  the words of life and salvation  which are proclaimed unto them.  God, in these last days revealed the  Gospel of Jesus Christ to Joseph  Smith by the teachings of angels  out of heaven, and its principles are  made known to the world, and there  has never been a congregation of  Gentiles, from that day to this, to  whom the Elders of Israel have  borne record of these things, but  what the Spirit of God has also  borne record of the truth of their  testimony; and herein lies the con-  demnation of this generation, for  "light has come into the world,  but men love darkness rather than  light, because their deeds are evil." ##Doctrine & Convenants 29:45##  I ask, in the name of God and huma-  nity, why is it that intelligent beings, 
 JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES    mother tongue—it is the very first  step.  But having received the first  principles of the Gospel of Christ, let  us go on to perfection.    Brethren and sisters, let us lay  these things to heart and try to rea-  lize that the eyes of God, of angels,  of those who have gone before us are  waiting and watching for the comple-  tion of our labors.  We have every-  thing to stimulate us to action to do  the will of God and overcome evil  and be humble, obedient, diligent and  faithful.  Let us labor faithfully while  we dwell in the flesh, that we may be  satisfied with our labors when we get  through.  We have everything to  encourage us here in the valleys of  the mountains.  We have the bles-  sings of God visible over us day by  day in our preservation, and in the  preservation of the crops and the  fruits of the soil.  The hand of the  Lord has been over the land.  Who  would have been believed twenty  years ago, if he had said that this bar-  ren, desolate waste would have be-  come like the garden of Eden?  It  never could have been done except  through the mercies and blessings of  God.  His promises have been ful-  filled to us, and we can just as well  acknowledge His hand in these tem-  poral blessings as in anything else,  for the hand of God is in it all.    I pray that God will bless us with  His spirit, and give us power to  maintain our integrity, magnify our  callings and to be faithful to our co-  venants, to our God and to each  other, that we may overcome the  world, the flesh and the devil and be  prepared to inherit eternal life, for  Jesus' sake:  Amen. 
 LITTLE CHILDREN ARE INNOCENT, ETC.    made in the image of God, take no  interest in their condition after  death? They know they are going  to die, and, if they have any sense or  reflection, they know they will live  after the death of their mortal bodies;  still men will sell their eternal inter-  est for money, for a few hundred or  a few thousand dollars they will sell  all the interest they have in the  eternal world; in fact, they take no  interest in their eternal welfare.  Their cry is—"Give me gold, silver  and honors the few years I spend  here, and eternal life may go where  it pleases, I have no interest in that."  I ask again, why is it that the human  family take no interest in these  things? We have preached over  forty years. I have been engaged in  that work over that time, and have  proclaimed the words of eternal life  to millions of people, and have tra-  veled more than a hundred thousand  miles in so doing, and, as the Pro-  phet has said, I have found one of a  family and two of a city who have  had eyes to see, ears to hear, and  hearts to understand, and they have  been gathered up from the various  nations of the earth into the moun-  tains of Israel, and here to-day we  have a little handful of people, out of  the twelve hundred millions who  dwell upon the earth, who feel an  interest in building out the Zion and  kingdom of God upon the earth, and  who are desirous to be saved in  that kingdom.    Now I would rather be poor all the   days of my life, I would rather go  through poverty and affliction, it  matters not how severe, even to the  sacrifice of my own life, then lose  salvation and eternal life, because  I have faith in it, and always had. I  always have had faith in the Bible  and in the revelations of God since I  was a boy like these sitting on these  seats, eight or ten years old, when I  went to the Presbyterian Sunday  school and read about Jesus Christ.  I believed then that he was the  Savior of the world; I believed that  the Old and New Testament was true.  I believe it to-day. What would it  profit a man to gain the whole world  and lose his own soul? What will  a man give in exchange for his soul? ##Mark 8:35-36##  When he comes into the presence of  God he can't buy it. This is the  position of the world. There is none  of us going to live but a little while;  we shall all pass away soon, and our  eternal destiny depends upon the  few days, weeks, months or years  that we spend here in the flesh. Do  you not think it will pay a man or a  woman to keep the commandments  of God? It will, and when we enjoy  the Holy Spirit, when we are trying  to live our religion here on the earth,  we are the happiest people on God's  footstool, no matter what our circum-  stances may be. I do not care  whether we are rich or poor, whether  in happiness or affliction, if a man  is living his religion and enjoys the  favor and Spirit of God, it makes  no difference to him what takes place  on the earth. There may be earth-  quakes, war, fire or sword in the land,  but he feels that it is all right with  him. That is the way I feel to-day.    With regard to the Gospel of  Christ, it is a thing that we should  all labor to maintain the few years  that we spend here. When I get  through with this life and go into the  spirit world, I do not want to miss  what I have in anticipation. I have  always desired to see the Savior,  Father Adam, Enoch, Abraham,  Isaac, Jacob, and those old Prophets  we read about in the Bible. I de-  sired this before I heard this Gospel,  I desire it to-day; and I do not wish  to miss this, for nothing in this world  would pay me for such a sacrifice.  But I know that it requires constant 
 JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.    warfare, labor and faithfulness before  the Lord in order for us to keep in  fellowship with the Holy Spirit, and  to live in such a manner that we may  obtain these blessings. Jesus says—  "Strait is the gate and narrow the  way that leads to eternal lives, and  few there are who find it, while broad  is the way that leads to death, and  many there be who go in thereat." ##Matthew 7: 13-14##  The road to death is broad enough to  catch the whole world, and they do  not like to walk in the strait and  narrow one, they do not like to keep  the celestial law. I have met with  professed ministers of the Gospel, in  my travels, at whose tables I have  eaten and drank, and I have given  them the Book of Mormon and the  Book of Doctrine and Covenants,  and have talked to, and labored with  them, and I have known some of  them spend days and days in this  warfare, trying to decide which to do,  whether to receive the Gospel of  Christ, and take the reproach of the  world, or reject it; and I may say  that in nine cases out of ten they  have come to the conclusion to reject  it. When I visited Fox Island the  first time, I went to the house of  Mr. Newton, a Baptist minister; and  I stayed with him. But first I went  to his church, and heard him preach,  and when he got through I wanted  to bear record of the Gospel, for I  had a message to that people, and I  appointed a meeting for 4 o'clock  in the afternoon, and I've preached the  Gospel to them, and Mr. Newton took  me to his home, and I gave him the  Book of Mormon and the Book of   Doctrine and Covenants, and for ten  days that man walked about his room  until midnight trying to decide what  he should do. The Spirit of the  Lord bore record to him that my  testimony was true, and he felt that  if he obeyed the Gospel which I had  proclaimed unto him he would lose  his good name and honor among men,  but that if he did not receive it, he  would be damned. Finally he re-  rejected it, and the consequence was  that he became a vagabond, and a  miserable outcast. I baptized all  his flock who owned any portion  of the meeting-house, and if he had  embraced the Gospel and been gath-  ered with them he would have been  here and saved in the kingdom of  God, instead of the vagabond that  he has since become. I merely men-  tion this to show how the minds of  some men are acted upon by the tid-  ings of the Gospel. Some of them  feel that it would be a great reproach  to obey the Gospel and to keep the  commandments of God. Bless your  souls, we who obey the Gospel of  Christ are all in good company.  Whenever you are persecuted for  righteousness sake, said Jesus, rejoice  and be exceeding glad for so perse-  cuted they the Prophets and Apostles  which were before you.    I will say to all, whether in the  church or in the world, it will pay  you to keep the commandments of  God. Here is a man who has a wife  that he thinks a great deal of; they  have lovely children, and the ties of  affection bind them closely. Now  should not such a man have respect  enough for God to keep his com-  mandments, and so secure to himself  his wife and his children in the celes-  tial world after the resurrection?  But you cannot get worldlings to  believe in such a principal; the  people, as I said before, have not in-  terest enough in the things of the  kingdom of God to be willing to keep  the commandments of God.    I say to the Latter-day Saints, we  should be faithful to our God. We  are blessed above all the people that  breathe the breath of life upon the  earth, and we are blessed above all  other dispensations and generations 
 LITTLE CHILDREN ARE INNOCENT, ETC.    of men, for the Lord has put into  our hands the power to build up his  Zion upon the earth, never more to  be thrown down, and this is what no  other generation has ever been called  to do. But although this is the mis-  sion of the Latter-day Saints, we  have a continual warfare to wage—a  warfare with the powers of darkness,  and a warfare with ourselves. The  ancients had a similar experience to  pass through—they had their day  of trials, troubles and tribulations.  Enoch labored three hundred and  sixty-five years in building of Zion,  and he had the opposition of the  whole world. But the Lord blessed  him so that he maintained his ground  for that length of time, and gathered  together a few out of the nations of  the earth, and they were sanctified  before the Lord, and he had to take  them away, and the saying went forth  —"Zion is fled." So you may trace  down all the Prophets. Read the  history of Ezekiel, Jeremiah, Isaiah  and others, and you will find that it  was a warfare for them all the way  through. And so with Jesus and the  Apostles. But all those dispensa-  tions have passed and gone into the  spirit world, and they have their eyes  upon us, and in fact God our heavenly  Father and all under him—the whole  heavenly host, have their eyes turned  towards the Latter-day Saints, be-  cause this is the great dispensation  of which Adam, Enoch and all the  ancient patriarchs and Prophets have  spoken,  in which shall take place the  final redemption of the House of  Israel, the restoration of their king-  dom, the rebuilding of their city and  Temple, the restoration of their  oracles and Priesthood, of the Urim  and Thummim, and the preparation  for the final winding up scene in the  last days; all these things will take  place in the dispensation in which we  are permitted to live.    Let us, then, try and fulfill and  perform our duties as good Latter-day  Saints. Let us bear with each other's  faults, and bear the yoke of Christ,   live our religion and keep the com-  mandments of God. Let us try and  bring up our children in the nurture  and admonition of the Lord. Let  us set them good examples and teach  them good principles while they are  young. They are given to us by our  heavenly Father; they are our king-  dom, they are the foundation of our  exaltation and glory; they are plants  of renown, and we should strive to  bear them up before the Lord, and  teach them to pray to, and to have  faith in, the Lord as far as we can,  that when we are past and gone  and they succeed us on this stage of  action, they may bear off the great  latter-day work and kingdom of God  upon the earth. I do not believe  that the day is very far distant when  the revelations which God has given  concerning the last days will have  their fulfillment. I believe there are  many children now living in the  mountains of Israel who will never  taste death, that is, they will dwell  on the earth at the coming of the  Lord Jesus Christ. I will acknowledge  that there is a great deal to be done,  and the Lord has not revealed to man  the day or the hour, but he has re-  vealed the generation; and the fig  trees are now putting forth their  leaves in the eyes of all the nations,  indicating the near approach of the  second coming of the Son of Man.   It is my faith that hundreds and  thousands of the children that have  been given to us will be alive in the  flesh when Christ comes in the clouds  of heaven in power and great glory.  The Lord will not disappoint the  inhabitants of the earth in these last  days in regard to his second coming,  any more than he has with regard to  other great events and dispensations. 
 JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.    We live in a very different age  and generation; we live in the day  and time when God has set his hand  to fulfill a measure of prophecy and  revelation to man, in the great dis-  pensation of all dispensations. As  an individual I do not believe that  many more years will roll over the  heads of the inhabitants of the earth  before the resurrection will be upon  them, and then these children,  which we are called to bury to-day,  will come forth from their graves,  clothed with glory, immortality, and  eternal life. You may ask why I  believe this. I believe it because the  revelations of God say so. I read  the Scriptures, and I believe that the  revelations and prophecies therein  contained mean what they say, and  I also believe that the saying of  every Prophet or Apostles spoken  under the inspiration of the Holy  Ghost will have its fulfillment, and,  as Paul said, no prophecy of Scripture  hath any private interpretation, but  holy men of old spake as they were  moved upon by the Holy Ghost. ##2 Peter 1: 20-21##  They spake the mind and word of  the Lord, and none of their sayings  will fail to be fulfilled, for the Lord  has said—"Though the heavens and  the earth pass away, my word shall  not fail, but shall be fulfilled." ##Doctrine & Covenants 56:11## That  is the way I read prophecy and reve-  lation.    The Jews will be moved upon by  and by, and they will return to the  land of their fathers, and they will  rebuild Jerusalem. These Laman-  ites here will receive the Gospel of  Christ in fulfillment of the revela-  tions of God. The Prophets which  have been shut up in the north coun-  try with the nine and a half tribes  led away by Shalmanezer, King of  Assyria, thousands of years ago, will  come and remembrance before God;  they will smite the rocks and moun-  tains of ice will flow down before  them, and those long lost tribes will  come forth in your day, and mine, if  we live a few years longer, and they  will be crowned, under the hands of  the children of Ephraim—the Elders  of Israel, who dwell in the land of  Zion. And by and by the testimony  of the Gospel will be sealed among  the Gentiles, and the Gospel will  turn to the whole house of Israel,  and the judgments of God will back  up the testimony of the Elders of  this Church, and the Lord will send  messengers who will go forth and  reap down the earth. The unbeliever  may say that what we term judg-  ments have always prevailed more or  less among the nations, and that  God has nothing to do with them,  they are all natural. Well, if they  have always prevailed, they will pre-  vail to a greater extent in these last  days than ever before, until every-  thing that God has spoken shall have  come to pass. Judgments await the  world, and they await this nation,  and the day is at hand when the  Lord will sweep the earth as a  besom of destruction. In the vision  which the Lord gave to Enoch, he  saw the heavens weeping over the  earth because of the fall of man; and  when Enoch asked the Lord—"When  will the earth rest from under the  curse of sin?" the Lord told him  that in the last days the earth should  rest, for then it should be redeemed  from the sin, wickedness and abomi-  nations that were upon it. The  earth is now pretty near ripe, and  when ripened the Lord will cut them  off. These things are before the  Latter-day Saints, but the world do  not believe in them any more than  they believed in the message of Noah  or Lot.    Brethren and sisters, let us read  the revelations of God for ourselves,  and when we read them, let us be-  lieve them, and try to live in such a 
 LITTLE CHILDREN ARE INNOCENT, ETC.    way that we may be ready for what-  ever dispensation the Lord may have  in store for us, and so that we can  acknowledge his hand as Job did,  and not find any fault with him be-  cause of his providence is towards us.  If we cannot comprehend them now,  we shall be able to do so in a little  while. The Lord may have purposes  in view in his dealings with us that  we do not understand; I presume he  has. In fact, the whole of the deal-  ings of God to man are a mystery.  There is a vail over the earth, and  it is ordained of God that it should  be so, for if it were not so, and if  men could comprehend eternal things,  as God comprehend them, there is  no man on earth, no matter how  wicked he may be, but what would  be willing to keep the commandments  of God, and to pass through any-  thing that God ordained, for therein  he would see there was salvation and  eternal life. But God has an order  in these matters, as he revealed unto  Joseph Smith. He said unto Joseph  —"I will prove you whether you  will abide in my covenant; if you  are not willing to abide in my covenant  even unto death, you are not worthy  of me." ##Doctrine & Covenants 98:14-15## And it is so with the Saints.  If they are not willing to abide in  the covenants they have made with  God, even unto death if necessary,  they are not worthy of him. Jesus  laid down his life to redeem the  world, and passed through suffering  and affliction all his life in order that  he might fulfill the mission which  was given him. So it is with us.  The Lord says—"I am going to  prove the children of men." There  are a few individuals in this dispen-  sation who will inherit celestial glory,  and a few in other dispensations;  but before they receive their exalta-  tion they will have to pass through  and submit to whatever dispensation  God may decree. But for all this  they will receive their reward—they  will become Gods, they will inherit  thrones, kingdoms, principalities and  powers through the endless ages of  eternity, and to their increase there  will be no end, and the heart of man  has never conceived of the glory that  is in store for the sons and daughters  of God who keep the celestial law.  And yet God has a veil over all in  regard to these things. The whole  world will be judged according to the  deeds done in the body, and they will  inherit kingdoms according to the  laws which they have kept, every  man being preserved by the law  which he has observed, and all will  be saved in some glory, except the  sons of perdition.    Now, brethren and sisters, the  Gospel of Christ is before us. We  are all passing along, and it will only  be a little time before a good many  of us will be on the other side of the  vail. Our friends are passing off  every day, and we look in vain for  many with whom we have been fa-  miliar in years that are past. If I  go into a congregation of ten thou-  sand and enquire for the Saints I  knew in Kirtland, and request them  to lift up their hands, it will be like  a standard bearer on the mountains,  there is only here and there one.  You ask a congregation how many of  them knew Joseph Smith, and it is   only here and there one, they are  passing away to the other side of the  vail. It is so with us all, we are  hastening to the end of life's journey,  and a good many of us are on the  downward grade. I ask that what  little time I live, I may keep the faith  and have the fellowship of the Holy  Spirit and the Saints of God, that  when I get through I may be satis-  fied with life, satisfied with my acts,  that I may receive a welcome into the  Kingdom of God. That is all I ask  and all I labor for. As for riches and 
 JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.    wealth, I do not want them if they  will damn me. I would like to have  enough to clothe, shoe and feed my  wives and children, and to make them  comfortable, if I can get it honestly  before the Lord; but I would rather  myself and them be in poverty  than to have wealth and be destroyed.  Riches are dangerous unless we can  use them so as not to destroy us; if  we cannot use them to the glory of  God and for the building up of his  Kingdom, we are better without  them. I do not expect to live a great  many years longer. The young, the  middle-aged and the old are dying off.  For many years of my life the gospel  of Jesus Christ has been a consola-  tion to me.  I have spent a good deal  more than half of my life in laboring  in this Church. I labored to find this  Church, I may say, from my child-  hood up, and many a midnight hour  have I plead with the Lord, in the  wilderness, in the woods, and in my  mill, and under various circumstances,  that the Lord would let me find a  people who contended for the faith  once delivered to the Saints. I de-  sired this from reading the Bible, and  from the inspiration of the Holy  Spirit, for in the pages of that sacred  book I learned that a people once  lived upon the earth who had com-  munion with God, and they had  power to command the elements, and  they obeyed them; they conversed  with angels, and had the gifts and   graces of a religion which had power  and salvation in it. I could not find  this on the face of the earth. I  prayed to the Lord to let me live to  find such a people, and he promised  that I should, and I have lived to  find them. I have seen the faces of  Prophets and inspired men, and it  has been a great consolation to me.  I have my failings and imperfections,  and I expect that we are all subject  to them, more or less. I want to  overcome them, because I desire to  partake of eternal life. I also desire  this for the Saints of God and for the  honest and meek of the earth every-  where.    I have labored many years, and tra-  veled without purse or scrip, preach-  ed without money and without price,  for the purpose of saving my fellow-  men. I labor on Mount Zion to try  and save the dead; I spend a good  deal of time in this. It is a conso-  lation to me, I pray God my heaven-  ly Father to bless you and all the  Latter-day Saints, and that he will  give us enough of his Holy Spirit to  keep us in the path of duty and rec-  titude, virtue and righteousness, that  we may be justified before him. I   pray my heavenly Father that he will  bless Brother and Sister Wheeler in  their bereavement, and give them his  Holy Spirit, that, when they lie down  at night and rise in the morning and  miss their children they may feel to  commit themselves into the hands of  the Lord, and realize that their sepa-  ration from their little ones is not for  ever, but that in a little while they  will be restored to them. This ap-  plies to us all in the loss of our chil-  dren. We lay them away in the  grave, but they will come forth in the  morning of the resurrection, and if  we are faithful to the truth, we shall  receive them and rejoice with them;  and when we have passed through the  sorrows of mortality and have the joy  and glory of the celestial kingdom  conferred upon us we shall then know  that the afflictions of mortality have  prepared us for and enabled us to ap-  preciate the blessings which God has  in store for the faithful.    May God bless us, and give us his  Spirit, for Jesus' sake, Amen. 
 DISCOURSE BY PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF,    IN THE MEETING HOUSE, KAYSVILLE, DAVIS COUNTY, SUNDAY MORNING,  DECEMBER 10TH, 1882.    (Reported by John Irvine.)    HARDSHIP THE HERITAGE OF THE SAINTS—THE NECESSITY OF TRIAL  FORGIVENESS OF ENEMIES—INSPIRED DREAMS, "GET THE SPIRIT   OF GOD"—THE GREAT WORK EXPECTED OF THE SAINTS—LABORS   AMONG THE LAMANITES.    We have met again this morning   to hear and receive instruction and   worship the Lord and honor Him   upon this holy Sabbath day.    The heavens are full of knowledge,  full of instruction, full of revela-  tion and of principle and decree,   and I may say of judgment, all to be   made use of in their day and time,  and we have a right to all the know-  ledge, all the revelation, all the   principles of truth, that we can   claim by faith and diligence in serv-  ing the Lord and in the performance   of our duty.    I look upon the Latter-day Saints  as occupying a position, I may say   equal, at least, to that occupied by   the people of any other dispensation   that God has ever given to man.  We are a blessed people; we are   favored of heaven and have received   at the hands of our heavenly Father   a great many blessings both of the   heavens and of the earth, and we, as   a people, should be grateful to the   Lord our God for the many kind-  nesses He has bestowed upon us.   We live, in fact, in the dispensation   of the fullness of times, the last 
 dispensation in which the Lord will   reveal his mind and will to the in-  habitants of the earth, the last time   in which the Lord will prune his   vineyard, the last time in which he   will set up his kingdom upon the   earth, establish His Church, and   build up His Zion, to prepare for the   coming of the Son of Man. And  while we sometimes feel and have   felt in days that are past and gone,   to complain because we meet with   oppression, persecution and afflic-  tion, yet I wish to say to my breth-  ren and sisters that these things are   the heritage of the Saints of God.  Any people whom God calls will   meet with opposition from those  who will not receive the Gospel of   Jesus Christ. This has been the   legacy of the Saints of God in every   age from Father Adam down to   our own day. Those that live   godly in Christ Jesus must suffer   persecution. I believe myself,   from the reading of the revelations   of God, that it is necessary for a   people who are destined to inherit   the celestial kingdom to be a tried   people. I have never read of the   people of God in any dispensation   passing through life, as the secta-  rian world would say, on flowery   beds of ease, without opposition of   any kind. I have always looked   upon the life of our Savior—who   descended beneath all things that   He might rise above all things—as   an example for His followers. And   yet it has always, in one sense of the   word, seemed strange to me that   the Son of God, the First Begotten   in the eternal worlds of the Father,  and the Only Begotten in the flesh,  should have to descend to the earth   and pass through what He did—  born in a stable, cradled in a manger,  persecuted, afflicted, scorned, a hiss   and bye-word to almost all the world,   and especially to the inhabitants of   Jerusalem and Judea. There was   apparently nothing that the Savior  could do that was acceptable in the   eyes of the world; anything and   almost everything he did was imputed   to an unholy influence. When He   cast out devils the people said he   did it through the power of Beelze-  bub, the prince of devils; when he   opened the eyes of the blind, the   Pharisees and priests of the day told   the man to "give God the glory; we   know this man is a sinner." And   so all his life through, to the day of   his death upon the cross. There is   something about all this that ap-  pears sorrowful; but it seemed   necessary for the Savior to descend   below all things that he might   ascend above all things. So it has   been with other men. When I look   at the history of Joseph Smith, I   sometimes think that he came as   near following the footsteps of the   Savior—(although no more so than   his disciples)—as any one possibly   could. Joseph Smith was called   to lay down his life; he sealed his   testimony with his blood, and passed   through some serious trials and   afflictions. In section 122 of the   Book of Doctrine and Covenants—  the word of the Lord given to the   Prophet while in Liberty jail—the  Lord showed him his condition   and position. He refers there   to the trials and troubles he was   called to pass through, and then   compares them with what He Him-  self (the Savior) had to endure. He   says: ##[Doctrine and Covenants 122:7-9]## "And if thou shouldst be cast   into the pit, or into the hands of   murderers, and the sentence of death   passed upon thee; if thou be cast   into the deep; if the billowing surge   conspire against thee; if fierce winds   become thine enemy; if the heavens   gather blackness, and all the ele-  ments combine to hedge up the way;  and above all, if the very jaws of 
 ##[Doctrine and Covenants 122:7-9]## hell shall gape, open the mouth   wide after thee, know thou, my Son,  that all these things shall give thee   experience, and shall be for thy   good. The Son of man hath de-  scended below them all; art thou   greater than He? Therefore, hold   on thy way, and the Priesthood   shall remain with thee, for their   bounds are set, they cannot pass.  Thy days are known, and thy years   shall not be numbered less; there-  fore, fear not what man can do, for   God shall be with you for ever and   ever." The Lord showed him in   this revelation that these afflictions   were necessary. We have been   called to pass through trials many   times, and I do not think we should   complain, because if we had no trials   we should hardly feel at home in   the other world in the company of   the Prophets and Apostles who were   sawn asunder, crucified, etc., for the   word of God and testimony of Jesus   Christ.    How should we feel towards our   enemies? President Taylor of late   has called upon us, to exercise   towards them the same spirit that   was manifested by our Savior upon   the cross: "Father forgive them  they know not what they do." We   should endeavor to exercise that   spirit. Our persecutors, those who   would seek to destroy us, do not   know what they do. They do not   comprehend us at all. Why, bless   your souls, if the veil was lifted from  off the eyes of the President of the   United States, from off the eyes of   the members of the Congress of the   United States, and from off the eyes   of our enemies, if this veil were   lifted they would bow before the   Lord and plead for these "Mor-  mons;" they would do this if their   eyes were open to see the future   consequences of taking a stand  against this Church and kingdom.  But there is a veil over their eyes,   because of their works of evil; and   the day will come when all peoples   will mourn who take a stand against   the kingdom of God, the Zion of   God, the Church of God, and the   Lord's anointed; unless they repent   they will, when they pass into the   other world, go into outer darkness,   where there is weeping and wailing   and gnashing of teeth. It is impos-  sible, however, for the Saints of God   to inherit a celestial kingdom with-  out their being tried as to whether   they will abide in the covenants of   the Lord or not.    Well, I feel we are a blessed peo-  ple. We have prospered. The   Lord is fighting our battles. The   Lord holds the destiny of this nation   and all other nations in His hands.  Our enemies can go no further than   He permits them.    We live in a day and time when   the Lord has decreed to set up his   kingdom for the last time upon the   earth. That is the reason we have   the privilege of building these   Temples and these meeting-houses   in the mountains of Israel. The   Lord has set his hand to establish   his kingdom according to his for-  mer promises, and it is going to   prevail upon the earth. He has   told us to fear not our enemies;   that though earth and hell combine   against us, they shall not prevail,  if we are built upon the rock of   Christ.    We have come to this earth upon a   mission; and we have been gathered   to the valleys of these mountains   that we may be taught and in-  structed in the things of God; that  we may magnify our calling before   the Lord; that we may become saviors   upon Mount Zion; that we may   have power to go forth and warn the   nations of the earth. I look upon   the mission of the Latter-day Saints 
 as being as important as that of any   people that ever lived in any age of   the world. I have often expressed   my views with regard to this. As   Elders of Israel, very few of us fully   comprehend our position, our calling,   or relationship to God, our responsi-  bility, or work the Lord requires at   our hands. The Lord has given unto   us the Priesthood. This is conferred   upon us that we may administer in   the ordinances of life and salvation.  But to enable us to perform our   duties acceptably, there is one thing   we need, one and all of us, and that   is the Holy Spirit. While in Winter   Quarters, President Young had a   dream in which the Prophet Joseph   Smith appeared to him and said:  "Brother Young, you exhort this   people to obtain the Holy Spirit;   with it they can do anything that   is necessary; without it they cannot   build up the kingdom of God." In   one of my dreams while in Arizona,   I had the same admonition from  President Young. I thought he   was attending one of our confer-  ences. I said to him: "Can you   speak to us?" "No," he replied, "I   have done bearing my testimony in   the flesh; I have merely come to see   the people, to see you, to see what   you are doing. But I want you to   teach the Latter-day Saints to labor   to obtain the Holy Spirit. It is   one of the most important gifts that   the Saints of the living God can   possess. You all need this," he   said, "in order to build up Zion. If   you have not this Spirit—the Spirit   of the Holy Ghost, the testimony of   Jesus, the testimony of the Father   and Son—you cannot get along.  But if you are in possession of this   Spirit, your minds will be open to  comprehend the things of God."  This is true. There is not a man in   this Church and kingdom to-day,   who, if he is in possession of this   spirit, will set his heart upon the   things of this world. Any man that   loves the world, the love of the   Father is not in him. We have   received something better than the   love of gold, silver, houses and   lands; we have received the   promise of eternal life. We have   had conferred upon us the eternal   Priesthood by which our heavenly   Father has created all worlds and   redeemed all worlds and has per-  formed all his works from eternity   to eternity.    Then, we should labor to obtain   this Spirit while we are upon the   earth that we may overcome every   evil. We have a mighty warfare on   hand. We have to contend against   the world, the flesh and the devil.  There are temptations that surround   every man and woman, that is, if   they attempt to keep the command-  ments of God, and no man or woman   can inherit eternal life without   passing through this warfare in the   flesh. Other generations have had   their turn. As a people it is our   turn to-day. The old patriarchs  and prophets have gone, their mis-  sions are ended, so far as their testi-  mony in the flesh is concerned; but   they were valiant in the testimony   of Jesus Christ; they kept the law,  and they will inherit a celestial   glory.    I often reflect upon the promises   made concerning the Priesthood.  The Lord, in a revelation upon this   subject, says, ##Doctrine and Covenants 84:33-41|Doctrine and Cove-  nants, 33rd to 41st verses##: Whoso-  ever is faithful unto obtaining these   two Priesthoods of which I have   spoken, and the magnifying their   calling, are sanctified by the spirit   unto the renewing of their bodies.   . . . All that my Father   hath shall be given unto him.  Therefore, all those who receive the   Priesthood, receive this oath and 
 ##[Doctrine and Covenants 84:33-41]## covenant of my Father, which he   cannot break, neither can it be   moved." Now, I sometimes ask   myself the question, Do we compre-  hend these things? Do we compre-  hend that if we abide the laws of the   Priesthood we shall become heirs of   God and joint-heirs with Jesus   Christ? I realize that our eyes have   not seen, our ears have not heard,   neither hath it entered into our   hearts to conceive the glory that is   in store for the faithful. We are   placed in a position to be proven and   tried; we must be, we have been, we   shall be, until we get through with   our labors in the flesh. The Lord   told Joseph Smith that he would   prove us in all things, whether we   will abide in his covenant, even   unto death, that we may be found   worthy: "for if we will not abide in   his covenant, we are not worthy of   him." Jesus Christ abode in the   covenant; he kept all the com-  mandments while he was upon the   earth. He even was baptized by the   hands of John, although it was   not for the remission of sin, but to   fulfill all righteousness. There was   no part of the Gospel that Christ   did not fulfill, and he called upon   Joseph Smith to fulfill the same.  This he did. He laid down his life.  He went to the spirit world, and he   is there watching over this people.  He has power there, and so have our   brethren who have gone to the other   side of the veil. They are laboring   for us. They are watching to see   how we perform the work left to our   charge.    I hope we live our religion. I   hope we strive to keep the command-  ments of God. We occupy a very   important position in the world.  There are very few of the inhabitants   of the earth who are laboring to   build up Zion. There are very  few, apparently, who are able to   abide the law of God. There are   very few who are willing to sacrifice   anything for eternal life and salva-  tion, and thousands will have to   inherit a kingdom other than the   celestial.    Nevertheless, my brethren and   sisters, we are laboring and progress-  ing in this work. Zion is advancing;   the kingdom of God is rolling on.  The progress of this kingdom has   never stopped from the day of its   organization; it never will until   it has accomplished all for which it   has been organized and established   on the earth to accomplish. We  have a great work to do. We are   commanded to preach the Gospel to   the nations of the earth. The   Elders of Israel have been doing this   for the last fifty years.  We are still   doing it, in the United States and   other parts of the world. We shall  continue to labor among the Gen-  tiles just as long as the Lord says   we must do so. But at the same   time we have now been commanded   to turn to a branch of the house of   Israel. Here are the Lamanites,  thousands and thousands of them  surround us. They look to us for   the Gospel of Christ. It is our duty   to go to them and organize them,  and preach to them the words of life   and salvation.    Then, again, we have temples to  build in our day and time, that we   may go into them and do a work   both for the living and the dead.  Our mission is more extended and   extensive than we realize. There   have been no Prophets, no Apostles,  upon the earth for the last 1,800  years, that we are much acquainted   with, except Nephi, who dwelt upon   this continent several hundred years  after the death of Christ. There   has been no one upon the earth   with authority to preach the Gospel  to the nations of the earth. Many 
 generations have passed away.    Many thousands of millions have   passed into the spirit world. We   are now at the end of the sixth   thousand years. We are bordering   upon the millennium. We are living   in the great and last dispensation,   in the which the God of Israel ex-  pects us, his servants, his sons and   daughters, to perform the work   which has been left to our charge.  It is our duty to build these temples.  It is our duty to enter into them   and redeem our dead. Joseph Smith   is preaching to the spirits in prison;  so are all the Elders who have died  in the faith. There are millions  of them there, and they must have   the Gospel offered to them. Joseph   Smith and others cannot baptize the   spirits in water, it is not the law;   but their posterity, their sons and  daughters who are living in the last   dispensation, are expected to go into   these temples and there redeem  their dead. This is a good work,   and it is a great blessing for men and   women to have this privilege. We  have one of these temples finished,   and we are doing a great work in   that temple. A hundred and sixty-  two thousand persons have been   baptized for the dead, and nearly   seventy thousand endowments have   been given in that temple. We   have only just begun this work.  We want the Logan temple finished,  as also the temple at Manti, that   the people may go forth and redeem  their dead. Our forefathers are   looking to us to attend to this work.  They are watching over us with   great anxiety, and are desirous that   we should finish these temples and   attend to certain ordinances for   them, so that in the morning of the   resurrection they can come forth   and enjoy the same blessings that   we enjoy. We are living in the   flesh and have the privilege of receiv-  ing the Gospel of Christ for our-  selves. Our forefathers had not   this privilege; and as their   posterity when we meet them in   the spirit world we shall have the   joy and satisfaction of knowing   that we did our duty by them while   here upon the earth. We occupy   a position in this capacity towards   them the same as we do to this  generation. We occupy the po-  sition of Saviors upon Mount   Zion.    There are a great many things I   might mention that are of interest   to the Latter-day Saints. We should  humble ourselves before the Lord.  We have been called to set our   houses in order, that we should seek   to obtain the spirit of the Lord that   it may enable us to magnify our   callings in the Priesthood. We are   under great responsibility. It won't   pay to apostatize; "there is no money   in it." Any man who receives this   Priesthood and tastes of the word of   God, and of the powers of the world   to come—any man that turns away  from these things, apostatizes, and   turns away from the Church of   God, shall not, in accordance with   the revelations of the Lord to Joseph   Smith, "have forgiveness of sins in  this world nor in the world to   come."    The Lord is laboring for his   kingdom. In his hands he holds the   destiny of this people and of this   generation, and if we will do our   duty he will sustain and uphold us   and Zion will not be moved out of   her place. I am anxious to see the   Latter-day Saints rise up and mag-  nify their calling. We (the Twelve   Apostles, Seventies and others) are   called to go forth to preach the Gos-  pel to the Lamanites and organize   them. I am glad of it. I have felt   for a long time that we should turn   our attention to them. They are the 
 literal descendants of Abraham,  Isaac and Jacob, and the Lord is   working in their midst. The vision   of their minds is beginning to be   opened, and they are to be taught   the things of the kingdom of God. I   have thought sometimes that they   have more faith than the Latter-  day Saints. I traveled among them   for one year in Arizona and New  Mexico. I visited those that dwell   in the walled cities. They have some   seven villages on the top of a moun-  tain from 500 to 1,500 feet high.  One thing struck me very forcibly   while there. Although a good many   of these people are superstitious,  some of them sun-worshippers and   so forth, yet they seem to be im-  pressed with the idea that there is go-  ing to be a famine. They have enough   grain and dried squash laid up to   last them for years, and they think  the day is not far off when they will  need that which they have stored up.  Don't we believe that a famine will  come? I know some of our sisters   are laying up wheat, I hope the   Relief Societies will continue to do   so, and the brethren should help   them. I believe that the Latter-  day Saints ought to store up grain   against a day of want. The Bible  tells us that prior to the coming of   the Son of Man there shall be wars   and rumors of wars, famines, pes-  tilence, and earthquakes. All these   things will come to pass.    It is a good time with us. The  Lord has blessed us. He has blessed   the earth for our use; and we ought   to dedicate our families, our fields,  our crops, our herds, to God. We   should pay our tithing according to   the law of God. We should attend   to all the duties required at our   hands. We should not neglect our   prayers. Men should seek to enjoy   the spirit of God, and the fellowship  of His Holy Spirit. We should seek   to do all the good we can, so that we   may feel satisfied when we get   through.    I pray God to bless you with His  Holy Spirit; I pray that he will   give us power to fulfill our calling in   the Priesthood, power to build up  Zion, power to finish these temples  in which we may redeem our dead.  This is my prayer in the name of   Jesus Christ. Amen. 
 146 JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.    THE PEOPLE ASLEEP--THOSE HOLDING THE PRIESTHOOD MUST MAG-  NIFY THEIR CALLINGS OR BE REMOVED--THE SAINTS TO BE TRIED   EVEN UNTO DEATH.    Remarks by Elder Wilford Woodruff, Delivered in the Tabernacle, Great Salt Lake City,  December 21, 1856.    We have some few missionaries re-  turned very recently, and I wish to   notify them to meet with us on Tues-  day evening in the Seventies' Council  Hall; and we want all the Bishops   in the city, and the missionaries who  have been apppointed to labor here,   to meet at the same place, on the  same evening.    I attended the High Priests' meet-  ing last evening, in company with   brothers F. D. Richards and Lorenzo  Snow, and I want to say to all the   High Priests in this city, I want them   to meet with their quorum; and we  are going to meet with you; the   Twelve will meet with you and with  the Seventies, and I want every man  who is a president of Seventies to  meet with his quorum at the time  appointed.  There was not more than   half the High Priests out last evening.    We are called upon to wake up and  reform, and it makes me feel curious   when I go into the High Priests'  meeting, and see not one half of them  there when a meeting is held to pre-  pare them to wake up the people.    I want this people to listen to what   they have heard to-day. I feel thank-  ful to see brother Kimball again come  into this stand. I expressed my feel-  ings when I saw the sacrament re-  moved from the table; I felt that it   was a loud sermon to this people; I  said I knew not what would come   next; I thought likely the Presidency  would be removed next from us, not  that I expected they would die; bro-  ther Grant, however, is gone; the   load he undertook to draw killed him,  the same load that was pressing the  President of this Church to the earth,   when Jedediah rose up to bear it off;   his spirit was strong enough, but as  brother Kimball said, his mortal body  was not strong enough to bear its  weight. The First Presidency have  not addressed this people but a little  time since the sacrament was removed,   therefore I was glad to see and hear  brother Kimball to-day.    Although Jedediah has been taken  from us, that load, which in a measure  has been removed from the Presi-  dency of this Church, has not return-  ed unto them, and I pray it never   may. When Jedediah M. Grant went  forth among the people through the  north country and this city to carry  out the views of President Young,   and lifted up his voice like the trump  of the angel of God, and called upon  the people to awake out of their deep   sleep and repent of their sins and   turn unto God, the people were so  sound asleep that they did not realize  the importance of his mission; many  felt that his labors and reproofs were  unnecessary and uncalled for, the peo-  ple did not know what he was doing.  Had the vision of their minds been  open as was brother Grant's, and those  who sent him, they would have seen   and felt the importance of that mission.    I tell you the people have been  asleep, and they are not yet half   awake, they have not more than one  eye open, and not that quite; when   we hear such things as we have to- 
 THE PEOPLE ASLEEP, ETC. 147    day, this people have got to wake up  to righteousness. I have lived twenty-  three years in the Church, and I have  been acquainted with Prophets and  have heard them prophesy, and I   have not yet seen their words fall to  the ground unfulfilled; and when they   speak Israel should hear and obey.    We have been called upon, some   of us, as missionaries to the people of  this city, to wake them up. We shall   be among you, brethen, and we do   not intend to let you sleep. Brother  Orson Hyde is with us to-day; he has  had a dream which refers to the wheat  and the thrashing floor. I am glad   brother Hyde is with us, and I want  to say to you brother Hyde, in the   name of the Lord, wake up and rise  up in the midst of your brethren the  Twelve, and lead them forth into the  field of labor, and we will stand by   you; if you will lead the Twelve,   brother Hyde, in the spirit and power   of your calling as an Apostle of  Jesus   Christ, you will see your brethren by   your side; we will back you up, and  step forth and help to bear that   mighty load which has rested upon   the Presidency of the Church like a   mountain, and nearly crushed them  to the ground.  As a Quorum we have  got to more fully obtain the spirit and   power of our Apostleship and take   more upon ourselves the care and   burthen of the Church and Kingdom   of God than we have done.    The Twelve Apostles have got to  rise up and magnify their calling, or  they will be removed out of their   place. The High Priests, the Seven-  ties, the Bishops, and every other   Quorum of the Church and King-  dom of God have got to do the same,  or they also will be removed; we can-  not sleep any longer with the Priest-  hood of Almight God resting upon  us, and the work that is required at  our hands. WE CANNOT SLEEP.   I do not wonder that calling on the  people to wake up has killed one man,   and it will kill more if we do not re-  spond to the call; mortality cannot   endure the visions of eternity that  rests on them when they look on the  Priesthood and see the position they   are in; it has nearly laid brother   Young in the grave; he felt he could  not live until some man rose up and  started the work of reformation.    I know it is my duty to wake up   and enter into the labors of my call-  ing, and it is the duty of Elder Hyde,  and the duty of every other man in   Israel that bears this Priesthood to  do the same; it is our duty to bear   off that burden and labor which has  been resting like a mountain upon   the leaders of this Church. I know   they have groaned under the load that  has rested on them, when they have   seen all Israel going to sleep.    Let the Twelve Apostles, and the  Seventy Apostles, and High Priest  Apostles, and all other Apostles rise up  and keep pace with the work of the  Lord God, for we have no time to sleep.  What is man's life good for, or his   words or work good for when he stands  in the way of men's salvation, exalta-  tion, and glory?  They are of no use at all.    As an individual I am determined   to wake up and do my duty, God   being my helper. I want to see bro-  ther Hyde, who is the President of   the Twelve, walk into all these Quo-  rums and attend their meetings, and   we will back him up; I want him to   lift up his voice like a trumpet and go  to winnowing the wheat; it is for the  Twelve to rise up and carry off the   load. The Seventies have got to walk   up in their place and do their duty.   I know God requires this at our   hands. The law of God, the holy  Priesthood, and the holy anointing  and washing, and everything else   that is holy requires it at our hands.  I know this.    It is necessary to reform. The   question may be asked, what is the   matter? Why, we are asleep; if the 
 148 JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.    eyes of any man or woman is opened   as they should be, they could see the  things of God as they are in one mo-  ment; they would see there is a   necessity of waking up and doing  something. Here is a great and   mighty dispensation committed  into the hands of this people for the living  and the dead; the candle of the Lord  God is placed in these mountains   like a city that is set on a hill that  cannot be hid; the work is on your  shoulders, ye Priests of the Most  High God!--on you rests the salva-  tion of this generation, and the Lord   will require this stewardship at your   hands.    The Lord has given you the keys   of the Priesthood with all the bless-  ings pertaining to it--as great and as  mighty a work as ever was committed   to any man on the earth, and that too   in the midst of the last dispensation   and fulness of times. The Lord re-  quires us to prepare this generation,   both Jew and Gentile, either for sal-  vation or damnation through the   proclamation of the Gospel of Jesus   Christ and the administering of the  ordinances of the House of God,   and we go to sleep! The Apostles   go to sleep--the Seventies go to   sleep--the Elders of Israel close  their eyes to slumber, and we the   only people God has on the earth,   upon whose shoulders He has laid the  responsibility of performing this great   and mighty work!    Do you wonder that Prophets get   up here and chastise, and draw the   sword of justice and hold it over our  heads?  I do not. I wonder that our   children at the fireside do not rise up   and prophesy, with a voice like thun-  der and in flames of fire, unto their fa-  thers and mothers, and unto the people  of Israel. I know that the counsels we   have had here through the mouths of   the Prophets of God are just and true.   I know that the warning voice that   has been heard in this Stand, and the  call that has been made on this floor   is necessary; and I do hope and pray  God that we, as missionaries, will   listen to it. I want my brother mis-  sionaries in the first place to wake up,  and get aroused with the mantle of   salvation and Spirit of God ourselves,  and get our own armor bright. It has  been justly remarked here that we  have got to labor ourselves until we  get the Spirit of God, and then we   can walk out among the people and  correct them; but if we as Seventies,  as High Priests, and Apostles, and   Elders bearing the Priesthood, if we  are resolved to set our hearts upon   things of this earth, without being   engaged in the interest of the king-  dom of God, what can we expect of   the people? Not anything. I desire   that we may all wake up, and listen  to the counsel of these men who lead  us from day to day.    We have no time to lose to prepare   ourselves for the things that are com-  ing on the earth; and who wants to  lose his crown, his glory, and hope of   eternal lives that he has had in days   past and gone by receiving the Gospel  of Jesus Christ?  No man that has   any portion of the Spirit of God. Let  us rise up and magnify our calling,  and labor before God until we can get  the Holy Spirit, and until our prayers  rend the vail of eternity and enter   into the ears of the God of Sabbaoth  and be answered in blessings upon   our heads.    When shall the fire be kindled   in Zion?  I do not mean wild fire--  there is a true fire, and that is the  fire we need to get, that is necessary   to kindle; and if we live up to our   privileges, do our duty, walk up to   the word of the Lord God, and mag-  nify our calling, we do know that the  blessings of God will attend us, and   the sinners in Zion will tremble and   fearfulness will surprise the hypocrite;  and let what will come, all will be  right with the Latter-day Saints. 
 THE PEOPLE ASLEEP, ETC. 149    There are great things awaiting us  and the world--the Lord is withdraw-  ing His Spirit from the nations of the  earth, His sword is bathed in heaven  and will fall upon Idumea or the   world; the seals are about to be   opened and the judgments of God   poured out upon the wicked, for the   cup of their wickedness and abomina-  tions is filled to the brim and the   indignation of the Lord will be pour-  ed out without measure.    Let the Saints read the revelations  of God, and they will see that there  are important events at our doors.  Let us hearken and wake up, and be  doing the things required of us. Let  the missionaries first get their lamps   trimmed and burning, and then go   among the people, and go with the  Spirit of God and the salvation of the  Gospel of Jesus Christ; and let the   other Quorums do the same; and   when you do this you will see a re-  form, and sin and iniquity cannot   abide in our habitations, in our wards,  or in our city.    We have sin and sinners among us,   and what are we going to do about it?  Why, we are going to try to live our   religion, and when we do that we  shall do right. The business with  me is to do right to-day, to live my  religion to-day, and leave the events  with God; He holds the destinies of   the nations and of all men; they are  in His hand; He made the earth and   controls the children of men upon it.    Then let events roll on--if we are   only right, all is well. We have got   to be tried even unto death. The  Lord says He will prove us, and see   if we abide in His covenants. There  is where we have got to stand as a   people, not only our horses, and gold  and silver, and land and houses, but   our lives have got to lie on the altar,   and when anything comes to test us,  even at the stake of our lives, we   should be in the possession of the  Holy Ghost not to flee from it, and   such will be crowned with the gift of  eternal lives, exaltation and glory.    There is nothing to encourage a   man to draw back; there is nothing  short of the most damnable principle  that dwells in the spirit of devils that  would tempt any man to shed the   blood of the Lord's anointed, yet men   will try to do it. There are men here  to-day who will possess that spirit;   I believe it; they are in our city.  If  they shed blood they have got the bill  to pay.  Let the wicked and the un-  godly, who will not repent, but fight  against God, do their worst, their time   is short, and the day will come, and   that soon when they will be called to  judgment.    I remember what Joseph said, a   short time before he was slain in one  of the last sermons I ever heard him  preach. Said he, "Men are here   to-day who are seeking my blood, and  they are those who have held the Priest-  hood and have received their washings   and anointings; men who have received  their endowments." I saw the faces of  those men at that time, and they had   a hand in slaying the Prophet. There   are men who now possess the same  spirit and the same desire. There  are men here, too, that have faith,   that have the Priesthood and the   spirit of it, and they will do their  duty, and God will sustain them in   it, and He will sustain this Church and  kingdom; let the trials of the Saints  be what they will, the kingdom of   God is not to be torn down any more  at all--it will not again be taken from   the earth until it is prepared to re-  ceive Christ at his coming.    Let us prepare ourselves and do  our duty, and let the High Priests  and Seventies go to their meetings,  and before you go there, go to work   and get the Spirit of God, that when  you get there you may not freeze to  death. And I want to have the peo-  ple, when they come here, to get   enough of the Spirit of God, that 
 150 JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.    when the Presidency rise in this   Stand they may give us what is in   their hearts. They are filled with   blessings for this people. All the  trouble is our eyes have been closed,  we have been in a deep sleep; let us  wake up and attend to our duty, and  make it the first business we do.    Those who lay their plans in secret  chambers to seek the blood of the  Prophets, will have their case attend-  ed to by messengers on the other side  of the vail, ministers will be sent to  them who will render unto them a   righteous judgment there. I do not  want to preach to them here, but to   those who want to be saved.    Go to, and if you have not the  Spirit of God, make it your first busi-  ness to get it, that your minds may be  opened to see the things of God as   they are; it is your privilege and  mine, that we may be prepared for  what is to come.    That this people may repent of all  their sins and wake up, and have   power to come before God that their  prayers may be heard, be prepared to  defend the kingdom and never desert  their covenants and their brethren, or  betray the Gospel, but overcome the   world and be prepared to become joint  heirs with Christ to the fulness of the  first resurrection which is prepared   for those who keep the command-  ments of God, is my prayer in the   name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 
 INSPIRATION AND TEACHINGS OF THE SPIRIT.    Remarks by Elder Wilford Woodruff, made in the Tabernacle, Great Salt Lake City;  Sunday Morning, March 22, 1857.    When any of the Presidency of   this Church, or of the Quorum of the   Twelve, or any of the Elders rise in   this stand to speak, this people look  unto them, and expect they will enjoy   the Holy Spirit sufficiently to say   something that will edify them. The   people almost unanimously look for   this. I will say, on the other hand,   that the Presidency, the Twelve, and   the Elders who preach in this house   expect that the people will have the   Spirit of the Lord, that they may   come to understanding; and this is   just as much required that they may   comprehend what is said unto them,   as it is required of the breth-  ren who speak, to teach doctrine,   principle, truth, and the revelations   of Jesus Christ. When the minds of   the people are quickened and enlight-  ened by the power of God and the   gift of the Holy Ghost, that they can   appreciate and prize the principles of 
 increase and to govern us in our acts  among the children of men. Now,  when a man has the Holy Spirit and   hears the plain, simple truths of   salvation, they appear more valuable   than all else besides, and he is ready   to sacrifice everything of a temporal   nature to secure himself salvation; but   when people's minds become darkened,  they lose the Holy Spirit and the   value of that Gospel, and they do not   realize the privilege and the honour of   being associated with the Saints of   God in these valleys of the mountains,  neither do they maintain their alle-  giance to their Heavenly Father, and   honour his name upon the earth,   or prize their association with those   that bear the holy Priesthood, and   therefore they go into darkness. Why   has the word reformation ever been   named in Zion? It has been because   we did not labour to keep within us   that holy principle of life, that our   minds might be quickened day by day,  and receive and prize those truths   delivered unto us. Now we marvel   and wonder when we are enlightened   by the Spirit of God and the reve-  lations which he has given unto us;   and when we are aroused to a sense   of the importance of these things, we  then see the effect and the bearing   they will have upon us,—not only the   fitting of our minds to go into the   world of spirits, but to prepare us to   meet with our Father in heaven.  Now, we should live in that way and   manner that the Holy Spirit will dwell  with us, and so that we may be pre-  pared to receive those truths which   are daily delivered unto us by Presi-  dents Young, Kimball, Wells, or any   other man who rises up here to speak  unto us the words of life. We should  give attention to what is said. As  brother Kimball says, the man who   speaks to you from this stand is the   centre, and we should give him our   attention, prayers, and faith; and if we   do this we shall receive out of the  abundance of his heart those things   which will benefit us. It should be   our chief study to treasure up the   words of life, that we may grow in   grace, and advance in the knowledge   of God, and become perfected in   Christ Jesus, that we may receive a   fulness, and become heirs of God and   joint heirs with Jesus Christ.    The revelations of Jesus Christ   teach us that the Saviour was born in   the flesh; and the Father said that He   did not give him a fulness at first, but   continued from grace to grace until he   had received a fulness, and was called   the Son of God because he did not   receive a fulness at first. We in like  manner should seek with all our souls   to grow in grace, light, and truth, that   in due time we may receive a fulness.  The Lord has a great many principles  in store for us; and the greatest   principles which he has for us are the   most simple and plain. The first   principles of the Gospel which lead us   unto eternal life are the simplest, and   yet none are more glorious or im-  portant unto us. Men may labour to   make a great display of talent, learn-  ing, and knowledge, either in printing   or preaching. They may try to preach   the mysteries and to present some-  thing strange, great, and wonderful,  and they may labour for this with all   their might, in the spirit and strength   of man without the aid of the Holy   Spirit of God, and yet the people are   not edified, and their preaching will   not give much satisfaction. It is the   plainest and the most simple things   that edify us the most, if taught by   the Spirit of God; and there is nothing   more important or beneficial unto us.  If we have that Spirit dwelling with   us—if it abides with us continually,   enlightening our minds by day and by   night, we are in the safe path; and  when we have finished the work of   the day, we reflect upon it and are   satisfied with it, feeling that it is   approbated of the Lord. It is our 
 privilege to live in this way, that all   our time may be spent so that we   have a conscience void of offence   towards both God and man. When   we reflect on the day that is past and   see wherein we have done evil, we   should labour to improve and to   advance in the things of the kingdom   of God. I feel that in order for us to   prize the gifts of God, the blessings   of the Gospel, the privilege that we   have of building tabernacles, and of   living here in peace, and kneeling   down in our family circles in peace,   having in our society the Prophets of   God, men filled with wisdom, who are   capable of leading us to salvation,   and of leading us into the paths of   life, who do teach us the principles of   truth, which will lead us back to our   Father and our God,—I say, when we  consider these things we ought to   prize our privileges as Saints of the   Most High. Brethren, we must in-  variably have the Spirit of God with   us, that we may ever be kept in the   line of our duty.    I feel to exhort you in regard to   these things, that we may prize those   blessings which God has given unto   us, and pursue a course wherein we   may be justified of the Lord. Now,   if we attempt to do anything that is   not right, the Spirit of the Lord will   not approbate us, but we shall feel  condemned. The Lord has blessed   us during the past winter; He has   poured out upon us a great amount of   knowledge, wisdom, and treasures,  that we ought to prize. Now, as the   spring is coming upon us, and as we   turn our attention to the plough and   to cultivating the earth, if we forget   our prayers, the Devil will take double   the advantage of us. We have re-  newed our covenants by baptism, and   we have received great blessings from  the Lord, and much of the Holy   Spirit has been shed abroad among   this people. And, as brother Richards   has said—and I consider the counsel  right—we should not only reprove our-  selves when wrong, but we should   reprove sin wherever we see it,   whether in ourselves, in our streets,   or in our quorums. We should always   show our disapprobation of those that   are wrong—that are sinful and wicked.    I do not feel, this morning, like   occupying a great portion of your time,  but I do feel that the Lord is gracious   unto us, and that we should prize   above all things upon the earth the   words of eternal life that are given   unto us. As long as we are governed   by the Holy Spirit, our minds are   strengthened, and our faith is and   will be increased, and we shall la-  bour for the building up of the king-  dom of God. And I pray that our   hearts may be inspired to magnify   our calling and the holy Priesthood,  and honour God, keep his command-  ments, and live our religion, which   I ask in the name of Jesus Christ.  Amen. 
 Bro Wilford Woodruff said Bro Snow has  given us good counsel this morning We should   take a course to save ourselves to day. The  Lord has said he would "prove us in all things" ##Doctrine & Covenants 98:14##  We have taken many Lessons for the past  25 years. we should make up our minds to make  the best use of the Lessons we are able to   We have a Years War, but it has been a  Bloodless Wone. Prest Buchanan nor   Congress does not know us. I believe that  Devil is a Christian & goes hand in hand with  all Christendom, he is a Gentleman—They would  put Jesus Christ or any of the old Prophets or apostles  to death if they were here, as they did anciently  We have confidence in God & we know he is  our friend & that he has sustained us  We have not violated the Laws of God or man  They are mad at us because we believe that  Joseph Smith was a Prophet & that B. Young  is his Successor. 
 The Army would have been swept out of existence  had it not been for those who lead this people  they are dictated by God, he rules all things for  the good of Zion & will do it – Let us make the  best use of the circumstances that surround us  We should learn to be wise be prudent in all  things. We took a vote a few months ago to  burn our houses & cut down our fruit trees  rather than have officers forced upon us contrary  to our wishes. We intend to do so yet  but do not apostatize if you have to go back  for the Lord may accept of our offering (i.e)  take the will for the deed. I think it would  be well for us to have Sutlers to trade with the  Soldiers for they have Sutlers to trade for them  You may just as well have confidence with God  if we please If we sell to our enemies let men  be appointed to trade with them—not evry one be  running to them & thereby get into a row with them  No one should be running to them for they are  afraid of being contaminated &by us & we are   afraid being contaminated by them so we are  agreed in this one thing. The Lord has a little more  power than the Devil. Let us make the best use  of the power that God has given us. We have  bore oppression many times & now we are  call'd upon to sustain the Constitution of the  U. S. we have done it & calculate to do it  No one to have any fears of the Mormons for we  are in the mountains & we can take care of ourselves  but they should have fear for themselves for the   judgements of God will soon be upon them  The cry is now Peace, Peace but we do not know  whether that army is going in to winter quarters  then it will do to talk about going back. But let  us not be to hasty. when our Leaders go back & say to  us Come back, then all right - Amen 
 Sunday Oct 17 [18]58 2 oclock    Bro Wilford Woodruff After so long a silence  I feel glad to speak to you how much I shall  say I know not the Question has often been aske  when shall we have any more Preaching. There has  been silence in gt S L City the voice of the Prophet  has not been heard of late Truth is Truth to day & will  be tomorrow the same Principles of Salvation remain  the same in every age. if you or I ever saw any beauty  in the gosple there is yet the same beauty yet, because  of this Silence it is no reason that we should not  live our religion those who wached over us once are  still watching over us, we should Sow the Truth in  all Sircumstances we are placed, there now seems  to be now a sifting time there has been a strong infl-  uance to Draw away men from the truth. god  has revealed the fullness of the gosple by an angel: the  greater the light the greater are our responsibilities there  has never been a generation greater Priviledged than  you this is a Dispensation of Dispensations god has  through Prophet that he would restore again the gosple  this is the same Holy Prieshood conferred upon Adam  and the Ancients. This was not revealed to our fathers  now because we have been placed in surcimstances shall  we partake of them such as gold and silver. great is  our condemnation if we turn away we profess to   have recieved a Dispensation of the Holy gosple  we have now. Preached to allmost every Nation under  heaven, & now shall we now turn away. I hope not  though I often hear of some turn away. Well every  man has he has his Agency yet god holds every man  ns responsable. not man ought leave the comm  andments of God.  it seems to me that this Church  is making great progress, has much the last 6 months  has it has any 6 months.

 FULFILMENT OF PROPHECY—POWER OF THE GOSPEL—  CONSISTENCY OF ITS PRINCIPLES.    Discourse by Elder WILFORD WOODRUFF, delivered in the Bowery, Great  Salt Lake City, July 27, 1862.    REPORTED BY J. V. LONG.    Brother Taylor gave us a very  interesting discourse this morning  upon the first principles of the Gospel,  contrasting them with the religion  of the Christian world, showing the  authority by which they administered  in different ages the ordinances of  religion according to the traditions  of their fathers. He remarked that  the Elders of this Church went forth  as the Apostles did in the days of   the Savior, promising to the people,  on conditions of obedience, the gift of  the Holy Ghost; and he remarked  that no other people would do that,  because they do not possess the  authority to do it.    I do not know that I can spend  the few moments that I may speak  here, better than to read a little on  the authority that we have for pur-  suing this course. This portion that

 I am going to read, is the word of  the Lord to the Church of Jesus  Christ of Latter-day Saints, as well  as to the whole world:    "Hearken, O ye people of my  church, saith the voice of Him who  dwells on high, and whose eyes are  upon all men; yea, verily I say,  hearken ye people from afar, and ye  that are upon the islands of the  sea, listen together; for verily the  voice of the Lord is unto all men,  and there is none to escape, and there  is no eye that shall not see, neither  ear that shall not hear, neither heart  that shall not be penetrated: and the  rebellious shall be pierced with much  sorrow, for their iniquities shall be  spoken upon the housetops, and their  secret acts shall be revealed; and the  voice of warning shall be unto all  people, by the mouths of my dis-  ciples, whom I have chosen in these  last days, and they shall go forth and  none shall stay them, for I the Lord  have commanded them.    "Behold, this is mine authority,  and the authority of my servants, and  my preface unto the book of my  commandments, which I have given  them to publish unto you, O inhabi-  tants of the earth: wherefore, fear  and tremble, O ye people, for what I  the Lord have decreed in them shall   be fulfilled. And verily, I say unto  you, that they who go forth, bearing  these tidings unto the inhabitants of  the earth, to them is power given to  seal both on earth and in heaven, the  unbelieving and rebellious; yea, verily,  to seal them up unto the day when the  wrath of God shall be poured out  upon the wicked without measure;  unto the day when the Lord shall  come to recompense unto every man  according to his work, and measure  to every man according to the mea-  sure which he has measured to his  fellow-man.    "Wherefore the voice of the Lord  is unto the end of the earth, that all  that will hear may hear: prepare ye,  prepare ye for that which is to come,  for the Lord is nigh; and the anger  of the Lord is kindled, and his sword  is bathed in heaven, and it shall fall  upon the inhabitants of the earth;  and the arm of the Lord shall be  revealed. And the day cometh that  they who will not hear the voice of  the Lord, neither the voice of his  servants, neither give heed to the  words of the Prophets and Apostles,  shall be cut off from among the people;  for they have strayed from mine ordi-  nances, and they have broken mine  everlasting covenant; they seek not  the Lord, to establish his righteous-  ness, but every man walketh in his   own way, and after the image of his  own god, whose image is in the  likeness of the world, and whose sub-  stance is that of an idol, which waxeth  old and shall perish in Babylon,   even Babylon the great, which shall   fall.    "Wherefore I, the Lord, knowing  the calamity which should come upon  the inhabitants of the earth, called  upon my servant Joseph Smith, jun.,  and spake unto him from heaven,  and gave him commandments; and  also gave commandments to others,  that they should proclaim these things  unto the world; and all this that it  might be fulfilled, which was written  by the Prophets; the weak things of  the world shall come forth and break  down the mighty and strong ones;  that man should not counsel his  fellow-man, neither trust in the arm  of flesh, but that every man might  speak in the name of God the Lord,  even the Savior of the world; that  faith also might increase in the earth;  that mine everlasting covenant might  be established; that the fulness of my  Gospel might be proclaimed by the  weak and the simple unto the ends  of the world, and before kings and  rulers.    "Behold, I am God and have 
 spoken it: these commandments are  of me, and were given unto my  servants in their weakness, after the  manner of their language, that they  might come to understanding, and  inasmuch as they erred it might be  made known: and inasmuch as they  sought wisdom they might be in-  structed; and inasmuch as they  sinned they might be chastened, that  they might repent: and inasmuch as  they were humble they might be made  strong, and blessed from on high, and  receive knowledge from time to time:  and after having received the record  of the Nephites, yea, even my servant  Joseph Smith, jun., might have power  to translate through the mercy of  God, by the power of God, the Book  of Mormon; and also those to whom   these commandments were given,  might have power to lay the founda-  tion of this church, and to bring it  forth out of obscurity and out of  darkness, the only true and living  church upon the face of the whole  earth, with which I, the Lord, am  well pleased, speaking unto the   church collectively and not individu-  ally, for I, the Lord, cannot look upon  sin with the least degree of allowance;  nevertheless, he that repents and does  the commandments of the Lord shall  be forgiven; and he that repents not,  from him shall be taken even the  light which he has received, for my  Spirit shall not always strive with  man, saith the Lord of Hosts.    "And again, verily I say unto you,  O inhabitants of the earth, I the  Lord am willing to make these things  known unto all flesh, for I am no  respecter of persons, and will that all  men shall know that the day speedily  cometh; the hour is not yet, but is  nigh at hand, when peace shall be  taken from the earth, and the devil  shall have power over his own domi-  nion, and also the Lord shall have  power over his Saints, and shall reign  in their midst, and shall come down  in judgment upon Idumea, or the  world.    "Search these commandments, for  they are true and faithful, and the  prophecies and promises which are in  them shall all be fulfilled.    "What I, the Lord, have spoken, I  have spoken, and I excuse not myself:  and though the heavens and the earth  pass away, my word shall not pass  away, but all shall be fulfilled,  whether by mine own voice or by the  voice of my servants, it is the same;  for behold and lo, the Lord is God,  and the Spirit bearth record, and  the record is true, and the truth  abideth forever and ever. Amen."—  -[See ##Doctrine and Covenants 1:34-39|Doc. & Cov., pages 65-68.##]-    What do you think of that revela-  tion, brethren? Does this look like  a Yankee scheme, or something made  up to cheat somebody? No, this is  the word of the Lord; it is a sermon  of itself. The Lord has sustained  that revelation from that day to the  present, and that is the reason why  brother Taylor and the Elders of this  Church go forth declaring the words  of life, and they know that they have  not taken this honor upon them-  selves, but that they were called of  God as was Aaron. [##Hebrews 5:4##] I do not care how  illiterate an Elder in this Church is,  if he has been faithful to his calling;  it is a matter I care but little about  if a man can neither read nor write, if  he has been called and ordained to the  Priesthood in this Church and king-  dom by Joseph Smith, or any of those  ordained by him to that Priesthood  which was given unto the Prophet by  Peter, James and John, who by com-  mandment came and ordained him to   the Melchisedec Priesthood. [##Doctrine and Covenants 128:20##] John the  Baptist held the Aaronic Priesthood,  and the authority commenced there,  and by those men that held the keys  of the kingdom of God in former dis-  pensations. It is that authority that  has inspired this; it is this that has  inspired the Elders of Israel from

 the commencement to the present  day.    Why should the Elders and people  now think it strange that those mes-  sengers who have gone forth, shoulder-  ing their knapsacks and travelling  thousands of miles to preach the  Gospel, should be the especial objects  of his favor? The Almighty has  proven them all the day long, and he  has been with them, and in fact there  has never been any portion of the  Priesthood officiating in sacred ordi-  nances but God has been with them.  In this revelation the Lord calls upon  his servants, and says, "I, the Lord,  am willing to make this known to  the children of men, that I have called  my servant Joseph, that the world  may be left without excuse."    Joseph Smith knew just as well as  the Lord knew that he was called of  God, and that he was called to per-  form a work for the redemption of  man. Has he ever disappointed any-  body when he has made a promise  to them? Has he ever disappointed  a Prophet or lawgiver in any age of  the world? No, never. But he has  declared that the heavens and the  earth shall pass away, but his word  shall never pass away, but that it  shall all be fulfilled. It is just so in  our day. All the words which the  Lord has spoken through his servants  will be fulfilled to the very letter,  whether those words are in reference  to the salvation of the righteous or  the condemnation of the wicked.  Christ had his mind upon this point  when he said, "Heaven and earth   shall pass away, but my words shall  not pass away."—##Matthew 24:35|Matthew xxiv, 35.##  Again, it is written, "For I will  hasten my word to perform it;" [##Jeremiah 1:12##] and  when the Lord spake through Isaiah  upon this subject he said. "So shall  my word be that goeth forth out of  my mouth: it shall not return unto  me void, but it shall accomplish that  which I please, and it shall prosper in  the thing whereto I sent it." [##Isaiah 55:11##] The  Elders go forth to preach the Gospel  to the nations of the earth, knowing  that the Lord will back up their word  by the power and demonstration of  the Holy Ghost.    There is but one Gospel, neither  will there be any other for the salva-  tion of this, nor of any other world  that we know of; but this we do  know that this Gospel preached in  any age of the world will produce the  same effect. We also know that any  man who receives this Priesthood,  and is faithful thereunto, will receive  the same blessings and power in any  and every age of the world. On this  account and for this reason, Utah—  the valleys of Deseret are being filled  with the children of men. The  Almighty has sent his servants to  preach the Gospel; they have not gone  upon their own authority: had they  done so, they might have called upon  the inhabitants of the earth till dooms-  day, and they would not have been suc-  cessful, but this land would still have  been a desert, occupied only by  Indians and wild beasts. But the  hand of God was with us, and hence  we had no fear of telling the people  our message, and now there are tens  of thousands who know the truth as  well as we do, for they have embraced  the Gospel and received this testimony  for themselves. There never was a  man that embraced this Gospel, but  has received this testimony of the  truth, if he has done so in sincerity  and in truth. The Lord has always  been ready to redeem his promise,  and in giving that testimony which  was necessary for the establishing of  them in the most holy faith.    The Lord has sustained us as a  people in all places and under all cir-  cumstances. We have gone forth as  sheep among wolves; among a people  full of tradition and superstition, and  we have had all these things to cope  with in our administrations among 
 the people, but the Lord was with us  wherever we went, backing up our   words by the testimony and power of  the Holy Ghost, and the people to  whom we administered received the  same testimony as had been given  unto us.    We are beginning to realize that  the things which the Lord has pro-  mised unto us thirty years ago are  now being fulfilled to the very letter.  Is there much peace in the world of  mankind? No, there is not: peace  is fast being taken from the children  of men. We are at peace in Utah,  but let me tell you that the Lord has  foretold by the revelations of Jesus  Christ all these things that are now  fulfilling before our eyes.    I copied a revelation more than  twenty-five years ago, in which it is  stated that war should be in the south  and in the north, and that nation  after nation would become embroiled  in the tumult and excitement, until  war should be poured out upon the   whole earth, and that this war would  commence at the rebellion of South  Carolina, and that times should be  such that every man who did not flee   to Zion would have to take up the  sword against his neighbor or against  his brother. These things are begin-  ning to be made manifest, but the end  is not yet; but it will come, and that  too much sooner than the world of  mankind anticipate, and all those  things spoken by the mouths of his  Prophets will be fulfilled.    We are gathering together here for  certain purposes understood and in  the mind of the Lord, one of which is  that we may be sanctified and pre-  pared for the great work of the future.  We have carried this work to the   various nations of the earth, and the  people to whom we have preached  have thought of us saying that there  was no other Gospel than that which  we had to proclaim, as was clearly and   demonstratively set forth to-day. The  Gospel of Jesus Christ is perfect in  all its parts. The words of the  Psalmist David will apply to our  religion, where he says:—"The law  of the Lord is perfect, converting the  soul: the testimony of the Lord is  sure, making wise the simple. The   statutes of the Lord are right, rejoic-  ing the heart: the commandment of  the Lord is pure, enlightening the  eyes. The fear of the Lord is clean,  enduring for ever: the judgments of  the Lord are true and righteous  altogether. More to be desired are  they than gold, yea, than much fine  gold: sweeter also than honey and  the honeycomb." [##Psalm 19:7-10##]    According to the vision of John  the Revelator, there are to be "six  hundred, threescore and six" [##Revelation 13:18##] false  sects of religion: how many of these  already exist is a matter of dispute  among theologists, but I suppose that  the number is nearly complete. Let  me now ask if you think things look  or indicate that these contending  creeds are all of God. It is certainly  not like the order carried out in the   days of Christ and his Apostles. It  is much more like the confusion of  the Pharisees, Essenes, Herodians,  Sadducees and Stoics, for they had  different creeds, principles and notions  by which they were governed, and it  is just so now with the sectarian  world. It is composed of every sect  and party that profess religion upon  the face of the earth. But the honest  in heart will be gathered out of all  these creeds and systems and be  brought home to Zion.    There have been thousands of men  and women who have listened to the  preaching of the Elders of this  Church, who have not embraced it  for fear of their good name; and  there have been many clergymen who  have listened attentively to the Elders  of Israel, and they have spent days  and nights in meditating upon the  things of God, and studying what to 
 do, realizing within themselves that  if they received this testimony they  would be dishonored in the eyes of  the world. They fear becoming a  hiss and a by-word among the children  of men in this generation. Hence the  majority of them have rejected it.    Many celebrated men have investi-  gated this subject, and far more of  them have had fears that it was true  than that it was false. I visited folks  in Long Island in 1837; I talked  with one minister named Newton, in  fact I stayed with him some twelve  days and preached the Gospel to him.  He attended meetings, and finally  became so that he could neither eat,  drink, nor sleep, he was so troubled  about the Gospel; but instead of em-  bracing it, sent after a minister who  lived on the south side of the island,  for the purpose of having me put  down or silenced. I persevered and  soon baptized most of the members of  Mr. Newton's church. Mr. Douglass,  a Methodist minister of the south side  of the island came, stayed a short  time and then returned. I followed  him home and succeeded in baptizing  most of his church; and instead of  these men getting any honor by  opposing me they were both brought  into disgrace. They lost their religion,  their church and members, and were  really disgraced. When I was there  last, one of them was in the Peni-  tentiary for one of the worst crimes  that a man can be guilty of, except  murder, and the other was travelling  the streets peddling small articles for  his bread. The chastening hand of  the Lord will always follow those  that oppose the truth of Heaven as  revealed through the Prophet of God.  This is in accordance with the experi-  ence of all our Elders. The Holy  Ghost has been with them to back up  their words, and I can say for all that,  we have not done a thing but it has  been backed up by the power of the  Almighty, so far as we have labored  for the upbuilding of the kingdom of  God.    In regard to holding office in the  Priesthood, I can truly say that I  never asked any man for any office in  this Church, and I believe I never  asked the Lord but once, and my  asking the Lord came about in this  way. I went up to Missouri in Zion's  camp; I saw the Prophet every day,  and I knew he was a Prophet of God.  About this time I had a great anxiety  to preach the Gospel; this desire  increased upon me, and I finally  resolved to ask the Lord to open my  way, so I went down into a hickory  grove and prayed, during which I  asked him to give me the privilege to  preach the Gospel. I prayed fervently  to the Almighty to give me the privi-  lege of preaching the Gospel of Jesus   Christ, and when I got through praying  I started for the place from whence I  came, and I had not walked more  than about forty rods before I met a  High Priest, and the first thing he  said to me was, "It is the will of the  Lord that you go and preach the  Gospel." I told him I was ready  and willing to do anything the Lord  required of me; I was therefore  ordained a Priest and sent to labor  in Arkansas.    I will now name a circumstance  which I have never named in public  before. I went into Arkansas, travel-  led a hundred miles out of my way  to see a man that had embraced the  Gospel some time before I went there.  He was full of wrath and indignation  when I went in; he railed against  Joseph Smith, Bishop Partridge and  Father Morley. The Lord showed  me the night before that I had  enemies in that town. I talked over  my feelings with the brother who  accompanied me, and he wanted to  leave the town, but I said no, I would  not go away, for I wanted to see what  the Lord wanted of me. All the  people were mad with rage, and we 
 could not get anybody to preach to;  in fact they were all full of rage till  they were mad with it. For some  time I could not see my way clearly,  but we finally called upon an old man  named Hubbard, and engaged to go  and clear timber. During the short  time that we were employed at that  the Lord sent me three times to visit  that old apostate, and each time when  I went there I could only bear testi-  mony to him of the truth of the  Gospel. When I went the third time  he followed me out of the house as  full of wrath as the Devil, and he had  not followed me more than about  eight rods when he fell dead at my  feet. This is a short story and a very  singular one.    At that time I had not power to  lay on hands for the gift of the Holy  Ghost, only holding the Aaronic  Priesthood, but the Lord sustained  me and his work just as well as if I  had been an Apostle. We baptized  father Hubbard and his wife, after  which we went on our way rejoicing.  The Lord has fed and sustained his  servants, and manifested his power  according to circumstances, and so he  will continue to do through life to all  that are faithful and true to their  covenants.    When the United States sent an  army to this land for our destruction,  the Lord had his eye upon us for  good and he delivered us from all our  enemies. The wicked have designed  our destruction from the first organi-  zation of this Church and kingdom,  but our leaders have been inspired by  the gift and power of God. Who  frustrated that army in their design?  The Lord our God; and now the  judgments that have come upon the  nation in consequence of their treat-  ment to this people, are a sore vexa-  tion to them, but it is the hand-dealing  of the Almighty and we cannot help  it. Every Elder in this Church who  lives his religion knows that this  which is now transpiring is according  to the mind and forshadowings of the  Holy Spirit, and those out of the  Church may know if they will. If  persons will believe the Bible, the  Book of Doctrines and Covenants,  and the Book of Mormon, they can  therein learn the fate of the world,  for it is there pointed out in great  plainness. Who can stay this war  that is devastating the whole nation  both North and South? No human  hand; it is out of the power of  man, excepting by the repentance  of the whole nation, for they have  shed the blood of the Prophets, driven  this Church and people from their  midst, yes, the very people that hold  the keys of salvation for the world  they have banished from their midst,  they have turned those keys that will  seal their condemnation, and for this  the Lord our God has taken peace  out of their midst. Will there ever  be any more peace among them?  No, not until the earth is drenched  with the blood of the inhabitants  thereof. When the spirit of the  Gospel leaves any people it leaves  them in a worse condition than it  found them, the spirit of ferocity,  darkness and war will take hold  of that people, and the time will  come when every man that does not  take his sword against his neighbor  will have to go to Zion for safety.    These things sound strange in the  ears of our neighbors of the nation  with which we are connected, but let  me tell you they are strictly true.  Remember Christ's words in regard to  the temple, viz., "There shall not  be left here one stone upon another  that shall not be thrown down."—  ##Matthew 24:2|Matthew xxiv., 2.## The Lord Jesus  Christ is as truthful now as he was  then, and no power can stay his hand.  Have we any fears of the conse-  quences of what will transpire? No,  we have not, for we know that God is  at the helm. 
 When this kingdom commenced it  was like a mustard seed, very small,  but the Lord has sustained it and he  will continue to control it to the end  of time. Although peace is being  taken from the earth yet this kingdom  will thrive and prosper until every  kingdom and government shall be  broken to pieces, and every power  shall be subject to the God of heaven.    Here are Elders who are faithful  and true who have preached the  Gospel from Maine to Texas, and  from the Atlantic to California, and  the warning voice has been lifted in  Europe and in the Islands of the Sea,  and thousands have embraced it and  been made to rejoice in the truth.    We know that this work is of God,  and that it will roll forth and prosper  though all the world oppose. War  is only one of the troubles that the  United States are going to receive;  and I can further testify, that there is  no nation that will escape the judg-  ments of the Almighty. There is no  ear but what has to be penetrated  with the sound of the Gospel of  Christ; and by-and-by the Elders of  Israel will be taken from those  nations where they are now preaching,  and there will be another set of Mis-  sionaries sent amongst the people;  there will be the voice of lightning,  the noise of war, and of all those judg-  ments which have been enumerated  and prophesied of since the begin-  ning of time, and they will go forth  among the nations until the land is  cleansed from the abominations that  now reign upon the face of the earth.    When this Gospel was first pro-  claimed to the world, darkness covered  the earth; and wherever this doctrine  is preached by those having authority  and it is rejected, that people become  more dark than they were before,  and go blindly along like the ox  to the slaughter, and they will sooner  or later be overtaken by the judg-  ments of the Almighty.    This is the nature of our testimony,  brethren and sisters, we know that  this work is true; we also know that  Joseph Smith was a Prophet of God,  and the Bible could not have been  fulfilled unless the Lord had raised  up Prophets to declare the everlasting  Gospel unto the children of men; he  never could have brought his judg-  ments upon the nations until he had  raised up those Prophets who were  ordained to come and warn the world.  The Lord is now doing this work of  warning, first by his servants and  then by his judgments. In speaking  of the kingdom of God I will here  remark, that it is always alike, or in  other words it is always governed  by the same laws, by Apostles and  Prophets, and you cannot have a   Church of Christ without these officers;  there never was such a church since  the beginning of the world. If any  person will show me a people that  were acknowledged of God, who did  not have Prophets to lead them, I  will confess that to be something  which I have not found.    Paul says, speaking of the Church  of Christ, "And he gave some  Apostles, and some Prophets, and  some Evangelists, and some Pastors  and Teachers." [##Ephesians 4:11##] Then, in another part  of the writings of the same Apostle,  he shows that with such an organiza-  tion one part cannot say to the other  "I have no need of thee," [##1 Corinthians 12:21##] but that all  are necessary in the Church of Christ.  It is just so with the gifts and graces  of the Gospel. A great many of you  have seen men without some of their  limbs, and just as quick as I come to  a man who has lost an arm I see it.  I remember once seeing a man in  London without any legs, dragging  along as best he could, and of course  it was very inconvenient for him to  travel; but I will tell you one thing  which I never did see, I never saw  any man going around without any  head. A man can live without arms 
 or without legs, but he cannot  without a head, and it is precisely so  with the Church of Christ; one is  just as impossible as the other. No  other order has been manifested in  this our day. We have a Prophet  to lead and govern this people; we  also have pastors and teachers, the  Holy Ghost and the revelations of  Jesus Christ right from heaven unto  us, and we are realizing every day  the fulfilment of these things that are  promised to the faithful.    Brethren and sisters, we ought to  be truly thankful to our Father and  God, for he has been merciful to us,  he has bestowed upon us his Spirit so  that our ears have been opened to  hear and our hearts to understand  and to rejoice in the good things of  the kingdom of God. And how  lamentable it is that so few in the  present generation have embraced  the fulness of the Gospel, perhaps not  one in ten thousand have received the  truth. The Jews have suffered long  and grievously for their rebellion, and  they will continue to suffer for some  time yet, but woe unto the Gentiles  when they reject the light that is  offered, for when that stone, which is  spoken of in Scripture, falls upon   them they cannot escape the crushing   power thereof, it will grind them to  powder.    Let us be faithful, serve our God  and trust in him, and then, through  the influence of his Spirit we shall  know the signs of the times, and be  prepared and made meet for our  Master's use.    I ask that this may be our portion,  in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 
 COMPREHENSIVENESS OF THE LATTER-DAY WORK.  77    REMARKS BY ELDER WILFORD WOODRUFF,  DELIVERED IN THE NEW TABERNACLE, SALT LAKE CITY,  APRIL 8, 1872.    (Reported by David W. Evans.)    COMPREHENSIVENESS OF THE LATTER-DAY WORK.    We have had a very good Confer-  ence; we have heard a great deal of   testimony from the servants of the   Lord, and that testimony has been   true. The building up of the Zion  of God in these latter days includes,   I may say of a truth, every branch   of business, both temporal and   spiritual, in which we are engaged.  We can not touch upon any subject   which is lawful in the sight of God   and man, that is not embraced in our   religion. The Gospel of Jesus Christ   which we have embraced, and which  we preach, includes all truth, and   every lawful calling and occupation   of man. One subject that we are   deeply interested in I wish to say a   few words upon. In the first place  I wish to give notice in this stage of   my remarks to the members of the   Deseret Agricultural and Manufac-  turing Society, that they are re-  quested to meet, at the close of this   meeting, at the Historian's Office, to   appoint their president and board of   directors for the coming season, for   the times demand that we should   hold a State fair in this city this fall.    Strangers may think this a very   strange subject to present in a reli-  gious meeting, but we are building   up the literal kingdom of God on the   earth, and we have temporal duties   to perform. We inhabit temporal   bodies, we eat temporal food, we   build temporal houses, we raise tem-  poral cattle and temporal wheat; we   contend with temporal weeds, and  with temporal enemies in our soil,  and these things naturally give rise   to the necesssity of attending to and   performing many duties of a tempo-  ral and arduous nature, and they,   of course, are embraced in our reli-  gion. In building up the Zion and   kingdom of God in these latter days,  our agricultural and manufacturing   interests are of the most vital im-  portance; in fact manufacturing and   agricultural pursuits are of vital  importance to any nation under hea-  ven. Show me a nation whose people  cultivate the earth, and manufacture   what they need, and I will show you   a rich and independent nation.  Show me a nation that lives entirely   by mining and I will show you a   poor nation—one that is ready to   run out and become obsolete. You   see this manifest in the history of all   nations under heaven. What gives   England her wealth to-day? Her   coal, iron, and the products of her   soil, in connection with her prodigious   manufactures; and it is so with all  the nations of the earth. What   makes the United States what she is   to-day? Her products and the cul-  tivation of her soil, and the constant   efforts she has made to supply the   wants of her people. Not but what 
 78  JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.    mining is all right, there is no fault   with the development of the re-  sources of the earth under favorable   circumstances. When we came here   our position demanded that the very   first thing we did was to plant our   potatoes and sow our wheat, or we   had starvation before us; and I will   here say that the Saints and the El-  ders of Israel have gone before the   Lord day after day and week after   week, and prayed the Almighty to   hide up the treasures of these moun-  tains, lest even the Latter-day Saints,   with all the faith they had, should be   tempted to turn away from the culti-  vation of the earth and the manu-  facture of what they needed; and the   Lord heard our prayers, and we   dwelt here many years and filled   these valleys for six hundred miles  with cities, towns, villages, gardens,  orchards, fields, vineyards, hundreds   of school-houses, and places of wor-  ship, until we made the desert blos-  som as the rose, and had a supply of   wheat, bread and clothing upon our   hands. Then, I do not know but the   Elders ceased praying for the Lord   to hide up the treasures of the earth   —I guess they did, for very soon   after mines began to be opened, and   now silver mines are being worked in   many parts of the Territory. A few  years ago General Connor and others,   who dwelt here, with soldiers under   them, spent very many days in   prospecting these mountains from one   end to the other for gold and silver,  but they could find none; to-day you   may go over the same places, and if   you dig into the earth you may find   plenty of silver, and you may find it   almost anywhere in these mountains.  I suppose this is all right, I have no   fault to find with it; but I still say   that the interest of the Latter-day   Saints in these mountains is to culti-  vate the soil and to manufacture what   [t]hey use.    Through the influence of President   Young we have many manufactories   for wool and cotton already estab-  lished in this Territory.  He has   done more than any man living in   these last days, according to the   means he has had at his command,   to establish these branches of busi-  ness in the midst of these mountains.  We have now many large factories in   this Territory that have to stand still  for want of wool. I want to say a   few words on this subject to the wool   growers of Deseret.  Instead of   sending our wool out of the Territory,   to eastern States to be manufactured   into cloth, and purchasing it and   paying eastern manufacturers a large   per centage for it when brought here   by railroad, I feel that it is our duty,   and it would be far wiser for us, to   sell our wool to those who own fac-  tories in this Territory, and to sustain   ourselves by sustaining home manu-  factures.    One of the first commands given   to Adam, after being placed in Eden,  was to dress the garden; and he was   permitted to eat of the fruit of every   tree except one.  After a while Adam  and his wife, Eve, partook of the   fruit of this tree, and the history of   the Fall is before us and the world.  After Adam was cast out of the gar-  den the Lord told him that there   should be a curse on the earth, and   instead of bringing forth beautiful   flowers, fruit and grain spontaneously,   as before the Fall, it should bring   forth thorns, briers, thistles and   noxious weeds, and that man should  earn his bread by the sweat of his   brow; and from that time to the   present mankind has had this curse  to contend with in the cultivation of   the earth. In consequence of this   the inhabitants of Utah, in their  agricultural operations have to fight   against the cockle burr, the black   seed and sunflower, as well as thorns 
 COMPREHENSIVENESS OF THE LATTER-DAY WORK.  79    and thistles and many other noxious   weeds, which, if not eradicated,   speedily take advantage of us, and   to a great extent, mar the result of   our labors. It will pay us to pay   attention to these things; it will pay   us to dress the earth, to till it, to   take care of and spend time and   means in manuring and feeding it;   it will pay us to gather out these   noxious weeds, for the earth will then   have a chance to bring forth in its   strength. This, with the blessing of   God upon our labors, has made the   soil of Utah as productive as it is   to-day.  I wish to see this interest   increase in our midst; and I hope, in   addition to this, that those who are   raising sheep—our wool growers—   will pay attention to and carry on   that branch of business systemati-  cally, and that we will sell our wool   to those who manufacture it at home,   instead of sending it out of the   Territory to be manufactured. I feel   that this is our duty, and the course   which will promote our best interests,  and it is a principle which is true,   independent of religion, in any com-  munity or nation; it is a self-sus-  taining principle.    God has blessed us, he has blessed   the earth, and our labors in the tilling   of the soil have been greatly pros-  pered. As has been said by some of   our brethren in their remarks, when   the pioneers came here, no mark of   civilization or of the white man, was  found. If those who are now so   anxious to obtain the homes we have   made, had seen Utah as we saw it,  they would never have desired a   habitation here, but they would have   got out of it as soon as they could.  It was barren, desolate, abounding   with grasshoppers, crickets and kiote  wolves, and these things seemed to   be the only natural production of  the soil. We went to work by faith,  not much by sight, to cultivate the   earth. We broke almost all the   plows we had the first day. We had   to let streams of water out to moisten  the earth, and by experience we had   to learn to raise anything. The   stranger comes into Salt Lake City  and sees our orchards, and the trees  in our streets, and he thinks, what a   fruitful and delightful place it is.  He does not think that, for twenty   or twenty-four years, almost every   tree he beholds, according to its age,  has had to be watered twice a week  through the whole summer season, or   they would all have been dead long   since. We have had to unite upon   these things, the Lord has blessed   our labors, and his mercies have been   over this people.    If we had not cultivated the earth,   but had turned our attention to min-  ing, we should not only have starved  to death ourselves, but thousands of   strangers, who have passed through,   would have shared the same fate.  Utah Territory has been the great   highway to California, Nevada, and   all the western States and Territories,  and they have all looked, in a mea-  sure, to Utah for their bread. No-  body but Latter-day Saints would   have lived here, and endured the   trials and affllictions that we endured   in the beginning; none others would   have stayed and fought the crickets   one year, as we had to do year after   year. Any people but the Latter-  day Saints would have left this coun-  try long ago. Not only so, on   account of the things I have already   named, but I will here say that no   other people could have lived here—  no, they would have knocked each   others' brains out on account of the   little water they would have had in   their irrigating operations. When  men saw their crops and trees wither-  ing and perishing for the want of   water, the selfishness so general in   the world would have worked up to 
 80  JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.    such an extent, that they would have   killed one another, and hence I say   that none but Latter-day Saints   would have stood it; but they, by   the training and experience they   had before received, were prepared   for the hardships and trials they had   to encounter in this country.    Brethren and sisters, let us con-  tinue our efforts in cultivating the   earth, and in the manufacturing what   we want. And I still urge upon   our Female Relief Societies, in this   city and throughout the Territory, to   carry out the counsel President  Young gave us years and years ago,   and try, as far as possible, within   ourselves, to make our own bonnets,   hats and clothing, and to let the   beauty of what we wear be the work-  manship of our own hands. It is   true that our religion is not in our   coat or bonnet, or it should not be.  If a man's religion is there it is   not generally very deep anywhere   else. But God has blessed us with   the products of earth and the bles-  sings of heaven, and his Spirit has   been with us; we have been pre-  served, and the Lord has turned   away the edge of the sword, and   he has protected us during many   years past and gone, and we all   have to acknowledge his hand in   these things.    I do not wish to detain this Con-  ference. I felt as though I wanted   to make a few remarks on these sub-  jects. I hope, brethren, that we   will not slacken our hands with   regard to the cultivation of the   earth. In the prosecution of our   labors in that respect we have every-  thing to contend with that man has   been cursed with for five thousand   years. We should clean our fields,   as far as we can, of the noxious   weeds, and our streets of sunflowers.  These things encumber the earth.    We have one difficulty to contend   with, unknown save in those por-  tions of the earth where irrigation   is practiced.  It is true that a man   may clean his fields of sunflowers,  cockle burrs, blackseed and every   other noxious weed that grows, and   the very first time he waters his land   here will come a peck or a bushel of   foul seed from the mountains, and   fill every field through which the   stream flows. These difficulties we   have to fight against, but we must   do the best we can. As farmers,   we should clean our seed, and not   sow the foul along with the good.  One man, in a few hours, with a   good wire sieve, can sift enough seed   for ten acres of land, and perhaps   for twenty; while, to pull that bad   seed out when grown will cost from   one to five hundred dollars, for it   will take a score of men days to do   it. We should use our time, judg-  ment and the wisdom God has   given us to the best advantage in   all these things.    I want the brethren to come toge-  ther this afternoon and elect their   officers, for we desire to hold a fair   this fall, in which the agricultural  and manufacturing interests of the   Territory may be represented aud   interested. Let us not be weary in   well doing; let us not slacken our   hands, either in cultivating the earth   or in the manufacturing of what we   need. Co-operate in agricultural   and mercantile matters, also in our   tanneries, and in the making of   butter and cheese. One man may   engage in these branches of busi-  ness with advantage if he have skill  and experience to guide him; but in   co-operation the wisdom of all is   combined for the general good. This  plan has been adopted with advantage  in other communities, cities, States,  Territories and countries, and it can   be in this more extensively than it   has been hitherto. 
 OBSERVE THE SABBATH DAY.  81    I pray that God will bless us, and   bless this whole people; and I pray   that the testimony which we have   received here during this Conference,   which is true, may not be forgotten   by us.  I can bear the same testi-  mony.  I know this work is of God.  I know Joseph Smith was a Prophet   of God.  I have heard two or three   of the brethren testify about brother   Young in Nauvoo. Every man and   every woman in that assembly, which   perhaps might number thousands,   could bear the same testimony. I   was there, the twelve were there,  and a good many others, and all can   bear the same testimony. The ques-  tion might be asked, why was the   appearance of Joseph Smith given to   Brigham Young? Because here was   Sidney Rigdon and other men rising   up and claiming to be the leaders of   the Church, and men stood, as it   were, on a pivot, not knowing which   way to turn. But just as quick as   Brigham Young rose in that assem-  bly, his face was that of Joseph   Smith—the mantle of Joseph had   fallen upon him, the power of God   that was upon Joseph Smith was   upon him, he had the voice of Joseph,  and it was the voice of the shepherd.  There was not a person in that as-  sembly, Rigdon, himself, not ex-  cepted, but was satisfied in his own   mind that Brigham was the proper   leader of the people, for he would  not have his name presented, by his   own consent, after that sermon was   delivered. There was a reason for   this in the mind of God; it con-  vinced the people. They saw and   heard for themselves, and it was by   the power of God.    May God bless you.  May he give   us wisdom to direct us in all things,  and promote all the interests of Zion   for Jesus' sake.  Amen. 
 THE SIGNS OF THE COMING OF THE SON OF MAN, ETC.   275    DISCOURSE BY ELDER WILFORD WOODRUFF,  DELIVERED IN THE 13TH WARD ASSEMBLY ROOMS, SALT LAKE CITY,  JANUARY 12, 1873.    (Reported by David W. Evans.)    THE SIGNS OF THE COMING OF THE SON OF MAN -- THE SAINTS' DUTIES.    My address this afternoon will be   intended for those who profess to be   Latter-day Saints -- those who have   entered into co[v]enant with the Lord   our God.  I am surrounded with   those who know by experience that   we are dependent upon the influence   and inspiration of the Holy Ghost to   enable us to teach the things of the   kingdom of God.  My faith is that   no man, in this or any other genera-  tion, is able to teach and edify the   inhabitants of the earth without the   inspiration of the Spirit of God.  As   a people we have been placed in   positions the last forty years which   have taught, in all our administra-  tions and labors, the necessity of   acknowledging the hand of God in   all things.  We feel this necessity   to-day.  I know that I am not quali-  fied to teach either the Latter-day   Saints or the world without the   Spirit of God.  I desire this this   afternoon, and also your faith and   prayers, that my mind may be led in   a channel which may be beneficial to   you.  In my public teaching I never   permit my mind to follow in any   channel except that which the Spirit   dictates to me, and this is the posi-  tion we all occupy when we meet   with the Saints, or when we go forth   to preach the Gospel.  As Jesus told   his Apostles, Take no thought what   ye shall say, it is told us, Take no  thought what we shall say ; but we   treasure up in our minds words of   wisdom by the blessing of God and   studying the best books.    We are told in the 24th chapter   of Matthew that Jesus, on a certain   occasion, taught his disciples many   things concerning his Gospel, the   Temple, the Jews, his second com-  ing and the end of the world ; and   they asked him -- Master, what shall   be the sign of these things?  The   Savior answered them, but in a very   brief manner.  As my mind runs a   little in that channel, I feel disposed   to read a portion of the word of the   Lord unto us, which explains this   matter more fully than the Savior   explained it to his disciples.  That   portion of the word of the Lord   which I shall read, is a revelation   given to the Latter-day Saints,  March 7, 1831, forty-two years ago   next March.  It commences on the   133rd page of the Book of Doctrine   and Covenants.    -[The speaker read the revelation,   and then resumed his remarks as   follows]- :    I want to ask who are looking for   the fulfillment of these events, and   who upon the earth are preparing   themselves for the fulfillment of the   word of the Lord through the months   of Prophets, Patriarchs and Apostles  for the last six thousand years? 
 276   JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.    Nobody that I have any knowledge   of, without it is the Latter-day Saints,   and I for one feel that we are not   half so much awake as we ought to   be, and not half as well prepared as   we ought to be for the tremendous   events which are coming upon the   earth in quick succession in these   latter days.  Who can the Lord ex-  pect to prepare for his second coming   but his Saints?  None.  Why?  Because, as is said in this revelation,   light has come forth to the inhabitants   of the earth, and they have rejected   it, because their deeds are evil.  This  message has been proclaimed among   the Christian nations of Europe and   America, and in many other nations,  for the past forty years.  Inspired   men -- the Elders of Israel -- have   gone forth without purse or scrip   declaring the Gospel of life and sal-  vation to the nations of the world,  but they have rejected their testi-  mony, and condemnation rests upon   them therefor."  As the Prophet   said, "Darkness covers the earth,  and gross darkness the minds of the   people."  Who believes in the fulfill-  ment of prophecy and revelation?  Who, among priests and people to-  day, has any faith in the sayings of   Jesus Christ?  If there be any peo-  ple besides the Saints whose eyes are   open to the great events which will   soon overtake the nations, I would  like to know and visit them.  I   would to God that the eyes of the   Latter-day Saints were open far more   than they are to those things that   rest upon them!  The Lord is look-  ing to them alone to build up his  Zion here in the mountains of Israel,  and to prepare the bride, the Lamb's   wife, for the coming of the Great   Bridegroom.  I believe in the ful-  fillment of the revelations which the   Lord has given to us, as much as I   believe that I have a soul to save or   lose, or as much as I believe in the   shining of the sun in the firmament   of heaven.  Why?  Because every   word that God has ever spoken, whe-  ther by his own voice out of the hea-  vens, by the ministration of angels,   or by the mouths of inspired men,  has been fulfilled to the very letter as   far as time has permitted.  We have   fulfilled many of the sayings of the   Prophets of God.  The revelation I   have read this afternoon was given   forty-two years ago.  Has there been   any sound of war since then?  Has   there been any sound of war in our   land since that period?  Has there   been any standard lifted up to the   nations, any gathering together of   the people into these mountains of   Israel from nearly all nations?  There   has [.] We have had a beginning, the   fig tree is leaving, putting forth its   leaves in the sight of all men, and   the signs in both heaven and earth   all indicate the coming of the Lord   Jesus Christ.    When my mind, under the influ-  ence of the Spirit of God, is open to   comprehend these things, I many  times marvel and wonder, not only   at the world but also at ourselves,  that we are not more anxious and   diligent in preparing ourselves and   our families for the events now at   our doors, for though the heavens   and the earth pass away, not one   jot or tittle of the word of the Lord   will go unfulfilled.  There is no pro-  phecy of Scripture that is of any   private interpretation, but holy men   of God spake as they were moved   upon by the Holy Ghost, and their   words will be fulfilled on the earth.    We are approaching an important   time.  As Jesus once said, The   world hate me, and without a cause,  therefore I have chosen you out of   the world, and the world hate you   also.  The servant is not above his   master, you are not above me, they   have hated me and they will hate 
 THE SIGNS OF THE COMING OF THE SON OF MAN, ETC.  277    you.  The Lord has chosen the Lat-  ter-day Saints, and through them   has sent a message to all nations   under heaven.  The Zion of God is   opposed by priest and people in every   sect, party and denomination in   Christendom.  The Elders of Israel   have been called from the plow,   plane, hammer and the various oc-   cupations of life, to go forth and   bear record of these things to the   world.  We have followed this up   until the present time for more than   forty-two years -- forty-three years   next April.  The kingdom has stead-  ily grown, and while we have la-  bored we have seen the fulfillment   of the word of the Lord.  The sea   has gone beyond its bounds, there   have been earthquakes in divers   places, and there have also been   wars and rumors of wars.  These are   only a beginning, their fullness has   not yet opened upon the sons of   men, but it is at their doors; it is at   the doors of this generation and   of this nation.  And when the   world rise up against the kingdom   of God in these latter days, should  the Saints have any fears?  Should  we fear because men, in their secret   chambers, concoct plans to over-  throw the kingdom of God?  We   should not.  There is one thing we   should do, and that is, pray to God.  Every righteous man has done this,   even Jesus the Savior, the Only Be-  gotten of the Father in the flesh,  had to pray, from the manger to   the cross, all the way through; every   day he had to call upon his Father   to give him grace to sustain him   in his hour of affliction and to enable   him to drink the bitter cup.  So with   his disciples.  They were baptized   with the same baptism that he was   baptized with; they suffered the   same death that he died, being cru-  cified as he was.  They sealed their   testimony with their blood.  Never-  theless all that Jesus said concerning   the Jews has had its fulfillment to   the present day.  This should be a   strong testimony to the whole infidel   world of the truth of Christ's mission   and divinity.  Let them look at the   Jewish nation and the state of the   world, in fulfillment of the words of   the Savior eighteen hundred years   ago in Jerusalem.  It is one of the   strongest testimonies in the world of   the fulfillment of revelation, the truth   of the Bible and the mission of Jesus   Christ.  The Jews have fulfilled the   words of Moses, the prophets and   Jesus, up to the present day.  They  have been dispersed and trampled   under the feet of the Gentile world   now for eighteen hundred years.  When Pontius Pilate wished to re-  lease Jesus Christ, saying that he   found no fault in that just man, the   high priests, scribes, pharisees and   other Jews present on that occasion   cried, "Crucify him, and let his blood   be upon us and upon our children." [##Matthew 27:22-25##]  Has it not followed them to this   day, and been manifest in their dis-  persion, persecution and oppression  through the whole Gentile world   for eighteen hundred years?  It has.  And they have to fulfill the words   of the Lord still further.  As I have   been reading to you to-day, the   Jews have got to gather to their   own land in unbelief.  They will   go and rebuild Jerusalem and their   temple.  They will take their gold  and silver from the nations and will   gather to the Holy Land, and when   they have done this and rebuilt their   city, the Gentiles, in fulfillment of   the words of Ezekiel, Jeremiah and   other prophets, will go up against   Jerusalem to battle and to take a   spoil and a prey; and then, when   they have taken one-half of Jeru-  salem captive and distressed the   Jews for the last time on the earth,   their Great Deliverer, Shiloh, will

They do not believe in Jesus   of Nazareth now, nor ever will until   he comes and sets his foot on   Mount Olivet and it cleaves in twain,   one part going towards the east, and   the other towards the west.  Then,  when they behold the wounds in his   hands and in his feet, they will say,  "Where did you get them?"  And   he will reply, "I am Jesus of Naza-  reth, King of the Jews, your Shiloh,  him whom you crucified."  Then, for   the first time will the eyes of Judah   be opened.  They will remain in un-  belief until that day.  This is one of   the events that will transpire in the   latter day.    The Gospel of Christ has to go to   the Gentiles until the Lord says   "enough," until their times are ful-  filled, and it will be in this generation.   Forty years have passed since the   revelation I have read was given to   the sons of men.  We are living in   a late age, although it is true there   are a great many vast and important   events to transpire in these days.  But one thing is certain, though the   Lord has not revealed the day nor   the hour wherein the Son of Man   shall come, he has pointed out the   generation, and the signs predicted as  the fore-runners of that great event   have begun to appear in the heavens   and on the earth, and they will   continue until all is consummated.   If we, as Latter-day Saints, want   anything to stir us up, let us read   the Bible, Book of Mormon and the   Book of Doctrine and Covenants,   they contain enough to edify and  instruct us in the things of God.  Treasure up the revelations of God   and the Gospel of Christ contained  therein.    As an individual, I will say that   I feel a great responsibility resting   upon me, and it also rests upon you.  Joseph Smith and Brigham Young   alone have not been called to build   up in the latter day that great and   mighty kingdom of God which Dan-  iel foretold, and which he said   should be thrown down no more   for ever.  I say, they were not called   to be the only ones to labor in   building up that great and glorious   Zion, which was to become terrible   to all nations; nor their counselors,  nor the Twelve Apostles; but this   responsibility rests upon every one   of the Lord's anointed upon the face   of the earth, I do not care who they   are, whether male or female, and   the Lord will require this at the   hands of all the Latter-day Saints.  I therefore desire that we may be   awake to these subjects, and to the   position we occupy before God and in   the world.    The inhabitants of the earth may   hate and oppose us, as they did   Jesus Christ, and as they have all   inspired men, as they did Noah,  Enoch, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob,  Isaiah, Jeremiah, and all the pro-  phets who ever lived.  They have   always been a thorn in the flesh to   the world.  Why?  Because they   had enough independence of mind   to rebuke sin, to maintain the   promises of God unto man, and to   proclaim the declarations of the Al-  mighty unto the inhabitants of the   earth, fearless of consequences.  The   last song sung here was, "Do what   is right, let the consequence fol-  low."  That is what I say to the   Latter-day Saints.  Let us do what   is right, maintain our religion be-  fore God, be valiant in the testimony   of Jesus Christ, and prepare our-  selves for his coming, for it is near,  and this is what God requires at our   hands.  He leans upon no other   people; he expects from no people   but those who have obeyed his Gos-  pel and gathered here, the accom-  plishment of his great work, the   building up of his latter-day Zion 
 THE SIGNS OF THE COMING OF THE SON OF MAN, ETC.  279    and kingdom.  And, as I have said,   this responsiblity rests not only upon   Prophets and Apostles, but upon   every man and woman who has en-  tered into covenant with him.  I   say that we are too near asleep, we   are not half awake to the position   that we occupy before God, and the   responsibilities we are under to him.  We should be on the watch tower.    Who is going to be prepared for   the coming of the Messiah?  These   men who enjoy the Holy Ghost and   live under the inspiration of the Al-  mighty, who abide in Jesus Christ   and bring forth fruit to the honor   and glory of God.  No other people   will be.  There never was a more   infidel generation of Christians on   the face of the earth than there is   to-day.  They do not expect that   God will do anything in a temporal   point of view towards the fulfill-  ment of his promises; they are not   looking forward for the establish-  ment of his kingdom, or for the   building up of his Zion on the earth.    Their eyes are closed to these  things, because they have rejected   the light.  When Joseph Smith   brought this Gospel to the world,  there was a great deal more faith in   God, a great deal more faith in his   revelations, and, according to the   light they had, a great deal more   pure and undefiled religion than   there is now.  We have carried the   Gospel to all Christian nations who  would permit us, and they have   rejected it, and they are under con-  demnation.  Our own nation is un-  der condemnation on this account.  This land, North and South America,   is the land of Zion, it is a choice   land--the land that was given by   promise from old father Jacob to his   grandson and his descendants, the   land on which the Zion of God   should be established in the latter   days.  We have been fulfilling the   prophecies concerning it, for the   last forty years.  We have come up  here and established the kingdom;  True, it is small to-day, it may be   compared to a mustard seed, but as   the Lord our God lives, the little   one will become a thousand, and   the small one a strong nation, and   the Lord Almighty will hasten it   in his own time, and the world will   learn one thing in this generation,   and that is, that when they fight   against Mount Zion, they fight against   the decrees of the Almighty and the  principles of eternal life.    I rejoice before God that I have   lived to hear the principles of eter-  nal life proclaimed to the sons of   men; I rejoice that I have lived to   see this people gathered together, I   rejoice in coming to the land of   Zion with the Saints of God.  When   we came here twenty-four years ago,  we were a little handful of men,   pioneers; we came to a parched and   barren desert.  Since then we have   built up six hundred miles of cities,   towns, villages, gardens, farms and   orchards; and while doing this we   have had to contend with the opposi-  tion of both priest and people.  Have   they prevailed?  They have not, and   they will not.  Why?  Because he   who sits in the heavens, the Lord our  God, has decreed certain things and   they will come to pass; because the   Lord is watching over the interests   of this people.  He requires us to   work with him, he is at work for us.  It is our duty to build these temples   here--this in Salt Lake City, another   in St. George, in Logan or wherever   they may be needed for the benefit of   the Saints of God in the latter days.  I think many times that many of   us will get to heaven before we shall   want to go there[.] If we were to go   there to-day, many would meet   their friends in the spirit-world and   it would be a reproach to them, for 
 280  JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.    you, Latter-day Saints, in one sense   of the word, hold in your hands the   salvation of your dead, for we can   do much for them.  But I think   many times that our hearts are too   much set on the vain things of the   world to attend to many important   duties devolving upon us connected   with the Gospel.  We are too much   after gold and silver, and we give  our hearts and attention to temporal  matters at the expense of the light   and truth of the Gospel of Jesus   Christ.    We have not much time to spare   as a people, for a grea[t] work is re-  quired at our hands.  I know that,   without the power of God, we should   not have been able to do what has   been done; and I also know that we   never should be able to build up the   Zion of God in power, beauty and   glory were it not that our prayers   ascends into the ears of the Lord God   of Sabaoth, and he hears and answers   them.  The world has sought our   overthrow from the beginning, and   the devil does not like us very well.  Lucifer, the Son of the Morning,  does not like the idea of revelation to   the Saints of God, and he has in-  spired the hearts of a great many   men, since the Gospel was restored to   the earth, to make war against us.  But not one of them has made any-  thing out of it yet--neither glory,  immortality, eternal life nor money.  No man or people ever did make any-  thing by fighting against God in the   past, and no man or people will ever   make anything by taking that course   in the future.    This is the work and kingdom of   God; this is the Zion of God and the   Church of Christ, and we are called  by his name.  The Latter-day Saints  have to abide in Christ, and we can   not do that unless we bring forth   fruit, any more than the branch of the   vine can unless it abide in the vine.  To abide in Christ we must enjoy the   Spirit of God, that our minds may be   enlightened to comprehend the things   of God.  When I look at the history   of the Church of God in these latter-  days I many times marvel at what  has been done and how we have   progressed, considering the traditions,   unbelief, failings, follies and nonsense   that man is heir to in the flesh.  We   have had a great many traditions to   overcome and the opposition of the   world to contend with from the   beginning until to-day.  Brethren and   sisters, we should be faithful.  The   Lord has put into our hands the power   to build up his Zion and kingdom on   the earth, and we have more to encou-  rage us than was ever possessed by   any generation that has preceded   us.  We have the privilege of build-  ing up a kingdom that will stand for   ever.  Noah and the Antediluvian   world did not have this privilege.  Enoch built up the Zion of God a   little while, and the Lord took it   away.  Jesus and the Apostles came  here. Jesus fulfilled his mission,  preached the Gospel, was rejected by   the Jews, and was crucified.  His   disciples had a similar fate, and the   Gospel was taken to the Gentile  nation, with all its gifts and blessings  and power, and Paul the Apostle of   the Gentiles warned them to take   heed lest they, in turn, should lose it   through their unbelief.    You know how it has been with   them--that there has been a falling   away, and that for seventeen hun-  dred years the voice of a Prophet or   Apostle has not been heard in the   world; and now again, in these lat-  ter days, the Lord Almighty, re-  membering his promises made from   generation to generation, has sent   Angels from heaven to restore to   man the Gospel and has given au-  thority to administer the same.  The Revelator John, says he saw 
 THE SIGNS OF THE COMING OF THE SON OF MAN, ETC.  281    an angel flying through the   midst of heaven, having the ever-  lasting Gospel to preach to them   that dwell on the earth, to every   nation, kindred, tongue and people,  saying with a loud voice, "Fear  God and give glory to him who   made the heavens, the earth, the   seas and the fountains of water, for the   hour of God's judgment has come."    Oh! ye Gentile nations, wake up   and prepare yourselves for that   which is to come, for as God lives   his judgments are at your door.  They are at the door of our nation,   and the thrones and kingdoms of   the whole world will fall, and all  the efforts of men combined cannot   save them.  It is a day of warning,  but not of many words, to the na-  tions.  The Lord is going to make a   short work, or no flesh could be   saved.  If it were not for the mani-  festation of the power of God what   would be the fate of his Zion and   people?  The same as in the days of   Christ and his Apostles.  The Lord   has had Zion before his face from  before the foundation of the world,  and he is going to build it up.   "Who am I," saith the Lord, "that   I promise and do not fulfill?"  The   Lord never made a promise to the   sons of men which he has not ful-  filled, therefore Latter-day Saints,   you have all the encouragement in  the world to sustain you in the faith   that the Zion of God will remain on  the earth.  The work is in our  hands to perform, the God of hea-  ven requires it of us and if we fail   to build it up we shall be under con-  demnation, and the Lord would   remove us out of the way and he   would raise up another people who  would do it.  Why?  Because the   Almighty has decreed that this work   shall be performed on the earth, and   no power on earth or in hell can hin-  der it.    I would here say to our delegate   to Congress, when you go to Wash-  ington, have no fears with regard to   the opposition of men.  You have   every reason to go in confidence,   and do your duty, knowing that   the Lord will stand by you, and so   has every man in the Church and   kingdom of God, I care not where   we are placed or what God requires   at our hands.  He is at the helm,   and he has protected us until to-  day.  Where should we have been a   few years ago when the army was   sent to destroy us, if it had not been   for the protection of the Almighty?  We should not have been here.  And so it will be in days to come.  The world hate us because the Al-  mighty has called us out from the   world to proclaim his Gospel and   build up his kingdom.  Let us be   faithful, for the Lord is going to   protect us, and build up Zion.  He   will also gather Israel, rebuild Je-  rusalem and prepare the way for his   second coming, in the clouds of   heaven.  Then let us, Latter-day   Saints, wake up to our duty.  Think  nothing too hard that the Lord re-  quires of us.  Let us build this   Temple that we may attend to the   ordinances for the living and the   dead.  If we not do this we shall be   sorry.  When I see men who have   received the word of God, and tasted   the powers of the world to come, and   then turn away, I think of the par-  able of the five wise and five foolish   virgins.  It will pay us to be wise   and to have oil in our lamps, to have   fellowship with the Holy Spirit, and   to live our religion and keep the   commandments of God day by day.  Brethren are passing away.  I have   been away three or four weeks on a   visit to the people in the upper settle-  ments, and since my return I hear of   this man and that man dead, whom I   saw well and hale before I went away. 
 282  JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.    So it will be with us in a little while.  We shall pass away and go to the   other side of the vail, and the burden   of the building up of Zion will rest   upon our sons and daughters.  Then   rejoice in the Gospel of Christ.  Re-  joice in the principles of eternal life.  I am looking for the fulfillment of all  things that the Lord has spoken, and   they will come to pass as the Lord   God lives.  Zion is bound to rise and   flourish.  The Lamanites will blos-  som as the rose on the mountains.  I   am willing to say here that, though I   believe this, when I see the power of   the nation destroying them from the   face of the earth, the fulfillment of   that prophecy is perhaps harder for   me to believe than any revelation of   God that I ever read.  It looks as   though there would not be enough   left to receive the Gospel; but not-  withstanding this dark picture, every   word that God has ever said of them   will have its fulfillment, and they, by   and by, will receive the Gospel.  It   will be a day of God's power among   them, and a nation will be born in a   day.  Their chiefs will be filled with   the power of God and receive the   Gospel, and they will go forth and  build the new Jerusalem, and we shall  help them.  They are branches of   the house of Israel, and when the   fullness of the Gentiles has come in   and the work ceases among them, then   it will go in power to the seed of   Abraham.    Brethren and sisters, let us remem-  ber our position before the Lord!  Let   us try and keep the faith, let us labor   for the Holy Spirit, that our hearts,  minds and eyes may be opened, that   we may live by inspiration, that when   we see dark clouds rising and evils  strewing our path, we may be able to   overcome [.] The Savior was tempted,  so were his Apostles, and if we have   not been we shall be.  As the Lord   told Joseph Smith, "I will try and   prove you in all things, even unto   death.  If you are not willing to abide   my covenants unto death, you are   not worthy of me."  Did Joseph   abide unto death?  I think he did,  and he with Abraham, Isaac and   Jacob, will sit at the right hand of   the Lord Jesus Christ, and will re-  ceive his glory and crown.  He was   true and faithful unto death, and his   testimony is in force to-day, in lan-  guage as loud as ten tho[u]sand thun-  ders.  Whether it is believed or re-  jected it will have its fulfillment on   the heads of this generation.    By and by great Babylon will fall   and there will be wailing, mourning   and sore affliction in her midst.  The   sons of Zion have got to stand in holy   places to be preserved in the midst of   the judgments that will shortly over-  take the world.  We can see how fully   the revelation, calling us to go to   the western countries, has been ful-  filled.  In less than forty years, a   standard has been lifted up, and peo-  ple gathered here from France, Eng-  land, Scotland, Wales, Denmark,   Norway, Sweden, and almost all the   nations of the earth in fulfillment of   that revelation.  When it was given   no man among us knew anything   about Salt Lake or the Rocky Moun-  tains; but it has been fulfilled before   our eyes.  We have come up here,   and in so doing have fulfilled the re-  velations of God, so far.  Let us   continue, I pray God my heavenly   Father that he will bless the Latter-  day Saints; that he will give us his   Holy Spirit and wisdom, that our   eyes may be opened, that we may   have faith in the things of God.  Let   a man lose the Holy Spirit and what   faith has he?  None, either in God   or in his revelations, and that is what   is the matter to-day.  You may take   the best friends we have outside of   of this kingdom, and you can hardly   get them to believe that God has any- 
 THE SIGNS OF THE COMING OF THE SON OF MAN.  283    thing to do with the affairs of men,   or that he has power to do anything   for them, either as individuals or na-  tions.  If their eyes were open one   moment they would understand that   God holds them all in the hollow of   his hand, weighs them in the balance   and that they cannot make a move   without his permission.  They would   no longer wonder why the Latter-day   Saints have faith in God if their eyes   were open so that they could under-  stand the work and things of God.  They can not understand it, they   cannot even see the kingdom of God   unless they are born of the Spirit of   God, and they cannot enter into it   unless they are born of the water and   the Spirit, according to the words of   Jesus to Nicodemus.    I have a desire that we may be   faithful in our mission and ministry,  as Elders of Israel and as Saints of   God, that we may do our duty, and   maintain our position before the Lord.  Let our prayers go up before him.  If   I have any forte it is prayer to God.  We are not called to build up Zion   by preaching, singing and praying   alone; we have to perform hard   labor, labor of bone and sinew, in   building towns, cities, villages; and   we have to continue to do this; but   while we are so engaged, we should   not sin.  We have no right to sin,   whether we are in the kanyon draw-  ing wood, or performing any other   hard labor, and we should have the   Spirit of God to direct us then as   much as when preaching, praying,   singing and attending to the ordinan-  ces of the house of God.  If we do   this as a people we shall grow in the   favor and power of God.  We should   be united together, it is our duty to   be so.  Our prayers should ascend   before God, and I know they do.  I   know that President Young is prayed   for--I know that his counselors and   the Twelve are prayed for, and that   the Church and kingdom of God is   prayed for.  We should continue this,   and if we pray in faith we shall have   what we ask for.  The Lord has   taught us to pray, and I rejoice that   I have learned to pray according to   the order of God, for in this we have   a promise--that where two or three   agree in asking for any thing that is   just and right, it shall be granted   unto them.    May God bless you!  May he give   us wisdom, and his Holy Spirit to   guide us, that we may be enabled to   be true and faithful to our covenants,  and be prepared to inherit eternal   life, for Jesus' sake.  Amen. 
 Elder Wilford Woodruff. No man can preach   the Gospel of Jesus Christ without the spirit and power   thereof no matter what his, qualities are; and there   never has been a time when this spirit is more needed   than now. Related incidents that occured during   his missions in the world. when the power of evil  spirits was made manifest, Especially on the in-  troduction of the Gospel in England. Apostacy   is the result of these evil influences. Refered to   the great apostacy in Kirtland. Said, God will take   care of His Church, of the leaders, all who hold   the Priesthood; and we must sustain them, or   we will go to destruction as many have. Had   not Joseph and those associated with him accepted   the revelation on Celestial marriage, this gospel   would have been taken from the Earth. And I beleive 
 1875    the same same is true of the United Order. We  can see the hand of the Lord in the movement   concerning genealogy in the Eastern States. This   is the result of the revelation concerning Bap-  tism for the dead. We are now enabled to   trace our genealogy to all our progenitors behind   the vail. The prophet of each dispensation Seals   his testimony with his blood. Related his ex-  perience at the time the prophet Joseph   was killed. The Church has passed into a   new dispensation, and our leader will not be   assasssinated, all who oppose Israil will   go down—judges, Govenor, Presidents &c. The   Mothers of Isral have the training of their chil-  dren, as the Elders are from home; hence they   have great responsibility 
 Elder W. Woodruff, illustrated the difference  between the Prophet Joseph and the Rev. Drs. of the   day. We are asked why the Lord chose one in ign-  orance to reveal His Gospel. It was to have one who ^would^  heed His word. Alluded to the mighty occurrencis  cotemporaneous with the Gospel. Especially the histor-  ical & genealogical Society of New England. If  the Prophet Joseph had refused the revelation on  Celestial Marriage the Church would have stopped  there. In all ages of the world, God has had those  Spirits who were called before the foundation of the   world through whom to reveal His will. This is the  case to-day with the United Order of which we seem  to be afraid. As if God would reveal any thing for  our harm. Uttered condemnation for many  of the follies & extravagances of fashion. God, the  Holy Prophets and all the hosts of Heaven are  looking to us to for help. Let us do it. 
 Elder W. Woodruff spoke of the privilege   of bearing a testimony. He said, the Gospel of   Jesus Christ is just as true to-day as it ever was ^yet^,   but very few people are independent enough to   serve the Lord. This is God's work, and there are   but few who can be used as the Lord desires, they   would want their own way, hence the Lord chooses   the obedient, and not partial thereby. Even the   Apostles of the Savior were men of low degree.   The Lord will prevail and nothing can stay His   hand. We are to be a tried people, as we heard   this morning. Yet the faithful will be saved as has   been revealed, for every revelation will be fulfill-  ed. Elders have compassed the world, and always   been sustained. We will be held accountable for 
 1876    all things we receive, for the Lord has all things. No   generation before has ever had so much to perform as we   have. Spoke of the organization of the church by the Prophet   Joseph—of its completeness and power, all of which   is the result of God's providences manifested in our be-  half; for it is His work, yet we must do our part.   The year the baptism of the dead was revealed, a society   was organized, to obtain the genealogy and history   of the society as well as others. Spoke at length   on this subject, urging the Saints to prosecute the work   on the Temple; that the living and the dead may be   cared for. I desire now to labor only with the Saints   and for the dead. He said, there are millions to be   cared for. 
 SYNOPSIS OF A   DISCOURSE BY ELDER WILFORD WOODRUFF,    DELIVERED IN THE PROVO MEETING HOUSE, OCT. 13, 1877.    (From the Territorial Enquirer.)    THE WORK PROGRESSING-PROPHECY FULFILLED-WE SHALL ALL OBEY   THE LAW OF DEATH.    It was with pleasure I listened   this morning to the remarks of bro-  ther Snow, and wish that all the   people in this Stake had heard them.  We have had a great deal of preach-  ing, and need a great deal, and I   don't know that a people ever lived   who had more.    We are in the valleys of the   mountains for a special purpose-to   establish righteousness and live in   accordance with the principles of   truth. There never was a generation   of people who had so much to per-  form as the Latter-day Saints have.  This work is progressing, and it will   continue to advance. I have seen   the time when you could get the   whole Church into this room — when   there were a few High Priests, no   Apostles or Seventies, and only a few   Elders. I am as thoroughly satisfied   now as I ever was in my life, that   this is the kingdom of God. I am as   firm a believer in God, in the reve-  lations of God, in the Books of Mor-  mon and Doctrine and Covenants, as   I ever was. I have read the prophe-  cies of Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel and   other inspired writers, and have seen   some of them fulfilled, and expect   to see others have their literal ful-  fillment. God worked with the   children of men through revelation,   and he will continue to do so in this   generation. With him there is no   change; his ways are one eternal   round.    The Lord has directed and guided   this work from the beginning. The   prophecies relating to the present   dispensation — to Zion being estab-  lished in the tops of the mountains —  to the building of cities and Temples 
 THE WORK PROGRESSING, ETC. 135    — are being fulfilled. We have no-  thing to do but build up the king-  dom of God, and the more light and   understanding we get, the less our   hearts will cling to outside things.  While we are engaged in this work,   we can realize that holy angels are   watching us. The Lord told us,   forty-seven years ago, what would   take place, and we are now fulfilling   that which he spoke of. Brothers   Joseph and Brigham are gone into   the spirit world, but there are a few  of us left to continue the work laid   out by the Almighty. We have   preached to the world, organized the   Priesthood and the Saints, and   angels have borne record of this, and   it is recorded in heaven — our toil,   our preaching, and our testimony.  We have filled these once desert   places with Saints of the living God,  and many thousands are here who   never saw the world. We have to   build Temples — one is almost com-  pleted and is dedicated; we have   laid the foundations of others, and  the work, like a panorama, is before   us. This labor is not to be per-  formed by other hands. God looks   to us to build these Temples, and to   bring about the redemption of the   earth. He holds us responsible for   this work; we have to preach to   the house of Israel — to the Laman-  ites — to gather together the honest   in heart from all parts of the earth.  We are chosen to perform this great   and important work-we, a small   handful of people compared with the   millions of human beings on the   earth. The Lord does not expect   any other people but the Latter-day   Saints to do this work; there is no-  body else preparing.    One after another of our brethren   have left us and gone to labor on the   other side of the veil. President   Brigham Young, brother George A.  Smith, and others before them, have   all gone, and the few that are left of   the Twelve will also go by and by;  but while here, it is our duty to   labor on the foundation they have   laid. President Young labored hard   and faithful during the last few years   of his life in organizing and building   up Zion. We have to continue the   work they were engaged in, and   when our time comes to take our   departure for that life behind the   veil, none of us will regret having   devoted our time, talents, and labor   for the accomplishment of this great   object. The riches of the world will   appear as the dust under our feet   compared with the eternal reward   before us.    This kingdom will never be given   into the hands of another people.  We may pass away, but our sons and   daughters will have the labor on  their shoulders of building up the   kingdom.    Many of you may have read, years   before it was fulfilled, the revelation   and prophecy of the Prophet Joseph   in regard to the trouble, anarchy,  and war that should befall this na-  tion. Wise men said its fulfillment   was a matter of impossibility-that   the government was too sound and   too well established for such a cala-  mity to occur, but the fulfillment   came. When the Lord undertakes   to perform a work, he is certain to   carry it out. It would not take the   Lord twenty-four hours to cause   war, anarchy, confusion, and judg-  ments to come upon the nation. He   is withholding these calamities until  his purposes are accomplished.    The set time has come, and the   world is preparing itself for these   things. The Church and kingdom of   God must adorn itself, and prepare   for the coming of the Great Bride-  groom. Every key relating to this   dispensation was given to the Pro-  phet Joseph, and they remain with 
 136 JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.    the Priesthood today. We have no   right to walk in the dark. The   burden is now resting upon us, and,   holding the Priesthood, our aim   should be building up of the   kingdom of God. We hold the   Priesthood for that purpose, and we   have no business to use it for any-  thing else but to officiate in the   ordinances of the house of God.    Sooner or later we shall have to   obey the law of death. As it is   written, "In Adam all died, so in   Christ shall all be made alive."  We  shall have to pass through the ordeal   — there is no escape from it. We  have, consequently, no time to throw   away. It may be asked, "How   much longer will it be before the   winding up scene takes place?  It   is not for me to say. How much  longer have the Elders to suffer  violence at the hands of the wicked?  It appears to me that the world is   about ripe for the judgments of the   Lord, and that the testimony will   soon be sealed. He is already work-  ing with the Lamanites, and he will   accomplish a great deal in a little   time.    Some people entertain the idea  that because wheat is plentiful and   selling at exceedingly low figures,  the probability of a famine is more   remote than ever; but the Lord   makes no mistakes about what is   going to transpire. He has decreed  the visitation of judgments, and they   are certain to take place. President   Young has for years repeatedly im-  pressed upon the brethren the neces-  sity of preparing for a period of   famine by storing their wheat, and,   before his death, was impressed to   speak to the sisters and urge them   to look after that matter. Let us   be united in our labors, and in all  the branches of industry that males   or females may be engaged in. The  raising of silk may be rendered an   important item in the industry of   this Territory. It is a business that   our wives and children can engage  in, and there is nothing to hinder   the people from becoming rich from   this branch of industry alone. There   is an improvement in the United   Order, or Co-operation. The Saints   are preparing themselves for that   event when Jesus shall come as a   thief in the night. For our own  sakes let us do the best we possibly   can. We must observe and keep  the laws of God, in order to inherit   the rewards promised. Let us not   set our hearts on the riches and   vanities of this earth. It is very   convenient, it is true, to have the   comforts of life around us, but we   shall be better without them, if by   hoarding up the riches of the world   we forget the things of God.    I pray God to bless you and our   sons and daughters, that their minds   may be led and prepared for the   work they will be called upon to   perform. 
 Apostle W. Woodruff addressed the congregation Said.    Joseph Smith was asked once by a clergaman, if all the   people outside of the mormons, to which the Prophet replied   yes, and one half of them if they do not repent.    Spake of the great number of men and women who had joined   the church, and afterwards apostatise from the church.  And lost   their Priesthood, their power, Glory, dommions.    Read a prayer offered up by Joseph the Prophet in Liberty Jail, in   relation to the long sufferring endured by hinself & coreligen-  ousts.  The general duties of the Saints was dwelt upon, and,   the magmatude of the great work before us.  Spoke of   great benifit the B. Y. Academy was doing in the land and   hoped it would receive the liberal support of the Saints.  encouraged the Young to qualify themselves for the great   work before them. 
 Pres. W. Woodruff: Spoke of the dealing of   God in the history of the world.  Had noticed   that whenever nations departed from the paths   of vuirtuue and righteousness, they were cast   down.  Whenever men served God he upheld and   and sustained them.  But of all the changes   that have taken place from Father Adam one   thing has never changed -- and that is the Gos-  pel of Jesus Christ.  Referred to the mechanical  improvements of the latter times, all tending to   the gathering of Isreal in these days.  Spoke of   ancient prophecy and its litteral fulfillment.  Spoke of the stupendous work of the Saints in   the few years they have been in the valleys of   Ephraim.  Spoke of the swift judgments that   would come upon those who have persecuted   the Saints.  We have not got through with the   warning of the nations.  I am getting more en-  larged in my feelings regarding the people of   the nations, we are baptizing a hundred a month   in the Southern States.  The Lord will fight our   battles if we will keep his commandments and   build his temples.  The young men will have to   bear off this kingdom.  Made a powerful exhort-  tation to the Saints to be faithful. 
 Apostele Woodruff made remarks as follows. Said  that while he was in Arizona Gen. Sherman [rewoh]  was there; remarked that it was a shame for the govern-  ment to charge the Mormans any thing for the land.  But the time will come when we will see the  blessings and wisdom displayed in sending that  that colony. As I have often said, it seemed almost  impossible toofor mortal man to live in these valleys when  we first come here. But we shall soon understand  why God wants these places setted. The Lord re-  quires many things of us that has not been required  of others generations. The Lord expects us to work  with him in the redemption of his Kingdom. The time  will come when we will be required to practice  what we teach. Important events are about to transpire  in Zion. 
 BLESSINGS, ETC.    BLESSINGS--TRIALS--OBEDIENCE TO COUNSEL, ETC.  Remarks by Elder Wilford Woodruff, delivered in the Bowery, Great Salt Lake City,  Sunday Morning, September 27, 1857,    We are glad to see the brethren   return home from their long missions   or short ones.  We are glad to greet   them, to hear them talk, to see their   faces, and to hear their testimony that   the Lord has been with them,  These   things are a pleasure to us who re-  main here in Zion.  There are a   multiplicity of evidences that God is   with this people, and that the Lord   has been with his Elders, wherever  they have been, from the beginning   of this work.    There has been something peculiar   connected with the Elders of this   Church from the beginning.  You   may take the rest of the world, poli-  tically, temporally, spiritually, or any   other way ; and there never has been  such an example in the eyes of hea-  ven, earth, or hell as has been in the   Elders of this Church, in preaching  this Gospel to the nations of the   earth.  The hand of God has been   in the work from the beginning, and   it is in it yet; and the hand of the   Lord has been with them to succour   them all the time.  The revelations   given from heaven, through Joseph,   concerning the Elders, have been   fulfilled to the very letter.    There are many things that are   consoling ; and one is, to know that   the Lord is with us—that he does   reveal his mind and will in the ordi-  nances of the house of God, and   through the administration of bles-  sings, whether by Patriarchs, or by   the Twelve Apostles, or in the endow-  ments.  We find those blessings are   fulfilled to the very letter.    The brethren to-day have spoken   in reference to the blessings that are   given to our brethren when they go   out on their missions to the various   nations of the earth.  I remember   the day very well when we blessed those   missionaries that went to India and to   Europe; and I must say that I never   had such a variety of feelings as I had   at that time.    In blessing brother Luddington,   I recollect that I was mouth, and I   well remember that I could see   nothing but seas, waves, and storms.  The seas appeared to be heaped up,  and I knew that he was going to see   storms and be exposed to troubles   and dangers.  But there was one   thing that we did bless those brethren   with that I rejoice in, and that is   that they should return home again.    Well, our words have all been ful-  filled to the very letter, and this gives   us consolation.  If we go forth, and   have the Priesthood and Apostleship   upon us, the Holy Spirit of God,   though it may not be visible,   does dictate to us; and it is so in   ordaining:  it is so in going to battle   against the nations of the earth, who   have given their consent to the shed-  ding of the blood of the Prophets.    Brother Brigham feels calm and   serene as a summer's morning; and   in his desire to save Israel he wishes   to save also the lives of our enemies,  if possible.  Why is he so calm and 
 JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.    steady?  It is because God is with   him; and though armies are ap-  proaching and ready, apparently, to   swallow up this people, yet he and   his brethren feel calm, and the Lord   reveals unto them, by the Holy Spirit,  how to govern and control this people.  They have had a long experience in   proving the Almighty God, who holds   the destiny of the Saints and the   sinner.  And has he ever failed us?  No, never.    Some of our brethren have told   their trials here to-day, and they have   said that they have not done much;  but the greatest work they have done   has been in saving themselves.  But   this is not all they have done.  They   have done something else; they have   accomplished the purposes of God in   India—as much so as though they had   baptized every king and queen in   those islands:  they have literally   fulfilled the revelations of Jesus   Christ in carrying the Gospel unto   them, because those nations could   not have been left without excuse   and the earth prepared for the judg-  ments of God, if those Elders had   not gone and preached to the people   of those nations.  No matter if they   had not have baptised one, they are   as much justified as we who first went   to Herefordshire, England, and bap-  tised twenty or thirty priests in a   day.  They have fulfilled the com-  mandments in carrying the Gospel to   the nations.    It is no testimony to me that a   man is not faithful, because he has   not baptised numbers of princes,   lords, governors, and kings; not at   all.  The Lord has sent them there:   he has tried them and put them in   strait places; but has he left them?  No, he has not.  Has he not brought   them forth?  We have had the testi-  mony of brother Musser, who is here;  and we see that it is the hand of God   that has been over them, and we are   glad of it; and we do not expect that   the Lord will send the Elders out   there again until they have other   missionaries and messengers that they   cannot stone, tar, or feather, but mes-  sengers that will come with their   sharp sickles:  then they will find   that they have messengers that they   cannot conquer or overcome.    I feel to rejoice in these things  and to know that the Lord is at work  with this people.  We are living in a   fast age—an age fraught with great   events, and every day is bringing to   pass more of the predictions; and   more revelation is being fulfilled   in one year, now, than has been fulfilled  in centuries before.  We are living in   a day when that flood of revelation is   coming to a focus; and that focus we   stand in, and we are seeing it fulfilled   day by day.    The wicked rage and the heathen   imagine a vain thing; and they say,   "Let us go and take a prey and a   spoil; let our eye be upon Zion, and let   her be defiled."  But they know not the   thoughts of the Lord, neither under-  stand they his counsel.  God will  work for us and defend us, if we do   our duty, and Zion will soon be free.  We will not suffer the oppressions of   our enemies as we have done.    You need not fear: all we have to   do is to be passive in the hands of the   Lord, and follow the counsel of our   leaders, and not be particularly anx-  ious that the Lord should reveal to   you or to me his mind and will and   intentions concerning our present   difficulties; but pray earnestly that   the Spirit of the Lord may be upon   those men who stand at the head.  All we have to do is to live our reli-  gion; and when the Presidency say   "Come here," or "Go there," let us   be on hand to obey, and all will be   right.    Let the people be quiet and pray  that God may reveal his mind and will  to those at the head.  We may have   our ideas of what we should do in this 
 BLESSINGS, ETC.    or that case; but there is no man so   well qualified to lead, govern, and   direct for the salvation of the people   as that man whom God has appointed.  We have as good leaders as we need.  There never was a better leader given   to Israel, nor one more capable of   leading this people to salvation, than  Brigham Young: he is filled with the   Spirit of God day by day.  If the   United States make war upon this   people, the Lord will hold them re-  sponsible for it, and the measure they   mete will be measured unto them   again; and if they are ripe and the cup  of their iniquity full, they will be shat-  tered to pieces--their union broken up   and destroyed.  They will be visited   with thunder and lightning and hail   and the judgments of God; and   every man that will not draw his sword   against his neighbour will be obliged to   flee to Zion.  They are sending their   armies here to destroy us; but I ask   none to weep for Utah or spend   their sympathy for us—not even my   relatives or the priests, the doctors,   lawyers, or editors; no, not even one   soul—from the President of the United   States down through the whole nation,  who have given consent to our death;  for they will have plenty to bear them-  selves, and they may save their weep-  ing for themselves and their children.  The Lord will teach them that their   proud looks and haughty feelings will   be laid low.  It is right to pray and   it is right to keep our powder dry.  Pray   for the Presidency of this Church--  pray for them to have the Spirit of   revelation.  We have never seen a   day when "Mormonism" was taking   such a stride as it is at the present  time.  They may come over the Plains   singing their songs about what they   will do when they get to Utah; but   many of them will find a place in hell  before they get here.    There have been many truths taught   here to-day.  Many who have been   here for years do not know or realize   the great blessings we are enjoying in  these valleys of mountains. Our gra-  naries are filled with bread and we   enjoy peace and the comforts of life.  We come to the Tabernacle of God and   associate with holy men, and we should   be holy ourselves: if we are not, it is   our own fault.    You have all the blessings which   the celestial kingdom and laws of God   impart unto men on the earth, while   the Gentile nations have suffered ruin,  wickedness, and abominations of every   kind to increase in their midst until  they are ripe for destruction.  Do they   not thirst for the blood of the Saints   and every man who is righteous?  Do   they not delight in wickedness?   They   are full of wrath and anger, and they   are ripe for the damnation of hell.  Yes, the nations of the earth are ripe  to-day.    Then we should be faithful and   diligent in all things committed to   our charge.  Even though the Lord  has suffered some of the brethren to   go through strait places, in days which   are past and gone, and he may still  call us to go through strait places, yet   he will sustain us when we trust in   him.    The Lord has suffered some of our   Prophets and Apostles to be martyred;   and what for?  That the cup of the   iniquity of the nations might be full  and that his servants might be crowned   heirs of God and joint heirs with Jesus   Christ to a martyr's crown.    Through the persecutions of the  enemies of truth, many of the Saints  have been worn out; but, as a body, the   kingdom and people have been led off   as victorious conquerers. We stand   now and hold the keys of the American  continent; we stand in the Strong cham-  bers of the mountains; and can the  Lord God give us the Victory? He  can and he will, and he has been pre-  paring us for this by pouring out upon   us his Holy Spirit, uniting the people  who have been willing to repent and 
 JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.    forsake their sins; and I hope we shall   continue faithful to the end.    I am glad, and my soul rejoices in   these things, and I believe that the   people are ready to shoulder their   guns and walk into these kanyons and   line them from here to Fort Bridger   in defence of the Constitution of the   United States and the rights which   both the laws of God and man guar-  antee to us.    We have had to stoop to our ene-  mies heretofore and bear many things   from them worse than death; but if   there is anything that gives us joy and   consolation—at least, I can speak for   myself—it was when I heard the bre-  thren say, "You are free, brethren—you   are free; and you may prove yourselves   before God and men that you are   willing to defend yourselves against   tyrants and oppressors."    When I heard this, I was full of   joy; and who would not be?  Who would  not rather die than bow down to the   yoke of the enemy?  It would sweeten   death to a man to know that he should  lay down his life in defence of free-  dom and the kingdom of God rather   than to longer bow to the cruelty of   mobs, even if the mob have the name   of being legalized by the nation.    I thank God and I rejoice that this   people are determined to be free from  mobocracy and oppression, and that   they are determined to have peace, if   they have to fight for it; and if the yoke   is ever put on again, it will be by our-   selves: and I say, God bless this people  and the missionaries that have gone   to the nations—no matter whether   they have baptized one or a thousand,  if they have done the will of God.    Notwithstanding the lightnings  may flash, thunders roll, and earth-  quakes bellow, the Lord will extend   his hand over his servants and protect   them as he has done those that have   returned unto us.  And the Lord will   remember our brethren that are on the   Plains; and let us remember them in   our prayers, that the Lord may be on   our side; and let us be on hand   and be ready at any and every call, and  the kingdom will spread abroad, and it   will smite the image not only on the   toes but on the head; which may God   grant for our sake.  Amen. 
 Report of the four months ending April 30th 1878  after which Elder W Wordruff spoke on the  unity of the faith and action among the true  believers in the Gospel of Christ and the des-  position of man in all ages to oppose its ex-  istence 
 At 2 P.M. Meeting resumed Apostle Wordruff —  introduced his remarks with the Quotation "Straight   is the Gate and narrow is the way &c reverting to  the task of the Saints in keeping the path of the  Gospel beset with temptations, which would be over  come with the help of God and faith in his strong  promises to help those who confided in him. spoke  of the rapid growth of the work in Joseph's day special  Revelation was given in regard to special individual  calls for missionary service while now large numbers  are called and set apart for Missionary Service on  account of the demand for their Labors being so great 
 Apostle W Woodruff: refered to the teaching's of  the Prophet Joseph Smith relative to warnings  and impressions recieved at times which should  be acted upon relating incidents of impressions  recieved and acted upon during his life which  had saved his own and the lives of others. 
 Apostle W Woodruff  followed on the bleessings the  observance of the Law of Tithing brought to the  Saints. blessed as we were so apparent to the  traveller passing through our midst, we should  be careful to discharge this law and also meet  all obligations promptly that confidence may be   maintained 
 Prest Willford Woodruff followed, referring   to the great advantages the Latter-day   Saints of the present age had over all the   people to whom God had previously manifested   himself and the Gospel, more Revelations were   given, more inspired men lived to instruct   the people, which together with the easy access   to the inspired works, the Bible, Book of Mormon,  and Doctrine and Covenants, made a combination   of instruction that no other people had prior   to the present day. 
 Prest  W Woodruff: then   addressed the congregation dwelling upon   the great blessings enjoyed by the people   through their obedience to the laws of the   Gospel, referring to the rapid growth of the   people in acquiring the comforts of life around   them, the wonder of the nations at the success   that attended the work and the bitter end of   many of those who had from time to time   opposed the work citing individual cases, exhorting   the people through their knowledge of these facts   to live faithful to their covenants. 
 Prest W Woodruff  then addressed the   audience expressing himself in strong   terms "that the time had come when the   Elders of Israel must pratice what they   teach in order to effect upon the minds of   the people," especially should it be or in   regard to the Word of Wisdom: concluding   with "I view you Brethren holding the priesthood   as chosen before the world was, to work here   upon the Earth to support his cause. 
 PRESIDENT'S OFFICE,  Salt Lake City, Utah, Aug. 30, 1888.    Elder James W. Bean,    Stake Clerk, Utah Stake.    DEAR BROTHER:    Your communication of the 27th. inst., addressed to myself and the  Quorum of the Twelve, informs me that, in accordance with a resolution adopted  by the unanimous vote of the priesthood of Utah Stake, you send your communica-  tion asking for ten thousand dollars -[$10000.00]- of the tithing of the Stake  for the current year, to aid you in the completion of the Utah Stake Tabernacle.    The position of the Church in financial matters is such at the  present time that it is impossible for us to comply with this resolution. We  shall have to strain every nerve and use all the means within our possession,  or that is likely to come into our possession for some time, to meet the engage-  ments that are already contracted. In view of this, the Council of the Apostles  some weeks ago decided to cease making appropriations, for the present, for the  benefit of any meeting houses in our settlements. We have had a number of  applications since then, which we have filed away, to be taken up in their order  when circumstances become more favorable. The case at which the Council stopped 
 was one that appealed very strongly to their sympathies, but it was thought  that it was a good place to stop at, as there would probably be no other case  that would be likely to call forth aid more strongly than it. The present  prospect is that we shall need all the tithing tahat we can collect to meet  outstanding engagements and to pay our currect expenses; and if we can do this  without contracting debts, we shall feel happy.    Trusting this explanation will be satisfactory to the priesthood of  Utah Stake, and regretting the necessity which compels this line of action,    I remain, Your Brother,  Wilford Woodruff 
 Copy  Salt Lake City, Utah  April 7, 1881  Dear Bro. John W. Young,  Elders Erastus Snow, Brigham Young  and Jesse N. Smith were appointed last fall   by the First Presidency of the church  in counjunctionwith yourslef to take charge of  the interests of the saints and the care and  oversight of all their parties which might be  working on the lines of the Denver and Rio Gande  and Altantic and Pacific Railroad in grading,  furninshing ties, laying track +c, and to make  contracts and to asist in making contracts  in their interests, and instruct and counsel   them in the duties of their religion, and in   the management of their busness affairs,  and in securing the means that should be   due to them upon their contracts.  A Letter   of Instructions was written by the First   Presidency for the guidance of these Elders  and yourself in the duties assigned to you,  in which you were directed to do everything   necessary to give all equal rights in the various  jobs and you were instructed to see that  the supplies should be provided Rubyech  to the action or adjustment of the Various  boards, no one man, or a few men to receive  the profits there from and that everything  was to be done in the mlerch of all.  That 
 Letter said  "I wish to impress upon you and the brethren  who will labor in the conjunction with you, that  it is not the privelege of any man or company  of men to take advantage of the circumstances  of the people and their necessities and farm  them out for their private profit.  As latter  day-Saints we are all equal, and we should   labor for each other's benefit--and no man   should selfishly build himself up or enrich  himself at the expense of his brother or  brethren.  If he has superior advantages  either of position or of skill, let him have  a fair remumeration there for;but beyond   this he should not go.  He should labor as we   all should for the welfare, advancement and   prosperity of the people.  In this way good   feeling will be maintained and the saints   will see that their leading men are their true  friends, and are not disposed to oppress them  and to make mechandise of them.  There is freah  room for the mereaso of confidence in this  direction, and we hope that you will   dr use all your influence in creating their con-  fidence and in showing your brethren that we have their true welfare at heart.  If we  take this course and act together in this manner  among ourselves, and maintains the same principles  of equity in our dealings with other who are 
 not of us, the reputation of the Latter-day-  Saints will be greatly increased and influence  will be created in our favor that will result in   incalculable benefit to us as a people, for   the world is so destitute of these qualities  that when people witness them they are im-  pressed by theim and recognise and acknowledge  their worth.  as to yourselves, for the labor hwich you   perform among the people in counselling, in  directing, in securing contracts and in seemy  that all the business is properly alleuded to,  and that the pay can be relied upon, you  should derive a reasonable percentage.  We   have thought that in view of all the expenses  connected with the labor, five per cent  would be a proper amount; but of course  when you many other agents secure contracts  and perform other labor connected there with,  for this small percentage, it should not be  expected that you will, in the event of the   company failing to make payments, be responisble  for the Day."  since the return of the elders Erastus Snow   and Brigham Young we have leaned that  they and Borther Jesse, N. Smith submitted a memorandum in writing to you embodying some of the principal points of the letter  of instructions and requiring you to hold 
 sacred the money received in estimates for grading  less the maount necessary for to pay for  supples furnished and sking for [your] action  on your part with them in securing to the  sub contractors just dues under the contracts  mad eiwhtthem by Elders Brigham Young   and Jesse N. smith.  Mis. Memo: they signed  and requested you to sign, but we are in-  formed you declined to do so, thought, you had   telegraphed, upon receipt of the letter of instructions that you  accepted and would be governed by the provisions of that letter  and this was, and is the under=  standding of the entire Council res=  pecting your telegrams to Brother Brigham.  Viewing your action in   refusing to sign this memorandum  submittd to you as a vioation  of the Letter of instructions and  a breach of faith with the Coun=  cil, and a departure from your expressed agreement, the Council  of the Twelve Apostles has de-  cided that it could not present  your ame at the Conferenc eto  the people as a counsellor.  It was therefore omitted without 
 comment.  The Council has also decided that you be summon=  ed to appear before it in this   City forth with to show cause  why you hould not be dealt with accorning to the laws of the  Church for this conduct.  You   will please accept this letter as   a summons to thus appear  Please telegraph me  when you will be her as the  Council is waiting  I remain  Your Brother  Signed W.

 [Pres] Woodruff    Steuben may the 17th 1849    Sir as my husband was gone from  home when your pusilarimous letter arrived it fell in  to my hands, and I feell it my duty however painful  it may be to answer it.  I feell if I should (hold  my peace the verry stones would cry out) you accuse  him of intxoriaation in Philladelphia, and of pleading  inocent as to his his getting intoxicated, this I know is false  as them stroct told it, he has told me every circum-  stance concerning his being taken by the watchman  he had got fatigued and sick traveling from Pittburg  in those dirity Secltion Bats that he came in, and set  himself down to rest a while, (having no money to get  him a lodging) he got a sleep and when the watch  found him he thought he was some suspicious looking  person, and for the sake of the fee which he knew he would  get he took time to the wash him to the wach house notwithstanding  my Husband told him he was inocent and for  that reason told him who he was, and showed his papers  to proove it.  But as it was the Officer prooved to be  a latter Saint then those that bore the name, he gave  him money to help him on his journey, for ^he^ repented of  what he had done, he did not stand back as those holy  brothers did but he saw he was in distress and administered  to his wants.  Which do you think done the will of his  Heavenly father; I suppose you know that my Husband  came in company with Dudley, my Husband had money 
 Washington City Jan. 17th [18]50    Dear Brother,    Your kind favor of the 10th   was received yesterday. The intelligence from  the valley is quite cheering.  The discovery of a coal   an iron are of far more value to us than a gold  mine would be. Since my arrival here I have  been pretty busy among grave Senators, impulsive  representatives of the people, and other functionaries.  Business progresses very slowly in Congress, the organ-  ization of the House is not yet completed, though  more than six weeks of the session have already  passed. Though there is scarcely a ray of hope of  our admission into the Union as a State, the prospect  of our obtaining a territorial ^organization^ is far from being  discouraging, and an influential Senator has  given me encouragement to hope that we may be  authorized to elect our own officers. Some time  ago I understood that Mr Stanton of Kentucky had  received a remonstrance to our memorial.  I suspect-  ed its character and called to see him, he kindly  favored me with a perusal of it. It charges us  with a number of the foulest deeds & abominations  in the dark catalogue of crimes, and is signed  by William Smith and thirteen others.  Mr  Stanton was very friendly, but deemed it his duty  to present it in the House.  On the 31st Ult. Senator    [sideways text]  The probability is that our application for a government will not be  disposed of before  May or June July or August.    Dr. J. M.

 enough to have brought him along comfortable but Dudly  had none therefore my husband devided with him to the last  cent before he got to Philadelphia, Dudley promised to get  money there and pay him, but instead of that he shiped  him there, and left him without money or friends.  That is a speceman of the dealings of laterday saints. but  I thank my Hea^v^enly father that the time is a coming  when he will meet his accusers face to face then will  it be known who is the mi[s]erable slanderers' and the  inocent shall then be made known, And let Orson  Hide beware! God will not alway have an unriteous  judge over his people, nor will those that would walk  uprightly suffer persecution, Prehaps you may think I  write this with some bitterness of feelling, I have reason to  I have seen enough of their dealings with my Husband  and I can hold my peace no longer. So long as my Husban  money to give those dear brothers, and a home for then  month after month it was all well enogh, but when  he was reducted in his circumstances by fowllowing them  west by the mob, and sickness and he had nothing more  to give; then he must be cast off as not worth saveing.  This looks like buying Salvation with dtoo dear a price  and if we are ever saved I trust it will be with  those of better principles, as to the papers you allude to  I knew not that he had any if hear I will find them and  burn them for they can be of little use to him, as he has to work  at his trade, to support his family besides there is no-one here that  heran would hear the Doctrine praeached, and I should hear to 
 Underwood of Ky. electrified the Senate by the presentation  of a copy of the same remonstrance in the Senate.  The honorable Senator was somewhat excited, gave  a synopsis of its contents, thought the charges aught  to be investigated, and moved its reference to the  Committee on Territories of which he is a member.  The other remonstrance was also presented in the House  the same day, an abstract of which appeared in the  papers the following morning, and created consider-  able sensation. The same evening I called at Judge  Underwood's, but he was absent, however the next morn-  ing I had an interview with ^him,^ and another two or three  days afterward, explained matters to him, and got  him pretty well satisfied.  I also called on the  Chairman of the Committee on Territories in the  House, and other members,and with the review of  counteracting the effect it had produced and was  producing I deemed it expedient to have the enclosed  article published in the Republic, the government organ  and afterward called on the editors of ^the^ Union,  Globe and National Intelligencer, and requested  them to republish it while they did, two of them  with some prefatory remarks. Immediately after  this I received, and I thanked God for it, Mr  Kinkead's account, and other favorable intelligence  from the valley, which I have had published in  the four principal papers of this city.  I omitted to  mention that Mr. Underwood at the time he presented 
 what he said just as soon with out the papers, as with them.    I would never hurt my Husbands feellings by leting him  see the letter you sent if he has not allready seen you as he  proposed to do, ^when he^ whent away, I epect he is on his return  now in a vessel that malled from this port.    God: forgive me if I say any thing amiss, but when I think how  my husband was respected before he came in to this Church, in  the Baptist church to which he belonged he was beloved as a  member, and looked up to as one of the pillars of the church and  now he must be belied by a set of misecrents that is not worthy  to carry his old shoes after him, and as long as I can speak I will  not hear my husband so belied as I know he has been and hold my  peace, this you may tell Orson Hide on any one else.  I know how  my husband was treated in St Louis by the Presideing Elder and other  would be  [page torn] ask Brother E T Benson he knows my husband better  than any one else and prehaps will render a more just account.    I do not blame you for I well know by whose instignation it is that  you speak as you do, and I hope I shall not say anything to hurt your  feellings but you must be ware how you condem an inocent man  who posesses more soul than as many of those (insignificant beings I  could mention) as could stand between here and the salt lake.  Prehaps if my husband was here he would not allow me to write as  I do but it is my first feellings from the impulse of the moment  I would like to have you write to me and give me such coulnirel  as you think I need and the progress of the church for I have heard  nothing since I left St Louis last fall, give my love to sister  woodruff for I e^s^teem her as a worthy woman ask he to write  me    Yours Respectfully  Cynthia Dam 
 William Smith's memorial, he also read a paragraph  from a newspaper accusing ^us^ with having arrested  Gen Wilson, Pomeroy and others, and imposing a duty  of 50 per cent on all merchandize brought into the   valley.  Senator Truman Smith informed me on Sat-  urday evening that he had just received a letter  from Gen Wilson ^who spent some time in the valley en route for California^ in which he spoke of our people  in the most flattering terms, that he had really used  strong language, that he had written to the President  enclosing Gen Wilson's letter, and when he returned  it, he would publish so much of it as relates to Deseret  and its inhabitants with some remarks of his own.  I shall have it immediately republished in all the  principal papers of the City.  I shall send you  a copy of it.  I have addressed a note to the Honorable  Senator to-day, requesting him to give it publicity  at his earliest convenience.  I was presented to the  President some time since, and stated to him the  object of my visit to Washington, his reply was, "That  lies in the breast of Congress." A report has recently  been in circulation to a limited extent, that the  President had said at a dinner party at the White  House that he would veto any bill that may be  passed for the benefit of the Mormons, and I have  reason to beleive that it is not entirely without  foundation in truth, but notwithstanding that  there will be no difficulty in that quarter I beleiieve  on what I regard as excellent authority.  Col Kane  was here for about a week in the begining of the
