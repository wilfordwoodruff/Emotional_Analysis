Brethren and Sisters As President of the church I have many Duties to Perform As have these my councillers and the Apostles And I feel  impressed to make a Declaration unto you at this time It is reppresented to us that there is about fourteen  hundred Millions of Human beings upon the Earth at the present time And while I am strongly impressed  with the Principles of the Eternal truths of the Dealings of the Dealings of God with the inhabitants of the  Earth in the Day and generation in which we live  I wish to Ask this Assembly a question. What  Protection have this vast body of Human being to Enable them to Escape those tremendious Judg- ments which GOD has proclaimed shall come to pass and be poured out upon the wicked in the  last days before the coming of the Son of Man These Judgments are recorded in the Bible the Revelations of St John, The Book of Mormon and Doctrins and Covenants The men who made these Declarations were Prophets, Apostles, and inspird Men and spoke as they were moved upon by the Holy Ghost And their word^s^ were true.

Wherever the Eternal  Everlasting and Holy Priesthood or its influence Dwells there is Protection and salvation and Nowhare Els. For the ritghts of the Priesthood are  inseparably connected with the Heavens and the Heavens can ownly be controlled upon the principles of righteousness The Lord Revealed to Joseph Smith the Prophet  and said that Angels were standing in the Temple  in Heaven holding in their hands sharp sickles and crying  unto God dDay and night saying let us go down and  reap down the fields. But the Lord said unto them pluck not up the tares while the Blade is yet tender Lest you  destroy the wheat also wait untill the wheat is gathered  and the tares bound in Bunddles then the field rem- aineth to be burned I now bear testimony to this Assembly that that day has come. These destroying Angels are sent forth to visit the Earth and have  commencd to poor out the Judgments of God  upon the wicked and will continue untill the  scene is wound up and all fulfilled that God  has promised.
