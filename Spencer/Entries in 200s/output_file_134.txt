 June 21 [189]8    President W. Woodruff  Salt Lake City   Utah    Dear Brother,    Our regular Quarterly   Conference was held at Parker Sunday   and Monday 19 & 20th inst.  We had   with us President Seymour B. Young  Elder Douglas M. Todd and Wm. M.  Palmer, the Stake Presidency, Patriarch   and most of the High Council.  There   was a large attendence of the Presiding   Officers and saints. President Young   spoke to us three times during conference   and gave us much valuable instruction.  The church and stake officers were   all unanimously sustained and we   never had a more enjoyable conference.  Our crop prospects all over our   stake are good and the health of the   people good Your Brother in the Gospel  T E Ricks 
 742  July 22  8  Pres. W. Woodruff   Salt Lake City, Utah   Dear Brother,    Your favor of yesterday to   hand informing us of the suggestion of   the First Presidency and apostles to   change the name of our stake to   Fremont for reasons given.  While  there is not time to lay the matter   before our people before replying to   you now we are satisfied the change   will neet with their approval and   we the undersigned freely acquiesce,  Brother Wm. F. Rigby being at present   in Teton valley and not here to   sign with us.    Your Brethren in the Gospel  F E Ricks 
 610   Mar 24  8  Pres. W. Woodruff and Counselors  Salt L. City Utah   Dear Brethren:    Your favor of the 22nd   inst to hand in which you ask two further   question relative to the stand I took on the   county seat proposition, the first is:  When I   originally endorsed the movement was I not   acquainted with the arguments I now use, and if   I was, who did I at first countenance the effort.    Replying to this I beg to say that I do not wish   to be understood as originally endorsing the move, but   after considerable agitation by[ illegible] our citizens   I did consent and took part in appointing a   council to simply investigate what could be   done and whether as it ^was^ contended by some to   say as a absolutely [clear] legally, and to report their   findings before any definite action should be   taken, but that I at first countenanced the action   of [illegible] I most explicitly deny.    After this committe has made their report I can   [illegible] the approval by 
 technicalities [illegible] though we might perchance   surmount[ illegible] an expense that I felt   [illegible] would ^be^ [illegible] to incur.  I had also by this time   made a [illegible ] of the [illegible ] we might   reasonably expect in our favor, which demonstrated to   me it was better to drop the matter for the present as  [illegible]    Your second question was, why I declined to give   those interested the reasons for any change of base.  I [illegible] to say as before that stated, that I had not   changed my base, but that I invited some of the   members of this community to meet me at my office   at a given time, that I might give them my   [illegible ] in this matter, they however invited others  not of our faith and who had previously proven   [illegible ] to our people to offend and while   those [illegible] were all presentI did not feel at   liberty to speak as freely on the subject as I   otherwise would have done.  I was there and then   in my own office indirectly accused of being   bribed by one of our own brethren in the presence   of a roomfull of those interested,   
 left the office before I had an opportunity of   speaking to him as freely as I otherwise would have   been pleased to do.  These brethren are the facts   in the case as far as I am able to tell them at   present.  If however there is anything further that   you wish to ask I shall be pleased to answer them   as far as I am able.  Awaiting your further   pleasure I remain    Your [illegible]  T. E. Ricks 
 May 5  8    President W. Woodruff  Salt Lake City  Utah    Dear Brother,    Replying to your ? of ?th net.  in which you inquire concerning the propriety  of calling Bro. H. P. Hansen, of Salem,  to go on a mission to Scandinavia, will  say that Brother Hansen is well advanced  in years and we do not think his physical  strength would warrant us in recommending  in for a foreign mission.    We herewith enclose regular  blank containing the name of Joseph M  vorkman recommended for a mission  I am your Brother in the Gospel    T E Ricks 
 President Wilford Woodruff S L City Sept 12th, 1885.    In exile for the Gospel —    Beloved brother & Friend — Feeling how poor a correspondent   I am not only to you but to all my friends lately, I will   try to pen a few lines — a moments reflection will remind   you that to keep along I have to do considerable that would   be done by others who are absent if they could have liberty   to be at their posts and do their parts. I feel thankful that   I have my liberty as yet and also feel disposed with pleasure   to do all I can to promote the interests of the work in every   way I can. I was sorry to hear of the swelling of your   feet, an acquaintance of mine who was affected the same   way drank freely of celery root beer for a few days and it   left entirely.    Great interest is felt by many as to the approaching term of Court   which meets next Monday. Hopt is the first for trial if a Jury   can be obtained - then Brs. Jno Sharp, H. B. Clawson & H. Dinwoody   are set for the 28th of this month and after them 18 other cases of   [Po]lygamy & Cohabitation. There is much speculation as to how   [text faded] first three cases will go, thinking that as the go, others will  [text faded] likely to follow. Somethings have been fixed up so that if 
 good faith is kept our brethren in Arizona and all those   in Detroit will feel the benefit of it shortly.  It is not   best to know too much about some of these things.    Our affairs in Mexico have been looking very encouragingly   until a day or two since a telegram arrived as follows   "Contract failed — proposition was withdrawn. We start home  tonight."  Thus it looks as if that cup was dashed from our   lips.    The President, Bro. G. Q Cannon & L. J. Nuttall were well   and joyful in the Lord only a few evenings since.  My son Franklin expects to start for Washington soon to   see if another case can be got before the U. S. Supreme Court   for another decision by them.  Your letter from Ashleys Fork  was read by the presidency and by John H. Smith, who start-  -ted day before yesterday to visit those settlements in company   in company of Prest. A. Hatch in hopes to regulate some of   those matters. It is not yet determined whether the semi-  annual ^Conference^ will be held, or if so, where?  The work goes on good  and strong in the Logan Temple, and without cessation,  generally over 100 daily.    Last week we got off a reinforcement of Elders with President   Wm M. Palmer to the N. Western States — and last week and this we   have got off companies to the Southern States and expect to   send 20 more early in next month to Bro. Morgan's aid   yesterday and day before 3 cases from Heber City were before the   Commission & 2 were sent to the Grand Jury, so the work goes on,  with an occasionable lull. We have just had a heavy quiet   rain that has turned to snow on the Mts. and has greatly cooled   the atmosphere and exchanged deep dust for mud.  Bro. Jaques will inform you of your family as he is better   posted than I am as to their condition. I hope your enemies   may not find you & that your health may be preserved unto you   with much comfort of the Spirit to cheer you in your loneliness.    Your brother in the Everlasting Covenant  F. D. Richards. 
 Prest. W. Woodruff  S L City  Feb. 18th 1886    In Obscurity    Dear Brother. I am thankful to learn this mor-  ning that you are still unfound by your hunters.    On hearing some one say that papers had been  seen in Mchands of an officer the day the search  was made here -- (Feb 8th) I enquired it out and this  morning am furnished the following, by brother  William Chinerell. He says that br. John Barrell, the  brother of Charles Barrell whose family live in the base-  ment of this Historian Building, was present when the  officers came to their door and demanded to know  by what authority he undertook to make the search  upon which the officer, who he says was Capt Greenman  took from his pocket five papers one had the name of  John Taylor on its outside, another had Geo. Q. Cannon and  a third had W. Woodruff, but the other two he did not get  to see the names they bore. By this you see how nearly  you came to having the paper served on you.    Yesterday afternoon I went in company with J. H. Smith  H. J. Grant, & J. W. Taylor and visited Prest. Geo. Q. Cannon, who 
 his residence at his farm. The doctors Anderson  & Young, had dressed his wounds & he had slept about  two hours & felt nice bright and joyful on seeing us.  He conversed freely, but we rather carefully avoided  making conversation so as not to weary him too much  His face is somewhat marred just more but the doctors  think it will so heal as not to be much scarred.    We spent one hour or so with him anointed & blessed  him. His family were all in the City and before the  Inquisition by which they ^officials^ endeavor to make all they  can against him.    Fairchild (E. L.) went on his way. We learn by a   letter from him dated at the Palace Hotel ^San-Francisco^ of his safe  arrival at that place. Hill & Arnold went on to  California. Bro Cannon's whole affair seems very strange  but the facts are that his departure was known and he  was given away right at the start.    Br. Henry Dinwoodey is having a very interesting time  today in the Court. It appears that what was done  in his case yesterday has to be done over again and  probably ^in^ another way. I hope  you may successfully  elude your pursuers still. F.M.L. & B.Y. are in  hiding but I know not where. I hear from them occasion-  ally. I am still thankfully your brother in the Gospel    F. D. Richards. 
 Lewis Allen Esqr S L City Feb 20 1886    Dear Brother    E. S. Fairbanks S. H. Hill  and O. P. Arnold are said to have been with Br. Cannon  when the letter was arrested. Fairbanks is supposed  to have had with him twelve thousand dollars, with  which to make a payment on the purchase of a  place which the brethren in Chihuahua had con-  cluded to purchase of Signior Campo, if I recollect  right.    John H. Smith is down with Rheumatism, B. Y.  and F. M. L. keep hid. Prest Taylor was well the  last I heard of him. I had a letter from him today.    Your warm friend Ezra T. Clark send his very kind re-  membrance to you and wished me to say that he would  come any night whenever you say & take you safely to his  place where he can keep you securely from knowledge of  others & he will esteem it a pleasure to do so whenever you  will let him know.    I want to know what you have to say about letting  brother Andrew Jensen have the free access to all the books and 
 records in the office as he wants. It has not  seemed proper to me to permit it. He asked for the  privilege to examine and verify some dates which  I told him he could do, but I find that he means the  liberty to examine every book case & get everything  and everything that he may wish to find & plunder  it for his private interests, and to make his paper  interesting. I shut him off and told him plainly  that I could not permit it. That he must have liberty  from you or Prest Taylor I before he could be permitted  to have free access to the office and all it contains.  Will you please give me your views when you  write again so I may let him know what to depend  upon.    No more now oh yes Bro Cannon  rested well last night & was not quite so [overpligued]  as the night before.    Goodbye & the Lord preserve you  Your Brother in Christ    F. D. Richards. 
 S. L. City,  11 Sept. 1891    Presidents W. Woodruff, George Q.   Cannon, and Joseph F. Smith.    Dear Brethren:    Brother Martin S. Lindsay,  who works in the Historian's Office,  desires an increase of his pay. He  now receives for his services $2.50 per  day, which is about $65.00 per  month.    He is a steady and trustworthy  clerk, and has worked in the Histo-  rian's Office seven years. He has  assisted to emigrate members of his  family from Great Britain, and   has been struggling to secure him-  self a home in the city. He  manifests a good degree of faith-  fulness and efficiency.    In view of the foregoing 
 we unite in respectfully recom-  mending that his pay be increased  to seventy five dollars per month.    Your brethren in the Gospel,    F. D. Richards,  John Jaques. 
 S L City  July 12, 1895    To Presidents Wilford Woodruff, Geo. Q. Cannon, & Joseph F. Smith    Dear Brethren—In accordance with your appoint-  ment of May 6, of Elders F. D. Richards, Moses Thatcher,   Seymour B. Young, and J. Jaques (the last named  appointed in place of L. J. Nuttall, absent) to consider  a number of cases appealed from various Stake High  Councils, we would respectfully report that, owing to ill  health, Elder Thatcher could not sit in committee to  consider all the cases, but, according to your later  appointment, Bishop R. T. Burton succeeded him,   and sat in committee on and after June 21. We   have carefully considered and reported to you on all the  twelve cases referred to us, and have sent you our findings  and recommendations upon them, with the respective  documents appertaining. Having therefore con-  cluded the work that you set us to do, we hope and  trust that our labors will prove satisfactory to you.    Respectfully your Brethren in the Gospel,    F. D. Richards.    on behalf of the Committee. 
 President Wilford Woodruff  S L City  June 14, 1889    My Dear Sir,    I have the pleasure to report that  the work of translating the Book of Mormon into  the Jewish language, which was commenced by  brother Edward Isaacson on or about the 4th of   May 1888, is now stated by him to be complete. He  delivered to me the last sheets on Saturday the 8th  of this month, and said it was as well and correctly  done as he was capable of doing it considering his limited  acquaintance with the English language.    To make the best of this work possible within my  power, Brother Morris Behrman has assisted me to  revise the work by reading the translation to me in  English, by which means we were enabled to make fre-  quent corrections, but I think the work must have  a much more careful and thorough revision than  we are capable of giving it before I could consent to  its publication    The translation occupies a thousand pages of  knickerbocker tablet paper and has the appearance  of being tolerably well written.    The amount paid br Edward Isaacson for 
 translating the work is eight hundred and fifteen  dollars ($815 00/100). That paid to brother Morris Behrman  for assisting in the revision of it is five hundred  and ninety ($590 00/100) dollars.    Respectfully submitted with the earnest hope  that it may not be long till we can see our way clear  to have this work published and sent abroad unto all  the House of Israel.    Yours in the Gospel    F. D. Richards. 
 S. L. City, U. T.    Prest. Wilford Woodruff  July 17, 1889    Presidents Office Salt Lake City    Dear Brother. Sometime last October Brother  Moses Peterson who was living at Moab, Emery  County in this Territory informed me that a  short line previous he had fallen in company  with a stranger who was traveling through the  Territory, and who in conversation informed him  that on a previous occasion as he was passing  through with a team (if I recollect right) he found  by the way side a Record Book containing various  matters of what might be of interest only to the  one who had lost it & stating ^also^ that the names  of several of our leading men were contained in  it.    Brother Peterson further stated that this man  offered to return the Record if he knew who to  return it to and gave Br. P. his name & address  which is "N. S. Batcheller. Freedom, Lasalle Co Ills."    On the 15th of last October I addressed a note to Mr  Batcheller as above permitting him to send it to this  address & offering to pay the necessary expressage but  have received no reply. Most truly F. D. Richards. 
 President Woodruff. S L City  March 21st 1889.  and Council—    Beloved Brethren—I think I ought to inform  you of our progress in the translation and revision  of the Book of Mormon into the Jewish Language.    Last Saturday—the 16th inst—brother Isaacson  handed in anstalment of the translation that  extended to page 459 of the last English Edition, which  leaves 164 pages to complete the translation. He says  he will have it finished by the last of April, as  he does quite regularly four pages each day.    Concerning the Revision—Brother Behrman & I  are pursuing this part of the labor, by his reading the  translation back to me in English thus noting and  corre[c]ting all apparent defects to the best of our ability, &  expect to have our part accomplished about the same  time as the translation will be.    Although we are doing the best we can at this, still  I am desirous that some more competent test should  be applied than we are able to give it.    In this connexion I would ask—Is it not time  to consider the necessary arrangements preparatory  to the printing and publishing of this work, which, 
 on account of it being in another language  may require time to order the necessary type,  paper, &.c. and this may be attended with  delay—    In view of all the circumstances I deem  it deem it important to present the condition  of the work before you in time to provide  for a further revision if advisable and to  prevent unnecessary delay in procuring the  material for its publication.    Respectfully submitted,    F. D. Richards. 
 HISTORIAN'S OFFICE, Salt Lake City, Feb. 20, 1896.    To President Wilford Woodruff and Counsellors.    Dear Brethren:    In accordance with your instructions we have considered   sister Sorenson's Manuscript on "What Women should Know".    We have not undertaken to correct errors of spelling, punctuation,   grammar or idioms, or the arrangement of sentences and paragraphs, as   we have not supposed that to be required of us.    There are many good things in the work, useful for married people   to know. We regard it as a work for professional medical and surgical  men and women, midwives and nurses, and for married people, and not  for lying around loose on the table, accessible to boys and girls, and   therefore not appropriate for the most general circulation and perusal,  as it contains specific details concerning procreation and parturition,  with minute descriptions and measurements of woman's genital organs,  and ^their^ environments.    Although apparently a midwife and nurse of considerable experience,   yet the author talks with the ardor and somewhat of the dogmatism of  a new and zealous convert, and is rather strict and rigid, indeed with  a tendency toward radical extremes in the advocacy of the views of her 
 new and special school of the healing doctrine, art and practice,  regarding food and abstention, dis[4 illegible letters]^car^ding tonics and stimulants  and almost all medicines, and relying on water treatment, massage,   and the healing forces of nature almost entirely, but including   faith and priestly administration.    Of course many nurses, midwives, medical and surgical^,^ and   other people of age and experience, will not accept her exclusive  doctrines and practice, at least not fully. Therefore we consider  that such a professional treatise and text-book, designed to be   urged upon the sisters very generally as of undoubted authority,  should, before publication or printing, be submitted to a competent  committee of men and women in the medical and surgical professions  and business, in order that the book, when published, may not be   one-sided, and may have greater weight with the people whom its   contents so much concern, and greater claim on the patronage of   those who will be expected to purchase and use it.    We remain,    Very respectfully your brethren in the Gospel,    F. D. Richards,  John Jaques  A. milton Musser 
 Salt Lake City, June 25, 1895.    To Presidents Wilford Woodruff, Geo. Q. Cannon,  and Joseph F. Smith.    Dear Brethren -- In the case of James  Polson and Christian A. Christensen, the latter charged  with removing and taking possession of 130 rods of fence  belonging to the former, in August 1892, we are unable  to affirm ^recommend the affirmation of^ the decision of the High Council of Bannock  Stake, or of the Bishop's Court of Basalt Ward. Whether  or not Brother Christensen (with his son, then under age)  did wrong in removing the fence depends upon whether  he or Brother Polson owned the land, and where the  proper boundary line ran, which latter questions  were not of a kind to be settled by Church Councils,  but by competent legal authority. The records before  us do not show these questions satisfactorily.    Brother Christensen objected to the juris-diction of the  Church courts on questions of land titles and bounda-  ries.  We have no minutes of the proceedings of  the High Council, excepting their decision affirming  the decision of the Bishops Court, to the effect that  Brother Christensen replace the fence in as good  condition as before, by July 1, 1894, or be disfellowshipped.  We do not know on what the High Council based  their decision, other than the minutes of the  Bishop's court.  Brother Christensen was not in  attendance, being at Smithfield. If the fence  as on Brother Christensen's land, he had a right to 
 remove it, but not to appropriate it. If it was on  Brother Polson's land, or on the dividing line, then  Brother Christensen had no right either to remove  or appropriate i the fence, and should make restitution,  if he has not done so.  We therefore recommend that the  case be referred again to the High Council of the Bannock   Stake, and that it would ^be well^ for a committee of arbitration  to consider the matter, especially with reference to the actual  legal ownership of the land on which the fence stood, and  the location of the boundary line or lines thereof, those  questions being the basis ^for the settlement^ of the whole case.    Respectfully Your Brethren in the Gospel,    F. D. Richards.  R T Burton  Seymour B Young  John Jaques. 
 S L City, February 13th 1890    Presidents Wilford Woodruff, Geo. Q. Cannon,   and Joseph F. Smith.    Dear Brethren    Your esteemed communication,   inclosing one from Brother Andrew  Jensen, would have been answered some  time ago, had not illness prevented a   due consideration of the subject, which we  have carefully and prayerfully canvassed.    There is, in Bro. Jensen's "Historical  Record," a large amount of valuable  historical information, and we think  he is entitled to much credit for his  work on the same.    He now offers to turn over, as a free gift  to the Church, his "Historical Record," subscrip-  tion list, good will of the concern, &c.,  with certain historical manuscripts  which he has written.    So far as this donation proffered is  concerned, abstractly considered, it is an  act of generosity. 
 But to this proposition another is at-  tached, which is that he be taken into the  employ of the Historian's Office, and this  latter proposition, in its various bearings,  has caused the most anxious thought.    He manifests great desire to push  himself into the office. It appears to  us to be a decided case of the man seeking  the office, which is not the best of recom-  mendations.    He offers to work either with or without  pay, but in fact he by no means expects  to work without material compensation.   He himself says he considers he is worthy  of his hire. We understand that he  would expect compensation, which  of course would be a reasonable expecta-  tion, if he was employed in the Historian's  Office. This part of his offer leads us  to think that he has an ax to grind.    He offers to work either in the office  or to travel. In conversation, however,   at various times, he has repeatedly said  that he does not want to sit in the  office and work regularly day after day, 
 President Wilford Woodruff  S L City  March 16, 18890    Dear Brother-    Bishop [Pleasant Green Taylor|P. G. Taylor of the Hanisville  Ward of Weber Stake, informs me that several mem-  bers of his ward, among others five of his sons, have en-  tered lands in Idaho, previous however to the late  decision of the U. S. Supreme Court declaring the Idaho  test oath constitutional.    With this new feature added to their political  status the Bishop desires to know how to advise these  people of his ward. He says they, and espectially his  sons, will not allow their names to be erased from the  church record in order to prove up their claims, that  they will relinquish their claims to the land rather  than jeopardize their standing or place themselves  in any doubtful position in their relations to the church.    The answer to Bp. Taylor's question is not only  applicable to his people, but it becomes a matter of such  general importance that I do not feel prepared to answer  it myself, but think it should be decided by the First   Presidency for the benefit of all those who are similarly situated.    Your early answer to this will be highly appreciated  as quite a number are waiting to act in accordance 
 with your conclusion.    Brother Taylor also desires your instruction in  the following case that exists in his ward:    A widow -- Sister Keyes -- whose husband died  about a year and a half ago, has five living children  and one dead by this man. Although they were  sealed in the Endowment House because she refused  to be married in any other way, it was not long till  he declared his utter unbelief in the ordinances they  had received together, forbade her and the children to  attend meetings, became exceedingly profane, cursed  God and the ordinances and his wife for correcting the  children, refused to pay tithing or to aid the poor in  any way notwithstanding he was labored with in  patience and longsuffering. He had no faith in a   hereafter or that he could have his wife and children  in a life to come.    Since his husband's death this Sister and her   children attend meetings and Sunday schools, and  Bp Taylor says she has been always a faithful and  exemplary woman, and she wishes to be released from  her deceased husband with liberty to be united to some  righteous man according to the order of the Gospel, and  he thinks she ought to have that privilege.    Very truly your brethren in the Gospel    F. D. Richards. 
 Sept. 19th 94.    Presidents Woodruff, Cannon & Smith.    Dear Brethren -    In compliance with your  request to me to furnish a state-  ment of the present status of the  Silk Industry in Utah I immedi-  ately sent letters of inquiry to several  of the Stake Presidents mostly interested  in this work & the following is the  res^u^lt of those inquiries the latest of  which came to hand this morning.    It is hoped that what is herein  contained may from sufficient to  enable you to form a judgement  as to the best course to pursue  concerning Sericulture in Utah.    Respectfully submitted    F. D. Richards.    15 pages of type writing. 
 Salt Lake City, Feburary 19, 1895.    Presidents Wilford Woodruff, Geo. Q. Cannon and Jos. F. Smith.    Dear Brethren:    Your Committee, to whom you referred the consideration  of Elder B. H. Roberts' new work entitled, "A New Witness For God",  respectfully represent that they have read it with great care, and be-  lieve it to be a valuable addition to our Church literature. They  find nothing therein calling for adverse criticism, but to the contrary  there is harmony in its chapters, which gives much strength to its  arguments, all of which point directly to the evidences, first, of the  need of a new witness for God, and next, that Joseph, the Priophet, was  that witness. The truths are emphasized on lines of reasoning, dif-  ferent from those common to our Elders, which carries to the work a   freshness and an interest that will, we think, attract students, and  develop oin our youth and others an increased love for the study of the  great latter-day work. Brother Roberts' work collates and condenses  a large amount of useful and important information, historical and  theological, which is often not readily accessa^i^ble to the Elders and  members of the church, but which tends to broaden their views and 
 enlarge and enlighten their understanding of various vital matters  connected with the Gospel of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.    We are also of the opinion that it would be a valuable work to  publish to the world at large, as setting forth and sustaining the  fundamental truths of the work of the Lord in this last dispensation.    Respectfully and affectionately,    Your Committee,    F. D. Richards.  John Jaques.  Geo. Reynolds    We have also read, revised and approved the Manuscript of Elder  F. F. Hintze, submitted at the same time as the Mss. of Elder Roberts.    F. D. R.  J. J.  G. R. 
 Salt Lake City, June 18, 1895    To President Wilford Woodruff, Geo. Q. Cannon,  and Joseph F. Smith.    Dear Brethren, Your committee  having carefully considered the case between  Thomas Broadbent and J. C. B. Jensen, heard  and determined by the Bishop's Court of the Elsinore  Ward, and subsequently by the High Council of the  Sevier Stake, have reached the conclusion that  the decision of the Bishop's Court, as later affirmed  by the High Council, is not justified by the evidence  of the record.    To our minds the conclusion  that there had been one definite understanding between  the brethren named as to the use of the roadway over  the land claimed by Brother Jensen is not war-  ranted by the evidence in the case, the testimony  showing clearly that a larger quantity of land be-  longing to Brother Thomas Broadbent had been  and is still used for waste water-way for the benefit  of Brother Jensen than that used for a roadway by  Brother Broadbent and belonging to Brother Jensen.  That such ditches were beneficially used by Brother  Broadbent himself in no way lessens, in our view,  the value accruing to Brother Jensen.    It is  clearly shown by the record that the roadway was  used previous to the acquirement of the land by  Brother Jensen, thus giving an acquired right  to those who used it. One of the witnesses advised, 
 the parties to settle without the payment of the  Five Dollars mentioned as the amount demanded  by Brother Jensen, and the payment of which was  refused by Brother Broadbent, saying that he thought,  in the use of the necessary lands for waste water-way,  that Brother Jensen had the best end of the bargain.  To us it appears singular that the High Council  should have recognized the importance and legal  bearings of necessary rights of way for water ditches  over public and private lands, and seemingly  ignored at the same time the claims of roads or  highways under similar conditions.    The letter of President Seegmiller to Brother Broad-  bent, conveying a warning, if not a covert threat, is a  remarkable exhibition of the lack of good judgment,  and shows, to our minds, a bias that would naturally  becloud his judgment, if not render it of doubtful  value.    By reason of these findings we are, in this case,  unable to recommend the affirmation of the  decision, but would recommend that Brother  Broadbent make the road on his own land, and  that Brother Jensen make the waste water ditches  on his land, provided that can be done without  serious loss to either party.    That adjustment,  in our view, would lead ultimately to the most sat-  isfactory results, and might remove a bone of  contention which if continued might seriously injure  both parties and possibly affect, more or less, the   general public in that stake of Zion. 
 If, however, that cannot be accomplished without se-  riously damaging both parties, or either of them,  we would recommend the free use of the existing  road by Brother Broadbent, and are equally free  use of the existing water ditches by Brother Jensen, the  use of the one kind being in full compensation for  the use of the other.  Five dollars being the amount  that prevented a full settlement heretofore, the charge  of $2000 as damages per year for the use of the road, seems  ridiculous to us.    We are not able to see that the decision, as rendered by the  Bishop's Court and affirmed by the High Council, eis at  all warranted by the testimony, but, on the contrary,  is arbitrary, and is in conflict with the testimony.  If settlement of this difficulty can be made on the basis  of the use of the road on exchange for the use of the ditches  conveying waste water, that will be in harmony  with and finally accomplish the recommenda-  tion of the teachers who so patiently labored on the  lines of justice and so persistently urged recon-  siliation.

 Papeete Tahiti  Sept 10/97  To the First Presidency   Salt Lake City, Utah  Dear Brethren -   We have been work-  ing on Tahiti for one month back.  The elders are making an effort to   work among the people without "purse  or script."  Thus far they have received   very kind treatment.  This course con't  be followed here very successfully so   long as the government does not  interfere and I apprehend ittle  trouble from that source so long  as we attend wisely to our duties.  So far as I am able to deter-  mine we are making a good   impression among the natives 
 Some are becoming quite inquisi-  tive and I trust that by the end of a   year we shall begin to make a record  among them, however, I feel that  we should not despair though we  do not receive immediate response   to our efforts.  I note that converts have   been made on the various islands where  the gospel has been taken and I con  no reason why this island should be  an exception.    There is arumor spreading very  rapidly in this part and at the  other islands of this mission that  Joeph Smith Jr. the president of  the Josephite Church will be here  in December and remain un-  til after April Conference.  While  I trust that it is only a rumor  I fear that the arrival of such a  person will make times lively 
 for us here.  I understand []  Mr. Burton the president of the mission  here is one of the most influential  members of the Josephite Church and  it may be possible that Mr. Smith  has yielded to his persuasion to come  here this being one of their strongest  missions.  They have appointed  their April conferene to be held at  our strongest branch.  Takaroa.  We  are quite anxious to get our build-  ing completed there by that time.  If you consider it wise we should  be pleased to have a person some-  what handy with carpenter tools and  can do some plastering as one of four  coming this fall.    The elders in general are progress 
 ing well with the language.    I have talked with Maputu  and he thinks that the natives are  ready to subscibe for copies of the  Book of Mormon and Doctrine and  Covenants.  I feel quite confident   that from $13,000.00 to $14,000.00 Chilian  com can be raised in advance for   that purpose by giving the natives  receipts entitling them to a copy  when published.  The time is fully  ripe to have these books among them  if you intend that they should have  them.  I have allotted the work of  translation between Elders Chamb-  lin, Willey and myself.  We have  access to a translation of the French   Tahitian grammar and vocabulary  and believe with this assistance we  can make a very correct trans-  lation.   
 he does not want to be in the office much, but  he wants to have a desk here, so he can  have free run of the papers and documents  in the office, but he would like most of the  time to travel about the country, in and  through the various stakes and wards, to  collect historical information, with a view  to its publication in his "Historical Record,"  or other works. Knowing this to be his  cherished ambition, which he seems to  think he was expressly born to realize;  the subject assumes another phase, and  a very important one.    Several questions here arise.    Would it be well for the Historian's  Office to assume to publish a periodical similar  to the "Historical Record"?    Would it be well for the Historian's   Office to employ and authorize Brother  Jensen to travel most of his time  around in the various stakes and  wards to collect historical data? 
 He is manifestly a man of ambition,  who would make much of his authority  and position, and would not be backward   in presuming considerably on the same.  He would require his regular compensation,  and probably in addition would want to be   entertained and helped along as a person of   some importance and authority, as a   sort of Historian's Office missionary; would   expect R.R. passes, travelling expenses,   recommendations to presidents of stakes,  bishops, or other prominent persons in stakes   or wards, or a sort of virtual carte blanche  to ask local aid in his labors. Whether   it would be advisable to establish such a func  tionary, as an appendage to the Historian's   Office, is a serious question, at least unde[r]   the present peculiar circumstances.    The chief complaint in the case of   Milando Pratt was that he liked to be   away from the office, except when it   suited him to be here. He was so irregular   in his attendance that the office could   seldom rely on his coming to work at   any regular time, no matter how much 
 he might be needed, the habit being a growing   one and probably resulting from having   been employed at one time in copying   at so much per hundred words, and regular   hours not being so necessary at that kind   of work.    But it does not seem advisable to   continue, or rather to renew, such desulto-  ry and intermittant sort of labor in this   office, as it is not pleasant, being difficult   to keep track of, and it has a rather loose   and demoralizing influence on regularity   of attendance in other clerks.    There is another light in which Brother   Jensen's proposal may be considered. If the   offer of his magazine, manuscripts, &c., may   be regarded in the light of a bait, or bribe,   or purchase, or inducement of employ-  ment in the service of the Historian's Office,   and of his necessarily continued superin-  tendence and management of the   "Historical Record," or any publication 
 of the Historian's Office, then it may be con-  sidered bad policy and a bad precedent to   accept the offer and to employ Brother Jensen,   so as to furnish ground for a shadow of claim   to such obligation or lien on the office.    It would be bad policy for this office to   accept of any such offer from any man,   if there was coupled with it any obligation,  written or verbal, understood or implied,   that where the donation went the donor   must be also and necessarily continue   as a part of it, a tacitly recognized if not   essential part of it. Very unpleasant   it would be, if it was found desirable   at any time afterward, and on any   account, to dispense with his services,   as he then could and might go about   saying what great things he had done   for the office, how badly it had used him,  and how ungrateful it had been to him   for the sacrifice of his own private business   which he had made for it and to enter   its employ. All such things are possi-  ble where a man fails to realize his   ambitions. 
 As a regular clerk in the office, to work   steadily regular hours at any kind of work   that might come along, the same as other  clerks, it is doubtful if Brother Jensen   would be much of a success. He does   not want to do it if he can help it. That   is not his desire. His ambition reaches   forth in other directions, and consequent-  ly he would chafe and be ill-suited and   dissatisfied under the restriction of   steady daily clerk work, either routine,   or varied by anything that might come   along.    Furthermore, although he has   good qualifications for historical work,  yet he is such a persistent pusher of   himself and his projects that he soon   gets wearisome. He is the kind of man   who want to pry into the bottom of   everything, to know just what everybody   else in the office was doing, and would   look into and over their work to find out 
 a valuable qualification sometimes, but   at other times very inconvenient, and   apt to cause unpleasantness and disagree-  able friction. He had a seat in the   office for a few weeks some two or three years   ago, doing some work of his, so the office   has had a little experience in this way.    It is disagreeable to have to snub a man   who is too forward in trying to find out   what other people are doing and what   their immediate business is, though some-  times it is worse for him to see and know   everything that is going on and being done,   whether it concerns him or not.    He has long wanted to establish   himself where he can have frequent   and unrestricted interviews with the   authorities of the church, and a man  who is continually wanting and seeking   such occasions is likely to become tiresome   and troublesome, indeed something of   a bore.    He is not the kind of man that   we are anxious to employ as a clerk,  at the present time at least. If it was 
 desirable to employ another clerk in the   Historian's Office, one who is less presuming,  without such personal aspirations and   ambitions to push forward, and who   would be willing to do any sort of plain   work required any and every day, would   be much more suitable to the present   condition of things. He ought also to   be a fairly good penman, and it would   be well if he were a shorthand writer,  in both of which particulars we believe   Brother Jensen is lacking.    If the Church was in more favorable   circumstances, financially and otherwise  and the Historian's Office had a larger   staff of employes to work more freely and   especially on Church History proper, it might   have been well to employ Brother Jensen   as one of them, but it seems hardly   advisable under the present restricted   condition of things, as there are in the   office but few proper and scarcely any 
 documents to be used, and it is uncertain   how long these conditions will continue, or   the office will retain its present quarters,   or have a roof over it, or to what shifts it   will be put for a local habitation.  At   present little more than ordinary current   work can be done, the main object being   to take care of what we have and obtain   from time to time, and keep the old ship   off the breakers, if possible, while running   under bare poles in the storm, rather   than to be spreading out sail and   unnecessarily increasing work and   expenses.    The recent decision of the court of last   resort, sustaining as constitutional   the infamous Idaho test oath, opens the   way to the admittance of that territory as   a state into the Union with that oath   intact, which virtually disfranchised   every Latterday Saint in that territory or   State.    Further, if Idaho can go into the   Union with a constitutional plank of   that unjust, arrogant, and stringent 
 character, as the Senate Committee   recommends, Utah can be admitted   with a consitution having the same   disqualification, and thus disfranchise-  ment of Latterday Saints will be gene-  ral and may become universal. To   what indignities, expenses, and losses,  or into what straits the Church and   the people may then be put, is easier   to imagine than describe.    Then the election just had in this city   is likely to have results which will greatly   intensify and aggravate the unpleasant-  ness of the present condition of things.  Besides, if the election of Salt Lake City  can be determined by fraud, so can the   election of any other city in the territory,   and probably of some counties, at the   will of our enemies, and without   disfranchisement by law.  They have   now learned how to do these things   with facility, and apparently with im- 
 punity, for it seems useless to look to the   courts for prevention or redress, as with   our enemies it is partisan and persecu-  tive business from beginning to end.    Moreover the unfortunate and un-  expected leaning of the Supreme Court   of the United States in favor of pains   and penalties for opinions and for con-  science' sake, as manifested in the late   decision, renders it probable that any   week we may hear of the confiscation   of the property of the Church being sus  tained by the same court, which would   be likely to leave the Church in an ex-  tremely awkward situation.    Considering all these things, especially   the present and probable financial and   political conditions, we are more than   ever convinced that it would not be well   to accept Brother Jensen's proposition,   as it would require considerable branching  out into labors and expenditures at an   exceedingly inopportune time and [used]  peculiarly forbidding circumstances.  A competent, discreet, and trustworthy 
 clerk of all work, rather than a specialist,   is the best kind to have in the Historian's  Office now.    As Brother Jensen represents that he is   able to carry on his publication as a private   business, support his family, and pay his   bills at the "Deseret News" office, it seems to   us, that it would be well for him to con-  tinue to do so. If at any time the   Church should desire the use of any   historical information which he may   have gathered, it could probably be   had for a reasonable remuneration.    We have herein given our views on the   subject frankly and at large, looking   solely to the best interest of the office and   the Church, in the present condition of   things, at the same time not wishing   to detract in the least from the credit   due to Brother Jensen for the work he has  done. In some respects we regret 
 that we cannot return a more favorable   answer. But we have endeavored   to take a broad and just view of the   subject, bringing probabilities also   into account, as requested in your   letter.    Finally, whether you decide to   decline or accept Brother Jensen's   offer, we shall be happy to do all we   can to further your wishes.    We remain Your brethren in   the Gospel    F. D.

 Salt Lake City, August 12, 1896    To Presidents Wilford Woodruff, Geo. Q. Cannon and Jos. F. Smith.    Beloved Brethren in the Lord:-    In reply to your letter of June 19th,  1896, covering a Resolution of the High Council of Salt Lake Stake,  concerning which an action of the Apostles was desired, I desire to  state, that on Tuesday the 7th day of July, the Apostles were together  in Council (except Moses Thatcher, A. H. Lund and A. H. Cannon), and  had the Rsolution of the High Council under consideration.    After mature deliberation, it was moved by Elder Brigham Young  and seconded by Elder John H. Smith, and unanimously voted, that,  "This Council does not recognize the right of one of our number on  his own volition to go into any organized Stake of Zion, and abrogate  and set aside a standing regulation established by the President  of the Church, and endorsed by the High Council of that Stake".    Most respectfully,    _______________, President.    ________________Secretary.    (signature of F. D. Richards) 
 Salt Lake City, July 8, 1897.  To The First Presidency.  Dear Brethren:-  The Mss sent to the Historian's office prepared by Elder  E. H. Nye, Prsident of the California Mission, has been carefully  examined.  While it contains many good points on the first principles of the  Gospel, it appears to be too voluminous for popular use as a tract.  If the various subjects it treats of were presented under the separate  headings it contains, it would perhaps be better adapted for circu-  lation, but even in that case the matter would have to be re-written.  As there are now in print many tracts treating on the subjects con-  tained in the MSS, the necessity for publishing it does not appear  imperative.  In any event careful revision and much labor would be   required before it would be suitable for publication.  All of which   is respectfully submitted.    Your brother in the Gospel,   (signature of F. D Richards) 
 May 6 [18]98    To the First Presidency    Dear Brethren    We, you committee, appointed   to examine the papers in the appeal of   Brother Nathan Tanner Jr from a decision  of the High Council of the Weber Stake  of Zion, having very carefully and thorough-  ly examined and considered all the papers  in the case presented to us, hereby respect-  fully report as follows, to wit:    The decision of the High Council appears  to be fully justified by the evidence.    1st It is clear from the testimony, as well  as the statements of both the accuser and  accused, that Nathan Tanner Jr. owes and  should pay to Annie Pingree Tanner, his  divorced wife, the sum of $12500    2nd The second charge in the complaint  was properly dismissed, the amount of $20 00  claimed by the accuser having been   paid to her father 
 3rd the accused is under moral and re-  ligious obligation to provide a home and  support for his divorced wife and the three  children which are his, and that this may  be secured to them he should deed to Annie  Pingree Tanner, in trust for those three  children, the home they now occupy or  some equally suitable property, and fur-  nish them a milch cow with feed and  the sum of four dollars per week in money.  With the proviso that this may be modified  as decided by the High Council. The only  differences in these terms of the decision and  those admitted to be proper by the accused  are these: He thinks that $2 50 per week a  sufficient cash amount for a woman and  three children, and the Council decide that  $4 per week is the proper amount considering  the circumstances of all the parties. Also he  objects to deeding any property for the support  of his children, claiming that he wants the 
 place himself and is able and willing to  care for them; while the Council decide  that the children shall be secured in a  home under the care of their mother, and  in case of any change in the conditions,  requiring a change in the terms of the  decision, the matter shall be determined  by arbitration in the manner provided  by that decision. The other part of the  family of Brother Nathan Tanner Jr. have  been provided for, it appears, by the  property deeded to their mother    4 th As it is evident from the admissions  and explanations of Brother Nathan Tanner Jr  that he did obtain and furnish to his wife  Annie an instrument to prevent conception  and request her to use it for that purpose,  the requirement of the Council that he  ask her forgiveness for doing so seems  very proper and a merciful disposition  of the matter. 
 In reference to the doubt cast upon the pa-  ternity of one of the children by Bro. Nathan  Tanner Jr, the evidence does not bear out the  insinuation in any particular, but shows  that Bro. Tanner's effort to prevent further  conception, and the birth of the third child,  occurred after the alleged improper con-  duct of his wife Annie, and that he there-  fore condoned the offence if any there were    We find nothing in the papers submitted  to us which justifies the severe and violent  charges against Bishop R. McQuarrie  and Presidents C. F. Middleton and N.   C Flygare, who appear to have endeavored  to deal out justice tempered with mercy  in their investigations and decisions    We unanimously recommend that the  decision of the High Council of the  Weber Stake of Zion in this case be  sustained in every particular    We herewith return the papers submitted  to us, and subscribe ourselves    Your brethren &c    F.

 137    Salt Lake City, Sept. 1, 1896.    President Wilford Woodruff and Counselors Geo. Q. Cannon and Joseph  F. Smith.    Dear Brethren:-    About the time that Elder Alonzo E. Hyde departed for Europe,   he called at my office, informed me of his intended departure, and  stated that it had been his habit while previously in London to attend  meetings and speak, and had administered baptism, and he desired to   do what good he could while away. He said it had been suggested that  he call at the President's office, but they had all left for the night,   and that he must go that night, or by the early forning train, and   wanted to get the letter now; said he had been recommended by Brother   Smith to do so. (I understood him to mean President Jos. F. Smith).   I then asked him for his recommend from his Bishop. He replied, "I  am a Bishop's Counselor, and have a right to sign recommends in the  absence of the Bishop, myself". I thereupon issued a regular letter  of appointment to him as a missionary, bearing date of that day,    as ever,    Your fellow laborer in Zion,    F.D. Richards. 
 56    Historian's Office, Salt Lake City, June   , 1896.    Presidents Wilford Woodruff, George Q. Cannon and Joseph F. Smith.  Beloved Brethren in the Lord:-    It is with great reluctance that I   feel constrained to ask you for assistance to enable me to dischare  my obligations financially, which have been accumulating upon me for  a number of years past, during the rail and hard times that attended  and followed thereupon.    This indebtedness, which now amounts to $575000./ has not accrued  through any misadventure of speculation or trade, but has come about  by the continuous necessary expenses of myself and the dependant por-  tions of my families. I have not expended one dollar in mining, nor  have I received a dollar from any mining interest.    During the period while Government was plundering the Church, I  felt to bear my own burden, as all around me seemed to have all they  could carry, and I have patiently hoped against hope, until by the good  providence of God, the Government has restored, and agreed to restore,  all Church property, real and personal, to its rightful possessor.    I was gratified that it was deemed advisable to relieve my breth-  ren of the Cannon and Grant Company, and I hope it may be found per-  missable to afford me the relief which I now ask, and very much need,  to enable me to stop paying interest, and deliver me from financial 
 57    -:2:-    embarrassment, so that I may preserve my credit and pursue my labors  with a pleasure and delight, which I cannot otherwise do.    My Bishop credits me with paying a full tithing; and my full  quoto of offering to finish the Temple.  I have donated fairly to the  Stake Academy, the Tabernacle, our new Second Ward Hall, Feat-day  offerings, besides many others for the poor.    Meanwhile I have observed as rigid economy in my personal and  family expenditures as I thought consistent with my station in life.    If not too tedious, I might allude to the fact that in the midst  of my life, while I had the care of Dr. Willard Richards', as well as  my own large families, I had years of distressing sickness to contend  with.  The loss of what little I had by Indians in the Tintic War, which  with the duties of the ministry, prevented me from establishing myself  in business as some of my brethren have been able to do, and today I have neither Farm, Flock, Herd, or any permanent business from which  to derive any regular income.  But now that my family have become able,  most of them, to help themselves, I trust that with the aid herein ask-  ed, I may keep my expenses within the available income at present  allowed.    While I wish to give all needed information of my circumstances,  I desire no needless publicity of them, and shall feel exceedingly  thankful for the assistance herein asked.    If I may receive one half of the amount named soon, and the other   in three months, I believe I shall be able to satisfy the most urgent of  my creditors- Yours Faithfully F. D. Richards. 
 Papeete, Tahiti, Dec. 11, 1896  To the First Presidency,  Salt Lake City, Utah  Dear Brethren,    Since my last  to you I have made a tour a-  round Tahiti on foot stopping at most of the places  on the way.  My purpose in making the tramp was   to gain experience in using the language and especially to  make my self acquainted with the people and the general features  of this, the principal island in the mission.  I feel well paid   for my effort.  I found the people as a whole[ very] kind  I was treated to the best they had.  At many places the poul-  try yard suffered a loss in my behalf and the best bed in the  house was always placed at my disposal.  They have all the   faults and failings common to their race, but I was

If the author of the work were a student of some modern  sectarian Theological Seminary, its contents would not, perhaps, ex-  cite much comment.    The work is scholarly and exhaustive; but while the author in-  sists that his arguments are in strict harmony with quotations on the  subject of preaching and how to preach the Gospel, taken from standard  sources, the Mss. in its explicit and general tenor inculcates theories  and urges upon its readers suggestions, propositions and methods al-  together at variance with the plain intent and meaning of those  standards. Nevertheless it contains a number of wholesome and  seasonable suggestions, well worthy the consideration of thoughtful and  prayerful Elders.  Yet, after all, there is nothing in the teachings  of the Savior and his Apostles, ancient or modern, in support of the   methods and disipline urged by the author.    After a careful review of the Mss, we are of the opinion that it  would not be a suitable work to publish as a guide to preaching, for  the Elders of the church, who are commended to speak that which is  given them by the spirit, when it becomes their duty to preach and teach.

 115    Salt Lake City, August 7, 1896.    To The First Presidency:-  Dear Brethren:-    The propositions of L. A. Wilson in reference to the  recording of genealogies and work performed by individuals in behalf  of the dead, have been duly considered by the Church Historian and his  assistants and by a majority of the Directors of the Genealogical  Society, and their unanimous decision is, that it is inexpedient to  entrust a work of such magnitude and importance as that proposed, to  one person or to any private agency, Nor does it appear from the docu-  ments submitted that the evils complained of would be remedied by the   scheme proposed.  It would seem more in keeping with the order of the  Church and of Temple Work to place this matter under the supervision  of the Temple Recorders and Presidents.    Very respectfully,    F. D. Richards-    Church Historian, and President of the Genealogical Society of Utah 
 306    Historian's Office, Salt Lake City, Sept. 1, 1897.    To the First Presidency,  Dear Brethren:-    Having read and scrutinized the Ms. of a work   entitled "Children of God", by Brother Nephi Anderson, of Brigham  City, according to your request, we beg to report as follows:    We find no special objection to the story or to the doc-  trinal points with which it treats; the style of the work exhi-  bits much taste and literary ability, and the descriptive matter  is striking and attractive.  Yet we would not recommend the en-  dorsement of the authorities of the Church in its publication,  as that would make the Church, to some extent at least, responsible  for its theories, and might be used to urge the sale of the book  in a way that would not be desirable.  We are of the opinion that  permission might be given to the author to publish the work on his  own responsibility, without the seal of sanction from the Church  authorities.  We see no harm that could come from its publication  in that way, but concede that it might do considerable good.    Respectfully, your brethren,    F. D. Richards.  J Jaques.  C. W. Penrose  A Milton Musser 
 Salt Lake City, December 24, 1895.    Presidents Wilford Woodruff, George Q. Cannon and Joseph F. Smith.  Dear Brethren:-    According to your instructions, we have carefully read   and considered the Manuscript by Elder Samuel G. Spencer, and hereby  respectfully report, that while it is lengthy for a pamphlet designed  for general circulation, making probably about fifty pages of ordinary  size, it is yet a fair epitome of the doctrines and organization of  the Church, with the history of the coming forth of the Book of Mormon  and the Scriptural predictions concerning it, all fortified by very  numerous quotations from the Old and New Testaments, and likely to be  productive of good, by meeting objections raised against the latter  day work.  If it is published, it should be carefully revised for the  press, additional sub-headings interpolated, and some expressions modi-  fied.    In going over the Manuscript, some suggestions of this kind we  have marked upon it.  The writer has borrowed copiously in the latter  part of the work from the writings of Orson Pratt, but they are made to  harmonize with the other parts of the work.    We do not think it would be advisable for the Church to issue the 
 :-2:-    pamphlet as one of its Standards, but if the Northern States Mission  were to print it, no doubt it would be of value as an aid to missionary  labors.    Respectfully your brethren,    F. D. Richards-  J. Jaques  C. W. Penrose  A Milton Musser 
 123    Salt Lake City, AUg. 8, 1898.    President Wilford Woodruff and Counsellors.  Dear Brethren:-    In accordance with your wishes, I have heard Elder  L. Wilson's Sketch of the Life of David W. Patten read, in company with  Elders J. Jaques, C. W. Penrose, and A. M. Musser, and we all consider  it is an excellent work, and will prove interesting, instructive and  edifying to its readers.    We would, however, make the following suggestions, which we think   would be improvements:    Page 4,- "New Movement".  Would not some other expression be  better?    Page 8,- "Patriarch Joseph C. Kingsbury".  He was not a Patriarch   then.  Would not the word Elder be better, if any title is given:    Page 9,- "Sent to the honest in heart".  Was he not sent to  Preach the Gospel to all who would hear?    Page 10.- "Patriarch Hyrum Smith".  Same as page 8.    Page 11,- "President B. Young".  Same as page 8.    Page 24,- "President Lorenzo Snow".  Same as page 8.    Page 24,- "Master passion".  What was that?  Is it a good  expression? 
 124    -:2:-    Page 25,- "Presidents".  Same as page 8.    Page 27,- "President Smoot".  Same as page 8.    Page 28,- Smoot's letter on the appearance of Cain.  Would the   publication of that visitation be productive of good?  We doubt it.    Page 31,- "President",  Same as page 8.    Page 32,- "President W. W.".  Same as page 8.    Page 32,-  "  "   "  "  "  "    Page 34,- This passage seems to need modifying; seems to be too  much strained for effect.    Page 37,- "President W.".  Same as page 8.    Page 39,- "Andrew Jenson, the historian". Would it not be  better to say history records?    Trusting our labors will be satisfactory to you, we remain,    Your brethren in the Gospel,    F. D. Richards.  J. Jaques  C. W. Penrose  A Milton Musser 
 Salt Lake City. June 10, 1895.    To Presidents Wilford Woodruff,  Geo. Q. Cannon, and Joseph F. Smith.    Dear Brethren-    Having considered the case of Jane  Diamond and George Fraxer, or Richfield,  appealed from Sevier Stake High Council,  we would respectfully report that we conclude  that the decision of the High Council was in  accordance with the preponderance of the testi-  mony taken and that the ends of justice ap-  parently have been reached; also that the ques-  tion involved being only of a few dollars, and  twelve years having elapsed since the High Council  decision was given, and the president of the  Council having passed away and some of  the members having been changed, it  would be unprofitable to reopen the case.    Therefore your committee unanimously  recommend that the decision of the High  Council be affirmed and enforced.    F. D. Richards.  Moses Thatcher  Seymour B Young  John Jaques 
 S L City  June 11, 1895    To Presidents Wilford Woodruff, Geo. Q. Cannon,  and Joseph F. Smith.    Dear Brethren - In the case of Elizabeth  Foxall Palmer and James Palmer, of Grantsville,  on appeal from Tooele Stake High Council, we find  it difficult to come to a satisfactory conclusion,  unless we have an idea of the approximate amount  of property which Brother Palmer has.    We therefore respectfully suggest that you have  President Hugh S. Gowans, of Tooele City, written  to, asking him for a list of the property Brother  Palmer holds, real and personal, so far as it  can be ascertained with reasonable effort.  We  should also like to know the respective ages of  Brother Palmer's children by his several wives, in  order that we may be the better enabled to render   a just judgment in the case.    Respectfully your brethren in the Gospel    F. D. Richards.  Moses Thatcher  Seymour B Young  John Jaques 
 Salt Lake City, June 11th, 1895.    To Presidents Wilford Woodruff, Geo. Q. Cannon, and  Joseph F. Smith.    Dear Brethren, In the case of Hannah S.  Olsen and Catharine Lewis, of Logan, on appeal from  the Cache Stake High Council, we find that the evidence  presented appears to us to justify the decision of the Council.  Although Sister Olsen claimed that she was willing to  give a mortgage on the property in question as soon as  she received the abstract, yet she still refused, even when  her own attorney advised her to give it. We therefore  respectfully recommend that the decision of the High   Council be affirmed.    We notice in passing that in the hearing of this case  only five members of the High Council proper were  present, whereas the Book of Covenants states that seven  should be present. But, as neither of the parties  before the Council in this case took any exceptions or  objected to these facts, our remarks in this connec-  tion have a bearing more upon future cases.    We remain    Your brethren, & c.    F. D. Richards  Moses Thatcher  Seymour B Young  John Jaques 
 Salt Lake City, July 11, 1895.    Presidents Wilford Woodruff, Geo. Q. Cannon, and Joseph F. Smith.    Dear Brethren, Your Committee have carefully considered the docu-  ments presented in the case of Brothers Silas S. Smith and J. P. Haynie,  appealed from the High Council of San Luis Stake. It appears that  several years ago Silas S. Smith, as a silent and equal partner, put  $1000 into the store of Downey and Haynie, of Manassa, the said  Downey and Haynie having previously invested an equal amount  cash therein. The store proved to be not a success, said to be largely  owing to giving too much credit, and S. S. Smith wanted his $1000 back  with interest, the other two partners, Downey and Haynie, having drawn  amounts from the stores equal to their shares in it, and Smith not  having drawn anything. The case, by agreement, went before three  arbitrators, and also before the High Council, which accepted and  adopted the decision of the arbitrators, which decision, as we understand  it, was, briefly, That the total amount due S. S. Smith should be held at  $1,600, with six per cent per annum interest from date of decision until  paid, the whole to be paid out of the assets of the Company, and not  out of the personal or private property of either Haynie or Downey, and  that J.P. Haynie be placed in possession of said company's property for  the payment of said obligation. This appears to us to be an  equitable decision, and we therefore respectfully recommend the  affirmation of the decision of the High Council, with the under-  standing of it as here presented.    Your Brethren in the Gospel,    F. D. Richards.  R J Burton  Seymour B Young  John Jaques 
 pleased to note that they seemed ready to listen to my  remarks on our gospel and appeared to take interest in  the same but my knowlede of the language was not suf-  ficient to do any real work in this line.  They [claimed]  that we did not stay long enough with them for  them to get acquainted with us and therefore we must   not expect them to be taking up with our views.  I  think this quite true.  I understand from Bro. Cutler  that this reason in writing the tract just published was to  be able to begin real work here.  From what I gather of   the condition of the people throughout the islands I be-  leive the tract system will be the most successful and think  Bro. Cutler made a step in the right direction when he  wrote his tract.  I beleive there are openings to get the gospel  [] in people on this and think to begin with four    
 elders could be [used] to advantage here.  This would   allow two elders on each side of the island.  I shall be   pleased to receive four elders in addition to those al-  ready asked for as early as it will be convenient to get   them here.  Tahiti has a population of 10 .113, it is 91 kilo-  metres or 114 miles in cirumference.  The City of Papeete a-  lone contains 4.288 leaving 5.825 scattered over the rest  of the island.  With the exception of about 30 miles there is  a good road.  This thirty miles is almost impassable and to   reach places there one would need to use boats.    Perhaps the following statement will be of[ insight] to you.  Tahiti has a population of 10 113 and we might [] not   been worked.  It is true elders have been on Tahiti and most   of them I am informed have visited most of the island  but it was before they understood the language, as soon  as they were able to use the language and in most cases be 
 fore that time, they were sent to the Tuamotus or Tubuai  Bro. Cutler made an effort but or he was not allowed to use   the churches here to speak in he made no further effort in that   line but published the tract referred to with the intention of reach-  ing the people that way but he returned home by the [] that  brought the tracts.  Moorea has a population of 1407.  No work has   been done there.  The Marquises Group have a population of 4.445 (by  some authorities 7.500)  No work has been done there.  The Gambier  Group 508.  No work done.  The Leeward Group about 6.000 no work done  Cook Islands 8.000 (per []), no work done.  Rimatara 550,   no work done.  Rurutu 730, one saint, 185 days work, Tubuai  429, 159 saints, well worked.  Tuamotus 4,743.  905 saints  well worked.  Just over one fifth of these last two islands  are "Mormons".  This shows a population of 35,380 or if   [] greater population of Marquises in taken 28,435.  Of* 
 To President W. Woodruff,  S L City, June 3, 1895.  Geo. Q. Cannon, & Jos. F. Smith.    Dear Brethren - your committee, to whom you referred   certain applealed cases from Stake High Councils, for exam-  ination and findings, respectfully report the following on   the case between the Bishopric of Farmington and Brother   T.B. Clark.    The record submitted shows that Brother Clark has been   disposed, and has made it his practice, to defame the   reputation of his brethren, and when urged to make   specific charges against those whom he has accused of   various crimes has persistently refused to do so, yet has not   discontinued his slanderous remarks, but has found   fault with the Bishopric for not trying those against   whom he will neither make direct charges nor testify.    While accusing others, his letters, written over an assumed   name, clearly show, in our opinion, the duplicity to which he   descended in his efforts to injure the local authorities of the Farmington Ward.    In view of these findings, we respectfully recommend that the decision   of the Stake High Council be affirmed, and that instructions   be given to have the same enforced.    F. D. Richards  Moses Thatcher   Seymour B. Young  John Jaques. 
 164  Salt Lake City, June 25, 1895.  Presidents Wilford Woodruff, Geo Q. Cannon, and Joseph   F. Smith.    Dear Brethren - In the case of Charles G. Parkinson   against Bishop James Wrathall, appealed from the High   Council of the Tooele Stake, it appears that Brothers Parkin-  son and Wrathall and others had sheep in a joint herd,   which diminished and eventually was broken up, partly   from neglect of the herdsman.  Brother Wrathall went   to the herd, claimed and sold the sheep, appropriating   them all as his share and then they were insufficient to   fully satisfy his claim.  On Brother Parkinson's complaint   the case was tried by Bishop Atkin of the Tooele Ward.  Brother Wrathall appealed from the decision of the Bishop's   court to the High Council of Tooele Stake, which heard the   case, and President H. L. Gowans decided that Brother   Parkinson was entitled to his prorata of the number of   sheep when sold, amounting to 95, and that as   Brother Wrathall had looked after the sheep and effected   the sale of them no interest on their value from the time of   sale should be required of him.  This decision was not   sustained by the ^High^ Councillors, the vote being 6 and 6.  The High Council reheard the case and decided that Bro-  ther Wrathall pay Brother Parkinson 74 sheep at $200 per  head, without interest, to be delivered in 90 days at Grants-  ville.  Brother Parkinson thought he ought to have   more sheep, and rental or interest on their value from   the time of sale.  As no evidence appears to have 
 2  been taken at the rehearing by the High Council, we do not see   on what grounds the Council reduced the number of sheep   to be paid from 95 to 74, nor why they came to render a   decision differing from that made at the first hearing.  On the   contrary, it seems to us that President Gowan's decision   at the first sitting of the High Council should be accepted,   in accordance with Doc. & Cov., Sec. 102, pars. 21&22.  As   that decision appears to us to have been an equitable one,   we recommend that it be affirmed.    Respectfully your Brethren in the Gospel,  F. D. Richards   R T Burton  Seymour B Young  John Jaques 
 Salt Lake City, June 25, 1895.  To Presidents Wilford Woodruff, Geo. Q. Cannon, and   Joseph F. Smith.    Dear Brethren - In the case of Bishop Joseph E. Thorn   and Samuel Green, sen., against Elijah Mayhew and Sarah   Mayhew, of Pleasant Grove, for slander, on appeal from   the High Council of Utah Stake, Brother and Sister Mayhew   are charged with circulating a statement that Brothers Thorn   and Green deposited a load of wheat in the Pleasant Grove   Tithing Office about 15 years ago, and the same hour, in the   absence of Brother Mayhew, who was the Tithing Office clerk, taking   the wheat out of the office and carrying it away again, which,   though not impossible, was a very unlikely thing, and was   denied by Brothers Thorn and Green.    The case was heard by Bishop George Halliday, of American Fork, who decided that the   charge was established, there being lack of evidence of the alleged  theft, and that Brother and Sister Mayhew ask forgiveness of Bros.   Thorn and Green, or be disfellowshipped.    Brother and   Sister Mayhew appealed to the Utah Stake, which sus-  tained the decision of the lower court.    As Brother and Sister   Mayhew failed to furnish satisfactory proof of their damaging   statements concerning Brothers Thorn & Green, and consequently   were in the wrong in circulating such statements, we therefore   can come to no other conclusion than to affirm the decision   of the High Council, which we respectfully recommend.    Respectfully, Your Brethren in the Gospe,  F. D. Richards.  R T Burton  Seymour B Young  John Jaques 
 Salt Lake City, June 26, 1895.  To Presidents Wilford Woodruff, Geo. Q. Cannon, and   Joseph F. Smith.    Dear Brethren - Your committee herewith return  the documents in the case of Elizabeth Palmer and James   Palmer, appealed from the High Council of Tooele Stake   by James Palmer.    It appears that Elizabeth   Foxall became second wife of James Palmer 43 years ago,   and has had eleven children by him, nine of them now   living, the youngest 20 years old. Brother and Sister   Palmer, not agreeing, have not lived together for about   15 years.  His first wife is dead.  He has a third   wife, Mary Jane Ewer, with whom he lives, and who has   had by him 13 children, 10 of them now living with him,   the youngest about four years old.    Elizabeth Palmer   and children have not had support from Brother   Palmer for 14 years.  They used to live with him in   Skull Valley, on a farm, which he sold several years   ago for $9,000, part cash and part real estate, and   he thinks he ought to give her and her children part   of that means.    The High Council approved   the decision of the Bishop's Court of Grantsville Ward,   to the effect that Brother James Palmer pay Elizabeth   Foxall Palmer certain five acres of land and $1000  in cash, or $1500 in cash without the land, the land  to be deeded to her by Nov. 1, 1894, and the cash to be paid   to her by Sept. 1, 1894.    After carefully considering  the case presented to us, we respectfully recommend 
 that the decision of the High Council be affirmed, with  the modification that the land be deeded to her within a   reasonable specified time, and, (as times are hard),   cash difficult to be obtained, and Brother Palmer  being 74 year old and having a large young family  on his hands) that he be allowed four years in which   to pay the $1000 cash, at the rate of $250 per annum  without interest, and that Bishop James L. Wrath  all, of Grantsville Ward, be requied to make arrange-  ments to secure payment of the same to Elizabeth   J. Palmer, and that Brother Palmer give security for said payments.    Respectfully Your Brethren in the Gospel,   F.D. Richards,  R. J. Burton  Seymour B. Young   John Jaques 
 Salt Lake City, June 27, 1895.  To President Wilford Woodruff, George Q. Cannon,  & Joseph F. Smith.    Dear Brethren, Your committe have   considered the case of Alexander Black and   W. Henry Hurst against James Lees, appealed   from the High Council of Summit Stake.    We find that Brothers Black and Hurst and   Lees all had made some improvements on a piece   of R. R. land, and Brothers Black and Hurst had   used, cultivated, and claimed it for years and   before it was in the market, but that Brother   Lees eventually bought the land of the R. R. Com-  pany and secured the title thereto. Brothers   Black and Hurst, if they could not get any of the   land, wished to be reimbursed for their claims,  water right, and improvements, and various   offers and attempts at adjustment were made,   but without success. Finally Brother Lees   required Brothers Black and Hurst to take away   their moveable improvements (stables, corrals, & c.)  within 20 days or forfeit them. The case was   not tried by the Bishop's Court of Coalville East Ward,   because one of the Bishop's Councillors was related   to Brother Lees, and, to avoid prejudicing the   case, it went to the High Council of the Stake,   whose decision was adverse to Brother Lees, and   a committee of three was appointed by the High 
 Council to visit the premises, investigate the claims   and examine the improvements of the parties, and   award damages.  The Committee reported that   Brother Hurst was entitled to damages amounting to   $3350, and Brother Black to $7700, from Brother Lees.  The report of the Committee was accepted by the High   Council, and approved.  Brother Lees appealed   from the decision of the High Council.    We consider that Brothers Black and Hurst were   entitled to some compensation, and that the amounts   stated above are a moderate estimate for damages   sustained by them, and therefore that the decision  of the High Council was fair and equitable.  Consequently we respectfully recommend that the   aforesaid decision be affirmed.    Your brethren in the Gospel,  F. D. Richards,  R T Burton   Seymour B Young   John Jaques 
 Papeete, Tahiti  Jan 14, 1898  To the First Presidency  Salt Lake City, Utah.  Dear Brethren:   I send by this mail the number  of elders working in the field.   We have not  used any native elders here so far.  I have been  considering the matter for several months.  The  islands are so scattered that they could not be  used in a near vacinity of their homes.  They  would need to go hundreds of miles from home on  to other islands. [ ...ine][] virtuous lives they would  be under the necessity ^of^ taking their families with them  and there [ fare]  I have  that what little they  would do would hardly be worth the effort  I observe that the [li...] sent one supported  native elders to be at work on the islands 
 Salt Lake City, June 27, 1895.  To Presidents Wilford Woodruff, Geo. Q. Cannon, and   Joseph F. Smith.    Dear Brethren - Your Committee have considered   the case of James V. Williams and T. L. Quist, appealed   from the High Council of Sevier Stake.  This is a   question, not of title to land, that not being in   dispute, but of value for prior claims, water right,   and improvements by Brother Quist, and in part   conceded by Brother Williams, to and on a city   lot in Monroe.    The High Council approved   the decision of the Bishop's Court of Monroe Ward,  which was briefly that Brother Williams accept   $50 from Brother Quist, and give him deed for the   lot, or pay Brother Quist $125 within six months, and   keep the lot, water-right, and improvements.  This decision we consider equitable, and we   therefore respectfully recommend its affirmation.    Your brethren in the Gospel,  F. D. Richards.  R TBurton  Seymour B Young  John Jaques

 We were sorry to hear that you and Mrs. Woodruff   had been ill, hope you are all enjoying good   health now,  I was quite surprised to hear of the   death of Sister Webster, I hope that with her   to die, was gain.  She always appeared to me to be   a very kind, zealous, and good woman.    I was really very glad to hear that Miss W.  was married for I think she seems to require the   assistance of someone more than many others, and   I think this Mr Cowand a very fine man. will   you please give my respects to her when you see her.    I have been in Portland for the past two or three   months, and think it probable I shall move my   family there by & by, if I should, Freedom and family   will probably come here,  Ezra and family are well   E. is growing old, is quite gray, he is expecting an   appointment under Gen. Pierce, to be the collecter of   the customs in Portland.  I think he will get it,  it is worth a little more than $3000 per year,    Father is quite smart for a man of his age, his   mind is failing considerable I can see.  Esquire   Southgate has lost four children (all grown) this fall   within three month it effects hom very much.    Matters here in Scanton are about as usual,  no changes of importance, there has been a little   interest in religious matters, some few have been   we hope converted in [[Gut.  Ira and family are well  Calvin is at home this winter, I think he will be   interested in driving stock across the plains this season 
 I had pretty much given up the idea, but you   speak so favorably of the enterprise that I now   think I may have an interest with Calvin and Mr.  Rollins, who will take some cows and young cattle to   Cal for a market.  I want to see you very much   indeed, and Phebe also, though it seems mostly out   of the question and almost useless to think of such a thing.  I think I could spend a few weeks with you very   agreeably.  We hope to see you here "one of these days"  but hardly dare to expect Phebe, for it is a long, tedious,  and tiresome journey.  Should you chance to meet brother   Bullock please give my kindest respect to him, he   was in the [Saluda] at the time of the accident, and   ask him to give my respects to Elizabeth.    Well Brother and Sister, I am very glad that I   have a little news that will interest you.  Mouther  has become a good Christian, it is not the result   of my excitement, nor no hasty movement on her part,  She has always possessed a very kind an amiable   disposition, you know, and been very exemplary in all   her walks, but that is not quite enough, for the past   year she has been thinking seriously of matters pertaining   to her future happenings and God has blessed her in securing  an interest in heaven.  by her example I have been inclined   to make the effort myself, and I feel that our Father in   Heaven has been and is very good to me, my mind has   been seriously inclined since that solemn ordinance was ad  ministered to me at your place, but my reason since until 
 within some two months since for not more fully   embracing Gods blessed promises has been the same   as I advanced to you when speaking on the subject.    I now think that there is nothing that I so much   regret as I do that I had not attended to this   important matter much sooner..  If I had had   heavenly grace and wisdom to have directed me in   all of my business affairs and perplexities through   life I think it would have been much better   for me.  We want you to pray for us that we   may be able to keep all the commandments of   God, and that we may at last with all our dear   friends enter into that blessed city of the New Jerusa  lem that God has prepared for all that love him    I intended writing a short letter to Phebe, but my   engagements will not well admit of it,  I asked   Father if he would write her a few lines and I would   enclose it with this, I do not know yet whether he   will or not, if so I will send with this,    Mrs. Carters health has been quite good for the past   three months until within some two weeks, since   that time she has been rather poorly, our children  are all well.  Mary Fabyone is teaching them at our   house which makes it convenient for us and them    Please remember me kindly to all of my friends   at Salt Lake- Mouther wishes me to say that she   sends a great deal of love to Mrs. Woodruff, Mr. W. and   family, that heavens choicest blessings may be in you   and yours is the prayer of Very Truely your friend    I.

Dear Sir,    Your favor of   the 29th of December was received yesterday   I will pay Messrs Sanborn & Carter $105.  and have just written them a letter   requesting them to forward a receipt  in full for that amount to their repre-  sentative in Congress, and I would   liquidate their claim.    I know nothing about the taxes you   mention.  Before I left I paid brother   Gibbs a pretty heavy bill for road   tax, and one to Colonel J. C. Little  which I understand that it was for   city tax, and I knew or heard of no  other.    Be kind enough to keep me advised   as well as you can how the mill gets  on.  Brother Hautz was to sell my interest   in the park, what my family did not   want, and pay to proceeds of it to you.

All the hardware and   all or nearly all the articles to which no   prices aare affixed, are in the box which   was unfortunately left at St. Louis.  I   requested brother Eldredge to leave the   box he delivered to you, and take the   other and I am very sorry he did not   comply with my request.  I hope you   will not settle with him until this   matter is rectified.  Yours in the N. & E. C.    John M. Bernhisel

 Ms  1352  bx6  fd12  #2  Nauvoo Oct 27th 1844  Dr Brother Woodruff  I sit down this morning to send a  line to you by brother Benjamin Halkins who leaves here to day to  come to England, but inasmuch as it is conference and a very busy  time I can only say a very little.  Since you went away we have  had all kinds of time and some very warm I assure you Es Rigdon  came out decidedly opposed to the Twelve and declares himself above  them and not responsible.  He held secret meetings at Sobys night  after night and there ordained a number of men prophets, priests  and kings without any ordinances or authority.  He likewise taught  them that Joseph was fallen and that the Twelve were corrupt and  wicked, engaged in Bogus making and adultery &c &c. &c.  Ths you  may thnk cause a little rupture because in spite of his curring  it leaked out and although he told the people in publick that  Joseph died holding the keys of authority he taught them in private  that Joseph was a fallen prophet and he had known it for years.  He said in publisk that he did not want to divide the church,   but in private he said he wanted to feel in the minds of the people   and if he could gain enough to go with him he should come out  publickly against the Twelve and rout them.  When these things  were proven to the Twelve some of them sent to see him and finally  got a confession from him which satisfied them that the reports   were true.  The consequence was he was cited to appear before  the High Council in publick meeting for trial, but he refused  to come.  The whole case was investigated and a black catalogue  of accusations substantiated against him, and he was cut off  from the church and delivered over to the buffettings of Satan  for the destruction of the flesh that the spirit may be saved in  the day of the Lord Jesus.  There are a number gone with Es.   Rigdon to "the mountains" as he said as to Pittsburgh 
 Amongst those who have gone with him are John A. Forgeus,   William Richards from New Jersey, George Morey, Joseph H.   Newton, Leonard Soby, Samuel Bennett; Wm" Cottier, George N.  Crouse and several others who had scattered agreeable to the  fundamental principles of Er Rigdons doctrine.  Jared Carter was   cut off with these but he has made a full confession and was   voted to be rebaptised.  The above men even all cut off, by the   unanimous vote of a large congregation of Saints.    James Emmett has drawn off a party and gone  somewhere west but I dont know where.  There are but few  gone with him, but there are enough to go to destruction  with one man for that is there fate.    Lyman Wight is about 200 miles above Galena.  There was about 40 families went with him but four  of the families got tired and came away at the risk of their  lives.  If the statements of these new are true Lyman is  gone to the devil.  He is drunk every day and will not suffer  the men to labor for their bread but he says they must live  on the gentiles so that his company bids fair for being  a real band of "Gadianton robbers."  They leave already  conspired to [n...der] three families of traders in the  neighborhood when they are but way disapointed.  The traders have heard of it and they have circulated  when the Indians return (who are now West receiving their   annuities) to set them as them and I think there is danger  thats they will suffer.  I give you this as the repast of those  who have left his party and I am much inclined to  believe it.  Those who have left Lymans party are Jacob  Neoooom's,  Merrinus W. Loveland, and his son in law  any my brother David with their families.    Now you may well think that after the church has  thus vomited and purged we feel better the atmosphere  seems to be a great deal more pure and the Saints 
 feel better.  The mob are still threatening but we dont apprehend  any danger.  They had arranged to have a Wolfe hunt on the 27th  of last month around Nauvoo and called upon the Missourians  to come and help them.  The object was to surround us and provoke  us to hostilities so that they could get some appearance of legality  to either drive or exterminate us.  We sent word to the Governor   and on the day the Wolf hunt was to take place he was in  Nauvoo at the head of about 500 men to prevent the movements   of the mobs.  The Governor has made great pretence to [pro...]  the Laws and has repeatedly pledged himself to execute them  and have the murderers arrested.  The Sheriff went to  Warsaw and arrested Sharp but the citizens rescued  him.  The Governor then gave them to understand that he   should have them any how and they finally concluded to  give themselves up.  Sharp and Williams and the great  rascal of a Joseph H. Jackson gave themselves up.  the two   former were taken to Turkey and there held to bail.  I  was two near dead to [day ...]We think privately that the  Governor has made a bargain with them and they will get  clear.  We esteem the Governor as one of the wards of the mob  and are well satisfied that he means us no good.  But there  is a God in Israel and he hears our prayers, for we have seen  it repeatedly.  God is with us.  He is with the Twelve in all their  movements and if you was here you would see the months of  the prophet on brother Brigham very plain.  The church feel  well and we will leave a good conference.  Yesterday was   spent in preaching in the morning by [Jon...g] and then   afternoon by Er Taylor.  Things look good, the Temple  moves rapidly,  There are now ten of the Capitals on the walls  and more will be on this week.  You will hear from the  brethren I suppose and the time is drawing news to go to  meeting and I must close by expressing my warmest love  to you and to all of like faith.  Remember me to all  enquirers and I remain yours as ever Wm Clayton 
 P.S.  I want you to send me the earliest opportunity about thirty  or forty yards of good fine Irish Linnen, fine enough for garments  and robes.  And also a good black silk lace veil for my wife.   You will find some who want to send money to the Temple   and you can buy them with it and I will refund it here,   because I cannot get such as I want less than 7/-- pr yard here  and I know they can be got very cheap in England.

My family are all will and I am going  ahead in temporal and spirited matters too and although  the devil howls I intend to go ahead as fast as the Lord will let  me.

Dear Brother:    We take pleasure in recommending to the attention and  support of the Authorities of the Stakes and Wards of Zion, as well  as to the officers and members of the Mutual Improvement Associations,  "THE CONTRIBUTOR," which is the authorized organ of the Young Men's  Mutual Improvement Associations in Zion.  It is being issued with the  sanction and under the supervision of the Association Authorities, and  should be placed in the hands, as far as possible, of all our young  men.  We hope you will kindly use your influence, so far as you can,  consistent with your other duties, to extend the circulation of this  magazine, and thus assist in making it not only creditable to the  Church, but worthy of the organizations which it represents.  It is  being issued regularly each month, is filled with interesting reading  matter, and is published at the moderate price of $2.00 per year,  postpaid.    Your Brethren in the Gospel,    Wilford Woodruff  Jos. F. Smith    Of the General Superintendency of the Y.M.M.I.    Associations of Zion. 
 OFFICE OF  The First Presidency  of the Church of Jesus Christ  of  Latter-day Saints    P. O. Box B.    Salt Lake City Utah  Feb. 27'93.    Prest. David K. Udall,    Springerville, Ariz.    Dear Brother:    It has been brought to my attention that some of the  Presidents of Stakes do not fully understand the communication I addres-  sed to them on the 24th inst. with regard to those to whom recommends should be  granted to attend the dedicatory services at the Temple in this city.  In  that letter I used the words "ordinary recommend", intending that that  expression should convey to the minds of the brethren the idea that such  should be granted subject to the usual provisions and restrictions, or  those members of the church that you could not recommend to the privileges of  its dedication.  We do not deem it just or proper that those who have no  been living their religion, who have neglected their duties, or have  wronged their brethren should have equal privileges with the faithful an  the worthy.    Your Brother,    Wilford Woodruff

Cannon and Joseph F Smith    My Dear Brethren:    Your Draft of Nov 21st  for Twelve hundred and seventy five  -1275 francs duly and thankfully received.  I feel truly greatful  for your Kind asistence in aiding  me to develope the talent that  the Lord has given me and  am using every effort to prepare  my self on my return to be  able to do what will be 
 expected of me.  It is a great privilege to  be here and have this expierence  and my familyt and my self  feel that the Lord is with us  and assisting us in our  earnest endeavors to succeed  Trusting that this will find  you all as we are in the  enjoyment of good health  and that you will please  accept our most sincere  respects.    I am your most obident  sevant friend and Broter    J W Clawson 
 that he knew nothing about military tactics. "I know  nothing about them gentlemen, I am entirely igno-  rant of them" &c. &c. I remarked we had a good opper-  tunity of proving that governor, during the last   campaign, our legions have got a first-rate joke   on you sir, in what? he asked. I replied, in   sending out Capt. Singleton to press take com-  mand of the "Nauvoo Legion." He felt a good   deal chagringd at me beleiving his own statement  relative to his ignorance; he tried to excuse him  self, but only made the matter worse. Elder  Brigham Young is now Leuftenant General & all   things are going on well in the legion. We have   just sent for & obtained 250 United States muskets   we have purchased them ourselves & are not depen-  dant upon others for them. We are also contem-  plating going into the various branches of man-  turing & shall be able this winter, we beleive to   supply all the different tradesmen with all   the work they can do. A few cutlers would be   very serviceable here. Several of our storekeepers  who have been enemies are about moving out,   & we have general peace. we are going to make our   own goods & shall not need them.    The church was never in a more properous   condition that at the present. [illegible] & every 
 other ism is flating out & peace order & union   prevails.  I think that we never had so large   an assembly at a conference, & there never was   more business transacted in the time nor did   I ever see so much harmony nor a greater confidence   manifested in the authorities of the church.  There were upwards ^about^ 500 I believe ordained into   The seventies, & 100 into The High Priests Quorum    We have divided the United States of into   different districts & have appointed one or more   high priests ro preside in those different dis-  tricts, & to take charge of the churches embraced   in their several bounderies & to preside at   the different conferences that shall be held [illegible]  ally at the most convenient point in   respective districts:  much the same as the   churches are organized in England.  This makes   it convenient as the High Priest can report to   their presidents, & the presidents to the Twelve,.    There are now eleven quorums of the seven-  ties organized & filled up, & a twelvth forming, so   you will perceive that we have not been idle.  The  first seventy have generally been made presidents   hence there are presidents over the several seven-  ties & a presidency appointed over the whole, so   hence the presidents of the seventies can report   to the first presidency of the seventies & they to the   Twelve. 
 a few business matters & I must close.  I never   received one of your "Stars", although I receive every   other foreign paper regularly.  Be so kind as inform   those persons who send papers to us (for I know not   to whom we are indebted for them) to have them directed   them to the Editor of the "Nauvoo Neighbor," insted   of to John Taylor, as it sanes postage.  Whatever   charges there are on those papers I hope you will   defray & charge to my [illegible ].  I should be pleased to get    ( Mr. Wilford Woodruff  No 36 Chapel St  Liverpool    John Taylor  Nauvoo Oct 13 1944  Arrived Jan 13, 1845 )    We have forwarded 200 each of the 16, 17, & 18 nos. of the "Times   & Seasons," with Br.

I need not inform you that a little money   would be very acceptable.  I should feel obliged if you   could raise me some in the spring, as I have some   payments to meet then.  Mrs. Taylor joins in love to you   & Sister Woodruff.  God help you with all the blessings of   the new & everlasting covenant.  The Twelve are generally   well My love to Br.

Dear Brother:  You have already been advised of the decision of a recent meeting of the First Presidency and Apostles with regard to those who should be admitted to the dedicatory services at the Tenple in this City. To-day another meeting was held and the question again considered and it was unanimously decided by the brethren present that greater [lenioney] should be shown to the people, and that all having a membership in the church, who so desire, should have the privilege of being present and [t] recommends for this purpose should be granted them on their application. If any question of unworthiness arise it should be decided by the [pr] constituted church courts in the regular manner, but the request for recommend to attend these services should [notbe] made the occasion of investigating a member's fellowship.    Please communicate this decision to the Bishops in your Stake without delay.    Your Brother,  Wilford Woodruff

We think it proper to call your attention to this matter, as now is not a time, above all others, for the saints to be divided or have any cause of contention whatever introduced amoung them. The command is for us always to be united; but if there ever was a time for that command to be listened to with the greatest strictness, it would seem that now is that period. Brother Kempe may have exaggereted the danger of the position; if so, we shall be very glad to learn it.

 Copy    Nov. 26, 1890    To the Presidency of the High Council of the St. Johns Stake of Zion.    Dear Brethren:  In the case of A. M. Jenny vs. the Printing and Publishing Company of St. Johns, Arizona, which was appealed from your court to the First Presidency and your decision confirmed by them Nov. 12, 1888, and you so notified. We have to say that since that time the case has been brought again to our attention; and while in no way dissenting from our former conclusions we recommend, in view of certain obscure details which now appear diffacult of verification, that the matter [become] promised by the payment of Brother Milner of $200; and upon his doing this, that you withdraw your objections to his [restor-] tion to fellowship in the church. If you accept these reccomendations please advise us, and we will notify Brother Milner to send you a check for the amount, which we understand from Prest. Udall's letter he has on deposit    over 
 with the Arizona Cooperative Mercantile Institution    With much Respect,    Your Brethren,    Signed  Wilford Woodruff  Geo Q Cannon  Jos. F. Smith 
 OFICE OF  The First Presidency  of the   Church of Jesus Christ  of  Latter-day Saints    P.O.BOX.B.    Salt Lake City, Utah  March 29 ' 93.    Elder David K. Udall.    Preside of St. Johns Stake.    Dear Brother:-    We extend an invitation to you to be present at the First session of the dedication services of the Salt Lake Temple, to be held on the morning of April 6th, 1893.    Through you we also tender a similar invitation to your two counselors; to regular members of the High Council; to the Presidency of the High Priests' Quorum; and to the Bishops and their Counselors.; also to the Patirarchs.    The entrance will be at the south gate, which will be open at 8:30 A.M. on the day named.    It is desirable that you and those brethren whom we invite through you, should appear at the entrance for admission in a body.    All those who present themselves will be required to show recommends.    Your Brethren,    Wilford Woodruff  Geo. Q. Cannon  Jos. F. Smith

Udall  Springerville    Dear Brother: -   You are hereby authorized to seal Sister Charlotte Webb to Elder Robert Marion Tyler, at the same time advising them to visit one of the Temple at the earliest convenient time so that she can receive her endowments, and they be sealed at the altar. If it should so happen, though it is not probable, that they never have this opportunity, then the ceremony performed by you, under this authorization, will have full force and effect.    Replying further to the inquiries in your favor of 19th inst., I will say--A Bishop's Court is authorized to excommunicate from the Church, for cause, lay members and brethren holding the Aaronic Priesthood without referring the case to the High Council of the Stake. Of course the parties excommunicated have the right of appeal to that body. But if the accused holds the Melchesidek Priesthood then the Bishop's Court has authority only to disfellowship him and report its proceedings to the High Council for further action. With regard to presenting the names of those who have been disfellowshipped or excommunicated to the members of the Ward, - this is sometimes done for information, where deemed desirable, but not for the purpose of sustaining or reversing the decision of the court, but there are cases where justice and mercy would both be better served by giving the offence the least publicity possible, and confining the knowledge of the wrong doing to 
 those actually interested and to those who have, by reason of their official position, are obliged to be made acquainted with the facts.    Your Brother,  Willford Woodruff

Dear Brother:    Your favor of June 17th has been received. So far as that portion is concerned which relates to the reorganization of the Alpine ward, we will say that your selection of Elder Joseph N. Heywood for Bishop has our approval, provided he is acceptable to the people of the ward. If, on presenting his name, you find this to be the case, yourself and counselors are hereby authorized to ordain him to the Bishopric, yourself being mounth. You can ordain his counselors in like manner when they are selected and accepted.    In accordance with your suggestion, we have notified Elder David Rencher for a mission to the United States.    With kindest regards,    We are your brethren,    Wilford Woodruff  Geo. Q. Cannon   
 OFFICE OF  The First Presidency  of the  Church of Jesus Christ  of  Latter-day Saints    P.O.Box.B.    Salt Lake City, Utah    Feb. 8, 1898.    To the Presidents of Stakes throughout Zion.    Dear Brethren: -   The requests for more missionaries made by the Presidents of the various missionary fields, especially in the United States, are increasing so rapidly and growing so pressing that we have thought it well to make a further requisition upon the various Stakes of Zion. This we do [now:] asking the Stake Presidencies to send us with as little delay as possible the names of as many brethren as they consistently can.    As a rule brethren over 45 years of age are no able to satisfactorly endure the tolls and vicissitudes of missionary life, but, on the other hand, there are robust, well preserved brethren to be found among us who can do so for a number of years later. In making these selections we shall trust to your good judgment, and that will seek the promptings and guidance of the Spirit of God.    With this we enclose blank forms for your use in sending in your lists of brethren suggested for these labors.    Your Brethren in the New and Everlasting Covenant,    Wilford Woodruff  Geo. Q.

 Edwin Evans   Aug 8/92,  Nibelle France]August 8th 92.  Prests. Wilford Woodruff,  George Q. Cannon   Joseph F. Smith -,  Dear Brethren,    At present   I am out in the country   working from nature under   M. Rigolot who Bro Pratt   has made mention of   in his letters to you some   time ago.  M. Rigolot is   noted for his brilliant   sunlights and his clost   observance to nature.    He is more of a realistic   painter than an idealistic  one, that is why we appreciate   him so much as a   landscape teacher. 
 Sunlight painting is   taking quite a prominent   part in modern French   art, and I may justly say  that in this they far excell   Artists of an earlier date -   probably the greatest reason   for this is that the old  Masters did not pay so   much attention to Landscape  painting as the modern men  do - Sunlight painting   affords an opportunity  for a very brilliant display   of colors; but is considered   to be lacking in poetry -  The artist Corot used to   say that sunlight   was vulgar.    As I expect to  paint the country that   I live in, and as you   are aware Utah is noted 
 for her sunlights, there   being but few gray-days   and very little atmosphere.  I have thought it best to   pay especial attention to   this branch of landscape   painting - I shall remain   under M. Rigolot for the   balance of this month, and   then I will return to Paris   and enter the academy for   a couple of months, and   return to Utah about the   first of November -   I have not felt able to   get out designes for the   decorating of the temple,  but shall be very glad   if I can assist others   in executing theirs -   I have enough money   to last me for about 
 six weeks.  If you can   send me Three Hundred   and Fifty Dollars ($350,)  it will do me while I   remain here and see me   home.  Bros Pratt and   Fairbanks have left for   Utah.  Bro Haag is in   the Julian Academy  Br Clawson I have not   herd from since he left   Paris last spring for   Rome.    I will say before   closing that I am well  pleased with the progress   that all of us have made   while in school and while   in the country under  M. Rigolot.  Hoping   that you are enjoying   good health.    I am your brother  Edwin Evans 
 P.S. The safest way of sending funds across   the plains I think is by drafts or Government   funds - I hope all our friends are well   please remember me kindly to all..  Should   any of them come to the States or to Maine   it would afford me much pleassure to have   them call on me.    The suffering in in huge cities this winter   is beyond parallel.    Yours in haste   I. F. Carter

Smith    Dear Brethern:  As the time is   now drawing near when I desire   to return home I have taken   this occasion to appeal to  you for assistence.    I hope to leave   about the first of May and 
 as near as I have been   able to ascertain it will   cost in the neighborhood   of Three hundred and fifty ($35000)  dollars for me and my   family provided I am able   to get all the advantages   in rates that are usually   given to our Elders.  There   are a few little things that   I should like to get to   assist me in the work 
 3.  I hope to be able to do,   and if you feel that Fifty   ($5000) more can be   spared to me I should   be very thankful indeed   making $40000 in all.    There will be so many   things to attend to before   leaving I have written now   that I may be able to   make definite arrangements   for our passage.  I realize   the enormity of this request    
 and am sure that you are   pressed for means at this  time - yet I am anxious to   get back home and to work  I feel that the Lord has   blessed me greatly in the   past and pray that with his   assistance to be able to bring   forth the fruits of my labors.    It is with great pleasure   that I am able to say that we   are all well and sincerely hope   this may find you and yours the   same.  Trusting that you will honor   me with a speedy reply as time   presses.  I am your obident servant   friend and brother.  J..W. Clawson

I feel very thankful  for your prompt reply to my request   and though I cannot tell just   when we start will notify you

 160 C. Street  Salt Lake City,  March 27, 1889    Pres. Wilford Woodruff and Council of the Apostles    Dear Brethren,  The General Board of the Deseret Sunday School Union ask your kind consideration of the feasibility of granting the the Union the privilege of holding its annual meeting on the evening of either Saturday or Sunday of the forthcoming general Conference.    Several important matters relating to Sunday School work should be brought before those engaged in that cause; and 
 it is very desirable that the meeting be held while the majority of the people from the different stakes who feel interested in this work, will be in the city.    At a special meeting of the Board, held last evening, I was directed to communicate with you in their behalf. They would like very much to have the usual meeting but feel that under present circumstances it will not be best to hold any, unless one of  the evenings named, can be secured for that purpose.    An early reply will oblige as their arrangements depend on your decision.    Your Bro. in the Gospel,    L.W. Richards  Secretary

 PRESIDENT'S OFFICE.    Salt Lake City, Utah, Oct. 11; 1888.    President David K. Udall,    St. Johns, Apache Co., Arizona    Dear Brother:  Your letter of Oct. 3rd came duly to hand and was perused with interest. The letter was read and the contents considered by the Council of Apostles at their meeting yesterday. Apostle John Henry Smith and Bishop Burton being present.    The question of the indebtedness of the St. Johns Ward on the St. Johns purchase was considered, and you are requested to furnish us a detailed statement of the indebtedness on that purchase to the Church. You will also please send us your suggestions as to the propriety of building a Stake Academy, or Stake meeting house or Ward meeting house, together with the proposed locations for any of such buildings.    It was also decided by the Council of Apostles that the settlements of the Saints on the Little Colorado and its tributaries be maintained, and that the Saints located in those settlements should remain where they have been called, and assist in securing to themselves and to the Saints the locations which have been made, that the Stakes of Zion shall be strengthened and their cords lengthened. 
 Our Semi-Annual Conference is over, and much valuable instruction was imparted.    My health is good, as is also that of my brethren who are with me, and they join me in kindest regards to yourself and the Saints.    I remain,    Your Brother in the Gospel,    W Woodruff 
 OFFICE OF  The First Presidency  of the Church of Jesus Christ  of  Latter-day Saints    P. O. Box. B.    Salt Lake City, Utah.  Nov. 13th, 1891.    Prest. David K. Udall  St. Johns Stake of Zion.    Dear Brother:    We hear that the Constitutional Convention of your Ter-  ritory has adopted a Constitution which, without being free from objections,  is probably as good a Constitution as is likely to be adopted at any time in the near  future.    The advantages of living in a State ought to be highly valued by every  citizen. It is true, State government is more expensive; but under that  form the people have the right to govern themselves and to elect their own  officers, instead of their being appointed at the caprice of politicians.    What is the feeling of our people upon the subject? Are they likely to  vote in favor of the Constitution or not?    It is very important to them that what they do in this matter should be  done carefully, and with due deliberation.    Were we living in your Territory, with the knowledge that we have of the  situation, we think we would certainly vote for the adoption of the Consti-  tution, because we are of the opinion that the results would be beneficial.    Our view is that our people should vote for the Constitution, unless  there are strong and overpowering reasons of which we have no knowledge  why they should not.    Our object in mentioning this to you is that through inattention or  carelessness the election should not be allowed to go without those who  have the right to vote expressing their views by ballot on this important  subject. Everyone that has a vote should not fail to express his will 
 2.    upon this question at the polls, when the occasion for doing so shall ar-  rive.    In writing in this strain to you we do so with the expectation that you  will take the necessary steps to bring this matter clearly to the attention  of all who are interested, that nothing may be lost by negligence.    The question of holding a general conference of the Stakes in Arizona  has been brought to our attention by Elders John Henry Smith and John Mor-  gan, and after conversing with them we are of the opinion that a conference  held annually, commencing on the first Sunday in July, would probably be as  convenient for all concerned as any that we know of. We understand that  the place of holding this conference has been agreed upon by yourself and  the other Presidents of Stakes, and that Pine Top is the place.    With kindest regards,    We are    Your Brethren,    Wilford Woodruff  Geo. Q. Cannon  Jos. F. Smith

Dear Brother:    Replying to your favor of 9th,inst.to the Missionary Commit-  tee of the Apostles,I will say that the two young men whose names you sug-  gest for missions to Scandinavia, have been placed on our list in this  office, and will be called as soon as they are needed.    I am in entire accord with the views you express regarding the unde-  sirability of holding a Conference in your Stake next June,and think you  had better inform the Saints that that Conference will not be held,but in  place thereof invite as many as possible to attend the Conference at Pine  Top in July.    With kindest regards,    Your Brother,    Wilford Woodruff 
 OFFICE OF  The First Presidency  of the  Church of Jesus Christ  of  Latter-day Saints    P. O. Box. B.   Salt Lake City, Utah.  October 16th 1892.    PREST. DAVID K. UDALL,    St. Johns.    Dear Brother:-    In accordance with the vote of the Priesthood which was taken in the  Salt Lake Temple on the 10th ins t.,apportionments of the amount necessary  to complete the Temple for its dedication on the 6th day of April,1893,  have been made to the various stakes of Zion.  The apportionment to your  stake is $600.00.   The allotments to the stakes have been placed as  low as possible, and it is necessary that each stake make up its full  amount.    We suggest that you and your counselors consider the circumstances of  the brethren of your stake, and select therefrom as many as are able to  pay say from one to four hundred dollars each, to complete the House of  the Lord; and then an appeal be made to them to pay such amounts as you  may deem proper.  This being done you can then call upon the other mem-  bers of your stake to make up whatever amount is necessary to complete  your allotment.    If the money is paid, say, one half on or before December 15th 1892,  and one half on or before March 1st 1893, it will answer the purpose.  But  we trust you will bring this matter to the attention of the Saints without  delay, as there must be no failure in this great undertaking. 
 (2)    We feel to promise the people, through you, the blessings of the Lord  both temporal and spiritual, if they will faithfully and freely meet this  obligation which we have all taken upon ourselves.    We remain your brethren in the Gospel,    W Woodruff  Geo. Q. Cannon  Jos. F. Smith 
 PRESIDENT'S OFFICE    CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST  OF  LATTER-DAY SAINTS.    P.O.BOX B.    Salt Lake City .U.S.  April 19, 1890.    President David K. Udall and Counselors.    St. Johns Stake of Zion.    Dear Brethren:    Brother John B. Milner has been to see us,in company with  Brother Joseph Crosby and Brother Elijah N. Freeman, in relation to his  case that was tried before the High Council of your Stake.  The object in  bringing Brothers Crosby and Freeman was to give us an opportunity to learn  from them concerning the trial before the Bishop's Court and before the  High Council.  After hearing all that was said upon the subject, and espe-  cially from Brother Milner concerning his rot having been properly notified,  and his willingness to agree to that which was reasonable to make satisfac-  tion, we promised him to write to you.  The assurance that Brother Freeman  gave concerning the willingness of the brethren to pay it themselves rather  than have any trouble, prompted us to exhort Brother Milner to seek an early  settlement, as we believed from the spirit that Brother Freeman described as  existing among the Saints who are interested in this case, that it would not  be a difficult matter for Brother Milner to make affairs right if he had the  disposition he should have, as a Latter-day Saint.    Brother Milner is a man of peculiar temperament, and cannot  very well be judged by the standard which we expect other men to be measured 
 by; but we believe he desires to retain the fellowship of the people and  his standing in the Church; and while we do not think it would be proper to  submit to wrong from him, still if you can meet him in the spirit of con-  cession no doubt it will have the effect to save him from serious difficulty  in connection with his standing in the Church.  The reports we hear of him   while in England, written by Brother Teasdale, President of the British Mis-  sion, give us a good opinion of his labors while a missionary in England,  and this was about the time by your action he was severed from the Church.    Trusting you will be able to settle this matter to the satisfac -  tion of all concerned,and agreeable to the Spirit of the Lord.    We remain,    Your Brethren,    Wilford Woodruff  Geo. Q. Cannon  Jos. F. Smith 
 PRESIDENT'S OFFICE Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.    P.O. BOX B.  Salt Lake City, U.T. June 20, 1890.    Preside David K. Udall and Counselors,    St. Johns Stake of Zion    Dear Brethrens:  Shorthly after the last general conference in this city we had one or two interviews with John B. Milner at which Brother Freeman and Brother Crosby of your stake were present; and we became satisfied from all that was said that there had been irregularities in the trial of the case of John B. Milner before the Bishop's court and before the High Council though we did not say so to him. Brother Freeman heard all the conversation and understood its purport, also Brother Crosby - if he is with you still.. We have received the enclosed papers from John B. Milner concerning this case, and we send them to you for your considereation. John B. Milner is a very peculiar man; he has oddities of manner and in his way of doing business that create unfavorable impressions concerning his soundness; but we believe that underlying these peculiarities he has a strong love for the Gospel and values his connection with the people very highly. We do not know why he should have been published as excommunicated as this is not the general custom, and there are many cases more flagrant than his that are no published. We might not however have noticed the publication particularly had it not been that at the time of the appearance of the notice in our papers we had advices from President 
 George Teasdale in England that John B. Milner was doing quite a good work as a missionary in that country, though he had not been sent there as a missionary.    We would like you to give this case the fairest possible consideration, and let us know what you have to say on the subject. We would very much like to have this business settled up and this man restored to a standing in the Church if it can be done consistently with the principles of righteousness. In dealing with men we have to take them as they are, and deal more leniently with some than with others because of the difference of their organization and knowledge. The Lord deals with His children in this manner, and we ought to deal with each other in this spirit. A rule we might with perfect propriety apply to one man might not in perfect justice be applied to another.    With kindest regards,    Your Brethren,    Willford Woodruff  Geo. Q. Cannon  Jos. F. Smith

Udall    St. Johns Stake of Zion,    Dear Brethren:    Please let me know by letter or telegram within ten days as near as you possibly can, how many persons from your stake expect to attend the dedication of the Temple in this city. In this estimate you may include all baptized members of the church of every age; children under eight years will be admitted to these services. Without this information the Presidency cannot make the necessary arrangements as to the days the saints from your Stake will have the privilege of attending. It must be remembered that none will be admitted to the dedication without first obtaining  an ordinary reccomend from their Bishop, countersigned, as usual, by the President of the Stake.    Your Brother,    Wilford Woodruff 
 PRESIDENT'S OFFICE,    Salt Lake City, Jan. 24, 1888.    President D. K. Udall,    St. Johns, Apache Co, Arizona.    Dear Brother: - Your letter of Jan. 18th, respecting your Stake Academy, etc, has been received.    We will forward your letter to Elder Karl G. Masser, at Provo, with a request that he make you a draft of such a building as you need, so far as he is able to do so.    In regard to the rock hauled on Labor [Tithing], for your Stake Tabernacle, to the amount of $331.00, and your wishes to use the same on your Stake Academy, you are at liberty to use the said rock for that purpose.    Inasmuch as your High Council has taken action in regard to the fellowship of Brother John B. Milner, it will be proper for you to notify the Presidency of the Stake or the Bishop of the Ward where he now resides, of your action.    My health is good, and my time is fully occupied.    With kind regards,    Your Brother,    W. Woodruff

Dear Brother, -   In compliance with your request, per letter received Jan. 24th, I enclose you herewith a rough draft of a building for a Stake Academy, with lecture room, as prepared by Prof. Karl G. Maeser, also a copy of so much of his letter which pertains to this subject.    I trust this will be satisfactory to you and give you, at least, his ideas of the kind and size of the building you need.

 PRESIDENT'S OFFICE.  Salt Lake City, Utah, August 9, 1888.    President David K. Udall,    St. Johns, Apache Co., Arizona.    Dear Brother:  Respecting a new Bishop for the Heber Ward, it will be well for yourself and Counselors and the High Council to canvass the names of the brethren most suitable and seek for the mind of the Spirit, so that you may decide upon someone to fill this position. When you have thus decided, you can send the name to me, or if one of the Twelve should visit there soon--which we expect will be the case--you can submit your decision to him, and iffacceptable to the people he can be ordained to that position.    The letter that President Jesse N. Smit and yourself wrote in relation to political matters in the County has been laid aside to submit to the Council of the Apostles; but at the mettings that we have held since its receipt other matters were so pressing that we did not reach that. As your Quarterly Conference is approaching, perhaps it will not be necessary for us to write to you upon this subject, because we are trying to arrange for Brother John Henry Smit and Bishop Robert T. Burton to attend the Snowflake Conference on the 1st. & 2nd. of Sept., and the Conference at your place on the 
 8th. &9th. When they meet with you they doubtless will be able to give you counsel upon all points connected with your situation that you will require, as they can do so much better on the ground than we can from this distance, not being familiar with all the points at issue. I have notified these brethren of our wish to have them attend these conferences, and expect to receive replies from them upon the subject. If they cannot go, we shall arrange, if possible, for some others to go, as we think you need to presence of wise and influential ment to enable you to reach definite conclusions respecting the differences of views which may exist amoung you. I think it will be well for yourself and such of the brethren of your Stake as can do so, to meet, as you suggest you think of doing, with the Saints at Snowflake on the occasion of their approaching conference.    With kind regards,    Your Brother,    Wilford Woodruff 
 OFFICE OF  The First Presidency  of the  Church of Jesus Christ  of  Latter-day Saints    P.O.Box B.   Salt Lake City, Utah  December 31, 1896    TO THE PRESIDENTS OF STAKES,    Dear Brethren:- In consequence of the  decision which was reached at our last April Conference upon the sub-  ject of making allowances to different officers of the Church for ser-  vices, affairs have been in an unsettled condition, and there has been  uncertainty prevailing upon the subject of drawing from the Church any  compensation for services rendered.  As was explained on that occasion,  it was not the design to deprive the brethren who are laboring in  various capacition and spending more or less of their time in the  public service, of some compensation.  The design was to prevent the  growth of a feeling that certain officers in the Church were to receive  a certain amount.  We all felt that it was not a wise thing - in fact,  that it was contrary to the purpose of the Almighty - that the minis-  ters of His Church should receive fixed sums as salaries.  And it was  pleasing to us to see the manner in which our views upon this question  were received by the assembled brethren.    The question has arisen, What allowance shall be made to the  Presidents of Stakes and their Counselors? Shall we allow them the same  amounts that we did formerly? Or what amounts shall we allow them?    In order to answer this question, we suggest that each Presi-  dent of Stake and his Counselors get together, and, knowing each  other's circumstances, decide what amount they think would be proper  under the circumstances for each of them to receive; with the under-  standing, however, that the aggregate amount shall not exceed the  amount heretofore allowed.  There may be members of the different  Presidencies of Stakes who may be in circumstances where they need  but little, if anything, from Church funds to help sustain them, and  who would take pride in rendering their services gratuitously to the  Church.  Some of these may be Presidents, and some Counselors.  On the  other hand, there may be some Presidents and some Counselors who are in  circumstances which require that they should receive some compensation  for their services.

Subscription Price, - 1.25  Per Annum, in Advance.  Andrew Jenson,  PUBLISHER OF   THE HISTORICAL RECORD.  OFFICE - No. 154 N. Second West Street.  Salt Lake City, Utah, Aug 12 1887    Pres. W. Woodruff  Dear Brother.  Your favor of the   6th  inst. rec'd.  I beg leave to say in reply that I   did not publish the names referred to without first   consulting such persons as would be immediately   interested; and in such cases as personal injury   would be likely to occur, or where parties themselves   did not wish the circumstance of their having   been sealed to the Prophet made publice, we have   not published them.  Most of what I published in   this connection has been in print, ^before^ and hence was   public property already, and what new matter I   added I have not added without counseling with   those whose right it is to counsel me, or at least   making full explanations of my plan and object,   which was simply this:  A great number of persons,   (among them tho of my own brothers) are constantly   listening to the Josephites, who claim that the Prophet   Joseph never taught nor practised the principle of   plural marriage, and they are gaining followers daily,   perhaps, on that ground.  I have argued, reasoned and   
 discussed with some of them, until I thought it was  necessary, for the sake of honest people, who are willing   to be convinced, to republish in a compiled manner   such affidavits and testimonies as had formerly been  made public, but were scattered and partly lost, having   been published in different papers and at different   periods.  Now, brethren; with the exception of summing   up and adding a few new names, I have simply   stated what has been stated before, and I hope no   harm has been done, but that good will result there  from.  By way of further explanation I beg leave to   say that the article was published before I knew any  thing of a Constitutional Convention coming of, or I   would perhaps have had judgment enough to postpone   publication at present, or at least referred the matter   to you before printing.  There is, however, one consolation   in connection ^with^ of of a possibility of harm being done,  namely that the "Record" circulates only among our   own people, and save a harmless notice about it   in the Salt Lake Tribune I have heard nothing so   far ^originating from my article^ that would harm us politically.  In justice to   myself I deem this explanation necessary, adding   that I at all times shall hold myself subject to   counsel from those in authority in the Church over   me, and that I, in consequence, shall  (according to   your desire and judgment) not  "give any more   names," until you shall advise me to do.    With kind regards I remain Your Brother   in the Gospel of Christ,  Andrew Jenson. 
 Salt Lake City, Feb. 20, 1890  President Wilford Woodruff  Dear Brother:    Your kind favor of   the 15thinst. reached me on the 17th,  and I accept your ultimatum as regards   my proposition of Sept. 23, 1889, although   necessarily somewhat disappointed since   the delay - awaiting your answer - will   have considerable bearing upon my   business operations in the future.    As I am anxious to continue my   historical labors and gather material  together, which I at all times hold   subject to the Church historians, if they   desire copies, I would kindly ^ask^ if the   $5000 allowance from the General  Tithing ^Office^ toward the maintainance of my   family (which I have been drawing   during the last two years) will be   continued?  If so, I think, I shall be   able to continue the "Record" until   such times as you may wish to take   the matter in hand.  I have on hand   already considerable matter which I have   gathered concerning the various Stakes of Zion,  but finding the undertaking a greater   work, and coupled with many more difficulties,  than I at first anticipated, it will take   several years yet to complete it.   
 Awaiting your kind answer to this, at   your earliest convenience, I remain  Your Brother in the Gospel,  Ancrew Jenson

Salt Lake City, Utah, Sept. 23, 1889  President Wilford Woodruff, Geo. Q. Cannon  and Joseph F. Smith.    Dear Brethren:  Having now finished the   four volumes of the "Historical Record" in which I promised   the public to publish a certain kind class of historical infor-  mation pertaining to the history of the Church, I feel  it to be my privilege, and perhaps my duty, to consult   with you, before proceeding to lay other plans for the future.    Ever since I commenced my historical labors, about   [43] years ago, I have been under the impression that my   work ought to be performed under the immediate supervision   of the Church Authorities, and that anything I published per   taining to Church history should by them be subjected to the   strictest criticism before being printed.  Such was ^indeed^ the case as   long as I published in the Danish language, Elder Erastus   Snow being appointed by the late Pres. Brigham Young, and   subsequently by the late Pres. John Taylor, to supervise my   labors.  But since commencing the "Record," four years   ago, I have published on my own responsibility, no one   having been appointed to supervise my work.  This, I may   say, has often grieved me, and although I have at times

Richards   and others of the Twelve, I have by no means done this   so often as I have felt a want to, as I did not wish   to intrude upon their time ^as long as I was engaged in a private enterprise.^  I am, however, now able   to place my ^last four years^ work before you in a form that you in a   few minutes may be able to judge somewhat of its   merits, and ^also^ understand the nature of ^my^ ability as a   compiler of historical data and facts.    Having done so much I am now in ^such^ a position that   ^I can^ continue or discontinue my publication, according to your   council; but I am under the impression now more than   ever before, that my works ought to be published by   authority, or not be published at all.  And in order to   make myself plain I hereby ask leave to state that   I am willing to devote my entire future life in the   interest of Church history, and I offer you my services,   from the 1st  of January next, with or without any   compensation of a material nature,  just as you desire;   and shall be willing to work at the Historian's Office   or travel through the country gathering historical   information, according to your best judgment.

If it is continued by authority it has,   I think, not a bad foundation to stand on; and if stopped   I trust its mission hitherto have resulted in good, and   that sometime in the future it, or something similar,   may again see the light of day.    During the last 18 months I have received from the   Church $5000 per month (from the Tithing Office), it being  an allowance made in order to enable me ^to^ sustain my   family while gathering historical information concerning   the several Stakes of Zion etc.  Not having access to the docu-  mentary history of the Church, I have deemed it unwise   to publish the information thus far gained; and I propose   to deliver the manuscripts to the Church historian together  with a complete index to the history of Joseph Smith   publshed in the "Millennial Star."  This alone has cost me   month's of labor; and before I am through with my

 Copy of a letter from the First Presidency to  President Wilford Woodruff.  Salt Lake City,  November 12th 1885  President Wilford Woodruff  and Council of the Twelve Apostles  Dear Brethren:  Letters which we receive in response  from those who are called to go on missions prompt us  to communicate with you upon this subject. We are  sending out a large number of missionaries in various  directions and it is important that in making sel-  ections we should get the best material available for the  purpose. It is not unreasonable to suppose that many very  worthy persons who would make excellent missionaries  are overlooked, while many who are not so suitable are  selected. It appears to us that this business of selecting  missionaries can be more systematized, and be attended  with more satisfactory results than it is at the present   time. The calls for missionaries should be considered  by the Twelve Apostles. They should understand the  fields to be supplied and the kind of men that are  needed to supply them. At the present time they travel

Wilford Woodruff    Dear Brother:  Knowing that you are cramped for means, I feel sorry in having to ask you for a raise in my salary; but I desire to purchase a home as soon possible, and find it a very hard struggle under my present (wage $60.00 per month, 1/3 cash). After the rent is payed and my other expences, I haven't much left.    Hoping you will answer favorably on my petition, if possible, and not think me presenmable.    I reamin, Your Brother  Jos.

Dear Brethren:- It appears to me, in view of the political changes which have been made of late in the nation, and those which are likely to occur in the near future in your Territory, that it is of the utmost importance for the Latter-day Saints to so arrange their affairs and organize their domestic and other relations as not ot become a prey to the wicked designs of politicians and persons disposed to cause our people trouble in consequence of their religious convictions and practices in accord therewith. I trust that those to whom the watchcare of the saints has been entrusted- the Presidency of Stakes, the Bishops and leading Elders of the Church- will be wide awake in these critical times and leave no duty undone which they can do, to guard and protect the interests of the people of God with whom they are called to labor; and by the eye of faith and wisdom that they will be able to foresee the dangesrs which may threaten, and take the necessary steps to forewarn, advise and direct, for their safety, such as may be exposed to the evil intentions of their enemies.    Having called your attention to this important subject, I leave it with you to take such steps as in your wisdom and in the spirit of your callings, propted by the Holy Ghost, you may consider the most prudent, safe and effectual.    With kind regards,    Your Brother,    W Woodruff

 Andrew Jenson  Dec. 1' 97  L. D. S. Historian's Office   P. O. BOX 1678.  Salt Lake City, Utah, Dec. 1, 1897  President Wilford Woodruff.  Dear Brother!    Yesterday morning Prest.  Angus M. Cannon called on me and brought   a special and direct message from you to   the effecct that you desired me to give   to L. P. Neve a deed to some property   which I own in Mill Creek, and which   said Neve has been suing me for in   court.  Immediately upon receiving your   message, I want to my attorney, Bro.  Franklin L. Richards, and instructed him   to hand over the deed which had   already been executed.  And L. P. Neve   will be notified by me personally to-day   that Bro. Richards will give him the   deed on his payment of some tax   money and a portion of the court   expenses.  The property in question is worth   about $5000 (it cost me more than that),  and is the same property to which I executed   a deed to the trustee-in-trust, about   1 1/2 years ago, which deed could not then be 
 delivered till a decision of the court had been   obtained    I take it for granted that you   understand the case (though I have not   mentioned the matter to you myself) and that   you had good reasons for making the request.  Of course everything I have is on the altar,  according to covenants which I have made;  and I feel to bow in obedience to your   request, though I must confess that under   existing circumstances, I cannot think of a   person that I would not rather give my   property to than L. P. Neve.    In order not to place myself in   a false light before you, I will state that   I have already made up my mind to give   up the property, according to a most unjust   decision of a court, and was only waiting   for the adjustment, by my attorney, of some   miner matters connected with it.  But   I had not looked for a request from   the president of the Church to do so.    With the best of feeling toward   you, I remain  Your Brother in the Gospel,  Andrew Jenson    Note:  Jensen was seen in regard  to this by G J Gibbs, about one &   a half hours after it was brought to the office by himself,   & was informed by Bro Gibbs that Pres. Woodruff had   reconsidered his this matter and withdrawn what he requested   A.M. Cannon to say to him & that he was to act with Bro. Neve   as though he had not sent him any word at all. 
 L. D. S. Historian's Office,    P. O. Box 1678.    Salt Lake City, Utah, Dec. 18. 1894    President Wilford Woodruff    Dear Brother:  During my travels  in the interest of Church history during  the last four years, including visits to  the States, Mexico and Canada. I have  expended considerable means in defraying  traveling expenses.  I have also worn  out a buggy entirely, and another in  part, on my journeyings, as I have  visited quite a number of the Stakes  traveling with my own conveyance  I have also employed a member of  my family a great portion of the time  to help me in my labors, which has  enabled me in scores of instances to  get through with certain work in a day  when it otherwise would have taken  two.  I have not asked the Church  to bear my traveling expenses so far,  nor do I desire to ask for that to  be done in the future, as long, as I  can possibly defray them myself; but 
 I write these lines simply to ask if  it would not be proper to allow  me some credit on tithing.  I am  behind in my tithing this year, and  also for last year, and having spent  the means which should have gone  to the tithing office as stated, I  would be pleased to have an entry  made to my credit on this year's  account, if it can be done done consistantly  If not, I desire to pay my tithing any  way, as I am a believer in the principle,  and want my record on earth as  complete as possible in this regard, as  well as in other respects.    Praying the Lord to bless you  and your Counselors with heaven's  richest blessings, and that you during  this inclement part of the season may  be preserved in the enjoyment of good  health, I remain    Your Brother in the Gospel of Christ,    Andrew Jenson    Andrew Jenson  Dec. 18 '94

 L. D. S. Historian's Office,    P. O. Box 1678.    Salt Lake City, Utah, June 5, 1894    President Wilford Woodruff    Dear Brother    The enclosed letter signed  by Charles M. Jeppson, A. C. Thomsen and  Mads Nielsen, of Pleasant Grove, Utah Co.,  was handed me this morning by Elder  George Reynolds for answer.  By way  of explanation I will say that I paid  the means referred to strictly according  to the written instructions of the late  Thomas Andersen, and happily I am still  in possession of the original documents  authorizing me to do as I did.  The late  Thomas Andersen never as much as  intimated that I should pay any or all  of it to the Pleasant Grove ward: I was to  pay it to the Trustee in Trust of the  Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,  to be used by him according to his  judgment for the benefit of the Church,  If he should decide to use part of it for  the benefit of the Pleasant Grove first 
 Ward, I have no objection; but certain  it is that the donor of the means never  exposed himself to me to have this done;  nor do I recollect that any of the admi-  nistrators hinted at such a thing until  after I had paid over the means as  directed in writing by the late Thomas  Andersen.  After the death of Bro. Andersen  I paid $150 to each of two heirs, children of  Bro. Andersen, and in doing so, I took  pains to ask both of them (one of them)  the husband of an heir if they had any  objections to the remainder being paid over to  the Trustee-in-trust, as directed in the  written document, signed by the late Thos.  Andersen, which I read to them. Both  expressed the desire that his request be  complied with; and it was done accordingly.  I have always known what to do with the  money, the statement to the contrary not-  withstanding.  When I paid the money to  the Trustee-in-Trust, I agreed to shoulder  the responsibility I repeat now that I am  responsible for my actions in this matter, and  you need not be troubled anymore concer-  ning it.  With the highest esteem I remain,    Your Brother in the Gospel    Andrew Jenson. 
 Historian's Office, Oct. 1, 1897.  To The First Presidency And Apostles.  Dear Brethren:-    In response to your request that I should prepare   a series of tracts for missionary purposes, as suggested by the   brethren in charge of the British Mission, I have written twelve   tracts which I believe will meet the neccessities of the times in   that particular.  After entering upon the work I thought it better   to continue and complete the series uniformly, than to cull from  other pamphlets or to mix in other tracts.  This set will make a   series of twelve tracts of four pages each, and will introduce the   First Principles of the Gospel, the Apostacy, the Restoration, the   Authority of the Priesthood, the Book of Mormon, Baptism for the   Dead, the Establishment of Zion, the Work Performed by the Saints   in Utah, etc., in consec^u^tive order, one tract leading up to those   succeeding.  I believe they will be found suitable for distribution   in any of the Missions.  I hold them at your disposal, and if you   see fit to refer them to any person or committee for review, I shall   be pleased to submit them, and assist in their inspection if you so   desire.    Very respectfully yours,  C. W. Penrose 
 Bro I Goddards Court    E 2nd South    May 26/93    President W. Woodruff    + Council    My dear Brethren/    I was pleased and gratified  with my short interview- with you on  Tuesday, especially in reference to the  subject of Temperance you kindly called  up for remarks.  I listened attentively to the  position taken by Bros George Q Cannon, and  Joseph F. Smith, and since then, having had  some reflections bearing on the same, will  you kindly bear with me while I express  them and give them that consideration  their importance deserves.    After an Elder has been advocating the Word of  Wisdom, would there be any impropriety for  him to submit a simple test with a view of  finding out how many of his congregation  were brought under conviction, and were 
 willing to bear testimony to the same, by  signing their resources to an obligation,  promising to abstain from the use of Tea,  Coffee, Cigarettes, Tobacco, + Intoxicating drinks,  and the use of meats, only in moderation.  Some of all ages would sign such a pledge  in every congregation, a card of membership  should then be given them, and their names  entered in a book,called,say ["illegible"] 1 Division  Another appeal should then be made to the  same congregation for those to sign  another pledge, promising to abstain from  the use of "Tobacco and Strong drink," a  card should be given to them as members   of No 2 Division, of the Latter day Saint  Temperance Society.  When that is done,  ask all the members of both division to  arise and I venture an assertion that in  many instances the great majority of the  congregation would arise.  I cannot imagine any other effort that  could be made, that would lead to such 
 glorious results.    Religion without morality is  simply a farce, and the thousands  of professing Latter day saints, whose  daily habits of life, being in direct antago  -nism to the Word and Will of the Lord,  certainly calls aloud for some mighty  effort, to stem this torrent of iniquity.  Strong drink the fascinating dram, and   Saloons and Gambling hells, the rendezvous,  where all kinds of evil, such as fighting,  stealing, whoring, sabbath breaking +c +c  are concocted.    If any direct effort can be inaugurated  to dry up in our community these hell  traps, so that our youth can be successfully  brought up without their contamination,  happy will those be who take an active  part, and all who countenance and lend  their influence in that direction.    Your Brother    George Goddard
