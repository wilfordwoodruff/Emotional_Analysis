 610 Mar 24  8Pres. W. Woodruff and CounselorsSalt L. City Utah Dear Brethren:Your favor of the 22nd inst to hand in which you ask two further question relative to the stand I took on the county seat proposition, the first is:  When I originally endorsed the movement was I not acquainted with the arguments I now use, and if I was, who did I at first countenance the effort.Replying to this I beg to say that I do not wish to be understood as originally endorsing the move, but after considerable agitation by[ illegible] our citizens I did consent and took part in appointing a council to simply investigate what could be done and whether as it ^was^ contended by some to say as a absolutely [clear] legally, and to report their findings before any definite action should be taken, but that I at first countenanced the action of [illegible] I most explicitly deny.After this committe has made their report I can [illegible] the approval by 
 technicalities [illegible] though we might perchance surmount[ illegible] an expense that I felt [illegible] would ^be^ [illegible] to incur.  I had also by this time made a [illegible ] of the [illegible ] we might reasonably expect in our favor, which demonstrated to me it was better to drop the matter for the present as[illegible]Your second question was, why I declined to give those interested the reasons for any change of base.I [illegible] to say as before that stated, that I had not changed my base, but that I invited some of the members of this community to meet me at my office at a given time, that I might give them my [illegible ] in this matter, they however invited othersnot of our faith and who had previously proven [illegible ] to our people to offend and while those [illegible] were all presentI did not feel at liberty to speak as freely on the subject as I otherwise would have done.  I was there and then in my own office indirectly accused of being bribed by one of our own brethren in the presence of a roomfull of those interested, 
 left the office before I had an opportunity of speaking to him as freely as I otherwise would have been pleased to do.  These brethren are the facts in the case as far as I am able to tell them at present.  If however there is anything further that you wish to ask I shall be pleased to answer them as far as I am able.  Awaiting your further pleasure I remainYour [illegible]T. E. Ricks

 President Wilford Woodruff S L City Sept 12th, 1885.In exile for the Gospel —Beloved brother & Friend — Feeling how poor a correspondent I am not only to you but to all my friends lately, I will try to pen a few lines — a moments reflection will remind you that to keep along I have to do considerable that would be done by others who are absent if they could have liberty to be at their posts and do their parts. I feel thankful that I have my liberty as yet and also feel disposed with pleasure to do all I can to promote the interests of the work in every way I can. I was sorry to hear of the swelling of your feet, an acquaintance of mine who was affected the same way drank freely of celery root beer for a few days and it left entirely.Great interest is felt by many as to the approaching term of Court which meets next Monday. Hopt is the first for trial if a Jury can be obtained - then Brs. Jno Sharp, H. B. Clawson & H. Dinwoody are set for the 28th of this month and after them 18 other cases of [Po]lygamy & Cohabitation. There is much speculation as to how [text faded] first three cases will go, thinking that as the go, others will[text faded] likely to follow. Somethings have been fixed up so that if 
 good faith is kept our brethren in Arizona and all those in Detroit will feel the benefit of it shortly.  It is not best to know too much about some of these things.Our affairs in Mexico have been looking very encouragingly until a day or two since a telegram arrived as follows "Contract failed — proposition was withdrawn. We start hometonight."  Thus it looks as if that cup was dashed from our lips.The President, Bro. G. Q Cannon & L. J. Nuttall were well and joyful in the Lord only a few evenings since.My son Franklin expects to start for Washington soon to see if another case can be got before the U. S. Supreme Court for another decision by them.  Your letter from Ashleys Forkwas read by the presidency and by John H. Smith, who start--ted day before yesterday to visit those settlements in company in company of Prest. A. Hatch in hopes to regulate some of those matters. It is not yet determined whether the semi-annual ^Conference^ will be held, or if so, where?  The work goes on goodand strong in the Logan Temple, and without cessation,generally over 100 daily.Last week we got off a reinforcement of Elders with President Wm M. Palmer to the N. Western States — and last week and this we have got off companies to the Southern States and expect to send 20 more early in next month to Bro. Morgan's aid yesterday and day before 3 cases from Heber City were before the Commission & 2 were sent to the Grand Jury, so the work goes on,with an occasionable lull. We have just had a heavy quiet rain that has turned to snow on the Mts. and has greatly cooled the atmosphere and exchanged deep dust for mud.Bro. Jaques will inform you of your family as he is better posted than I am as to their condition. I hope your enemies may not find you & that your health may be preserved unto you with much comfort of the Spirit to cheer you in your loneliness.Your brother in the Everlasting Covenant  F. D. Richards. 
 Prest. W. Woodruff  S L City  Feb. 18th 1886In ObscurityDear Brother. I am thankful to learn this mor-ning that you are still unfound by your hunters.On hearing some one say that papers had beenseen in Mchands of an officer the day the searchwas made here -- (Feb 8th) I enquired it out and thismorning am furnished the following, by brotherWilliam Chinerell. He says that br. John Barrell, thebrother of Charles Barrell whose family live in the base-ment of this Historian Building, was present when theofficers came to their door and demanded to knowby what authority he undertook to make the searchupon which the officer, who he says was Capt Greenmantook from his pocket five papers one had the name ofJohn Taylor on its outside, another had Geo. Q. Cannon anda third had W. Woodruff, but the other two he did not getto see the names they bore. By this you see how nearlyyou came to having the paper served on you.Yesterday afternoon I went in company with J. H. SmithH. J. Grant, & J. W. Taylor and visited Prest. Geo. Q. Cannon, who 
 his residence at his farm. The doctors Anderson& Young, had dressed his wounds & he had slept abouttwo hours & felt nice bright and joyful on seeing us.He conversed freely, but we rather carefully avoidedmaking conversation so as not to weary him too muchHis face is somewhat marred just more but the doctorsthink it will so heal as not to be much scarred.We spent one hour or so with him anointed & blessedhim. His family were all in the City and before theInquisition by which they ^officials^ endeavor to make all theycan against him.Fairchild (E. L.) went on his way. We learn by a letter from him dated at the Palace Hotel ^San-Francisco^ of his safearrival at that place. Hill & Arnold went on toCalifornia. Bro Cannon's whole affair seems very strangebut the facts are that his departure was known and hewas given away right at the start.Br. Henry Dinwoodey is having a very interesting timetoday in the Court. It appears that what was donein his case yesterday has to be done over again andprobably ^in^ another way. I hope  you may successfullyelude your pursuers still. F.M.L. & B.Y. are inhiding but I know not where. I hear from them occasion-ally. I am still thankfully your brother in the GospelF. D. Richards. 
 Lewis Allen Esqr S L City Feb 20 1886Dear BrotherE. S. Fairbanks S. H. Hilland O. P. Arnold are said to have been with Br. Cannonwhen the letter was arrested. Fairbanks is supposedto have had with him twelve thousand dollars, withwhich to make a payment on the purchase of aplace which the brethren in Chihuahua had con-cluded to purchase of Signior Campo, if I recollectright.John H. Smith is down with Rheumatism, B. Y.and F. M. L. keep hid. Prest Taylor was well thelast I heard of him. I had a letter from him today.Your warm friend Ezra T. Clark send his very kind re-membrance to you and wished me to say that he wouldcome any night whenever you say & take you safely to hisplace where he can keep you securely from knowledge ofothers & he will esteem it a pleasure to do so whenever youwill let him know.I want to know what you have to say about lettingbrother Andrew Jensen have the free access to all the books and 
 records in the office as he wants. It has notseemed proper to me to permit it. He asked for theprivilege to examine and verify some dates whichI told him he could do, but I find that he means theliberty to examine every book case & get everythingand everything that he may wish to find & plunderit for his private interests, and to make his paperinteresting. I shut him off and told him plainlythat I could not permit it. That he must have libertyfrom you or Prest Taylor I before he could be permittedto have free access to the office and all it contains.Will you please give me your views when youwrite again so I may let him know what to dependupon.No more now oh yes Bro Cannonrested well last night & was not quite so [overpligued]as the night before.Goodbye & the Lord preserve youYour Brother in ChristF. D. Richards. 
 S. L. City,  11 Sept. 1891Presidents W. Woodruff, George Q. Cannon, and Joseph F. Smith.Dear Brethren:Brother Martin S. Lindsay,who works in the Historian's Office,desires an increase of his pay. Henow receives for his services $2.50 perday, which is about $65.00 permonth.He is a steady and trustworthyclerk, and has worked in the Histo-rian's Office seven years. He hasassisted to emigrate members of hisfamily from Great Britain, and has been struggling to secure him-self a home in the city. Hemanifests a good degree of faith-fulness and efficiency.In view of the foregoing 
 we unite in respectfully recom-mending that his pay be increasedto seventy five dollars per month.Your brethren in the Gospel,F. D. Richards,John Jaques. 
 S L City  July 12, 1895To Presidents Wilford Woodruff, Geo. Q. Cannon, & Joseph F. SmithDear Brethren—In accordance with your appoint-ment of May 6, of Elders F. D. Richards, Moses Thatcher, Seymour B. Young, and J. Jaques (the last namedappointed in place of L. J. Nuttall, absent) to considera number of cases appealed from various Stake HighCouncils, we would respectfully report that, owing to illhealth, Elder Thatcher could not sit in committee toconsider all the cases, but, according to your laterappointment, Bishop R. T. Burton succeeded him, and sat in committee on and after June 21. We have carefully considered and reported to you on all thetwelve cases referred to us, and have sent you our findingsand recommendations upon them, with the respectivedocuments appertaining. Having therefore con-cluded the work that you set us to do, we hope andtrust that our labors will prove satisfactory to you.Respectfully your Brethren in the Gospel,F. D. Richards.on behalf of the Committee. 
 President Wilford Woodruff  S L City  June 14, 1889My Dear Sir,I have the pleasure to report thatthe work of translating the Book of Mormon intothe Jewish language, which was commenced bybrother Edward Isaacson on or about the 4th of May 1888, is now stated by him to be complete. Hedelivered to me the last sheets on Saturday the 8thof this month, and said it was as well and correctlydone as he was capable of doing it considering his limitedacquaintance with the English language.To make the best of this work possible within mypower, Brother Morris Behrman has assisted me torevise the work by reading the translation to me inEnglish, by which means we were enabled to make fre-quent corrections, but I think the work must havea much more careful and thorough revision thanwe are capable of giving it before I could consent toits publicationThe translation occupies a thousand pages ofknickerbocker tablet paper and has the appearanceof being tolerably well written.The amount paid br Edward Isaacson for 
 translating the work is eight hundred and fifteendollars ($815 00/100). That paid to brother Morris Behrmanfor assisting in the revision of it is five hundredand ninety ($590 00/100) dollars.Respectfully submitted with the earnest hopethat it may not be long till we can see our way clearto have this work published and sent abroad unto allthe House of Israel.Yours in the GospelF. D. Richards. 
 S. L. City, U. T.Prest. Wilford Woodruff  July 17, 1889Presidents Office Salt Lake CityDear Brother. Sometime last October BrotherMoses Peterson who was living at Moab, EmeryCounty in this Territory informed me that ashort line previous he had fallen in companywith a stranger who was traveling through theTerritory, and who in conversation informed himthat on a previous occasion as he was passingthrough with a team (if I recollect right) he foundby the way side a Record Book containing variousmatters of what might be of interest only to theone who had lost it & stating ^also^ that the namesof several of our leading men were contained init.Brother Peterson further stated that this manoffered to return the Record if he knew who toreturn it to and gave Br. P. his name & addresswhich is "N. S. Batcheller. Freedom, Lasalle Co Ills."On the 15th of last October I addressed a note to MrBatcheller as above permitting him to send it to thisaddress & offering to pay the necessary expressage buthave received no reply. Most truly F. D. Richards. 
 President Woodruff. S L City  March 21st 1889.and Council—Beloved Brethren—I think I ought to informyou of our progress in the translation and revisionof the Book of Mormon into the Jewish Language.Last Saturday—the 16th inst—brother Isaacsonhanded in anstalment of the translation thatextended to page 459 of the last English Edition, whichleaves 164 pages to complete the translation. He sayshe will have it finished by the last of April, ashe does quite regularly four pages each day.Concerning the Revision—Brother Behrman & Iare pursuing this part of the labor, by his reading thetranslation back to me in English thus noting andcorre[c]ting all apparent defects to the best of our ability, &expect to have our part accomplished about the sametime as the translation will be.Although we are doing the best we can at this, stillI am desirous that some more competent test shouldbe applied than we are able to give it.In this connexion I would ask—Is it not timeto consider the necessary arrangements preparatoryto the printing and publishing of this work, which, 
 on account of it being in another languagemay require time to order the necessary type,paper, &.c. and this may be attended withdelay—In view of all the circumstances I deemit deem it important to present the conditionof the work before you in time to providefor a further revision if advisable and toprevent unnecessary delay in procuring thematerial for its publication.Respectfully submitted,F. D. Richards. 
 HISTORIAN'S OFFICE, Salt Lake City, Feb. 20, 1896.To President Wilford Woodruff and Counsellors.Dear Brethren:In accordance with your instructions we have considered sister Sorenson's Manuscript on "What Women should Know".We have not undertaken to correct errors of spelling, punctuation, grammar or idioms, or the arrangement of sentences and paragraphs, as we have not supposed that to be required of us.There are many good things in the work, useful for married people to know. We regard it as a work for professional medical and surgicalmen and women, midwives and nurses, and for married people, and notfor lying around loose on the table, accessible to boys and girls, and therefore not appropriate for the most general circulation and perusal,as it contains specific details concerning procreation and parturition,with minute descriptions and measurements of woman's genital organs,and ^their^ environments.Although apparently a midwife and nurse of considerable experience, yet the author talks with the ardor and somewhat of the dogmatism ofa new and zealous convert, and is rather strict and rigid, indeed witha tendency toward radical extremes in the advocacy of the views of her 
 new and special school of the healing doctrine, art and practice,regarding food and abstention, dis[4 illegible letters]^car^ding tonics and stimulantsand almost all medicines, and relying on water treatment, massage, and the healing forces of nature almost entirely, but including faith and priestly administration.Of course many nurses, midwives, medical and surgical^,^ and other people of age and experience, will not accept her exclusivedoctrines and practice, at least not fully. Therefore we considerthat such a professional treatise and text-book, designed to be urged upon the sisters very generally as of undoubted authority,should, before publication or printing, be submitted to a competentcommittee of men and women in the medical and surgical professionsand business, in order that the book, when published, may not be one-sided, and may have greater weight with the people whom its contents so much concern, and greater claim on the patronage of those who will be expected to purchase and use it.We remain,Very respectfully your brethren in the Gospel,F. D. Richards,John JaquesA. milton Musser 
 Salt Lake City, June 25, 1895.To Presidents Wilford Woodruff, Geo. Q. Cannon,and Joseph F. Smith.Dear Brethren -- In the case of JamesPolson and Christian A. Christensen, the latter chargedwith removing and taking possession of 130 rods of fencebelonging to the former, in August 1892, we are unableto affirm ^recommend the affirmation of^ the decision of the High Council of BannockStake, or of the Bishop's Court of Basalt Ward. Whetheror not Brother Christensen (with his son, then under age)did wrong in removing the fence depends upon whetherhe or Brother Polson owned the land, and where theproper boundary line ran, which latter questionswere not of a kind to be settled by Church Councils,but by competent legal authority. The records beforeus do not show these questions satisfactorily.Brother Christensen objected to the juris-diction of theChurch courts on questions of land titles and bounda-ries.  We have no minutes of the proceedings ofthe High Council, excepting their decision affirmingthe decision of the Bishops Court, to the effect thatBrother Christensen replace the fence in as goodcondition as before, by July 1, 1894, or be disfellowshipped.We do not know on what the High Council basedtheir decision, other than the minutes of theBishop's court.  Brother Christensen was not inattendance, being at Smithfield. If the fenceas on Brother Christensen's land, he had a right to 
 remove it, but not to appropriate it. If it was onBrother Polson's land, or on the dividing line, thenBrother Christensen had no right either to removeor appropriate i the fence, and should make restitution,if he has not done so.  We therefore recommend that thecase be referred again to the High Council of the Bannock Stake, and that it would ^be well^ for a committee of arbitrationto consider the matter, especially with reference to the actuallegal ownership of the land on which the fence stood, andthe location of the boundary line or lines thereof, thosequestions being the basis ^for the settlement^ of the whole case.Respectfully Your Brethren in the Gospel,F. D. Richards.R T BurtonSeymour B YoungJohn Jaques. 
 S L City, February 13th 1890Presidents Wilford Woodruff, Geo. Q. Cannon, and Joseph F. Smith.Dear BrethrenYour esteemed communication, inclosing one from Brother AndrewJensen, would have been answered sometime ago, had not illness prevented a due consideration of the subject, which wehave carefully and prayerfully canvassed.There is, in Bro. Jensen's "HistoricalRecord," a large amount of valuablehistorical information, and we thinkhe is entitled to much credit for hiswork on the same.He now offers to turn over, as a free giftto the Church, his "Historical Record," subscrip-tion list, good will of the concern, &c.,with certain historical manuscriptswhich he has written.So far as this donation proffered isconcerned, abstractly considered, it is anact of generosity. 
 But to this proposition another is at-tached, which is that he be taken into theemploy of the Historian's Office, and thislatter proposition, in its various bearings,has caused the most anxious thought.He manifests great desire to pushhimself into the office. It appears tous to be a decided case of the man seekingthe office, which is not the best of recom-mendations.He offers to work either with or withoutpay, but in fact he by no means expectsto work without material compensation. He himself says he considers he is worthyof his hire. We understand that hewould expect compensation, whichof course would be a reasonable expecta-tion, if he was employed in the Historian'sOffice. This part of his offer leads usto think that he has an ax to grind.He offers to work either in the officeor to travel. In conversation, however, at various times, he has repeatedly saidthat he does not want to sit in theoffice and work regularly day after day, 
 President Wilford Woodruff  S L City  March 16, 18890Dear Brother-Bishop [Pleasant Green Taylor|P. G. Taylor of the HanisvilleWard of Weber Stake, informs me that several mem-bers of his ward, among others five of his sons, have en-tered lands in Idaho, previous however to the latedecision of the U. S. Supreme Court declaring the Idahotest oath constitutional.With this new feature added to their politicalstatus the Bishop desires to know how to advise thesepeople of his ward. He says they, and espectially hissons, will not allow their names to be erased from thechurch record in order to prove up their claims, thatthey will relinquish their claims to the land ratherthan jeopardize their standing or place themselvesin any doubtful position in their relations to the church.The answer to Bp. Taylor's question is not onlyapplicable to his people, but it becomes a matter of suchgeneral importance that I do not feel prepared to answerit myself, but think it should be decided by the First Presidency for the benefit of all those who are similarly situated.Your early answer to this will be highly appreciatedas quite a number are waiting to act in accordance 
 with your conclusion.Brother Taylor also desires your instruction inthe following case that exists in his ward:A widow -- Sister Keyes -- whose husband diedabout a year and a half ago, has five living childrenand one dead by this man. Although they weresealed in the Endowment House because she refusedto be married in any other way, it was not long tillhe declared his utter unbelief in the ordinances theyhad received together, forbade her and the children toattend meetings, became exceedingly profane, cursedGod and the ordinances and his wife for correcting thechildren, refused to pay tithing or to aid the poor inany way notwithstanding he was labored with inpatience and longsuffering. He had no faith in a hereafter or that he could have his wife and childrenin a life to come.Since his husband's death this Sister and her children attend meetings and Sunday schools, andBp Taylor says she has been always a faithful andexemplary woman, and she wishes to be released fromher deceased husband with liberty to be united to somerighteous man according to the order of the Gospel, andhe thinks she ought to have that privilege.Very truly your brethren in the GospelF. D. Richards.

 Salt Lake City, Feburary 19, 1895.Presidents Wilford Woodruff, Geo. Q. Cannon and Jos. F. Smith.Dear Brethren:Your Committee, to whom you referred the considerationof Elder B. H. Roberts' new work entitled, "A New Witness For God",respectfully represent that they have read it with great care, and be-lieve it to be a valuable addition to our Church literature. Theyfind nothing therein calling for adverse criticism, but to the contrarythere is harmony in its chapters, which gives much strength to itsarguments, all of which point directly to the evidences, first, of theneed of a new witness for God, and next, that Joseph, the Priophet, wasthat witness. The truths are emphasized on lines of reasoning, dif-ferent from those common to our Elders, which carries to the work a freshness and an interest that will, we think, attract students, anddevelop oin our youth and others an increased love for the study of thegreat latter-day work. Brother Roberts' work collates and condensesa large amount of useful and important information, historical andtheological, which is often not readily accessa^i^ble to the Elders andmembers of the church, but which tends to broaden their views and 
 enlarge and enlighten their understanding of various vital mattersconnected with the Gospel of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.We are also of the opinion that it would be a valuable work topublish to the world at large, as setting forth and sustaining thefundamental truths of the work of the Lord in this last dispensation.Respectfully and affectionately,Your Committee,F. D. Richards.John Jaques.Geo. ReynoldsWe have also read, revised and approved the Manuscript of ElderF. F. Hintze, submitted at the same time as the Mss. of Elder Roberts.F. D. R.J. J.G. R. 
 Salt Lake City, June 18, 1895To President Wilford Woodruff, Geo. Q. Cannon,and Joseph F. Smith.Dear Brethren, Your committeehaving carefully considered the case betweenThomas Broadbent and J. C. B. Jensen, heardand determined by the Bishop's Court of the ElsinoreWard, and subsequently by the High Council of theSevier Stake, have reached the conclusion thatthe decision of the Bishop's Court, as later affirmedby the High Council, is not justified by the evidenceof the record.To our minds the conclusionthat there had been one definite understanding betweenthe brethren named as to the use of the roadway overthe land claimed by Brother Jensen is not war-ranted by the evidence in the case, the testimonyshowing clearly that a larger quantity of land be-longing to Brother Thomas Broadbent had beenand is still used for waste water-way for the benefitof Brother Jensen than that used for a roadway byBrother Broadbent and belonging to Brother Jensen.That such ditches were beneficially used by BrotherBroadbent himself in no way lessens, in our view,the value accruing to Brother Jensen.It isclearly shown by the record that the roadway wasused previous to the acquirement of the land byBrother Jensen, thus giving an acquired rightto those who used it. One of the witnesses advised, 
 the parties to settle without the payment of theFive Dollars mentioned as the amount demandedby Brother Jensen, and the payment of which wasrefused by Brother Broadbent, saying that he thought,in the use of the necessary lands for waste water-way,that Brother Jensen had the best end of the bargain.To us it appears singular that the High Councilshould have recognized the importance and legalbearings of necessary rights of way for water ditchesover public and private lands, and seeminglyignored at the same time the claims of roads orhighways under similar conditions.The letter of President Seegmiller to Brother Broad-bent, conveying a warning, if not a covert threat, is aremarkable exhibition of the lack of good judgment,and shows, to our minds, a bias that would naturallybecloud his judgment, if not render it of doubtfulvalue.By reason of these findings we are, in this case,unable to recommend the affirmation of thedecision, but would recommend that BrotherBroadbent make the road on his own land, andthat Brother Jensen make the waste water ditcheson his land, provided that can be done withoutserious loss to either party.That adjustment,in our view, would lead ultimately to the most sat-isfactory results, and might remove a bone ofcontention which if continued might seriously injureboth parties and possibly affect, more or less, the general public in that stake of Zion. 
 If, however, that cannot be accomplished without se-riously damaging both parties, or either of them,we would recommend the free use of the existingroad by Brother Broadbent, and are equally freeuse of the existing water ditches by Brother Jensen, theuse of the one kind being in full compensation forthe use of the other.  Five dollars being the amountthat prevented a full settlement heretofore, the chargeof $2000 as damages per year for the use of the road, seemsridiculous to us.We are not able to see that the decision, as rendered by theBishop's Court and affirmed by the High Council, eis atall warranted by the testimony, but, on the contrary,is arbitrary, and is in conflict with the testimony.If settlement of this difficulty can be made on the basisof the use of the road on exchange for the use of the ditchesconveying waste water, that will be in harmonywith and finally accomplish the recommenda-tion of the teachers who so patiently labored on thelines of justice and so persistently urged recon-siliation.F.

 Papeete Tahiti  Sept 10/97To the First Presidency Salt Lake City, UtahDear Brethren - We have been work-ing on Tahiti for one month back.The elders are making an effort to work among the people without "purseor script."  Thus far they have received very kind treatment.  This course con'tbe followed here very successfully so long as the government does notinterfere and I apprehend ittletrouble from that source so longas we attend wisely to our duties.So far as I am able to deter-mine we are making a good impression among the natives 
 Some are becoming quite inquisi-tive and I trust that by the end of a year we shall begin to make a recordamong them, however, I feel thatwe should not despair though wedo not receive immediate response to our efforts.  I note that converts have been made on the various islands wherethe gospel has been taken and I conno reason why this island should bean exception.There is arumor spreading veryrapidly in this part and at theother islands of this mission thatJoeph Smith Jr. the president ofthe Josephite Church will be herein December and remain un-til after April Conference.  WhileI trust that it is only a rumorI fear that the arrival of such aperson will make times lively 
 for us here.  I understand []Mr. Burton the president of the missionhere is one of the most influentialmembers of the Josephite Church andit may be possible that Mr. Smithhas yielded to his persuasion to comehere this being one of their strongestmissions.  They have appointedtheir April conferene to be held atour strongest branch.  Takaroa.  Weare quite anxious to get our build-ing completed there by that time.If you consider it wise we shouldbe pleased to have a person some-what handy with carpenter tools andcan do some plastering as one of fourcoming this fall.The elders in general are progress 
 ing well with the language.I have talked with Maputuand he thinks that the natives areready to subscibe for copies of theBook of Mormon and Doctrine andCovenants.  I feel quite confident that from $13,000.00 to $14,000.00 Chiliancom can be raised in advance for that purpose by giving the nativesreceipts entitling them to a copywhen published.  The time is fullyripe to have these books among themif you intend that they should havethem.  I have allotted the work oftranslation between Elders Chamb-lin, Willey and myself.  We haveaccess to a translation of the French Tahitian grammar and vocabularyand believe with this assistance wecan make a very correct trans-lation. 
 he does not want to be in the office much, buthe wants to have a desk here, so he canhave free run of the papers and documentsin the office, but he would like most of thetime to travel about the country, in andthrough the various stakes and wards, tocollect historical information, with a viewto its publication in his "Historical Record,"or other works. Knowing this to be hischerished ambition, which he seems tothink he was expressly born to realize;the subject assumes another phase, anda very important one.Several questions here arise.Would it be well for the Historian'sOffice to assume to publish a periodical similarto the "Historical Record"?Would it be well for the Historian's Office to employ and authorize BrotherJensen to travel most of his timearound in the various stakes andwards to collect historical data? 
 He is manifestly a man of ambition,who would make much of his authorityand position, and would not be backward in presuming considerably on the same.He would require his regular compensation,and probably in addition would want to be entertained and helped along as a person of some importance and authority, as a sort of Historian's Office missionary; would expect R.R. passes, travelling expenses, recommendations to presidents of stakes,bishops, or other prominent persons in stakes or wards, or a sort of virtual carte blancheto ask local aid in his labors. Whether it would be advisable to establish such a functionary, as an appendage to the Historian's Office, is a serious question, at least unde[r] the present peculiar circumstances.The chief complaint in the case of Milando Pratt was that he liked to be away from the office, except when it suited him to be here. He was so irregular in his attendance that the office could seldom rely on his coming to work at any regular time, no matter how much 
 he might be needed, the habit being a growing one and probably resulting from having been employed at one time in copying at so much per hundred words, and regular hours not being so necessary at that kind of work.But it does not seem advisable to continue, or rather to renew, such desulto-ry and intermittant sort of labor in this office, as it is not pleasant, being difficult to keep track of, and it has a rather loose and demoralizing influence on regularity of attendance in other clerks.There is another light in which Brother Jensen's proposal may be considered. If the offer of his magazine, manuscripts, &c., may be regarded in the light of a bait, or bribe, or purchase, or inducement of employ-ment in the service of the Historian's Office, and of his necessarily continued superin-tendence and management of the "Historical Record," or any publication 
 of the Historian's Office, then it may be con-sidered bad policy and a bad precedent to accept the offer and to employ Brother Jensen, so as to furnish ground for a shadow of claim to such obligation or lien on the office.It would be bad policy for this office to accept of any such offer from any man, if there was coupled with it any obligation,written or verbal, understood or implied, that where the donation went the donor must be also and necessarily continue as a part of it, a tacitly recognized if not essential part of it. Very unpleasant it would be, if it was found desirable at any time afterward, and on any account, to dispense with his services, as he then could and might go about saying what great things he had done for the office, how badly it had used him,and how ungrateful it had been to him for the sacrifice of his own private business which he had made for it and to enter its employ. All such things are possi-ble where a man fails to realize his ambitions. 
 As a regular clerk in the office, to work steadily regular hours at any kind of work that might come along, the same as otherclerks, it is doubtful if Brother Jensen would be much of a success. He does not want to do it if he can help it. That is not his desire. His ambition reaches forth in other directions, and consequent-ly he would chafe and be ill-suited and dissatisfied under the restriction of steady daily clerk work, either routine, or varied by anything that might come along.Furthermore, although he has good qualifications for historical work,yet he is such a persistent pusher of himself and his projects that he soon gets wearisome. He is the kind of man who want to pry into the bottom of everything, to know just what everybody else in the office was doing, and would look into and over their work to find out 
 a valuable qualification sometimes, but at other times very inconvenient, and apt to cause unpleasantness and disagree-able friction. He had a seat in the office for a few weeks some two or three years ago, doing some work of his, so the office has had a little experience in this way.  It is disagreeable to have to snub a man who is too forward in trying to find out what other people are doing and what their immediate business is, though some-times it is worse for him to see and know everything that is going on and being done, whether it concerns him or not.He has long wanted to establish himself where he can have frequent and unrestricted interviews with the authorities of the church, and a manwho is continually wanting and seeking such occasions is likely to become tiresome and troublesome, indeed something of a bore.He is not the kind of man that we are anxious to employ as a clerk,at the present time at least. If it was 
 desirable to employ another clerk in the Historian's Office, one who is less presuming,without such personal aspirations and ambitions to push forward, and who would be willing to do any sort of plain work required any and every day, would be much more suitable to the present condition of things. He ought also to be a fairly good penman, and it would be well if he were a shorthand writer,in both of which particulars we believe Brother Jensen is lacking.If the Church was in more favorable circumstances, financially and otherwiseand the Historian's Office had a larger staff of employes to work more freely and especially on Church History proper, it might have been well to employ Brother Jensen as one of them, but it seems hardly advisable under the present restricted condition of things, as there are in the office but few proper and scarcely any 
 documents to be used, and it is uncertain how long these conditions will continue, or the office will retain its present quarters, or have a roof over it, or to what shifts it will be put for a local habitation.  At present little more than ordinary current work can be done, the main object being to take care of what we have and obtain from time to time, and keep the old ship off the breakers, if possible, while running under bare poles in the storm, rather than to be spreading out sail and unnecessarily increasing work and expenses.The recent decision of the court of last resort, sustaining as constitutional the infamous Idaho test oath, opens the way to the admittance of that territory as a state into the Union with that oath intact, which virtually disfranchised every Latterday Saint in that territory or State.Further, if Idaho can go into the Union with a constitutional plank of that unjust, arrogant, and stringent 
 character, as the Senate Committee recommends, Utah can be admitted with a consitution having the same disqualification, and thus disfranchise-ment of Latterday Saints will be gene-ral and may become universal. To what indignities, expenses, and losses,or into what straits the Church and the people may then be put, is easier to imagine than describe.Then the election just had in this city is likely to have results which will greatly intensify and aggravate the unpleasant-ness of the present condition of things.Besides, if the election of Salt Lake Citycan be determined by fraud, so can the election of any other city in the territory, and probably of some counties, at the will of our enemies, and without disfranchisement by law.  They have now learned how to do these things with facility, and apparently with im- 
 punity, for it seems useless to look to the courts for prevention or redress, as with our enemies it is partisan and persecu-tive business from beginning to end.Moreover the unfortunate and un-expected leaning of the Supreme Court of the United States in favor of pains and penalties for opinions and for con-science' sake, as manifested in the late decision, renders it probable that any week we may hear of the confiscation of the property of the Church being sustained by the same court, which would be likely to leave the Church in an ex-tremely awkward situation.Considering all these things, especially the present and probable financial and political conditions, we are more than ever convinced that it would not be well to accept Brother Jensen's proposition, as it would require considerable branchingout into labors and expenditures at an exceedingly inopportune time and [used]peculiarly forbidding circumstances.A competent, discreet, and trustworthy 
 clerk of all work, rather than a specialist, is the best kind to have in the Historian'sOffice now.As Brother Jensen represents that he is able to carry on his publication as a private business, support his family, and pay his bills at the "Deseret News" office, it seems to us, that it would be well for him to con-tinue to do so. If at any time the Church should desire the use of any historical information which he may have gathered, it could probably be had for a reasonable remuneration.We have herein given our views on the subject frankly and at large, looking solely to the best interest of the office and the Church, in the present condition of things, at the same time not wishing to detract in the least from the credit due to Brother Jensen for the work he hasdone. In some respects we regret 
 that we cannot return a more favorable answer. But we have endeavored to take a broad and just view of the subject, bringing probabilities also into account, as requested in your letter.Finally, whether you decide to decline or accept Brother Jensen's offer, we shall be happy to do all we can to further your wishes.We remain Your brethren in the GospelF.

 Salt Lake City, August 12, 1896To Presidents Wilford Woodruff, Geo. Q. Cannon and Jos. F. Smith.Beloved Brethren in the Lord:-In reply to your letter of June 19th,1896, covering a Resolution of the High Council of Salt Lake Stake,concerning which an action of the Apostles was desired, I desire tostate, that on Tuesday the 7th day of July, the Apostles were togetherin Council (except Moses Thatcher, A. H. Lund and A. H. Cannon), andhad the Rsolution of the High Council under consideration.After mature deliberation, it was moved by Elder Brigham Youngand seconded by Elder John H. Smith, and unanimously voted, that,"This Council does not recognize the right of one of our number onhis own volition to go into any organized Stake of Zion, and abrogateand set aside a standing regulation established by the Presidentof the Church, and endorsed by the High Council of that Stake".Most respectfully,_______________, President.________________Secretary.

 Salt Lake City, July 8, 1897.To The First Presidency.Dear Brethren:-The Mss sent to the Historian's office prepared by ElderE. H. Nye, Prsident of the California Mission, has been carefullyexamined.While it contains many good points on the first principles of theGospel, it appears to be too voluminous for popular use as a tract.If the various subjects it treats of were presented under the separateheadings it contains, it would perhaps be better adapted for circu-lation, but even in that case the matter would have to be re-written.As there are now in print many tracts treating on the subjects con-tained in the MSS, the necessity for publishing it does not appearimperative.  In any event careful revision and much labor would be required before it would be suitable for publication.  All of which is respectfully submitted.Your brother in the Gospel, (signature of F.

 May 6 [18]98To the First PresidencyDear BrethrenWe, you committee, appointed to examine the papers in the appeal of Brother Nathan Tanner Jr from a decisionof the High Council of the Weber Stakeof Zion, having very carefully and thorough-ly examined and considered all the papersin the case presented to us, hereby respect-fully report as follows, to wit:The decision of the High Council appearsto be fully justified by the evidence.1st It is clear from the testimony, as wellas the statements of both the accuser andaccused, that Nathan Tanner Jr. owes andshould pay to Annie Pingree Tanner, hisdivorced wife, the sum of $125002nd The second charge in the complaintwas properly dismissed, the amount of $20 00claimed by the accuser having been paid to her father 
 3rd the accused is under moral and re-ligious obligation to provide a home andsupport for his divorced wife and the threechildren which are his, and that this maybe secured to them he should deed to AnniePingree Tanner, in trust for those threechildren, the home they now occupy orsome equally suitable property, and fur-nish them a milch cow with feed andthe sum of four dollars per week in money.With the proviso that this may be modifiedas decided by the High Council. The onlydifferences in these terms of the decision andthose admitted to be proper by the accusedare these: He thinks that $2 50 per week asufficient cash amount for a woman andthree children, and the Council decide that$4 per week is the proper amount consideringthe circumstances of all the parties. Also heobjects to deeding any property for the supportof his children, claiming that he wants the 
 place himself and is able and willing tocare for them; while the Council decidethat the children shall be secured in ahome under the care of their mother, andin case of any change in the conditions,requiring a change in the terms of thedecision, the matter shall be determinedby arbitration in the manner providedby that decision. The other part of thefamily of Brother Nathan Tanner Jr. havebeen provided for, it appears, by theproperty deeded to their mother4 th As it is evident from the admissionsand explanations of Brother Nathan Tanner Jrthat he did obtain and furnish to his wifeAnnie an instrument to prevent conceptionand request her to use it for that purpose,the requirement of the Council that heask her forgiveness for doing so seemsvery proper and a merciful dispositionof the matter. 
 In reference to the doubt cast upon the pa-ternity of one of the children by Bro. NathanTanner Jr, the evidence does not bear out theinsinuation in any particular, but showsthat Bro. Tanner's effort to prevent furtherconception, and the birth of the third child,occurred after the alleged improper con-duct of his wife Annie, and that he there-fore condoned the offence if any there wereWe find nothing in the papers submittedto us which justifies the severe and violentcharges against Bishop R.

Hyde departed for Europe, he called at my office, informed me of his intended departure, andstated that it had been his habit while previously in London to attendmeetings and speak, and had administered baptism, and he desired to do what good he could while away. He said it had been suggested thathe call at the President's office, but they had all left for the night, and that he must go that night, or by the early forning train, and wanted to get the letter now; said he had been recommended by Brother Smith to do so. (I understood him to mean President Jos. F. Smith). I then asked him for his recommend from his Bishop. He replied, "Iam a Bishop's Counselor, and have a right to sign recommends in theabsence of the Bishop, myself". I thereupon issued a regular letterof appointment to him as a missionary, bearing date of that day,as ever,Your fellow laborer in Zion,F.D. Richards. 
 56Historian's Office, Salt Lake City, June   , 1896.Presidents Wilford Woodruff, George Q. Cannon and Joseph F. Smith.Beloved Brethren in the Lord:-It is with great reluctance that I feel constrained to ask you for assistance to enable me to discharemy obligations financially, which have been accumulating upon me fora number of years past, during the rail and hard times that attendedand followed thereupon.This indebtedness, which now amounts to $575000./ has not accruedthrough any misadventure of speculation or trade, but has come aboutby the continuous necessary expenses of myself and the dependant por-tions of my families. I have not expended one dollar in mining, norhave I received a dollar from any mining interest.During the period while Government was plundering the Church, Ifelt to bear my own burden, as all around me seemed to have all theycould carry, and I have patiently hoped against hope, until by the goodprovidence of God, the Government has restored, and agreed to restore,all Church property, real and personal, to its rightful possessor.I was gratified that it was deemed advisable to relieve my breth-ren of the Cannon and Grant Company, and I hope it may be found per-missable to afford me the relief which I now ask, and very much need,to enable me to stop paying interest, and deliver me from financial 
 57-:2:-embarrassment, so that I may preserve my credit and pursue my laborswith a pleasure and delight, which I cannot otherwise do.My Bishop credits me with paying a full tithing; and my fullquoto of offering to finish the Temple.  I have donated fairly to theStake Academy, the Tabernacle, our new Second Ward Hall, Feat-dayofferings, besides many others for the poor.Meanwhile I have observed as rigid economy in my personal andfamily expenditures as I thought consistent with my station in life.If not too tedious, I might allude to the fact that in the midstof my life, while I had the care of Dr. Willard Richards', as well asmy own large families, I had years of distressing sickness to contendwith.  The loss of what little I had by Indians in the Tintic War, whichwith the duties of the ministry, prevented me from establishing myselfin business as some of my brethren have been able to do, and today I have neither Farm, Flock, Herd, or any permanent business from whichto derive any regular income.  But now that my family have become able,most of them, to help themselves, I trust that with the aid herein ask-ed, I may keep my expenses within the available income at presentallowed.While I wish to give all needed information of my circumstances,I desire no needless publicity of them, and shall feel exceedinglythankful for the assistance herein asked.If I may receive one half of the amount named soon, and the other in three months, I believe I shall be able to satisfy the most urgent ofmy creditors- Yours Faithfully F.

I feel well paid for my effort.  I found the people as a whole[ very] kindI was treated to the best they had.

 HISTORIAN'S OFFICE, Salt Lake City, Apl. 2, 1897.President Wilford Woodruff and Counselors Geo. Q. Cannon and Jos. F.Smith.Dear Brethren:The Mss. forwarded from Prof. N. L. Nelson, of the B.Y Academy, has been read and considered.  The length of the treatisehas required considerable time for proper inspection, and is herewithreturned.The Mss. on "Preaching and How to Preach", consists of 715 smallpages, divided into more than 100 divisions and sub-divisions, and hasbesides 500 and odd marginal indices.The following are a few of the captions, etc., over the subjectsdiscussed:"Is there a need for this book?""Parable of the sacred tree"."Ought preaching to be made a formal study among Latter Day Saints?"Answered affirmatively."Preaching no more divine than digging canals"."The fosselized Elder and his sermon"."The brain forming process"."The Goodish Preacher"."The Melody of a Sermon"."As a people we are evidently in love with gliettering generalities"""The cow in the bovine paradise".Specific and not general statements urged."Still grubbing among things earthly"."Scope and range of subjects"."The need of profound study"."The art of thinking". 
 "Founding of ideas"."How to chew and digest what we read"."Etymology of the words "apperception and Apperceptive"."Need of imagery and illustration"."The mind must be a complete court"."Importance of choosing a subject before beginning to speak"."Value of a single subject", urged."Only such subjects should be chosen as are interesting to ^the^ speaker"."Make a mental analysis of your audience"."Triteness and indefainiteness"."Sermons that have departed this life"."We must prepare for preaching"."A much needed revolution"."What missionary sermons should be like"."The need of adopting more popular methods in preaching"."The real value of the doctrinal sermon,- the topical sermon"."Importance of a plot"."Principles and methods of argumentation"."The conduct of a discussion"."Need of persicuity"."How to arouse emotion"."Qualifications of an orator"."Sermons should at least have a beginning (introduction). Middle(discussion), and ending conclusion"."Managing the emotions"."A discourse should contain but one hour's talk"."The need, value and importance of dividing a sermon"."The need of studying grammar"."Preaching as an art"."Formal preaching"."We should be exact, clear and constructive in our sermons"."What becomes of the teacher that does not form the habit ofthinking clearly and consectively?""Rhetoric, elocution, and kindred studies"should be cultivated"."Preaching will be made a study, both as to subject matter andmethod of delivery, just as ( school ) teaching has alreadybeen, and equally good results may be expected"."We should study how to preach"."The Elder speaks from the fullness or emptiness of his own head"."The relative value of oral and written sermons". 
 "The low ebb to which our preaching has sunk, is owing to the oralimpromptu or unstudied methods which have obtained favoramong the Latter Day Saints"."Sermons based on the nature of the congregation.  The age andgeneral intelligence of the hearers must be taken into acct"."Debates and discussions urged, and how they should be conducted"."Sermons abroad and at home".Oratory and kindred qualification, "etc."Sermons should be made up of logical and progressive thought".etc., ad libitum.If the author of the work were a student of some modernsectarian Theological Seminary, its contents would not, perhaps, ex-cite much comment.The work is scholarly and exhaustive; but while the author in-sists that his arguments are in strict harmony with quotations on thesubject of preaching and how to preach the Gospel, taken from standardsources, the Mss. in its explicit and general tenor inculcates theoriesand urges upon its readers suggestions, propositions and methods al-together at variance with the plain intent and meaning of thosestandards. Nevertheless it contains a number of wholesome andseasonable suggestions, well worthy the consideration of thoughtful andprayerful Elders.  Yet, after all, there is nothing in the teachingsof the Savior and his Apostles, ancient or modern, in support of the methods and disipline urged by the author.After a careful review of the Mss, we are of the opinion that itwould not be a suitable work to publish as a guide to preaching, forthe Elders of the church, who are commended to speak that which isgiven them by the spirit, when it becomes their duty to preach and teach.[sideways text] Respectfully submitted F.D.Richards Historian & c.

 115Salt Lake City, August 7, 1896.To The First Presidency:-Dear Brethren:-The propositions of L. A. Wilson in reference to therecording of genealogies and work performed by individuals in behalfof the dead, have been duly considered by the Church Historian and hisassistants and by a majority of the Directors of the GenealogicalSociety, and their unanimous decision is, that it is inexpedient toentrust a work of such magnitude and importance as that proposed, toone person or to any private agency, Nor does it appear from the docu-ments submitted that the evils complained of would be remedied by the scheme proposed.  It would seem more in keeping with the order of theChurch and of Temple Work to place this matter under the supervisionof the Temple Recorders and Presidents.Very respectfully,F. D. Richards-Church Historian, and President of the Genealogical Society of Utah 
 306Historian's Office, Salt Lake City, Sept. 1, 1897.To the First Presidency,Dear Brethren:-Having read and scrutinized the Ms. of a work entitled "Children of God", by Brother Nephi Anderson, of BrighamCity, according to your request, we beg to report as follows:We find no special objection to the story or to the doc-trinal points with which it treats; the style of the work exhi-bits much taste and literary ability, and the descriptive matteris striking and attractive.  Yet we would not recommend the en-dorsement of the authorities of the Church in its publication,as that would make the Church, to some extent at least, responsiblefor its theories, and might be used to urge the sale of the bookin a way that would not be desirable.  We are of the opinion thatpermission might be given to the author to publish the work on hisown responsibility, without the seal of sanction from the Churchauthorities.  We see no harm that could come from its publicationin that way, but concede that it might do considerable good.Respectfully, your brethren,F. D. Richards.J Jaques.C. W. PenroseA Milton Musser 
 Salt Lake City, December 24, 1895.Presidents Wilford Woodruff, George Q. Cannon and Joseph F. Smith.Dear Brethren:-According to your instructions, we have carefully read and considered the Manuscript by Elder Samuel G. Spencer, and herebyrespectfully report, that while it is lengthy for a pamphlet designedfor general circulation, making probably about fifty pages of ordinarysize, it is yet a fair epitome of the doctrines and organization ofthe Church, with the history of the coming forth of the Book of Mormonand the Scriptural predictions concerning it, all fortified by verynumerous quotations from the Old and New Testaments, and likely to beproductive of good, by meeting objections raised against the latterday work.  If it is published, it should be carefully revised for thepress, additional sub-headings interpolated, and some expressions modi-fied.In going over the Manuscript, some suggestions of this kind wehave marked upon it.  The writer has borrowed copiously in the latterpart of the work from the writings of Orson Pratt, but they are made toharmonize with the other parts of the work.We do not think it would be advisable for the Church to issue the

 123Salt Lake City, AUg. 8, 1898.President Wilford Woodruff and Counsellors.Dear Brethren:-In accordance with your wishes, I have heard ElderL. Wilson's Sketch of the Life of David W. Patten read, in company withElders J. Jaques, C. W. Penrose, and A. M. Musser, and we all considerit is an excellent work, and will prove interesting, instructive andedifying to its readers.We would, however, make the following suggestions, which we think would be improvements:Page 4,- "New Movement".  Would not some other expression bebetter?Page 8,- "Patriarch Joseph C. Kingsbury".  He was not a Patriarch then.  Would not the word Elder be better, if any title is given:Page 9,- "Sent to the honest in heart".  Was he not sent toPreach the Gospel to all who would hear?Page 10.- "Patriarch Hyrum Smith".  Same as page 8.Page 11,- "President B. Young".  Same as page 8.Page 24,- "President Lorenzo Snow".  Same as page 8.Page 24,- "Master passion".  What was that?  Is it a goodexpression?

Gowans, of Tooele City, writtento, asking him for a list of the property BrotherPalmer holds, real and personal, so far as itcan be ascertained with reasonable effort.

 Salt Lake City, June 11th, 1895.To Presidents Wilford Woodruff, Geo. Q. Cannon, andJoseph F. Smith.Dear Brethren, In the case of Hannah S.Olsen and Catharine Lewis, of Logan, on appeal fromthe Cache Stake High Council, we find that the evidencepresented appears to us to justify the decision of the Council.Although Sister Olsen claimed that she was willing togive a mortgage on the property in question as soon asshe received the abstract, yet she still refused, even whenher own attorney advised her to give it. We thereforerespectfully recommend that the decision of the High Council be affirmed.We notice in passing that in the hearing of this caseonly five members of the High Council proper werepresent, whereas the Book of Covenants states that sevenshould be present. But, as neither of the partiesbefore the Council in this case took any exceptions orobjected to these facts, our remarks in this connec-tion have a bearing more upon future cases.We remainYour brethren, & c.F.

 Salt Lake City, July 11, 1895.Presidents Wilford Woodruff, Geo. Q. Cannon, and Joseph F. Smith.Dear Brethren, Your Committee have carefully considered the docu-ments presented in the case of Brothers Silas S. Smith and J. P. Haynie,appealed from the High Council of San Luis Stake. It appears thatseveral years ago Silas S. Smith, as a silent and equal partner, put$1000 into the store of Downey and Haynie, of Manassa, the saidDowney and Haynie having previously invested an equal amountcash therein. The store proved to be not a success, said to be largelyowing to giving too much credit, and S. S. Smith wanted his $1000 backwith interest, the other two partners, Downey and Haynie, having drawnamounts from the stores equal to their shares in it, and Smith nothaving drawn anything. The case, by agreement, went before threearbitrators, and also before the High Council, which accepted andadopted the decision of the arbitrators, which decision, as we understandit, was, briefly, That the total amount due S. S. Smith should be held at$1,600, with six per cent per annum interest from date of decision untilpaid, the whole to be paid out of the assets of the Company, and notout of the personal or private property of either Haynie or Downey, andthat J.P. Haynie be placed in possession of said company's property forthe payment of said obligation. This appears to us to be anequitable decision, and we therefore respectfully recommend theaffirmation of the decision of the High Council, with the under-standing of it as here presented.Your Brethren in the Gospel,F. D. Richards.R J BurtonSeymour B YoungJohn Jaques 
 pleased to note that they seemed ready to listen to myremarks on our gospel and appeared to take interest inthe same but my knowlede of the language was not suf-ficient to do any real work in this line.  They [claimed]that we did not stay long enough with them forthem to get acquainted with us and therefore we must not expect them to be taking up with our views.  Ithink this quite true.  I understand from Bro. Cutlerthat this reason in writing the tract just published was tobe able to begin real work here.  From what I gather of the condition of the people throughout the islands I be-leive the tract system will be the most successful and thinkBro. Cutler made a step in the right direction when hewrote his tract.  I beleive there are openings to get the gospel[] in people on this and think to begin with four  
 elders could be [used] to advantage here.  This would allow two elders on each side of the island.  I shall be pleased to receive four elders in addition to those al-ready asked for as early as it will be convenient to get them here.  Tahiti has a population of 10 .113, it is 91 kilo-metres or 114 miles in cirumference.  The City of Papeete a-lone contains 4.288 leaving 5.825 scattered over the restof the island.  With the exception of about 30 miles there isa good road.  This thirty miles is almost impassable and to reach places there one would need to use boats.Perhaps the following statement will be of[ insight] to you.Tahiti has a population of 10 113 and we might [] not been worked.  It is true elders have been on Tahiti and most of them I am informed have visited most of the islandbut it was before they understood the language, as soonas they were able to use the language and in most cases be 
 fore that time, they were sent to the Tuamotus or TubuaiBro. Cutler made an effort but or he was not allowed to use the churches here to speak in he made no further effort in that line but published the tract referred to with the intention of reach-ing the people that way but he returned home by the [] thatbrought the tracts.  Moorea has a population of 1407.  No work has been done there.  The Marquises Group have a population of 4.445 (bysome authorities 7.500)  No work has been done there.  The GambierGroup 508.  No work done.  The Leeward Group about 6.000 no work doneCook Islands 8.000 (per []), no work done.  Rimatara 550, no work done.  Rurutu 730, one saint, 185 days work, Tubuai429, 159 saints, well worked.  Tuamotus 4,743.  905 saintswell worked.  Just over one fifth of these last two islandsare "Mormons".  This shows a population of 35,380 or if [] greater population of Marquises in taken 28,435.  Of* 
 To President W. Woodruff,  S L City, June 3, 1895.Geo. Q. Cannon, & Jos. F. Smith.Dear Brethren - your committee, to whom you referred certain applealed cases from Stake High Councils, for exam-ination and findings, respectfully report the following on the case between the Bishopric of Farmington and Brother T.B. Clark.The record submitted shows that Brother Clark has been disposed, and has made it his practice, to defame the reputation of his brethren, and when urged to make specific charges against those whom he has accused of various crimes has persistently refused to do so, yet has not discontinued his slanderous remarks, but has found fault with the Bishopric for not trying those against whom he will neither make direct charges nor testify.While accusing others, his letters, written over an assumed name, clearly show, in our opinion, the duplicity to which he descended in his efforts to injure the local authorities of the Farmington Ward.In view of these findings, we respectfully recommend that the decision of the Stake High Council be affirmed, and that instructions be given to have the same enforced.  F. D. RichardsMoses Thatcher Seymour B. YoungJohn Jaques. 
 164Salt Lake City, June 25, 1895.Presidents Wilford Woodruff, Geo Q. Cannon, and Joseph F. Smith.Dear Brethren - In the case of Charles G. Parkinson against Bishop James Wrathall, appealed from the High Council of the Tooele Stake, it appears that Brothers Parkin-son and Wrathall and others had sheep in a joint herd, which diminished and eventually was broken up, partly from neglect of the herdsman.  Brother Wrathall went to the herd, claimed and sold the sheep, appropriating them all as his share and then they were insufficient to fully satisfy his claim.  On Brother Parkinson's complaint the case was tried by Bishop Atkin of the Tooele Ward.Brother Wrathall appealed from the decision of the Bishop's court to the High Council of Tooele Stake, which heard the case, and President H. L. Gowans decided that Brother Parkinson was entitled to his prorata of the number of sheep when sold, amounting to 95, and that as Brother Wrathall had looked after the sheep and effected the sale of them no interest on their value from the time of sale should be required of him.  This decision was not sustained by the ^High^ Councillors, the vote being 6 and 6.The High Council reheard the case and decided that Bro-ther Wrathall pay Brother Parkinson 74 sheep at $200 perhead, without interest, to be delivered in 90 days at Grants-ville.  Brother Parkinson thought he ought to have more sheep, and rental or interest on their value from the time of sale.  As no evidence appears to have 
 2been taken at the rehearing by the High Council, we do not see on what grounds the Council reduced the number of sheep to be paid from 95 to 74, nor why they came to render a decision differing from that made at the first hearing.  On the contrary, it seems to us that President Gowan's decision at the first sitting of the High Council should be accepted, in accordance with Doc. & Cov., Sec. 102, pars. 21&22.  As that decision appears to us to have been an equitable one, we recommend that it be affirmed.Respectfully your Brethren in the Gospel,F. D. Richards R T BurtonSeymour B YoungJohn Jaques 
 Salt Lake City, June 25, 1895.To Presidents Wilford Woodruff, Geo. Q. Cannon, and Joseph F. Smith.Dear Brethren - In the case of Bishop Joseph E. Thorn and Samuel Green, sen., against Elijah Mayhew and Sarah Mayhew, of Pleasant Grove, for slander, on appeal from the High Council of Utah Stake, Brother and Sister Mayhew are charged with circulating a statement that Brothers Thorn and Green deposited a load of wheat in the Pleasant Grove Tithing Office about 15 years ago, and the same hour, in the absence of Brother Mayhew, who was the Tithing Office clerk, taking the wheat out of the office and carrying it away again, which, though not impossible, was a very unlikely thing, and was denied by Brothers Thorn and Green.The case was heard by Bishop George Halliday, of American Fork, who decided that the charge was established, there being lack of evidence of the allegedtheft, and that Brother and Sister Mayhew ask forgiveness of Bros. Thorn and Green, or be disfellowshipped.Brother and Sister Mayhew appealed to the Utah Stake, which sus-tained the decision of the lower court.As Brother and Sister Mayhew failed to furnish satisfactory proof of their damaging statements concerning Brothers Thorn & Green, and consequently were in the wrong in circulating such statements, we therefore can come to no other conclusion than to affirm the decision of the High Council, which we respectfully recommend.Respectfully, Your Brethren in the Gospe,F. D. Richards.  R T BurtonSeymour B Young  John Jaques 
 Salt Lake City, June 26, 1895.To Presidents Wilford Woodruff, Geo. Q. Cannon, and Joseph F. Smith.Dear Brethren - Your committee herewith returnthe documents in the case of Elizabeth Palmer and James Palmer, appealed from the High Council of Tooele Stake by James Palmer.It appears that Elizabeth Foxall became second wife of James Palmer 43 years ago, and has had eleven children by him, nine of them now living, the youngest 20 years old. Brother and Sister Palmer, not agreeing, have not lived together for about 15 years.  His first wife is dead.  He has a third wife, Mary Jane Ewer, with whom he lives, and who has had by him 13 children, 10 of them now living with him, the youngest about four years old.Elizabeth Palmer and children have not had support from Brother Palmer for 14 years.  They used to live with him in Skull Valley, on a farm, which he sold several years ago for $9,000, part cash and part real estate, and he thinks he ought to give her and her children part of that means.The High Council approved the decision of the Bishop's Court of Grantsville Ward, to the effect that Brother James Palmer pay Elizabeth Foxall Palmer certain five acres of land and $1000in cash, or $1500 in cash without the land, the landto be deeded to her by Nov. 1, 1894, and the cash to be paid to her by Sept. 1, 1894.After carefully consideringthe case presented to us, we respectfully recommend 
 that the decision of the High Council be affirmed, withthe modification that the land be deeded to her within a reasonable specified time, and, (as times are hard), cash difficult to be obtained, and Brother Palmerbeing 74 year old and having a large young familyon his hands) that he be allowed four years in which to pay the $1000 cash, at the rate of $250 per annumwithout interest, and that Bishop James L. Wrathall, of Grantsville Ward, be requied to make arrange-ments to secure payment of the same to Elizabeth J. Palmer, and that Brother Palmer give security for said payments.Respectfully Your Brethren in the Gospel, F.D. Richards,R. J. BurtonSeymour B. Young John Jaques 
 Salt Lake City, June 27, 1895.To President Wilford Woodruff, George Q. Cannon,& Joseph F. Smith.Dear Brethren, Your committe have considered the case of Alexander Black and W. Henry Hurst against James Lees, appealed from the High Council of Summit Stake.We find that Brothers Black and Hurst and Lees all had made some improvements on a piece of R. R. land, and Brothers Black and Hurst had used, cultivated, and claimed it for years and before it was in the market, but that Brother Lees eventually bought the land of the R. R. Com-pany and secured the title thereto. Brothers Black and Hurst, if they could not get any of the land, wished to be reimbursed for their claims,water right, and improvements, and various offers and attempts at adjustment were made, but without success. Finally Brother Lees required Brothers Black and Hurst to take away their moveable improvements (stables, corrals, & c.)within 20 days or forfeit them. The case was not tried by the Bishop's Court of Coalville East Ward, because one of the Bishop's Councillors was related to Brother Lees, and, to avoid prejudicing the case, it went to the High Council of the Stake, whose decision was adverse to Brother Lees, and a committee of three was appointed by the High 
 Council to visit the premises, investigate the claims and examine the improvements of the parties, and award damages.  The Committee reported that Brother Hurst was entitled to damages amounting to $3350, and Brother Black to $7700, from Brother Lees.The report of the Committee was accepted by the High Council, and approved.  Brother Lees appealed from the decision of the High Council.We consider that Brothers Black and Hurst were entitled to some compensation, and that the amounts stated above are a moderate estimate for damages sustained by them, and therefore that the decisionof the High Council was fair and equitable.Consequently we respectfully recommend that the aforesaid decision be affirmed.Your brethren in the Gospel,F. D. Richards,R T Burton Seymour B Young John Jaques

We have notused any native elders here so far.  I have beenconsidering the matter for several months.  Theislands are so scattered that they could not beused in a near vacinity of their homes.  Theywould need to go hundreds of miles from home onto other islands.

 Salt Lake City, June 27, 1895.To Presidents Wilford Woodruff, Geo. Q. Cannon, and Joseph F. Smith.Dear Brethren - Your Committee have considered the case of James V. Williams and T. L. Quist, appealed from the High Council of Sevier Stake.  This is a question, not of title to land, that not being in dispute, but of value for prior claims, water right, and improvements by Brother Quist, and in part conceded by Brother Williams, to and on a city lot in Monroe.The High Council approved the decision of the Bishop's Court of Monroe Ward,which was briefly that Brother Williams accept $50 from Brother Quist, and give him deed for the lot, or pay Brother Quist $125 within six months, and keep the lot, water-right, and improvements.This decision we consider equitable, and we therefore respectfully recommend its affirmation.Your brethren in the Gospel,F.

Will send you a recept, for all as soon as we hear from Mr. Haner.I feel very much obliged to you for the interest you have taken in this matter and under the circumstances I think you have been very successfulYou were just right in calling in Mrs. [Cowend]for that amount, for she had been there some time and could probably attend to it as well there as at any time,  I think you are a very thorough business man,   you look after them close, they do not escape you quite so easy, but you always use all well and try to do the same to yourself and friends,that I think is just right, a man must lookafter his interests closely in order to accomplish much,  Brother Little was very prompt,  I feel obliged to him, please give my respects to him when you see him,  you succeeded in closing that affair up up with Messrs.

 We were sorry to hear that you and Mrs. Woodruff had been ill, hope you are all enjoying good health now,  I was quite surprised to hear of the death of Sister Webster, I hope that with her to die, was gain.  She always appeared to me to be a very kind, zealous, and good woman.I was really very glad to hear that Miss W.was married for I think she seems to require the assistance of someone more than many others, and I think this Mr Cowand a very fine man. will you please give my respects to her when you see her.I have been in Portland for the past two or three months, and think it probable I shall move my family there by & by, if I should, Freedom and family will probably come here,  Ezra and family are well E. is growing old, is quite gray, he is expecting an appointment under Gen. Pierce, to be the collecter of the customs in Portland.  I think he will get it,it is worth a little more than $3000 per year,Father is quite smart for a man of his age, his mind is failing considerable I can see.  Esquire Southgate has lost four children (all grown) this fall within three month it effects hom very much.Matters here in Scanton are about as usual,no changes of importance, there has been a little interest in religious matters, some few have been we hope converted in [[Gut.  Ira and family are wellCalvin is at home this winter, I think he will be interested in driving stock across the plains this season 
 I had pretty much given up the idea, but you speak so favorably of the enterprise that I now think I may have an interest with Calvin and Mr.Rollins, who will take some cows and young cattle to Cal for a market.  I want to see you very much indeed, and Phebe also, though it seems mostly out of the question and almost useless to think of such a thing.I think I could spend a few weeks with you very agreeably.  We hope to see you here "one of these days"but hardly dare to expect Phebe, for it is a long, tedious,and tiresome journey.  Should you chance to meet brother Bullock please give my kindest respect to him, he was in the [Saluda] at the time of the accident, and ask him to give my respects to Elizabeth.Well Brother and Sister, I am very glad that I have a little news that will interest you.  Moutherhas become a good Christian, it is not the result of my excitement, nor no hasty movement on her part,She has always possessed a very kind an amiable disposition, you know, and been very exemplary in all her walks, but that is not quite enough, for the past year she has been thinking seriously of matters pertaining to her future happenings and God has blessed her in securingan interest in heaven.  by her example I have been inclined to make the effort myself, and I feel that our Father in Heaven has been and is very good to me, my mind has been seriously inclined since that solemn ordinance was administered to me at your place, but my reason since until 
 within some two months since for not more fully embracing Gods blessed promises has been the same as I advanced to you when speaking on the subject.I now think that there is nothing that I so much regret as I do that I had not attended to this important matter much sooner..  If I had had heavenly grace and wisdom to have directed me in all of my business affairs and perplexities through life I think it would have been much better for me.  We want you to pray for us that we may be able to keep all the commandments of God, and that we may at last with all our dear friends enter into that blessed city of the New Jerusalem that God has prepared for all that love himI intended writing a short letter to Phebe, but my engagements will not well admit of it,  I asked Father if he would write her a few lines and I would enclose it with this, I do not know yet whether he will or not, if so I will send with this,Mrs. Carters health has been quite good for the past three months until within some two weeks, since that time she has been rather poorly, our childrenare all well.

 Ms1352bx6fd12#2Nauvoo Oct 27th 1844Dr Brother WoodruffI sit down this morning to send aline to you by brother Benjamin Halkins who leaves here to day tocome to England, but inasmuch as it is conference and a very busytime I can only say a very little.  Since you went away we havehad all kinds of time and some very warm I assure you Es Rigdoncame out decidedly opposed to the Twelve and declares himself abovethem and not responsible.  He held secret meetings at Sobys nightafter night and there ordained a number of men prophets, priestsand kings without any ordinances or authority.  He likewise taughtthem that Joseph was fallen and that the Twelve were corrupt andwicked, engaged in Bogus making and adultery &c &c. &c.  Ths youmay thnk cause a little rupture because in spite of his curringit leaked out and although he told the people in publick thatJoseph died holding the keys of authority he taught them in privatethat Joseph was a fallen prophet and he had known it for years.He said in publisk that he did not want to divide the church, but in private he said he wanted to feel in the minds of the people and if he could gain enough to go with him he should come outpublickly against the Twelve and rout them.  When these thingswere proven to the Twelve some of them sent to see him and finallygot a confession from him which satisfied them that the reports were true.  The consequence was he was cited to appear beforethe High Council in publick meeting for trial, but he refusedto come.  The whole case was investigated and a black catalogueof accusations substantiated against him, and he was cut offfrom the church and delivered over to the buffettings of Satanfor the destruction of the flesh that the spirit may be saved inthe day of the Lord Jesus.  There are a number gone with Es. Rigdon to "the mountains" as he said as to Pittsburgh 
 Amongst those who have gone with him are John A. Forgeus, William Richards from New Jersey, George Morey, Joseph H. Newton, Leonard Soby, Samuel Bennett; Wm" Cottier, George N.Crouse and several others who had scattered agreeable to thefundamental principles of Er Rigdons doctrine.  Jared Carter was cut off with these but he has made a full confession and was voted to be rebaptised.  The above men even all cut off, by the unanimous vote of a large congregation of Saints.James Emmett has drawn off a party and gonesomewhere west but I dont know where.  There are but fewgone with him, but there are enough to go to destructionwith one man for that is there fate.Lyman Wight is about 200 miles above Galena.There was about 40 families went with him but fourof the families got tired and came away at the risk of theirlives.  If the statements of these new are true Lyman isgone to the devil.  He is drunk every day and will not sufferthe men to labor for their bread but he says they must liveon the gentiles so that his company bids fair for beinga real band of "Gadianton robbers."  They leave alreadyconspired to [n...der] three families of traders in theneighborhood when they are but way disapointed.The traders have heard of it and they have circulatedwhen the Indians return (who are now West receiving their annuities) to set them as them and I think there is dangerthats they will suffer.  I give you this as the repast of thosewho have left his party and I am much inclined tobelieve it.  Those who have left Lymans party are JacobNeoooom's,  Merrinus W. Loveland, and his son in lawany my brother David with their families.Now you may well think that after the church hasthus vomited and purged we feel better the atmosphereseems to be a great deal more pure and the Saints 
 feel better.  The mob are still threatening but we dont apprehendany danger.  They had arranged to have a Wolfe hunt on the 27thof last month around Nauvoo and called upon the Missouriansto come and help them.  The object was to surround us and provokeus to hostilities so that they could get some appearance of legalityto either drive or exterminate us.  We sent word to the Governor and on the day the Wolf hunt was to take place he was inNauvoo at the head of about 500 men to prevent the movements of the mobs.  The Governor has made great pretence to [pro...]the Laws and has repeatedly pledged himself to execute themand have the murderers arrested.  The Sheriff went toWarsaw and arrested Sharp but the citizens rescuedhim.  The Governor then gave them to understand that he should have them any how and they finally concluded togive themselves up.  Sharp and Williams and the greatrascal of a Joseph H. Jackson gave themselves up.  the two former were taken to Turkey and there held to bail.  Iwas two near dead to [day ...]We think privately that theGovernor has made a bargain with them and they will getclear.  We esteem the Governor as one of the wards of the moband are well satisfied that he means us no good.  But thereis a God in Israel and he hears our prayers, for we have seenit repeatedly.  God is with us.  He is with the Twelve in all theirmovements and if you was here you would see the months ofthe prophet on brother Brigham very plain.  The church feelwell and we will leave a good conference.  Yesterday was spent in preaching in the morning by [Jon...g] and then afternoon by Er Taylor.  Things look good, the Templemoves rapidly,  There are now ten of the Capitals on the wallsand more will be on this week.  You will hear from thebrethren I suppose and the time is drawing news to go tomeeting and I must close by expressing my warmest loveto you and to all of like faith.

Inthat letter I used the words "ordinary recommend", intending that thatexpression should convey to the minds of the brethren the idea that suchshould be granted subject to the usual provisions and restrictions, orthose members of the church that you could not recommend to the privileges ofits dedication.

 that he knew nothing about military tactics. "I knownothing about them gentlemen, I am entirely igno-rant of them" &c. &c. I remarked we had a good opper-tunity of proving that governor, during the last campaign, our legions have got a first-rate joke on you sir, in what? he asked. I replied, in sending out Capt. Singleton to press take com-mand of the "Nauvoo Legion." He felt a good deal chagringd at me beleiving his own statementrelative to his ignorance; he tried to excuse himself, but only made the matter worse. ElderBrigham Young is now Leuftenant General & all things are going on well in the legion. We have just sent for & obtained 250 United States muskets we have purchased them ourselves & are not depen-dant upon others for them. We are also contem-plating going into the various branches of man-turing & shall be able this winter, we beleive to supply all the different tradesmen with all the work they can do. A few cutlers would be very serviceable here. Several of our storekeeperswho have been enemies are about moving out, & we have general peace. we are going to make our own goods & shall not need them.The church was never in a more properous condition that at the present. [illegible] & every 
 other ism is flating out & peace order & union prevails.  I think that we never had so large an assembly at a conference, & there never was more business transacted in the time nor did I ever see so much harmony nor a greater confidence manifested in the authorities of the church.There were upwards ^about^ 500 I believe ordained into The seventies, & 100 into The High Priests QuorumWe have divided the United States of into different districts & have appointed one or more high priests ro preside in those different dis-tricts, & to take charge of the churches embraced in their several bounderies & to preside at the different conferences that shall be held [illegible]ally at the most convenient point in respective districts:  much the same as the churches are organized in England.  This makes it convenient as the High Priest can report to their presidents, & the presidents to the Twelve,.There are now eleven quorums of the seven-ties organized & filled up, & a twelvth forming, so you will perceive that we have not been idle.  Thefirst seventy have generally been made presidents hence there are presidents over the several seven-ties & a presidency appointed over the whole, so hence the presidents of the seventies can report to the first presidency of the seventies & they to the Twelve. 
 a few business matters & I must close.  I never received one of your "Stars", although I receive every other foreign paper regularly.  Be so kind as inform those persons who send papers to us (for I know not to whom we are indebted for them) to have them directed them to the Editor of the "Nauvoo Neighbor," insted of to John Taylor, as it sanes postage.  Whatever charges there are on those papers I hope you will defray & charge to my [illegible ].

Udall.Preside of St. Johns Stake.Dear Brother:-We extend an invitation to you to be present at the First session of the dedication services of the Salt Lake Temple, to be held on the morning of April 6th, 1893.Through you we also tender a similar invitation to your two counselors; to regular members of the High Council; to the Presidency of the High Priests' Quorum; and to the Bishops and their Counselors.; also to the Patirarchs.The entrance will be at the south gate, which will be open at 8:30 A.M. on the day named.It is desirable that you and those brethren whom we invite through you, should appear at the entrance for admission in a body.All those who present themselves will be required to show recommends.Your Brethren,Wilford WoodruffGeo.

 OFFICE OFThe First Presidencyof the Church of Jesus ChristofLatter-day SaintsP.O. BOX.B.Salt Lake City, UtahJany. 30, 1894.Prest. D. K. UdallSpringervilleDear Brother: - You are hereby authorized to seal Sister Charlotte Webb to Elder Robert Marion Tyler, at the same time advising them to visit one of the Temple at the earliest convenient time so that she can receive her endowments, and they be sealed at the altar. If it should so happen, though it is not probable, that they never have this opportunity, then the ceremony performed by you, under this authorization, will have full force and effect.Replying further to the inquiries in your favor of 19th inst., I will say--A Bishop's Court is authorized to excommunicate from the Church, for cause, lay members and brethren holding the Aaronic Priesthood without referring the case to the High Council of the Stake. Of course the parties excommunicated have the right of appeal to that body. But if the accused holds the Melchesidek Priesthood then the Bishop's Court has authority only to disfellowship him and report its proceedings to the High Council for further action. With regard to presenting the names of those who have been disfellowshipped or excommunicated to the members of the Ward, - this is sometimes done for information, where deemed desirable, but not for the purpose of sustaining or reversing the decision of the court, but there are cases where justice and mercy would both be better served by giving the offence the least publicity possible, and confining the knowledge of the wrong doing to 
 those actually interested and to those who have, by reason of their official position, are obliged to be made acquainted with the facts.Your Brother,Willford Woodruff

This we do [now:] asking the Stake Presidencies to send us with as little delay as possible the names of as many brethren as they consistently can.As a rule brethren over 45 years of age are no able to satisfactorly endure the tolls and vicissitudes of missionary life, but, on the other hand, there are robust, well preserved brethren to be found among us who can do so for a number of years later. In making these selections we shall trust to your good judgment, and that will seek the promptings and guidance of the Spirit of God.With this we enclose blank forms for your use in sending in your lists of brethren suggested for these labors.Your Brethren in the New and Everlasting Covenant,Wilford WoodruffGeo.

 Edwin Evans Aug 8/92,Nibelle France]August 8th 92.Prests. Wilford Woodruff,George Q. Cannon Joseph F. Smith -,Dear Brethren,At present I am out in the country working from nature under M. Rigolot who Bro Pratt has made mention of in his letters to you some time ago.  M. Rigolot is noted for his brilliant sunlights and his clost observance to nature.He is more of a realistic painter than an idealisticone, that is why we appreciate him so much as a landscape teacher. 
 Sunlight painting is taking quite a prominent part in modern French art, and I may justly saythat in this they far excell Artists of an earlier date - probably the greatest reason for this is that the oldMasters did not pay so much attention to Landscapepainting as the modern mendo - Sunlight painting affords an opportunityfor a very brilliant display of colors; but is considered to be lacking in poetry -The artist Corot used to say that sunlight was vulgar.As I expect topaint the country that I live in, and as you are aware Utah is noted 
 for her sunlights, there being but few gray-days and very little atmosphere.I have thought it best to pay especial attention to this branch of landscape painting - I shall remain under M. Rigolot for the balance of this month, and then I will return to Paris and enter the academy for a couple of months, and return to Utah about the first of November - I have not felt able to get out designes for the decorating of the temple,but shall be very glad if I can assist others in executing theirs - I have enough money to last me for about 
 six weeks.  If you can send me Three Hundred and Fifty Dollars ($350,)it will do me while I remain here and see me home.  Bros Pratt and Fairbanks have left for Utah.  Bro Haag is in the Julian AcademyBr Clawson I have not herd from since he left Paris last spring for Rome.I will say before closing that I am wellpleased with the progress that all of us have made while in school and while in the country underM. Rigolot.  Hoping that you are enjoying good health.I am your brotherEdwin Evans 
 P.S. The safest way of sending funds across the plains I think is by drafts or Government funds - I hope all our friends are well please remember me kindly to all..  Should any of them come to the States or to Maine it would afford me much pleassure to have them call on me.The suffering in in huge cities this winter is beyond parallel.Yours in haste I. F. Carter

 as near as I have been able to ascertain it will cost in the neighborhood of Three hundred and fifty ($35000)dollars for me and my family provided I am able to get all the advantages in rates that are usually given to our Elders.  There are a few little things that I should like to get to assist me in the work

I realize the enormity of this request  
 and am sure that you are pressed for means at thistime - yet I am anxious to get back home and to workI feel that the Lord has blessed me greatly in the past and pray that with his assistance to be able to bring forth the fruits of my labors.It is with great pleasure that I am able to say that we are all well and sincerely hope this may find you and yours the same.

 it is very desirable that the meeting be held while the majority of the people from the different stakes who feel interested in this work, will be in the city.At a special meeting of the Board, held last evening, I was directed to communicate with you in their behalf. They would like very much to have the usual meeting but feel that under present circumstances it will not be best to hold any, unless one of  the evenings named, can be secured for that purpose.An early reply will oblige as their arrangements depend on your decision.Your Bro. in the Gospel,L.W.

The letter was read and the contents considered by the Council of Apostles at their meeting yesterday. Apostle John Henry Smith and Bishop Burton being present.The question of the indebtedness of the St. Johns Ward on the St. Johns purchase was considered, and you are requested to furnish us a detailed statement of the indebtedness on that purchase to the Church. You will also please send us your suggestions as to the propriety of building a Stake Academy, or Stake meeting house or Ward meeting house, together with the proposed locations for any of such buildings.It was also decided by the Council of Apostles that the settlements of the Saints on the Little Colorado and its tributaries be maintained, and that the Saints located in those settlements should remain where they have been called, and assist in securing to themselves and to the Saints the locations which have been made, that the Stakes of Zion shall be strengthened and their cords lengthened.

 OFFICE OFThe First Presidencyof the Church of Jesus ChristofLatter-day SaintsP. O. Box. B.    Salt Lake City, Utah.  Nov. 13th, 1891.Prest. David K. UdallSt. Johns Stake of Zion.Dear Brother:We hear that the Constitutional Convention of your Ter-ritory has adopted a Constitution which, without being free from objections,is probably as good a Constitution as is likely to be adopted at any time in the nearfuture.The advantages of living in a State ought to be highly valued by everycitizen. It is true, State government is more expensive; but under thatform the people have the right to govern themselves and to elect their ownofficers, instead of their being appointed at the caprice of politicians.What is the feeling of our people upon the subject? Are they likely tovote in favor of the Constitution or not?It is very important to them that what they do in this matter should bedone carefully, and with due deliberation.Were we living in your Territory, with the knowledge that we have of thesituation, we think we would certainly vote for the adoption of the Consti-tution, because we are of the opinion that the results would be beneficial.Our view is that our people should vote for the Constitution, unlessthere are strong and overpowering reasons of which we have no knowledgewhy they should not.Our object in mentioning this to you is that through inattention orcarelessness the election should not be allowed to go without those whohave the right to vote expressing their views by ballot on this importantsubject. Everyone that has a vote should not fail to express his will 
 2.upon this question at the polls, when the occasion for doing so shall ar-rive.In writing in this strain to you we do so with the expectation that youwill take the necessary steps to bring this matter clearly to the attentionof all who are interested, that nothing may be lost by negligence.The question of holding a general conference of the Stakes in Arizonahas been brought to our attention by Elders John Henry Smith and John Mor-gan, and after conversing with them we are of the opinion that a conferenceheld annually, commencing on the first Sunday in July, would probably be asconvenient for all concerned as any that we know of. We understand thatthe place of holding this conference has been agreed upon by yourself andthe other Presidents of Stakes, and that Pine Top is the place.With kindest regards,We areYour Brethren,Wilford WoodruffGeo.

The apportionment to yourstake is $600.00.   The allotments to the stakes have been placed aslow as possible, and it is necessary that each stake make up its fullamount.We suggest that you and your counselors consider the circumstances ofthe brethren of your stake, and select therefrom as many as are able topay say from one to four hundred dollars each, to complete the House ofthe Lord; and then an appeal be made to them to pay such amounts as youmay deem proper.  This being done you can then call upon the other mem-bers of your stake to make up whatever amount is necessary to completeyour allotment.If the money is paid, say, one half on or before December 15th 1892,and one half on or before March 1st 1893, it will answer the purpose.  Butwe trust you will bring this matter to the attention of the Saints withoutdelay, as there must be no failure in this great undertaking.

After hearing all that was said upon the subject, and espe-cially from Brother Milner concerning his rot having been properly notified,and his willingness to agree to that which was reasonable to make satisfac-tion, we promised him to write to you.  The assurance that Brother Freemangave concerning the willingness of the brethren to pay it themselves ratherthan have any trouble, prompted us to exhort Brother Milner to seek an earlysettlement, as we believed from the spirit that Brother Freeman described asexisting among the Saints who are interested in this case, that it would notbe a difficult matter for Brother Milner to make affairs right if he had thedisposition he should have, as a Latter-day Saint.Brother Milner is a man of peculiar temperament, and cannotvery well be judged by the standard which we expect other men to be measured 
 by; but we believe he desires to retain the fellowship of the people andhis standing in the Church; and while we do not think it would be proper tosubmit to wrong from him, still if you can meet him in the spirit of con-cession no doubt it will have the effect to save him from serious difficultyin connection with his standing in the Church.  The reports we hear of him while in England, written by Brother Teasdale, President of the British Mis-sion, give us a good opinion of his labors while a missionary in England,and this was about the time by your action he was severed from the Church.Trusting you will be able to settle this matter to the satisfac -tion of all concerned,and agreeable to the Spirit of the Lord.We remain,Your Brethren,Wilford WoodruffGeo.

 PRESIDENT'S OFFICE Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.P.O. BOX B.Salt Lake City, U.T. June 20, 1890.Preside David K. Udall and Counselors,St. Johns Stake of ZionDear Brethrens:Shorthly after the last general conference in this city we had one or two interviews with John B. Milner at which Brother Freeman and Brother Crosby of your stake were present; and we became satisfied from all that was said that there had been irregularities in the trial of the case of John B. Milner before the Bishop's court and before the High Council though we did not say so to him. Brother Freeman heard all the conversation and understood its purport, also Brother Crosby - if he is with you still.. We have received the enclosed papers from John B. Milner concerning this case, and we send them to you for your considereation. John B. Milner is a very peculiar man; he has oddities of manner and in his way of doing business that create unfavorable impressions concerning his soundness; but we believe that underlying these peculiarities he has a strong love for the Gospel and values his connection with the people very highly. We do not know why he should have been published as excommunicated as this is not the general custom, and there are many cases more flagrant than his that are no published. We might not however have noticed the publication particularly had it not been that at the time of the appearance of the notice in our papers we had advices from President 
 George Teasdale in England that John B. Milner was doing quite a good work as a missionary in that country, though he had not been sent there as a missionary.We would like you to give this case the fairest possible consideration, and let us know what you have to say on the subject. We would very much like to have this business settled up and this man restored to a standing in the Church if it can be done consistently with the principles of righteousness. In dealing with men we have to take them as they are, and deal more leniently with some than with others because of the difference of their organization and knowledge. The Lord deals with His children in this manner, and we ought to deal with each other in this spirit. A rule we might with perfect propriety apply to one man might not in perfect justice be applied to another.With kindest regards,Your Brethren,Willford WoodruffGeo. Q. CannonJos. F. Smith

UdallSt. Johns Stake of Zion,Dear Brethren:Please let me know by letter or telegram within ten days as near as you possibly can, how many persons from your stake expect to attend the dedication of the Temple in this city. In this estimate you may include all baptized members of the church of every age; children under eight years will be admitted to these services. Without this information the Presidency cannot make the necessary arrangements as to the days the saints from your Stake will have the privilege of attending. It must be remembered that none will be admitted to the dedication without first obtaining  an ordinary reccomend from their Bishop, countersigned, as usual, by the President of the Stake.Your Brother,Wilford Woodruff 
 PRESIDENT'S OFFICE,Salt Lake City, Jan. 24, 1888.President D. K. Udall,St. Johns, Apache Co, Arizona.Dear Brother: - Your letter of Jan. 18th, respecting your Stake Academy, etc, has been received.We will forward your letter to Elder Karl G. Masser, at Provo, with a request that he make you a draft of such a building as you need, so far as he is able to do so.In regard to the rock hauled on Labor [Tithing], for your Stake Tabernacle, to the amount of $331.00, and your wishes to use the same on your Stake Academy, you are at liberty to use the said rock for that purpose.Inasmuch as your High Council has taken action in regard to the fellowship of Brother John B. Milner, it will be proper for you to notify the Presidency of the Stake or the Bishop of the Ward where he now resides, of your action.My health is good, and my time is fully occupied.With kind regards,Your Brother,W. Woodruff 
 PRESIDENT'S OFFICE;Salt Lake City, Feeb. 7, 1889.President D.K. Udall,St Johns, Apache Fo, Arizona.Dear Brother, - In compliance with your request, per letter received Jan. 24th, I enclose you herewith a rough draft of a building for a Stake Academy, with lecture room, as prepared by Prof. Karl G. Maeser, also a copy of so much of his letter which pertains to this subject.I trust this will be satisfactory to you and give you, at least, his ideas of the kind and size of the building you need.With kind regards,Your Brother,W WoodruffPresident Church Board of Education. 
 PRESIDENT'S OFFICE.Salt Lake City, Utah, August 9, 1888.President David K. Udall,St. Johns, Apache Co., Arizona.Dear Brother:Respecting a new Bishop for the Heber Ward, it will be well for yourself and Counselors and the High Council to canvass the names of the brethren most suitable and seek for the mind of the Spirit, so that you may decide upon someone to fill this position. When you have thus decided, you can send the name to me, or if one of the Twelve should visit there soon--which we expect will be the case--you can submit your decision to him, and iffacceptable to the people he can be ordained to that position.The letter that President Jesse N. Smit and yourself wrote in relation to political matters in the County has been laid aside to submit to the Council of the Apostles; but at the mettings that we have held since its receipt other matters were so pressing that we did not reach that. As your Quarterly Conference is approaching, perhaps it will not be necessary for us to write to you upon this subject, because we are trying to arrange for Brother John Henry Smit and Bishop Robert T. Burton to attend the Snowflake Conference on the 1st. & 2nd. of Sept., and the Conference at your place on the 
 8th. &9th. When they meet with you they doubtless will be able to give you counsel upon all points connected with your situation that you will require, as they can do so much better on the ground than we can from this distance, not being familiar with all the points at issue. I have notified these brethren of our wish to have them attend these conferences, and expect to receive replies from them upon the subject. If they cannot go, we shall arrange, if possible, for some others to go, as we think you need to presence of wise and influential ment to enable you to reach definite conclusions respecting the differences of views which may exist amoung you. I think it will be well for yourself and such of the brethren of your Stake as can do so, to meet, as you suggest you think of doing, with the Saints at Snowflake on the occasion of their approaching conference.With kind regards,Your Brother,Wilford Woodruff 
 OFFICE OFThe First Presidencyof theChurch of Jesus ChristofLatter-day SaintsP.O.Box B.   Salt Lake City, Utah  December 31, 1896TO THE PRESIDENTS OF STAKES,Dear Brethren:- In consequence of thedecision which was reached at our last April Conference upon the sub-ject of making allowances to different officers of the Church for ser-vices, affairs have been in an unsettled condition, and there has beenuncertainty prevailing upon the subject of drawing from the Church anycompensation for services rendered.  As was explained on that occasion,it was not the design to deprive the brethren who are laboring invarious capacition and spending more or less of their time in thepublic service, of some compensation.  The design was to prevent thegrowth of a feeling that certain officers in the Church were to receivea certain amount.  We all felt that it was not a wise thing - in fact,that it was contrary to the purpose of the Almighty - that the minis-ters of His Church should receive fixed sums as salaries.  And it waspleasing to us to see the manner in which our views upon this questionwere received by the assembled brethren.The question has arisen, What allowance shall be made to thePresidents of Stakes and their Counselors? Shall we allow them the sameamounts that we did formerly? Or what amounts shall we allow them?In order to answer this question, we suggest that each Presi-dent of Stake and his Counselors get together, and, knowing eachother's circumstances, decide what amount they think would be properunder the circumstances for each of them to receive; with the under-standing, however, that the aggregate amount shall not exceed theamount heretofore allowed.  There may be members of the differentPresidencies of Stakes who may be in circumstances where they needbut little, if anything, from Church funds to help sustain them, andwho would take pride in rendering their services gratuitously to theChurch.  Some of these may be Presidents, and some Counselors.  On theother hand, there may be some Presidents and some Counselors who are incircumstances which require that they should receive some compensationfor their services.  Each President with his Counselors can decide thisand forward the statement to the office of the First Presidency.  Bydoing this we think that the purpose we had in view in our counsel tothe Priesthood at the April Conference will be carried out.  When thesereports are received, and they are acceptable to the Trustee-in-Trust,arrangements will then be made for orders to be sent covering the amountYour Brethren in the Gospel,Wilford WoodruffGeo.

Second West Street.Salt Lake City, Utah, Aug 12 1887Pres. W. WoodruffDear Brother.  Your favor of the 6th  inst. rec'd.  I beg leave to say in reply that I did not publish the names referred to without first consulting such persons as would be immediately interested; and in such cases as personal injury would be likely to occur, or where parties themselves did not wish the circumstance of their having been sealed to the Prophet made publice, we have not published them.  Most of what I published in this connection has been in print, ^before^ and hence was public property already, and what new matter I added I have not added without counseling with those whose right it is to counsel me, or at least making full explanations of my plan and object, which was simply this:  A great number of persons, (among them tho of my own brothers) are constantly listening to the Josephites, who claim that the Prophet Joseph never taught nor practised the principle of plural marriage, and they are gaining followers daily, perhaps, on that ground.  I have argued, reasoned and 
 discussed with some of them, until I thought it wasnecessary, for the sake of honest people, who are willing to be convinced, to republish in a compiled manner such affidavits and testimonies as had formerly beenmade public, but were scattered and partly lost, having been published in different papers and at different periods.  Now, brethren; with the exception of summing up and adding a few new names, I have simply stated what has been stated before, and I hope no harm has been done, but that good will result therefrom.  By way of further explanation I beg leave to say that the article was published before I knew anything of a Constitutional Convention coming of, or I would perhaps have had judgment enough to postpone publication at present, or at least referred the matter to you before printing.  There is, however, one consolation in connection ^with^ of of a possibility of harm being done,namely that the "Record" circulates only among our own people, and save a harmless notice about it in the Salt Lake Tribune I have heard nothing so far ^originating from my article^ that would harm us politically.  In justice to myself I deem this explanation necessary, adding that I at all times shall hold myself subject to counsel from those in authority in the Church over me, and that I, in consequence, shall  (according to your desire and judgment) not  "give any more names," until you shall advise me to do.With kind regards I remain Your Brother in the Gospel of Christ,Andrew Jenson. 
 Salt Lake City, Feb. 20, 1890President Wilford WoodruffDear Brother:Your kind favor of the 15thinst. reached me on the 17th,and I accept your ultimatum as regards my proposition of Sept. 23, 1889, although necessarily somewhat disappointed since the delay - awaiting your answer - will have considerable bearing upon my business operations in the future.As I am anxious to continue my historical labors and gather materialtogether, which I at all times hold subject to the Church historians, if they desire copies, I would kindly ^ask^ if the $5000 allowance from the GeneralTithing ^Office^ toward the maintainance of my family (which I have been drawing during the last two years) will be continued?  If so, I think, I shall be able to continue the "Record" until such times as you may wish to take the matter in hand.  I have on hand already considerable matter which I have gathered concerning the various Stakes of Zion,but finding the undertaking a greater work, and coupled with many more difficulties,than I at first anticipated, it will take several years yet to complete it. 
 Awaiting your kind answer to this, at your earliest convenience, I remainYour Brother in the Gospel,Ancrew Jenson

Q. Cannonand Joseph F.

Such was ^indeed^ the case as long as I published in the Danish language, Elder Erastus Snow being appointed by the late Pres. Brigham Young, and subsequently by the late Pres. John Taylor, to supervise my labors.  But since commencing the "Record," four years ago, I have published on my own responsibility, no one having been appointed to supervise my work.  This, I may say, has often grieved me, and although I have at times

And in order to make myself plain I hereby ask leave to state that I am willing to devote my entire future life in the interest of Church history, and I offer you my services, from the 1st  of January next, with or without any compensation of a material nature,  just as you desire; and shall be willing to work at the Historian's Office or travel through the country gathering historical information, according to your best judgment.

We aresending out a large number of missionaries in variousdirections and it is important that in making sel-ections we should get the best material available for thepurpose. It is not unreasonable to suppose that many veryworthy persons who would make excellent missionariesare overlooked, while many who are not so suitable areselected. It appears to us that this business of selectingmissionaries can be more systematized, and be attendedwith more satisfactory results than it is at the present time. The calls for missionaries should be consideredby the Twelve Apostles. They should understand thefields to be supplied and the kind of men that areneeded to supply them.

Udall & Counselors,St. Johns Stake.Dear Brethren:- It appears to me, in view of the political changes which have been made of late in the nation, and those which are likely to occur in the near future in your Territory, that it is of the utmost importance for the Latter-day Saints to so arrange their affairs and organize their domestic and other relations as not ot become a prey to the wicked designs of politicians and persons disposed to cause our people trouble in consequence of their religious convictions and practices in accord therewith. I trust that those to whom the watchcare of the saints has been entrusted- the Presidency of Stakes, the Bishops and leading Elders of the Church- will be wide awake in these critical times and leave no duty undone which they can do, to guard and protect the interests of the people of God with whom they are called to labor; and by the eye of faith and wisdom that they will be able to foresee the dangesrs which may threaten, and take the necessary steps to forewarn, advise and direct, for their safety, such as may be exposed to the evil intentions of their enemies.Having called your attention to this important subject, I leave it with you to take such steps as in your wisdom and in the spirit of your callings, propted by the Holy Ghost, you may consider the most prudent, safe and effectual.With kind regards,Your Brother,W Woodruff

Cannon called on me and brought a special and direct message from you to the effecct that you desired me to give to L. P. Neve a deed to some property which I own in Mill Creek, and which said Neve has been suing me for in court.  Immediately upon receiving your message, I want to my attorney, Bro.Franklin L. Richards, and instructed him to hand over the deed which had already been executed.  And L. P. Neve will be notified by me personally to-day that Bro. Richards will give him the deed on his payment of some tax money and a portion of the court expenses.  The property in question is worth about $5000 (it cost me more than that),and is the same property to which I executed a deed to the trustee-in-trust, about 1 1/2 years ago, which deed could not then be 
 delivered till a decision of the court had been obtainedI take it for granted that you understand the case (though I have not mentioned the matter to you myself) and that you had good reasons for making the request.Of course everything I have is on the altar,according to covenants which I have made;and I feel to bow in obedience to your request, though I must confess that under existing circumstances, I cannot think of a person that I would not rather give my property to than L. P. Neve.In order not to place myself in a false light before you, I will state that I have already made up my mind to give up the property, according to a most unjust decision of a court, and was only waiting for the adjustment, by my attorney, of some miner matters connected with it.  But I had not looked for a request from the president of the Church to do so.With the best of feeling toward you, I remainYour Brother in the Gospel,Andrew JensonNote:  Jensen was seen in regardto this by G J Gibbs, about one & a half hours after it was brought to the office by himself, & was informed by Bro Gibbs that Pres.

 L. D. S. Historian's Office,P. O. Box 1678.Salt Lake City, Utah, June 5, 1894President Wilford WoodruffDear BrotherThe enclosed letter signedby Charles M. Jeppson, A. C. Thomsen andMads Nielsen, of Pleasant Grove, Utah Co.,was handed me this morning by ElderGeorge Reynolds for answer.  By wayof explanation I will say that I paidthe means referred to strictly accordingto the written instructions of the lateThomas Andersen, and happily I am stillin possession of the original documentsauthorizing me to do as I did.  The lateThomas Andersen never as much asintimated that I should pay any or allof it to the Pleasant Grove ward: I was topay it to the Trustee in Trust of theChurch of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,to be used by him according to hisjudgment for the benefit of the Church,If he should decide to use part of it forthe benefit of the Pleasant Grove first 
 Ward, I have no objection; but certainit is that the donor of the means neverexposed himself to me to have this done;nor do I recollect that any of the admi-nistrators hinted at such a thing untilafter I had paid over the means asdirected in writing by the late ThomasAndersen.  After the death of Bro. AndersenI paid $150 to each of two heirs, children ofBro. Andersen, and in doing so, I tookpains to ask both of them (one of them)the husband of an heir if they had anyobjections to the remainder being paid over tothe Trustee-in-trust, as directed in thewritten document, signed by the late Thos.Andersen, which I read to them. Bothexpressed the desire that his request becomplied with; and it was done accordingly.I have always known what to do with themoney, the statement to the contrary not-withstanding.  When I paid the money tothe Trustee-in-Trust, I agreed to shoulderthe responsibility I repeat now that I amresponsible for my actions in this matter, andyou need not be troubled anymore concer-ning it.  With the highest esteem I remain,Your Brother in the GospelAndrew Jenson. 
 Historian's Office, Oct. 1, 1897.To The First Presidency And Apostles.Dear Brethren:-In response to your request that I should prepare a series of tracts for missionary purposes, as suggested by the brethren in charge of the British Mission, I have written twelve tracts which I believe will meet the neccessities of the times in that particular.  After entering upon the work I thought it better to continue and complete the series uniformly, than to cull fromother pamphlets or to mix in other tracts.  This set will make a series of twelve tracts of four pages each, and will introduce the First Principles of the Gospel, the Apostacy, the Restoration, the Authority of the Priesthood, the Book of Mormon, Baptism for the Dead, the Establishment of Zion, the Work Performed by the Saints in Utah, etc., in consec^u^tive order, one tract leading up to those succeeding.  I believe they will be found suitable for distribution in any of the Missions.  I hold them at your disposal, and if you see fit to refer them to any person or committee for review, I shall be pleased to submit them, and assist in their inspection if you so desire.Very respectfully yours,C.

 willing to bear testimony to the same, bysigning their resources to an obligation,promising to abstain from the use of Tea,Coffee, Cigarettes, Tobacco, + Intoxicating drinks,and the use of meats, only in moderation.Some of all ages would sign such a pledgein every congregation, a card of membershipshould then be given them, and their namesentered in a book,called,say ["illegible"] 1 DivisionAnother appeal should then be made to thesame congregation for those to signanother pledge, promising to abstain fromthe use of "Tobacco and Strong drink," acard should be given to them as members of No 2 Division, of the Latter day SaintTemperance Society.  When that is done,ask all the members of both division toarise and I venture an assertion that inmany instances the great majority of thecongregation would arise.I cannot imagine any other effort thatcould be made, that would lead to such 
 glorious results.Religion without morality issimply a farce, and the thousandsof professing Latter day saints, whosedaily habits of life, being in direct antago-nism to the Word and Will of the Lord,certainly calls aloud for some mightyeffort, to stem this torrent of iniquity.Strong drink the fascinating dram, and Saloons and Gambling hells, the rendezvous,where all kinds of evil, such as fighting,stealing, whoring, sabbath breaking +c +care concocted.If any direct effort can be inauguratedto dry up in our community these helltraps, so that our youth can be successfullybrought up without their contamination,happy will those be who take an activepart, and all who countenance and lendtheir influence in that direction.Your BrotherGeorge Goddard
