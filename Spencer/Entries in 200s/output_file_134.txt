It was  Before Albany was utterly Destroyed by fire It was before Boston was sunk with an Earthquake.

It was before the many  Millions of the  of the Earth were destroyed  Great Judgments of God Because of their great sins &amp;  wickedness in the sight of Heaven &amp; Earth, this was Before the United States became so weakened &amp; Broaken to peaces that they called upon Brigham Young to take the Presidency of  the United States to save the Constitution &amp; the remnant of  the Nation from utter destruction. If this will not be  the conversation of those little children  in the procession with their Banners to welcome the prophet &amp; Apostles on their Enterance into this City, thirty years  from this it will be sumthing like it.

Kimballs Remarks He said Vilate &amp; I have lived together 46 years and I have left   ENDENTRY     her good By as much then as I have now. I did this in Zions Camp also when I went to England &amp; at different times. She has been true to me always and never left Nor forsook me. I have taken 40 wives &amp; many without her knowledge but she afterwards gave them to me in the Temple. She has passed through many trials but she has been always true to me. When Vilate was first taken sick the spirits took the advantage of her. When I went to lay  hands upon her I saw a Devil in the room meeting me &amp; I saw it several times. I felt indignant by the spirit of God, there is  many fals spirits that are trying to destroy our children, and will destroy all they can. We should strive to overcome them she sympathized with me untill her last Breath. Br Brigham &amp; I have stood By Joseph unto the End, &amp; he will never forsake or forget us No never. No more than God will forget his ownly Begotten Son. The foregoing is ownly a synopsis of his remarks Farewell all Earthly honors was then sung &amp; J Taylor Dismissed The Following is a synopsis of remarks of President Brigham Young at the commencement of the Funeral of Vilate Kimball He was the first speaker. He said when I buried my first wife I do not think there was a tear shed, and it is a great victory gained to overcome the death &amp; the grave &amp; have a glorious resurrection The good often suffer as well as the wicked we suffer in the Flesh but when we  die &amp; the spirit leaves the Body The Devil &amp; Evil has No more power over us When the spirits of the righteous Enter the spirit world they are Beyond the power of the Devil. The knowledge, which the Latter Day Saints have obtained have put us in possession of power which the world has not. We live not for this world alone but for the resurrection. There  the Best they could They would not wish to try it over again where does Vilate go when this Body is laid off She is in the presence of God not whare his Tabernacle is but have his presence in spirit &amp; we can see all things that we wish or desire to see we are as much in the presence of God in this City as though we were with him in person I do not know whether Vilate is with us in this room or not but we have good spirits with us   ENDENTRY     fall from Heaven &amp; wicked men to contend with but whare, those spirits have power on a person they Effect the body but does it take any Glory from Vilate because of her affliction No not in the least she will have a greater reward. She has not Been afflicted because of sins, But Because the devil has power on her body &amp; some in this Evil spirits &amp; devils they try to destroy the ignorant Vilate will come forth with her body &amp; will stand at the Head of this  Family &amp; Heber at her head as he has here &amp; this will be the case with all who are good. Now we should prepare ourselves to go as well as Vilate has. let us be faithful  till we hear the Trump sound. I Expect Joseph Smith will be the first man resurrected then He will resurrect his family Just when he pleases &amp; if we live so as to come forth in the first Resurrection we shall rejoice to all Eternity President Joseph Young spoke a few moments It was a solem time At the close of the funeral the Body was removed to the  Family Grave of Brother Kimball       ENDENTRY October 26, 1868    FIGURE Feble in health and about noon my Indian Boy Sarokeets came up from the field &amp; had quit his work &amp; had left the Cane Mill with No one to Feed it &amp; they were Boiling Molasses &amp; had not help Enough so they set my little son Asahel ownly 5 years old to feed the mill so while feeding he got his right hand caught in the rollers He hallowed &amp; the Mule instantly stoped &amp; the Mill  rolled back but still it smashed about one half of his hand his Mother Wilford took him into the waggon &amp; came to  the City as soon as they could, they came to Dr Olmsby, &amp; while I was talking to Keets Wilford drove up &amp; informed me of the accident that had happened to Asahel I immediately went to the docters &amp; there found the Boy with his hand in a dredful condition we gave him cloraform &amp; it took about one hour to dress his hand it took off his Thumb &amp; two fingers But   ENDENTRY     &amp; we had to watch him closely all night He suffered a great deal through the night    ENDENTRY October 27, 1868    the lock Jaw He was quite a sufferer through the day I set up with him untill 10 oclok at Night He rested quite well  the fore part of the night But suffered a good deal the latter part My Indian Boy Sarroqueets left to day I have raised two of them nearly from childhood up But they have  made me a good deal of trouble they are vary uncertain help    ENDENTRY October 28, 1868    has been to pour cold water onto his hand to keep it  it constantly wet to keep out the inflamation &amp; fever I  gave him salts to cool the fever &amp; to open his Bowels I gave him some Morphene when the suffering became intolerable but the Main thing was to pour cold water on his hand &amp; give him all the cold water He wanted to drink I called to the Historians  office a short time &amp; sent G A Smiths Historical Sermons to  Shuah C Moulton  to Ozem Woodruff    ENDENTRY October 29, 1868    a great deal of suffering we had a hard, rain, snow, &amp; hail storm,  the first rain we have had for a long time.
