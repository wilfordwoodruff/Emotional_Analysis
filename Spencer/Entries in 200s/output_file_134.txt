I was quite weak this morning but sat up and wrote some in my Journal In looking over my papers I found President Heber C Kimball remarks at the funeral of his wife Vilate Kimball He spoke 38 minutes  FIGURES Heber C. Kimballs Remarks He said Vilate and I have lived together 46 years and I have left   ENDENTRY The Funeral of Vilate M Kimball Oct 24 1867   Her many times to go and preach the gospel of Jesus Christ. I bid her good By as much then as I have now. I did this in Zions Camp also when I went to England and at different times. She has been true to me always and never left Nor forsook me. I have taken 40 wives and many without her knowledge but she afterwards gave them to me in the Temple. She has passed through many trials but she has been always true to me. When Vilate was first taken sick the spirits took the advantage of her. When I went to lay  hands upon her I saw a Devil in the room meeting me and I saw it several times. I felt indignant by the spirit of God, there is  many fals spirits that are trying to destroy our children, and will destroy all they can. We should strive to overcome them she sympathized with me untill her last Breath. Br Brigham and I have stood By Joseph unto the End, and he will never forsake or forget us No never. No more than God will forget his ownly Begotten Son. The foregoing is ownly a synopsis of his remarks Farewell all Earthly honors was then sung and J Taylor Dismissed The Following is a synopsis of remarks of President Brigham Young at the commencement of the Funeral of Vilate Kimball He was the first speaker. He said when I buried my first wife I do not think there was a tear shed, and it is a great victory gained to overcome the death and the grave and have a glorious resurrection The good often suffer as well as the wicked we suffer in the Flesh but when we  die and the spirit leaves the Body The Devil and Evil has No more power over us When the spirits of the righteous Enter the spirit world they are Beyond the power of the Devil. The knowledge, which the Latter Day Saints have obtained have put us in possession of power which the world has not. We live not for this world alone but for the resurrection. There is^are^ man^y^ in this room who have done the Best they could They would not wish to try it over again where does Vilate go when this Body is laid off She is in the presence of God not whare his Tabernacle is but have his presence in spirit and we can see all things that we wish or desire to see we are as much in the presence of God in this City as though we were with him in person I do not know whether Vilate is with us in this room or not but we have good spirits with us   ENDENTRY The Funeral of Vilate Kimball Oct 24 1867   and we feel themir influence. We also have all the devils that fall from Heaven and wicked men to contend with but whare, those spirits have power on a person they Effect the body but does it take any Glory from Vilate because of her affliction No not in the least she will have a greater reward. She has not Been afflicted because of sins, But Because the devil has power on her body and some in this Evil spirits and devils they try to destroy the ignorant Vilate will come forth with her body and will stand at the Head of this  Family and Heber at her head as he has here and this will be the case with all who are good. Now we should prepare ourselves to go as well as Vilate has. let us be faithful  till we hear the Trump sound. I Expect Joseph Smith will be the first man resurrected then He will resurrect his family Just when he pleases and if we live so as to come forth in the first Resurrection we shall rejoice to all Eternity President Joseph Young spoke a few moments It was a solem time At the close of the funeral the Body was removed to the  Family Grave of Brother Kimball   One Line Blank    ENDENTRY October 26, 1868 ~ Monday   Oct 26, 1868 To day was quite a serious day I was quite FIGURE Feble in health and about noon my Indian Boy Sarokeets came up from the field and had quit his work and had left the Cane Mill with No one to Feed it and they were Boiling Molasses and had not help Enough so they set my little son Asahel ownly 5 years old to feed the mill so while feeding he got his right hand caught in the rollers He hallowed and the Mule instantly stoped and the Mill  rolled back but still it smashed about one half of his hand his Mother Wilford took him into the waggon and came to  the City as soon as they could, they came to Dr Olmsby, and while I was talking to Keets Wilford drove up and informed me of the accident that had happened to Asahel I immediately went to the docters and there found the Boy with his hand in a dredful condition we gave him cloraform and it took about one hour to dress his hand it took off his Thumb and two fingers But   ENDENTRY Oct 26   most of his two last fingers I took him home to my house  and we had to watch him closely all night He suffered a great deal through the night    ENDENTRY October 27, 1868 ~ Tuesday   27 Asahel had a spasm this morning and came near having  the lock Jaw He was quite a sufferer through the day I set up with him untill 10 oclok at Night He rested quite well  the fore part of the night But suffered a good deal the latter part My Indian Boy Sarroqueets left to day I have raised two of them nearly from childhood up But they have  made me a good deal of trouble they are vary uncertain help    ENDENTRY October 28, 1868 ~ Wednesday   28 Asahel has suffered a good deal to day our treatment  has been to pour cold water onto his hand to keep it  it constantly wet to keep out the inflamation and fever I  gave him salts to cool the fever and to open his Bowels I gave him some Morphene when the suffering became intolerable but the Main thing was to pour cold water on his hand and give him all the cold water He wanted to drink I called to the Historians  office a short time and sent G A Smiths Historical Sermons to  Shuah C Moulton  to Ozem Woodruff    ENDENTRY October 29, 1868 ~ Thursday   29.
