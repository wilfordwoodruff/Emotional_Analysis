A little previous to the main herds being seen 3 bulls were discoverd on the  bluff O. P. Rockwell and two others went after them and  wounded two but got neither of them we had not  travled more than 2 miles before we discoverd another  large herd of about 200, 5 miles ahead of us the hunters  got together held a council and waited untill the camp all  came up we were determined to get some of the buffalo  if possible we travled together untill we were within one mile  of the buffalo we then made a halt, and 15 hunters started out Amasa Lyman and myself of the Twelve made two of the numb ber we all travled together on to the bluffs within a few rods  of them and there divided out into companies Br Grover and  Luke Johnson went together into the bluffs O. P. Rockwell  and Br Brown took the entire left and so we divided into compa- nies on the right left and center I was in a company in the  centre of the herd and we all made a charge upon them from  the bluffs and rushed on to the Plain, the herd run vary fast  down the ruff bluffs into the plain but when we came up to  the plain we soon came on to them each company singled  out his game we made choice of Cows generally then rushed  up by the side of them and fired upon them with our Pistols  such as horse Pistols Rifle Pistols andc which are much better  to carry than rifles as they are vary cumberson in runing the first  that we gave chase to was a Buffaloo Cow with her calf I  rode by the side of her and fired two balls from my Pistols  into her. the other Brethren with me also fired into her  untill we killed we cut her throat I then run my  horse to the assistance of another Party who had wounded  one and that one was also soon dispatched.

Br Solomon Hancock went  out in the morning on to the bluffs to kill buffalo on foot He did not come in at night we felt concerned about him early in the morning he came in, had killed a 3 year old cow and watched it over night to keep the volves from eating it  3 wolves came upon him he shot one the rest run  away this made 12 buffalo in all that the hunters  killed to day which we considered was doing vary well  considering that we were nearly all strangers to that mode  of hunting as but vary few of us ever saw a wild  buffalo before in our lives we dressed out meat and waggons  came from camp to take it in. A part of this chase was  through one of the largest Prairie dog towns nearly ever  seen it was nearly ten miles long and 2 wide and full of  burrows nearly evry rod and great danger of a horse steping into them and falling, there was no accident happened  at all to any one which was truly a blessing my horse stumbled once and come nigh falling but no harm done this was  the first buffalo hunt I ever took part in or saw we travled to day with the camp 18 miles we discovered Indian fires on the south and west of us    ENDENTRY May 2, 1847 ~ Sunday   2nd Suunday All were busy cooking and saving there meat in the afternoon we moved up 3 miles for better feed and  camped by the side of a large slew of water our camping  place last night and this morning was at the head of Grand Island Professor Pratt took an observation for the Lattitude and found  it to be 40° 41' 42" this agrees with Freemonts obervation  within 2 miles and his was on the south side of the river which  was 2 miles south of our camping place we came through another  large dog town to day, soon after we camped a herd of  buffalo came from the bluffs to the river to drink  within about 2 miles of us and then returned to the bluffs some were anxious to go after them, but as it was  Sunday Br Young thought it best to let them be  untill tomorrow the Indians set fire to the Prairie  before us which burnt rapedly over a large region of  country Brs Young Kimball and several others went  several miles in the evening on our road to examine  the fire and other things. distance 3 miles    ENDENTRY May 3, 1847 ~ Monday   3rd The hunters were called together in the morning  20 in number to go into the bluffs for a still hunt for  bluffs buffalo and other game we started out with  two waggons to bring in the game I had taken a  severe cold and setled in my side whare I was hurt  last fall and it made me sick and I was not able  to go out yet I started with the company as I  was among the hunters I had Jarred myself   ENDENTRY badly in my hard buffalo chase on Saturday and I now  was feeling its effects at the same time the hunters  started. Another company was formed to go and explore out  the rout and see if we could get grass for our horses as the  Indians had been burning it up for several days. We went  into the bluffs and seperated into two Parties 10 in each  and we travled some 10 miles back and and forth over the hills and saw no game except antelope and wolvesNo I felt so  unwell I concluded to go back to camp. A Lyman and  3 others were with me. we set down upon the edge of the bluff in sight of the camp to rest ourselves and we  saw a company of 20 horsman approaching ^us^ from the camp in haste bearing a red flag when they got within  half a mile of us we trailed our arms and went down to meet them. they informed us that the party that  went up the river had come upon an encampment  of about 400 Indian warriors. A party of about 100  had followed them down a ravene to cut off their  retreat probably with the Intention of robbing them of their horses and clothing and would take life if they could not do it with out and this company of horsman  had come to us to call in the hunters to camp so  we went in the hunters in coming in with the horsman came across a herd of buffalo and brought into camp 3 calf, and 4 antelope they kept out a good guard during the night and we had no disturbance the  cannon was fired twice early in the morning to let  the Indians know we were awake. I had a vary  severe night with my side was in much pain we had some ^a great^ dew and frost during the night. 12    ENDENTRY May 4, 1847 ~ Tuesday   4th Thermometer stands at 33° this morning I feel some better than I did last night we started on our journey this morning 5 waggons a breast which made  5 roads this was to be in readiness in case of an attack from  the Indians we travled 3 miles and saw some waggons on the opposite side of the river. going down the Platt soon one of the  men waded the Platt and came to us, to see who we were. He info- rmed us they were traders from fort Laramee he had been  there 3 years had not tasted bread for 2 years, was 16 days from Laramee the grass was green and good on the south side to that fort but burnt of on the North side He waided the Platt to come to us a mile across it and did not go but little above his  knees He would take letters to us to Sarpee who lived near  winter Quarters so the campe stoped and wrote 52 letters to  our familys I was ahead of the company with O Pratt taking observations and did not know untill the time was nearly up I then in great haste scribbled a few lines to my wife An epistle  was written to the Church andc. Three Brethren accompanied the  Frenchman accross the Platt to the other men was 9 in all had not seen an Indian since they left Laramee, stated their was a ferry at the fort andc agreed to take our letters safe we drove on 3 miles more and bated our teams untill the Brethren  returned they made a report to the camp of what was  said to them a Council of the whole camp was then called  to deside whether we would cross the Platt or continue up   ENDENTRY the North side of it we were convinced that it wood  be better for us as a company to cross the river on illegible take the old travled road to Laramee as their was good grass on  the way on that side while the Indians were burning  it all off on the North side of the river where we were  travling but when we took into consideration the  situation of the next company and thousands that would  follow after and as we were the Pioneers and had not our  wives and children with us we thought it best to keep on  the north side of the river and brave the difficulties of  burning Prairies and make a road that should stand as  a permanant rout for the Saints indipendant of the  old emigration rout and let the river seperate the emigrating  companies that they need not quarrel for wood grass  or water and when our next company came along the grass  would be much better for them than it would on the south side as it would grow up by the time they would get  along. A vote was called and it was unanimous to go on  the north side of the river. So the camp again moved  on, but during the nooning Col Markham drilled the men  in a military capacity, they unshiped the cannon and carried it on wheels, the Frenchman informed us that he never  saw so many buffalo on on the rout this year they had to  stop several times to let the herd pass so they could get  along, we saw many deer and antelope to day and also wolves  and a few buffalo one large bull came across the river to us, we rode onto the bank before him and he run  clear back again upon a loap and again crossed below us we camped at night at a gravel creek or slew a large  herd of buffalo lay but a short distance before us we travled in all to day 9 m 9 miles    ENDENTRY May 5, 1847 ~ Wednesay   5th I was quite sick with the diaree the change from  salt to fresh meat is affecting a number in camp The 400 Indian warriors that was supposed to be seen  on the 3rd proved to be fals the man was frightened  at a herd of antelope and supposed them to be Indians we had to keep a guard out this morning to keep a herd of buffalo from mixing up with our cattle we have had vary strong south wind for 2 days, two buffalo bulls at noon were approaching the  herd of cows and men went out and drove them off  we rode up within 3 rods of one that was asleep and stoped and looked at him for some minutes he awoke and  shook himself and loaped off we met a large herd in the afternoon the Brethren killed one cow 5 calves and brought a bull calf into camp a live with the intention of raising it, it would drink  water out of a pail they had some sport in triying to make it suckle a cow it would try hard to bunt  the men and dogs over and some got hard raps I have  been obliged to keep my bed a part of the day have suffered much with bowel complaint, when we  stoped for night we soon found ourselves in the midst of grass on fire and had to return back   ENDENTRY one mile and camped on a spot of ground on the bank  of the river that was just burned over and no feed  except small patches some took there horses on an Island near and cut down cotton wood for them we travled to day 15 miles    ENDENTRY May 6, 1847 ~ Thursday   6th I was some better this morning we had some rain last  night I had a poor nights rest. we started early this  morning without feeding (except a little corn) as there was no grass and travled 3 miles and got beyond the fire left it in our  rear and stop to bait and breakfast on a good spot of grass, this  morning the herds of buffalo speck the plains on both sides  of the river and antelope in great abundance some of  which run into camp, the buffalo calf is dead this morning that was brought into camp alive last night we continued our journey saw many herds of buffalo antelope and one large  herd of elk a young buffalo clalf came into camp and followed us we gave him some milk and left him we travled 10 miles  and nooned on the prairie. we scarsly meet with any timber  now, two antelope were killed this forenoon but as we have  so much meet in camp it is thought best not to kill any more buffalo untill we need it or any other game. we were visited at noon with many buffalo Dr G. A. Smith and myself walked up quite near several buffalo herds and exhamined them through  our glasses they were sheding their coats one bull had a mat  of wool swining by his side, like a loose robe, our herd of  cows started to run among the buffalo and President Young  run his horse to seperate them and had great difficulty in doing it He lost a spy glass in the chase worth $40, the Brethren hunted for it a long time but could not find it we continued to journey among the herds of buffalo and we  are not out of sight of them at all they have eat the  grass out to such a degree that our cattle and horses can  get but vary little to eat we camped near a herd at  night that reached as far as our eyes could extend there were thousands in it distance of the day 20 m    ENDENTRY May 7, 1847 ~ Friday   7th A meeting was called one of the herdsman recieved  a sharp reproof for neglecting the cows yesterday a teem was called for to take the canon we had an exceding  cold north wind to day we travled 6 miles and camped upon the bank of the river I should judge we saw 10,000 buffalo to day we came near large herds with a greater propor tion than usual of calves, yearlings and two year olds we saw  several large ones mired, dead, wolves had commenced eating  some of them we could see wolves upon evry hand  following the herds of buffalo to eat those who die of wounds, accident or poverty. we had some rain in the  evening.

Br Kimball remarked that he had herd many buffalo tales told but he never expe- cted to behold what his eyes now saw the half had not been  told him we saw many dead scattered about and many  wolves following the herds, when we stoped at noon many of  them walked along by the side of our waggons so that  we might easily have shot them down, O P Rockwell did  shoot one through the neck and she droped dead it was a  two year old heifer and good meet there were a great number  of calves and young cattle in the herds we saw to day we saw  had great difficulty in keeping our cattle and horses from going  among them for if they once get mixed with a herd  it is almost impossible to ever get them again. we  travled to day untill we came to the bluffs that made  down to the river and camped for the night distance 11 1/4 mi   I went onto the top of the highest bluffs that were near  us and took a survey of the surrounding country with our  glasses there being present B.

Mercury stands at 41, we had a strong  S. wind through the day we travled 8 miles and nooned we then  travled 4 miles and camped for the night on the bank of  the North fork of the Platt I rode onto the bluffs to take a  survey of the country which was about 3 miles from the  river and we found both on the hills and flatts through the  day, travel that we were traveling over the Soux hunting  ground there had been a large band from 500 to 1000 we  should judge from there signs over the ground from 8 to 10  days before us, they took the brains out of the large buffalo generally their hides and some of the meet and broke up the  bones for the marrow, 20 100 calves were found dead in one  place with nothing taken but the tongues, legs to the knee and entrails another place 35 calves were found dead  and washed in heaps whare the buffalo had been chased  acrosse the river and run over the calves in rising the  bank of the river. I found on the bluff their  medicine bag tied to a stick 6 feet long stuck up in the  bank it was what is called kinikinnick composed of  tobacco and bark to smoke I also found a saddle tied to a large  buffalo dung I supposed to show the next party which  way the buffalo had gone I left my horse in the valley  to feed while I went onto a bluff to see the country and  he started off not seeing the camp took the back tract   ENDENTRY and I had to run after him and while following him, I run through the great Soux encampmen whare  they had had there lodges while on their hunt I left  my gun there and followed my horse untill I overtook  him with the assistance of Br Fowler who came out from  the encampment and stoped him I then rode back got  my gun examined the ground and should judge their  had been 500 lodges there was acres of ground covered  with buffalo wool whare they had dressed there skins they left much stuff scattered over the ground such  as peaces of dressed buffalo and mogascins  andc I brought in a good dressed white wolf skin distance of the day 12 mil   I could see the bluff between the forks of the river  about 10 miles above us the bluffs that I passed over  to day were more fertile and covered with more grass  than any I had seen on the Platt before a young  buffalo was killed and brought in in the evening    ENDENTRY May 13, 1847 ~ Thursday   13 Many of the Brethren went out to visit the Indian  encampment and brought in mogasens, parts of robes  leather andc, we have a strong cold north wind to  day, we travled to day 11 miles and camped on the  west bank of a stream about 12 rods wide with  good ford that empties into the Platt this is nearly  opposite the first bluff that is formed between  the two forks of the Platt, the grass was better than  it had had been, the bluff here for the first time  on the north fork comes hold to the river so that  we have to go over the bluffs with our waggons there is one thing concerning the Platt river which  is worthy of note, which is not characteristic of any  other river that I have any knowledge of in the world it is much of the way a mile in wedth and generally  coverd with water but vary shallow when a South  wind blows hard the water all rushes to the north  shore untill one would suppose there was a great rise  in the water let the wind shift and bolow hard from  the North and the watter immediately leaves the north  shore untill one can walk across two thirds of the  river on bare ground and the river constantly ebs and  flows like the tide just according as the wind blows I went onto the bluffs hunting buffalo in the evening saw  several small herds President Young gave the stream  we camped on the name of the bluff fork.   I dreamed last night we had arived at our journey end  whare we were to build up a stake of Zion. As we came  unto the place there was an open temple  presented before me I asked some brethren that stood  by me If they saw it they said they did not I gazed  upon it and it was glorious it appeared as though it was  built of white and blue stone the sight of it filled me  with Joy and I awoke, and behold it was a dream 11 m   ENDENTRY May 14, 1847 ~ Friday   14th I went out early in the morning to hunt some  buffalo I cashed myself in the bank and a large herd  came along, but their old bulls was out as a rear and  front guard and there was none of their young cattle  near enough for me to shooht so they past by I saw  some more coming I way laid them they proved to  be 7 bulls I fired at the youngest one while he passed by but missed him I then returned to camp took breakfast had a hard shower of rain and some words  with Br Higby  soon Killed an antelope that was put on board  of a boat called the revenue cutter Phineas Young and myself went out together waited for buffalo and  antilope I finally got lost among the bluff, but  found my way out again Br Phineas shot an buck antilope and I carried him into camp there was 3 antilope and one buffalo bull killed. some of the  hunters thought they herd Indian guns on the opposit side of the river during the night an Indian cralled up to a pair of mules that was tied together and made a grab to ketch them they sprung and got  away from him one of the guards shot at him and he run all horses  were then brought into the circle and the cannon prepared for firing but seeing no more it was not fired travled 8 miles    ENDENTRY May 15, 1847 ~ Saturday   15th A vary cold North wind and rain we however travled about 3 miles and camped in the best grass we had found on  the road, most of our road this morning was over and through the bluffs as they come again bold to the river a large number of  barefoot tracks was seen this morning under the bluff on the bank of the river, supposed to be the Indians that came down  last night to steal our horses, the rain stoped in the afternoon  and we drove 5 miles and camped on the prairie. distance 8 miles we saw the bluffs dotted over with buffalo I went out with  some others to hunt them I could not get within about 30  rods of them I shot at the neck of one and the ball went into his  sholdier which crippled him but he hobbled away with  the herd and I did not get him but there were a number  of hunters among the herds and one of them killed a fat  buffalo which was brought into camp. the bluffs again come  down to the river a short distance before us    ENDENTRY May 16, 1847 ~ Sunday   16th Sunday still cloudy and cool wind. I did not feel vary  well this morning and did not rise untill 7 oclok which was  two hours after the time when I got out of my carriage  I found all five of my horses standing at the stakes while all the other horses of the encampment had been feeding  two hours. It was Br John Fowlers business to let them out but he did not get up untill half an hour after I did. He Is destitute of the spirit or principle that a faithf- ul man or servant should possess and it makes it  much harder upon me in the care of the teams and  business than it would if I had a true and faithful man with me Br Burnham does our cooking which  keeps him vary busy and he has the hardest time of it as much of the time he has nothing but buffalo dung   ENDENTRY to make a fire of we are now in a place whare we are  proving ourselves and if we are not faithful we shall come under condemnation. I rode out to day with Brothers Young  Rockwell and Stephens 4 miles over the bluffs to pick out a road for the camp to go across to get again on the bottoms we found a road through and returned to the  camp I picked up a young hare which Br Young took in to  camp, we saw herds of buffalo while coming in. Br  Glines went out hunting and shot an antelope and one buffalo though it was against the rules of the camp and council of  his captain to go hunting on Sunday. we had a good meeting in the afternoon Br I opened meeting by Prayer Brs Kimball spoke and the laws of the camp were read and a good spirit prevailed  the channel of the teaching was to harken to council and sustain  the Heads of the Church and go and do what was said unto us  and it would prove a blessing unto us 8 mi    ENDENTRY May 17, 1847 ~ Monday   17th It is much more warm and plesant to day than usual our road hads been hard to day we came 2 1/2 miles through sandy bluffs, we  again struck the bottom 4 1/2 miles from our camping place but  the bottom was much softer than usual and many slues to cross we crossed about one dozen streams to day of vary clear water  that come from springs in the bluff from 1 to 10 feet across them which run almost on the top of the ground without  any bank at all, with hard sand or gravel bottom, the water  however was not as cold as spring water generally is, the hunters brought in 3 buffalo and it detained the camp some to  get them in, President Young was not pleased with it as we had so much meet in camp already and they went out without council. we saw vary large droves of deer to day in  the bottoms the most we have ever seen any day on the road  A young Fawn was picked up and brought into camp and kept we travled in all to day 12 3/4 miles   I led the camp mostly through the bluffs in the morning before  Before Brothers Young and Kimball came up we rode together  all day picking our roads    ENDENTRY May 18, 1847 ~ Tuesday   18th The camp was called together or the captains of companies and President Young sharply reproved, the hunters for shooting so much meet when it was not needed and detaining the  camp or for taking life any more than could be helepd and  also the horsman for their indiferance in picking out the road he said there was but two that had rode thant manifested  any interest in helping him get the camp along. He spoke vary sharply upon the indiferance of men, and they  rejected the meet when it was brought into camp andc the camp started out after the meet was disposed of and the hunters or horsman went forward to pick out the  road instead of going hunting I did not hear a gun fired on the road during the day Amasa Lyman was one called  by name and reproved for not paying any attention to seeking  out the road, but he was with us to day in that business we rode 6 miles and cnooned we rode in the afternoon  9 3/4 miles and camped for the night distance of the day 15 3/4 m   ENDENTRY May 19, 1847 ~ Wednesday   19th we crossed the worse sand hill bluff of about one  mile that we have crossed on the journey and what made it still  worse the rain was pouring down upon us continually we travled  about 1/2 mile on the flat and camped untill the rain was over for  the time being we started again at 3 oclok but it soon began to rain  again hard we travled untill 5 oclok and camped for the night on the bank  of the river we travled 8 miles by the wheelometer 8 miles   I rode forward during the day in the rain and picked out the road  we had the most water fall during the day and evening that we  have met with on the whole journey    ENDENTRY May 20, 1847 ~ Thursday   20th we came 7 miles and camped for our nooning on the North  side of the Ash Creek that comes through the  bluffs to the Platt on the south side of the river whare the Origon road first strikes the north fork of the Platt several  of the brethren went over in a boat that we were taking with  us and exhamined the rock bluffs, road, creek, andc and returned  with some ash. rock, wild curands and cherry andc we came on 8 3/4 miles and camped for the night we crossed a large  creek about 12 rods across it which we supposed it to be  a creek that Glos Cload called the Rawhiyde we had a vary good road most of the day on the bank of the  River, we have passed a good deal of rock bluff on both  sides of the river, and some on the south side of the river  was formed into natural terrices, rotundas, squairs andc 50  or 100 feet high looked liked good foundations to build  forts and fortications and strong holds upon they resemble  the work of art and look some like the old castles of Scotland they were level on the top. A short  distance above Ash Creek there is a beautiful ceder Island  in the river which is a good beacon to show travelers wha res the oregon road strikes the river. we have had a cool, windy, cloudy day whole distance 15 3/4 m   Brother Pratts carriage tongue into  the hind end of my carriage and broke in the end bord and the water came in when it rained so that it wet my  again things and to day Br Fowler run his waggon into it again to day but when I spoke to him about it he denyed it which caused some words between us. we had some little rain to day. The bluffs on the opposite side that I have  described above are named Castle Bluffs and the stream that was called  rawhide is called Castle Creek    ENDENTRY May 21, 1847 ~ Friday   21st Before we left the encampment Br Clayton put up a guide board  with the following inscription for the benefit of the next camp  from ceder  bluff 36 1/2 Fort Laramee we travled to day 7 1/2 miles and nooned in the afternoon 8 m and camped for the night. we saw 8 or 10 buffalo today but have not seen but few for several days we saw some deer and  antilope to day I killed a bagger with the jaw bone of a  buffalo. Just as we got to a camping place two Indians came  from the bluffs riding towards us and made signs for us to come  to them several of the brethren went, it was a Sioux Indian and his  wife they talked by signs awhile and went away distance of the day 15 1/2 miles   ENDENTRY May 22, 1847 ~ Saturday   22. The brethren found a part of a petrified leg bone of a Mamouth it was from the knee joint downward the piece was 17 inch  long. 11 inches wide and weighed 27 lbs. we travled to day 7 1/2  miles and onooned and in the afternoon 8 miles and camped for  the Sabbath, whole distance of the day 15 1/2 m   our road has been vary strait to day but we came over 2 1/2 miles  of the worst bluff sandy and hilly that we have past on  the rout. we have also past several large creek beds of  dry sand, the bluffs on our rout to day have presented  the most singular natural senery that I ever beheld in  my travels on the earth. It has the greatest appearance  of the old walls and ruins of the castles of Europe from  the size of chimneys to 100 feet square or more, bodies  of earth and rock that appears as though it was formed  out of clay stand erect scattering through the bluffs  from 10 to 100 feet high, with perpendicular  sides as strait as walls of a building while all  the earth around them have been washed away  to their base with rain and time. A spring of cold  water was found in the top of one of these peaks  apparently in a small basin of stone. there are  considerable number of rattle snakes come out of  these bluffs I sayw near a dozen to day a good  share of the rout this afternoon the face of the  earth is barren almost destitute of grass    ENDENTRY May 23, 1847 ~ Sunday   23rd ^Sunday^ In company with B Young and the Twelve we visited the  top of two of the highest bluff ruins that lie opposite our  encampment which were truly a curiosity. O. Pratt took a  barometrical observation on the ownly tree which was red ceder  on the top of the ruins or bluff which we visited we had  a fair view of chimney rock from whare we were. I  carried a bleached buffalo bulls head on to the top and  wrote upon it with a pencil our names and distances from  several places for the benefit of the next camp while  Br Fairbanks blank was on one of these bluffs he  was bit with a rattlesnake and became vary painful before  he reached camp the Brethren commenced giving  him such things as they thought best. And he soon was  better. The camp met at half past 11 ooclok. E Snow addressed  the Meeting and spoke well. President Young then addressed the  camp in an Interesting manner, said he was satisfyed that  the Lord was with us and Leading us had never seen a company  of people more united than the camp had been thus far on the  journey, that we should pluck the fruits of this mission to all  Eternity that he had many things to teach us but could not  do it ownly in a stake of Zion. But he was well satisfyed  with himself, his brethren the Twelve and the camp at large one  thing he would say to the praise of all, that was not one  had refused to obey his council on the road. His peace with  God was continually like a river and he felt that the spirit of  peace rested upon the whole camp. many good things were  said. Several other brethren followed him after which  meeting was dismissed. we intended to have rode out in the  evening, but we saw that a storm was gathering, and it soon  began to blow vary hard about as much as we could do to  save our waggons bows and covers from being smashed   ENDENTRY the hard wind continued for about an hour then it commenced  raining and which lasted about one hour accompanied with some hail it turned vary cold I had fears that some of our horses would  perish with the cold as such changes were freequent in this  region Mr Sarpee related a circumstance that transpired sev eral years since at about this place on the 22nd of May one  day earlier than this while travling down this fork of the platt it was warm weather the grass 10 inch high it began to rain  some in the afternoon and turned cold in the evening and before  morning 16 of his best horses were frozen to death by the side  of the waggons and his boates boats froze into the Ice in the river the changes are vary great in this country and when I see it  turning so cold I coverd all my horses with blankets that  I coudld I got up several times in the night to see to then It rained occasionally in the night. the horses shook with  cold but morning came and all was alive as soon as they were  let loose they run to warm themselves.    ENDENTRY May 24, 1847 ~ Monday   24th It was a cold morning yesterday morning the Thermometer  stood at 52°, at noon 82, and this morning 38 accompanied with  north wind, we travled 10 miles and nooned. I dreamed this mor- ning that some Indians came into camp in a friendly manner  and stole 6 horses before our eyes and rode off we gave them  chase on horsback and I awoke.   As soon as we camped  this noon two Indians came to the camp they were Sioux they were well dressed and clean we gave them some dinner  and showed them an Indian dog that had followed us several  days but the dog would not follow them they soon left the  camp. Chimney rock still grows plainer to our view we drove in the afternoon 6 1/2 miles and camped near the quick  sand mountain that run in a ridge from the river back that  apparently had been heaped up by the wind I rode about  two miles forward to find grass and a camping place and on  my return I saw about 30 Soux Indians Plunge their horses  Into the River on the opposite side and make towards us I rode  with several others to the river and met them as they came  out they shook hands with us, vary friendly, the Chief  unfurled a large American Flag with the Eagle stars and stripes  and presented me a Letter. It was written in french we  however made it out, they were all well dressed the Chief  was dressed in a military coat. the Brethren from Camp  brought a white flag and stuck down by the side of theirs they wanted to go into Camp we proposed for 5 of them  to go and the rest to remain in Camp but they all wiched  to come so we let them. we gave them supper they remained about camp all night, but were good and stole  nothing. distance of the day 16 1/2 —    ENDENTRY May 25, 1847 ~ Tuesday   25th The Sioux are in camp this morning we gave them  Breakfast they stayed with us untill we started some little  traiding was done they were men women and children they  crossed the river when we left and behaved well we drove  2 miles and dbated our horses, then drove untill 1 oclok and nooned then drove untill 6 oclok and camped for the night distance 12 m   I was unwell had the Rheumatism in shoulders and back and teeth ake had to keep the carriage I read Calafornia  He tells some great stories about California and oregon we camped  within about 4 miles of Chimney rock   ENDENTRY May 26, 1847 ~ Wednesday   26th we travled 6 1/4 miles and nooned in good grass about 2 miles  above Chimney rock we travled in the afternoon 6 1/4 miles  and camped for the night. The hunters brought in four Antelope we passed much good grass to day. I rode to day with Br Kimball  and Benson to look out the road I have during the last two days  read Mr Calafornia. He has  greatly exhagerated the account of upper Calafornia.   Just before camping at noon while travling on a smooth prairie  an accurance took place which liked to have proven of serious consequence to our camp. An Indian Horse that was bought of the Sioux ran away with a whi singletree to his heels and gave a trem- endious fright to the cows, oxen and horses that were attached to the waggons and in an instant a dozen or more waggons  were darting by each other like lightning and the horses and mules  flying as it were over the ground some turned to the right and  some to the left some run into other waggons, the horse and mule  that Br Fowler was driving leaped with all spead, with Br Little hold of the lines and Br Fowler hold of the bits they darted  by my carriage like electricity and came within one inch of a  collission with my wheels if they had locked we should have  been a wreck another waggon followed by in the same manner  with a pair of Mules and one yoke of cattle upon a keen run which  would also have smashed my carriage if they had hit it but  my own horses by this time started to run but was soon held up by the driver, Br Fowlers waggon continued to rooll regardless of rough or smooth ground for about fifty rods and  he draged the whole distance by the bit which was the  case with many others, but all was soon stoped and returned  to there lines without any accident to any team or waggon  which appeared to me truly a miricle William Smoots team run away also with great speed. It give us sumthing of an  Idea what an Indian yell would would do in such an encamp- ment with teams hitched to waggons. A person can hardly  concieve of the power that is manifest in animals esspecially mules when in such a fright. But I felt thankful that no  accident happened.   By an Imperfect measurment, by a Trigonometrical observation by the Sexton Professor Pratt made the Chimney rock to be 260 feet above the level of the river. distance of the day 12 1/2 m    ENDENTRY May 27, 1847 ~ Thursday   27th we started 15 m before 8 oclok travled in a strait line 8 mile and nooned in good grass Br Kimball and myself picked the road in the foornoon and it was left to me in the afternoon and I piloted the road in the afternoon as strait as any road that had been  made on the whole rout and picked out a camping ground on  the bank of the river in good feed we travled 5 3/4 miles 13 3/4   It should be understood that we are piloting a road for  the House of Israel to travel in for many years to come therefore it requires the greater care. The hunters brought in 5 Antilope to day. we camped at half past 4 oclock opposite Scotts Bluff at Lattitude 41º, 50', 52." the wedth  of the river 772 yards a wind soon arose accompanied by  thunder and lightning we had but little rain.   ENDENTRY May 28, 1847 ~ Friday   28th A cold rainy morning the camp concluded not to start untill it stop raining. so we started at 10 oclok and travled 11 1/2  miles and camped for the night on the bank of the river it was a damp cold day we passed alongside of a clear strem of water with some  beaver dams and houses upon it at one place it raised the water about  two feet which was lined with fish a good share of which was  speckled trout so the brethren informed me this is the first strea- m I have met with containing trout since I left the New  England States. Therefore I name it trout creek it was not more  than 3 miles long it arose from a large pure spring. it was but a little  above Scotts Bluffs FIGURE distance of the day 11 1/2   during the evening President Young called at my fire and seeing  several of the brethering playing dominoes in a waggon near by began to teach by saying that the devil was getting power over  the camp that for several days past nearly the whole camp had  drank into a spirit of card, checker, and domino playing and dancing  and the spirit of folley and if they did not spedily repent their  works, labours, and journey would be in vain that we should  not accomplish the object for which we had come but should be thwarted in it. He said the Camp did not quarel any to be  shure for the devel would not set them to quarreling as long  as he could draw them away gradually from duty and fill them with nonsens and folley, for the devil was vary cuning in dra- wing away the people of God. I felt the force of his remarks and thought them necessary. during the evening I went in to  the doctors waggon, read a chapter in the Book of Mormon and prayed with them. After which B Young H. C. Kimball  E. T. Benson and W. Woodruff met in council  in Br Youngs waggon and Br Young wrote some of the word of the Lord concerning the camp and expressed  his views and feelings concerning the camp that they must  spedily repent or they would be cursed, that they were  forgetting their mission and he had rather travel with  10 righteous men who would keep the commandments of God than the whole camp while in a carless manner and forgetting God, we stayed untill 10 oclok and retired to  rest    ENDENTRY May 29, 1847 ~ Saturday   29th A cold rainy morning. At 10 oclok the horn was blown  to gather up the horses and cattle which took more than an hours  after which President Young called the camp together and required each Captain to seperate or calle out his men and when  it was found all was present except two who had gone a  hunting he then addressed them, sumthing in the following language, I think I will take for my text to preach my sermon from, I am about to revolt from travling with this camp any further with the spirit they now possess, I had rather  risk myself among the savages with ten men that are men  of faith, men of mighty prayer men of God, than to be with this whole camp when they forget God and turn there hearts  to folley and wickedness, yea I had rather be alone, and I am  now resolved not to go any further with the camp unless  you will covenant to humble yourselves before the Lord and  serve him and quit your folley and wickedness, for a week past nearly the whole camp has been card playing, chequres and dominnoes, have occupied the attention of the brethren   ENDENTRY and dancing, and Nigering and Hoeing down all has been the bet  continually, now it is quite time to quit it, and there has been  trials and law suits upon evry nonsensical thing and if these things  are suffered to go on it will be but a short time befor you  will be fighting knocking each other down and taking life  and it is high time it was stoped, I do not want to hear any  more such reportts as I herd last Sunday. of mens going to  meeting and preaching to the rest after he had played cards  untill meeting time, you are a putty set of men going  to seek out a location among the mountains for a resting place of the Saints, even the whole Church of God who have been driven out from the gentiles and rejected of them and after  you have esstablished a location you are then going out to preah  the gospel, seal salvation upon the House of Israel, and gather  the nations. How would you look if they should know your  conduct and ask you what did you do when you went to  seek out Zion, and find a resting place for the Saints whare  the Standard of the Kingdom of God could be reared and her  banners unfurled for the nations to gather unto, dut you  spend a good deal of your time in dancing pitching quarel, Jumping wrastleing andc yes, yes, did you play cards, dice  checkers and dominoes O! yes, what could you do with you- rself, why you would shrink from the glance of the yeyes  of God Angels and men even wicked men, then are you  not ashamed of yourselves for practicing these things yes you are and you must quit it. After speaking sumwhat  lengthy upon these matters he called the Twelve together  the High priest, Seventies and Elders, and found to be 8  of the quorum of the Twelve. 18 High Priest. 80 Seventies  and 8 Elders after which President Young said unto the  Twelve If you are willing to humble yourselves before  the Lord and covenant to do right and walk humble before  him, make it manifest by raising the right hand when each one raised their hand, the same question  was put to the High Priest, Seventies, Elders and Members  and all universally covenanted with uplifted hand to humble  themselves before the Lord repent of their sins and keep  his commandments. President Young then spoke of those  who was not in the Church as there were sum present that  they would be protected in their rights but they must  not introduce wickedness in the Camp for it would not  be sufferd. He then spoke of the standard and ensign that  would be reared in Zion, to govern the Kingdom of God  FIGURE and the nations of the earth for evry nation  would bow the knea and evry tongue confess that  JESUS was the Christ and this will be the  standard. The Kingdom of God and his Laws and Judgment in  {the hands of his servants Ahman Christ} And on the standard would be a flag  of evry nation under heaven so their would be an invitation to all  Nations under heaven to come unto Zion, the Saints would have  to keep the Celestial law, and all nations and religions would  have to bow the knee to God and accknowledge that Jesus was  the Christ, but they would not be under the necessity of  being baptized or embracing the Gospel of Christ, but  they must acknowledge the right and reign of Christ   ENDENTRY then if they felt disposed to reject the gospel and be damned they had  a right to, and the Saints or inhabitants of Zion had no right to take from them their religion or persecute them on account of it or  trample upon their rights any way, neither should other nations  or religions trample upon the rights and privileges of the Saints who serve  and obey the Lord of and Keep his Commandments neither would that  be suffered as it has been in times past. And upon this principle  all men or religions may dwell with us in peace, if they will  keep the outward laws of the kingdom of God so as to acknowledg his  name and his right to reign and let us keep the law of the gospel and  obey his commandments undisturbed. After making other rem- arks he left the meeting in the hands of the rest of the Twelve Elder Young said  it was the word of the Lord unto him and was just as much binding  upon him as though it was a written Revelation and it was just  as much binding upon the whole camp as it was upon him and urged  the Saints to give heed to the teachings that were given.

Woodruff arose and said he had some things in his heart he  wished to say, that a burned child dreaded the fire. He had not  forgotton his journey in the Camp of 1834 and should he  live to the age of Matheusala he should not forget the hour when  the Prophet and Seer Joseph Smith stood upon the waggon  wheel and addressed that Camp and said that because they had  not harkened to his Councel but disobeyed, and transgressed  from time to time, that the die was cast and Judgment  must come that we should be visited by the destroying Angels And so we were and more than twenty of our numbers  fell by the stroke and we all suffered much in our feelings And I pray the Lord I may not see another such a time And I would now advise my brethren to be careful in keeping the Covenant  ywe have made lest by and by the word of the Lord come unto us as in  the days of Joseph and we cannot escape his judgment. I would  advise all the Brethren who have got cards to burn them up for  also checkers and dominoes, for if you keep your covenants you  have made you will have no time to use them and they will be  useless lomber on your hands. if you keep them for your children  they will ownly prove, a curse to them. And my prayer to God  is thayt we all may be enabled to keep all our covenants  with the Lord and each other I rejoice that the watchman  upon the walls or in our mids are quick to comprehend and warn  us of evil and reprove us when wrong that we may de saved and do  the will of God   Br S.

At the blowing of the horn I did not feel much like retiring to bed so I walked 1/2 a mile from the  camp on the bank of Deer Creek and found Br Clayton fishing with a hook. He had caught about two dozen good fish.

A young antelope had hid behind a bunch of sage to keep out of the way of the hunters I discoverd him and crawld up and caught him in my hands but he gave such a spring he cleared himself from me.   we rode our horses into the river to day several times to see if we could find a fording place but we could not find any as the stream had risen by the melting snows of the mountains, we passed some snow to day on the highest peaks distance of the day 17 m    ENDENTRY June 12, 1847 ~ Saturday   12th I started in the morning to go forward in company with Br Young Stud when suddenly he sprung upon my horse but instead of striking my horse he took my knee into his Jaw and bruised me considerable sunk one tooth to  the bone through three thicknesses of clothing and  one of them buck skin G A Smith and myself then rode on to the ferrying ground and found our detachment ferrying over the Missouri Company they paid the Brethren $1.50 cts per each waggon and load, and paid in flour at $2.50 per cwt, generally flour is considerd worth at the forts through this country at least $10 per cwt. It was difficult getting over the river they carried the goods over in a boat and drew the waggons over by hand with ropses but when the curant struck them they would freequently rool several  times over in the watter and smash their bows out they also came near drowning their horses and one man would have been lost if the brethren had not picked him out with  the boat, we saw also on the road whare the company had a run away of their teams a horse came runing among them and frightened their oxen and they all started to run two run up onto a bank and turned both waggons over with women and children in and bruised them much, smashed jars crockery, dishes, boxes and sundrys to peaces. one team run into the river and would probably have drowned and lost all had not a little boy jumped out beside the off ox which frightend him and he out run the other hawed off and run onto a sand bar he however kicked the boy against the wheel and the wheel knocked him down into the water which hurt him, but the seene ended without any loss of life.   The Blacksmiths had been to work for the Missouri Company got flour money andc the company of 5 traiders had camped near the brethren. Our hunters had been busily engaged in getting game, they had killed 5 fat buffalo 4 bear one  old she bear and 3 cubs, and shot at 2 griselly bear but did not get them those killed were the black bear. saw a plenty of antiope deer Elk and Mountain Sheep the mountains near us abound with bear and other game I found some buffalo meat the hunters were not agoing to save, so I cut out of the hump  of a buffalo about 40 lbs of good fat stake and spread it  to dry also tryed out about 8 lbs of good tallow   ENDENTRY I visited the traiders camp they also was drying fine fat  Buffalo, one of the bears feet that was killed measured  7 1/2 inches long 5 inch wide 2 1/2 inch thick two toe nails 2 3/4 inch  long 3/4 inch wide.

Brown, and another  man were out all night hunting. One of the men of the camp  started out at dark to go to the mountain to get some snow the distance looked so short he said he could go and return before 8 oclok and was foolish enough to make a bet of one dollar upon it, but he did not  get to the mountain by 8 oclok and about 10 oclok a company of hors- man was sent out with a bugle after him fearing the bears would  eat him up.   We had a meeting at 10 oclok H. C. Kimball addressed  the meeting in an interesting manner, and was followed by Br Young  who spoke upon the liberty of the gospel, showed what it done  for us, saved us daily, exhaulted us to glory immortality and eternal  life brought us evry good thing, but in doing this it did not  do away with the law of God or the dictation of the Almighty  Some thought they wanted their liberty to curse, swear, stray  whare they were a mind to, run over the mountains, not regard  the laws and rules of the Camp, but would that be liberty, not it  would lead to death and not life, the man that left the camp and went  to the mountains last night, had he have met a bear he would have had  the liberty to have run for his cli life, clumb a tree or been destroyed The way to worship God the most acceptable is to do each day the  vary things that will bring the most good to the human family there is a great differance to be seen between us as a camp and the  Missouri companies that are going the same road or a part of the way they curse and swear, rip and tare, and are a trying to swallow up the earth, but  though they do not wish us to have a place on earth the earth will soon  swallow them up and they will go to the land of forgetfulness, while the  Saints if faithful though they should suffer some privations here will  ultimately inherit the earth and increase in dominion power and glory untill  the Lord shall say to them, go to now make your thousands of worlds  and people them and make such laws to govern them as you are a mind  to for I Know you have no disposition to make any laws but those  that are good, for you always desired to do good on the earth, and  many other goodly words did he say unto our edefycation. He was  followed by O Pratt who exhorted us to give head to the teaching  we had herd and to improve our time in treasuring up usful knowledge  that we ought not to spend a moments time needlessly. Meeting  dismissed and the Twelve, Colonels, Captains, andc of the Camp  met at the Presidents waggon to consult upon what measures  to adopt to get across the river it was finally agreed to go immedi- ately to the mountains with a waggon and team for evry two tens  and get poolls and lash two or four waggons abrest to keep them  from turning over and float them across the river with boats and  ropes, so a company of horsmen started for the mountains and teams  draw the polls. In the evening the flour meal and bacon was  page covered distributed through the Camp equally that had been recieved  page covered from the Mo company for ferrying them over, it amounted to  page covered 1/2 lbs of flour 2 lbs of meal and a small peace of bacon to each  page covered individual in the Camp. It looked as much of a miricle to me   ENDENTRY to see our flour and meal bags replenished in the midst of the black  Hills as it did to have the Children of Israel fed with manna  in the wilderness. But the Lord has truly been with us on this  journey we have had peace and union in our midst, our horses and cattle  have been wonderfully preserved from death and accident on the  way and our waggons from breaking down. Great good will grow out  of this mission if we are faithful in keeping the commandments of God   I have taken great delight of late in reading the book of Mormon seeing  the great and glorious things revealed and recorded in that book and that we are  now trying to fulfill the great things or some of them that Lehi Nephi  Alma, Moroni, Isaiah and many other prophets had in view in the last  days in building up Zion, redeeming Israel, warning the Nations and  sealing salvation upon the meek of the earth and laying a foundation  that the earth may be prepared for the coming of the Mesiah.

I was quite unwell a part  of the day with ague in the face I walked out however with O Pratt about 3 miles onto some of the bluffs to view the country we saw  mountains to the North towering into the clouds, we judged they were not much short of 100 miles from us. we had our guns with us and  hunted some I shot one antelope cut his throat with a bullet and  he fell dead in his tracts. Br Pratt shot at another but did not  get him. this was the first antelope I ever Killed, I tried to back  him in to camp but could not do it well so I got two men to help  me. we had some heavy squals of wind and some rain in the  afternoon. In the evening many of us went over the river to  tie up our horses and when one company was coming back in the leather boat they filled it half full of water and came near  sinking    ENDENTRY June 17, 1847 ~ Thursday   17th Early this morning we swam our horses over the river, one  mule came near drowning by being tangled in a rope but the  curant carried him ashore and he made a live of it, the men  went to work to finish their ferry boat while the men contin ued to cross waggons on the raft. All of our company got over to day and the brethren crossed some of the Missourians, Some of the eme grants report 1000 waggons between Laramie and this place and there compan ies are ariving daily at the fording places, Brs Kimball got over to day and we all moved our waggons once more into a circle. this  is the 6th day since our arival to this place which is the longest hender- ance I ever saw at a ferry or crossing a river. Our brethren run the  the ferry boat all night to cross the Missourians but did not get over but few waggons. I am still in much pain with the teeth ake and  sore lips and mouth. I had the privlege of milking a Mo cow which gave me a plenty of milk for Supper and breakfast    ENDENTRY June 18, 1847 ~ Friday   18th We are still ferrying over the gentiles. Another large company arived to day. Bro Frosst mad me some nails and set two shoes for me on my Saddle Horse, we commenced gathering cattle at 10 oclok  and harnessed but did not start at all, but turned our teams  again, as all were not ready. We held a council in the after noon and resolved to leave 9 men to tend the ferry  to cross emegrant companies and also our brethren who  should come after us, the men were chosen and we met with them again in the evening, one Brother had petiti- oned to stay that President Young wished to go along with the com- pany his name was Glines he did not manifest a good spirit  and Br Young reproved him. He then delivered a short lecture which was interesting and instructive, and said that when he  gave a man council he did not want him to reject that council or to bring up many arguments to try to alter it for  when a man did it I will turn on my heel and leave him. He  sayes there is another principle that has tried many in the Church  because more will follow me than some Young Elder who has not proved himself but if he was to try to gather to  himself the fruits of the labours of the Twelve and other men  would that be right. No he would be pulling back that that  page covered was before him but let the Elders do as I have done and my page covered Brethren the Twelve and other faithful men go and preach the  page covered gospel for years and do the will of God and you would have a train   ENDENTRY following you even the fruits of your own labour and you would  be putting them after you, and not drawing back that which is  before you, the Lord is determined to esstablish his kingdom in  the last days and He will have a faithful diligent and obedient people  and He chastizes the Saints to keep them humble and make them do  thereir duty if we had not been mobed and afflicted but always  been in prosperity we should have been lifted up in the pride of  our hearts and not gathered together and built up Zion as we ought to  have done, so that these trials will work together for our good.   Instructions was also given to the Brethren who were to tarry to keep  to gether and be united, divide the means equally among yourselves according to your labour, let each essteem his brother as himself. In no  wise retain that which belongeth to the traveller, steal not at all, be  careful of the lives and property of those you ferry over, and forget not your prayers keep together and come up with the next company of Saints   The following are the names Wm Empy  Appleton  Harmon. Thomas Grover was appointed captain    ENDENTRY June 19, 1847 ~ Saturday   19th we parted with the brethren who were to att end the ferry and the camp moved on having been  one week we travled through a barren country  to willow springs ^a spring of water^ and nooned being 12 miles, we past the red butes and many rough picturesque  sceneries and camped at night by the poison waters travled 9 1/2 miles in the afternoon whole distance 21 1/2   Our camping place for the night was the most wretched of any ground  we have found on the way President Young thought it might properly  be called Hell gate. All the water tasted as though it run through  a bed of salt, salts, saltpeter, sulpher the it was naucious horrible the ground in the valleys and marshes was apparently one half of it  composed of the saline floresance or salty substance of which this  country abounds. Our horses and cattle being thirsty drank a  little of the watter and quit it some of the cattle got badly miered  in the marshes. The traiders informed us these grounds wers poison and would kill cattle but ours did not drink much or feed  long we tied them up. The hunters brought in one buffalo and  one deer and 3 antelope    ENDENTRY June 20, 1847 ~ Sunday   19 20th Sunday we hitched up early in the morning without feed or watering and left our encampment of death, poison waters,  salt marshes andc and rode 3 miles to a good camp ground and sweet  water and turned out and bated 2 hours and took breakfast. this  camp ground was on the willow spring branch about 3 miles from  the head, President Young wished me to go on about 15  miles and look up a camp ground for the night, so I went forward G. A. Smith went with me to the head of the willow springs we there found a doctor belonging to a Missouri company who  had been doctoring a sick family in a company that was  forward. He was of opinion that the willow springs were  still 10 miles ahead which was incorrect as he was then  sitting at the head of them. Br Smith stoped with the  dDr to wait for our waggons to come up and I rode on alone After travling several miles Br John Brown came up  with me and we rode on together over a sandy barren, sage  country to a creek of good water containing some small  fish about 10 miles west of the willow springs we arived here   ENDENTRY at half past 1 oclok we turned out our horses to bait and tarried untill 4 oclok  watching for our company to come in sight, but we could see no  waggons but saw two horsman approaching us, we waved a small  flag for them to come to us supposed they were some of our company, but  they were two hunters Capt Smith and another man from the Mo co mpany carrying in buffalo meat to there camp they thought we were  Indians in the distance and made off. I mounted my horse and put after  them and soon overtook them, and made inquiries about our camp they said they had not seen it, but had seen a company of about  a dozen waggons coming by themselves, I then concluded our camp  had stoped at the willow Springs, so Captain Smith who was the  leader of the Mo Company invited us to go on and camp with them for  the night as they did not expect to go but a few miles further than the  creek we were now on. As it was 5 oclok and we could see 5 miles on  the road back and no waggons in sight I concluded our company would  not come on and if they should they would go no further than the  creek so we accepted Capt Smith proposal and went on with him  to spend the night with his camp dut insted of his going but little  distance he continued on mile after mile and could neither find feed  or water except the salt and alkalie ponds and lakes untill we struck  the Indipendance Rock which is so noted  in Freemonts Journal and other travellers which was about 12 miles west  of the creek before spoken off their oxen had tiered out having  travled about 27 miles and much of the road vary sandy and we had  road about FIGURE 30 miles and was quite weary, the sweet water is  truly sweet to man and beast after travling through so  much ground coverd with salt, perlash, and alkilie water as is found  on the way we turned out our horses in good feed got supper which  was bacon, buffalo, corn bread, coffee Milk andc then lay down  upon the ground and spent the night under a tent with the Missour- ians but did not rest well. I found a great differance between the  Missouri emigrant companies and our own, for while the men, women  and children were all cursing, swaring, quarelling, scolding finding  fault with each other and other companies, there was nothing of the  kind allowed or practiced in our own camp. But to return to  our camp I will say at a late hour they came up to the Creek that  we left back 12 miles, and grass being poor continued on 4 miles  west of the creek and camped for the night they travled 20 miles  while I travled 30 miles. 30 miles   The camp not finding me at the creek nor hearing from me  at all felt some alarmed lest I was lost, or got into trouble with  the Indians or some difficulty they blowed their bugle and  watched for me untill midnight and finally fired there cannon  while I was camped 10 miles from them not thinking that I  was giving them any trouble    ENDENTRY June 21, 1847 ~ Monday   21st 1847  June FIGURE INDEPENDANCE ROCK I arose early this morning  took breakfast and in  company with Br Brown  we rode clear around Independance Rock I should  judge the distance to be about 3/4 of a mile, we exhamined the many  names and lists of names of the trappers, traders, travellers, and emegrants  which are painted upon those rocks nearly all the names were put  on with read, Black, and yellow paint, some had washed out and defaced the greatest number was put on within a few Years some of them  were quite plaim of about 30 years standing nearly all the Companies   ENDENTRY pass by put some of their names on the rock After going around and  exhaminedng it we staked our horses and mounted the rock I  went forward and gained the highest point of the South end of the  Rock which containes the names. After exhamineing it I then went to  the North end which is the highest part of the rock, here is an opening  or cavern that would contain 30 or 40 persons and a rock stands on the  highest peak of about 3 tons wait. we got upon this rock and offered up  our prayers according to the order of the priesthood, we prayed earnestly  for the blessings of God to rest upon President Young and his brethren  the Twelve and all of the Pioneer Camp and the whole Camp of  Israel and House of Israel, our wives and children, and relatives  the Mormon Battalion, all the Churches abroad and that the  Lord would hasten the time of the fulfillment of his prom- ises to Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Lehi, Nephi, Alma, and  Moroni and all the sayings of the Lord of the Lord concerning  the building up of Zions in the last days and avenging the  blood of the Prophets and while offering up our prayers  the spirit of the Lord desended upon us and we truly felt  to rejoice and while we were attending to our prayers the Missou- rians was burying a woman a little distance from the  rock by the name of Rachel Morgan 25 years of age being  the third one of the family buried on the road they were  supposed to be poisoned by cooking in new copper vessels After surveying the rock what we wished we again  desended to the ground. I was the first Latter Day Saint  that ever went onto that Rock or offered up prayers according to the  order of the Priesthood. We had a view of our camp from this rock and  expected they would noon there so we mounted our horses and concluded  to examine the country in the regions round about we rode to the North  East about 5 miles went to the top of a high bluff and saw the camp  in motion we then rode to the foot of the Mountain to the N.W. and followed  under the foot of the mountain all of the way to the Devils gate through  which the Sweet water runs, while taking this circuitous rout  we passed a salt lake covering about 50 acres of Ground, we spent  but few minutes at the Devils gate at this time and hurried on toback to  the Rock as our camp had come up but before we could get to them  they had camped half a mile east of the Rock I met Br Young  going up to the Rock I related to him my travels since I left the camp He asked me to go back with him to the rock, so I told turned out my  horse having rode all of 20 miles during the forenoon exhamining  bare rugged rocks and barren grounds and salt ponds andc and I returned  with President Young G. A. Smith and others and we again  ascended the rock together and spent about half an hour upon it and  returned to camp mounted our horses and rode to the Devils gate which  is the name of the channel through the Mountain through which the  sweet waters run. It is 5 miles from Indipendance Rock and  while approaching this place from the rock as is the case while approach- ing the foot of any mountain through this country a person is  greatly decieved in the distance for while An object appears but a mile  ahead of you you will have to ride 5 or 6 before you can reach it we rode as far as we could into the gate hitched our horses and walked  into about the centre of the cavern. This opening or Devils gate is  400 feet high perpendicular Rocks 120 feet wide and 50 rod's long  and the water rushes through it with a roar, the rocks are composed  page worn of coarse grey granite with a vein of black trap rock runing   ENDENTRY through it we spent about half an hour visiting this place then had to  back out and ride around it on the south side some of the footman  walked over the top of it we camped for the night on the bank of   the Devils gate the camp having travled during the day 15 1/4 miles and I 30 miles. Distance 15 1/4 m 30 miles  A guide board was put up at the gate saying it was  175 1/4 miles from the Fort Laramie, and 50 1/4 from the ford 22nd or ferry of the Platt River    ENDENTRY June 22, 1847 ~ Tuesday   22nd we travled 10 miles and nooned. Br Lorenzo Young broke an axeltree of his waggon which detained the camp some, two more Missouri companies  overtook us at noon, the camp started on and Brs Little  and myself, went back to meet Lorenzo and help him get up his waggon and  we were behind all the afternoon. A company that arived at noon  informed us that a man was drowned at the ferry after we left in  trying to swim his horses across and they had not found his body when  they left, two men also got some alarmed at the Indipendance  Rock by a large griselly bear they stoped to put their names on the  Rock and the company left them they started to follow on, one man was on foot and the other on a horse and were met in the road by a griselly  bear who made a tract 10 inch long, they had no weapons not even a knife the Bear sat up and looked at them a few moments and walked off and they came along, the griselly bear are more apt to attact men than any other  kind.   We travled in the afternoon 10 3/4 miles and camped at the foot of a mound about 200 feet high, on the bank of the Sweat water Br Kimball and mysel went to the top of it and looked down upon the  camp and it look heavenly. we offered up our prayers and the spirit of the  Lord rested upon us we descended again to the camp the moon shone beautiful. during the evening the brethren put in a new axeltree into  Br Lorenzo' waggon. distance of the day 20 3/4 miles    ENDENTRY June 23, 1847 ~ Wednesday   23rd We travled in the forenoon 8 1/2 miles and nooned by the Sweet water  with the mountains piled up near by us our road to day has been  through a level, sandy, barren sage region for a mountain country we travled in the afternoon 8 1/2 miles and camped on the bank of the Sweetwater  whare the road leaves it for about 20 miles across the sandy sage plains  without water or feed, we had excellent grass for our camp at night we are in plain view of the Rocky Mountains at the pass and beyound we had a vary sandy draging road all day whole distance 17 miles    ENDENTRY June 24, 1847 ~ Thursday   24th We travled to day 5 miles and came to the frozen or Lee spring  and stoped and exhamined it and found the spring to be strongly impregnated  with sulpher so much so it could not be drank the water would boil up out of a peace of bog ground yet all around it it was so cold that after removing the turf about 6 inch a solid body of Ice was found about 18 inches  thick some of it we cut up with axes and spades. near this was small ponds  page covered of water salt and saltpeter and sulpher and peotash seemed to be in the body of the water, pure perlash was found in such quantities on the edges of  these waters that the brethren gatherd pailfulls of it to raise bread with others would fill their cups with salt so pure from other mixtures that  they used it we travled from this place 12 3/4 miles and camped upon the bank of the Sweet water two days 18 miles from the foot of the pass page covered 3 companies camped near us to night, this is the last time we shall see  the sweet water on this journey we did not bait to day but camped  at 4 oclok whole distance of the day 17 3/4 miles   Br Youngs team run away with a waggon I cought them by the bit just as they were about to plunge into the stream   ENDENTRY Soon after we camped Br Holman was driving up the horses  with his gon in his hand. He went to punch a horse with the musel of his gun the lock caught in his cloths and discharged into the best horse the best horse there was in camp owned by  president Young called his John Horse. He lived a few hours and died there are many accidents happen in that way by  caring loaded guns with caps upon their tubes.    ENDENTRY June 25, 1847 ~ Friday   25th we travled 8 3/4 miles and nooned upon a branch of  the sweet water in as good grass as we have had on  the way early in the afternoo we began to ascend the high est and longest hill that we have passed over on the journey we travled about 5 miles before we reached the top on the way up the brethren found snow banks 20 or 30 rods  long from 5 to 10 feet deep about 1/4 of a mile from  the road they brought some to me and I ate some the road was vary rocky a part of the way over the  hills. we passed by 3 Mo camps who had passed by us we travled in the afternoon 11 1/2 miles and camped  for the night on a small branch of the sweet water  the chain of the wind River mountain seemed quite near us and covered with vast quantities of  snow and we are so near the top of the mountain and surrounded with snow that the air feels like  winter whole distance of the day 20 1/4 mi our teams fed upon white clover to night we are  nearly at the head of the sweet water    ENDENTRY June 26, 1847 ~ Saturday   26th We started this morning at 8 oclok and travled untill 1 oclock  and nooned again on the branch of the Sweet much larger than original stream in consequence of the melting of the vast body of snow on the wind river range, and the hills that surround us the watter run into many of our waggons; whare we camped  at noon there was a large quantity of strabury vines in bloom and white clover we travled in the forenoon 11 miles and in the afternoon 7 3/4 miles and camped again upon the branch of the  sweet water that we nooned upon, we camped opposit the  dividing  ridge and I was quite asstonished at the road and country to day considering that we were crossing what is called the  south pass of the rocky mountains it was the best road we  had for many days and had it not have been for the wind  river range of mountains full in view on our right and the tabl coverd with eternal snow, and some snow banks 10 feet  deep by the side of the road as we passed along and the table  rock on the left I should have thought myself traveling over the beautiful prairies of Missouri except the  country was coverd with more sage that prairie grass  the road for many miles and also the valley of or plain of  beautiful grass lying North of table rock was perfectly  strewn with vary handsom cornelian stones I saw more in one hour this evening than I ever saw during my whole life either in the rude state or polished  and set in breast pins in all the jewellers shops I ever saw  in my travels in the world from the sice of a goose egg to a pea. distance of the day 18 3/4.   ENDENTRY Elders Brown continued on to take an  observation with the Barrometer on the dividing ridge and they con- tinued on to the waters of the green river 7 miles from us that  run into the Sweet water that runs  into the Atlantic; they supposed we should come on to them and  as they did not return several of us mounted our horses to go in  search of them soon after we started we met Br Kimball  on his return after us. He informed us that the Brethren  were camped with about one dozen men from Oregon on  there way to the States and they would stay together over night FIGURE   During our travels to day I walked most of the way with Profess- ors Pratt, and Carrington and our conversation turned upon the  subject of the original formation of God, Angels, men, and Devils  the begetting of Spirits in the eternal world, and who by, the beget- ing of children on the earth, the Death of men and children and the  resurrection of all. Each one gave his views, opinions, and reasonings and many interesting remarks were truly made. And any person  who should chance to read these lines I wish them to understand that  the Ideas given upon these points were not given as doctrin but opi- nion untill sumthing better should present itself or be decided by  revelation. One of the most important Items If true was pre- sented by Professor Pratt upon a subject that heretofore has ben  entirely out of the reach of all mankind from the days of Adam  to the present time as far as is revealed to us. It was upon the subjec  of the original formation of the first God, we all admitted in the  first place that which we believed to be an important truth ie the eternal  duration of matter spirit, intelligence in some form or other we also  agreeed in the opinion that Neither God nor man always had from all eternity the same formation that they now have but did exhist in  some form for if we admitted the fact that one being exhisted in  the present form all might have exhisted in the same form as well as one, then the question arose how did God recieve his present formation the answer given by Professor Pratt was sumthing in the following  language. He sayes I throw out my Ideas not as doctrin but for you  to look at. you know when a Chemist goes to work to analize or  try new experiments they often have to try many times before they  get a thing perfect and take certain processes which are unnecessary and are  afterward laid aside and pursue the most perfect course that can be  obtained. It may reasonably have been the case with the first being  formed which may be called God. As eternity was filled as it were  with particles of intelligence who had there agency, two of these  particles in process of time might have joined their interest together  exchanged ideas and found by persueing this course that they gained  double strength to what one particle of intelligence would have and  afterwards were joined by other particles and continued untill they  formed a combination or body though through a long process yet  they had power over other intelligences in consequence of their  combination, organization, and strength and in process of time this  being body or God seeing the advantage of such an organization  desires company or a companion and having some experiance  goes to work and organizes other beings by prevailing intelligences to  come togeth and may form sumthing better than at the first and after trials of this kind and the moust perfect way sought  ought it was found to be the most expeditious and best way to recieve  there formations or bodies either spiritual or temporal through  the womb   ENDENTRY June 27, 1847 ~ Sunday   June 27th 1847 Three years ago this day the Prophets Joseph  and Hyrum Smith were martered.    Though it was  Sunday morning we harnessed up our teams and drove 6 miles to  the place whare Brs Smith camped in company with  Mr Harris who has been a traider and trapper in the rocky mou- ntains and travled through Calafornie 25 years we found  him to be a man of much experience and knowledge and acquaintance  with the Country. He brought a file of Oregon Papers and one  Published by S Brannon of Calafornia many of us had  much conversation with him about the Country He spoke  unfavorable of the Salt Lake Country for a settlement but spoke of other places not far off that were good. He said we  generally could go through the pass as late as November  but should we get blocked in with snow we would would find a small stream of water 4 or 5 miles from the Devils  gate near Independance rock this stream is 5 miles west of  the gate follow that up a short distance and it would lead  to a road that crosses it to the west which would lead to a  through a large plain following to the mountains whare  there is but little snow when you come to the pass or  hill get onto some of them and you will see a large  bute leave it to the blank hand and follow down blank And it will lead into the open valleys see * below   It is 275 1/2 miles from fort Laramie to the South pass   At 9 oclok this morning I passed the dividing ridge  that seperates the dividing waters of the Atlantic  and muddy creek  the waters of which run into the green river and the  pacific I drank its waters for the first time in my life that I tasted of waters runing into the pacific we had a warm dusty day I conversed considerably  with Mr Harris about the country we camped at  night upon dry sandy whole distance 15 1/4 mil   * 3 miles above the gate look to the South you will see an open pass in  the Mountains go through that and let your Course be west till you top  the hill out of the great plain, then look to the south you will see a  square bute leave that to the left go on and cross the green River then let  your course be west to Bridgers Fort, (And I think) he said we should  go by blacks fork    ENDENTRY June 28, 1847 ~ Monday   28th we parted with Major Harris after doing some traiding with  him He promised to meet us again on bear River, we travled to little Sanday and nooned the stream was high, in the afternoon  we travled 2 miles and met Mr Bridger of the fort on the way  with two other men going to fort Laramie. He was expecting us and was to have an interview with President Young and the Twelve and also we  wished to have an interview with thehim. So we immediately turned onto the creek we nooned on and camped for the night and Mr  Bridger and his men camped with us, we met in council and spent  some hours in conversations, we found him to have been a great  traveller and a great knowledge of nearly all Calafornia   the Mountains, lakes, Rivers, Brooks, springs, valleys, mines, ores, andc and  ie if what he told us was true. He knew of gold, silver, copper, lead, coal  Iron, Sulpher and Salpeter, mines. He spoke more highly of the great   ENDENTRY page covered Basin  for a settlement than Major Harris did, that it was his page torn  and if this people settled in it he wanted to settle with them, there page torn  but one thing that could operate against it becoming a great grain page torn  country and that would be frost. He did not know but the frost would  effect the corn. He said there was a spring at the end of the Salt lake  that produced both hot and cold fresh water, and hot and cold salt water  out of the same hole or spring, and formed a large body of verdegreece  below which the Indians get to paint skins, arrors andc. He informed  us whare to find a mine of silver and lead ore on big timber Creek we  conversed about a great variety of things. He said he was ashamed of  the Maps of Freemont for he knew nothing about the country ownly the plain travled road, that he could correct all the maps that  had been put out about the western world. He said if we wanted  any of his services to let him know, the American fir Company had  paid him $2000 dollars per year while in their employ. He spent the  time conversing untill 10 oclok, we then retired to bed several of  the brethren bought dressed deer skin shirts and pants of him then they would swap an outside dress for one Hickory or Checked shirt. We had good grass and water and plenty of musketoes to night dis 15 1/2    ENDENTRY June 29, 1847 ~ Tuesday   29th we parted this morning with Mr Bridger who remarked that  it would not be prudent to bring a great population into the  bason untill we ascertained whether grain would grow or not  we travled on to big Sandy 8 miles and nooned it was a vary hot  day, these streams are now up but during Summer they become  entirely dry, we nooned two hours and then drove onto the bank  of the Big Sandy 15 3/4 miles and camped for the night this campground is the last time we meet with Big Sandy 8 miles east of the ferry  on green River the road to day, as has been the case through a great portion of this country has been over a hot sandy desert with  scearsly any green thing except the various species of the wild sage  from 6 inches to 8 feet high with stocks from 1/4 of an inch to 4 inches  in diameter we have to use it for firewood and it makes quite a good  substitute. O. P. Rockwell and myself went forward to pick out a camp  ground we was ahead about 6 miles of the camp when we found  one which was the first place we could get grass for 15 miles  from whare we nooned, it made the longest days journey  we had made on the whole route. I returned to meet the camp page covered about 4 miles and was informed that Br Fowler was vary sick  and in my carriage I went back and met him and found him in great  distress in his head, back, and bones through out. He complained bitt rly of the jar of the waggon. And finally was out of his head and  became wild. I did not get into camp untill near 9 oclok, I then  commenced doctoring him with composition, tea, pills andc and he  soon began to get better and had a comfortable nights rest distance of the day 23 3/4    ENDENTRY June 30, 1847 ~ Wednesday   30th Br Fowler was some better this morning seemed to be threatned  with the ague kept his bed and rode in the waggon, we travled  8 miles and camped upon the bank of the green river at the ferry and the  afternoon was spent in building a raft as the river was high it  could not be crossed ownly upon rafts or boats. It was 235 1/2 miles  from the rocky mountains   During the afternoon the arival of Elder Samuel S Brannan from  the bay of San Francisco was anounced in camp, we were truly glad to page covered meet with him that we might hear from him and the Saints who were page covered with him.

On this important day after traveling  from our encampment 6 miles through the  deep ravene, valley, ending with the canion  through last creek we came in full view  of the great valley or Bason of the Salt Lake  and land of promise held in reserve by the hand of GOD for a rest- ing place for the Saints upon which a portion of the Zion of  GOD will be built, we gazed with wonder and admiration upon  the vast rich fertile valley which lay for about 25 miles in  length and 16 miles in wedth clothed with the heaviest garb of  of green vegitation in the midst of which lay a large lake of  salt water of blank miles in extent in which could be seen  large Islands and mountains towering towards the clouds also the  glorious valley abounding with the best fresh water springs  rivlets creeks and brooks and rivers of various sizes all of which  gave animation to the sporting trout and other fish while the  waters were wending there way into the great salt lake; our  hearts were surely made glad after a hard journey from  Platt Rivers  and steeps of the Rocky mountains and burni ng sands of the eternal sage regions and willow swails and Rocky  canions and stubs and stones, to gaze upon a valley of such vast  extent entirely surrounded with a perfect chain of everlasting  hills and mountains coverd with etrnal snow with there  innumerale peaks like pyramids towering towards Heaven presen ting at one view the grandest and most sublime scenery Probably that  could be obtained on the globe. Thoughts of pleasing meditations  ran in rapid succession through our minds while we contemplated  that not many years that the House of GOD would stand upon  the top of the Mountains while the valleys would be converted into  orchard, vineyard, gardings and fields by the inhabitants of Zion and  the Standard be unfurled for the nations to gather there to President Young expressed his full satisfaction in the appearanc  of the valley as a resting place for the Saints and was amply  repayed for his journey.   After gazing awhile upon the scenery  we travled across the table land into the valley 4 miles to the  encampment of our Brethren who had arived 2 days before us, they had pitched there encampment upon the bank of two  small streams of pure water and had commenced plowing had broke about 5 acres of ground and commenced planting  potatoes.

At the close of the meeting President Young though  feble addressed for a few moments and Informed the brethren  FIGURE they must not work on Sunday that they would loose five times as much as they would gain by it and they  must not hunt or fish on that day and there should not any  man dwell among us who would not observe these roles they might  go and dwell whare they pleased but should not dwell with us He said that no man should buy any land that come here that he  had no land to sell neither should he buy any but evry man should  his land measured of to him for city and farming purposes what  he could till and he might till it as he pleased but he should be industrious and take care of it He also warned the Saints against keeping any thing that did not belong to them that if they followed this course it would leek out and they would stink in the norstrils of Jehovah Angels and the Saints and though they might live with the  saints and die with them they would be damned at last and go to Hell for they were thieves and nothing but burning through Hell  would clens them.

I took President Young into my carriage and travled two miles towards the mount^a^in and made choice of a spot of ground for our garding with a small rivlet runing through  it sufficient to irrigate it which I named guarding creek we then returned to camp and went North of the camp about 5 miles and we all went unto the top of a high Peak in the edge of the mountain which we  considerd a good place to raise an Ensign upon which we named ensign  Peak or Hill. ^I was the first person that ascended this Hill^ Brother Young was vary weary in climing the Peak he  being feble, we then desended to the flat — started north to visit some  hot sulpher springs but we returned two miles to get a drink of cool water and then went back 4 miles to the springs we found them vary  warm but not hot, 3 or 4 of the springs ished issued green water and formed  substance below that looked like verdigreese. After visiting them we returned to camp quite weary.

We started for the purpose of visiting the salt lake and mou ntain on the west of the valley we travled ^2^ miles west from  the Utah lake we then travled ^14^ miles to the foot of the Bluff or mountain  on the west of the valley whare we found a fountain of fresh water some brackish the land was not near as fertile on the  west side of the valley as on the east. And but little fresh water as far as we went while the east side of the valley is as well wattered as any land I ever saw. we took our dinner at the fresh water pool and then rode 6 miles to a large rock on the shore of the Salt lake we here ^we^ made a halt. And all went into the salt  water and we made up our minds at once that the great Salt  lake ought to be added as the eigtht wonder of the world, the watter was quit warm and was impregnated with as much  salt as could possibly be dissolved in water ist was so strong  that if a particle got into the eyes nose or mouth it would  strangle and put one in pain no person could possibly sink in it A person would float and rooll on the top of the water like a dry  log and while standing to our waist in water we could not get our knees to the bottom but would rise to the top like a  cork, we found the most beautiful white salt that I ever saw lying in bunches on the shore whare the water dryed away, the whole  dody of the water will make at least 3 pints of the best quality of white salt to one gallon of water.

I having lost my carriage whip the evening before 4 miles  back I started in the morning on horsback to go back after it, as I  got near the place I discovered two objects appear on a ridge before me  About 1/2 a mile distant I at first took them to be bears but after approach ing a little nearer I discovered about 20 objects appearing over the Hill I  soon saw that they were Indians and as I was unarmed and over 3 mi  from camp I did not consider it prudent to go among them I wheeled my horse and started on my return in a slow trot as soon as I started back  they called to me and one mounted his horse and came after me with all speed when he got within 20 rods of me I stoped and met him the rest followed on I found them to be Utahs and wanted to trade I informed him by  signs that our camp was near so he went on with me to camp, what we  have seen as yet of the Utahs they appeare friendly and not disposed to steal  from us though they have a bad name from some of the mountaineers. He  stoped in camp awhile and wanted to smoke the pipe of peace but we soon started on and he waited for his company to come up, we travled about  10 miles south under the mountain on the west side of the valley the land lies beautiful but we could not rest of line covered   ENDENTRY soil as on the east, we then turned our course and returned toward camp we had to travel 20 miles across the vale to get to the ford of the outlet we here stoped eat and drank and returned to camp quite weary having travled during the day about 30 miles   we saw on the west side of the valley about 75 or 100 mountain  goats, sheep, antilope andc in flocks playing about the hills and valley.   FIGURES After we arived in camp President Young called a Council of  the quorum of the Twelve there being present B Young  G. A. Smith E. T. Benson. we walked from the north camp to about  the centre between the two creeks when Prest. Young waved his  hands and said here is the forty acres for the Temple (we had conve- rsed upon the subject of the location for the Temple previous to this) and the city can be laid out perfectly square North and South, east and  west. It was then moved and carried that the Temple lot contain  40 acres on the ground whare we stood. It was also moved and  carried that the city be laid out into lots of 10 rods by 20 each exclusive of the Streets and into blocks of 8 lots each, being 10  acres in each block and one acre and a quarter in each lot. It was also  moved and carried that each street be laid out 8 rods wide and  that there be a side walk on each side 20 feet wide and that each  house be built in the centre of the lot 20 feet from the front  line that there might be a uniformity through out the city and  President Young remarked that he wished but one house built upon  a lot and they being in the centre if they took fire they would not  burn up their neighbors and if any man wants a Market to hous it upon his own lot and not lay out publick grounds for markets and let  every man cultivate his own lot and set out evry kind of fruit and  shade trees and beautify the City. It was Moved and carried that there be four public squares of 10 acres each be laid of in various  parts of the city for public grounds. This was in Lat 40º 45 44 At 8 oclok the whole camp came together on the same ground and  passed all of the above votes unanimously as they are recorded  and when the business part of the meeting was closed President  Young arose and addressed the assembly in a vary interesting manner upon a variety of subjects. Previous to this the whole assembly voted  that there be a committee to superintend the laying out the City and  that the Twelve be that committee and that they manage the whole  affair.   President Young in his address to the Saints remarked that  he was determined to have order in all things and righteousness should be  practized in this land. That we had come here according to the direction  and council of Br Joseph Smith before his death and that he would still have  been alive if the Twelve had been in river from Nauvoo Montrose to Nauvoo. He spoke of the Saints being driven from place to place, and said the ownly way Lucas, Benton, and all the leaders of the mob could have been saved in the day  of the Lord Jesus would have been to have come forward voluntarily and let their heads been cut off and let their blood run upon the ground  and gone up as a smokeing incens before the heavens as an atonement  but now they will be eternally damned. Also said all the governors  and Presidents of the U.S.A had rejected all our petitions from first  to last, that when the Saints were driven from Illinois and perish  as it were on the Prairies then President Polk sends for a draft of  500 men to go into the Army what for, that they might be wasted page covered be wasting and it was that page covered   ENDENTRY entirely wasted away as a people, if the brethren had not gone  they would have made war upon us and the Govr. of Mo would have been  ordered not to have let us cross the Missouri and the raising of the Battalion  was our temporal Salvation at the time and said Polk would be damned  for this act and that he with many of the goverment men had a hand in the death of Hyram and that they should be damned for  these things and if they ever sent any men to interfere with us here  they shall have there throats cut and sent to Hell, and with uplifted  hands to Heaven swore by the Gods of Eternity that he would never  cease his exhertion while he lived to make every preperation and avenge  the Blood of the Prophets and Saints, that he intended to have evry hole and corner from the Bay of Francisco to Hudson bay known  to us and that our people would be connected with every tribe of  Indians throughout America and that our people would yet take their  squaws wash and dress them up teach them our language and learn them to  labour and learn them the gospel of there forefathers and raise up children  by them and teach the children and not many generations hence they will  become a white and delightsome people and in no other way will it be done  and that the time was nigh at hand when the gospel must go to that peop- le. He said he long spoken of giving a lecture to the females and when he got time he intended to do it. He spoke of the duty orf man to his God  that he should love him with all of his heart soul, mind, and strength serve  and obey him, and that the woman in like manner ought to obey her husband page torn and not to have a woman every time a man steped out be a watching him  as uneasy as a fish out of water and as soon as he returns O whare have  you been, and what have you been about, and why did you not get back before  and many other things that was none of her business. Her business is to take care of her children keep herself clean and house and keep my close clean Instead of that the husband asks whare is the Children the wife will say  O dear I dont know I was so concerned about you I have not thought about the Children, they are probably to some of the neighbors.   He remarked  that when we become settled here he intended to have a school for his  own family and all others might do the same if they chose or join togeth er and a tutor ought always to be with the children and not let them  get out of their sight and when they get weary of runing about in the  house and garding let the tutor go with them to the public walks and keep  them out of the streets and see that they do not sware and take the name page torn of God in vain.   He spoke upon the subject of raising children spirits taking a tabernacle he said that every spirit was pure when it first entered the body, but many persons have been ruined in consequence of the  Mother giving way to temptation and fretfulness while in the state of child- bearing and the Husband ought to be vary tender and kind to the woman  while in that state and the Mothers mind ought to be excercised in page covered good things during the whole time and be calm and composed that what  ever temptation the mother should give way to would effect the Child  in after life. many other principles was spoken of by President Young of interest    ENDENTRY July 29, 1847 ~ Thursday   29th President Young with his brethren the Twelve and others mounted  our horses and started to meet with the Battalion under the command of  Captain Brown, we met with some of them about 4 miles from  camp we were truly glad to meet with them we continued on up  and soon met with Capts Brown, Willis and the train follo wing them we exhamined a good grind stone quiry while on the way page covered up I soon met with Br Bevin who went from my family into the  Army there was about 140 of the Battalion and a company of  about 100 of the Pueblo  being about 60 waggons in all 100 horses and Mules and 300 head of cattle   ENDENTRY which added greatly to our numbers we had a Heavy shower  of rain while we were in the canion which sent down the water  in the creeks from the mountain's with a rush and roar like thunder  resembling the opening of a flood gate the first rush of the water  came down with a front 3 feet high, some of the waggons had to stop untill it fell which was but a short time the shower spread  over a good share of the valley whare we were setled, we returned  with the company at there head and march into camp with music, they  took up there quarters between our two camps on the bank of  the creek. While we have been exploring the camp has been busy  in farming puting in potatoes, corn, beans, peas, buckwheat, and  preparing a garding for garding seeds and will go to work to prepare  a peace for turnips our garding to day was divided off as each ten  had need, our distance of travel to day was 12 miles   In the evening Br Young with the Twelve walked up to the warm  springs about 1 1/2 miles from the Temple Block we went in and bathed it was quite as warm as we could endure and be comfortable those  springs are healthy for the sick and diseased    ENDENTRY July 30, 1847 ~ Friday   30th FIGURE We met in council this morning with the Twelve and Captain  Willis and others and herd the statements of the  officers concerning the Battalion and there situation represented counsil was given by President Young to the Officers what course  to persue. It seemed wisdom for Capt Brown and others to go to the  Bay of San Francisco and report himself and men and the state they were  in Br Brannan would go as there Pilot much conversation took place during council of interest, Dr Sanderson was spoken of who  had been with the Battalion and it was believed he had tried to poison  the Brethren to death, and that he would be rewarded for his crimes After the Council broke up we mounted our horses and rode north to the warm springs also visited the hot sulpher spring 4 miles from  the Temple block it ishues out from under a rock a large fount ain of water forms a pool about 2 rods square 5 feet deep is  hot page torn enough to cook an egg in few moments we could hold our  fingers in it about 10 seconds.

He wished to come into my family also  Br James Bevin wished to returned again to my family as he  was with me when he went into the Army.   At 8 oclok All the camps met together and was addressed for more  than an hour by President Young in an interesting manner clothed  with the spirit of God. He expressed his feelyings freely concerning the  treatment of the government towards us in the same manner as he  did on the eve of the 28th. He informed the Brethren that there going  into the Armey proved our temporal salvation at the time for the Governor of Mo had already recieved orders not to let our  people pass the Mo river if we did not enlist, the goverment intend  to diestroy us from off the face of the earth but through the blessing  of God we are here and I thank my Heavenly father for it and  He knew we should prevail Zion would arise the Judgments of  God would be poured out the Blood of the Prophets would be avenged  and their cup would be filled double unto them. And if we were faith ful we should yet have Brs Hiram and many of the Saints  in there resurrected bodies with us on earth and when we died should   ENDENTRY not sleep but a little time but should come forth out of our graves page covered with bodies that no mob could kill. we were much edifyed with page covered all the remarks he made. the meeting opened with a shout of  Hosannah to God and the Lamb repeated three times with its Amen Br Young said the Ancient of days was not as far off as many  supposed.

I had not been on the bed but a short time before  Br Kimball called upon me and informed me that the Twelve  were going soon to the water to be baptized for the remission  of their sins to set an example to the Church as they would be  called upon on Sunday morning to bye baptized by the Twelve  for all those that wished, we considerd this a duty and privlege as we  come into a glorious valley to locate and build a temple and build up  Zion we felt like renewing our covenant before the Lord and  each other.   We soon repaired to the water and President Brigham Young went down into the water and baptized all his  Brethren the Twelve that were with him by burying them in the  water He also confirmed us in the Church and sealed upon us our  apostleship and all the keys, powers, and blessings belonging to that office Br Heber C.

In the afternoon we met again and pertook of  the sacrament Br Lorenzo Young addressed the people and was followed  by Br Brigham Young who was feeble in health, he gave good council  and we were edefyed, at the close of the meeting 110 men were called up  to go onto the Doby yard 70 volunteered and they thought that would  answer for a commencment. FIGURE   The following are some of the remarks made by w, woodruff in his address to the Saints in the fore part of the day written by Thomas  Bullock clerk. I have been much edifyed in the teaching given  by Elder, ^Kimball^ and have reflected much since I came into this valley, concer ning our situation, our calling, and the work that is required at our  hands. And the words of one of the Apostles will apply well to our  case "that when we have done the will of God we have need of  patience that we may obtain the blessing's and though it tarry long  we should obtain it if we continued faithful" Of all  people that ever lived we have the greatest reason to be faithful   ENDENTRY and exercise Patience and not be weary in well doing for we have  the greatest work to perform and blessings promised accordingly. The day has come when the Lord has set his hand with full pur- pose of heart to esstablish his Kingdom on the earth, gather Israel  build up Zion and Jerrusalem make an end of sin and cause all  nations to bow the Knee and every tongue to confess that Jesus is  the Lord and has a right to reign on the earth and ye are the  people ye Elders of Israel and Latter Day Saints that are moved  upon and called and chosen to do this work, who is sufficient for  these things, and what manner of persons ought ye to be. I rejoice  that I enjoy the society of so many of the Saints this day in this  glorious valley which has not been pelluted by the ungodly  gentiles and that I can speak with freedom without being trampled  by wicked men. the difference in the society tbetween the Saints  and the gentiles in the United States can ownly be contrasted betw- een Heaven and Hell in comparison for let an elder of this church  start from Saint Louis and let the people know  who he is and he would be in Hell all the time and there is a cause for  this a Prophet Seer and Revelater. Patriarchs and Apostles have been raised  up in there midst, the Church and kingdom of God has been planted  among them, the gospel preached and salvation freely offered unto all and  what have they done, they have stoned the Prophets and killed them poured out their blood like water upon the earth, have burned their  dwellings and given their goods to the flames, have driven the Apostles  with the keys of Eternal life and salvation with the entire Church  and kingdom of God out of their midst into the wilderness and the mountais  yets they have turned the last key that has sealed and locked fast their  condemnation that lingereth not and there damnation that slumber eth not. And this is the reason why they are full of hell and desire to  destroy every thing that retainets any portion of the spirit of the spirit  of God. But if it requires all the martered Saints in Heaven from  Righteous Abel to Joseph to go forth from the temple in Heaven  and pour out all the vials of the last plagues upon the United  States and open the seals upon them in order to avenge the blood  of the Prophets and Saints which they have spilt, it will be done  for that blood shall spedily be avenged. Yea vary spedily The Prophet Joseph, The Twelve Apostles,, with many of the  Elders of Israel and Saints have been called to pass through scenes  of sufferings and privations, that would have discouraged an Allexan der, they have had to combat earth and Hell, wicked men and devils,  sickness and death, burnings Drivings and persecutions, but have we ben discouraged no the greater the difficulties the  more we have been stimulated to action, what has sus tained us and inspired us to action in the midst of these  difficulties. We have been upheld by the power of God that  we might fulfill his purposes. Our spirits have been stired up by the  spilt blood of the Martered Prophets which still cries from the ground  to page covered heaven for vengance and will not rest neither let us untill it is avenged, we have also been moved upon by the spirits of our  fathers page covered and Progenitors whose bodies have lain in the dust for many  generatons, who recieved not the gospel in the flesh not having it proffered page covered unto them, but are now waiting for the redemption of their  bodies after salvation shall be sealed upon them through the instru mentality of their sons who should embrace the gospel in the fulness  of times, we are also moved upon by the Holy Ghost to accomplish the  great work of the last days and fulness of times in preparing the earth page torn   ENDENTRY for the reign of Christ, and to fulfill the promises which was made to the Ancient Prophets and Patriarch which promises they drew from  the Heavens by their faith and faithfulness before the Lord and saw the  work that lies before us by the spirit of inspiration revelation dreams  and the visions of Heaven. Thus it has been that a combination  of causes of eternal and important consequence has stimulated the Prophet  Apostles and Elders to action untill they have resolved in their hearts that  for Zions sake they would not hold their peace and for Jerrusalem sake  they would not rest, untill their righteousness goes forth as brightness  and Salvation as a Lamp that burneth. Yea the time has come for the  Lord to esstablish his kingdom on the earth and to make a short work of it and overthrow the Kingdom of the devel, for He has held dominion on the earth for many generations and in one instance undertook to  claim his right to all the Kingdoms of the world before the Lord when He showed the Savior all the kingdoms of the world and proffered to  give them to him if He would fall down and worship him, when in  fact the Poor Devil did did not own one foot of land on the earth I feel also that the time has come when we can no more preach salvation  to those of the gentiles who have rejected the Prophets and killed them and  cast the saints and the gospel out of their midst, the last time I was through the United States I could not preach salvation to the people  but I could have the spirit of God to preach damnation to them for they were worthy I tried to preach a gospel sermon in the Temple  in Nauvoo to many of the world who were present but it was hard  work to do it. But I could tell them about their spilling the  blood of the Prophets and the judgments that must follow them and that they had not got done with Joseph Smith but he would yet rule  in judgment against them and condemn them.

I thought if Joseph was justifyed in giving commandment to have his  bones taken to be buried in Canaan, that I was justifyed In taking my  living father and gathering him with the Saints and while at his house was visited by my Fathers Sister Aunt Wheeler who was naturly a  good woman and a strenuous Prysbeterian while conversing about our leaving  and going so far off she asked me with tears in her eyes if I supposed we could find any Christian society to associate with, I replyed for Gods sake and our sake I hope not, she gazed at me with amazement and wondered why I should feel so, I replyed that the Christians of  this generation in the United States had persecuted us to all intents and  purposes had burned our dwellings, given our goods to the flames  had murdered our Brethren, Sistiers, wives and children had martered  our Prophets, Patriarchs, and Apostles and driven the remainder of  us from their midst and should we now desire their society and seek  their religion? No I would rather be in the midst of the griselly bears of the rocky mountains, or mingle with the society of the Savages in the forest, than to longer mingle with such Christians or longer  bear the fruits of their religion    ENDENTRY August 9, 1847 ~ Monday   9th I spent the day in making a saw pit    ENDENTRY August 10, 1847 ~ Tuesday   10th I spent the day in preparing timber for our dwellings in the fort we decided by council to enclose one block of 10 acres with dobys and  buildings as a fort or fortification.

He then had not power to lay on hands to confirm  the Church but afterwards he recieved the Patriarchal or Melchisidick  Priesthood from under the hands of Peter James and John who were  of the Twelve Apostles and were the Presidency when the other Apostles were absent, from those Apostles Joseph Smith recieved every key FIGURE power, blessing, and Privilege of the highest authority of the Melchezedick  Priesthood ever committed to man on the earth which they held some have had fears that we had not power to get revelations since  the death of Joseph, but I want this subject from this time forth  to be forever set at rest and I want this Church to understand  from this day henceforth and forever that an apostle is the highest  office and authority that there is in the Church and kingdom of God  on the earth. from whom did Joseph recieve his authority from  just such men as sit around me here (pointing to the Twelve  Apostles that sat with him) Peter James and John were Apostles and  there was no noise about their being seers and Revelators though those  gifts were among them. Joseph Smith gave unto me and my brethren  the Twelve all the Priesthood keys Power and Authority which he had  And those are powers which belong to the Apostleship. In Josephs  day we had to ordain Patriarchs could we ordain men to Authority  greater than we held ourselves No. But it is necessary to have Patriarchs  to bless the People that they may have blessings by the spirit of prophecy  and Revelation sealed upon their heads and their posterity and know what  awaits their posterity Father Smith was the Seignor Patriarch in the  Church and first Patriarch in our day and afterwards Hiyram was the  seignor Patriarch for his father sealed it upon his head but was  there Power and Authority different from all Patriarchs in the  church No they were all alike in their authority in blessing. Elijah is spoken of in the Bible that he should come in the last days to sta  turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the children to their  fathers, the fulfillment of this scripture is manifest in esstablishing  the kingdom of God and Priesthood on the earth in the last days and those  who hold the keys of the priesthood and sealing power have the spirit and power of Elijah and it is necessary in order to redeem our dead and  save our children there is much more importance attached to this than  Parents are aware of. In the loss of this Crows that was  drowned I felt that I could weep in sorrow if I gave way to my feelings  for I realize it is a loss to the parents to loose little children. it is true all  children are saved there names are written in the Lambs book of life which was the case with every spirit that takes a tabernacle on  this earth. their names were written there before the world was  made, and will there ever remain untill they sin against the Holy Ghost  it will then be blotted out no more to be recorded forever. But not withstanding this can brother Crow get that child again or any other  person their children except their is sumthing done for them on the  earth by their Parents, No they would not, they would go to God who gave them but the parents on the earth would not have them, the  Parents framed the body to be sure but the Lord gave the spirit what is the body good for without the spirit. what then can be  done, I will tell you a man that has embraced the gospel must be  some one who has the Priesthood and keys and power of Elijah, and must  attend to ordinances for that child, even must be baptized for it as well as to have it sealed to him and through the 2 illegible words   ENDENTRY page torn Br Thirlkie    ENDENTRY August 12, 1847 ~ Thursday    page torn 12th Br ^grand^ child was buried today.

The following are some of the remarks made by President Young. I am  going to day sto speak upon the subject of the Patriarchal Priesthood and  by request of Br child that  was drowned the other day. I hope to speak so as to be understood There is a reality in eternal things as much as in the things of time  which we daily see with our eyes when a man has a dream or  vision of eternal things it is an evidence of its truth as much as  though he saw it with his own eyes in one sens of the word. The  Lord has hid from man the things that He knew before He  came in the flesh that he might walk by faith and prove himself  while here. The Lord converses with men on the earth in the  form of a servent and by visions and dreams andc but He never appears to  man in the flesh in the fulness of his glory, for He is as a  consuming fire and a mortal body would perish in an instant The Priesthood is again restored on the earth to bring back illegible which 2 illegible words we do not recieve all at once but 2 illegible words   ENDENTRY page torn claim child in the morning of the resurrection and the Lord  will give it up to him.

As soon as we get  up some doby houses for our families we shall go to work to  build another Temple and as soon as a place is prepared we shall  commence the Endowments long before the Temple is built and  we shall take time, and each step the Saints take let them take time  enough about it to understand it. evry thing at Nauvoo went with  a rush we had to build the Temple with the trowel in one hand and  the sword in the other and mobs were upon us all the while and  many crying out O the temple cant be built, I told them it should  be built, this Church should not fall and the Lord said if we did not build it we should be rejected as a Church with our dead why did  He say it because the Saints were becoming slothful and covetous and would  spend their means upon fine houses for themselves before they would  put it into a House for the Lord. But we went at it and finished  it and turned it over into the hands of the Lord in spite of earth and Hell  and the Brethren was so faithful at it that we laboured day and night to give  them their endowments. The Children want to be sealed to their Parents  and Parents to their Children, that they may have blessings in eternity that  they will stand in need of. God promised to Abraham that his seed should be as numerous as the stars of Heaven and the sands of the seashore and  to his seed there should be no end this of course would continue  through all Eternity, the same blessing is upon our heads if we are faith ful for our eyes have not seen, our ears herd neither entered into our  hearts the great things that God has in store for us. and when I look  upon the great work the Elders of Israel have to perform and look around upon them and see them vain and foolish, it makes me sorrowful they forget their Calling. O ye Elders of Israel think for a moment  what manner of persons ought ye to be, men who hold the priesthood  and keys of salvation and have power to go to the Nations of the Earth and  and say Here Gentleman and Ladies I have salvation for you and power to exhalt  you to Celestial Glory, or if you reject it to seal you unto damnation it is no trifling affair to have power put into your hand to deal with  the Eternal destinies of the sons and daughters of Adam that form  the Nations of the earth. While in the Temple at Nauvoo we voted  to cut off the gentiles who had rejected the gospel and killed the prophets and it was recorded on earth and if it is recorded in heaven that Nation will  go down quickly. Many other interesting and important items were presented  by President Young much to our edifycation. meeting was dismissed and  met again at 2 oclok and was addressed in a vary edifying manner  by O Pratt, and treated upon the same principles spoken off by Br  Young. Among his remarks he said, that as all the ordinances of the  gospel administered by the world since the Aposticy of the Church  was illegal, in like manner was the marriage cerimony illegal and all  the world who had been begotton through the illegal marriage, were  bastards and not sons and hence they had to enter into the law of adoption ink spot and be adopted into the Priesthood in order to become sons and legal heirs  of salvation.   Erastus Snow followed and spoke much to our edi fycation after which meeting was dismissed.
