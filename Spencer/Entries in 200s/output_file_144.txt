 standing my request of the previous evening, to leave me alone with the school in the forenoon, so that I could get a chance to see its every-day working. It is my custom every- where to address the students during last half hour or so in the afternoon, at which occasion the mem- bers of the Board and patrons of the school are welcome, but not before. According to all appearance, Bro. Miller is a faithful worker and will grow to be a valuable acquisition to our corps of teachers.  There were 45 students of the 5th & 4th Readergrade registered.  Sevier Stake  For this Stake I left Monday ^Tuesday^ Jan. 234, with the afternoon train, addressed that same evening a public meeting in Salina, and on the following evening one at Glenwood where I was joined by Pres. Seegmiller.Wednesday ^Thursday^, Jan 26,  left for Richfield, where I visited the Stake Academy for several hours, and met with the Academy Board. At the latter meeting, it was concluded to have the labors of the Academy Board separated from the Stake Board and steps to that effect were taken by the Stake Presidency. The Stake Academy is presided over by Bro. John Johnson, assisted by Sister Marinda Halliday, both teachers of a high order. 1500 students registered, among whom 17 Normals of the Junior Grade. 
 schoolhours, as the children are then too tired to take much interest, and especially many boys have to go home to do chores; neither could all the good be ac- complished on Saturdays for the same reasons as re- gards to the boys and many of the larger girls. It was, therefore, decided to apply to the School Trustee's to close the district schools one hour at least sooner  one day or two in the afternoon, for the purpose of letting our children have the privilege of going to their Religion-Classes. This plan has madeet with much favor everywhere, that it has been adopted thus far since, in St. George, Parowan, Beaver, Sevier, and Sanpete Stakes. The Stake Academy at St. George has had to suspend operation for this academic year, and Bro. Nephi Savage, the former Principal, has ac- cepted a position as teacher in the District schools, but has been appointed as Stake Superintendent of Religion- Classes. The same evening I filled an appointment in a meeting a Santa Clara. Saturday, Nov. 4, ad- dressed a conjoined meeting of the M. I. Association of St. George, visited the next morning the Sundayschools, and addressed the meeting of the Sundayschool teachers 
 There is a prospect that this Academy may succeed in serving a permanent Principal with the beginning of next school year, "a consummation devoutly to be wished" not only here but also in the other churchschools.  By appointment of Pres. Seegmiller, I filled appointments in the educational interest at Monroe, Elsinore, Richfield, and Joseph, during the time from Friday, Jan. 27 until Monday, Jan. 30, on which day I left for Beaver, where I had a preliminary meeting with the Stake Board andon  Tuesday, Jan. 31.  On Thursday, Feb 2nd met with the High Council of Beaver Stake at which occassion a "Stake Board of Education" was appointed, as the Academy Board has incorporated under the laws of the territory, and its members are under bonds.  Parowan Stake.  Friday, Febr. 3rd I left for Parowan, where I had to stay until Tuesday, Febr 7 in the morning when I left for Cedar City.  During my stay at Parowan I met with the Local Board of the Sem- inary, addressed the Sunday School on Sunday morning, and public meeting in the evening and one in the after noon. Monday, Febr 6, attended the Parowan Seminary, Bro. Jos. A. Sill, Principal, but no Assistant.  Bro. Sill is an energetic young man, very much desirous of improving 
 at noon; and a public meeting in the Tabernacle in the afternoon, after which we took our de- parture from St. George, having been appointed for an evening meeting at Washington that mee- ting there was crowded and I noticed with much satisfaction the presence and close attention of the younger portion of that community. Monday, Nov. 6, addressed a large meeting in the evening at Toquer- ville As there are several young people from this and other places in St. George Stake attending.  The Normal Course for Sunday School and M. I. Asso- ciation Work at the Brigham Young Academy, at Provo, A vast improvement in these institutions thoughout the Stake is looked forward to after the return of these Normals.  I am sorry to state however, that one of them, Bro. Jedediah Larson of St. George, died at Provo last week, of pneumonia. Tuesday, Nov. 7 we arrived in the afternoon at Kannarah, and I addressed as per appointment, a large meeting there in the evening. It would be ridiculous if it were not too sad, to notice the restraint ^under^ which the young men felt themselves obliged to ^be^ in that place, to behave themselves at least sufficiently during the meeting, in order not to become absolutely offensive.  "You see, Bro. Maeser," so said the Bishop to me," Stockraising is capacitated to never to be seen in decent society." 
 improving himself in his profession but being unfamil- iar with our educational system, has had a great many difficulties to content with at first, from which he has extricated himself very creditably in a great measure. There seem to be many evil influences bearing upon the young people all through Parowan Stake, which is to be accounted for to some extent by the dairy- business which takes the young people into the mountains a great portion of the year, during which time they seem to be left without guidance or restraint.  Our teachers have a hard time of it in such neighborhoods.  Parowan Stake Academy, at Cedar. I left Parowan, for Cedar, Tuesday, Febr. 7 in the morning and addressed a large congregation at the Tabernacle in the morning. Next day, Febr. 8 attended the Stake Academy, Bro. Homer McCarty, Principal, with Miss Mary Middleton, Assistant.  Bro. McCarty is a very efficient teacher, of a College training, and a splendid disciplinarian. I have  some misgivings as to his spiritual standing as he is the offspring of an apostate family, but have been most agreeably disappointed.  Bro. McCarty has had the difficult problem to solve, to build up a school that had been going down to the very verger of 
 Wednesday, Nov. 8, we returned to Parowan, where the same evening a meeting of the Seminary Board was held, at which  the devotion of the members under the wise leadership of Bp. Charles Adams, manifested itself very markedly. The Seminary had opened five weeks before under the Principalship of Bro. Frank Cutler, who has accepted the position under the conditions of the usual pro rata plan, and has gained already within that short time the confidence of the community and of his pupils, so that the attendance at his Seminary is daily increas- ing. His records are in first class order, and his plans, programs, methods, and general progress of his work very satisfactory, so that he expects to have an assistant before long His students comprise the 6, 7, & 8th grades. Much credit is due to the Seminary Board for fitting up and furnishing the Seminary rooms in such a handsome and suitable manner.  A reception to endorse me by the Authorities and People of Parowan in the evening, I accepted only in my capacity as a representative of the General Board of Education in whose name I thanked and congratulated them for their appreciation of the aims of that honorable body, and expressing the hope that 
 dissolution and accomplished it to his credit.  Some minor details in method in order to harmonize his labors more with those of our other churchschools belong to our mutual correspondence.  There are about 120 students re- gistered.  After the close of the Academy exercises, a Board- meeting was held, at which it was concluded to organize a Stake Board of Education, in order to avoid in future that deplorable condition of "Local Jealousy" that in so many instances already has obstracted the best interest of our  educational organization.  St. George Stake.  Thursday, Febr. 9, started for St. George, via Leeds, and arrived at my destination Friday, the 10th at 4 P.M. After having attended during Saturday a meeting of the High Council of the Stake in the forenoon, and a funeral in the afternoon, I spend the morning in consultation with Pres. McArthur and Principal Nephi Savage about the Stake Academy affairs. Sunday, Febr. 12th found me addressing the Sundayschool in the morning, a public meeting in the afternoon, a Wardmeeting in the evening, and by special invitation a meeting of the District School Teachers after the Wardmeeting.  Monday, Febr. 12, was 
 a turn in the financial affairs of our people would enable the General Authorities of the Church to ren- der such assistance to our struggling churchschools, as they so much desired to be able to. Being met at Bughorn Springs by Bro. Shepherd, of Beaver, I ar- rived at the latter place, Friday, Nov. 10.  Beaver Stake  The Stake Academy building at Beaver is now under roof and is presenting an imposing appearance from the outside.  It consists of two stories, containing an entrance with room for a flight of stairs and a small office, two classrooms down stairs, and a large assemblyroom upstairs with a landing outside. Bro. Shepherd has charge of the building work and expects to get it all finished before spring.  Saturday, Nov. 11, I attended a meeting of the Primaries conjoined, and a meeting of the Religion-Classes. Reinhard Maeser, being Stake Superintendent of the latter. There was a meeting of the Stake and of the Local Board of Education held at the Tithingoffice that evening, at which the earnestness of the members in their endeavor to make their church school system a success was demonstrated beyond a doubt. Sunday, Nov. 12. visited in com- pany with Pres. White and my son Reinhard, the Sundayschool Superintendent, the three Sunday- schools of Beaver, and addressed a Sunday School 
 in the Stake Academy, where Bro. Savage is assisted by Bro. Charles H. Miles. It is a pity that such excellent work has to be done under such unfavorable almost unwholesome conditions. Bro. Savage deserves special commendation for his devotion to our Church School Organization and his Stake Academy in particular. He has labored now five years in that position in St. George under sometimes very discouraging cir- cumstances.  In appreciation of his devoted labors, the members of the Board have secured him now a desirable home upon their own personal soverinty. The following day a meeting of the Stake Board was held, at which it became apparent, that there was no need for the present for organizing a separate Stake Board.  During that day, I also visited the District Schools, and paid my respects to Pres. McAllister and the other brothern at the Temple, spending several hours with them with much profit to myself. In the evening went with Pres. McArthur to Santa Clara and addressed a large meeting there, returning to St. George the same night.  Wednesday, Febr. 15, went with Pres. McArthur to Leeds, where we held a large meeting in the evening. Thursday, Febr. 16, I parted with Pres. McArthur, starting for Kanarah, where the same evening a large mee- ting was held the next day I started for Beaver, via 
 Teachers meeting at noon on the subject of the "Guide" and the Sunday School Normal Course, at Provo, as this Stake has as yet no representative at the Normal Course. Addresses in the afternoon meeting and ^at^ the conjoined M. I. Associations in the evening, concluded my labors in Beaver Stake, and I started the following morning via Cove Creek to  Sevier Stake.  Arrived at Joseph City in the evening of Monday, Nov. 13, and addressed there a large meeting on the usual topics, leaving the next morning for Monroe, where a meeting was held at 1 P. M. The district schools adjourned for the session and filed into the meetinghouse under the leader- ship of their respective teachers, one of whom a gentile lady, and occupying reserved seats.  The Methodminister came on the stand after the meeting and thanked me in behalf of himself and the children for my instruc- tions on "Reverence."  That same evening I addressed a crowded meeting at Elsinore. It is very gratifying to me to notice in all the places mentioned in this report, that former students of the Brigham Young Academy, are honoring their former training 
 via Cedar City, Iron County, Utah Territory|Cedar and Parowan, and arrived at Beaver, Saturday, Febr. 18, in the afternoon.  Sunday, Febr. 19, as usual I had to address the Sundayschool, and after that a meeting of the Sundayschool teachers, in the afternoon a public meeting, and in the evening a Conjoined meeting of the M. I. A. Tuesday, Febr. 21, started with Pres. C. White for Minersville, where I addressed a public meeting in the morning in the interest of the rising generation.  Panguitch and Millard Stake  As I have not visited either of these stakes althoug belonging to this circuit,  it is my duty to state here the reason for this omission.  After some fruitless endeavors to secure a Prin- cipal for Panguitch Stake Academy, I succeeded in obtain- ing a candidate for the position upon the recommenda- tion of Prof. W. Done, endorsed by Dr. Talmage. The person, however, did not suit Pres. Crosby and was dismissed by him after 5 weeks labor.  Thus was brought the acad. year for that Academy to a sudden end. There is a L. D. S. Seminary, at Escalante, of the same stake, in a flourishing condition, and a petition from that Local Board, en- dorsed by Pres. Crosby in behalf of the Stake Board is herewith enclosed. The Principal of that Seminary, is a 
 and taking an active part in the spiritual work of their respective communities.  There are a few exceptions and they'r in every instance, are avoiding to meet me. During all my labors in Sevier Stake I had the privilege of enjoying the company of Bro. Clark, counselor to Pres. Seegmiller in whose absence the former took me around the Stake. We arrived at Richfield, Wednesday, Nov. 15. in the forenoon, the remainder of which I spent in the Stake Academy. Bro. Allen R. Cutler, Principal, and Mrs. Merinda Halliday, Assistant.  They la[bor] like all the rest of churchschool teachers as volunteers under the pro rata plan, and are keeping a most excellent school. Records, organisation, work, pro- gress, and spirit, are everything that can be desired, and are duly appreciated by the Au- thorities and the people. Here as in all other schools which I am visiting, I addressed the pupils, and visitors, during the last hour before closing in the afternoon on some essential edu- cational points. By special request I delivered a public lecture in the evening and turns of as  ^after having^ met with the Stake Board in the Tithing office after school on the subject of Religion-Classes. Bro. Allen R. Cutler was appointed Stake Superintendent. My labors in Sevier Stake concluded with meetings at Glenwood, Vermillion, Redmond, and Salina, 
 Bro. Lewis J. Bushman, who seems to have obtained the cordial support of the people at Escalante. In regard to the Millard Stake Academy I have to report, that my appointment for that school had been duly forwarded to Pres. I. N. Hinckley, but receiving no answers I happened to inquire at Sevier from a citizen of that ^Millard^ County, what the matter was with Fillmore. I was informed that that Academy had broken up at Christmas, and that Alma Greenwood, the Principal, had got off the track in bad shape, and that the M. I. Associations of the whole Stake had likewise gone down. Thereupon I canceled my appointment for Millard Stake in a letter to Pres. Hinckley, to which, however, I have no answer either. As Alma Greenwood has applied to me for his Certificate as a Church School Teacher, I respectfully ask for instructions, what to do in the matter.  Juab Stake Academy  I arrived at Nephi, Thursday, Febr. 23rd with the noon train from Milford, and attended the Stake Academy the day following Principal Justin Call is a rising young teacher of splendid qualifications, willing to be taught, and very earnest in his work. Being placed in a position entirely new to him, he has done remarkably well for a beginner, and as he intends to take a

Gunnison Seminary  Bp. Madsen, of Gunnison, having met me at Salina in  the evening of Friday, Nov. 17, took me to Gunnison the next morning. But before arriving at Gunnison proper, I had to meet unexpectedly the Sundayschool children with their teacher at the "Gunnison Field" at 11 A. M. and address them, after which we were received at 2:30 P.M. at Gunnison by the students of the Seminary with their teachers, which also necessitated an address to them at the Seminary, which meeting was attended by many parents. There had also been announced a lecture for the evening which duty I performed also to the best of my ability, but I confessed after that I was somewhat tired for once.  Sunday was spent in visiting and addressing the Sunday school, likewise a meeting in the afternoon, and a meeting of the Sunday

Miss Mattie Nelson, his very efficient lady-teacher, is unfortunately at this time seriously ill, and her department, in charge of a makeshift substitute, is suffering accordingly.  After having met with the Stake Board of Education, I inten- ded to leave for home, Saturday Nov. 25, but Pres. W. Paxman insisted upon me staying at Nephi over Sunday.  During that day my time was filled up as always by addressing the Sunday school in the forenoon, and the public meeting in the afternoon, and a Wardmeeting in the evening.  Monday, Febr. 27, I spent the forenoon at the Academy, assisting the Principal in introducing the Monitorial System, myself acting for the time being as Monitor.

He has all grades from the 1st to the 8th grade.  The school  is well conducted, records in good shape, and spirit ex- cellent. It was the beginning of a new term, and they concluded at the Boardmeeting in the afternoon to engage at once an assistant teacher.  Sevier Stake Academy.  The following day I left for Ephraim. On my arrival, Pres. Peterson requested me to prolong my stay until Satur- day, Nov. 25, as that would be the only day at which all the Religion-Instructors of the Stake could meet and this I consented to do, and my time until then was filled out with visiting the Stake Academy, Principal and Teachers of last year continuing, mee- ting with the Stake Board, giving a lecture to the conjoined meeting of the M. I. Associations, re- ceiving a reception one evening similar to the one at Parowan, and finally meeting with the Religion-Class Instructors of the Stake, Sunday school Instructors, M. I. Associations Officers included.  There was a large meeting that Saturday, at 10 A. M. The Religion-Classes of Sanpete Stake have thus far taken the lead in this matter throughout Zion. This closed my circuit lasting just 5 weeks to a day.  Respectfully, Karl G. Maeser 
 Elder W. Woodruff addressed the congrega- tion. Said the principles of the gospel are plain and easy of comprehension. At the same time no  man can see the kingdom of God unless he is born of the Spirit. Our enemies have always  failed to accomplish their designs and they al- ways will. The means by which they have been  defeated are always so simple that they can not comprehend them. Alluded to the signal triumphs of this people in the last six months. The U. S.  government have tried to grapple with Polygamy but they have been foiled, because it is of God. Dedicate your homes to God, and the devil can have no power there. On the subject of tithing said the man who withholds his just tithes robs God. No man can prosper and get rich by taking such a course. On the contrary God more abund- antly blesses those who tithe their property. Celes tial marriage is the only order by which we can receive any blessings behind the vail. Treat not this sacred subject lightly. 
 Provo, August 10, 1895. President Wilford Woodruff, Dear Brother,  Out of the forty churchschools that hadve been organised  since the establishment of our Churchschool System  only fifteen have been in operation during the last  schoolyear.  The reasons of the closing down of so many  churchschools have been twofold.  the first is the finan-  cial inability of the Boards of Education to continue  their schools without some appropriation either from  the people or from the General Board, and the  second is the inability of the teachers to continue  their labors any longer at the pro rata plan, as the inducements to enter the districtschool service  for better salaries became too strong for some. Although several were holding on as long their  circumstances would allow, and a few are  yet faithful to us at the same rate. The schools in operation during last year are as  follows:  1. [Brigham Young Academy, Provo, Utah County, Utah Territory|Brigham Young at academy, Provo, Prof. B. Cluff. 38 weeks.  2. Brigham Young College. Logan. Prof. W. J. Kerr. 38 weeks.  3.  L. D. S.

J. Spori. 3 terms 
 11. Cassia S. Academy.  Oakley.  Geo. Day. 2 Terms.  12. Marisopa S. Ac.  Mesa City.  G. W. Lewis. 3 Terms.  13.  St. Joseph. S. Ac.  Thatcher.  Geo. Cluff.  2 Terms.  14.  Diaz Academy.  Diaz.  Wm. M. Daines.  3 Terms. 15.  Juarez Academy.  Juarez.  D. E. Harris.  3 Terms.  In addition to them I have to report that the Local Board of Huntington Seminary is desirous of re- opening their Seminary the coming season.  No there  is no prospect that the Stake Board of Emery  ever will do anything in the matter of Educa- tion, and the Local Board at Huntington  is manifesting much interest and energy, I  should suggest, that the latter ^should) be accepted  as the Stake Academy.  Diplomas. Diplomas.   Upon the recomendation of the  Board of Examiners, the General of  Education has issued Diplomas to following persons in the years of 1893 and 1894: Milton H. Hardy. Dr. & BD [illegible]al Science Joshua H. Paul.  B.D. [illegible]isure. Joseph B. Keeler B Pre[illegible]  George H. Brimhall [ illegible]  Wm. J. Kerr.

 Salt Lake City, Febr 10, [189]7.  President Wilford Woodruff. Chairman Gen. Board of Education.  Dear Brother,  Since my last report of October 10, 1896 I have visited the  Brigham Young Academy, Provo; the Latterday Saints College; Salt Lake City, Brigham Young College, Logan; the Weber  Stake Academy, Ogden; S and Sanpete Stake Acadeny, at Ephraim besides held meetings with Religion Classexercises in many  Wards of Sanpete and Cache Stakes.  It is my pleasant duty  to report a reawakening of the interest in our educational  systems both in regard to Churchschools and Religion Classes not only in the two Stakes named but also in a great  many other Stakes.  This statement is based partly upon  my own personal observation and partly upon my extensive and continuous correspondence.  And these colleges are doing very satisfactory professional  work.  The Brigham Young Academy at Provo is a model institution especially in the socalled Training school. since this division of the Academy is occupying its new  quarters. I suggest, however, that the ^draft for the^ new plan and Circular  for the next schoolyear be submitted first to a Committee of the of the Local Board for review & approval 
 Highschools. In addition to the already existing  three Colleges, that should represent the climax  of our educational organization, I should re= spectfully suggest the establishment of same, Highschools with the necessary three years' course, on a plan similar to the one published as  suggested thus far by the Territorial Teachers' Convention of Oct. 6, 1894, with such modifications  as the General Board may deem proper to make. I suggest that the Stake Academi'es at Ogden, Pres- ton, and Ephraim be enabled to organized in  that way.  Board of Examiners. The appointment of Dr. Talmage  as President of the University of Utah makes his con- tinuance as a member of the Board of Examin- ers inexpedient in several respects, and if the  General Board should decide that dby this  appointment of Dr. Talmage a vacancy in the  Board of Examiners had occurred, I should  suggest that Dr. J. M. Tanner, a former mem= ber of said Board, be reinstated.  Appropriations. Realizing fully the conditions that have made appropriations  for our churchschools  well nigh impossible for the last year or two,  I approach this subject with great reluctance. But knowing the vast influence for good amoung  our rising generation that has been accom= plished thus far already by our church= schools, I feel it my duty, to present to the Gen= eral Board the necessity for some steps by 
 The Brigham Young College in Logan is doing excellent work as far as it is able to, being subject to great inconve- niences in regard to no recommendation.  Since the  partial adoption after my repeated urging, of the  theological, domestic, and moniterial systems, this  College is now in l completely in line with the spirit and mind of the General Board.  This statement refers merely to the faculty as I had no opportunity to meet with that Local Board.  The Latterday Saints' College  is doing as good work as far as its present plan [objecties], the incovenient accomodations, and the uncer- tainty in regard to its future condition will permit. There are three Stake Academies that henceforth should be definitely reorgnized as Highschools and have their charters changed accordingly.  This step is appropriate  on account of the work done by them and the in- fluence they are exercising. These Academies are the  Stake Academies at Ephraim, Preston; and Ogden. The Stake Academies at Vernal, Paris, Oakley, Rexburg, and Diaz are doing very satisfactory Intermediate and Primary Grade work, while the Academies at  Juarez and Mesa City are still laboring under make shift arrangements.  The Seminary at Huntington has had  a very satisfactory run for two terms this schoolyear. This makes 14 churchschools in operation at present.  Bro. Geo. Reynolds and myself were appointed at  the October meeting of the Gen. Board a Committee to reviw Gen. Circ. Nos. 7 & 8 in accordance with the  requirements of the advanced conditions of our  Church School Organization.  In [commencing] our  labors for this purpose we soon discovered that 
 Salt Lake City, Oct. 10. [189]6.  President Wilford Woodruff. Dear Brother,  I herewith submit to you and the General Board of Education the statistical report of our churchschools for  the academic year 1895 1896, ending June 30th last. A financial report could not be made out as not all  schools have reported their financial condition, and  some gave only approximate statements.  A general review of our churchschools based partly upon my personal observations and partly upon re- ports from the respective Boards and faculties has  given the following results for the past schoolyear:  I. Schools.  There have been in operation: 3 Colleges, 12 Stake  Academies, and 1 Seminary,. They were distributed 2 3 in Idaho, 9 in Utah, 2 in Arizona, and 2 in Mexico.  II Teachers.  There have been 86 teachers laboring in our church- schools during the past year, ^of^ whom 8 hold academic  diplomas, 18 intermediate certificates, 55 annual li- censes, and 5 special licenses. 
 by  which ^not only^ the closing down of some more of our  churchschools can ^may^ be averted, but also the reo- pening of those now closed facilitated, and the  establishment of new ones encouraged.  Permanency of Teachers' engagements. It is very  gratifying to me to report that my endeavors  to convince Boards of Education of the great ben- efits of permanent engagement of faithful and efficient teachers, have been effectual in  several instances, in as much as the Principals  of our churchschools in Provo, Logan, Salt Lake, Ogden, Preston, and Emphraim, and some of  leading teachers have been laboring in their  respective positions for several years, and are  not desirous of any change.  To encourage this  beneficant condition, I should suggest the  plan, that at some furture time a portion of  the annual appropriation made by the General  Board for our churchschools be set apart  as a premium for such teachers of ours, as have remained five years in our service. This premium might be correspondingly increased at every fifth year afterwards, until a certain worthiness for the respective  teacher's grade be reached.  Circular No. 9 and Letterheads.  The Board of  Examiners have revised Circulars No. 7 & 8,  as instructed by the General Boards, and the  manuscript can be made ready for print  as Circular No. 9, whenever the General 
 more interpolations and incidental changes in the existing  copies of Circulars Nos. 7 & 8 would prove entirely insufficient  especially in regard to the requirements for examination of  teachers for the various grades, and to the outlines of studies. There will have to be interpolated a whole course of studies  for the Highschool Grade, and the Collegiate courses  have also to be greatly revised.  I suggest respectfully that these alterations be furnished every churchschool in a typewritten copy and published for general  information in the Church School Papers as fast as  they are required.  The Board of Examiners have held several meetings and have a large lot of applicants for examination in the several grades before them.  They propose to  hold in future one examination for all such applic- ants.  This examination to be held shortly after the  schools have closed that is at the latter part of June. I should suggest also the holding of a Church School  Con[v]ocation during one week at the same time with  the examinations, place, time, and details to be  determined by Committees appointed by the Gen. Board.  Since the publication of the "Outlines for Religion Class 
 III Studies.  there have been 54 different branches taught in 643 classes. Some of the latter recited 5 times a week, some 3  times, and some twice.  IV Students.  The total number of students reported as having at- tended our churchschools during the year is 3112, of  whom 1825 are males, and 1287 females. They were re- gistered as 447 Primary Dept; 443 Preparatory; 1016 Inter- mediate; 76 Commercial; 428 Academic; 672 Normal; leaving 20 unaccounted for.  V Board of Examiners.  In consequence of the appointment of Bro. J. M. Tanner as President of the Agricultural College, his [illegible] [illegible] by the General Board of Examiners becomes inconsis- tent and conflicting, in as much as he is now exofficio a member of the Stake Board of Examiners, and the vacancy thus occasioned should be filled by some  one else.  The Board of Examiners held four regular meetings  during the first year, and its members have been en- gaged in examining canidates for diplomas and  certificates, some of these examinations are still  pending.  Following points from the minutes of the last mee- ting of the Board of Examiners are herewith respect- fully submitted for the consideration of the  General Board of Education:  1. Bro. Wm J. Kerr moved the recommendation  to the General Board that in cases where persons 
 Board should desire to order its publication. In consequence of my extensive correspondence, my supply of large letterheads has been exhaus- ted for a long time, as also are the blanks for  Statistical Reports. Both items are of some  importance in the transaction of our running  business, and I would respectfully ask for  a new supply.  Uintah Stake Academy,  at Vernal, will reopen  again this fall, after having been closed for one  year. The Board there have erected an addition  to their original Academybuilding, consisting  of a large classroom and a Principal's office. Their  indebtedness amounted in all $695 00, which  since last Sunday, they expect to cancel  within a week or two by private donation. The people of Uintah Stake are very enthusiastic  for their Academy.  Religious Classes. It gives me great pleasure to  report the Stakes of Utah, Sanpete, Tooele, Beaver,  and Box Elder, as energetic and faithful in the maintenence of the Religion Class move- ment, although even there many obstacles,  consisting chiefly in the indifference of the  authorities toward it, have to be overcome.

 Work, a copy of which accompanied by a Circular letter  of Dec. 15, was sent to every Stake Presidency in Zion, the  Religion Class movement has taken a fresh start. Of the 37 Stakes 18 have answered in the affirmation and  I am in communication with their respective Stake  Superintendents of Religion Classes, answering questions, sending and recording Licenses for Instanctors, and  sending copies of "Outlines."  10 of these 37 Stakes have re- ported that they could not see their way clear for the present to introduce these Religion Classes, and 9 have  not answered at all as yet.  As it will be necessary for me to visit all those  Stakes in the first place that have responded to  the call for introducing Religion Classes, in order  to demonstate by classexercises and explainatory ad- dresses the nature of these classes, and also to urge  upon the people the necessity of sustaining our  churchschools the traveling expenses begin to be  a point of serious consideration.  My district of labors  extends from Alberta to Juarez Stake, and I have traveled all that distance thus far at the expense of the  Deseret Sunday School Union as I combined my labors  in that organization with those of the Church School interest.  But these Religion Classes require my visits at times when I cannot combine them with the Sun- day School work.  I submit, therefore, your instructions in  this matter.

 Provo, May 11, 1895.  President Wilford Woodruff.  Dear Brother, The first Presidency being too busy last Thurs- day to hear my report and to give me some  much needed instructions in regard to our  churchschool affairs, I feel it Amy duty to ad- dress you in writing on some of the most  pressing subjects that need immediate at- tention.  1. Referring to Pres. Cannon's instruction to  me in regard to Dr. Talmage's retirement from  the Board of Examiners, I report, that I  had an interview with Bro. Talmage on  the subject. He stated to me that he had of- fered his resignation from the membership in that Board to the First Presidency but  that it had not been accepted,. He would  prefer now to remain until the question  of the conferring of degrees and diplomas  by any of the churchschools would have  been settled definitely in accordance  with the decision of the General Board  of Education. He understood that Prof.  Cluff was determined to issue degrees  [an]d diplomas this coming commence- ment to his graduates in spite of the  General Board 
 schools, I have endeavored to unite my visits to  them as much as possible with my travels in  the Sundayschool interest, and have met with  Boards of Education and Localties, held  public meetings on the subject wherever a chance presented itself. Besides this a very  extensive correspondence has been carried  on constantly, so as to enable me to keep track of the conditions of Boards and Schools. I find that some Stakes have thus far paid  no regard at all to the Circular of the General  Board of Education, of June 8, 1888, as far  as the organization of a Stake Board is concerned, and others that have organized once, have  suffered ^it^ to drop out of sight again. If all the  General Conference next October, or in some other way the First Presidency would urge upon their Stake Authorities the impor- tance of this move, it would prove a great stimulus to our works.  With kind regards,  Karl G. Maeser Gen. Supt 
 2. In order to ascertain the truth of Bro Talmage's  statement I had an interview with Bro. Cluff  last night at his office and obtained from  him following answer: He had just  returned from an audience with the  First Presidency, who had approved of his  propositions. What those propositions  had been, Bro. Cluff did not inform  me. In regard to the bestowal of de- grees and diplomas he was resolved  to bestow them as he had done for  the last three years. When I reminded  him of the discussion on the sub- ject in the last meeting of the General  Board and the decision arrived at then, and that I would furnish him an  extract on that point from the minutes,  I said that he did not care for those  minutes, and that nothing but a  written injunction from the First Presi- dency could stop him.  3.

 Provo City, Decemb. 13, [189]4.  President Wilford Woodruff.  Dear Brother;  Bro. Geo. Reynolds has submitted to  me Dr. J. E. Talmage's letter of Nov. 17,  addressed to you, containing his request for your permission to have the sug- estive outline for a "Course of Study for  the High Schools of Utah Territory" dis- tributed among our churchschools for  the purpose of obtaining suggestions from  our teachers. He also proposes to have  this course after its final adoption by  the Legislature followed by our church  schools for the sake of harmonious  education in the secular branches.  I have had this matter under con- sideration for some time, have stu- died the "Outline" over very carefully

Bro. Cluff informed me also that he had  engaged with the full approval of the  First Presidency, Geo. Phillips of Ogden as  Professor. Having been under the painful necessity of investigating that man Phillip's  conduct in Bear Lake, Ogden, and Provo, while he was in the churchschool service, and having found him entirely unworthy to be an instructor of our youth, I most  emphatically protested against such an  engagement. Bro. Cluff told me, that  Phillips had been rebaptised and so forth. Knowing the character of absolute unrelia- bility of that man, that state of his does  not go far with me, although I shall  give him the benefit of my best wishes  and hopes for his reformation. I do  not think it is wisdom to place that  man, so soon after his repentance, as an instructor in the leading church 
 Provo City, Sept. 15, 4. President Wilford Woodruff.  Dear Brother,  On my returning from my California Mission  last month, I found the statistical reports from  many of our churchschools still missing not withstanding the repeated reminders that have  been sent into all directions. There are still a few  lacking making it impossible for me to submit  to the General Board of Education a complete  summary of our Church School Organisations  for the academic year 1893-1894. I have wit ten, however, to the few dilatory was urgent  letter requesting them to send in their report without fail before the 19th inst. in order to  unable us to get up the complete summary  one week before October Conference.

 once in three months for the purpose of deliberating in regard to the best means for advancing the edu- cational interests in their respective Stakes, in too many instances this rule has been entirely neglec- ted, and some of them have not met once during the whole year.  In consequence of which neglect, several churchschools have closed down that could have been saved with comparatively little effort and the Religion-Classes received no attention  at all.  Teachers.  Not too much can be said in praise of many of  our churchshoolteachers, who have carried their respective schools during the last two years not only at their own financial risks at great sacrifice, but also in some instances without any encourag- ing word on the part of their respective Boards. We are losing this year a majority of our best intermediate teachers that have to [enter] the District School Service, not being able to hold out any longer without the necessary financial and moral support.  Revision of Gen. Circ. Nos. 7 & 8.  The discontinuance of the Church University and the changes in our Churchschool Organisation, as set forth in the "Official Announcement" of Aug. 18, last, are making changes in Gen. Circ. Nos. 7 & 8 indispensable, in as much as in the administration of our affairs constant reference to there guides has to be made.  
 and will have to suggest some alter- ations as far as our Stake Academies  are concerned. I have also sent  copies to several of our prominent principals and teachers with  the request to let me have their views on the subject.  Thus far I am prepared to state, that a somewhat similar plan will have to be followed by our  Stake Academies in the future or  else we should be left behind  and the secular "Highschools"  would absorb our more ad- vanced students. The consequence of this would be a retrogradation  of our schools to the level of dis- trictschools. Instead of branches  proposed on that "Outline", that  are not essential in our eyes, I should  recommend branches in Technics (or Manual Labor) for both sexes, and  instructions in Agriculture and Horti- culture.

Cannon some years ago in regard to the character  of the persons whose names I should  submit to Pres. Woodruff for his approval  as churchschool teachers.  5. A meeting of the General Board of Edu- cation at an early date would be most  desirable, as the condition of our Stake  Academies requires some steps to be taken  in order to place them upon as per- manent basis and raise them to the  Highschool standard, without which  our whole educational system would  be swamped by the new order of things  at the approaching statehood.

In consequence of the closing down of so many of our churchschools it becomes more necessary than ever that the great movement of the estab- lishment of Religion-Classes in every Stake of Zion, as recommanded by the First Presidency in a circular letter, dated Oct. 29th, 1890, should receive a renewed and energetic impotus.  The arrangement of making these classes auxiliary to the Sundayschools, has proved very successful in several Stakes.

 Provo, May 20,    5.  President Wilford Woodruff.  Dear Brother,  At an interview with Prof. B. Cluff at his office this afternoon, I learned that the normal Graduates of the Brigham Young Academy for this year have all been working hard at their very trying examinations in expectation of their diplomas conferring upon them the degree of Bachelor of Pedagogy.  As in consequence of your injuction to the Principal there degrees could not be conferred, but only a very serious dis- appointment would ensure to the  poor young ladies and gentleman, but would also demonstrate a con- flict between the General Authorities and the Faculty of this Academy, which could prove very detrimental to the institution, therefore!  I suggest to Prof. Cluff a com-

Dear Brother,  During my last circuit through the Stakes in Mexico,  Arizona, and Colorado, that the Saints were desirous more  than ever for the advantages of one church school edu- cation. In consequence, therefore, the Juarez Stake  Academy takes the lead among the four churchschools  in Mexico, namely at Diaz, Dublan, and Pacheco. The  Juarez Academy will soon be ready to occupy the new and commodious premises provided for here by the  energy and devotion of the authorities and people  of that flourishing community. All the teachers of these  schools are duly authorized by the General Board, either  by diploma or license, those of the latter class will  pass their examinations for standing certificates  during the summervation before Profs. Geog C. Wilson  and Charles R. Fillerup, who have been appointed  under certain regulations as deputies of the Board of  Examiners. I have also appointed Prof. Wilson as In- spector of the Juarez District of Churchschools, so that 
 promice to the effect, that the First Presidency authorize Apostle Brigham Young in writing to con- fer these degrees in the name of the General Board of Education next Thursday morning accor- ding to the already published program.  I think the would be the best way out of the dilemma for the  present occasion, as before another examination shall arrive, the General Board will have their question of degrees in our curch- schools settled definitely.  With kind regards Your brother in the Gospel, Karl G. Maeser  P.S. Prof. Cluff sustains my suggestion. K. G. M. 
 17 1/2 Oak Str. San Francisco, July 27. [189]4.  President Wilford Woodruff.  Dear Brother,  Having been set apart for my mission to California, at the Historian's Office, Friday, January 20th last, I started, accompanied by my daughter Ottilie, for my destination, Monday, January 23, and arrived at San Francisco, Wed- nesday, January 25. Elders John L. Dalton and Ezekiel L. Blo- gett recieved us at the landing with whom I shortly after proceeded to the Midwinter Fair Grounds to present my letter of introduction to Mr. Badlam, Secretary of the Executive Committee. It gives me much pleasure to report to you the uniform kindness with which Mr. Badlam has trus ted me in consequence of which all preliminary arrange- ments for our educational exhibit was greatly facilita- ted.  The Exhibit.  A place ^space, 15 x 17 ft^ on the North Gallery of the Liberal Art-Buil- ding, had been assigned us, by th and we proceeded at once to dedicate that place in a quiet and undemon- strative manner. One of the brethren of the San Fran- ciso Branch managed to put up the fixings under contract, since in a few days no one ready to 
 all those schools may receive more frequent official visits, their  teachers can meet and be instructed in methods of teaching, and  their labors be placed upon a more harmonious basis. During  the summervacation they will hold a two-weeks Con- vention, to which the authorities and members of the  respective Boards of Education will be invited. All the  Boards of Education in Mexico, ^and^ Arizona have been told by  me that there would be no prospect of an appropria- tion for next year and that, therefore, all their calcu- lations must be made with that point in view.  The schools in Mexico are in a satisfactory condition with the exception of Pacheco. In order to lift that school  out of its old rut, the lo[c]al Board of Education has ap- plied to me for a Graduate from the Brigham Young  Academy. I have attended the exercises in each of them  for one whole day, except at Pacheco where one hour's  stay showed me the deplorable condition of that school.  I have instructed by special request of the Stake Presidency  all the teacher of our schools in Mexico, to pay special  attention to the Spanish language, to the Geography,  History, and Laws of Mexico, and to conduct their Arith- metic with particular reference to Mexican measures  and conditions.

 Provo, September 28,  President Wilford Woodruff,  Chairman General Board of Education.  Dear Brother;  The continuance of the financial depression [as] been very trying to our churchschools during the aca year 1894 1895. Some of the fifteen remaining stu[dents] have had to struggle not only with the almost ov[er] whelming financial difficulties, but also with  unpardonable indifference of many member's on the Boards, thus throwing the whole burden of [car] rying on the school upon the shoulders of the [teach] ers, some of whom have grown quite discoura[ged] on account of it.  Each one of our three colleges is now in a ba[d] condition in regard to attendance as well as [i[n professional work than ever before, so are the  Stake Academies at Ephraim and Preston. The  latter two are preparing for the highschool cors[es] according to the instructions from the General  Board, and in due time, will apply for the pro[per] charters. The Academies at Nephi, Rexburg, C. City, St. Joseph, Diaz, and Juarez, have been con[ducted] 
 Provo,  Decemb. 29. [189]4.  President Wilford Woodruff  Dear Brother,  After carefully considering the repres- endtations made by Dr. Talmage n the one hand, and by the Principals of our three Church Colleges on the other, I have come to the conclusion that the General Board of Education has to adopt a conservative medium bet= ween the two extremes.  Der. Talmage insists upon certain re- citations upon all church school for which demand he has no foundations The "Official Announcement" of Aug. 18, last refers only to the suspsension of the Church University and to the transfer of its intended work to the University of Utah, and making provisious for stu- dents of our faith to desire theological instructious in the L. D. S. College.  The people were exhorted also to support 
 commence our labors in representing to the people  the spirit and status of the Education among the Latterday Saints in Utah. To this end the leading institutions of our Church School Organisation had been communicated with and promises for cooperation had been obtained from the Brigham Young Academy, at Provo, and from the Latterday Saint College, at Salt Lake. Dr. James E. Talmage also contributed from his own private collection rare specimens of microsopic views. All these were to be augmented by a large con- signment of the principal publications of our Church by Geo. Q. Cannon & Sons.  For some unexplained reason much delay was experienced in obtaining our boxes from the East and our exhibit remained empty until Saturday, Febr. 24, when a portion of them were recieved, put up and made ready for opening the exhibit on Monday, Febr 26. It was a very incom- plete exhibit, as far as the educational part was concerned, for none of the things from the Brigham Young Academy had arrived yet. But the specimens in Drawing and Penman- ship from the Latterday Saint College, and Bro. Talmage's photographic views, with the Sunday School Charts helped me out considerably in that line, although compared with the other educa- tional exhibits of Santa Cruz County, St. Mary's College, Mills College, Deaf and Dumb Institute, and the

 very satisfactorily, although changes in the  principalship of the academies at Nephi, Cedar  Thatcher, and Juarez had become unavailable. Stake Board of Uintah have reopened their  Academy with an efficient principal and and fair  [pros]pects, so will Emery Stake by because of creating ^changing^  Huntington Seminary into the Stake Academy, advised by the General Board. The Stake Board at Fillmore also has written for a principal to  [illegible] their Academy, but the Stake Boards of  [Sum]mit and Parowan have not yet been heard  as concerning their intention for the coming  [scho]olyear.  The schools at Oakley and Paris have had a  [sta]gering existence during the past year, the for- mer on account of sickness which spoiled all  schools in the place for a season, and the [lat]ter on account of unsuitable locality. Even the new Stake Board of Star Valley is de- [ter]mined to have a churchschool at Afton next  [quat]er if possible.  In order to carry through more thoroughly  [the] aims of our educational system, it will be  [ne]cessary, that the circular of the First Presi- [de]ncy of June 8, 1888, respecting the establishment [of] a Board of Education in every Stake of Zion  should be enforced more emphatically, so that  the provisions of the other circular of the First Presidency, dated Oct. 20, 1890, concerning the 
 all those schools may receive more frequent official visits, their  teachers can meet and be instructed in methods of teaching, and  their labors be placed upon a more harmonious basis. During  the summervacation they will hold a two-weeks Con- vention, to which the authorities and members of the  respective Boards of Education will be invited.

 by their influence and energy the State University.  In an article on the sub- ject, explanatory to the "Official Au- nouncement; published by order of the General Board, under date of Sept. 18, last above my signature, our churchschools were instructed to consider themselves feeders to the State University. The reason for this is obvious: It is better to have our young people pursue their Univer- sity course at our home institution instead of going abroad for that purpose away from our control and influence.  All this refers enclusively to Univers- sity courses and their preparatory stages. In conformity with this understanding, our Stake Academies are now trying to arrange their curricula according to the prepared courses for highschools as near as possible.  There are, however, three Church Colleges, that are not mere Stake Academies, and have been authorized to conduct academic courses before our Church University 
 University of California, all adjoining ones on the same gallery, we stood as yet a poor show. The church- works made a fine display though, and were assisted in that by the grand picture of the First Presidency, the large picture of the Temple, representations in frame of the Latterday Saint College; the Utah Sugar Works, and a large album with the portraits of our Leaders All these furnished me abundant material for ex- planations and testimony. Notwithstanding the as yet incomplete representation of our education- al status, visitors commenced to increase daily in numbers and began to manifest greater intrest either pro or con as time went on. After several weeks of vexations delay the contribations from the Brigham Young Academy finally  ar[ri]ved and lif- ted us at once upon our equal footing, educationally  speaking, with the other exhibits on the gallery. Foremost among the B. Y. A. specimens were the two  large cases of Carving Work, of the "Pocket Knife Class" as Professor Townshend, who has charge of that de- partment there, calls it. There something like it in the Midwinter Fair, as claiming to have been done

In a long interview with the Territorial Superintendent  of Public Instruction of Arizona I obtained the promise  that the Normal Diplomas from the Brigham Young  Academy would be recognized by him and he would ^without examination^ issue to any one thus authorized issue a four years'  first class certificate to teach ^without^ in any district school  in Arizona. Our people in many localities where they  constitute the majority may, therefore, get the opportunity  of securing teachers of our own faith for their public school.  By special invitation also I visited in company with  President Hakes the Territorial Normal School at Tempe. The President Dr. Mc Nadden introduced me to the students  whom I addressed for a short time by his request. He showed us all over the building.  The Academy at Thatcher is well prepared to open again  in the fall in regard to building and fixtures, as well as  to the intelligant way in which President Kimball and his  reorganized Stake Board of Education have taken the  matter in hand. The Maricopa Stake Board of Education

In addition to this, however, I should respectfully  suggest, that each Stake Board of Education should  be instructed to at once appoint a Stake Superin= tendent of Education, as their agent, this superinten= dent ought to receive one of our Licenses signed  by President Woodruff with the seal of the GBE attached,  to give more dignity to his office, and make him  sense more clearly his responsibility.  He could be  the one with whom I could communicate in  regard to the instructions of the First Presidency  and the General Board of Education and to the  Religion classes in his stake.  Karl G.

 May 31, [189]7  President Wilford Woodruff.  Dear Brother,  The report of Bro. Allen Frost of Snowflake, Arizona, in regard to his plan for young Latterday Saints to at- tend under certain regulations the Territorial University of Arizona at Tucson, his correspondence with President Howard Billman of that institution, and the ac- companying letters of endorsement from Presidents David K. Udall and Jesse W. Smith, have been carefully considered by me.  There are two sides to the proposition of Bro. Frost which present themselves to me under following aspects:  1. While the attendance of Mormonstudents in a corporate capacity at the University of Arizona would, on the one hand, have a tendency to demonstrate to the citizens of that territory the loyality of the Saints for their home institutions, it would, on the other, be of financial advantage to the students themselves, in as much as the traveling expences in most cases could be reduced considerably.  2. I agree fully with the objection of President Jesse W. Smith, that the hot climate of Tucson is 
 had been established, and were not re- stricted in their labors after the opening of the Church University.  The "Official Announcement" nor its explanatory sup- plement of Sept. 18, could have, therefore, no application to our Church Colleges; and aAny restrictions in regard to them as prepared by Dr. Talmage are not justified by any documentary evidence, and ^They^ would deter our Church School Organization from developing that system of education which the Spirit of God has prompted the First Presidency to inaugurate in Zion.  On the other hand these three Prin- cipals of our Church Colleges have been conducting collegiate courses, parallel or of equal grade to some of those at the State University, and are asking for the privilege of organising came more. As far as these colleges have duly au- thorized professors to conduct such 
 by beginners in that line of work, and the comments, on it is not frequent and in a high terms. Specimens of Normal physical diagrams, penmanship, and drawings made up the balance. Our exhibit being thus complete, as short time of notice, limited preparations and circumstan- ces could possibly make it, a large sign in front of our booth with the legend "Latterday Saints' Educational Exhibit", gave notice to all visitors who we were. A book of visitors was opened, into which many, about 1200, have inscribed their names.  There are names from Japan, Australia, India, Palestine, Egypt, Italy, Greece, Turkey, France, Germany, Scandinavia, England, the United States, and Sandwich Islands, names of many creeds, and of all classes of society in it. With very few exceptions, each one of them had heard my testimony, and a great many more, that did not write their names. Our exhibit was opened daily at 9 AM and closed at 5 P.M. as all other educational exhibits did. We did not open on Sundays, as I had been instructed to do as Bro. Cummings, who should alternate with me Sundays, was called home, and I had none else competent to be trusted with that work and my labors cannot  be indispensable at our Sunday meetings and Sunday schools. 
 is negotiating for the lease of a very suitable building under  exceedingly favorable terms at Mesa City, and the Snowflake  Stake Board of Education has succeeded in collecting already  the greater part of six Thousand Dollars for their  new bAcademy building, for which I have drawn their  plan.  By correspondence during the last three months from  the Brigham Young Academy, Brigham Young College,  L. D. S. College, and the Stake Academies at Ephraim,  Ogden, Preston, Coalville, Oakley, Rexburg, Paris, Vernal, and  Cedar City, and from the Huntington Seminary, I learn that  that they are in a more prosperous condition than ever  before with the exception of the one at Cedar City, which  is placed at disadvantage by the establishment of the  State Normal Branch School there.  The Academies at Provo, Logan, Vernal, Paris, and  Ephraim, have either completed or are engaged in com- pleting their new or additions to the old buildings, while  Emery Stake Board of Education continues dilatory in  finishing their Academy building commenced several  years ago.

In conformity with the devision of the General Board  of Education I have divided our churchschools into  several districts, each to be provided over by one of the  Presidents of the three Colleges, as Inspector. These Inspectors 
 illy adapted for a university. Besides this arises another serious objection and that is, that the environments of that pronounced catholic town with its large Mexican population do not offer sufficient guaren- tee against questionable influences upon our young people that should go there.  It is a well known fact, that this last mentioned point in regard to questionable influences does not constitute a strong factor of consideration in the management of American High Schools.  It is a mere question of time when it shall become imperative upon the General Board of Education to create one of our Stake Academies in Arizona into a High School for preparatory courses to one of our own colleges. Such a step would ob- viate the necessity for our young people to go to Tucson in as much as that institution is neither now nor ^will be^ for a long time to come [illegible] our regular High School grade.

 classes, the General Board ought to grant their request in conformity with Gen. Circ. No. 8, pages 4 & 5, para 3.  These three Principals petition further for the right of conveying degrees with corresponding diplomas, as results of examinations held by themselves, This right has been reserved there for to the General Board, with the exception of the Brigham Young Academy, at Provo, who, as it appears, has acted arbitrarily in this matter, once or twice, and should be prohibited from repeating this irregularity.  The diplomas issued from that institution thus far, ought not to be recognised by the General Board.  But as there are many students desiring to finish their academic courses in these colleges, where they have commenced them, provided that institution is duly chartered to conduct such courses, it would be well to uncourage these institutions by issuing charters to that effect, but with such catre as the im- portance of the case required.

 June 5th 5  President Wilford Woodruff,  Dear Brother,  have a letter just received from Prof. W. J. Kesr, President of the B. Y. College, Logan, I learn that he desires to bestow certain diplomas and degrees upon Graduates from his College, during the commence- mentexercises on Thursday, June 13th. As this is pre- visely the same case as we had under considera- tion in regard to Prof. Cluff's, of the B. Y. Academy, Provo, plan, and for which I asked your consent in my letter of May 20, I suggest that you author- ize me, as it was above at Provo, to bestow these degrees to the Graduates at Logan, "in the name of the General Board of Education".  This ought to be done with the understanding that this action should establish no precedent binding the General Board of Education in formulating a final decision regarding this matter 
 G. B. E.  have been instructed to make periodical visits to  the schools under their charge, attend the Commense- ment exercises, and examinations of Graduates, and  make their reports to me. By this means our educational  system is making a very great step in advance. I respect- fully suggest, that I be authorized to call district con- ventions for the respective school districts at Poca- tello, Sale Lake, and Provo, sometime during the  summervacation, at which occasions the examina- tions for churchshoolteachers, whose licenses have  expired, could be held also.  All our Church school Boards have been instructed  by me according to the decision of the General Board to  have ^keep^ their financial records in shape so that I can  examine them at my periodical visits.  Religion Classes.  Religion Classes are now in running order in  Bannock, Bingham, Bear Lake, Cache, Box Elder,  Summit, Utah, Tooele, Sanpete, Emery, Sevier, Wayne,  Beaver, Parowan, St. Johns, Snowflake, and San Luis Stakes of Zion, while Juab, Millard, St. George, and 
 such diplomas and certificates who should apply for any position in our Church School Organization should re- port to the Church Board of Examiners for examination in Theology and give such ^additional^ evidences of their qualification as that Board may deem advisable in order to obtain a corresponding Diploma or Certificate from the General Board.  In this connection it is my duty to report that in the opinion of the ma- jority of the members of the Board of Examiners the position of Dr. Talmage as a member of the Board of Examiners is not conducive to the best interests of our churchschools.  They think that it would be but natural for the President of the University to discount the efficien- cy of Church School Examinands in favor of Graduates from the University.  Dr. Karl G.

 the upperhand here; made the most of it. Our meeting place, 927 Mission Str, was in an undigni- fied locality, with crowds of loafing and smok- ing Socialist to holding their meetings on the ground- floor at the same time, and crowding at the entrance, thus forcing ladies wanting to come to our meetings, to push their way through the best they could. The Saints saw discouraged through having to carry ^in part^ the family of the President, for  which the small Branch was not prepared. To the credit of Bro. Dalton it must be stated, however, that he has labored hard and unceasing- ly to work up this mission. His misfortune was that he had a family on his hands, when he should have been free from such anxieties, and that he had called for more missionaries then there was work for them, and finally that neither he nor his missionaries, with the exception of Bro. Cummings and to some extent, Bro. Williams, were exactly the kind of men needed in this peculiar field of labor. Of great assistance to us were our visitors to the Midwinter Fair from Zion who rendered us financial help by their liberal contributions. But above all the visits of Apostles Thatcher, Young, Smith, and Lyman, and of Elders ^Goddard^ Reynolds and Roberts have been of great benefit to us. 
 I have written Prof. Kesr, that with your per- mission I should bestow these degrees "in the name of the General Board of Education" and, as he has invited me, to deliver the Bacealar- cate address on that occasion.  I have no blanks anymore for statistical reports for all our churchschools.  The prin- cipals are clamaring for it. It is necessary that some should be printed to help me and of the difficulty.  With kind regards, Karl G. Maeser Gen. Supt  P.S. I have also no more Church School letterheads and have to use those of the B. Y. Academy.  K G. M. 
 Office of the General Board of Education. Provo, February 6, 1896.  President Wilford Woodruff, Dear Brother:  Since my last report the prospects  of our church schools have brightened in many respects, so that the  resumption of several ^church^ schools, that have been temporarily suspended, can be looked for with much confidence in the next academic year.  As already stated in my former report, my visits to the various  church schools, with the exception of the three colleges, had to be  confined to opportunities afforded me at my Sunday School appointments. This difficulty I have endeavored to partially overcome by an extensive  and to some degree exhaustive correspondence and by the monthly Church  School Papers in the Juvenile Instructor.  The Stake Academies at Rexburg, Preston, and Paris, Idaho are re- ported in a very flourishing condition, but are urgently requesting my  personal visit before April conference.  I have not seen them for two  years past; and at several points in their organization and methods  are reported as neading my personal attention.  The Stake Academy at Ogden has recently taken quite a start up- wards, but Pres. Shurtliff and the Stake Board feel reluctant to assume  the responsibility of starting the High School course, and will not  apply for such a charter at present.  The Stake Academies at Nephi, ^&^ Ephraim have made their mark in the  educational affairs of their respective localities and are looked upon  by the people as leaders in this respect.  The Brigham Young Academy at Provo has reached the highest actual  attendance she ever had, and is also in spiritual matters conforming  closer to the main object of our educational system than of late years. 
 and San Juan Stakes, are urging me to come and start them in their localities at my earliest convenience.  This work is rapidly assuming proportions that could not have been foreseen at the time of its small  beginning and soon more workers in its general  management maybe needed.  Karl G. Maeser Gen. Supt. 
 Our Sundayschool has been reorganised and brought into greater conformity with the pl instructions given by the S. S. Union Board and General Super- intendancy. My efforts in organising a Relief Society here, have thus far not been successful, but we are conducting now a testimony meeting every Thursday evening, which is also attended by strangers. The removal of our meetings to our new [gnatcters] to the "California Mission Chapel" 29 Eleventh Str, has been a great step in advances, and our mee- tings are well attended now by strangers, and in- quiring friends. A Choir has been organised, taught  and conducted until last week by my daughter, Ot- tilie. Since her return home, I have had to take charge of it myself the best way I could in singing and playing the organ, being assisted in this work by Bro. Hyde, of Ogden, who is attending here the Medical College. As the rent for this little chapel is $30.00 per month and nearly $5.00 more for the rest of the organs- gas, and water, but Bro. Mortenson is paying $10.00 out of it for seat of the basementrooms, there are still $25.00 to be raised monthly. $15.00 have 
 Although there are yet two points in that institution with which I  cannot reconcile myself. The first is the promiscuous use of the title  "Professor" on official publications of that institution by various  instructors, that are not authorized by the General Board of Education  to use that title officially, according to Gen. Circ. No. 8, page 6. The second is, the use of so called "Academy yells", notwithstanding my  repeated remonstrances, and the public censure of Apostle Brigham Young, President of the Academy Board.  The Brigham Young College, at Logan, under the judicious management of Prof. Kerr is giving great satisfaction in every respect. It is to  be hoped that any remarks to the faculty and private conversation with  Bro. Kerr in regard to emphasizing the Apirit of the Latter-day Work  somewhat more, will be followed up in future. I object to the use of  "Christian Evidences" as textbooks during the finishing course in  Theology. We have publications of our own which cover that ground far  more satisfactorily.  The Latter-day Saints College has been filled to, overflowing this  year, and needs more room for the next academic year, or the institution  will have to retrogade, which would be a calamity, and reflect disad- vantageously upon this stake of Zion.  The Stake Academy at Maricopa had to be carried on this year on the  "makeshift" principle.  The Superintendents of the Y. M. M. I. A.  volunteering to conduct the school as best he can for the time being. During my next visit there, it is to be hoped, better arrangements for  the future will be effected.  The Stake Academy at Thatcher is rapidly assuming influential  proportions, and promises to become in the near future the centre of our  educational system in Arizona.  The Juarex Academy in Mexico has been place at a great disadvant- 
 been subscribed for thus far as monthly con- tributions by members of this Branch, one half of whom are women, either widows or married to outsiders. This will be a serious question to be solved, as thus far the assistance rendered ^us^ so [matterrally] runderus by visiters to the Mid- winter Fair and $9.00 Tithing monthly from Sister Caine will cease. As there are several parties investigating the Gospel and some are ready for baptism, some hope is entertained that an increase of contributions can be looked for at an early day. The work has now begun, and many that have drifted into the Josephite Church are beginning to reflect and discover that they are on the wrong side of the fence. Much now depends how this Awa- king is kept up, and that the Lord by His Holy Spirit may bless and assist the labors of His servants in this mission in the future to the salvation of many souls, is the prayers of  Your brother in the Gospel, Karl G. Maeser 
 age this year through the retirement of Bro. Dennis Harris from the  educational field, the faithful principal for several years. The  appointment of Bro. Webb, of Snowflake, as his successor fell through  by the miscarriage of letters, and Sister Romney has taken temporary  charge of the institution.  I am now engaged in assisting the respective Boards of Education  in resuming operations for the next academic year in the Stake Academies, at Richfield, Coalville, Castle Dale (see note at end of letter), Beaver, and Snowflake.  The Board of Examiners has held two sessions since my last report, and is now engaged in examining a number of church school instructors for  certificates of the Intermediate Grade, and some for diplomas. The  results of these exam^i^nations will be reported to the General Board in  due time with the recommendations required in each case.  The Presidents of our three colleges have also been appointed by  the Board of Examiners to submit the course of studies for all those  branches for which they have been authorized by the General Board to  issue diplomas and to confer degrees. Also to submit a suggestive  High School plan for those Stake Academies that have been notified by  the General Board to apply for a High School Charter, if they choose to.  The subject of a Church School convention to be held some time during the summer vacation has been discussed at great length at the last  meeting of the Board of Examiners, and a notice to that effect has been  inserted in the February number of the Church School Papers, requesting  our fellow laborers in the Church School organization to give us the  benefit of their ideas on the subject.  The religion classes have assumed a more definite form of late in  Sevier, Sanpete, Cache and Tooele Stakes, by a method of primary teach- ing exhibited by me in several places. A lecture on this subject was 
 P.S.  After the departure of Bro. Cummings for home, the Branch at Sacramento was left in charge of Bro. Keller whose personal acquaintance I made several weeks later. Bro. Keller being entirely inexperienced in writing, it was with much difficult- ty that I could gather some informal news about the condition of the Saints there the moreso as it was impossible for me under the circumstances to pay them a visit. It appears, however, that the little life existing in that Branch went gradually down as soon Bro. Cummings had left, and Bro. Keller utterly discouraged, hence my request for his return. Two efficient elders may be able under divine guidance to revive the work.  Bros. Williams and Maycock, laboring in San Bernar- dino and vicinity, reported to me regularly their labors. From their letters it became apparent however, that the Josephites were facing things their own way in Southern California, and that these young missionaries were simply walked over. This opinion was shared by Elders Lyman and Roberts during their visit in San Bernardino, Los Angeles, and San Diego. Both young brothers, therefore, by your instruction, were transferred 
 recently given by me in the 14th Ward meeting house, which seemed to have  met the approval of several of my leading co-laborers present on the  occasion.  The growing pressure of outside influences upon our youth is a  constant source of much anxiety to me. To counteract this evil still  more with my feeble efforts, I have yielded to the solitations of  former students and of present co-laborers of mine, to consolidate all  my educational views into one book, and thus place myself on record  before the people in regard to my views on the educational effordts of  our people, their history, their final aims, and their methods. This  work is about being completed. Before publishing it, however, I would  respectfully beg the General Board to appoint a committee of at least  three, to whom I could submit the manuscript for any corrections, alterations, or amendments they should desire to be made.  I remain, with kind regards,  Your Brother in the Gospel, Karl G. Maeser, Gen. Supt.  Note: I suggest that the General Board reconsider its resolution to  create the Huntington Seminary, the Emery Stake Academy, and grant the  request of Pres. Larsen and his associates to erect a Stake Academy  building at Castle Dale, for which they they have building marterial on  the ground already. K. G. M. 
 The Gire' property reported and a visit to Dr. Schumacher U. S.  Vice Consul to Haifa.  President Wilford Woodruff & Counsellors,  Dear Brethren, Since  reporting to you last I have moved to Haifa. On my  way I formed the aquaintance of a Mr. J Tueni, of the  Turkish Legation at St. Petersbourg. He told me that his cousin Mr. George Tueni & Co were the agents and coowners with  himself in the Great Sursuk estate. As the steamer  stayed at Beyrout one whole day I landed also to see  to such business as we had in that city. I wvisited the  U. S. Consulate. The officials seemed pleased to see me &  offered their servises in our behalf when needed. At  Beyrout I also called on the Printer, Mr. Khalil Sarkis. He  seemed very anxious for our work and told me he had  counted the type on us as our property in his first esti- mate. I did not so understand it. But when he heard  I had been to Stamboul & was more familiar with prices  he seemed anxious not to loose the job.  Next, I called on Mr. Tueni & Co. They offered us the  Gire' property, with good titlle about 25,000 dollars less  than Selim Khory. They own 2/3 of the property & Mr Khory  only 1/3. If the property is wanted it can be had much chea- per I think. At the office of Mr. Tueni & Co, a Jew Mr. Osso- vetsky was introduced to me. He offered me land near  Mt Tabor. This I expect also to visit. He holds a good titlle  & claims good climate & good land & water for his land.  Mr. Tueni gave me a letter of introduction to one 
 Mr Farezli their Agent at Haifa. With him I visited  Gire'. I found the country looking very dry. This was  to be expected it is the dry season of the year. It does not  resemble the green rich looking hills we saw in  April. The country looks white with lime stones &  boulders strewn over a great deal of the hills. These were  covered with grain, grass and weeds when we saw it in  the spring, but now the whole country is cleared off  by man, beasts & the heat. The low lands on the Kishon  were also naked & the land hard as a brick. The  whole nature is slumbering in the heat patiently await- ing the early rains which are due now in a week or two.  Clouds have already been threatning rain for some  days. When the early rains arrive every thing partakes of new  life & the farmers will prepare for the next season s crops.  I found water in Sseveral plasces. The spring by the  villige good though small. There was water enough  for house use and cattle but not for irrigation. The  Kishon is completely dry from Hartich & up. That is 3 or 4  miles west of Gire-Kamon. The Manager of Gire-Ka- mon & the fellahs generally claimed they were all well  and free from Malaria. They all looked well. It is my im pression that there is not much Malaria & Sickness. the  fellahs or more troubled with eye diseases. The heat is  not so opressive though it ranges often between 80 & 100  degrees in the shade. With all the Arabs carry their Winter cloak 
 and wrap their stomachs & heads heavily. ^(A cool breeze is continually blowing from the sea.)^ I obtained  a few samples of Grain, which I will forward for your  inspection. Mr. Farezli took me to the Delieh & Roha,  two villages on the top of the hills toward Samaria,  hence nearly south of Gire'. I did not go over all  the property, but it look^ed^ like a more gentle rolling hill  country. The water suply rather better than the Gire'.  But owning to presence of more water they have also more  sickness. The fellahs claimed the streams were alowed to  spread in the Valleys below and that the Malaria had its origin  there. As soon as the Water was confined to its proper chan- nals then it would relieve them of Malaria. As the they are  several miles from the Crocodile river and bottoms it seems  impossible that they should suffer from that scourse. They  are, however, on the head waters of that Malarious stream.  The soil of either or all of these properties does not  look very rich. It appeared much better in the wet season.  The cattle look fair in flesh. Their cattle is of a very small breed.  The trees and vegatation in and around Haifa  looks much better than I had expected considering  the long summer heat & no water. Fig trees, Olive trees,  Pomegranites & some Apple trees. Allso every greens & orna mental trees of various kinds, are all looking green &  well. They await the rain, & cold weather to follow, to strip  them of their foliage. It is wonderful how nature is provided  here whereby vegitation can sustain life without Water. 
 Visit to Dr G. Schumacher U. S. Vice Consul.  Last week I called on Dr. Schumacher U. S. Vice Consul  to Haifa. He is at least a real Gentleman. He at onece  warned me against the whole Sursuk property and  against the Gire' in particular. He said the whole proper ty was in question & that only part of the Gire' property  was secure, the Government claimed the medows. Sursuk  by the agressive policy permitted here, had by degrees crow- ded the beduins off by buying a part of the land from the  Government. Had it been safe the Germans as well as the  Jews had long sinse bought it. He also spoke of the land  as being inferior in grade and the country generally un- healthy. He said the Germans had been thankful several  times that they did not buy it. They had tryed the  Kishon country & had lost many lives. To prove that the  property was in dispute he said that one of Mr. Khori's sons  desired to be his first dragoman but the Government ob- jected to his appointment on the grounds of the law suit.  I have no reasons to mistrust the Consul but I will  take steps to assertain more about it in time. Should it,  however, prove true, it would, of course, stop all negotiations  for the present relating to that property. But they do not own  the whole of Palestine, their is still a nicke chunk left of Syria.  In speaking of our intentions of settling Palestine  Dr. Schumacher said that he and the colonies would be  only too glad to assist us in our interprise, this had  been their aim & mission & that they would gladly as- 
 sist in any move which looked toward the ful- fillment of the promises to the hHouse of Israel.  He refered to the mistakes they had made in not  buying more land in the Hauran & in land. They  had spendt their strength here on the coast where there  was no room for expansion. He said if ^we^ wished they  would sell us land here for building a coast or  trading post, a place for the reception of emigrants  & for imports & exports. And that we might be co-buyers  with them in property at Tabor where they were contem plating to make a purchase for a midway villige to the  Hauran. He advised to settle the Hauran, it is now being opened up. The Jews have already three settlements.  The land is cheap. Good land for 6 francs pr acre, all fees  included. Elavation from 1500 to 3000 feet above the level  of the sea with a fine climate & good water and plenty  of it. It is generally a flat plateau country except the  Jebel ed druid [Mount Lebanon], the mountain where the druses live.  Dr. Shumacher spoke of the Druse trouble as some  thing of the past, that the Government had the control, and that the great plains of the Hauran are perfectly  safe. The Consul ought to be good authority. He has  Surveyed the whole country for the Government for  the Palestine Exprloration Fund, and English society.  His works are published & I will try to procure copies  of these valuable books for your perusal and 
 send them to you. He appeared very anxious to  have us engage with them in obtaining land. He  offered to take a trip with me to the Hauran after  the Kaiser's visit. I would like to aquaint my self with  that country personally, and if I hear nothing to the  contrary I shall probably make the trip sometime this  fall if I can arrange my business there with. Now  that the Gir  property is in doubt and no special  objective point for a settlement ^being^ in view I am left in  doubt as to what course to pursue until I hear from  you. In reading our letter of instructions it appears  to me that we have are yet far from being thoroughly  familiar with every portion of the land that would  be likely to furnish a suitable place for gathering." We  have followed largely the popular routes, but the out of the way places which offer better oppertumities for development  by improving the roads & transportation facilities we do not  nknow anything about. The Consul smiled at the idea  of the Government refusing to allow roads to be built. He  said that was chiefly against the Jews in order to hinder  their advancement & to squeeze money out of them. Yet I  know personally that the Government often prevents the natives  from building roads. I supose there are difficulties but I believe  they can be overcome by patience and the help of the Lord.  Respecting titles, he said that we could safely buy and  receive good titles without much trouble. We had to be care 
 ful to see that our titles were properly issued at first  and the limits well defined. Then if any local officer  would object to the transfer the Consul would fix the rest  by ordering the transfer through the Vali. We have better  treaty rights than other nations said Dr. Schumacher &  we have no trouble in maintaining them. He said  Their worst trouble was with the U. S. Minister in  Constantinople. For many years no there was no question  of their pass ports. But Minister Terril, a former  Minister had raised a point that America had no  colonization policy and that those who intended to re side permanently abroad would not be protected. They  had only saved themselves by stating that they were here in the Spiritual interest of the people. Should this be  found an objection to us we could probably have that ar- ranged by our representatives in Congress.  The reception I have received from Vice Consul Schu macher has been a surprise to me. I hope it will take  no unfavorable reaction. I hope it is based on some un derstanding between him and the leading Elders of the Colo ny; as he has made several unreserved propositions to  cooperate with us. I believe the colonists have done  fairly well this year. Brother Gran grow & Brother ^Hilt^ say they have  done well in wine. I claim continually that this Temple  society with all their oddities and old country, old fashioned  way have proved beyound a doubt the possibility of inha- 
 biting and living fairly well in Palestine. How much  better cannot we do it who are farmore advanced in the  method of agriculture and progress in general and less wrapt in old superstions and traditional ways.  At present I would not advise any Elder sent here ^to labor among the Germans.^  I think that when we commence to gather here the Lord  will move upon the people to receive the Gospel. The old fellows  will not listen to the Gospel, they have partially rejected it, but the  coming generation is different, and if we raise no opposition at  present by trying to convert their children to a faith which they  fancy is the worst of all, Then it seems to me we can probab ly work in harmony with them and when we are established  in the land the Lord s are bound to come to Him as they  are as a comunity decaying & ^the aged^ old dying off gradually. We  will preach more effectually with our works, and I believe  we have much to gain among these honest, wellmeaning people.  Hoping you may be able to find some good in  my feeble efforts & something worthy of your consi- deration in my reports from time to time, and further  that you will instruct me how to proceed I remain  as ever your humble fellowlaborenr in the everla- sting covenant.

 Apostle W. Woodruff quotes "A poor wayfaing man" &c Said that was the last song that Joseph & Hyrum Smith listened to. It was sung to them by our present Pres- ident John Taylor just before the mob made their break upon the jail.  Spoke on the follney of riches. Rehearsed the story of Nebuchadnezzar, Told how he gloried in his wealth and greatness and of his fate. ##Daniel 3## We can put no trust in riches.  Hoped the Lord would never give him so much riches that he couldnt pay his tithing ^and offerings^ out of it. It is a living miracle to see this great people in these mountains and yet many of us forget who we are and the work we have to do. 
 President Woodruff said the Lord has never undertaken a work he has not been able to perform. This is God's work and we shall not be disappointed in its progress and final issue. Had no fears in regard to these things. It is not in the power of man to stop this work. God has command with the Gentiles that they may be left without ex- cuse in the day of God's power. His work among the house of Israel will also roll on. Chil- dren will be born after the 1st of Jany Edmunds bill or no Ed. bill. No power can stop it or the onward progress of this Kingdom. Desired to see the Saints humble themselves before the Lord and do their duty. 
 Isaiah, the Prophet, ages ago, wrote in great plainness the history of this people. He plainly foretold all the scenes through which we have passed. We are here in direct fulfillment of the prophesies of this great man. We have laid the foundation of the greatest work ever com- menced on this earth. Would to God that the veil might be taken off the faces of this people for just one five minutes that they might get a glimpse of their position as it is. We do not realize the work that is before us. 50,000,000,000 of our race in the Spirit world and looking to us for salvation. Jos. Smith and hundreds of others who have gone behind the veil with the priesthood are preaching the Gospel to them and it is for us to provide temples and work therein for the dead. We are connected with the great dispensation of the Fulness of Times. In view of these things will we act the fool by turning away from the truth. We are all too far from the Lord. It is time for us to draw near to him and to keep his commandments. Had had a great deal of sor- row in his time but had never sorrowed to follow a good man to the grave. Could never see any cause for sorrow in such an event. When a man apostatizes that is a time to mourn. Did not want to live long enough to apostatize. Felt very anxious about the youth & maidens of this people. Desired very much to see them exercizing faith in God. The signs of all heavens & earth pro- tend the near coming of the Son of Man. We should be preparing for this glorious event. Dont forget who you are and dont forget your duties as Saints (26 ms)

The real  petition uses such flourishes in adress & expression which are  hard to translate ^as I am no deplamat.^. But this I am assured is what we

 B.  THE OTTOMAN PORTE. Treaty concluded May 7, 1830 (Commerce and Navigation).  1596. ARTICLE 11.  The Sublime Porte may establish S h a h b e n d e r s (Consuls) in the United States of America, and the United States may appoint  their citizens to be Consuls or Vice-Consuls at the commercial places  in the dominions of the Sublime Porte where it shall be found need- ful to superintend the affairs of commerce. These Consuls or Vice- Consuls shall be furnished with b e ra t s  or f i r m a n s ; they  shall enjoy suitable distinction, and shall have necessary aid and  protection.  1597. ARTICLE 1V.  If litigations and disputes should arise between subjects of  the Sublime Porte and citizens of the United States, the parties shall not be heard, nor shall judgments be pronounced, unless the American Dragoman be present. Causes in which the sum may exceed five hundred piasters shall be submitted to the Sublime Porte, to be decided accord- ing to the laws of equity and justice. Citizens of the United States of America, quietly pursuing their commerce, and not being charged or  convicted of any crime or offense, shall not be molested; and even  when they may have committed some offense they shall not be arrested  and put in prison by the local authorities, but they shall be tried  by their Minister or Consul, and punished according to their offense, following, in this respect, the usage observed toward other Franks. 1  1598. ARTICLE V.

ARTICLE 1X.  If any merchant-vessel of either the contracting parties should  be wrecked, assistance and protection shall be afforded to those of  the crew that may be saved, and the merchandise and effects which it  may be possible to save and recover shall be conveyed to the Consul nearest to the place of the wreck, to be by him delivered to the pro-  1.

 prietors.  Protocol concluded August 11, 1874 (Right of Foreigners to hold real estate in the Ottoman Empire).  1600.  PROTOCOL.  The law granting foreigners the right of holding real estate does  not interfere with the immunities specified by the treaties, and which  will continue to protect the person and the movable property of  foreigners who may become owners of real estate.  As the exercise of the right of possessing real property  may induce foreigners to establish themselves in larger numbers  in the Ottoman Empire, the Imperial Government thinks it proper  to anticipate and to prevent the difficulties to which the appli- cation of this law may give rise in certain localities.  Such is  the object of the arrangements which follow.  The domicile of any person residing upon the Ottoman soil  being inviolable, and as no one can enter it without the consent  of the owner, except by virtue of orders emanating from the compe- tent authority and with the assistance of the magistrate or fun- ctionary invested with the necessary powers, the residence of foreign- ers is inviolable on the same principle, in conformity with the  treaties, and the agents of the public force cannot enter it with- out the assistance of the Consul or of the delegate of the Consul  of the power on which the foreigner depends.  By residence we understand the house of inhabitation and its  dependencies: that is to say, the out-houses, courts, gardens, and  neighboring inclosures, to the exclusion of all other parts of the  property.  In the localities distant by less than nine hours' journey  from the Consular residence, the agents of the public force cannot  enter the residence of a foreigner without the assistance of a Con- sul, as was before said.  On his part the Consul is bound to give his immediate assistance  to the local authority, so as not to let six hours elapse between  the moment which he may be informed and the moment of his departure,  or the departure of his delegate, so that the action of the author- ities may never be suspended more than twenty-four hours.  In the localities distant by nine hours or more than nine  hours of travel from the residence of the Consular Agent, the agents  of the public force may, on the request of the local  authority,  and with the assistance of three members of the Council of the El- ders of the Commune, enter into the residence of a foreigner, with- out being assisted by the Consular Agent, but only in case of urgency,  and for the search and the proof of the crime of murder, of attempt  at murder, of incendiarism, of armed robbery either with infraction  or by night in an inhabited house, of armed rebellion, and of the  fabrication of counterfeit money, and this entry may be made whether  the crime was committed by a foreigner or by an Ottoman subject, 
 and whether it took place in the residence of a foreigner or not in  his residence, or in any other place.  These Regulations are not applicable but to the parts of the  real estate which constitute the residence, as it has been heretofore  defined.  Beyond the residence, the action of the police shall be exercised  freely and without reserve; but in case a person charged with crime  or offense should be arrested, and the accused shall be a foreigner,  the immunities attached to his person shall be observed in respect  to him.  The functionary or the officer charged with the accomplishment  of a domiciliary visit, in the exceptional circumstances determined before, and the members of the Council of Elders who shall ass^i^st him, will be obliged to make out a proc s-verbal of the domiciliary visit, and to communicate it immediately to the superior authority under  whose jurisdiction they are, and the latter shall transmit it to the  nearest Consular Agent without delay.  A special regulation will be promulgated by the Sublime Porte  to determine the mode of action of the local police in the several  cases provided heretofore.  In localities more distant than nine hours' travel from the  residence ofthe Consular Agent, in which the law of the judicial organ- ization of the Velayet may be in force, foreigners shall be tried,  without the assistance of the Consular Delegate, by the Council of  Elders, fulfilling the function of justices of the peace, and by the  tribunal of the canton, as well for actions not exceeding one thousand  piasters as for offenses entailing a fine of five hundred piasters  only at the maximum.  Foreigners shall have, in any case, the right of appeal to the  tribunal of the arrondissement against the judgments issued, as above  stated, and the appeal shall be followed and judged with the assist- ance of the Consul, in conformity with the treaties.  The appeal shall always suspend the execution of a sentence.  In all cases the forcible execution of the judgments, issued on the conditions determined heretofore shall not take place without  the co-operation of the Consul or of his Delegate.  The Imperial Government will enact a law which shall determine  the rules of procedure to be observed by the parties in the applica- tion of the preceding regulations.  Foreigners, in whatever locality they may be, may freely submit  themselves to the jurisdiction of the Council of Elders or of the  tribunal of the canton without the assistance of the Consul in cases  which do not exceed the competency of these councils or tribunals, res reserving always the right of appeal before the tribunal of the  arrondissement, where the case may be brought and tried with the  assistance of the Consul or the Delegate.  The consent of a foreigner to be tried, as above stated, without  the assistance of his Consul, shall always be given in writing and in  advance of all procedure. 
 It is well understood that all these restrictions do not con- cern cases which have for their object questions of real estate,  which shall be tried and determined under the conditions estab- lished by the law.  The right of defense and the publicity of the hearings shall  be assured in all cases to foreigners who may appear before the  Ottoman tribunals, as well as to Ottoman subjects.  The preceding dispositions shall remain in force until the  revision of the ancient treaties, a revision which the Sublime  Porte reserves to itself the right to bring about hereafter by an  understanding between it and the friendly powers.  If I under^stood^ General Dickensen right   all questions of title to real estate  are handled by our Legation in  behalf of United States Citizens.  F. F. H.

 Report on Printing  President Woodruff & Counsellors  Dear Brethern.  From Apostle Lund I  learn that the printing of some tracts have  been considered & that the probable cost would be $400. 00/100  I beg leave to report that Bro. Binyad has  called the President of the Censor Board and is  informed that for about $250. 00/100, (not to exceed this amount) we can get a general or full permission  to print any and all of our works, subject, of course,  to the sensor counscil the same as all others.  But  when the Permission is given by the Minister  of Public instruction & those whose business it is  to sign; Then we are recognized as publishers &  can open our own printing press etc.  We can  also publish our pamplets & books here much  cheaper so that I think that there is no question  but that we will be able to get the Permission &  also print all four tracts suggested for the  $40000 here in Constantinople.  I should recom mend this course. No money until permission  is ready for signature & complete.  This much  alone would be a great help. That one branch  of the Government assists the other in recog nizing us.  Printing permits also shows the  officers in the Country that we are recognized. I am informed that the recognition by the 
 government does in no case include the  printing privilidge which is independantly  controled by the Minister of Public instruc- tions & the Censor Councill. We will there fore need this permit in all cases and will  have to make the petition seperately.  Brother Binyad has experience in these  matters as he had a permission nearly ready  for us once but when the Elders here could  not furnish the money the Seventh-day Ad- vents got it and now have it although they  are not recognized. The President of the Censor board  was not pleased with it as he would rather  we should have had it as the Advents have  been offensive in their publcations for  which several were arrested. Bro. Binyad had a  couple of days of it before he could prove he  was no Advent. This because his name had  been connected with the permit.  Please give me your instructions in re gard to this matter at your earliest con vinience so that I may proceed accordingly  Respectfully F. F. Hintze 
 Investigation of  correspondence be- tween the U.S. Legation & the  Porte  President Woodruff & Counsellors. Dear Brethern,  I called at the Legation to investigate the assertion  of U.S. Marshall Allaimby. That the Legation of the U.S. had of- fered its good office to help supress Mormonism.  I found  the Marshall was correct.  It appears that in Oct 1887, the  Turkish Government had been stuffed about us opening a prin ting press & that the editor Mr. Hintze lived at Kom Kapoo, and that they wished the legation to supress it.  Oct 30, 1887  Someone whose name is not attached, came near forgetting  the complaint in his attempt to blackmail Mormonism.  He tells  the Porte that Mormism was a Statuary crime in America &  a disgrace upon civilization, & that they would do all in their  power to help supress Mormonism & to prevents its spread in  Turkey.  It is an interesting peice of deplomacy, cheifly because  of its cowardly attack.  The writer wanted to stigmatize polyga- my but did not dare to mention it where^fore^ he beats around the  corner with interesting eloquence.  On Nov 30. the Consuls writes that he has been notified that the government had re- peeded its complaints, telling the Consul that they did not complain  of the subject matter, it was only the unlawful printing  without permission they opposed.  Consul General Mr. Pringle  then tells the Legation that he had seen Mr. Hintze & that it was  was all settled by Mr. Hintze delivering up the tracts. (The tracts in question were a few german tracts published by Elders  Spori, Tanner & myself.  The publisher assured us it was allright  & that no one would question it. But an Armenian betrayed us) With this explanation the affair was settled.  About that time  I had had a number of visits with different high of- 
 ficials and they were somewhat informed on  Mormonism. And Mr. Allaimby is authority for the  statement, that the Porte snubed ^the^ Minister by telling  him that the Mormons would be protected as others & had the same right: The Turks saw the sceme and they  were too smart to be caught. I could not get a copy. When  Mr Riddle saw the nature of it, it made him a little nervous  and he said with a smile: "Well, I guess that is all burried,  is it not? I, of course repyed it was. I saw he was ashamed  of it so I did not press it. And although we can ge it through  the State deparment at Washington, I think it best to leave it  til later on. It ^will^ makes a little history someday. It is very  encouraging right now to know that the Porte has  taken our part even when attacked by our own. Representation. Upon solicitation I explained our faith to Mr. Riddle. He  listened with attention & interest. Also Consul General  Dickensen gave me a lengthy audience.  Marshall Allaimby loves to speak of his stay in Utah. He speaks in high terms of our people. He remembers Presidents Woodruff, Cannon & Smith. Also Dr. Park and others. He has offered me his servises several times. He also  refers to Mr. Strauss, the coming Minister, as a liberal minded & fair & just man. Mr. Strauss is a Hebrew  & as such may do us much good. The reply itself from  the Porte I did not see, but Con. Gen. Pringles letter I  saw and it bears out the claim of Mr. Allaimby.  Respectfully F. F. Hintze. 
 Prest. Wilford Woodruff. Felt to bear his testimony to the work of God, and refered to the Mission to Mexico said we had made a purchase of land in Mexico said there was no objection to going there but while the brotheren were in a situation to do good and hold the franchise he would rather they would stay here in the settlements A.

Saw it did not pay any person to commit sin we could not afford it we would lose every time spoke of the work done in the Temple and of some entering into these Temples unworthy and committing sin by whore- dom before marrage and the fault was on the man nearly always this is a greivous sin in the sight of God our heavely Father. spoke of the sealing power of the Holy Priesthood union for time and eternity having our wives seald and to continue this union through all eternity we ought to live in unity and love and never dissent or quarrel be kind to your wives and they will be kind in return whether you have one or many we shall meet one of these days in that land that the Edmunds Law has no jurisdiction in celestial glory if we are faithful spoke of the Holy Priesthood and its power in the past generations and that we hold this power in our day and we have greater blessings in this age than any people that ever dwelt on the face of the earth. spoke of the power reaching behind the vail. and operating in the interest of the dead the millions that are waiting their redemption in the spirit wourld. This power is revealed to Jos Smith in these last days. he and Joseph Smith and other  had baptized for the dead in the Missisippi river and had done it in such a hirry thay they had no record^er^ only himself. the Lord told Joseph he was to much in hurry there should be a recorder appointed bore testimony of his work in St George Temple and of the great work done for the dead and of the sealing ordinances for the dead and the great work of redemption of the great numbers that are past away spoke of the neglect on the part of some in this respect in laboring for their dead friends the eldest should do the work but they should not stand in the way for others to do it. he had baptized his eldest Brother but did not do much more so it fell on him to work for the dead of his Fathers house was glad to Finish his work exhorts all continue in the good work and be united and never become divided 
 ^6 Febr. 1890^  President Wilford Woodruff & Councillors, Salt Lake City, Utah.  Dear Brethern.  In compliance with your request I cheer- fully place on paper my report of the Turkish mis- sion, and hope I may be able to so write as to  give you a proper and comprehensive understand- ing of the work of the Lord in that part of His vineyard.  I left Utah for my field of labor in Turkey on  the first day of Nov. 1886 and arrived in Constanti ple on the 16th of Jan. 1887 remaining about 6 weeks in  England in order to obtain a passport. Shortly af- ter arriving at Constantinople I was appointed  by Prest. Jacob Spori & Elder J. M. Tanner to the  Armenian quarter of Stanboul there to live and  study the Turkish language and to become better  aquainted with ^the^ natives and their customs.  I at once began studying the Turkish langu- age which I was quite successful in acquiring  for the purposes required. We, however, found  but little response among the people in Constan tinople, but it soon became evident that  we could do some work in the interior  of Asia Minor, wherefore, I recommended 2 more  Elders to come to my assistance. Shortly after,  about Nov. 1887, Elder James Clove arrived, who  after staying about 2 year became sick and was 
 released to return home. In the winter between  1887 & 1888, at the reuquest of Brother Markow I went  to Hungaria to baptize his parents. His brother and  sister-in-law, but as they needed some more  information I waited a couple of days during  which time I and Brother Markow testified to  many in the villige of Serb Czernia, Hungaria. But on the third day I was called before  the preist, a Greek orthodox, and then sent to  the magistrate by whom I was ordered to  leave the country forthwith. I failled  in my attempt to open ^up^ the gospel in that  land at that time, but I firmly believe that  good will yet be realized from my labors there.  I there ordained Brother Markow and Elder and  appointed him to labor as best he could and thus  intdirectly my labors resuleted in the Gospel being ope- ned up in Belgium. Of the work done at Antwer- ben you are, I beleive, fully advised. Brother Markow  has since been been requested to come to Hungaria to  baptize his parents. In the latter part of Aug. 1888 I  left Constantinople for a trip through Asia Minor  with a veiw to see the people and what the prospects  were for opening up the door of life there, and also  to visit the saints in Palestine. In the spring of  1889 in company with Elder J. M. Sj dahl I visited  the Holy land, Palestine, and in the summer the 
 same year I returned to Constantinople preach ing by the way. I baptized 6 persons on this trip,  I3 of which were local preachers and one a young  teacher.  I baptized was released in Dec. to return home by President George Teasdale having been  in Turkey 3 years within a few days. Altogether I  injoyed my mission very much and felt I was  very much blessed of the Lord and feel sure that  our united labors in that field will yet result in  much good.  Several elders have been sent to labor in  Turkey since I arrived, but according to the best  of my knowledge most of them are either released  or soon will be, some because of sickness others  because of lack of means and, perhaps, but little  faith in that mission. There has been about 30  baptisms in that mission and we have many warm  freinds.  The difficulties in establishing the Gospel in Turkey  are many. In order to preach the Gospel success- fully there we should be recognized by the Govern ment. We have petitioned for recognition but have  obtained none cheifly because no means were  at our command to pay our way.  Printing could not be done to any appriciable  extent because we were not recognized.  While wvisiting Palestine I became convinced 
 that in order to successfully preach the Gospel in  the orient and to do those people any marked good  that it would be nessesary to colonize there. Some  of my reasons for this wevirew are these. The Turkish  ^mission^ is so far from our mountain home in Utah that  the expences to thouroughly prosecute a long and  successful mission are very heavy, hence Elders are  few who can meet that demand, and the expences toge- ther with the strange customs and habits of the  natives tend to discourage the brethern. Then  it is far for the poor saints to emigrate, and they  are but poorly prepared to come to Zion as they are  but not at all acquainted with our customs  and mode of living. Again, it is prohibited by law  to emigrate from Turkey; and that to-gether with  the jealousy of our own nation would be against  oriental emigration to Zion. But on the other hand  could we obtain a home in that ancient land of  promise, we could there educate the saints to our  ways and prepare them to receive both temporal  and spiritual progress. The saints there are  fully imbued with the spirit of gathering,  wherefore they are anxiously looking forward  to the day they may be priveleged to gather with  the saints to Zion. That land is also the destiny of the  Jews, and inasmuch as we are destined to do a great  work ffor them, we will be there prepared to do them 
 good and to assist them in every way at our command.  My impressions respecting Palestine as a land to  sustain life are very good, and though but little  can be said of the signs of the fruitfulness of the land returning, yet there are sufficient demonstrations  that if God had a people there whom he felt to  especially bless the land would be a good land much  to be desired. There is a good deal of vacant  land in various parts of Gallelee and alto also on the Jordan and on the other side in the  country that Reuben, Gad & the half tribe of Manassa  inherited. [##Deuteronomy 29:8##] This land may be obtained by ferman  from the Sultan, and much easier if it can  be had through the natives as we will be able  to do, as the Turks are more or less afraid of  foreignors.  There is no price on land in Turkey. It is  cheifly disposed off in Turkey as gifts and in order  to obtain these land gifts, backshish, or money  gifts are nessesary. The heaviest expences are  here, hence we have no certainty how much it may  cost. It will, however, not depend on the quantity of the Land only to advance the backshish.  I have no idea that we can do much less  than 30,000 dollars and it may take much  more. And then it will take something to cover ex pences pending the transaction which generally takes 
 long in Turkey as they are a slow, easy-going people.  First a permit would be nessesary to go to Palestine  to locate land and to make the nessesary surveys. Then we would have to return to Constantinople to  finish negotiations which would take some time  because in obtaining land and title it would be  nessesary to have our rights and privileges as  a religious body properly defined.  Should an effort on our part to build up the  land of Israel at this time be right before the Lord  and His servants, I would suggest that the Brethern  appointed to locate lands and to negotiate for  their purchase make it a point to be there about  March or April, because the heat is oppressive in  summer and the country almost impassable in  the rainy season in the winter. Some time would  also be necessary to obtain the nessesary papers from  the Sultan & Sorte to travel and locate lands, for  this reason time should be alowed from home  in order to prevent rushing.  For the good of the work of the Lord in the  Orient, I would respectfully ask your early consideration regarding this matter, as I  do not see how we can do much there  until we do something permanantly  for the redemption of the Land of Israel and  thus come into closer communication 
 with the people. There are many millions of peo- ple to whom we can testify, and for whom we can do much good if we become in closer contact with  them; and then we could do much of the mission  work with native help.  I feel that a sufficient number of good  familyies should be called from Zion to go to Palestine  to settle permanantly & not expect to return  very soon at any rate. The land is good and a  land of promise, and I see nothing to which any one in  terested in this great Latter-day-work could ofbject to  so far as moving there to live is concerned. It will  furnish a new and interesting feature in our  mission work, and if honestly & faithfully engaged  in cannot fail to bring down the smiles and  approbations of our heavenly Father.  In conclusion let me say I feel specially  blessed and privileged in my labors and that  I feel indevidually much benifited and hope God  will give me grace to put it to good use.  Praying God ever to bless you with His  Holy Spirit and to protect you from all evil, and ever praying God to deliver His oppressed  people, I am as alway your humble servant,  F. F. Hintze.

 Aintab, Turkey 6th February 1890.  To the Ffirst Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints:  Beloved Brethren,  It becomes my painful duty to commnu- itcate to you the sor^r^owful news, that our dear Brother in Christ, and fellow laborer, Elder Edgar D. Simmons, departed this life  day before yesterday, Tuesday, ^the^ 4th of February 1890 at 2 p.m. after sickness of 2 weeks, of  which the last 8 days have been very painful. He died onf the small pocksx, his last moments, however, were peaceful. His voice began to fail him ^gradually^ during the last days of his sickness,  and during the last day he was allmost unable to speak, but he was able to understand questions put to him.  This is a sorrowful event for the whole Church of Jesus Christ as also for the relatives of the deceased, but it is a consolation to us all, 
 that he died as a faithful member in the church of Jesus Christ.. The funeral took place yesterday, February 5th at 3 p.m. in the Armenian cemetery. The Protestant Priest told Brother "Vezirian," that, provided we wished it so, he would speak at the services; and on account of my inability to make a  speech in the Turkish language, I gave my conseant. At the a^p^pointed time he came, and after the body was put in the coffin, he spoke in the house as well as also afterwards at the  grave.  I have dressed our departed brother as well as I had understanding to do, and ordered  the coffin painted white. I found at the arrival of the coffin, that it was covered with white cloth, tacked all over it, and on the  corners and edges were black strips and black rosettes, fastened with brassheaded nails. On account of it being allready over the above the allotted time to keep a corpse, we had to  hurry to put the body into the coffin, and  left every thing the same way as described. 
 I do not the address of Brother Edgar D. Simmons' relatives, therefore I ask  you, the first Presidency of the Church, to kindly inform them as also likewise to express  to them my best regards and condolence.  It would have given me great satisfaction if Bro. Simmons could have returned to his beloved ones at home, but God had ordained  it otherwise. It was a hard time for the  departed, because he had the malady in the very worst degree.  Just now I received a telegram from my stepfather G. Grau, at Haifa, ^Syria,^ to leave this  place, and therefore, as fast ^soon^ as I can make it possible to go, I shall do so, and will take  Bro. Simmons' effects with me to Haifa, and his relatives can write to me there their address  and directions concerning his things.  Please let this suffice, as theis letter has to be  posted right away. My best regards to the  first Presidency, hoping this letter may find You all well. Your Brother in the Gospel  Friedrich Dieterle.  address: Haifa Syria.

 Jaffa  October 10, 1889  Sir  Whilst I acknowledge the  receipt of your welcome letter I  regret to say that that letter did not  remain long in my possession  thinking it would be but right that  my friend Mr Sjodahl should read its contents so that two days  after I had received it I gave  it to him for that purpose but  to my great disappointment I  learned from him few days after  that he lost it and that he could  n't tell how it happened but I  attributed its loss to his having  been very much engaged with  several of the latter day Saints  who  To Wilford Woodruff, Esq [illegible] Salt Lake City Utah 
 who had arrived about that time  at Jaffa however I console myself for its temporal loss by  entertaining a hope that you  will kindly furnish me with  a copy of the same  Please to accept my most sincere  thanks for the book you kindly sent me of the life of Joseph Smith  which lately and only lately I  have begun to read having been  prevented from doing so earlier  by serious illness which lasted  several weeks and even now  I cannot fairly say I am quite  convalescent but am glad to say  that during all the time of my  sufferings I always felt very  happy and cheerful by the  help of my Redeemer. I am also  very thankful to the good Mr Sjodahl for having visited me  often during my sickness. 
 You must have heard ere this that he with the aid of some of  the Saints have Baptized about  a fortnight ago two of my country- men who for a long time past are  very desirous to go to Utah and  if they could be pecuniarly helped  in attaining that object I am  fully persuaded that when they  return they will be of great use  not only to those who have been  their benefactors but also to their  own country-men. I was glad to  hear that the scheme mentioned  in my letter to you with regard  to the establishment of a Colony  and a mission in Palestine has  ben set before you for consideration  and should ever such a  project be carried out I shall  not only endeavorer to forward  Your interest as much as lieth in power but I hope to be 
 able also at the time to present  you (as a gift) in virtue of a  legal title Deed a suitable  plot of ground for a cemetery  for a Mission House and a garden  joining it Six Thousand square  pics or ^about^ one and a half English acre  would be necessary. The locality  of the suggested Colony should  not be farther than twelve of  Fifteen miles from this Town  The price of land for building  purposes varies according to  situation and distance from the  town of Jaffa for instance at  a quarter miles' distance is from  five shillings to ten shillings the square pic (a square pic is equal to two thirds of an  English yard farther on from  one to five shillings from  square pic. The prices here  given are these of the land 
 which is situated on the South of  Jaffa where Christians mostly liked  for being the healthiest locality  in the neighbourhood  The price of land for a colony  is from 35 to 50 Thirty Five to Fifty  shilling each acre and I would  before going further draw your  attention to the fact that the Heads  of the Christians Churches here  are apt to make great difficulties  and opposition to any new settlers  coming here to buy lands in  Palestine whatever their persuasion  may be therefore these Prelates  will be very injurious to the cause  if they knew before hand what  your purposes are consequently  I would hereby suggest that if  ever it should come to pass that  you should decide to buy land here  please to send out for the  execution of the same one of 
 the latter day Saints known  amongst you as being wise, cautious and discreet otherwise  the whole plan (hoped for) will  prove totally a failure but I  think that if Mr Sjodahl should remain in Palestine  until such a time comes he  would be just the person to  carry it out  Please remember me kindly  to all the Bishops Elders and  Patriarch of your church and  with kind regards to yourself  Believe me to be  Respectfully and most  truly Yours M.

 Jaffa, Palestine,  June 23rd 1889 President Wilford Woodruff Salt Lake City Dearly beloved and much esteemed brother, It has been upon my mind these last days that I should write you a few lines and let you know that I am alive and happy in the discharge of my duties, although they are widely different from what I formerly was accustomed to, as a clergyman of the world.  But I thank God for His mercy towards me and especially for the light He has given me through  His chosen servants of the gospel.  When I came here to Palestine, I was soon made aware of the fact, that I was placed face to face with millions of human beings, to whom the latter-day message has never sounded.  I mean the Arabian speaking nations, who are scattered all over Syria, Arabia, Egypt and a large part of Africa.  And my prayer to God was that He would lead me and make an opening by which the light of His gospel would shine through.  And it appears to me that the prayers are now being answered, in as much as I have ^found^ several 
 friends who diligently inquire into the principles of the gospel and some have already applied for baptism -- One of these inquirers I would like to make you and the brethren at home nearer acquainted with.  He is Mr. Mousa Tannus, a man of high cultivation and much influence among his people.  He knows perfectly besides his own tongue (the Arabic) Turkish, French, English and Greek.  A few years ago, during a persecution which the Protestants suffered in Syria, he rendered eminent service in inducing the Turkish government to remove the instigators of the persecution from their of- fices.  I am now almost a daily guest at the house of this gentleman, and he has intro- duced me to ma^n^y people here in Jaffa and also to a relative of his, the English Proconsul of Jerusalem, thus giving me a chance to bear my humble testimony in many places where I otherwise would have found no enterance.  Yesterday I was called to a prominent family and asked to lay my hands on and pray for a sick  child.  I did so, and hope God will answer my prayer, to the honor of His name.  --Now Mr.  Tannus has asked me, if it would not be con- sidered improper for him to put himself in connection with the brethren at home by 
 the means of correspondence.  I have told him, I think not.  I suppose, on the contrary,  that, if he would find time to write to you about the country here, its inhabitants and prospects of evangelisations, it would be per- used with interest, and that you would also find time to send him a friendly an- swer, encouraging him to go forward and take the step fully out, as Saint of God.  For a man in his position, it is no small thing to become a "Mormon" in this country, and I  do not know, whether the Spirit can prevail over him or not.  But he is certainly very "nearly persuaded".  A word from home might materially assist him.  I would also be very glad, if some one at home would be kind enough to present him with President G. Q. Cannon's Life of Joseph Smith.  Because that is the very book which he now aught to read.  I  have not got it myself, or, I would gladly have given it to him.  I have given him "The Voice of Warning" and "Orson Pratt's works" I would also like to have the "Deseret News"  come to him.  If the News Company will send him the Weekly for one year, that can be charged to my account with the News.  His address is: Mousa Tannus, Esq.  Jaffa, Palestine, Syria. 
 With respect to those Arabs who have asked to be baptized, I have thought ^but^ to [be] go slowly.  I have formed a bible class and they come every day and we read the Word of God and talk it over.  If they prove faithful, they will be bap- tized.  They are men of bright intellects, but no information.  Well, I suppose I must no make my epistle too long.  I with that ^God^ may bless you abundantly.  I  also wish to be very kindly remembered to Apostles F. D. Richards, Moses Thatcher, Henry Smith, whom I  have the honor of personally knowing.  If I may hope for a few words from you, my present address is J. M. Sjodahl, care of Henry Vocken- roth, Jaffa, Palestine, Syria. Your humble Servant J M Sjodahl 
 Jaffa June 26, 1889.  Dear Sir  Little did I think few months ago, nor could I have even dreamed that I should now be writing to the Honorable President of the latter day Saints of Salt Lake City Utah which fact I look upon as being of a predestinated character inasmuch as am made to feel that I am in duty bound to be one of the Instruments in the forwarding to a certain extent the cause of the latter day saints in Palestine relative to the speedy Advent of our Lord Jesus and the necessity of true repentance which I will endeavour by Gods' help to infuse into the minds of the natives upon every available opportunity: as regard myelf I dont see as yet the necessity of baptism though on the other hand I think it is right that enquirers should be baptised in due time in conformity with the ordinances of the Church of the latter day Saints.  Before I was acquainted with Mr Sjodahl I knew hardly any thing about the Mormons until I read the books which  To  Wilford Woodruff Esqr. Salt Lake City, Utah Tar U. S. of America 
 which he kindly sent me from Caiffa and  after having carefully read them I was  pleased to find that I became enlightened  upon various subjects of which I was totally  ignorant before, and now before going  further to another subject I must here  mention that for the last four or five  weeks I have seen much of Mr Sjodahl  and consequently I introduced him to  several respectable families whom we  visited several times in their respective  houses and on each visit I could not  help admiring the zeal and quiet  manner ^which^ he exhibited in the propagation  and elucidation of the truths of the  Holy Scriptures and I was much gratified  to find that his hearers were impressed  by his teaching and therefore I am  fully persuaded that by God's help  the latter day Saints of Utah will live to  see before long the fruit of the labours  of their good Missionearies in Palestine  fully realized provided that this all  important testimony of the Advent of  Christ will not cease from being speedily  born to the millions who in these  counties live ignorant therof in, 
 inasmuch as the teachings of the  ecclisiastics of the Greek Orthodox  Church and that of any other  denomination except the Protestant Churches have hardly any good  impression upon the people.  Vices are not exhibited as such, and what wee need is, men who  by the power of God can teach the  people the necessity of repentance  on the strength of the Advent of  our Lord. Being in this country,  and having had during a long life  much experience among my country- men, if I am allowed to make any  suggestion as to the means that  should be adopted inorder to secure  success here I would as one important  requisite mentioned that the Church  should found here in Jaffa, a  Centrum for their missionary work, a lot should be bought to sufficient  for the erection of a meeting house  or a school inorder that the  people might thereby be brought  into close contact with your people.  Without 
 Without a meeting place it is not  easy to reach the people, then if  possible a tract of land should be  procured large enough for establishing  a Colony of Saints. There are already  ^a^ few who express themselves as ready  for baptism and more would be  likely to follow when it become known  that the work of the Church was  really established here and the colo- nization would, I have no doubt,  in course of time not only be the  means of doing much spiritual  good but also more than pay its  expenses.  There are several reasons why  I suggest that Jaffa should be  the centrum for missionary work and why an eventual colony not  far from here.  Jaffa is the principal Port of  Jerusalem, Nablos (the capital  of Samaria) and Gaza the most  Southern City of Palestine and on the 
 the highway to Egypt. The Jews have  already several Colonies round about  here some of which cultivate yearly  vast tract of land with vines and  there is no doubt that the same will  secure for them in due time immense  profits. The number of pilgrims  which pass through here to Jerusalem amount to many thousands yearly.  Jaffa is a great mercantile place. From here is exported to England,  Russia, Austria, and Constantinople millions of Oranges in boxes of a hundred each of large size every  year. Formerly great quantities of  grain used also to be exported to  different part of Europe but of late  years owing to the great export from  America our export became insigni- ficant  Jaffa although like some Oriental  Cities almost utterly neglected by the  Municipal Authorities is one of  the most healthy places in the  Turkish Empire, meats, chickens, and vegetables can be procured at  any 
 any time of the year at reasonable  prices. The air outside the City  particularly in the South, is very  healthy. There is another point  which in my jugdgment would be  of great importance to a prosperous  mission work among the people  here. If you could by any means  help a few of the natives over to Utah  where they might find some work to do  and in the mean time receive  full instructions in the principles  of the Gospel, some of them might  by the help of God be of the greatest  use in spreading the light of truth  in the interior of the Country among  the Villagers working under the  direction of your own missionaries  from Utah. What an unspeakable  pleasure it would give me to see  some of these men return and  bring about a thorough conversion  of some so called Christians to  know the true God and seek  repentance as I have already 
 seen in a case of a native lady in whom I have observed such a  great change since the Visits of  Mr Sjodahl to her house and the  testimony he has born of the truth  of the Gospel. When I speak of  helping them over, "I do so, because  I know that without help they  cannot go.  Any assistance that I can lend  in the furtherance of this cause  I shall be glad to do  Please mention me very kindly  to the Apostles who are at home  and allow me to say that a few  lines from you in reply to this,  will be very much appreciated  Believe me to be  Yours most respectfully  M.

 Prest. Woodruff endorsed Bro. Mae- ser's remarks and commended his pray- erfulness as a worthy example for all  teachers in the Church Schools. He  referred to the tendency of the schools of the  land towards infidelity, and exhorted  the teachers to prepare themselves by  humility and prayerfulness to combat this  tendency by making our denominational  schools successful 
 Prest. Woodruff said whatever leads to good is of God, and if good, is to come from this direction all is good.  Satin [Satan] is on the alert and the practices spoken of are laying the foundation for evil to future generations.  The parents do not realize this is of importance to children.

 Constantinople July 6th 1892  President Wilford Woodruff Salt Lake City  Utah  My beloved Brother!  I am just in receipt of a letter from President Young in answer to one I wrote stateing that it  prehaps would be a good idea to leave this city for a season  and go in to the interior of Asia Minor whare our  saints are, and whare, as I understand it, there is  a greater chance of dooing good. Our saints, I urged, need  visiting and encourageing and besides I would have a  better chance of mastering the language. And again  there is an old sister in Haifa who is desireious  of helping the work of the Lord and has promiced to  pay to any one, authorized to receive the same, one thous- and franks to be used in the Turkish Mission  besides a years' tithing. But Prest Young is cautious  a bout accepting this money as the sister's children  are not members of the church and they might  raise some serious objections and, it may be, cause us some trouble. Since my letter I sugested  it would be a good idea to visit this sister and as- certain just how matters stand, and if it would  be unwise to accept the money we can explain  to the good sister, and on the other hand, if every  thing is all right we can receive the money. President Young thinks the idea a good one  and I have, therefore, decided to leave Constanti- nople in a few days. But before starting I thought  to pen you a few lines relative to the out look in  this part of the vineyard, and, at the same time,  to render an account of the funds sent here 
 to and in the furtherance of this righteous cause  would not be out of the way.  Long ere this, and, no doubt, with deep  regret, you have received Elder Herman's report of  our failure in accomplishing what at one time  seemed so certain. But as I dident arrive here  untill after Bro H's failure and as I dont know  what he reported I have nothing much to write  on this point. And as opinions are cheap it may  be wisdom for me to keep mine to myself, but  what I would like to say is this. That Elder Stauffer's  going home, as he did, just when success was  a bout to crown his labors and leaveing inexperienced  Elders, Elders unacquainted with the maners and  language of the people, was rather a mistake. And might I offer a suggestion. I would say  send an Elder to this mission every six months, so that in the future there will always be some  one here who can speak the language for before  we are acquainted with the language we can  accomplish nothing. I have great faith in the  Turkish people if we could only reach them and  I dont think the day is far distant when things  will be so changed that we can reach them  just as good as we can any other people and our labors will be attended with greater  success. Even now our Elders can go and come  just as they please and can preach just whare  and when they please, and I beleave the Government  will yet grant us the rights we are so anxious  to obtain. I dont think it would be wisdom to  try to do anything more regarding the publishing  at present. It would be better to wait untill next  year when I hope to be able to speak the language 
 and we can work more intelligently.  After learning that the Government had refused  us permission to publish our tracts in this lan- guage I decided to have some published any how  for I thought by useing discretion we could circulate  a few thousand a moung the people with whome we  came daily in contact with out running any un- due risk and, at the same time, keep the work al- ready begun slowly moveing a long untill such  time when we can enjoy more freedom. Accordingly I got questions from a Vienna house  and place a trial order for two thousand tracts printed  in the Armena Turkish language. The price, 8 1/2 pounds, I considered very expensive but it was the best  I could do. After placeing my order, I learned that  all second class mail was subject to examination  by Turkish officials and when found to contain  something the Government would not sanction  it was confiscated. Now the only ^way^ I could do was to  write and order our pamphlets sent by letter  postage at an extra cost of 5 1/2 pounds. This makes our tracts very expensive still I think the money  thus spent has been well invested.  The enclosed statement with a few explanations  will be easly understood. Prest Young said the mission  would pay my railroad fare from Berlin 3rd class but as the ride was 78 hours long I thought  I had better travle second class and I did so  paying the extra charges out of my own pocket 744.00 Ps being 3rd class. "Our necessary liveing expences" enclude what we have had to pay out for food. "Subscription to Osen Post." This a friendly German  news paper and I thought it policy to subscribe  for it and will charge the account to myself 
 if you think proper. "Cash paid to DCWM" is money  I have used myself mostly for cloths because after  my year in Germany my clothes were rather  baggy and I had to use mission money to get  more. As I am very desirerous of paying  my own way, for I dearly love to tell people  that the elders of Christ pay there own expenses, I intend to pay back every cent that I have borrowed  but my circumstances are such at present that  I will have to ask the mission to wait a while.  Now my dear Brother I would love to receive in- structions or suggestions from time to time  from the Presidency and I am ever anxious  to devote ^what^ strength I have to the spreading of God's  work here on earth. In the future I will try and  report our success to you every month if  you so desire.  Hopeing you will pardon this  letter and ever praying for Zion and the cause  of our Lord, I subscribe myself  Your brother  Don C. W. Musser  [sideways text] D. C. W.

 Uintah, Alleppo Feby, 17th 91  Pres. Wilford Woodruff and Consulars  P.O. Box B. Salt Lake City Utah.  Dear Brethern, Your in- teresting epistle of 10th ulto. was duly recived and contents noted with much pleasure. President Brigham Young had  preveoiously informed us that you had authorized him to assist us by sending some elders and also with means for the purpose of publishing tracts, etc, both of which are are much in need of to be successful in spreading the Gospel among these anxious, but benighted peple. In regards to the subject of procureing Government grant which will privilage us to preach and circulate tracts openly etc, I can give no reliable answere as to what it will cost and how it may be obtained, as that can only be learned at the capitol. I have, however, lately been informed of some points which may modify the ideas conveyed in my recent letters to Pres. Young concuring the matter. For some time the American Protestants exerted themselfves to stir up the people against us and to accuse us before the government to the end that they might banish, or otherwise get rid of us, but as they did not succeede in getting the other Christian sects to join them in their false accusation (which was neccessary to take effect,) they had to drop their plan, and thus we are left at liberty to continue our labors as before. The point I wish to make is this, that all the different Protestant sects work on one  government grant, which is possessed by the English Epis- copal Church. This grant privileges all Non-Catholic 
 Churches to proselyte throughout the Ottomen Empire,  previding they can make such arrangements with the Episcopal Church, which holds the grant. This, then, is one way for pocureing a right to poselyte in Turkey. To obtain a grant directly from the government (from what I learn) will require considerable means (the am't cannot be asertained un- til the task is undertaken, as bribery is the common law.) The priveleges of a grant are effectual throughout the empire so far as preaching is concurned, but special grants are required for building churches or school: hence I conclude that for  colononizing ^also^ seperate grant would be required. As for publish- tracts, I learn that all that is necessary is to make arrange- ments with some printer, who, if there be nothing to interfere with Turkish politics, receives the right for printting and distributing (tracts) may then be done without any danger of trouble as far a the government is concurned, unless stired up by Christians. This printing also can only be attended to in Constantinople...  We are pleased that our suggestions in regards to  calling local brethern in to the ministry, were favorably accept- ed. There are several good faithful brethern who are becomming well informed in the principles of the Gospel. To have one of them accompany each of the Utah elders will certainly prove a great help. There is indeed a great field of labor before  us in this land and therefore room for a good number of elders The people in many places are anxiously awaiting the arrival of some "Mormon" elders, to teach them in the ways of life. 
 Since my arrival in this place our numbers have been steadi- ly increasing. Have added eleven members to the Church by baptism and there are prospects for many more. We are quite regularly organized. Hold two meetings on each Sabath at my room, and two during the week which are quite well at- tended. On Thursday Feby. 5th, we held our first Fast meeting Most of the Saints were presant and brought their offerings. They pay a tithe of all their earnings weekly or monthly as the case may be. There is a good feeling generally among us and thus we hope to be able to teach by example as well as by pre- cept. ...Though none of the saints here are wealthy, they are all industrious and as yet only one has been in need of a little assistence. It is strange to say that all of our members in this branch are males and most of them heads of families. We have no poper place to receive dladies at our meetings, owing to the necessity of two seperate departments for males and females to conform to the customs of the Orient. We are often envited out to teach at evenings which is the only opertunity offorded for ladies to hear our teaching (probably lady missionaries could do much good.)  The saints in other branches of this mission were all feeling well when I heard from them last. For a while the "Cholera" was the  cause of much sorrow in these parts; but now good health pevales generally. The saints join me in sending greeting to you and the Church in general.

 #833 7th St Louisville Feby. 28 [18]92  President, Woodruff & Counselors,  Dear Breothern, I have just received a long letter  from our friend and brother Binyad from Constantinople, the substance of which is that he has succeeded in getting  rights for our church, that is the  Sublime Porte has ruled that our  appeal for liberty to worship and  preaching the Gospel is in accordance  with there laws and that the efforts  of the Christian sects in opposing  us were unconstitutional. He says  that the cost of court and making out the Charter are about $2575 00/100 i. e.  6500 piasters, which must be paid, then  they can have as much printing done  as they please, and have a representative  at the Porte who will be paid from  the Government. The right for building  any house of worship would have 
 to be procured separatly. This charter  will alow the cChurch to proselyte  and distribute printed matter any- where in the empire. I suppose that  Bro Schoenfeld has written you of  the matter. Bro. Binyad has worked  very faithfully for nearly a year without  any pay, nor does he require anything  for his labor. He requested me to try to  get some one to make him a lone of  about four or five hundred dollars  which he will return with interest  in a few months after receipt. He has  had a law suit with his uncles  for about ($25000-00/100) twenty five thousand  dollars, which was decided in his favor  by the Supreme courte after fighting  it for seven or eight years. Now it  requires about four or five hundred  dollars to get a settlement. He is a  charatiable fellow and I firmly believe  that he will do much to help the 
 cChurch financially if he can but  be assisted a little. Many of his  aquaintences there would loan him  money but for his religeous vi^e^ws. If you can do any thing for him  I believe it would be safe and  and also a great help to him.  I know of nothing further to write  you con curning the matter, but as  I have had something to do with work  there and still have the interest of the  Orientals at herart, I felt it my duty  to make the above statements.  Am getting along nicely with my  study of medecine,  I Am as ever  Your Bro. in the cause of Truth Fred. Stauffer

 Constantinople,  January 25th 1892.  To the First Presidency,  Salt Lake City,  Dear brothern,  Enclosed please find the receipt for  the $30000 Which you have appropriated for the  Turkish Mission, and accept my thanks for the  same, and I shall use it for the purposes mentioned  in Elder F. Stauffers letter, to the best of my  Judgment and understanding. Our case is still  pending in the Sultans Court, and I think it  will be decided now in a few days, and I shall  let you know with pleasure, when we have received a  definite answere, wheather we have gained the object  we have sought for, or not. I feel well spiritualey,  and feel like filling the call made upon me to the  best of my abileity, the only complaint I have at  present is my health. The Climate dose not seem  to agree with me very well. My lungs are very  weak and sore, but I hope to feel better in the  future. Please accept my best regards, and I remain  as ever your true and humble servant, and brother  in the faith.  Joseph F. Schoenfeld. 
 Jos F. Schoenfeld  25 Jan. 1892 
 Jos. F. Schoenfeld Albert Herman. Constantinople: January 27th 1892  To the First Presidency: Salt Lake City.  Dear brothern,  Yesterday we had a  thorough investigation by the aid of  an Interpreter how Bro. Binyad, is  proceeding with our case. In obtaining  a charter, and the right to print in the Turkish language our Church  works, so we have learned the  following. That he must have im- mediately Three Pounds: which we gave  him, to pay for the translation of the  Book of Mormon, and the Doc. & Cov. Which he says had to done in  order that the Turks could under- stand what our religion consisted of. 
 And last Saturday he says that  they gave the decision in our favor  to teach our religion, and print our  Church works in the Ottomane Empire. But now to obtain the papers and  to go through all the ceremonies of  recording them will require Sixty  five (65) Pounds more. Makeing a  totale sum of Sixty eight (68) Pounds. Which he says will finish the work. But now the question arises what  we shall do? The three hundred  dollors which you have sent for the  Mission is equivolent to Sixty six-42/100 66-42/100 Turkish Pounds makeing  nearly tow (2) Pounds short of the  sixty eight. (68) which we need to  obtain the Charter. Say nothing  about the ten pounds for Bro Binyads services. And the amount 
 what will be required to have the  printing done, and what it will take  for bakh-sheesh, which is demanded  by the Turks. So takeing every thing  into consideration, to gather with  unforseen changes, which might take  place in the Turkish Administration,  for you never can tell what a thing  is going to cost here, when its started  untill it is finished, And then to  have a little on hand to sustain  some local Elders, as Bro. Stauffers letter says, whom we might call into  the Ministrey after we have obtained  the rights, will require nothing short  of 20000 or 25000 Dollars more, so we have left the matter at  present, with the understanding  that we would write to you for  further information concerning 
 this case. Bro. Binyad, has also written to Bro. Stauffer stateing  how the affair stands at present. And we will wait anxiously  for an answere from you, at your  earliest convenience. Dear brothern, I am sorry that I must inform you  that on account of my continueal ill health, Prest. Young did not  think it wise for me to remain here. So he has transferred me to Switzer- land. So you may address your  letter of instructions to Bro. A Herman. This is about all we have  to say at present. Hopeing it will  meet your approveal, please accept  our kindest regards, And we  remain as ever Your brothern in the faith,  Joseph F. Schoenfeld. Albert Herman. 
 W. H. Smart 20 May 1890. (Recd. 23 May).  Logan, May, 20 [18]90.  Pres. Wilford Woodruff:  Dear Brother:  Please find en- closed a letter from an Armenian Bro. George A. Vezirian of Aintab, Turkey. I thought it might be interesting to you to read a communica- tion from that land.  This Bro. is one of the few whom I met there who seemed honest in spirital matters. He la- bored zealously, during our stay in Aintab, as an interpreter of the prin- 
 ciples of the gospel which we explained to him. His written sentiments, I am pleased, reflect still sincerily, and a de- sire to be useful in bringing about salvation to souls.  He touches upon points out of my juris- diction to answer, and as he is alone in a far off land, I thought it advisable to send you his letter so that, should you deem it necessary, you could or- der a letter written him.  Your humble servant in the gospel of Christ:  W. H. Smart.

 521 1/2 6th Street  San Francisco Nov 21, 1893  Prest. W. Woodruff & Councilors,  Dear Brethren: Lasst Thurs- day the 16th inst. I baptized Seven, Two new,  one rebaptism & 4 children. Please answer the  following question.  Josiah Watson, joined our Church, Was  ordained an Elder. His health was very  poor, the Dr told him to go to California  he did so. After he got here he joined  the Josephites. After joining them he be- gan to Study the Doctrin & Covenants, became  dissatisfied with them. He hunted me up  I talked to him. He was convinced that he  was wrong, and decided to come back. He was  not cut off the Church. Question is his  a new baptism, or a renewal of covenants?  If the latter does he Still hold the Priesthood? My descission was a new baptism and  of course if he lost his membership he  lost his Priesthood.  We hold meetings 11 a m & 7 p m on  Sundays & at 7 p. m. Thursdays. We have  Sunday School at 10 a. m. Sundays  Our meetings are fairly well attended, a  number of strangers are reading our 
 of the Lord has followed our administra- tion. So we feel that we are greatly blessed  by our Heavenly Father.  I need more Elders, I need some  good experienced ones, and they must be  men with sufficient means to support  themselves, I want you to send me  more Elders. There are 56 large counties  in this State, without going into Oregon,  I want to devide the State up into con- ferences, with from Six to ten traveling  Elders, and a conference President in each  conference, So I can do very well with a  good live, energetic, experienced, Elder with plenty of means to Preside over  each conference, for he can (if he has means  so he can travel) get around among the  Elders and Show them how it is done. I  need at least five more Elders for the  external Southern part of the State at once.  Our financial condition here is not as  good as I would like it. I have not been  able to visit to the Elders going to lack of  means. I will give you a brief account of  our circumstances. While in prosperity  in Ogden I was trying to place money so 
 that the dividends would be ample for the  Support of my family's at home and to help  me on my mission, for as soon as I had  accomplished this I intended to report my- self ready for I love to work in the  ministry where-ever the Sevan Servants  of God Say to go. I secured stock &  it was fully paid up, in Z. C. M. I., First  National Bank, of Ogden, and the U. L. & T. Co. Bank of Ogden So that the dividends brought  me anualy $676. It felt that this was hardly  enough, So I invested in the Mercantile bus- iness, with brethren that I had confidence in  to do this I had to borrow money. Well owing  to the missmanagement, of others & dull times  coming on, I lost it all about $15000. And  Some debts still not paid. I feel know it was  a loss but I think that it was robery  under the cover of law, and not only did  the money go but my name also, but I  feel to say in the language of Job, The  Lord giveth & the Lord taketh away and  blessed be the name of the Lord. The  result is I have no income for myself ^& family^ here nor my family at home.  I hope you will not think that I write  thus by way of complaint, but that you may 
 {shorthand}  521 1/2 6th Street San Francisco Cal. Oct 6th 1893  Presidents Woodruff and Smith  Dear Brethren: Yours of Sept 30th to hand. In reply will say, that I was not aware that Brother Cummings had written to Bishop Preston untill I got your letter.  Although you failed to find any record of a letter sent me giving me instructions about the disposition of the tithing, I received the letter all right, dated March 20 1893 & Signed Geo Reynolds Sec, which reads  as follows: "Replying to your favor of the 15th inst. I am instructed to say that no Tithing or Temple Donations Should be read by any member of the Priesthood into whose hands it is paid except on an order from the trustee in Trust or the Presiding Bishop; and a record should be kept in each mission, in which all the tithing paid should be recorded."  I will be as brief as I can and explain what I have done.  On March 5 1893 I wrote Prest. Seymour B. Young, and ask permission to use the tithing that might be paid by the saints; 
 ^know^ the condition of things.  The Lord softened and opened the heart of  Bro. (Dr) VanDerBergh. So that we have a shelter  over our heads and a hall to hold meetings in  free of rent, which has made it possable for  us to stay and open a mission here, otherwise  we could not have done it but how long the  Drs heart will remain open I don t know  for he is a very queer man. I must not  omit to mention Bro. Seymour B. Young  who has sent me $130, So that we have  been able to nearly live, when I say  nearly I mean that we found friends  here. We are owing Some here yet.  I never felt better in the Gospel in my  life. And I am Satasfied that a good work  can be done here. As I Said I can begin  to See a little of the result of our labors and I want to continue laboring in the  cause of Christ.  Please send me more Elders right ay  away. I learn that there are Saints enough  in Los Angeles for a branch organization  and as I have not the means to go there I want a  good Elder to send there to preside so that he can  attend to it. Kind regards to all. Your brother  J. L. Dalton 
 at the time I wrote Sister Dalton was living at Bro. James T. Garlick's in Sacramento, I ask Bro Young if it would be right for me to credit Bro. Garlick on tithing, for keeping my wife. hHe answered me yes ^to both questions.^ And he added that I was to keep a record as you say in your letter, should be done, all of which I have done, Bro. Young letter bears date 15 March 1893. A few days later I received Bro Geo. Reynolds' letter lrefered to above dated 20 March 1893. On March 31st I sent a ^ful detailed^ report of all tithing & Temple Donation, to Bro. Young, with a request that an appropriation be made for the amount ($41.20/100) for the benefit of the California Mission. All the Temple donations I have received I sent the money to Bishop Preston & hold his receipt for the same. This $41 20/100 includes $10. I credited Bro Garlick with for my wife staying with them one month. I  credited Bro. Garlick, on april 7 1893 an other $10. for my wife; This is all the tithing I have received up to date. I have received mission fund from the Saints here since August 22nd 1892, the sum of $51 25/100 I have also received a little money from visiting members of the church. 
 J. S. Dalton Nov. 21 [18]93. 
 I received a letter from Pres. S. B. Young acknowledging the receipt of the report of the tithing but he did not say whether an appropriation had been made of the amount for this mission or not. If the appropriation has not been made, I would be pleased if you would make it so that all may be kept straight. That there may be no mistake I send you the report again. This is a copy of the report sent to Bro. Young.          Nov 20, ^1892^ J. P. Jorgensen,  Fruitval Alameda co. Cal.

 Richfield Severe County July 25 [18]87  Dear Brother & Sister Cottam While Brother Wm is writing to Emma, I will try to scratch a few lines to you. As Brother Wm Has given a full listing about our team and colts to Emma I will say nothing about that ownly it was like leaving a couple of children to leave those two poor Little colts but we could not travel any Longer with them and it was a Marvel that we got them as far as we did But there is a good old Danish Grand Mother who will give them green Lucern Every day and I think they would do better than they would to travel. I am as Well as usual ownly I get very weary come night in riding all day. We [have felt] anxious to hear from Sister Cottam to know how she was doing. We learn that president Taylor is still Living but very Low I expect we will be in Salt lake County in 4 or 5 days if all is Well We have not Been in a situation to write while on the road before while we camped on Fish Creek for 24 [hours] to doctor the colts & give them rest. I went to fishing I caught 54 trout small ones so we had a plenty of fish to Eat I would be very glad to come in & spend a night with you and see how you are getting along please give my Love to Amelia George & Thomas & families And Ask Thomas if He is fulfilling the mission I gave him I dont want him to Neglect that for He that is faithful  [last line cut off]
