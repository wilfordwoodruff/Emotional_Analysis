Br Solomon Hancock went  out in the morning on to the bluffs to kill buffalo on foot He did not come in at night we felt concerned about him early in the morning he came in, had killed a 3 year old cow &amp; watched it over night to keep the volves from eating it  3 wolves came upon him he shot one the rest run  away this made 12 buffalo in all that the hunters  killed to day which we considered was doing vary well  considering that we were nearly all strangers to that mode  of hunting as but vary few of us ever saw a wild  buffalo before in our lives we dressed out meat &amp; waggons  came from camp to take it in.

Another company was formed to go &amp; explore out  the rout &amp; see if we could get grass for our horses as the  Indians had been burning it up for several days. We went  into the bluffs &amp; seperated into two Parties 10 in each  &amp; we travled some 10 miles back &amp; &amp; forth over the hills &amp; saw no game except antelope &amp; wolves unwell I concluded to go back to camp. A Lyman &amp;  3 others were with me. we set down upon the edge of the bluff in sight of the camp to rest ourselves &amp; we  saw a company of 20 horsman approaching ^us^ from the camp in haste bearing a red flag when they got within  half a mile of us we trailed our arms &amp; went down to meet them. they informed us that the party that  went up the river had come upon an encampment  of about 400 Indian warriors. A party of about 100  had followed them down a ravene to cut off their  retreat probably with the Intention of robbing them of their horses &amp; clothing &amp; would take life if they could not do it with out &amp; this company of horsman  had come to us to call in the hunters to camp so  we went in the hunters in coming in with the horsman came across a herd of buffalo &amp; brought into camp 3 calf, &amp; 4 antelope they kept out a good guard during the night &amp; we had no disturbance the  cannon was fired twice early in the morning to let  the Indians know we were awake.

He info- rmed us they were traders from fort Laramee he had been  there 3 years had not tasted bread for 2 years, was 16 days from Laramee the grass was green &amp; good on the south side to that fort but burnt of on the North side He waided the Platt to come to us a mile across it &amp; did not go but little above his  knees He would take letters to us to Sarpee who lived near  winter Quarters so the camp our familys I was ahead of the company with O Pratt taking observations &amp; did not know untill the time was nearly up I then in great haste scribbled a few lines to my wife An epistle  was written to the Church &amp;c. Three Brethren accompanied the  Frenchman accross the Platt to the other men was 9 in all had not seen an Indian since they left Laramee, stated their was a ferry at the fort &amp;c agreed to take our letters safe we drove on 3 miles more &amp; bated our teams untill the Brethren  returned they made a report to the camp of what was  said to them a Council of the whole camp was then called  to deside whether we would cross the Platt or continue up   ENDENTRY  be better for us as a company to cross the river on  old travled road to Laramee as their was good grass on  the way on that side while the Indians were burning  it all off on the North side of the river where we were  travling but when we took into consideration the  situation of the next company &amp; thousands that would  follow after &amp; as we were the Pioneers &amp; had not our  wives &amp; children with us we thought it best to keep on  the north side of the river &amp; brave the difficulties of  burning Prairies &amp; make a road that should stand as  a permanant rout for the Saints indipendant of the  old emigration rout &amp; let the river seperate the emigrating  companies that they need not quarrel for wood grass  or water &amp; when our next company came along the grass  would be much better for them than it would on the south side as it would grow up by the time they would get  along. A vote was called &amp; it was unanimous to go on  the north side of the river. So the camp again moved  on, but during the nooning Col Markham drilled the men  in a military capacity, they unshiped the cannon &amp; carried it on wheels, the Frenchman informed us that he never  saw so many buffalo  stop several times to let the herd pass so they could get  along, we saw many deer &amp; antelope to day &amp; also wolves  and a few buffalo one large bull came across the river to us, we rode onto the bank before him &amp; he run  clear back again upon a loap &amp; again crossed below us we camped at night at a gravel creek or slew a large  herd of buffalo lay but a short distance before us we travled in all to day 9     ENDENTRY May 5, 1847    salt to fresh meat is affecting a number in camp The 400 Indian warriors that was supposed to be seen  on the 3 at a herd of antelope &amp; supposed them to be Indians we had to keep a guard out this morning to keep a herd of buffalo from mixing up with our cattle we have had vary strong south wind for 2 days, two buffalo bulls at noon were approaching the  herd of cows &amp; men went out &amp; drove them off  we rode up within 3 rods of one that was asleep &amp; stoped &amp; looked at him for some minutes he awoke &amp;  shook himself &amp; loaped off we met a large herd in the afternoon the Brethren killed one cow 5 calves &amp; brought a bull calf into camp a live with the intention of raising it, it would drink  water out of a pail they had some sport in tr to make it suckle a cow it would try hard to bunt  the men &amp; dogs over &amp; some got hard raps I have  been obliged to keep my bed a part of the day have suffered much with bowel complaint, when we  stoped for night we soon found ourselves in the midst of grass on fire &amp; had to return back   ENDENTRY  of the river that was just burned over &amp; no feed  except small patches some took there horses on an Island near &amp; cut down cotton wood for them we travled to day 15     ENDENTRY May 6, 1847    night I had a poor nights rest. we started early this  morning without feeding (except a little corn) as there was no grass &amp; travled 3 miles &amp; got beyond the fire left it in our  rear &amp; stop to bait &amp; breakfast on a good spot of grass, this  morning the herds of buffalo speck the plains on both sides  of the river and antelope in great abundance some of  which run into camp, the buffalo calf is dead this morning that was brought into camp alive last night we continued our journey saw many herds of buffalo antelope &amp; one large  herd of elk a young buffalo clalf came into camp &amp; followed us we gave him some milk &amp; left him we travled 10 miles  &amp; nooned on the prairie. we scarsly meet with any timber  now, two antelope were killed this forenoon but as we have  so much meet in camp it is thought best not to kill any more buffalo untill we need it or any other game. we were visited at noon with many buffalo Dr G.

Br Kimball remarked that he had herd many buffalo tales told but he never expe- cted to behold what his eyes now saw the half had not been  told him we saw many dead scattered about &amp; many  wolves following the herds, when we stoped at noon many of  them walked along by the side of our waggons so that  we might easily have shot them down, O P Rockwell did  shoot one through the neck &amp; she droped dead it was a  two year old heifer &amp; good meet there were a great number  of calves &amp; young cattle in the herds we saw to day we  had great difficulty in keeping our cattle &amp; horses from going  among them for if they once get mixed with a herd  it is almost impossible to ever get them again. we  travled to day untill we came to the bluffs that made  down to the river &amp; camped for the night distance 11 1/4     us &amp; took a survey of the surrounding country with our  glasses there being present B.

I found on the bluff their  medicine bag tied to a stick 6 feet long stuck up in the  bank it was what is called kinikinnick composed of  tobacco &amp; bark to smoke I also found a saddle tied to a large  buffalo dung I supposed to show the next party which  way the buffalo had gone I left my horse in the valley  to feed while I went onto a bluff to see the country &amp;  he started off not seeing the camp took the back tract   ENDENTRY  I run through the great Soux encampmen whare  they had had there lodges while on their hunt I left  my gun there &amp; followed my horse untill I overtook  him with the assistance of Br Fowler who came out from  the encampment &amp; stoped him I then rode back got  my gun examined the ground &amp; should judge their  had been 500 lodges there was acres of ground covered  with buffalo wool whare they had dressed there skins they left much stuff scattered over the ground such  as peaces of dressed buffalo &amp; mogascins  &amp;c I brought in a good dressed white wolf skin distance of the day 12 mil    about 10 miles above us the bluffs that I passed over  to day were more fertile &amp; covered with more grass  than any I had seen on the Platt before a young  buffalo was killed &amp; brought in in the evening    ENDENTRY May 13, 1847    encampment &amp; brought in mogasens, parts of robes  leather &amp;c, we have a strong cold north wind to  day, we travled to day 11 miles &amp; camped on the  west bank of a stream about 12 rods wide with  good ford that empties into the Platt this is nearly  opposite the first bluff that is formed between  the two forks of the Platt, the grass was better than  it had had been, the bluff here for the first time  on the north fork comes hold to the river so that  we have to go over the bluffs with our waggons there is one thing concerning the Platt river which  is worthy of note, which is not characteristic of any  other river that I have any knowledge of in the world it is much of the way a  coverd with water but vary shallow when a South  wind blows hard the water all rushes to the north  shore untill one would suppose there was a great rise  in the water let the wind shift &amp; b the North &amp; the wat shore untill one can walk across two thirds of the  river on bare ground &amp; the river constantly ebs &amp;  flows like the tide just according as the wind blows I went onto the bluffs hunting buffalo in the evening saw  several small herds President Young gave the stream  we camped on the name of the bluff fork.    whare we were to build up a stake of Zion. As we came  unto the place there was an open temple  presented before me I asked some brethren that stood  by me If they saw it they said they did not I gazed  upon it &amp; it was glorious it appeared as though it was  built of white &amp; blue stone the sight of it filled me  with Joy and I awoke, &amp; behold it was a dream 11 m   ENDENTRY May 14, 1847    buffalo I cashed myself in the bank &amp; a large herd  came along, but their old bulls was out as a rear &amp;  front guard &amp; there was none of their young cattle  near enough for me to shoo some more coming I way laid them they proved to  be 7 bulls I fired at the youngest one while he passed by but missed him I then returned to camp took breakfast had a hard shower of rain &amp; some words  with Br Higby  soon Killed an antelope that was put on board  of a boat called the revenue cutter Phineas Young &amp; myself went out together waited for buffalo &amp;  antilope I finally got lost among the bluff, but  found my way out again Br Phineas shot an buck antilope &amp; I carried him into camp there was 3 antilope &amp; one buffalo bull killed. some of the  hunters thought they herd Indian guns on the opposit side of the river during the night an Indian cralled up to a pair of mules that was tied together &amp; made a grab to ketch them they sprung &amp; got  away from him one of the guards shot at him &amp; he run all horses  were then brought into the circle &amp; the cannon prepared for firing but seeing no more it was not fired travled 8     ENDENTRY May 15, 1847    about 3 miles &amp; camped in the best grass we had found on  the road, most of our road this morning was over &amp; through the bluffs as they come again bold to the river a large number of  barefoot tracks was seen this morning under the bluff on the bank of the river, supposed to be the Indians that came down  last night to steal our horses, the rain stoped in the afternoon  &amp; we drove 5 miles &amp; camped on the prairie. distance 8 miles we saw the bluffs dotted over with buffalo I went out with  some others to hunt them I could not get within about 30  rods of them I shot at the neck of one &amp; the ball went into his  sholdier which crippled him but he hobbled away with  the herd &amp; I did not get him but there were a number  of hunters among the herds &amp; one of them killed a fat  buffalo which was brought into camp. the bluffs again come  down to the river a short distance before us    ENDENTRY May 16, 1847    well this morning and did not rise untill 7 oclok which was  two hours after the time when I got out of my carriage  I found all five of my horses standing at the stakes while all the other horses of the encampment had been feeding  two hours. It was Br John Fowlers business to let them out but he did not get up untill half an hour after I did. He Is destitute of the spirit or principle that a faithf- ul man or servant should possess and it makes it  much harder upon me in the care of the teams &amp;  business than it would if I had a true &amp; faithful man with me Br Burnham does our cooking which  keeps him vary busy &amp; he has the hardest time of it as much of the time he has nothing but buffalo dung   ENDENTRY  proving ourselves &amp; if we are not faithful we shall come under condemnation. I rode out to day with Brothers Young  Rockwell &amp; Stephens 4 miles over the bluffs to pick out a road for the camp to go across to get again on the bottoms we found a road through &amp; returned to the  camp I picked up a young hare which Br Young took in to  camp, we saw herds of buffalo while coming in.

He spoke vary sharply upon the indiferance of men, &amp; they  rejected the meet when it was brought into camp &amp;c the camp started out after the meet was disposed of &amp; the hunters or horsman went forward to pick out the  road instead of going hunting I did not hear a gun fired on the road during the day Amasa Lyman was one called  by name &amp; reproved for not paying any attention to seeking  out the road, but he was with us to day in that business we rode 6 miles &amp;  9 3/4 miles &amp; camped for the night distance of the day 15 3/4    ENDENTRY May 19, 1847    mile that we have crossed on the journey &amp; what made it still  worse the rain was pouring down upon us continually we travled  about 1/2 mile on the flat &amp; camped untill the rain was over for  the time being we started again at 3  again hard we travled untill 5  of the river we travled 8 miles by the wheelometer 8 miles    we had the most water fall during the day and evening that we  have met with on the whole journey    ENDENTRY May 20, 1847    side of the Ash Creek that comes through the  bluffs to the Platt on the south side of the river whare the Origon road first strikes the north fork of the Platt several  of the brethren went over in a boat that we were taking with  us &amp; ex with some ash. rock, wild curands &amp; cherry &amp;c we came on 8 3/4 miles &amp; camped for the night we crossed a large  creek about 12 rods across it which we supposed it to be  a creek that Glos Cload called the Rawhiyde we had a vary good road most of the day on the bank of the  River, we have passed a good deal of rock bluff on both  sides of the river, &amp; some on the south side of the river  was formed into natural terrices, rotundas, squairs &amp;c 50  or 100 feet high looked like forts &amp; fortications &amp; strong holds upon they resemble  the work of art &amp; look some like the old castles of Scotland they were level on the top.

But he was well satisfyed  with himself, his brethren the Twelve &amp; the camp at large one  thing he would say to the praise of all, that was not one  had refused to obey his council on the road. His peace with  God was continually like a river &amp; he felt that the spirit of  peace rested upon the whole camp. many good things were  said. Several other brethren followed him after which  meeting was dismissed. we intended to have rode out in the  evening, but we saw that a storm was gathering, &amp; it soon  began to blow vary hard about as much as we could do to  save our waggons bows &amp; covers from being smashed   ENDENTRY  raining  it turned vary cold I had fears that some of our horses would  perish with the cold as such changes were freequent in this  region Mr Sarpee related a circumstance that transpired sev eral years since at about this place on the 22nd of May one  day earlier than this while travling down this fork of the platt it was warm weather the grass 10  some in the afternoon &amp; turned cold in the evening &amp; before  morning 16 of his best horses were frozen to death by the side  of the waggons &amp; his  the changes are vary great in this country &amp; when I see it  turning so cold I coverd all my horses with blankets that  I cou It rained occasionally in the night. the horses shook with  cold but morning came &amp; all was alive as soon as they were  let loose they run to warm themselves.

Chimney rock still grows plainer to our view we drove in the afternoon 6 1/2 miles &amp; camped near the quick  sand mountain that run in a ridge from the river back that  apparently had been heaped up by the wind I rode about  two miles forward to find grass and a camping place and on  my return I saw about 30 Soux Indians Plunge their horses  Into the River on the opposite side &amp; make towards us I rode  with several others to the river &amp; met them as they came  out they shook hands with us, vary friendly, the Chief  unfurled a large American Flag with the Eagle stars &amp; stripes  &amp; presented me a Letter.

The hunters brought in four Antelope we passed much good grass to day. I rode to day with Br Kimball  &amp; Benson to look out the road I have during the last two days  read Mr Calafornia. He has  greatly exhagerated the account of upper Calafornia.    an accurance took place which liked to have proven of serious consequence to our camp. An Indian Horse that was bought of the Sioux ran away with a  endious fright to the cows, oxen &amp; horses that were attached to the waggons and in an instant a dozen or more waggons  were darting by each other like lightning &amp; the horses &amp; mules  flying as it were over the ground some turned to the right &amp;  some to the left some run into other waggons, the horse &amp; mule  that Br Fowler was driving leaped with all spead, with Br Little hold of the lines &amp; Br Fowler hold of the bits they darted  by my carriage like electricity &amp; came within one inch of a  collission with my wheels if they had locked we should have  been a wreck another waggon followed by in the same manner  with a pair of Mules &amp; one yoke of cattle upon a keen run which  would also have smashed my carriage if they had hit it but  my own horses by this time started to run but was soon held up by the driver, Br Fowlers waggon continued to ro regardless of rough or smooth ground for about fifty rods &amp;  he draged the whole distance by the bit which was the  case with many others, but all was soon stoped &amp; returned  to there lines without any accident to any team or waggon  which appeared to me truly a miricle William Smoots team run away also with great speed. It give us sumthing of an  Idea what an Indian yell  ment with teams hitched to waggons. A person can hardly  concieve of the power that is manifest in animals esspecially mules when in such a fright. But I felt thankful that no  accident happened.    by the Sexton Professor Pratt made the Chimney rock to be 260 feet above the level of the river. distance of the day 12 1/2     ENDENTRY May 27, 1847    &amp; nooned in good grass Br Kimball &amp; myself picked the road in the foornoon &amp; it was left to me in the afternoon &amp; I piloted the road in the afternoon as strait as any road that had been  made on the whole rout &amp; picked out a camping ground on  the bank of the river in good feed we travled 5 3/4 miles 13 3/4    the House of Israel to travel in for many years to come therefore it requires the greater care. The hunters brought in 5 Antilope to day. we camped at half past 4 oclock opposite Scotts Bluff at Lattitude 41º, 50', 52." the wedth  of the river 772 yards a wind soon arose accompanied by  thunder &amp; lightning we had but little rain.   ENDENTRY May 28, 1847    untill it stop raining. so we started at 10  miles &amp; camped for the night on the bank of the river it was a damp cold day we passed alongside of a clear strem of water with some  beaver dams &amp; houses upon it at one place it raised the water about  two feet which was lined with fish a good share of which was  speckled trout so the brethren informed me this is the first strea- m I have met with containing trout since I left the New  England States. Therefore I name it trout creek it was not more  than 3 miles long it arose from a large pure spring. it was but a little  above Scotts Bluffs FIGURE distance of the day 11 1/2    several of the brethering playing dominoes in a waggon near by began to teach by saying that the devil was getting power over  the camp that for several days past nearly the whole camp had  drank into a spirit of card, checker, &amp; domino playing &amp; dancing  &amp; the spirit of folley &amp; if they did not spedily repent their  works, labours, &amp; journey would be in vain that we should  not accomplish the object for which we had come but should be thwarted in it. He said the Camp did not quarel any to be  shure for the devel would not set them to quarreling as long  as he could draw them away gradually from duty &amp; fill them with nonsens &amp; folley, for the devil was vary cuning in dra- wing away the people of God. I felt the force of his remarks &amp; thought them necessary. during the evening I went in to  the doctors waggon, read a chapter in the Book of Mormon &amp; prayed with them. After which B Young H. C. Kimball  E. T. Benson &amp; W. Woodruff met in council  in Br Youngs waggon &amp; Br Young wrote some of the word of the Lord concerning the camp &amp; expressed  his views &amp; feelings concerning the camp that they must  spedily repent or they would be cursed, that they were  forgetting their mission &amp; he had rather travel with  10 righteous men who would keep the commandments of God than the whole camp while in a carless manner &amp; forgetting God, we stayed untill 10  rest    ENDENTRY May 29, 1847    to gather up the horses &amp; cattle which took more than an hours  after which President Young called the camp together and required each Captain to seperate or calle out his men &amp; when  it was found all was present except two who had gone a  hunting he then addressed them, sumthing in the following language, I think I will take for my text to preach my sermon from, I am about to revolt from travling with this camp any further with the spirit they now possess, I had rather  risk myself among the savages with ten men that are men  of faith, men of mighty prayer men of God, than to be with this whole camp when they forget God &amp; turn there hearts  to folley &amp; wickedness, yea I had rather be alone, &amp; I am  now resolved not to go any further with the camp unless  you will covenant to humble yourselves before the Lord &amp;  serve him &amp; quit your folley &amp; wickedness, for a week past nearly the whole camp has been card playing, chequres &amp; dominnoes, have occupied the attention of the brethren   ENDENTRY  continually, now it is quite time to quit it, &amp; there has been  trials &amp; law suits upon evry nonsensical thing &amp; if these things  are suffered to go on it will be but a short time befor you  will be fighting knocking each other down &amp; taking life  &amp; it is high time it was stoped, I do not want to hear any  more such report meeting &amp; preaching to the rest after he had played cards  untill meeting time, you are a putty set of men going  to seek out a location among the mountains for a resting place of the Saints, even the whole Church of God who have been driven out from the gentiles &amp; rejected of them and after  you have esstablished a location you are then going out to preah  the gospel, seal salvation upon the House of Israel, &amp; gather  the nations. How would you look if they should know your  conduct &amp; ask you what did you do when you went to  seek out Zion, &amp; find a resting place for the Saints whare  the Standard of the Kingdom of  banners unfurled for the nations to gather unto, dut you  spend a good deal of your time in dancing pitching quarel, Jumping wrastleing &amp;c yes, yes, did you play cards, dice  checkers &amp; dominoes O! yes, what could you do with you- rself, why you would shrink from the glance of the  of God Angels &amp; men even wicked men, then are you  not ashamed of yourselves for practicing these things yes you are &amp; you must quit it. After speaking sumwhat  lengthy upon these matters he called the Twelve together  the High priest, Seventies &amp; Elders, &amp; found to be 8  of the quorum of the Twelve. 18 High Priest. 80 Seventies  &amp; 8 Elders after which President Young said unto the  Twelve If you are willing to humble yourselves before  the Lord &amp; covenant to do right &amp; walk humble before  him, make it manifest by raising the right hand when each one raised their hand, the same question  was put to the High Priest, Seventies, Elders &amp; Members  &amp; all universally covenanted with uplifted hand to humble  themselves before the Lord repent of their sins &amp; keep  his commandments. President Young then spoke of those  who was not in the Church as there were sum present that  they would be protected in their rights but they must  not introduce wickedness in the Camp for it would not  be sufferd. He then spoke of the standard &amp; ensign that  would be reared in Zion, to govern the Kingdom of God  FIGURE and the nations of the earth for evry nation  would bow the knea &amp; evry tongue confess that  JESUS was the Christ and this will be the  standard. The Kingdom of God &amp; his Laws &amp; Judgment in  {the hands of his servants Ahman Christ} And on the standard would be a flag  of evry nation under heaven so their would be an invitation to all  Nations under heaven to come unto Zion, the Saints would have  to keep the Celestial law, and all nations &amp; religions would  have to bow the knee to God and ac the Christ, but they would not be under the necessity of  being baptized or embracing the Gospel of Christ, but  they must acknowledge the right &amp; reign of Christ   ENDENTRY  a right to, &amp; the Saints or inhabitants of Zion had no right to take from them their religion or persecute them on account of it or  trample upon their rights any way, neither should other nations  or religions trample upon the rights &amp; privileges of the Saints who serve  &amp; obey the Lord of and Keep his Commandments neither would that  be suffered as it has been in times past. And upon this principle  all men or religions may dwell with us in peace, if they will  keep the outward laws of the kingdom of God so as to acknowledg his  name &amp; his right to reign &amp; let us keep the law of the gospel &amp;  obey his commandments undisturbed. After making other rem- arks he left the meeting in the hands of the rest of the Twelve Elder Young said  it was the word of the Lord unto him &amp; was just as much binding  upon him as though it was a written Revelation and it was just  as much binding upon the whole camp as it was upon him &amp; urged  the Saints to give heed to the teachings that were given.    that they could spend them to much better advantage than playing  Cards as there was a world of Knowledge to be obtained &amp; evry leasure  moment should be improved in storeing the mind with some scien learning some good principle and acknowledged the teachings we  had recieved to be of the Lord    wished to say, that a burned child dreaded the fire. He had not  forgotton his journey in the Camp of 1834 and should he  live to the age of Matheusala he should not forget the hour when  the Prophet &amp; Seer  wheel &amp; addressed that Camp &amp; said that because they had  not harkened to his Councel but disobeyed, &amp; transgressed  from time to time, that the die was cast &amp; Judgment  must come that we should be visited by the destroying Angels And so we were &amp; more than twenty of our numbers  fell by the stroke &amp; we all suffered much in our feelings And I pray the Lord I may not see another such a time And I would now advise my brethren to be careful in keeping the Covenant   the days of Joseph &amp; we cannot escape his judgment. I would  advise all the Brethren who have got cards to burn them up  also checkers &amp; dominoes, for if you keep your covenants you  have made you will have no time to use them &amp; they will be  useless lomber on your hands. if you keep them for your children  they will ownly prove, a curse to them. And my prayer to God  is tha with the Lord &amp; each other I rejoice that the watchman  upon the walls or in our mids are quick to comprehend &amp; warn  us of evil &amp; reprove us when wrong that we may de saved &amp; do  the will of God    before he went to preach &amp; asked forgivness, then the camp  dispersed to there waggons &amp; we all started on our journey Br G.

A. Smith went with me to the head of the willow springs we there found a doctor belonging to a Missouri company who  had been doctoring a sick family in a company that was  forward.

I mounted my horse &amp; put after  them &amp; soon overtook them, and made inquiries about our camp they said they had not seen it, but had seen a company of about  a dozen waggons coming by themselves, I then concluded our camp  had stoped at the willow Springs, so Captain Smith who was the  leader of the Mo Company invited us to go on &amp; camp with them for  the night as they did not expect to go but a few miles further than the  creek we were now on. As it was 5 oclok &amp; we could see 5 miles on  the road back &amp; no waggons in sight I concluded our company would  not come on &amp; if they should they would go no further than the  creek so we accepted Capt Smith proposal &amp; went on with him  to spend the night with his camp dut insted of his going but little  distance he continued on mile after mile &amp; could neither find feed  or water except the salt &amp; alkalie ponds &amp; lakes untill we struck  the  in Freemont of the creek before spoken off their oxen had tiered out having  travled about 27 miles &amp; much of the road vary sandy &amp; we had  road about FIGURE 30 miles and was quite weary, the sweet water is  truly sweet to man &amp; beast after travling through so  much ground coverd with salt, perlash, and alkilie water as is found  on the way we turned out our horses in good feed got supper which  was bacon, buffalo, corn bread, coffee Milk &amp;c then lay down  upon the ground &amp; spent the night under a tent with the Missour- ians but did not rest well. I found a great differance between the  Missouri emigrant companies &amp; our own, for while the men, women  &amp; children were all cursing, swaring, quarelling, scolding finding  fault with each other &amp; other companies, there was nothing of the  kind allowed or practiced in our own camp.

He sayes I throw out my Ideas not as doctrin but for you  to look at. you know when a Chemist goes to work to analize or  try new experiments they often have to try many times before they  get a thing perfect &amp; take certain processes which are unnecessary and are  afterward laid aside and pursue the most perfect course that can be  obtained.

And but little fresh water as far as we went while the east side of the valley is as well wattered as any land I ever saw. we took our dinner at the fresh water pool &amp; then rode 6 miles to a large rock on the shore of the Salt lake we here ^we^ made a halt. And all went into the salt  water &amp; we made up our minds at once that the great Salt  lake ought to be added as the eigtht wonder of the world, the watter was quit warm and was impregnated with as much  salt as could possibly be dissolved in water i that if a particle got into the eyes nose or mouth it would  strangle &amp; put one in pain no person could possibly sink in it A person would float &amp; ro log &amp; while standing to our waist in water we could not get our knees to the bottom but would rise to the top like a  cork, we found the most beautiful white salt that I ever saw lying in bunches on the shore whare the water dryed away, the whole  dody of the water will make at least 3 pints of the best quality of white salt to one gallon of water.

I have been much edifyed in the teaching given  by Elder, ^Kimball^ &amp; have reflected much since I came into this valley, concer ning our situation, our calling, &amp; the work that is required at our  hands. And the words of one of the Apostles will apply well to our  case "that when we have done the will of God we have need of  patience that we may obtain the blessing's &amp; though it tarry long  we should obtain it if we continued faithful" Of all  people that ever lived we have the greatest reason to be faithful   ENDENTRY  the greatest work to perform &amp; blessings promised accordingly.

I rejoice  that I enjoy the society of so many of the Saints this day in this  glorious valley which has not been pelluted by the ungodly  gentiles &amp; that I can speak with freedom without being trampled  by wicked men. the difference in the society  &amp; the gentiles in the United States can ownly be contrasted betw- een Heaven &amp; Hell in comparison for let an elder of this church  start from Saint Louis &amp; let the people know  who he is &amp; he would be in Hell all the time &amp; there is a cause for  this a Prophet Seer &amp; Revelater. Patriarchs &amp; Apostles have been raised  up in there midst, the Church &amp; kingdom of God has been planted  among them, the gospel preached &amp; salvation freely offered unto all &amp;  what have they done, they have stoned the Prophets &amp; killed them poured out their blood like water upon the earth, have burned their  dwellings &amp; given their goods to the flames, have driven the Apostles  with the keys of Eternal life &amp; salvation with the entire Church  &amp; kingdom of God out of their midst into the wilderness &amp; the mountais  ye condemnation that lingereth not &amp; there damnation that slumber eth not. And this is the reason why they are full of hell &amp; desire to  destroy every thing that retainets any portion of the spirit  of God. But if it requires all the martered Saints in Heaven from  Righteous Abel to Joseph to go forth from the temple in Heaven  &amp; pour out all the vials of the last plagues upon the United  States &amp; open the seals upon them in order to avenge the blood  of the Prophets &amp; Saints which they have spilt, it will be done  for that blood shall spedily be avenged. Yea vary spedily The Prophet Joseph, The Twelve Apostles,, with many of the  Elders of Israel &amp; Saints have been called to pass through scenes  of sufferings &amp; privations, that would have discouraged an Allexan der, they have had to combat earth and Hell, wicked men &amp; devils,  sickness &amp; death, burnings Drivings &amp; persecutions, but have we ben discouraged no the greater the difficulties the  more we have been stimulated to action, what has sus tained us &amp; inspired us to action in the midst of these  difficulties. We have been upheld by the power of God that  we might fulfill his purposes.

Thus it has been that a combination  of causes of eternal &amp; important consequence has stimulated the Prophet  Apostles &amp; Elders to action untill they have resolved in their hearts that  for Zion they would not rest, untill their righteousness goes forth as brightness  &amp; Salvation as a Lamp that burneth. Yea the time has come for the  Lord to esstablish his kingdom on the earth &amp; to make a short work of it &amp; overthrow the Kingdom of the devel, for He has held dominion on the earth for many generations &amp; in one instance undertook to  claim his right to all the Kingdoms of the world before the Lord when He showed the Savior all the kingdoms of the world &amp; proffered to  give them to him if He would fall down &amp; worship him, when in  fact the  I feel also that the time has come when we can no more preach salvation  to those of the gentiles who have rejected the Prophets &amp; killed them &amp;  cast the saints &amp; the gospel out of their midst, the last time I was through the United States I could not preach salvation to the people  but I could have the spirit of God to preach damnation to them for they were worthy I tried to preach a gospel sermon in the Temple  in Nauvoo to many of the world who were present but it was hard  work to do it.

I hope to speak so as to be understood There is a reality in eternal things as much as in the things of time  which we daily see with our eyes when a man has a dream or  vision of eternal things it is an evidence of its truth as much as  though he saw it with his own eyes in one sens of the word. The  Lord has hid from man the things that He knew before He  came in the flesh that he might walk by faith &amp; prove himself  while here. The Lord converses with men on the earth in the  form of a servent &amp; by visions &amp; dreams &amp;c but He never appears to  man in the flesh in the fulness of his glory, for He is as a  consuming fire &amp; a mortal body would perish in an instant The Priesthood is again restored on the earth to bring back  which    ENDENTRY  will give it up to him. I had my children sealed to me in the  page torn temple except one that died &amp; that I shall leave in the hands of  page torn the Lord, untill I have another opportunity. As soon as we get  up some doby houses for our families we shall go to work to  build another Temple &amp; as soon as a place is prepared we shall  commence the Endowments long before the Temple is built &amp;  we shall take time, &amp; each step the Saints take let them take time  enough about it to understand it. evry thing at Nauvoo went with  a rush we had to build the Temple with the trowel in one hand &amp;  the sword in the other &amp; mobs were upon us all the while and  many crying out O the temple cant be built, I told them it should  be built, this Church should not fall &amp; the Lord said if we did not build it we should be rejected as a Church with our dead why did  He say it because the Saints were becoming slothful &amp; covetous &amp; would  spend their means upon fine houses for themselves before they would  put it into a House for the Lord. But we went at it &amp; finished  it &amp; turned it over into the hands of the Lord in spite of earth &amp; Hell  &amp; the Brethren was so faithful at it that we laboured day and night to give  them their endowments. The Children want to be sealed to their Parents  &amp; Parents to their Children, that they may have blessings in eternity that  they will stand in need of. God promised to Abraham that his seed should be as numerous as the stars of Heaven &amp; the sands of the seashore &amp;  to his seed there should be no end this of course would continue  through all Eternity, the same blessing is upon our heads if we are faith ful for our eyes have not seen, our ears herd neither entered into our  hearts the great things that God has in store for us. &amp; when I look  upon the great work the Elders of Israel have to perform &amp; look around upon them &amp; see them vain &amp; foolish, it makes me sorrowful they forget their Calling. O ye Elders of Israel think for a moment  what manner of persons ought ye to be, men who hold the priesthood  &amp; keys of salvation &amp; have power to go to the Nations of the Earth &amp;  &amp; say Here Gentleman &amp; Ladies I have salvation for you &amp; power to exhalt  you to Celestial Glory, or if you reject it to seal you unto damnation it is no trifling affair to have power put into your hand to deal with  the Eternal destinies of the sons &amp; daughters of Adam that form  the Nations of the earth. While in the Temple at Nauvoo we voted  to cut off the gentiles who had rejected the gospel &amp; killed the prophets &amp; it was recorded on earth &amp; if it is recorded in heaven that Nation will  go down quickly. Many other interesting &amp; important items were presented  by President Young much to our edifycation. meeting was dismissed &amp;  met again at 2  by O Pratt, &amp; treated upon the same principles spoken off by Br  Young. Among his remarks he said, that as all the ordinances of the  gospel administered by the world since the Aposticy of the Church  was illegal, in like manner was the marriage cerimony illegal and all  the world who had been begotton through the illegal marriage, were  bastards &amp; not sons &amp; hence they had to enter into the law of adoption ink spot &amp; be adopted into the Priesthood in order to become sons &amp; legal heirs  of salvation.    fycation after which meeting was dismissed.    in the morning with the ox teams there were over 60 in number  &amp; gave good instruction to them, many of the Battalion deposited there  guns with President Young for safe keeping   ENDENTRY August 16, 1847    to start back.

In the begining of the Council two of the quor um was reproved sharply for undoing what the  majority of the quorum had done in the organizing  of the camps for travelling. At first it was not recieved  but afterwards the error was recieved &amp; seen, confession  made &amp; much teaching given by the President &amp;  the power of God rested upon us &amp; our hearts  melted &amp; our eyes in tears.

No unless they  should get corrupt &amp; do wrong then it would be the duty   ENDENTRY  &amp; teach them what was right, &amp; should the majority of those coun- cils get corrupt &amp; try to lead asstray the people it would then be the  duty of any one of the Twelve to disannul those councils &amp; call upon  the people to sustain him &amp; appoint a new one but while the Councils  are trying to do right it would be the duty of the Twelve who might be  with them to assist them in carrying out those views that the majority  of the Twelve had esstablished. The quorum of the Twelve all  decided that Br Pratt had committed an error in not carrying out the  organization as esstablished by the Twelve Br Pratt at first had  a hard spirit afterwords repented &amp; confessed his fault &amp; the Power  of God rested upon President Young &amp; the whole quorum, President  Young said that he felt Eternity upon him &amp; was weighed down to the  earth with this work &amp; that Br Kimble felt the weight of it more  than any other man except himself each one of the quorum exp ressed their feelings upon the subject &amp; we all had a good time Br Young said he should chastize Br Parley or any one of the quorum as much as he pleased when they were out of the wa they could not help themselves but he done it for their good  &amp; ownly done it when constrained to do it by the power of God  Br.

I feel tender toward you  &amp; want you to live, &amp; If I or my Brethren do wrong tell us of it  &amp; we will repent.
