 REMARKS    By Elder Wilford Woodruff, Tabernacle, Dec. 21, 1856,  Afternoon.    -[REPORTED BY GEO. D. WATT.]-    We have some few missionaries returned   very recently, and I wish to notify them to   meet with us on Tuesday evening in the Seven-  ties' Council Hall; and we want all the Bishops   in the city and the missionaries who have been   appointed to labor here, to meet at the same   place, on the same evening.    I attended the High Priests' meeting last   evening in the company with brs. F. D. Richards   and Lorenzo Snow, and I want to say to all  the High Priests in this city, I want them to   meet with their quorum; and we are going to   meet with you; the Twelve will meet with you,   and with the Seventies, and I want every man   who is a president of Seventies to meet with   his quorum at the time appointed. There was   not more than half the High Priests out last   evening.    We are called upon to wake up and reform   and it makes me feel curious when I go into   and  the High Priests' meeting and see not one half   of them there when a meeting is held to pre-  pare them to wake up the people.    I want this people to listen to what they have   heard to-day. I feel thankful to see br. Kim-  ball again come into this stand. I expressed   my feelings when I saw the sacrament removed   from the table; I felt that it was a loud sermon   to this people; I said I knew not what would   come next; I thought likely the Presidency  would be removed next from us; not that I ex-  pected they would die; br. Grant, however, is   gone; the load he undertook to draw killed him  â€”the same load that was pressing the Presi-  dent of this church to the earth, when Jede-  diah rose up to bear it off; his spirit was strong   enough, but as br. Kimball said, his mortal   body was not strong enough to bear its weight.    The First Presidency have not addressed this   people but a little time since the sacrament was   removed, therefore I was glad to see and hear   br. Kimball to-day.    Although Jedediah has been taken from us,   that load, which in a measure has been removed   from the Presidency of this church, has not re-  turned onto them and I pray it never may.   When Jedediah M. Grant went forth among   the people through the north country and this   city to carry out the views of President Young,   and lifted up his voice like the trump of the   angel of God, and called upon the people to   awake out of their deep sleep and repent of   their sins and turn unto God, the people were   so sound asleep that they did not realize the   importance of his mission; many felt that his   labors and reproofs were unnecessary and un-  called for; the people did not know what he   was doing. Had the vision of their minds been   open as was br. Grant's, and those who sent   him, they would have seen and felt the impor-  tance of that mission.    I tell you the people have been asleep, and   they are not yet half awake, they have not   more than one eye open, and not that quite;   when we hear such things as we have to-day,   this people have got to wake up to righteous-  ness. I have lived twenty-three years in the   church, and I have been acquainted with Pro-  phets and have heard them prophecy, and I   have not yet seen their words fall to the ground   unfulfilled; and when they speak Israel should   hear and obey.    We have been called upon, some of us, as   missionaries to the people of this city, to wake   them up. We shall be among you, brethren,   and we do not intend to let you sleep. Br.   Orson Hyde is with us to-day; he has had a   dream which refers to the wheat and the   thrashing floor. I am glad br. Hyde is with   us, and I want to say to you, br. Hyde, in the   name of the Lord, wake up and rise up in the   midst of your brethren the Twelve, and lead   them forth into the field of labor and we will   stand by you; if you will lead the Twelve, br.   Hyde, in the spirit and power of your calling   as an Apostle of Jesus Christ, you will see   your brethren by your side; we will back you   up, and step forth and help to bear that mighty   load which has rested upon the Presidency of   the church like a mountain and nearly crushed   them to the ground. As a quorum we have   got to more fully obtain the spirit and power   of our apostleship and take more upon ourselves   the care and burthen of the church and king-  dom of God than we have done.    The Twelve Apostles have got to rise up and   magnify their calling or they will be removed   out of their place. The High Priests, the   Seventies, the Bishops and every other quorum   of the church and kingdom of God have got to   do the same or they also will be removed; we   cannot sleep any longer with the priesthood of   Almighty God resting upon us, and the work   that is required at our hands. WE CANNOT   SLEEP. I do not wonder that calling on the   people to wake up has killed one man, and it   will kill more if we do not respond to the call;   mortality cannot endure the visions of eternity   that rests on them when they look on the priest-  hood and see the position they are in; it has   nearly laid br. Young in the grave; he felt he   could not live until some man rose up and   started the work of reformation.    I know it is my duty to wake up and enter   into the labors of my calling, and it is the   duty of Elder Hyde, and the duty of every   other man in Israel that bears this priesthood   to do the same; it is our duty to bear off that   burden and labor which has been resting like a   mountain upon the leaders of this church. I   know they have groaned under the load that   has rested on them, when they have seen all   Israel going to sleep.    Let the Twelve Apostles, and the Seventy   Apostles, and the High Priest Apostles, and   all other Apostles rise up and keep pace with   the work of the Lord God, for we have no   time to sleep. What is a man's life good for,   or his words or work good for when he stands   in the way of men's salvation, exaltation and  glory? They are of no use at all.    As an individual I am determined to wake   up and do my duty, God being my helper. I   want to see br. Hyde, who is the president of   the Twelve, walk into all these quorums and   attend their meetings, and we will back him up;   I want him to lift up his voice like a trumpet   and go to winnowing the wheat; it is for the   Twelve to rise up and carry off the load. The   Seventies have got to walk up in their place   and do their duty. I know God requires this   at our hands. The law of God, the holy priest-  hood, and the holy anointing and washing, and   everything else that is holy requires it at our   hands. I know this.    It is necessary to reform. The question may   be asked, what is the matter? Why, we are   asleep; if the eyes of any man or woman is   opened as they should be, they could see the   things of God as they are in one moment; they   would see there is a necessity of waking up   and doing something. Here is a great and   mighty dispensation committed into the hands   of this people for the living and the dead; the  candle of the Lord God is placed in these   mountains like a city that is set on a hill   that cannot be hid; the work is on your shoulders,   ye Priest of the Most High God!â€”on you   rests the salvation of this generation, and the   Lord will require this stewardship at your   hands.    The Lord has given you the keys of the   priesthood with all the blessings pertaining to   itâ€”as great and as mighty a work as ever was   committed to any man on the earth, and that   too in the midst of the last dispensation and   fulness of times. The Lord requires us to   prepare this generation, both Jew and Gentile,   either for salvation or damnation through the   proclamation of the gospel of Jesus Christ and   the administering of the ordinances of the   House of God, and we go to sleep!â€”the Apos-  tles go to sleep!!â€”the Seventies go to sleep!!!   the Elders of Israel close their eyes to slumber,   and we the only people God has on the earth,   upon whose shoulders he has laid the respon-  sibility of performing this great and mighty   work!    Do you wonder that Prophets get up here   and chastise, and draw the sword of justice   and hold it over our heads? I do not. I won-  der that our children at the fire side do not rise   up and prophecy, with a voice like thunder and   in flames of fire, unto their fathers and mothers,   and unto the people of Israel. I know that   the counsels we have had here through the   mouth of the Prophets of God are just and   true. I know that the warning voice that has   been heard in this Stand, and the call that has   been made on this floor is necessary; and I do   hope and pray God that we, as missionaries,   will listen to it. I want my brother mission-  aries in the first place to wake up, and get   aroused with the mantle of salvation and Spirit   of God ourselves, and get our own armor   bright. It has been justly remarked here that   we have got to labor ourselves until we get the   Spirit of God, and then we can walk out among   the people and correct them; but if we as Sev-  enties, as High Priests, and Apostles, and   Elders bearing the priesthood, if we are re-  solved to set our hearts upon things of this earth,  without being engaged in the interest of the   kingdom of God, what can we expect of the   people? Not anything. I desire that we may   all wake up, and listen to the counsel of these   men who lead us from day to day.    We have no time to lose to prepare ourselves   for the things that are coming on the earth;   and who wants to lose his crown, his glory,   and hope of eternal lives that he has had in   days past and gone by receiving the gospel of   Jesus Christ? No man that has any portion   of the Spirit of God. Let us rise up and mag-  nify our calling, and labor before God until we   can get the Holy Spirit, and until our prayers   rend the vail of eternity and enter into the ears   of the God of Sabbaoth and be answered in   blessings upon our heads.    When shall the fire be kindled in Zion?  I do   not mean wild fireâ€”there is a true fire, and   that is the fire we need to get, that is neces-  sary to kindle; and if we live up to our privi-  leges, do our duty, walk up to the word of the   Lord God and magnify our calling we do know   that the blessings of God will attend us, and   the sinners in Zion will tremble and fearful-  ness will surprise the hypocrite; and let what   will come, all will be right with the Latter   Day Saints.    There are great things awaiting us and the   worldâ€”the Lord is withdrawing his Spirit from   the nations of the earth, his sword is bathed   in heaven and will fall upon Idumea or the   world; the seals are about to be opened and   the judgments of God poured out upon the   wicked, the cup of their wickedness and   abominations is filled to the brim and the in-  dignation of the Lord will be poured out with-  out measure.    Let the Saints read the revelations of God   and they will see that there are important   events at our doors. Let us hearken and wake   up, and be doing the things required of us.    Let the missionaries first get their lamps trim-  med and burning, and then go among the peo-  ple, and go with the Spirit of God and the sal-  vation of the gospel of Jesus Christ; and let   the other quorums do the same; and when   you do this you will see a reform, and sin and ini-  quity cannot abide in our habitations, in our   wards, or in our city.    We have sin and sinners among us, and what   are we going to do about it? Why, we are   going to try to live our religion, and when we   do that we shall do right. The business with   me is to do right to-day, to live my religion   to-day and leave the events with God; he holds   the destinies of the nations and of all men;   they are in his hand; he made the earth and   controls the children of men upon it.    Then let events roll onâ€”if we are only right,   all is well. We have got to be tried even unto   death. The Lord says he will prove us, and   see if we abide in his covenants. There is   where we have got to stand as a people, not   only our horses, and gold and silver, and land   and houses, but our lives have got to lie on the   altar, and when anything comes to test us, even   at the stake of our lives, we should be in the   possession of the Holy Ghost not to flee from  it, and such will be crowned with the gift of   eternal lives, exaltation and glory.    There is nothing to encourage a man to draw   back; there is nothing short of the most dam-  nable principle that dwells in the spirit of devils   that would tempt any man to shed the blood of   the Lord's anointed, yet men will try to do it.    There are men here to-day who will possess   that spirit; I believe it; they are in our city.    If they shed blood they have got the bill to   pay.  Let the wicked and the ungodly, who   will not repent, but fight against God, do their   worst, their time is short, and the day will   come, and that soon, when they will be called   to judgment.    I remember what Joseph said, a short time   before he was slain in one of the last sermons   I ever heard him preach. Says he, 'Men are   here to-day who are seeking my blood, and they   are those who have held the priesthood and   have received their washings and anointings;   men who have received their endowments.' I   saw the faces of those men at that time and   they had a hand in slaying the Prophet. There   are men who possess the same spirit and   the same desire. There are men here, too,   that have faith, that have the priesthood and   the spirit of it, and they will do their duty, and   God will sustain them in it, and he will sustain   this church and kingdom; let the trials of the   Saints be what they will, the kingdom of God   is not to be torn down any more at allâ€”it will   not again be taken from the earth until it is   prepared to receive Christ at his coming.    Let us prepare ourselves and do our duty,   and let the High Priests and Seventies go to   their meetings, and before you go there, go to   work and get the Spirit of God, that when you   get there you may not freeze to death. And I   want to have the people, when they come here,   to get enough of the Spirit of God that when   the Presidency rise in this Stand they may give   us what is in their hearts. They are filled   with blessings for this people. All the trouble   is our eyes have been closed, we have been in a  deep sleep; let us wake up and attend to our   duty, and make it the first business we do.    Those who lay their plans in secret cham-  bers to seek the blood of the Prophets will   have their case attended to by messengers on   the other side of the vail, ministers will be   sent to them who will render unto them a right-  eous judgment there. I do not want to preach   to them here, but to those who want to be   saved.    Go to and if you have not the Spirit of God,   make it your first business to get it, that your   minds may be opened to see the things of God   as they are; it is your privilege and mine; that   we may be prepared for what is to come.    That this people may repent of all their sins   and wake up, and have power to come before   God that their prayers may be heard, be pre-  pared to defend the kingdom and never desert   their covenants and their brethren, or betray   the gospel, but overcome the world, and be pre-  pared to become joint heirs with Christ to the   fulness of the first resurrection which is pre-  pared for those who keep the commandments   of God, is my prayer in the name of Jesus   Christ: Amen. 
 arose; I feel better now, and as though  I had been refreshed in spirit. I thank  God I am able to talk to you, as the say-  ing is, in my old age. The Lord has  been very merciful to me. The devil  has sought to kill me from the day I  was born; but God has had an agent  with me to keep me from his power, and  so far I have been preserved. I hope  the Lord will not let me live an hour  longer than I can live in his service. But  I am a feeble manâ€”weak like the rest  of you. If anybody supposes that the  Presidency and Apostles here are never  tempted of the devil, they are mistaken.  We are tempted all the time, more or  less, and we have to war against these  things in order to stand and maintain  our position. I pray God that His  blessings may rest upon us. I rejoice  in this conference. It has been a glor-  ious time. There is a good spirit here;  and the testimonies that have been  given unto us by the power of God have  been choice. The angels are watching  over us. The eyes of all the heavenly  hosts are over us. Those who have  lived in other dispensations understand  this dispensation far better than we do,  and they are watching over the labors  of the Elders of Israel. I pray that we  may pursue that course wherein we may  be justified before God, and have power  to conquer and overcome; and when we  have finished here, that we can go home  to receive our reward. The great library  in the celestial kingdom of our God con-  tains the history of the dealings of God  with all the world, for it belongs to this  world. Your history is there; mine is  there; our testimonies are there; and we  will have to meet them. I hope and  pray that my sins may be blotted out of  the book of remembrance and not be  remembered against me. I hope and  pray this will be the case with you; for  blessed is the man that will meet this  blessing when he comes to the end!  God bless you. Amen. 
 DISCOURSE  Delivered by President Wilford Wood-  ruff, at Logan (Cache Stake Con-  ference), Sunday Morning, Aug.  3rd, 1890.    I have a few thoughts and reflec-  tions which I would like to present   to the Latter-day Saints who com-  pose this conference; but in order to  do it, I need the help and assistance   of the Spirit of God, as does every  man who attempts to teach the  people.    The subject that I have upon my  mind is, union among the Latter-  day Saints. The Savior said to His   Apostles anciently, and to the   Apostles in our day: "I say unto   you, be one; and if ye are not one  ye are not mine." [##Doctrine and Covenants 38:27##] "I and my   Father are one." [##John 10:30##] There is a prin-  ciple connected with this that I   think is very important to us as   a people and as a Church here on  the earth. With all the divisions,  and all the discontent, and the  quarrelings and opposition among   the powers on earth, or that have   been revealed from heaven, I have  never heard that it has ever  been revealed to the children of men  that there was any division between  God the Father, God the Son and  God the Holy Ghost. They are one.   They always have been one. They   always will be one, from eternity   unto eternity. Our Heavenly Father  stands at the head, being the Author  of the salvation of the children of   men, and having created and   peopled the world and given laws to   the inhabitants of the earth. This   principle is shown unto us by the   revelation of the laws which belong  to the different kingdoms. There is  a celestial kingdom, a terrestrial   kingdom, and a telestial kingdom.  There is a glory of the sun, a glory   of the moon, and a glory of the stars;   and as one star differs from another  star in glory, so also is the resurrec-  tion of the dead. In the celestial   Kingdom of God there is oneness,  there is union.    In reading the history of the   dealings of God with men, from the   Bible, the Book of Mormon, and the  Doctrine and Covenants, we can  see that, from the days of Father   Adam, the Lord has raised up a  class of men, in every dispensation,   upon whom He has bestowed His  Priesthood, and unto whom He has  given power and authority to do His  work upon the face of the earth   among the children of men.  And   these men have been in possession   of principles of union with God,   with the Son of God and with the  Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost was  given to Father Adam; he was filled  with it when, in his last days, he  blessed those of his sons who were   High Priests and the residue of his  posterity. [##Doctrine and Covenants 107:53##] Father Adam, Enoch,  Moses, Noah, Abraham, Isaac and  Jacob, and all those old patriarchs   and prophets were obliged to have   communion with God. They were  under the necessity of seeking unto   the Lord, for unless they had this  communion they were not  qualified to do their duty.   They were dependent upon  the Lord for revelation, for light,  and for instruction to have power to   carry out the commandments of   God. This union that the Lord re-  quired of the ancient patriarchs and   prophets, and which Jesus required  of His Apostles, was required of   Joseph Smith and his brethren. It   has been required of all Saints of   God from the foundation of the   world till today.  Men who have   held any portion of the Holy Priest-  hood, and have had its gifts, graces,   and blessings bestowed upon them,   have been under the necessity of   having communion with God. In   the whole history of the world I   have never read of any man whom  God has called to stand as the head of   His work, who has not sought the  Lord while in that position; and the  Lord has been with him. It is my   faith that the Lord will never per-  mit any man upon whose shoulders  He places the authority and power  to lead Israel, to go astray, or to   lead the children of God from the  path of duty. The Lord would re-  move such a man from his place.    In every age of the world the  Saints of God have been obliged to   be united. Babylon may divide;  the inhabitants of the earth may   have all the division they wish for;   but they will receive the results of   that disunion, and have done all   the way through. City after city,   nation after nation has been de-  stroyed by the judgments of the Al-  mighty whenever it has become   ripened in iniquity, as in the  case of Sodom and Gomorrah, of   Babylon, Nineveh, Tyre and Si-  don, and a great many other ancient   cities and countries. But the Saints  of God cannot prosper unless they   are united. This has been demon-  strated in the history of the world.    Moses, in his day, was obliged to  have communion and fellowship   with God. The Lord gave unto  him commandments, upon tables   of stone, for the guidance of the   children of Israel. When Moses  came down from the mountain and  saw the rebellion, the dissension  and the abominations of the Is-  raelitesâ€”that, notwithstanding all  the miracles they had witnessed,   revelations they had been given,   they had made a golden calf to  worship, because he had come   back to them in timeâ€”he was so  angry at their wickedness that he  cast the tables of stone to the   ground and broke them. [##Exodus 32##] Of  course you all know about   this. But Moses had to have   union with God. So in the   whole history of the people of God   in all ages. They have had to be  united. They have had to work to-  gether. They have had to receive  the law of God together. Jesus

 Third Day, April 6th.    PRESIDENT WOODRUFF  was the first speaker. His remarks  were as follows:    I want to say to my brethren and sis-  ters and friends that through your   prayers and faith I am here this morn-  ing. I have been considerably under  the weather, as the saying is, for a little  time past, but I am glad to meet with  you and feel to say a few words to you  this morning. I know it would not be  wisdom for me to attempt to occupy a  great deal of time or say a great deal.  First, I will say that I have fol-  lowed the reports and sayings [of] the  Apostles and Elders from the commence-  ment of this Conference until this  morning; what I have not read my-  self has been read to me, and it has  been a great deal of consolation to me.  I want to say to the Latter-day Saints,  the God of heaven is at work carrying  out His purposes in fulfilment of reve-  lation and prophecy and inspiration,   which He has given through His   Prophets and Apostles and Patriarchs   from the creation of the world until   this hour. And the Lord is not going  to fail on His part in any of these   things. It is for us as a people to do  our duty, to labor for ourselves and for  our fellowmen; to occupy the time  that we have here, to the best advan-  tage we can, in trying to honor the   Priesthood and people, to build up the  kingdom of God, to set a good exam-  ple, and to establish righteousness.  And I want to say to the young men  and maidens, my young brethren and   sisters, who may be present here this  morning, I want you to make your   aim high and realize that you have  your generation, that you have your  times granted in connection with  your fathers and mothers in the   building up of the kingdom   of God. Do not spend your   time in the follies and frivolities of this  world, but try to improve your time.  You occupy one of the most important   dispensations and generations God has   ever given to men, and I have a great  interest for the rising generation.

 REMARKS    Made by President Wilford Woodruff,   At Paris, Idaho (Bear Lake Stake  Conference) on Monday Afternoon,   August 10, 1891.    [REPORTED BY ARTHUR WINTER.]    I am very pleased indeed to meet   with so many Latter-day Saints in this  tabernacle on a working day, and I   hope you will get paid for coming to  meeting today. I have felt amply  paid myself for my journey from Salt   Lake City in listening to the instruc-  tions which our brethren have given unto us.   I told Brother Cannon this   morning that if, when a young man, I   could have attended a meeting of this   kind and heard instructions as   we have had given to us, I   should have felt that I was in heaven;   I should have been satisfied that I had   received what I had prayed for and de-  sired from my childhood. When I was  a boy I read in the New Testament   concerning Jesus Christ and His Gos-  pel, and the gifts and graces that were   then manifested, and I felt that the  principles there taught were the ones   that I desired to live to hear taught. I  prayed for this earnestly in my early   manhood. I have read the Bible  through a good many times in my life.   I have read the Book of Mormon   through a number of times.  I have   also read the Book of Doctrine and   Covenants through a number of times;   and I have felt that God had never given  unto us stronger principles and more   glorious instructions in any of the  revelations of God than are recorded in   the Book of Doctrine and Covenants.    They are all by the same author, but   to different men, and at different times.    I will read a few verses from the  121st section of the Doctrine and Covenants.  This section contains the prayer and  prophecy of the Prophet Joseph while  he was in Liberty jail; and the truths  embodied therein are among the sub-  limest that God has ever revealed to   man:    For there is a time appointed for every  man, according as his works shall be.    God shall give unto you (the Saints)   knowledge by His Holy Spirit, yea by   the unspeakable gift of the Holy Ghost,  that has not been revealed since the world   was until now;    Which our forefathers have waited  with anxious expectation to be revealed   in the last times, which their minds were  appointed to, by the angels, as held in re-  serve for the fullness of their glory:    A time to come in the which nothing   shall be withheld, whether there be one   God or many Gods they shall be mani-  fest;    All thrones and dominions, princi-  palities and powers, shall be revealed  and set forth upon all who have endured   valiantly for the Gospel of Jesus Christ;    And also if there be bounds set to the  heavens, or to the seas; or to the dry   land, or to the sun, moon, or stars;    All the times of their revolutions: all   the appointed days, months, and years,  and all the days of their days, months,   and years, and their glories, laws, and   set times, shall be revealed, in the days of   the dispensation of the fulness of times,    According to that which was ordained   in the midst of the Council of the Eternal   God of all other Gods, before this world   was, that should be reserved unto the   finishing and the end thereof, when   every man shall enter into his eternal  presence, and into his mortal rest.    How long can rolling waters remain  impure? What power shall stay the  heavens? As well might man stretch  forth his puny arm to stop the Missouri   river in its decreed course, or to turn it   up stream, as to hinder the Almighty  from pouring down knowledge from   heaven, upon the heads of the Latter-day   Saints.    Behold, there are may called, but few   are chosen. And why are they not   chosen?    Because their hearts are set so much   upon the things of this world, and aspire   to the honors of men, that they do not  learn this one lessonâ€”    That the rights of the Priesthood are   inseparably connected with the powers   of heaven, and that the powers of heaven  cannot be controlled nor handled only   upon the principles of righteousness.    That they may be conferred upon us, it   is true; but when we undertake to cover   our sins, or to gratify our pride, our vain   ambition, or to exercise control, or do-  minion, or compulsion, upon the souls of  the children of men, in any degree of un-  righteousness, behold, the heavens with-  draw themselves; the Spirit of the Lord   is grieved; and when it is withdrawn,   Amen to the Priesthood, or the authority   of that man.    Behold! ere he is aware, he is left to   himself, to kick against the pricks; to   persecute the Saints, and to fight against  God.    We have learned, by sad experience,   that it is the nature and disposition of al-  most all men, as soon as they get a little   authority, as they suppose, they will im-  mediately begin to exercise unrighteous   dominion.    Hence many are called, but few are   chosen.    Who can comprehend this grand   language?  Scarcely any person. The   Lord says in this revelation that   whether there be one God or many   Gods, they shall be revealed; and all   kingdoms, thrones, principalities and   powers shall be revealed unto those   who keep His commandments. Can   we comprehend this? Why, there is   not an astronomer that can tell us   scarcely one thing that is done in Mars,  or Venus, or Jupiter, or in any of the   planets, aside from the earth. Here  are worlds upon worldsâ€”millions of   themâ€”and what do we know about   them? Our own little planet, upon   which we live, is about as much as we   can comprehend.  Look at the extent   of the blessings that are promised us!    These blessings and these revelations   are worthy the attention of the Latter-day  Saints.    In this revelation it is shown that   the Priesthood of which we have been  speaking, has power. It has power   with the heavens; it has power on   earth. And as was said this morning, it   does not make any difference what   portion of that Priesthood a man holds  â€”whether it is a President, an Apostle,   an High Priest, a Seventy, an Elder, a   Priest, a Teacher or a Deaconâ€”when   he goes before God in prayer, with a 
 MINUTES OF THE GENERAL CONFERENCE.    are in this Territory, and then it always  would bring peace to the hearts of those  who had to be judged. He expressed his  indignation and abhorrence of the scenes  which transpired, in driving the Latter-  day Saints from Missouri and Illinois.    He then presented a description of the  monument intended to be built to the   memory of Gen. Washington, and finish-  ed his discourse by saying, that he should  always remember with deep gratitude,  and respect, his interview with the Lat-  ter-day Saints in their mountain city.    He was followed in his remarks by  President Young, and the congregation  was dismissed with benediction by Elder  Wilford Woodruff.    2 O'CLOCK, P.M.

Young exhorted the saints to keep profound  silence, and told the doorkeepers to stop driving away  those children who come early in order to get a seat in   which to hear and worship comfortably.    Elder George A. Smith addressed the congregation,   saying it is enough to try the lungs of a giant to speak to   this immense congregation.  Alluded to the church on the   6th of April, 1830, when it was organized with six mem-  bers, and now those few have increased to a great and  mighty people.

In accordance with a resolution passed by the Conven-  tion, the Constitution of the State of Deseret was read by   Thomas Bullock, and presented by Prest. Grant, for ap-  proval or disapproval by the people, when it was unani-  mously adopted by the vast host of electors present.

 THE DESERET WEEKLY.    A PRIESTHOOD MEETING  was held in the evening, beginning at   7 o'clock. It was probably the largest   gathering of the kind ever held since   the organization of the Church in this   dispensation. The speakers were, in   the order in which they addressed the   assemblage, Presidents George Q. Can-  non, Joseph F. Smith and Wilford   Woodruff. The themes dwelt upon 
 was one with the Father. Says He:   "For I came down from heaven,  not to do mine own will, but the   will of him that sent me." [##John 6:38##] This  union was never broken between   the Father and the Son. The first   revelation given to Joseph Smith   was that of the Father and the Son.   The heavens were opened, and the  Father, with His Son, appeared to   Joseph, in answer to his prayer,   and He pointed to His Son and said,  "This is my beloved Son; hear ye  him." [##Joseph Smith-History 1:17##] This is a peculiarity that I   have no recollection of ever being  manifest in any other age of the  world. Another peculiar feature  connected with this dispensation is   that the God of heaven has bestow-  ed upon almost all the male mem-  bers of the Church the Holy Priest-  hood.    This union was necessary between   God and the prophets and apostles  of old. Unless that union had ex-  isted between Him and His serv-  ants it could not have extended   throughout the children of Israel   or among the children of men.   It is also of vast importance to us in   this Church and kingdom. I will   say myself that I do not believe there   ever was a man, save Jesus Christ,   that was more closely united and   associated with God the Father, and   God the Son, and God the Holy  Ghost, than the Prophet Joseph  Smith. The power of revelation  was with him from the day that he  was called to receive the Priesthood  up to the time when he was martyr-  ed. The power of inspiration was   with him day by day. This is   plainly manifest in the revelations  contained in the Book of Doctrine   and Covenants. Whenever the   Lord felt disposed to reprove him,  Joseph Smith, through his own  mouth, had to reprove himself; and  he did not hesitate to give the word   of the Lord, though it was against  himself. He was united with the  Lord; he was united with the Holy  Ghost; he was united with the  angels in heaven, with Peter, James  and John and with John the Bap-  tist. He received the Priesthood   from under their hands. [##Doctrine and Covenants 128:20##] [##Joseph Smith-History 1:72##] Joseph   called twelve Apostles. Who were  they? The Lord said to him: "The   twelve are they who shall desire to  take upon them my name with  full purpose of heart; and if  they desire to take upon   them my name with full purpose of   heart, they are called to go into all  the world to preach my gospel unto  every creature." [##Doctrine and Covenants 18:27-28##] The history of   these twelve Apostles we are some-  what acquainted with. I have been  associated with the Apostleship for   over fifty years. I knew those men.   I knew their lives. When the  Prophet Joseph organized the   Quorum of the twelve Apostles, he   taught this principle of union to   them. He gave them to understand   that they must be of one heart and  one mind, and they must take upon   themselves fully the name of   Christ; that if God commanded   them to do anything they must   go and do it; that if they mar-  ried a wife they could not stay  at home three or four years to take  care of her if they were called   to go to the nations of the earth.    I myself started on a mission six  weeks after I was married, and I   was gone two or three years. So   with others of my brethren. It   mattered not what temporal work   we had to do, when we were called   to go abroad we had to go. This   was one of the requirements of the   Apostleship. We also had to be  united. We could not contend one   with another. If we did, the Spirit   of God would be withdrawn from  us, and we would receive chastise-  ment at the hands of the Lord.   Under the celestial law of the  Kingdom of God men must unite  together; men must love one   another; men must stand by this   Holy Priesthood and maintain the  powers of it while they dwell in the  flesh, in order to honor God and to  be prepared to receive their inherit-  ances in the world to come.    As I have said before, I have been  a member of the Quorum of the  Apostles for over fifty years. I bave [have]  been acquainted with its ups and   downs. I have been familiar with  the apostates. I have also been ac-  quainted with the union that has   existed. I can say that I never asso-  ciated with a class of men that ever   manifested the same love for one an-  other as the Apostles of the Church  have when they have been faith-  ful. Of course, we have seen days   of sorrow. After that first Quorum   was called of God; after they had   had the ministration of angels and  seen the power of God manifested,   some of them yielded to temptation.   They said, "We have served God   long enough, and now we are going  to serve ourselves."  They stopped   praying and went to merchandising.   They stopped serving God, and took   a decided stand against the Prophet  whom God had raised up to lay the   foundation of this Church and  kingdom. What were the conse-  quences? It sent them to perdi-  tion. Their power fell like light-  ning from heaven. Their priest-  hood was taken from them, and  sealed upon the heads of other men.   It has remained so to this day, and  will, for all I know, to the endless  ages of etenrity. With all the light   they had, with all the power  they had, and with all the   manifestations they had from  God out of heaven, they   turned from these things and re-  jected them. Those were days of   sorrow to me and to those who re-  mained faithful; for one half of the   Quorum fell and turned against   Joseph. But the Lord was with   him. So was Brigham Young and  Heber C. Kimball and others of the  brethren of the quorum. They stood   by him; while others deserted him   and were cut off the Church, and   they to-day are in the Spirit world,   without the Priesthood, without  their crown, without their glory,   and without the celestial blessings   that were promised them on con-  dition of their faithfulness.    With this exception, the Quorum  of the twelve Apostles have been   united. We knew this was the work  of God. We knew the God of   heaven had laid this Apostleship up-  on our shoulders. We knew, as  Joseph Smith told us just before his  martyrdom, that if we did not round   up our shoulders and bear off this  kingdom we would be damned. No  man can receive this Apostleship;   no man can bear this Priesthood; no   man can be called to this important   calling, and then turn from it, with-  out condemnation or being cursed   by the hand of God. It matters not   what sacrifices God requires at our   hands in the building up of His   kingdom, we have got to meet these  things and trust in Him.    The Prophet Joseph, in his day,   consulted with the Apostles and   sought their views on important   matters and principles. He would   say, "I want you to tell me your   views and feelings about this, that  and the other." The agency which  God had given us was never taken   from us, either by Him or His   Prophet. We used to express our   feelings to the Prophet, and we did   so with all good conscience before   God. As a general thing our views  were alike; but if there was any-  thing in them different from what   Joseph considered was right, when  we got through he would tell us  thus and so. Then we did not stand  against that, but we united upon it.   One of the Apostles once brought  before the Prophet Joseph a very pe-  culiar kind of a system. Joseph   listened to him very patiently, and   when this brother got through he  says, "Brother Joseph, what do  you think of that?" "Why," says   he, "Brother â€”â€”â€”, it is a beautiful  system, and I have only one fault  in the world to find about it."   "What is it?" "It is not true."    Of course, when a man gets up a   thing that is not true, he has to lay  it aside.    I want to say, for the comfort of   the Latter-day Saints, that God is   not going to fail anybody. He has  carried out His purposes in every  age and generation of men. As  Brother Snow said today, He raised  up old father Abraham to stand at  the head of the House of Israel, be-  cause he was a noble spirit. Before  he was born he occupied such a   position with God, in his agency,  that he was given supremacy here  on the earth. He stands at the  head of his posterity, and at the  head of Israel, and will  occupy that position forever.   The Lord is not going to  disappoint us. He has fulfilled His   work up to the present time; and  now comes the consummation, the   winding up scene, and the fulfil-  ment of all those prophecies and   revelations which God has given to   inspired men, who were moved   upon by the Holy Ghost. Those  revelations you and I are fulfilling.  Joseph Smith laid the foundation of  this work. He holds the key of the  Kingdom today, and will to the   endless ages of eternity. He has   passed and gone. Over twenty   Apostles have passed away. Those   who laid the foundation of this   work are now in the Spirit world.   But we are alive here, and have   yet a few days in which to work.  Today we have a Quorum of Twelve  Apostles. When men have died or   apostatized, others have been called   to fill their places. When the   Prophet Joseph was taken away,  President Young occupied his 
 PRIESTHOOD MEETING.    A Priesthood meeting was held in   the Tabernacle on the evening of Tues-  day, April 5th. It was probably the   largest gathering of the kind that has  ever convened in the history of the   Church in this dispensation. The  speakers were, in the order in which  they addressed the assembly: Presi-  dent Joseph F. Smith, President  George Q. Cannon and President   Wilford Woodruff. Much valuabe in-  struction was embodied in their re-  marks.    President Wilford Woodruff    said in substance: If there is any scene   on the face of this earth that will at-  tract the attention of the God of  heaven and the heavenly host, it is the  one before us today--the assembling of   this people, the shout of "Hosanna,"   the laying of the top stone of this tem-  ple in honor to our God. My brethren,  sisters and friends, we want to finish   this Temple; we want to dedicate it un-  to God as soon as we can, so that the vast  host who dwell in this region of   country may go into it and attend to   the ordinances for their living and for   their dead. I hope we shall all lay  this to heart and try to furnish means   so far as we can, in order that the   building may be speedily completed.   We are able, as a people, to do this. I  realize that there are many calls upon  the Latter-day Saints for the work and  purposes of the Church and kingdon of  God upon the earth; but this work now   before us is a most important event--  the most important that we have upon   our hands. I well remember the day  and the hour when this first   revelation for the redemption   of our dead was received by the mouth  of the Prophet of God. Who can com-  prehend this? Where is the man or   woman who can comprehend this   principle, that we have the power to   go into these Temples of our God and  redeem our progenitors--our fathers  and our mothers, from whom we have  descended? They never heard the   Gospel; they never enjoyed the bless-  ings which you and I have in our day   and time through the mercy of  God. We are their posterity. They  are on the other side of the vail, shut  up in prison, and will remain there 
 6-9 Oct 1892, 62nd Semi-Annual General Conference, SLC Tabernacle.  [Deseret News Weekly 45:513, 10/15/92, p 1; Millennial Star 54:689, 705, 721, 737, 769, 785, 801]  [7 Oct, 7 pm]  [DNW 45:517, 10/15/92, p 5]  PRIESTHOOD MEETING.    A meeting of the general Priesthood  was held in the Tabernacle last night,  April 7th, beginning at 7 o'clock. The  first speaker was President Joseph F.   Smith. He gave much practical in-  struction upon the subject of looking   after the moral and religious welfare of  the young, and seeing that they were   not permitted to spend their time in   idleness. He also spoke deprecatingly   of the disregard paid by many to the  commandment of God in relation to  the observance of the Sabbath day. The  concluding portion of his discourse   was devoted to the evils growing out   of going into debt without sufficient   reason; the dangers of extravagance  and class distinctions on the basis of   wealth. He also exhorted his hearers  to contribute generously to the funds   needed to complete the Temple in this  city.    President Woodruff followed by de-  livering a discourse upon the magni-  tude of the work of God and the re-  sponsibilities resting upon those who   held the Priesthood.    President George Q. Cannon spoke  upon the importance of those holding   high office in the Church being care-  ful as to how they used their author-  ity, as they would be held to strict   accountability by the Lord for the  manner in which they exercised their  callings. None of the humblest of   God's creatures could be wronged with  impunity. He spoke also on the neces-  sity of being charitable and of the evil  results of backbiting; also upon the   necessity of seeking to save our off-  spring, who, according to the everlast-  ing covenant, were the children of   promise. We ought to have great   hopes of them, even when they went   astray, exercising faith that they   might be reclaimed.   
 fact there are very few who compre-  hend today the position we occupy,  and the responsibility we are under to  God and the Holy Priesthood, who   have raised us up and placed us here   in the midst of a generation of men  and women, children of men, upon   whose heads are going to rest great  responsibilities, in the great events  which are to follow each other in  quick succession in the day in which  we live.    As far as I am concerned, I do not  know, it has never been revealed to  me, why my life has been pre-  served, while the Lord has   taken away Prophets and Apostles   and other men of God, who have  spent three or four, ten or twelve,   fourteen or fifteen years in the capa-  city of the building up of the kingdom  of God. Our Savior Himself was only   three years and a half in passing   through His experiences of teaching  the people, the organization of the   kingdom of God, the choosing of the  Twelve Apostles, His crucifixion,   His death and His resurrection. The  Prophet Joseph spent about fourteen   years in translating the Book of Mor-  mon, the history of the Jews, the   House of Israel on this continent, and  the dealings of God with that people.   He performed that work, and brought  forth the book of Doctrine and Cove-  nants, a code of revelations as great in  language and principles, and the  account of as great and important   events as have ever occurred on the   earth. He performed all this work in  about fourteen years and a half. My  brethren, the Apostles, two or three   quorums, have passed away since my  ordination; nearly all but myself up to  a certain period, have passed. I am   not speaking these things boastfully,  but I am here, and it is my duty   while I remain here, to try to say   something that will be of interest to   the Latter-day Saints. I am interested   in your welfare, in the welfare of Zion.   It is the Zion of God, planted here by  the hand of God, and the Lord has   guided and directed it, and will con-  tinue to do so.    You have Apostles with you, you   have High Priests, and Seventies, and  the other bodies of Priesthood, and   they have a great responsibility resting  upon them, in the capacity in which  they labor. I have a great desire,  what time I do live, to see the people  progress, to become united, to compre-  hend and to understand the spirit and   power of God and their calling; you  should do this, and you have got to do  something of this kind, in order to  carry out the purposes of the Lord.   You stand here in the mountains of   Israel, raised up by the Lord. You  have done a great work here, and there   is a great deal more to do. You are  redeeming the dead and the living,  and sending abroad thousands of the  Elders to warn the nations of the earth  of those events which are to come upon  them and upon us. Therefore, the  Elders should try to be faithful,   and we should watch over our sons  and daughters, give them good advice,   and set them a good example that we   may have no regrets of their falling   into principles and practices which  are not right and righteous before   God, on account of our example.    I say, God bless you; labor for   the Holy Spirit, labor for light and truth,    for revelation and inspiration, learn  the mind and will of God concerning   yourselves and the truth of the work  of God on the earth. Keep your eyes   open to see, your ears to hear, and   your hearts to understand the truth,  and that you may see the hand of God  visible throughout this land and  throughout this nation, and through-  out the world, which will be more  and more visible from this time to the  winding-up scene. God bless you,  amen.

 pure heart, that Priesthood has power   with the heavens. If a man magnifies   that Priesthood, the blessings of God   are with him.    The first sermon that I ever heard in   this church was in 1833, by old father   Zera Pulsipher, who died in the south,   after having lived to be considerably   over eighty years old. That sermon   was what I had prayed for from my   childhood. When I heard it I had a   testimony for myself that it was true.   I received it with every sentiment of   my heart. He preached in a school   house upon a farm that we owned in   Oswego County, New York. He   opened the door for any remarks to be   made. The house was crowded. The   first thing I knew I stood on top of a   bench before the people, not knowing   what I got up for. But I said to my   neighbors and friends, "I want you to   be careful what you say as touching   these men (there were two of them) and   their testimony, for they are servants   of God and they have testified   unto us the truthâ€”principles that I   have been looking for from my child-  hood." I went forth and was baptized.   I was ordained a Teacher. I was al-  ways sorry that I was not a Deacon   first; for I had a desire to bear the   Priesthood in its various degrees, as far   as I was worthy. I had had a desire   for years, not only to hear the Gospel,   but to have the privilege and power of   preaching it to my fellow men. I was   a miller by trade, and I spent many a   midnight hour in the mill calling upon   the Lord for light and truth, and pray-  ing that I might hear the Gospel of   Christ and be able to teach it to   my fellow men. I rejoiced in   it when I did receive it. I   afterwards went with Zion's Camp   to Missouri in the spring of   1834, with the Prophet Joseph, his   brother Hyrum, and over two hund-  red of the Saints of God. That was a   great mission to me. I was with the   Prophet. I had read his revelations.   I had read the vision recorded in this   Book of Doctrine and Covenants, and   it had given me more light and more   knowledge with regard to the dealings   of God with men than all the revela-  tions I had ever read, in the Bible or   anywhere else. I had been taught   that there was one heaven and one   hell; and everybody that was not  sprinkled or baptized, infants and all,   would have to go to hell. It made no  difference whether the individual had   committed no wrong, if he had not   been received into the church by   sprinkling or baptism, he would have   to go to hell with the murderer, with   the whoremonger, with the wickedest   of men. On the other hand, every-  body that was sprinkled would go to   heaven. No matter if they had never   made a single sacrifice for the Gospel   of Christ, they would have the same   glory as Peter, James and John, who   had sacrificed their lives for the   Gospel's sake. That was the kind of   teaching I heard in my boyhood. I   did not believe one word of it then;   and I don't now. But this vision of  which I speak opened my eyes. It   showed me the power of God and the  righteousness of God in dealing with   the human family. Before I saw   Joseph I said I did not care how old   he was, or how young he was, I did   not care how he lookedâ€”whether his   hair was long or short; the man that   advanced that revelation was a prophet   of God. I knew it for myself. I first   met Joseph Smith in the streets of   Kirtland. He had on an old hat, and   a pistol in his hand. Said he, "Brother   Woodruff, I've been out shooting at a   mark, and I wanted to see if   I could hit anything;" and says   he, "Have you any objection   to it?"  "Not at all," says I;   "there is no law against a man shoot-  ing at a mark, that I know   of." He invited me to his   house. He had a wolf skin, which he   wanted me to help him to tan; he wan-  ted it to sit on while driving his wagon   team. Now, many might have said,   "You are a pretty prophet; shooting a  pistol and tanning a wolf skin." Well   we tanned it, and used it while mak-  ing a journey of a thousand miles.   This was my first acquaintance   with the Prophet Joseph. And from that   day until the present, with all the   apostasies that we have had, and with   all the difficulties and afflictions we   have have been called to pass through,   I never saw a moment when I had any   doubt with regard to this work. I   have had no trial about this. While   the people were apostatizing on the   right hand and the left, and while   Apostles were urging me to turn   against the Prophet Joseph, it was no   temptation to me to doubt this work or   to doubt that Joseph Smith was a   prophet of God.    As I have said, while holding the   office of teacher, I went to Missouri in   Zion's Camp. After arriving in Mis-  souri, having gone through many   trials and tribulations, and suffering   from cholera, which caused us to lay   in the grave fifteen of our brethren, we   stayed at brother Lyman Wight's.    While at Lyman Wight's, I attended   council meetings with the Prophet,   with David Whitmer, with Oliver   Cowdery and other leading brethren   of the Church. David Whitmer was   the President of the Stake of Zion.   Brother Joseph reproved him very   sharply, as well as some of the other   brethren, because of their lack in ful-  filling the commandments of God and   doing their duty. While at that   place I had a great desire in my heart to go   and preach the gospel. I went off   one Sunday night by myself into a   hickory grove, several hundred yards  from the settlement, and I asked the   Lord to open the door for me that I   might go and preach the gospel. I   did not want to preach the Gospel for   any honor I might get on this earth;   for I thoroughly understood as far as   a man could in my condition, what a   preacher would have to pass through.   It was not honor, nor wealth, nor gold,   nor silver that I desired; but I   knew this was the gospel of Christ,   revealed to me by the power of God; I   knew this was the Church of Christ; I   knew Joseph Smith was a prophet of   God; and I had a desire that I might   preach that gospel to the nations of the   earth. I asked the Lord to give me   that privilege. The Lord answered   that prayer and said I should have my   desire granted. I got up rejoicing. I   walked about two hundred yards out in   the open road, and when I got into the   road, there stood Judge Higbee. Says   he, "Brother Woodruff, the Lord has   revealed to me that it is your duty to be   ordained to go and preach the gospel."   Says I, "Has He?" "Yes." "Well,"  says I, "if the Lord wants me to preach  the gospel, I am perfectly willing to go  and do that." I did not tell him I had   been praying for this. The conse-  quence was, I attended a council at  Lyman Wight's, and was called and  ordained to the office of a Priest in the  Aaronic Priesthood, while other breth-  ren were ordained Elders. I was  called by Bishop Partridge to go to the  Southern country on a mission. Bishop   Partridge asked me a great many  questions, and I asked him questions.    It was then dangerous for any of our  brethren to go through Jackson Coun-  ty. He wanted me to go to Arkansas,  and the road led square through Jack-  son County. I asked him if we should go  through there (I had a companion with me--an Elder).  Says he, "If you  have got faith to do it, you may; I  haven't." I thought that was a curious  remark from a Bishop. "Well," says  I, "the Lord says we must travel with-  out purse or script; shall we do it?"  Says he, "That is the law of God; if  you have got faith to do it, you can do   it." He said he had hardly got faith  to go into Jackson County.  However,  we started and went through Jack-  son County. We came near los-  ing our lives, and were saved almost by  a miracle. We traveled through Ark-  ansas and other parts.    But I do not want to dwell on these   things. I merely wish to say that I  went out as a Priest, and my compan-  ion as an Elder, and we traveled thou-  sands of miles and had many things  manifested to us. I desire to impress  upon you the fact that it does not make  any difference whether a man is a  Priest or an Apostle, if he magnifies his  calling. A Priest holds the keys of  the ministering of angels. Never in   my life, as an Apostle, as a Seventy,  or as an Elder, have I ever had more  of the protection of the Lord than   while holding the office of a Priest.  The Lord revealed to me, by visions,   by revelations, and by the Holy Spirit,  many things that lay before me.    I was once moved upon to go and  warn old Father Hakeman, living on  Petty-John Creek, Arkansas.  He had  been in Jackson County during the  persecution period. His wife died there.  His family consisted of five sons, all   over six feet tall. Most of them had  been whipped with hickory gads by  mobe, and he went south into Arkan-  sas, taking his sons with him. We  went a good deal out of our way for  the purpose of visiting Father Hake-  man. I had a vision the night pre-  vious, in which was manifested to me  the trouble that lay before us, but that  the Lord would deliver us. We arrived at  his house on Sunday morning. He was  taking breakfast. We had had break-  fast at the place where we stayed over  night. I saw a Book of Mormon on his  shelf. He did not seem to pay any  attention to us or to take any inter-  est in us. I took up the Book of   Mormon, and said, "You have a  very good book here." "Yes," said he,  "but it is a book that came from the  devil." That opened my eyes. He  had been an Elder; he had been in   Zion; he had been persecuted there and  driven out; but I found that he had  apostatized, and he was our enemy.  I saw he would do anything he could  against us. We left him and went to  Brother Hubbard's and stayed with  him three weeks, during which we 
 THE DESERET WEEKLY.    were the nature, powers, duties and   responsibilities of the Priesthood.  Those on whom it is conferred are   measurably responsible for the sal-  vation of the people, and will  be held accountable to the Lord   for the manner in which they use the  authority confided to them.  Business  cares will not stand as an excuse for  not responding to the calls of duty in  connection with the calling of the  Priesthood. We are living in a time   when the love of the world prevails,  and great care has to be taken lest the  callings of the Priesthood be lost sight  of by this feeling. Greater care should  be taken in providing employment for  the people, and means should be  adopted for that purpose. It would   probably be a good thing to have mis-  sionaries called to devote their time to  laboring among the people in Zion,   visiting them at their homes and look-  ing after their spiritual and temporal   welfare. Those who hold the Priest-  hood should refrain from all conduct  that is improper, and should exercise  an influence for peace, acting in all  kindness and brotherly love. It is not  in keeping with the genius of the Gos-  pel to indulge in anger, which leads to  wrong and sometimes breaks up friend-  ships that have existed for years. The   brethren should govern their families   in love, avoiding all forms of harshness.  The instructions and ideas presented  were clear and pointed, and a good  spirit was present in the meeting. 
 MINUTES OF THE GENERAL CONFERENCE.    Peresiding Bishops, under Bishop Edward  Hunterâ€”Carried.    John Banks was nominated as another  of the travelling Bishops, and carried.    Ezra T. Benson, Jedediah M. Grant,  and Orson Hyde, were voted as Agents of  the Perpetual Emigrating Company, to  gather the Poor to this place.    Samuel W. Richards, Willard Snow,  Abraham O. Smoot, Dorr P. Curtis, and  Vincent Shurtleff, were voted to take mis-  sions to England.    Daniel Carn, was voted to take a mis-  sion to Germany.    John Young, was voted to take a mis-  sion to the States, to preach, and gather  up the Saints.    John L. Dunyon, was voted to take a   mission to the States, and preach the  Gospel.    A manifest of the affairs in the Tithing   office were read; also a manifest of the   Perpetual Emigrating Poor Fund Com-  pany.    Adjourned to 10, A. M. Benediction by  George A. Smith.    Tuesday, Sept. 9th, 1851, 10 A. M.    Conference again called to order; sing-  ing by the Choir; prayer by H. G. Sher-  wood, and singing.    The forenoon was occupied by Presi-  dent Young preaching a funeral sermon  on the occasion of the death of brother  Lewis Abbott, was followed in his re-  marks by Elder H. G. Sherwood, Levi  Gifford, John Young, and H. C. Kim-  ball, and benediction by Elder Hyde.    2 O'CLOCK, P. M.    Conference being called to order, and   opened in the usual manner. The Patri-  arch John Smith, said he had been   through the whole scene of persecution,  of mobbing, and murders, from 1832 to  the present time; and alluded to the night  of the murder of Joseph and Hyrum in  Carthage Jail, and called on the people to  pay their tithing, that it may be said of  us, well done good and faithful servants;  and was followed in similar remarks by  President Kimball, Edward Hunter, W.   W. Phelps, Isaac Chase, and Zera Pulsi-  pher.    The Patriarch again arose to speak on  the Word of Wisdom, and urging on the  brethren to leave off using tobacco, &c.    President Young rose to put the mo-  tion and called on all the sisters who will  leave off the use of tea, coffee, &c., to  manifest it by raising the right hand;  seconded and carried.    And then put the following motion;  calling on all the boys who were under  ninety years of age who would covenant  to leave off the use of tobacco, whisky,  and all things mentioned in the Word of   Wisdom, to manifest it in the same man-  ner, which was carried unanimously.    The Patriarch then said, may the Lord  bless you and help you to keep all your  covenants.  Amen.    President Young amongst other things  said he knew the goodness of the people,  and the Lord bears with our weakness;  we must serve the Lord, and those who  go with me will keep the Word of Wis-  dom, and if the High Priests, the Seven-  ties, the Elders, and others will not serve   the Lord, we will sever them from the  Church. I will draw the line and know  who is for the Lord and who is not, and  those who will not keep the Word of   Wisdom, I will cut off from the Church;  I throw out a challenge to all men and   women. Have I not always counselled   you right? I would rather you would   cut me into inch pieces, than to flinch  from my duty, the Lord being my helper.   I would rather live with a few men who  will serve the Lord, than live with ten  thousand hypocrites. He then exhorted  the men and women never to quarrel,   to cease all contentions. If a man abuses  you, settle with him with kind words, but  never go to law. Let every head of a   family father their family together night  and morning, and wait on the Lord until  his Spirit rests on you like a cloud, and   I say unto you in the name of the Lord  God of Israel, be you blest.    Adjourned until Wednesday, at ten  o'clock, A. M.    Benediction by George A. Smith.    Wednesday, Sept. 10th, 10 o'clock, A. M.    Conference called to order, and was   opened with singing by the Choir.    Prayer by President Young, and sing-  ing.    E. D. Wooley bore testimony of the   work of the Lord, that Joseph was a Pro-  phet of God, and that Brigham is just as   good a man as Joseph was, and he was as   good a man as ever lived on the earth,  &c.    President Young spoke on the subject   of the Mormon Battalion, and why they 
 place. He held the keys of the   Kingdom of God. It was for him  to have association with God the   Father and with His Son Jesus  Christ, and to lead Israel. You  know what he has done. It is be-  fore you. He has filled these moun-  tains of Israel with cities and   towns and villages. He performed  a great work. God was with him.   He was true and faithful. He was   one of the first Quorum of Apos-  tles. He never varied; he never   shrank from duty. He stood by the  Prophet Joseph while he lived. He  stood by the Kingdom of God and  by the Lord as long as he   lived himself. After his death,   Brother Taylor took his place; and   when he passed away it fell upon  me, for a little while. It is my duty   to have fellowship with God, as  weak an instrument as I am in the  hands of God. It is my duty to  have power with God. And when   I have this, then my counsel-  ors should stand by me and with  me. We should be of one heart and   mind in all matters, temporal and  spiritual, that come before us in the  labor of the Church and Kingdom of  God. And I am thankful to say   that this has been the case since I   have been called to this position, or   since the organization of the Presi-  dency of the Church. Standing con-  nected with us here are the Twelve  Apostles. It is their duty to be of  one heart and one mind. They   have no right to be otherwise. They  cannot be otherwise and prosper be-  fore God. They should be one with   us, and we one with them. They  have their rights; they have their   agency. But when the Presidency  of the Church say unto any of them,   "This is the word of the Lord," or,   "This is right," they should take  hold and work with us. The law of  God requires this union at our  hands. It is the duty of the Seven-  ties, also, to be united with the   Twelve Apostles. The Seventies   are called upon by the Apostles to  go forth and labor in the vineyard of   the Lord, and they work together.    So, brethren and sisters, with   every organization in this Church.   There should be union. There   should be no discord, no dis-  union. If there is, the Lord   is not pleased with it, and we are  hindered in our work. I want all  the Quorums to understand this.   The lesser Priesthood should be unit-  ed. Here is Bishop Preston. He   stands at the head of the Aaronic  Priesthood. He has got counselors.    They should be united together.    They should be united with the less-  er Priesthood, and they should la-  bor to promote their inter-  est and welfare. I have no fault to  find with the brethren in these   matters. I mention these things as   duties devolving upon us.    Now, brethren and sisters, we   should all be united. Unless we are   one, we are not the Lord's. I wish  to exhort the Latter-day Saints to  observe this principle. Our aim is  high. What is that aim? It is the  Celestial Kingdom of ourGod. We  have been called out of the world,   from almost all nations under heav-  en, in fulfilment of the revelations   of God. We have been called  unto these mountains of Israel. We   are fulfilling revelations that were  given thousands of years ago. The   eyes of Jeremiah, of Ezekiel, of   Daniel, of Isaiah and of the ancient   Patriarchs and Prophets beheld our  day. They saw our Zion. They  saw our temples and our tabernacle,   built "for a shadow in the daytime  from the heat, and for a place of ref-  uge, and for a covert from storm and   from rain." [##Isaiah 4:6##]    Brethren and sisters, let us look   at these things as they are. What is  this world? Our lives here are tem-  porary; they are of short duration.  We are here upon a mission. This   people have been called together  from almost every nation under  heaven. They have gathered hereâ€”  a little handful out of fourteen hun-  dred millions of the human family.    Do you suppose the eyes of the  Lord have been withdrawn from   this people? Have the eyes of the   heavenly host been withdrawn? No;  they are watching over us with   feelings of the deepest interest.    They know where we stand. Why   do we have this warfare that we are  passing through? Because it is the  Church and Kingdom of God; be-  cause we are the people of God.   No man can live godly in Christ  Jesus without suffering persecution.    This is your legacy. It is the legacy   of all the Saints of God in every  age of the world. Therefore, I say   to the Latter-day Saints, let your   hearts be comforted. All is right in  Israel, as far as we make it right,  and as far as we do our duty.    I listened yesterday to the reports  made by the Bishops and others.    No doubt there is room for improve-  ment in Logan. There is room for a   great deal of improvement in Salt  Lake City. There is room for im-  provement throughout these moun-  tains. These Elders of Israel who  bear the Holy Priesthood should  prize their standing enough to never  permit themselves to go to these   saloons and drink with the drunken,   or to pursue a course whereby they  lose the Spirit of God. Brethren, if  you do this, you will be sorry for it;   and you will have to repent of these   sins and turn from them, in order to  get forgiveness before the Lord. I   know that this is the kingdom of  God. I know this is the people  whom He has raised up. They   have been kept, as I have often said,  in the Spirit world the last six thou-  sand years, to come forth and stand  in the flesh in this day and build   up this Church and kingdom and   warn this generation of the judg-  ments which await them. We  occupy this position before the Lord.   Then let us not betray our trust.    As the Lord said to the Prophet   Joseph, in answer to his prayer   while in Liberty jail:    "Behold, there are many called, but  few are chosen. And why are they  not chosen?    "Because their hearts are set so   much upon the things of this world,  and aspire to the honors of men, that   they do not learn this one lessonâ€”    "That the rights of the Priesthood  are inseparably connected with the  powers of heaven, and that the powers  of heaven cannot be controlled nor  handled only upon the principles of  righteousness." [##Doctrine and Covenants 121:34-36##]    There is not a man that breathes   the breath of life today on the earth,  who holds and honors that Priest-  hood, but has power with the  heavens, and he can go before the   Lord and have his prayers heard   and answered. This is what the   Latter-day Saints should do. We  should live in that way and manner   that we can go before the Lord and  ask for those blessings, in faith and   in power, that we need to sustain us  to carry out the purposes of God   here in the mountains of Israel.    This is necessary for our advance-  ment. We live in a fast age.    Events are hastening on, and the   Lord is going to cut His work short   in righteousness, lest no flesh should  be saved. No matter about our   persecutions; no matter about the  advantages our enemies may have  from a political or temporal point of   view. God holds your destinies,  He holds the destinies of this nation   and of all men in His own hands.    He governs and controls them. And   His angels are ready and waiting to   go forth and reap down the earth.    But the Lord will fulfil His promi-  ses. Do not be discouraged, there-  fore, with regard to these things.  But we have got to be humble. We  have got to be prayerful. We have  got to have faith in God, and to be  united, and carry out those princi-  ples which the Lord requires at our  hands. All the organizations of the  Priesthood have power. The  Deacon has power, through the  Priesthood which he holds. So has   the Teacher. They have power to  go before the Lord and have their   prayers heard and answered, as well   as the Prophet, the Seer, or the  Revelator has. It is by this Priest-  hood that the work of God has been  accomplished. It is by this Priest-  hood that men have ordinances  conferred upon them, that their sins   are forgiven, and that they are re-  deemed. For this purpose it has   been revealed and sealed upon our   heads.    Brethren and sisters, these are a   few of the thoughts I have upon my  mind. There is a union that God  requires of every quorum in this  Church, from the Presidency down;  and when we set up our will and   our views against those of our breth-  ren, we want to be careful what we   are doing. We should all do the   will of God, laboring for light, for   truth and for those things that we  stand in need of. Speaking of the  love of the Saints of God, no man  knows the love that men bear one  another who hold the Holy Priest-  hood. It is above the love of women.    Why, when I traveled abroad alone,   on my early missions, I would have  done almost anything to have met a  Mormon Elder. It was worth more  than gold to me to meet anybody  that was in the Church. Our breth-  ren hereâ€”Brothers Cannon and   Snow and othersâ€”were called in  early days, before they received the   Apostleship, to go upon missions.   They went forth and proved them-  selves before heaven and earth. The   Lord knows these men. They have  been called by revelation. We   should all be careful not to hurt the  tender vine, nor to hurt one another.   Love one another, sustain one an-

 other; and while we do live in the flesh  let us do our duty.    Our reward is on the other side of  the veil. No matter whether a man  is rich or poor here. Riches are   dangerous. It is better to be poor   than rich. If a man gets riches   enough to damn him, it is the worst   calamity that can come upon him.   As one said anciently, "Give me   neither poverty nor riches." Many   of us have traveled a great many   years in the vineyard of the Lord,  trying to save the souls of men and  to lay up treasures in heaven. Thou-  sands have been redeemed in these  temples. You have one here in   Logan. We have been called as   Saviors upon Mount Zion, while the  kingdom has been the Lord's. These   are glorious principles. To be saved   ourselves, and to save our fellow-  men, what a glorious thing! What   is gold and silver; what are the  riches of this world? They all  perish with the using. We pass   away and leave them. But if we  have eternal life, if we keep the  faith and overcome, we shall rejoice  when we go upon the other side of   the veil. I rejoice in all these   things. There is hardly any princi-  ple the Lord has revealed that I   have rejoiced more in than in the   redemption of our dead; that we will   have our fathers, our mothers, our  wives and our children with us in  the family organization, in the  morning of the first resurrection and   in the Celestial Kingdom. These are   grand principles. They are worth   every sacrifice. When we get home   with God and with the Prophets and   Apostles we will rejoice exceedingly.  "Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard,   neither have entered into the heart  of man, the things which God hath   prepared for them that love Him."    Brethren and sisters, am I glad to   meet with you, and to have the  privilege of bearing my testimony.   This is the Church of God. The   Lord has a good people hereâ€”the  sons and daughters of Abraham,   whose lives have been hid with  Christ in God, and you have known   it not. The Priesthood has been  handed down from Father Abra-  ham, through the lineage of our   forefathers, unto us in this last dis-  pensation and fulness of times.  Then let us be true and faithful; let   us honor God; let us try to keep His   commandments; let us remember  our prayers and do our duty, and   especially be unitedâ€”united to the  Lord, united to the Holy Ghost,   united to one another, that we may  carry out the principles in our day  and time; which may God grant,   for Christ's sake. Amen. 
 Spanish Fork  Oct. 30, 1895    President Wilford Woodruff.    Dear Brother  In answer to yours of 24th, inst,   will say that I intend to be  present at the Historian's Office  on the 15th. of Nov, to be set  apart for a mission to the  Eastern States, having accepted  of the call that has been made  upon me.

 Paris Idaho  Dec 17th 1895    President W Woodruff.   Salt Lake City.    Dear Bro    I received your letter of the 14th per Bro Reynolds,   this morning, in relation to Bro Herbert Horsley, and by the  same mail came Bro Horsley himself with a letter from his  Bishop.    Bro Horsley manifested a very good disposition, and  I believe he is now under the influence of the right spirit,   and I have considerable confidence that he will do a good work.   He is an old friend of mine, and we had a confidential conver-  sation which resulted in withdrawing any objection on my part  to his going on his mission.    I told him that the information the Presidency acted  upon was sent by me, and why I felt under an obligation to send it.   He did not dispute what I had heard. I had in the meantime  sent for his Bro Thos Horsley, my informant, not knowing but Herbr  Herbert might request my authority, but he did not, and I of-  course let it rest not wishing to have possible trouble.    Bro Horsley has not been slandered. The Bishops letters  do not defend him, or justify him, only as to his present  desires, all from good feelings on their part, as they think with  all his friends that this mission is a turning point in Bro  Horsleys life, and I have better hopes today for him than I  have had for many years. I believe this check has been a blessing  to him, and he went away feeling first-rate.    I make a somewhat lengthy statement, as I do not wish to be  considered too particular, and if I told you how long we have 
 INDIVIDUAL AGGRANDIZEMENT.    went the journey. General Doniphan  said in St. Louis, that, "if he had one   thousand Mormon Boys, the same as the   Mormon Battalion, he could do more  good than all the United States soldiers  that were there:" I say, if he had been  a Mormon he would have been charged  with treason, although the government  is good, and the Constitution is as good as  could be framed.    He then exhorted the Presiding Bishop  to settle with the First Presidency and   all the Bishops, and require their tithing,   the one-tenth of all their real estate, of  the value of their farms and possessions,  and all they have got, and then see that  the Bishops settle with every man, and   that he pays his tithing or we will disfel-  lowship him from the Church. I will   sell every particle of my property if a man  can be found who will pay the cash, and  I will put it all into the hands of Bishop  Hunter, and I will begin anew, and in  five years God will so bless me that I  shall be richer than any man in this   community.    He then called on the First Presidency,  the Twelve Apostles, High Priests, Seven-  ties, and every person to know if they were  willing to do as he told them, when all  hands were immediately raised.    He lifted his hands on high and with  all the powers of the Holy Priesthood  vested in him, he blessed the Saints in the  name of the Lord God of Israel, when all  the people cried, Amen.    On motion the Conference was ad-  journed to the 6th October next, at ten  o'clock, A. M.    Benediction by President H. C. Kim-  ball.  THOMAS BULLOCK,  Clerk of Conference.

 Farmington  Oct 1st, 1895    Prest. Wilford Woodruff    Dear Brother  I received you letter of 26th ^Inst^ calling  me on a mMission to Turkey and  being Desireous ar repsponding to all   calls made of me by those in  authority over me I accept with  pleasure the honor confered up  on me as being counted worthy  to carry the Gospel to the nations  of the earth and will say that  I will be ready at the 
 of paying that off and   providing for my family  having a Wife and eight  children none of the chil-  dren being old enough to   help along.  my income  is what I can earn as a   Carpenter.  I dont want you   to think that in writing thus   I am complaining for I real-  ize that I am and have   been greatly blessed in ma-  ny ways but I wish to  lay my affairs before you   plainly I am also an exec-  utor to an estate which can   not be settled up for nearly   two years.    hoping to hear from you   soon I remain your brother   in the Gospel    William. A. Wetzel 
 Wm A. Dewey  Feb. 1895.    it seams imposable but  if you see fit    I remain as ever your  willing Brother in  the work of Christ    Wm. A. Dewey    What Bro Dewey has said   I believe to be trueâ€” in fact  the condition of his wife  necessetates his keeping  pretty close arround home.   Outside of these considerations  this ward would be badly  crippled without his assistance.  as explaned before there are   two branches to be looked   after and in his absence  there would never be a quorum 
 and Covenants. It will pay any man  to do what is right and to keep the  commandments of God. This Priesthood  has power on the earth; and when  those holding this Priesthood go before  the Lord and pray to Him, He will  hear them and answer their prayers.  This, brethren and sisters, is where our  power lies. It is with God, not with  man. He has heard us in the past, and  we have been preserved and protected  until the present time. We still live,  notwithstanding all the exertions that  have been made for our destruction.  We live in these valleys of the moun-  tains, and if we will do our duty we  shall live here. I want our young  people and their parents to listen to the  counsels that have been given  concerning the Sabbath schools,  the Mutual Improvement Associa-  tions and the Primaries. We are held  responsible for the sons and daughters  that have been given us. I meet with  sons of President Kimball, with sons  of President Young, with sons of  President Taylor, and with sons of  Apostles who have passed away. I re-  joice when I meet them. Their fathers  helped lay the foundation of this work.  They labored to promote the interests  and welfare of Zion. I rejoice to see  their posterity on the earth. I hope all  these young men bear a portion of the  Priesthood, and that they will magnify  their callings. The eyes of their  fathers who dwell in the spirit world,  are over them. Their bodies are in  the tomb; but their spirits are  awake. They are mingling with  the righteous. And they have an  anxiety about the welfare of their  children here. I am anxious myself  to have the rising generation take hold  of this work; and I hope we will not  disappoint our Heavenly Father. We  should read and study these revelations  of God and lay them to heart, and in-  asmuch as we do this, they will prove  of profit unto us.    Brethren and sisters, I am glad to  meet with you, and to bear my testi-  mony to you of the Gospel of Christ.  As I have often said, I have lived to  more than the allotted age of man.  I have lived while most everybody  with whom I was acquainted in Kirt-  land and Nauvoo has passed to the  other side of the veil. I expect to go  there myself, the same as the rest of  my brethren. But while I live I want  to be true and faithful to my God and  to the Saints. One of the greatest  blessings of God to me has been the  fact that myself and counselors live in  the hearts of the Latter-day Saints, and  I have felt to be humbled in the dust  before the Lord for this. We know  that you pray for us. We know that  you have respect for us. And we live  upon this principle. God has led this  Church from the beginning, by  prophets and inspired men. He  will lead this Church until the  scene is wound up. He will neither  permit me nor any other man to lead  this Church astray. If I turn from  the commandments of God and at-  tempt to lead the people astray, the  Lord will remove me out of my place  for the Lord has set His hand to lead  this people by revelation and by in-   spired men. The Lord has "chosen  the weak things of the world to con-  found the things which are mighty;  * * and things which are not,  to bring to nought things that are."    We feel our weaknesses. I wish my-  self that I were a better man than  I am. Of course, I have endeavored to  do about the best I could in my weak  way. I still wish to do so. But I am  dependent upon the Lord and upon  the prayers of the Saints, the same as  my brethren. I pray God to bless you   and me. I pray that He will seal upon  the hearts of the Saints of God the  teachings that we have heard during  this conference. This is my prayer in  the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

 THE DESERET NEWS.    The Deseret News.  TRUTH AND LIBERTY  GEORGE Q. CANNON --- EDITOR  Wednesday,  Apr. 8, 1868.    THIRTY-EIGHTH   GENERAL CONFERENCE.    Elder Wilford Woodruff spoke of the  work to be performed in this dispensa-  tion by the people of God, and the pri-  vileges bestowed upon them, compared  with the labors required of and the pri-  vileges bestowed upon the people of  preceding dispensations. Seeing the  greatness of the work to be performed,  the question which every Latter-day  Saint should ask himself is, "What can   I do to advance the purposes of God."    The Lord has declared by His prophets  in all preceding dispensations, that in  this one He will redeem the earth from  the power of Satan, and set up His  kingdom never more to be thrown   down. We are engaged in that work,   and we should seek diligently to per-  form our duties in connection there-  with, and fulfil the purposes of the   Lord.

 604 THE DESERET NEWS. Oct 10    Prest. Wilford Woodruff then ad-  dressed the Conference. Said it  gave him great pleasure to meet   with so many of the young men  and women of Zion. Made some very   interesting remarks about the early   days of the Church. Prophesied   that the day was near at hand when   the vail would be raised, and the  minds of the young men and women   would be filled with the spirit of the  work. The day would come when   the cities of the Saints would not   have saloons, because the Saints   would not support them. Admon-  ished the young men to refrain from   all evil ways and forsake all evil   practices.

 THE DESERET WEEKLY.    President Wilford Woodruff  I want to say to all Israel that the   step which I have taken in issuing   this manifesto has not been done   without earnest prayer before the   Lord. I am about to go into the   spirit world, like other men of my   age. I expect to meet the face of   my Heavenly Father â€“ the Father   of my spirit; I expect to meet the   face of Joseph Smith, of Brigham   Young, of John Taylor, and of the   Apostles, and for me to have taken   a stand in anything which is not   pleasing in the sight of God, or be-  fore the heavens, I would rather   have gone out and been shot. My   life is no better than other men's.   I am not ignorant of the feelings   that have been engendered through   the course I have pursued. But I   have done my duty, and the nation   of which we form a part must be   responsible for that which has been   done in relation to this principle.    The Lord has required at our   hands many things that we have not  done, many things that we were  prevented from doing. The Lord   required us to build a Temple in   Jackson County. We were pre-  vented by violence from doing   it. He required us to build a   Temple in Far West, which   we have not been able to do.   A great many things have been re-  quired of us, and we have not been   able to do them, because of those   that surrounded us in the world.   This people are in the hands of God.   This work is in the hands of God,   and He will take care of it. Brother   George Q. Cannon told us about the   lies that are abroad. It is a time   when there have been more lies   told about Mormonism than almost   any other subject ever presented to   the human family. I often think   of what Lorenzo Dow said with re-  gard to the doctrine of election.   Says he: "It is like this: You can,   and you can't; you will, and   you won't; you shall, and you   shan't; you'll be damned if   you do, and you'll be damned   if you don't." That is about the   condition we as Latter-day Saints   are in. If we were to undertake to   please the world, and that was our   object, we might as well give up the   ship; we might have given it up in   the beginning. But the Lord has   called us to labor in the vineyard;   and when our nations passes laws, as   they have done, in regard to this   principle which we have presented   to the Conference, it is not wisdom   for us to make war upon sixty-five   millions of people. It is not wisdom   for us to go forth and carry out this   principle against the laws of the na-  tion and receive the consequences.   That is in the hands of God, and   He will govern and control it. The   Church of Christ is here; the Zion   of God is here, in fulfilment of these   revelations of God that are con-  tained in these holy records in   which the whole Christian world   profess to believe. The Bible could   never have been fulfilled had it not   been for the raising up of a prophet   in the last days. The revelations of   St. John could never have been   fulfilled if the angel of God   had not flown through the   midst of heaven, "having the   everlasting Gospel to preach   to them that dwell on the earth,   and to every nation, and kindred,   and tongue, and people, saying with   a loud voice, Fear God, and give   glory to Him; for the hour of His   judgment is come." Was that angel   going to visit New York, Philadel-  phia, Boston, and the world, and   call the people together and preach   to them? Not at all. But the Lord   raised up a Prophet. The angel of   God delivered that Gospel to that   Prophet. That Prophet organized a   Church; and all that He has prom-  ised in this code of revelations (the   Book of Doctrine and Covenants)   has been fulfilled as fast as time   would admit. That which is not   yet fulfilled will be.    Brethren and sisters, it is our duty   to be true to God and to be faithful.   Make your prayers known unto the   Lord. The Lord has told us what   He will do concerning many things.   He will fulfill His word. Let us be   careful and wise, and let us be satis-  fied with the dealings of God with   us.  If we do our duty to one an-  other, to our country and to the   Church of Christ, we will be justi-  fied when we go into the spirit   world. It is not the first   time that the world has sought to   hinder the fulfillment of revelation   and prophecy. The Jewish nation   and other nations rose up and slew   the Son of God and every Apostle   but one that bore the Priesthood in   that day and generation. They   could not establish the kingdom;   the world was against them. When   the Apostles asked Jesus whether   He would at that time restore again   the kingdom of Israel, He replied:   "It is not for you to know the times   or the seasons, which the Father   hath put in his own power." He   did not say it would be established   then; but He taught them to pray:   "Our Father which art in heaven,   Hallowed be thy name. Thy king-  dom come. Thy will be done on   earth, as it is in heaven." It is a   long time since that prayer was   offered, and it has not been fulfilled   until the present generation. The   Lord is preparing a people to receive   His kingdom and His Church, and   to build up His work. That, breth-  ren and sisters, is our labor.    I want the prayers of the Latter-  day Saints. I thank God that I   have seen with my eyes this day   that this people have been ready to   vote to sustain me in an action that   I know, in one sense, has pained   their hearts. Brother George Q.   Cannon has laid before you our   position. The Lord has given us   commandments concerning many   things, and we have carried them   out as far as we could; but when   we cannot do it, we are justified.   The Lord does not require at our   hands things that we cannot do.    This is all I want to say to the   Latter-day Saints upon this subject.   But go before the Lord and ask Him   for light and truth, and to give us   such blessings as we stand in need   of. Let your prayers ascend into   the ears of the God of Sabaoth, and   they will be heard and answered   upon your heads, and upon the   heads of the world. Our nation is  in the hands of God. He holds  their destiny. He holds the desti-  nies of all men. I will say to the   Latter-day Saints, as an Elder in  Israel and as an Apostle of the Lord  Jesus Christ, we are approaching  some of the most tremendous judg-  ments God ever poured out upon   the world. You watch the signs of   the times, the signs of the coming   of the Son of Man. They are be-  ginning to be made manifest both   in heaven and on earth. As has   been told you by the Apostles, Christ   will not come until these things   come to pass. Jerusalem has got to   be rebuilt. The Temple has got to be   built. Judah has got to be gathered,   and the House of Israel. And the   gentiles will go forth to battle   against Judah and Jerusalem before   the coming of the Son of Man.   These things have been revealed by   the prophets; they will have their   fulfilment. We are approaching these   things. All that the Latter-day   Saints have to do is to be quiet, care-  ful and wise before the Lord, watch   the signs of the times, and be true   and faithful; and when you get   through you will understand many   things that you do not today.  This   work has been raised up by the   power of Almighty God. These El-  ders of Israel were called from the   various occupations of life to preach   as they were moved upon by the   Holy Ghost. They were not learned   men; they were the weak things of   this world, whom God chose to con-  found the wise, "and things which   are not, to bring to nought things   that are." We are here on that   principle. Others will be gathered   on that principle.  Zion will be   redeemed, Zion will arise, and   the glory of God will rest   upon her, and all that Isaiah and   the other prophets have spoken con-  cerning her will come to pass. We   are in the last dispensation and   fulness of time. It is a great day,   and the eyes of all the heavens are   over us and the eyes of God Him-  self and all the patriarchs and pro-  phets. They are watching over you   with feelings of deep interest, for   your welfare; and our prophets who   were slain and sealed their testimony   with their blood, are mingling with   the Gods, pleading for their brethren.   Therefore, let us be faithful, and 
 Such are my circumstances at the present  time, but I never wish to shirk a duty  and if, knowing my situation, you wish  me to go I stand ready and willing to  perform to the best of my poor ability  that which is required at my hands, the  Lord being my helper.    Your brother in the gospel  William Reast.    I fear Bp. Stratford is right.    If bro. Reast cannot afford  to go on a mission as other  Elders do who are called,  he had better be excused,  until he is able to do so.  Therefore I suggest he have  time given him to prepare  him self for a mission and  when he feels able to go he  can so notify us.  J. F. S.    Ogden Sep 30 [18]95    Prest Woodruff    Dear Bro  In reference to enclosed letter of  Bro Wm Reast will say the Bishop  ric are of the opinion that Bro  Reast is able to fill the mission  to which he has been called without  calling upon the ward to support  his wife's parents But he notified  the Bishop that if he went the  ward would have to support them  and that he would also need  help himself on his mission  We know he has money loaned  out at interest and has only  an adopted child and a wife  to provide for besides the old  people refered too and they have  other relatives here who can look  after them.

 DISCOURSE   Delivered by President Wilford Woodruff,  Sunday Morning, October 9th, 1892,  at the Semi-Annual Conference, held  in the Tabernacle, Salt Lake City,  Utah.    I feel disposed to try to address this  assembly of Latter-day Saints for  awhile this morning; but I wish to say  that I need not only the strict atten-  tion but the faith and prayers of the  Saints of God, for no man can fill the  place which I or these Apostles occupy,  to fulfil the command of God and the  requirements of the Latter-day Saints,  except by the inspiration of Almighty  God. This is a truth that has remained  on the earth from the day of Father  Adam to this hour.    I have some things upon my mind I  would like to lay before this assembly  if I can get sufficient of the spirit of  inspiration to do it. To commence  with, I want to bear my testimony to  these Latter-day Saints and to the  world that I am held responsible be-  fore God, the angels and the heavenly  hosts for the testimony which I bear  before you; and so is every man who  bears record of the Son of God and of  the work of God in this or any other  generation. These Latter-day Saints  bear record to the world, and have  borne record for almost a generation  past, that Joseph Smith was a Prophet  of God; that they know this work is of  God, and hat this is the Church of  Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.   They are held responsible for this, and  if they bear a true testimony, the na-  tions of the earth who hear that testi-  mony will be held responsible for the  use they make of it. Do you ask me  how I know this is the work of God,  and that Joseph Smith is a Prophet  of God? I will tell you how  I know. I know it by the revelations  of Jesus Christ and by the inspiration  of the Lord. If I may be allowed to  refer to myself without being consider-  ed egotistical, I will tell you why I  bear this testimony.    Eighty-five years have passed over  my head since I first tabernacled in  the flesh. Almost sixty years of that  period I have been a member of the  Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day  Saints. During that time I have borne  some portion of the Holy Priesthood,  and for fifty-three years I have occu-  pied the position of the Apostleship, in  connection with my brethren. I have  also traveled abroad and at home.  I  have been taught from my childhood up by the revelations of God in the records of divine truth that have been given to us, that there is one God, and that there is one Jesus Christ, who is the Savior of the world, and the only Savior pertaining to this world and to the redemption thereof. I have been taught that there is one Priesthood, in its two divisions. I have been taught that there is one Holy Ghost, and that there is one Gospel and one set of ordinances for the salvation of the whole posterity of Adam, and only one. I have been taught that these ordinances are the same in every age of the world. Whoever reads the New Testament can see the testimony of the Apostles that there was but one Gospel in that day and generation; and that Gospel was taught by Adam himself to his posterity. The same Gospel was taught by Moses, and by all the patriarchs and prophets down to the days of Jesus Christ. There was but the one Gospel. But the promise was that whoever received that Gospel should receive the Holy Ghost and the gifts thereof, and these gifts were made manifest from generation to generation when the God of heaven had a people on the face of the earth.    In traveling during these sixty years that I have been in the Church, abroad and at home, I have been associated with the Elders of Israel in the administration of these ordinances to the human family. What has been the result? Remember now what I told you, that I am held responsible for my testimony. I have traveled, I may say, in the midst of visions, in the midst of the administration of angels, in the midst of the power of God. In connection with my brethren, I have laid hands upon the sick, and they have recovered. We have laid hands upon the blind, and they have seen; upon the deaf, and they have heard; upon the lame, and they have walked; upon those possessed with devils, and they were cast out; and even unto the resurrection of the dead. Those gifts and graces that have followed the servants of God in every age of the world have been associated with this Church from the day of its organization until this hour. These are truths in the sight of high heaven, and I will meet them there when I go to the other side of the veil. Therefore, if there are any strangers here, I bear testimony to these things, for I know they are true. The inspiration of the Holy Ghost deceives no man, and when any people receive this Gospel and this Priesthood, they know for themselves whether the work is of God or not. Yes, we lay hands upon the sick, and while we do so, the Spirit and power of God comes upon us, from the crown of our head to the soles of our feet. We lay hands upon men to ordain them to the Priesthood, and the power of God rests upon the men who administer. These thirty thousand Elders who dwell here in the mountains of Israel, when they go to the nations of the earth and get up and declare the Gospel of Jesus Christ to the world, the Holy Ghost is with them. They bear a testimony that rejoices the hearts of men, and men receive that testimony, and everything they promise them is fulfilled to the very letter.    This is the reason why I know that Joseph Smith was a Prophet of God, and that this is the Church of God on the earth. And I wish many times that I had power to express to the Latter-day Saints what is in my heart, and what the vision of my mind opens unto me in those seasons when I am inspired with the Spirit and power of God to see what lies before this people and before this generation. Oh! ye Latter-day Saints, you talk about revelation, and wonder if there is any revelation. Why, bless your souls, say nothing about the Apostles and Elders around me, these mountains contain thousands upon thousands of devoted women, holy women, righteous women, virtuous women, who are filled with the inspiration of Almighty God. Yes, these women have brought forth an army of sons and daughters in these mountains by the power of God, and these sons and daughters partake of the inspiration of their mothers, as well as of their fathers. I will ask you, what are these Apostles doing when they rise up and preach to you?  What are these Elders of Israel doing when they bear record here to the Latter-day Saints and to the world, if they have not inspiration and revelation? There is not a man on the footstool of God Almighty today who has power to preach the Gospel and testify to its truth, only by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost. Yes, we have revelation. The Church of God could not live twenty-four hours without revelation. We do not have as much as we ought to have; and when I look at the work that has been piled up for these Latter-day Saints to bear off in the world, I feel as though we need a good deal of

 APOSTLE WOODRUFF  felt moved upon to speak a few  words to the Conference, by bearing  his testimony to what John had just  finished saying, as also to what Can-  non had promulgated as Gospel in  the forenoon, for they were oracles of  God, and it was not the privilege of  one man alone to have revelation, but  it was the duty of all the Saints to be  full of revelation, so that they might   walk through life with the light of  the Holy Spirit shining on their path.  It was the duty of those who should  charter ships for the emigration of the  Saints to have it; it was the duty of  Brother John D. T. McAllister, to  be filled with the spirit of revelation  every day in the St. George Temple,  so that he could prevent any man  from robbing another of his dead  wives. The Prophet Joe Smith bap-  tized thousands before he kept any  record of the baptisms. But he did  not know it all. For twenty years  the endowments had been given in a   little house in the Temple block, but  the whole light had not been revealed  then. Only after the St. George   Temple was completed did the Lord  let the priesthood into  THE WHOLE SECRET.  Then he showed the Prophet   Brigham many new things, as also  the preacher, Woodruff. There were  about twenty men and twenty women  administering the holy ordinance in  the St. George temple, all for no-  thing and boarding themselves. Far  be it from the Apostles to make mer-  chandise of the gifts and blessings of  God, but the brethren and sisters  must live by eating, and therefore  the many who are intending to go  through the temple from this time  forward, must take along their tem-  ple offerings to lay upon the altar.  As to tithing, take hold and go to,  now, said the preacher, and pay what   you owe.    THERE'S MILLIONS IN IT!  Your dead will be after you in  tones of ten thousand thunders if you  don't, because they are interested in  this great work. And now, our sis-  ters, God bless them forever, said  Wilford, let them go too and lay up  the wheat while it is cheap, for the  great famine which is coming upon  the world. "Somehow or 'nother,  the brethring have got an idle [idea] in  their heads, that there ain't agoin' to  be no famin, but there is; the Lord  has said so, and the Lord don't lie,  for he's agoin' to pour out the [whole]  of his wrath upon the wicked, and  spread war and [destruction] among   the nations of the earth with fire and   sword and pestilence and famine on  every hand, and lay up your wheat,  brethring. Plant out mulberry  trees instead of these nasty,  rotten cottonwoods, and use 'em  too, and listen to the counsels of the  holy priesthood, and manufacture  everything we need so that if the  Latter-day Saints are cut off from  the rest of the world they can be in-  dependent, for Babylon is going to  fall; the Lord has said so, and  THE LORD DON'T LIE,  and support our own publications,  especially the Woman's Exponent for  the sisters on it are doing a noble  work." Here the Apostle caught his   breath and subsided. 
 THE DESERET WEEKLY.    President Wilford Woodruff.  then addressed the congregation. In  the year 1833 he had heard the first  Gospel sermon. In the first year after  having embraced the Gospel, he had  held the office of a Teacher. In the   second year he was ordained a Priest.  The following year he became an Elder  and the next he was ordained a mem-  ber of the quorum of Seventies. For  about fifty-two years he had been a   member of the quorum of the Twelve.    The speaker would say that during  this time, he had endeavored to preach  the Gospel to the world, and in so do-  ing had traveled enough to go round  the world six times, yet he had not  tried to preach or to minister in the   ordinances of the Kingdom of God,   except by the power of Jesus Christ.   And now after having labored so many  years he felt still as much dependent   on the Holy Spirit as ever, and on the   faith and prayers of the Saints. There  never was a Prophet on the earth who  could instruct the children of men ex-  cept by the power of the Priesthood.    The speaker then very strongly re-  futed some of the slanders that have  been hurled against the people of God,   even by prominent men who have  visited the Territory. He made an  eloquent appeal for liberty of con-  science. The Latter-day Saints accord  to all men freedom to worship God ac-  cording to the dictates of their con-  sciences, and we ask for ourselves only  what we are willing should be enjoyed  by others. The speaker wished the  blessings of God to rest abundantly on  the Conference, and all the people. 
 PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF  spoke briefly on the subject treated by  Elder Merrill. 
 THE DESERET WEEKLY.    leave events in the hands of God,   and He will take care of us if we do   our duty.    I pray God that He will bless these   Apostles, Prophets and Patriarchs,   these Seventies, High Priests and   Elders of Israel, and these Latter-  day Saints, who have entered into   covenant with our god. You have   a great future before you. You have   kept the commandments of God, so   far as you have had the opportunity,   and by receiving the Gospel of   Christ and being faithful   your reward is before you.   Your history is written and is be-  fore you.  I will say that this nation,   and all nations, together with presi-  dents, kings, emperors, judges, and   all men, righteous and wicked, have   got to go into the spirit world   and stand before the bar of God.   They have got to give an account of   the deeds done in the body. There-  fore, we are safe as long as we do   our duty. No matter what trials or   tribulations we may be called to   pass through, the hand of God will   be with us and will sustain us. I   ask my Heavenly Father to pour   out His Spirit upon me, as His   servant, that in my advanced age,   and during the few days I have to   spend here in the flesh, I may be   led by inspiration of the Al-  mighty. I say to Israel, the Lord   will never permit me nor any other   man who stands as the President of   this Church, to lead you astray.   It is not in the programme. It is   not in the mind of God. If I were   to attempt that, the Lord would   remove me out of my place, and so   He will any other man who at-  tempts to lead the children of men   astray from the oracles of God and   from their duty. God bless you.   Amen. 
 THE DESERET NEWS. --[Apri 13.    The Deseret News.  TRUTH AND LIBERTY.    GEORGE Q. CANNON --- EDITOR  Wednesday, Apr. 13, 1870.    FORTIETH ANNUAL CONFERENCE  OF THE  CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LAT-  TER-DAY SAINTS, APRIL 6, 1870.    ELDER WILFORD WOODRUFF  Spoke. Our religion is God-given, and  were we to relinquish it because of the  fear of man, we would be recreant to   every heaven-born principle. Civil  and religious liberty is the keystone in  the arch of the glorious Constitution   of our country; if that be taken away   the whole fabric must fall to pieces.   This Government is in the hands of   God. My life is of but small conse-  quence when compared with my hopes   of eternal happiness. No power will  put down this work for God is at the   helm and will guide it safely through.  President Young has done and is doing   all in his power to benefit mankind,   thus following in the footsteps of the   prophet Joseph. I pray that we may   be faithful to the holy principles we   have received. Amen. 
 more inspiration and revelation than   we have. We want our souls to be   wide open to the things of God, and   to understand our position and destiny.   I realize, Latter-day Saints require at   my hands, as President of the  Church of Jesus Christ of Lat-  ter-day Saints, many things. They   also require many things at the hands   of my counselors and these Apostles.   We can accomplish what is required   of us if we have the faith and the as-  sistance of the Latter-day Saints and  the power of God; but without that we   can do nothing.    I will say a few words with regard to   another dispensation. The whole   Christian world profess to believe in   the Bible. You look through that   book, and you will not find a single in-  stance of a Prophet, or an Apostle, or   an inspired man going forth to preach   the Gospel except by the power of   the holy and everlasting Priest-  hood. No man has had power   to go forth and administer in the ordi-  nances of salvation without that  Priesthood, from Adam down. Father   Adam was a great High Priest. So   were his sons that were with himâ€”  Seth, Enos, Jared, Canaan, Mahala-  leel, Enoch and Methuselah; and a   great many others bore the holy   Priesthood. [##Doctrine and Covenants 107:53-56##] All that Moses did was   by the power of the holy Priest-  hood. All that Jesus Christ and the Apostles   did was by the power of the Priest-  hood. Jesus Christ was our great   High Priest, and He came into the  world and laid down His life as a great   sacrifice for the redemption of the   world. It is that dispensation that I   wish to say a few words about. It was   rather a peculiar dispensation. The   Savior came to the Jewish nationâ€”to   His ownâ€”through the loins of Abra-  ham, Isaac and Jacob, and David. [##Matthew 1:1-16##] The   Jewish nation rejected Him. He la-  bored until they put Him to death. He   lived only three years and a half   after He entered the ministry. He   lived long enough, however, to   choose twelve Apostles, to organize a   church, to warn that nation, and to   declare unto them what would come   upon their heads. Moses had also told   the Jewish nation of these things in  his day, by the inspiration of the Lord.   Has one jot or title fallen unfulfilled?  Not one. When the Savior suffered   that ignominious death on the cross,  and was about to give up the ghost,   He said, "Father, forgive them, for   they know not what they do." [##Luke 23:34##] Is not   that a strange saying for a man who   was being crucified and about to go  into the spirit world? But Jesus saw  everything that would befall the Jew-  ish nation, and well might He make  such a remark. He saw that one   thousand eight hundred years after   His death this yoke of bondage and   trial and tribulation would rest upon   the posterity of Judah, and he was   ready to forgive them. No, they   did not know what they did.   They did not comprehend it. They   did not understand that they were put-  ting to death their Shilohâ€”the king of   the Jews, their great Redeemer. They   were too overwhelmed with darkness   and iniquity to comprehend this.   But, as I was saying, Jesus chose  twelve Apostles. They were fisher-  men, weak and illiterate. But the   Lord has always chosen the weak   things of this world, instead of the   great, and the learned, and the rich,   and the powerful of the earth. Why   has He done it? That He might have   instruments that He could handleâ€”  men who would obey Him, who   would take His counsel and carry out   His commandments. In preparing   this dispensation in which we live the   Lord has known perfectly well what   lay before us. He has known the   mighty events that were to be heaped  upon the heads of both Jew and   Gentile, Saint and sinner, Zion and   the world; and He has prepared an   element to do this work of His,   which He has gathered here   in the mountains of Israel. But in the   days of the Savior it was a dispensa-  tion of sacrifice; and Jesus Christ and   the Apostles only lived a little while   after they were chosen, to warn the   nation in which they dwelt and that   generation. Jesus Christ was crucified,   the Apostles were put to death, and   most every man who bore the Priest-  hood was slain, excepting John the   Revelator. The Lord had ordained   him to live, and he did not die, but   remains today upon the face of the  earth, in fulfilment of the promises of   God to him. [##John 21:21-23##] But in that day they had   not the privilege of building the Zion   of God or the Kingdom of God. It was   not a dispensation prepared for that.   These men laid down their lives, and   the judgments of God overtook the   Jewish nation, in fulfillment of the pre-  dictions of the Savior and the Pro-  phets. Moses told them in his day,   "And thou shalt eat the fruit of   thine own body, the flesh of thy sons and of  thy daughters, which the Lord thy   God hath given thee, in the siege, and   in the straitness, wherewith thine ene-  mies shall distress thee." [##Deuteronomy 28:53##] All this  came to pass, and the kingdom was   taken from the earth, the holy Priest-  hood was taken up to God, who gave  it, and the Church went into the wil-  derness, and there remained until the  day set for its restoration to the world.    But I want to speak more particularly   about this great and last dispensation,   in which the Lord has said, through   the mouths of all the patriarchs and   prophets, a mighty work should be per-  formed. It is different, my brethren and   sisters, from the days of the Savior.  I  do not believe there ever was a greater   dispensation than the one in which   you and I live, because in it is cen-  tred the fulfillment of all prophecy   and all revelation that has been mani-  fest looking to the final restoration of   all things before the coming of the   Son of Man. I want to speak of our   condition today before the Lord. When   the Savior died He went to preach to   the spirits in prison. Most all the  people from the days of Noah to that  day had died without the Gospel, and   Jesus went and preached to them. [##1 Peter 3:19-20##]   They had this work resting upon   them in that day. In this day and   generation we have in the Bible, the   Book of Mormon and the Doctrine   and Covenants the history of the   Latter-day Saints and of the world.   You are my witnesses today that this  people are here in fulfillment of these   revelations and prophecies. We have   had a Prophet raised up in these last  days, as great a Prophet as ever   breathed the breath of life, save Jesus  Christ, and He was raised up for the  purpose of laying the foundation   of this work. And how is this   dispensation and this work to com-  mence? I would like to have the   Christian world read the revelations of   St. John. There you have before you   a picture of what awaits this genera-  tion. You have there proclaimed that  in the commencement of this great   and last work in the last days an angel   of God would fly through the midst of   heaven, having the everlasting Gospel  to preach to them that dwell on the   earth, "and to every nation, and kin-  dred, and tongue, and people, saying   with a loud voice, Fear God, and give  glory to Him, for the hour of His   judgment is come." [##Revelation 14:6-7##] Yes, ye Latter-  day Saints, the hour of God's judgment  is come." The Lord raised a great   Prophet unto us. He was a mighty   man, although illiterate, in one sense   of the word. The Lord called upon him  to perform this work, and he not only   received the visitation of angels, but   even the voice of God. This is the   only dispensation that I have ever   read of in which the Father and Son   both appeared to the man whom He   had chosen to establish His Church.   Joseph Smith received this great   honor. He was a Prophet of God.   I have traveled with him a good many  miles. Speaking of the gifts and   graces manifested by the Elders of   Israel, I have seen Joseph Smith in  one day go forth among the sick and  command those that were dying to   arise and be made whole, and they   have leaped from their beds, been   clothed, and walked out in the street  and followed the Prophet of God in his   travels through the midst of the Saints   of God. Can I doubt this work? Can   you doubt it? I think not. No man   that has had any experience in this   work can doubt it. You remember   Brother Fordham. He was breath-  ing his last breath of life when  the Prophet took him by the hand   and commanded him in the name of   Jesus of Nazareth to arise and be   made whole. He leaped from his   bed, was clothed, and walked out and  into the house of Brother Joseph  Bates Noble, who is still living in  these mountains. He was also lying  at the point of death and was instantly  healed by the power of God, through   the voice of the Prophet of God. I   name these things because I have had   experience in them and have a right to   mention them. The power of God was  with the Prophet, from the time he   was ordained to the Priesthood until   he was murdered. He lived some four-  teen years after he laid the foundation   of this work. And when he organized   this Church he organized it in its full   power and glory, and every gift and  grace, and every ordinance that   belongs to the Church of God.   Nothing was ever manifest in any   age of the world but what was included   in the organization of this Church. It   was organized with Prophets, with   Apostles, with Pastors, with Teachers,   with helps and governments, with  gifts and graces, and with the Mel-  chisedek and Aaronic Priesthoods.   Joseph Smith was true and faithful to   death, and he was a mighty man of   God, as may be seen by anyone who  will read that code of revelations which  he left to usâ€”as sublime revelations as  God ever gave to man.    Now, brethren and sisters, the   foundation has been laid, and you are  here in these mountains of Israel.   Myself and others have preached to   you in England, in Scotland, in   Wales, in the islands of the sea and

Kenner, George Tribe, Alfred Ran-  dall, jun., Smith Thurston.    Elder J. D. T. McAllister sang "The Mountain Dell."    Elder Wilford Woodruff expressed   the pleasure he experienced in meet-  ing with the Saints in such a building,  and made brief remarks on the texts  that had been read.  His instructions   were very excellent.    A few members of the three choirs   sang, "The Lily of the Vale."    Elder George A. Smith spoke very   pointedly on the obligations resting   upon those who had been assisted by the Perpetual Emigration Fund, to be  prompt in paying their indebtedness,   and assisting those left in the old world who were unable to help them-  selves.  It was the duty of the Saints  to aid the poor.  He made a powerful   appeal in their behalf.    The Fishburn choir sang, "My own  land, Deseret."    The Tabernacle choir sang, "Ye   ransomed of the Lord."    Dismissed by Elder Geo. A. Smith.  ___  Tuesday Forenoon.  The Springville choir sang, "God moves in a mysterious way."    Elder Erastus Snow offered prayer.    The Tabernacle choir sang, "Let sinners take their course."  Elder E. T. Benson expressed the joy that he had experienced in the Gospel, and the universal testimony of the Elders that they knew it was the work of the Most High God in which they were engaged.  He commended highly the industry of the Saints, and spoke of the advantage to the community that must inevitably accrue from the support of home manufactures.  The Fisburn choir, on request, sang again "The mountain Brave."  President Young spoke briefly on the Word of Wisdom.  He alluded to the sayings of some who were slow in obedience to it, that the present teaching on the Word of Wisdom was merely temporary.  He wished it to be understood that it would be continued till the Saints overcame the weaknesses that had grown up with them, to live in accordance with the laws of God.  He wanted all to understand that it was required of the Saints to observe it.  This Word of Wisdom could not be neglected, and the Spirit and blessing of the Almighty preserved.  The President made some very excellent and emphatic remarks on this subject, and closed with the words--"I say, in the name of Israel's God, keep the Word of Wisdom.  Elder Dunbar saing that beautiful hymn, "O! Zion."  Elder Erastus Snow made allusion to the Word of Wisdom, and called upon the Bishops, Elders, and Teachers, in their labors among the Saints, to be kind, and lead the weak on, from effort to effort till they overcame their habits.  The speaker made allusion to the inquiries about the brethren going down to the South.  Some expected but little from that mission and that portion of the Territory, but he only asked for time, and the people would yet see what the South would do.  He made very encouraging remarks to those who had been selected to go and open farms in the South.  He also added some pertinent remarks on the texts given by the President.  The Fishburn choir sang, "O Zion, forever."  President Joseph Young spoke of the counsel that had been given to the young men in Israel to take unto themselves wives, and encouraged the young men and maidens to go forth in faith and keep the commandments of the Lord, and labor to build up the Zion of the Lord.  President Young made a few pleasant remarks on the same subject.  The following names were added to the list of those selected to go South :-  John Heiner, Walter Brown, Joseph   King, Elijah Fuller, Homer Roberts,   Milton Turnbow, William Streeper,  James Fogg, James Hansen, Christian  Christiansen, Amasa Mikesell, Rich-  ard Carlisle, Edward Pugh, James  Hague, jun., John Gregory (Draper- 
 April 14  THE DESERET NEWS.    ELDER W. WOODRUFF said we   had all learned by experience that   we needed the Spirit of the Lord   to help us in our public duties. If  ever there was a dispensation since  the beginning of the world, that   needed the spirit of inspiration,   now was the time. We were living   and were now engaged in the last  dispensation, and needed the as-  sistance of prophets and apostles.  Where were the great nations and   their history, that once stood in   mighty grandeur and power like   Babylon, Tyre, Sidon, etc.? Not   only had those cities been swept   from the earth, but many others,   all of whom had been the subjects  of prophecy in their turn by the   humble servants and prophets of  God, which prophecies had receiv-  ed a literal fulfilment in the entire   destruction of those cities, accord-  ing to the word of the Lord. The   Bible or stick of Judah contained  records of many of those mighty  nations, that had been preserved.   So with the Jaredites, Nephites and   Lamanites, and their cities and   temples, people who once dwelt on   this continent. The only complete   record now in existence in refer-  ence to them is the Book of Mor-  mon, or stick of Ephraim, brought  forth by the spirit of revelation. [##Ezekiel 37:15-20##]  All the prophesies contained in   the Bible and Book of Mormon,   that had received a literal fulfil-  ment, were a sure and certain guar-  antee that others that pertained   to this last dispensation would also   be literally fulfilled in their time   and season. Not one jot or title of  the word of God would fail. [##Matthew 5:18##] God   had decreed by prophets, in the   Book of Mormon, that no nation  should be permitted to continue on  this continent and prosper unless   they kept his commandments, but   when the cup of their iniquity was   full they should be utterly cut   off and be destroyed. This   continent was now occupied by a  Gentile people, who had slain the  Prophet Joseph and his brother   Hyrum, cast the Saints from their   midst and been persecuting them   ever since their organization; and   unless they repented and humbled  themselves before God and embrac-  ed the Gospel, no power on the  face of the earth could prevent the   judgment of God being executed   according to the prophecies of the  servants of God. No previous dis-  pensation was ever fraught with so   many prophecies as this in which   we lived. No man could indulge   in fighting against God and his   servants, without being cursed by   the Almighty. There was no judge,   president, or ruler that ever mea-  sured arms with the Prophet Joseph   Smith or Brigham Young, but   what had withered under the dis-  pleasure of God, and so it would   continue to be. Wo be unto those   who fought against Zion.    He then reviewed the labors of the   present Apostles and Elders who   started out without purse and   script, and exposed to hunger and   cold, traveling thousands of miles  from State to State on foot.    He then exhorted the Saints to   faithfulness, as this was not a time   for trifling away our time, neglect-  ing our prayers, and other du-  ties that God required us to   diligently observe. In a short  time the parents of the present gen-  eration among us, would be with   Joseph and Hyrum, behind the   veil, as a mighty work awaited   them there. Then the responsibil-  ities of this great work would rest   upon the shoulders of our young   people; hence, he said unto them,  prepare yourselves for this labor.    He then spoke of the value of   keeping a record of the dealings of   God among us a people. God had in-  spired him to keep a record since  he became a member of the Church,  and he earnestly urged upon the   young men to do the same. Baby-  lon would be swept away, her li-  braries would be burned up, and   what records were kept by the ser-  vants of God would be invaluable   in the future for generations to   come to read and trace the work of   God as it daily transpired.    He strongly recommended the   Elders to cease spending their   means in smoking and drinking,  and other evil practices, and have  it devoted in educating the child-  ren and we would hear nothing   said about a five cent tax to sustain   free schools.    Prayer by ELDER WILFORD  WOODRUFF. 
 THE DESERET NEWS.  Jan. 12    DISCOURSE  DELIVERED BY  ELDER WILFORD WOODRUFF,  At the General Conference, Thursday  Morning, Oct. 7th, 1880.  -------------  REPORTED BY JOHN IRVINE.    I AM pleased to have the opportun-  ity of again meeting with my breth-  ren and sisters in General Confer-  ence. There is one thing that is  very clear to my mind with regard   to myself and everybody else who  attempts to teach the Latter-day  Saints, and that is we all need the  spirit of the Lord, and without it  we cannot edify anybody, neither  can we build up Zion or do the work   of God without the Holy Spirit.   The prophets, the apostles, and all  men who have been called in every   age of the world to labor for the  kingdom of God have had to  be actuated by this principle, and  that is one reason, as Brother Car-  rington has said, why the weak   things of this world, whom the   Lord has chosen, have confidence in  God to go forth to lift up their voices  and preach the gospel of Christ and  do the work which is required at  their hands.    It is certainly interesting to any  reflecting mind to contemplate the  dealings of God with the inhabit-  ants of the earth in the various ages  and dispensations almost from the  creation of the world as far as we  have any knowledge. I have often  been struck, in reading ancient his-  tory, with the dealings of God with   some of the ancient cities of which  we have some account in   the Bible and other histories   aside from that book. For  instance there is Tyre [##Ezekiel 26##] and Sodom, [##Genesis 19##]  Nineveh and Babylon the great [##Daniel 5##] ---  these mighty cities that were built  as it were to defy all time and all   power but God himself. Just as  quick as Isaiah, Ezekiel, Joel, or   any other prophet whom God raised  up to lift up his voice and declare  the word of the Lord concerning the  destiny of any of these cities, all the   power of Nebuchadnezzar and Bel-  shazzar, or any other king or priest   who dwelt in these cities, ruled   them, governed and controlled   them, had no power to stay the ful-  filment of the words of the servants of   the Lord; these cities have been  overturned, have been laid in the  dust in fulfillment of the word of  God whenever they were ripened  in iniquity. The Lord sent a poor   weak man named Jonah to Nineveh,  a great and mighty city, to go and  warn the inhabitants thereof to re-  pent, or in forty days Nineveh should  be overthrown. Jonah thought it   was a little too much for him, an   obscure man, to go unto a great city  like Nineveh and tell the inhabit-  ants that in a few days the city   would be overturned, hence he fled  into Tarshish. For this he had a pecu-  liar kind of experience for three days   and three nights; you are all acquaint-  ed with the history that I allude to.  When Jonah, however, got on dry  land again he went and fulfiled his   mission to the inhabitants of Nine-  veh. [##Jonah 1-3##] And I have many times  thought that if this generation was   like unto the Ninevites the world   would be different to what it is to-  day. When the people heard the word   of God they believed it. They   went to work and repented and   called upon the Lord, and we are  told "that God withheld the evil   that he had said he would do unto   them; and he did it." But I want  to say that in all these things, when   the Lord has called upon men to la-  bor in the building up of his king-  dom, he has chosen the weak things  of the world. And so it has been  throughout the whole generations   of men. In the days of Jesus Christ,  the apostles chosen were illiterate  men, fishermen a good many of  them; but the Lord gave them the   apostleship, he gave them the  priesthood, and they were command-  ed to go forth and preach the gospel.  But they had to suffer death for   their testimony.    I desire now to refer to ourselves.   In reflecting upon ancient days, let  us look at our own position. The Lord   raised up Joseph Smith. His his-  tory -- his life, his works, his death --  is before the world to-day. Joseph  Smith was an illiterate man, as far   as worldly learning was concerned,  but he was an instrument raised up  by the Lord to lay the foundation of   this great and last dispensation. The  Lord held Joseph Smith responsible   for the keys of the kingdom of God,  for the revelations of heaven, for  every principle which the Lord had  revealed to him. Joseph Smith was  a great man -- that is before the Lord,   before the heavens, and before this  generation. He was ordained of God   to lay the foundation of this Church  and Kingdom; he was true and   faithful unto death, and when we  look at what has followed the lay-  ing of the foundation of this   Church fifty years ago, with  six members, it is a marvel, it is a  mystery in the eyes of the world,   and it is even to us as Latter-day  Saints, to note the progress of this  church and kingdom from that day   until the present. The revelations   which have been given through the   Prophet Joseph Smith, as recorded   in the Book of Doctrine and Coven-  ants, have all had their fulfilment   as far as time would admit. Joseph  Smith lived until he laid the founda-  tion of this church and kingdom; he  lived until he received every key   and principle and priesthood which  belongs to this dispensation, and he   lived until he sealed the same upon  the heads of other men. Every man   that ever knew him, every el-  der or every saint of God that  ever traveled with him, or   have heard him converse, can  form some little idea of the spirit  that filled his bosom. I have seen  him from time to time, in my early  acquaintance with him in Kirtland,   smite his breast and say, "I would  to God I could unbosom my feelings  to my friends." But he could not do  it. It seems it was impossible for  him to reveal to the elders what God   had revealed to him. Nevertheless   he accomplished the work to which   he had been ordained and set apart  by the power of God. He lived, as   I have already said, until he organ-  ized the church in all its various or-  ganizations. He chose the apostles,  seventies, high council, high priests,  and all the various officers in the  church and kingdom of God, by rev-  elation, and when he had finished  this work, the Lord called him  home. He sealed his testimony   with his blood, and went  to the other side of the  vail. He holds the keys of the   kingdom of God on both sides of the  vail, and will hold them to the end-  less ages of eternity. Apostles were  called and set apart to carry on the   work which he commenced. Many  of them who were associated with   him have passed away, others re-  main here in the flesh.    If I could tell you the feelings of  my own heart I would say to the  apostles, seventies, high priests, and  all the officers of this Church and   kingdom, the God of heaven has   raised you up, according to my faith  and my view, and placed you here   on the earth and watched over you   until you have received the ordi-  nances of the gospel. You are rais-  ed up as a kingdom of priests. You  hold the power of the priesthood in  your hands, and I say you are held  responsible before high heaven, be-  fore the gods of eternity, before the  heavenly hosts, and will be held ac-  countable to the judgment day for  the manner you make use of this  priesthood and power which is put  into your hands. This is the con-  [d]ition of all of us from the apostle-  [ship] down through every depart-  ment of this church and kingdom.   There never was a generation since  God made the world that have had  greater power, greater responsibili-  ties, greater blessings, or that have  ever had the kingdom of God placed  upon their shoulders to remain on   the earth until the coming of the   Son of Man. Therefore, how great  the responsibility resting upon us as  apostles, as elders, and in every ca-  pacity in which we are called to act.  This is the way I view our position,  and when I have enjoyed a portion   of the spirit of God, when the vi-  sion of my mind has been  open to comprehend in any  measure our relationship to God and   the heavenly hosts, and the respon-  sibility we are under here to the  Lord and to this generation, I have  felt that I would to God that the vail  might be lifted to the vision of the  Latter-day Saints, that we might see   ourselves as God sees us, and as the  heavenly hosts see us. If we could   only comprehend this we would feel   in many respects different to what   we do at present. We would be dili-  gent. We would not have our hearts  set on the things of this life as they   many times are. Our labors are very   great, very extensive. The Lord re-  quires of us that which he has hardly  ever required of any other genera-  tion. We have the kingdom. We   have got to establish it and maintain   it by faith and good works with the  help of God while we dwell here in  the flesh. We have these temples  to build here in these valleys of the  mountains. This is one of the most   important branches of the responsi-  bility resting upon Latter-day  Saints -- the redemption of our dead.   I have often referred to this subject,  because my mind has been opened   to it, my desires have been exercised   upon this principle. Nearly 1800  years have passed away and over 50  generations of men who have never  seen a Prophet or an Apostle, who  have never heard the gospel of Jesus  Christ, have gone into the spirit  world. They have gone there with-  out the gospel, they are under no re-  sponsibility to that law because they  never came under it. There are  therefore some fifty thousand mil-  lion people to-day in the spirit world   that have to be preached to by the  Elders of Israel. There was nobody   to preach to them until Joseph Smith  went into the spirit world with the  keys of the kingdom of God and un-  locked the prison door. The Prophet   Joseph had this subject of the re-  demption of the dead in his heart   until the day of his death. He la-  bored most diligently to this end.  These millions will be preached to,  and many will receive the truth,  while those who dwell in the flesh  have this duty to perform as their  descendants on the earth to go and  build these temples that we may at-  tend to ordinances for the dead   which the dead cannot attend to  themselves. God requires this at  our hands. It is our duty to enter  into these temples and redeem our  dead as far as we can, that we may  be justified when we go into the   spirit world. We have all the branch-  es, temporal and spiritual, of this   Church and kingdom to carry out.  We have got to build these cities,   towns and villages. We have got to  cultivate the earth, educate our chil-  dren, train them up in the nurture  and admonition of the Lord, and it  is our duty as a people to unite our-  selves together according to the law  of God. We should not set our   hearts too much upon the things   of this world. The earth and the  riches thereof is the Lord's. He will  give them to the Latter-day Saints   as fast as they are prepared to re-  ceive them. But I tell you I have  thought many times that it is a ca-  lamity for a man to become rich in  the midst of this people. It is a  hard matter for a rich man to enter  into the kingdom of God. Men   when they are poor can labor for  their bread and feel thankful to the  God who gives it; but when we   become millionaires our hearts  begin to set upon the things of this  world. Not but what such men may  keep the commandments of God, do   what is right and be justified. I do  not make these remarks because I  wish to speak against the wealthy of   the Latter-day Saints, or anybody  else, but I speak of this that we   should not permit our hearts to be  set upon riches to deprive us of   magnifying our calling before the  Lord. We have got to become rich,  some time or other; the Saints   of God will yet possess the earth.  But the Lord holds us responsible as  a people for the building up of his  kingdom. We have got to build  these temples and redeem our dead.  We have got to pay our tithing.  This is a law which has been given   unto us. We should obey the law of  tithing as a people, so that we may   be qualified to inherit eternal life.    When I come to realize that my  destiny on the other side of the vail  depends upon the little time I have  to spend here, I feel that I have no  time to throw away. We should   seek for the Holy Spirit. We should  magnify our calling. This kingdom  given unto you Latter-day Saints, is   the kingdom of God. It is the king-  dom that Daniel saw, it is the ever-  lasting kingdom which has been   spoken o[f] by all the holy prophets  since the world was made. [##Daniel 2:26-47##] The  little stone cut out of the mountains  without hands, will roll until it fills  the whole earth. The heavenly  hosts are looking to nobody else upon   the footstool of God but the Latter-  day Saints to accomplish this work.   No other people have got the king-  dom. No other people have receiv-  ed the priesthood but the Latter-  day Saints, and we will be held res-  ponsible for the use we make of it.  Therefore, I think we should be di-  ligent, we should be faithful to our   duties, we should look to the posi-  tion which we occupy before the  Lord. Our blessings are great. The  revelations of heaven have been  given unto us. We possess the   Holy Ghost, it has been given to  this people. We have been gather-  ed by it from among the nations of  the earth through the instrumen-  tality of weak and humble men who  have been called upon to preach the   gospel. We regard this as being   one of the strongest evidences of this  being the work of God. The world,   however, hate us. This we re-  gard as another evidence of   the divinity of this work. Said   the Savior in his day, "If the world  hate you, ye know that it hated me  before it hated you. If ye were of  the world, the world would love his   own: but because ye are not of the  world, but I have chosen you out of   the world, therefore the world  hateth you." [##John 15:18-19##] The world hate this  people, the priests of the day  especially, and if they had   the power they would waste  them away from off the face   of the earth; but the Lord has said   that he would break in pieces every  weapon that is formed against Zion.  When the wicked stretch out their   hands to destroy this kingdom of   God, will they prevail? I think not.   We have got the kingdom of God.  The Lord is looking to us, the hea-  venly hosts are looking to us, Joseph  Smith and the whole of the spirit   world, who are righteous, are watch-  ing this people with intense interest.   They expect us to build Zion. They  expect us to build temples and re-  deem our dead. They expect us to   unites ourselves together and to keep  the faith and overcome the world,  the flesh and the devil. They ex-  pect these things at our hands, and  I do hope that they may not be dis-  appointed.    We have every encouragement,   my brethren and sisters, to be faith-  ful. I thank God I have heard this  gospel. I thank God I have lived  to see this people. I thank God that  I have been associated with prophets  and apostles. All the happiness, all  the joy and all the consolation I   have ever had has been since I em-  braced the gospel of Jesus Christ. I  have a testimony for myself, as you  have for yourselves, that this is the  work of God. I know it is the work   of God. I know Joseph Smith was   a prophet of the Lord. The Lord   raised him up to lay the foundation  of this Church and Kingdom. No   man could do it of himself. The  voice of God, the voice of the Holy  Ghost, the voice of inspiration has  declared these things from day to   day and from year to year. It   is by this power that we have   been gathered together. Who could   have gathered this people by any  other principle only by the gospel of  Jesus Christ. Where is there a   minister on the face of the earth --   a minister of the gospel or one who  professes to be such -- who dare go to  the nations of the earth and tell the  people that if they receive his testi-  mony and will go forth and be bap-  tized, they shall receive the Holy   Ghost? Is there any man on the   earth dare do this? No one. No   people ever has done it excepting   the Latter-day Saints. Why dare  they not do this? Because God  would not back up their testimony,  and if we had not been called of  God, if this gospel had not been of  God, we should have been found out  a great many years ago. When  we go and declare these things   we promise the sons and daughters  of Adam that if they will receive the  gospel of Christ they shall receive  the Holy Ghost. We offer this in  the name of Israel's God. We bap-  tize men and women, we lay hands   upon them, and they do receive the   Holy Ghost, and it bears record to   them and they rise up and bear tes-  timony of the truth of these things.   It is by this power we have been  gathered. It is by this power we   shall build up Zion. We shall con-  tinue to labor. We shall prosper.  We shall have power to build these   temples and dedicate them. We   shall have power to build others and   will continue this work until the  Son of Man comes in the clouds of   heaven to reward every man accord-  ing to the deeds done in the body.  Then let us as Elders of Israel   round up your shoulders for the  kingdom of God.  Let us strive to  retain the Holy Spirit that we may  realize our responsibility and be   ready to magnify our calling and do  our duty before the Lord.    I pray God my Heavenly Father  to let his blessing rest upon us dur-  ing this conference -- upon Brother   Taylor, the Apostles, the Elders of   Israel, and those who teach us and  instruct us, for Christ's sake,  Amen. 
 among the nations of the earth. We  have declared unto you the Gospel of  Jesus Christ. You have believed our  testimony and have received it. You  went forth and were baptized in water  for the remission of your sins, and  you received the Holy Ghost by   the power of God, and by that   power you are here today. We might  have preached to you till we had been  as old as Methuselah, but if our testi-  mony had not been backed up by the   power of God, you would have re-  mained at home; you would not have  been here in these mountains to fulfil  the revelations of God. These things  are true, and you know they  are true. You know you received  the testimony yourselves, and by this  you have been gathered together. Up-  wards of sixty years have passed over  our heads since the organization of this   Church on the earth, and its history is   before the world. It has been a little   stone cut out of the mountains without  hands. We have had a terrible war-  fare from the organization of this   Church until today; but one thing is  comforting and encouraging: the God  of heaven inspired men thous-  ands of years ago to tell exactly  what these Latter-day Saints would do.  They were of the house of Israel, scat-  tered among the nations of the earth,  and the Lord would stretch out His  hand and gather them together, and  they would go to the place that the old   Patriarch said should belong to Joseph:    Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruit-  ful bough by a well; whose branches run  over the wall. The archers have sorely  grieved him, and shot at him, and hated him  : But his bow abode in strength, and   the arms of his hands were made strong   by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob;  (from thence is the shepherd, the stone of   Israel.) * * * The blessings of thy  fathers have prevailed above the bles-  sings of my progenitors unto the utmost  bounds of the everlasting hills: they shall  be on the head of Joseph, and on the   crown of the head of him that was separ-  ated from his brethren.(##Genesis 49:22-26|Gen. xlix,22-26##).  You are the descendants of this holy   man of God. You have come here in fulfillment of these things.  I do not expect that I will be able to  answer my mind in telling you how I  feel with regard to these things,  but I will do the best I can. You have been  gathered to these mountains of Israel,  led by a prophet, a seer, a revelator,  and a mighty man. When we came  here we found a barren desert. Men  said, "Go to California; you cannot do   anything here." "No," President  Young said, "we shall stay here;   we shall build a temple here; we shall  build a city here. This is what is ord-  ained of God, and we shall accom-  plish it." Judge, brethren and sisters,   whether he was inspired or not. We   have made a beginning. We have  made the desert to blossom as the   rose, and laid the foundation for the  great work of our God that is going to  be fulfilled in these mountains of   Israel, and you will stand in holy  places while the judgments of God   work in the earth. Yes, let the world   read these judgments of God   and that which lies before all nations under   heaven. These things will come to   pass to the very letter. Then what is our   duty and our position here?  The Lord told us through the Prophet   Joseph in the beginning of this work   that He was going to call Elders into   the vineyard for the last time, to prune   the vineyard. We have got to   prepare it for the coming of the   Son of Man. The wheat has   got to be gathered into the   garner before the chaff is burned. And   the Elders of Israel have got to go   forth and warn the inhabitants of the  earth, as Joseph Smith told the Twelve   Apostles the last time I saw him be-  fore his martyrdom, when he laid be-  fore us the work he was required to do.   The Prophet said: "God has given to  me every key, every power and princi-  ple of salvation belonging to this great   last dispensation; and I have sealed   upon your heads every key, principle   and power which God has sealed upon  me. Now, you Apostles, round up   your shoulders and bear off this king-  dom, or you will be damned, saith the  Lord." I do not forget these things,   and they are true. I believe I am the   only man living in the flesh who was   present on that occasion. This is our  position, brethren and sisters, before   the Lord. There is a tremendous   responsibility upon these Latter-  day Saints. We have the world   to warn. We have to preach  the Gospel, and attend to those things  that God has committed to us. The   Prophet Joseph and his brother Hyrum  were martyred, and they will have a  martyr's crown. They have gone to   the other side of the veil, to mingle   with the Gods and to plead for their   brethren, and they are faithful and   diligent in their duties. But some of   us are left behind. Since that time   this work has gone on, and it has got  to continue, and we cannot avoid this.   What the Lord requires at the hands of   these Apostles, and Elders and Latter-  day Saints is to warn the world, to   preach the Gospel, to build up Zion, to   carry out the purposes of the Lord, and  to prepare ourselves to stand in holy  places while the judgments of God   work in the earth.    Joseph Smith revealed unto us the  principle of the redemption of the   dead. There was no revelation I ever  read that gave me more joy and con-  solation than that. Jesus Christ and   the Apostles had to go to the spirits in  prison and redeem those who had lived  from the days of Noah down to their  generation. [##1 Peter 3:19-20##] Here we have one thous-  and eight hundred years, during which   millions and millions of the human  family have died without the Gospel of  Christ. They have gone into the spirit   world, and the Lord expects these Lat-  ter-day Saints to go forth and redeem  these dead, as they hold the keys of   the salvation of their dead; so that   when they go into the spirit world and  meet their fathers and their mothers   and their relatives, they shall not say   to them, "You held the keys of my  salvation, and you have not attended to  this work, and I am left here in prison."  We should not neglect this. It is not   only our duty to preach the Gospel and   to warn the world, that they may be   left without excuse in the day of God's  judgment, but it is our duty to re-  deem our dead. Joseph Smith, when   he was martyred, went and opened   the prison doors in the spirit world.   So did those brethren that died in   Zion's camp. Every Elder that has   gone to the other side of the veil has   a work to perform there, and those  in the spirit world will receive their   testimony. But they cannot be bap-  tized there. Their sons and daugh-  ters who dwell in the flesh have to   carry out this great and mighty work.    Brethren and sisters, these are   some of the duties that are required of us.   We should open our eyes, and our   ears, and our hearts, to see, hear and   understand the great and mighty re-  sponsibility that rest upon us. Thank  God, we have had power in this barren  desert to build three temples. Hun-  dreds of thousands of the dead have  been redeemed in these temples, and   there are millions yet to be redeemed.   Here is this Salt Lake Temple that  President Young laid the founda-  tion of. We want to finish that   temple and dedicate it unto   the Lord. This is some of   the work that is required of us. The  eyes of all the heavenly hosts are over  these Latter-day Saints, and they are  over these sons and daughters that   dwell in the mountains of Israel. God   Himself and His Son Jesus Christ, who   is our advocate with the Father, look  to us to do this work. The eyes of   Joseph Smith and every Prophet and   Saint of God who dwells in the spirit  world are watching over us. They   cannot come here and build that Tem-  ple. They are not ordained to that.   But we are here in the flesh, and I   ask, in the name of the Lord, and as  a great favor of these Latter-day   Saints, that we will unite together   with our means and finish that Temple,   that we may go into it and redeem our   dead. Many of you have got thousands   of relatives in the spirit world who   are looking to you. They never   heard the Gospel in life, but they will  hear it, at the mouth of David Patten,   Joseph Smith, Brigham Young, John   Taylor, and these Apostles and Elders   that have gone into the spirit world.   But, as I said before, they cannot be   baptized there. We can, and we must   do it for them.    This is how I feel about our position.   We are here by the power of God. It   is a marvel to me that we are as well  off as we are. It is a marvel to me  that we have the power that we have.   For there is a vast number of fallen   spirits that are at war against God and   His Christ, against this people and this   Church, and against the redemption   of the dead. Lucifer knows that if  this Church prospers, his kingdom will   fall. But God has sustained us, and   will sustain us until we get through, if   we do our duty. The hand of God is  over us here, and Zion is a city   set upon a hill, which cannot be   hid. We are only small, and have only   just begun the organization; but the   Lord will hasten His work, and it will   continue until all these promises of   God will be fulfilled. There is where   my faith rests and my consolation   dwells. I know that God is true, and   that the testimonies of all the Patri-  archs and Prophets, have thus far been  fulfilled to the very letter. There is   not a city nor a generation but has felt   the chastening hand of God when they  have undertaken to overthrow the   work of God.    I want to say something in relation   to home industry. True, it is Sunday,   but that matters not; for we are called   to build up Zion temporally as well   as spiritually. All that has been said   in our Conference with regard to home   industry is good. We want to con-  tinue this, and as far as we possibly  can we should, as President Young  told us, open doors of work 
 THE DESERET WEEKLY. 559    DISCOURSE    Delivered by President Wilford Wood-  ruff at the General Conference,  held in the Tabernacle, Salt Lake  City, Sunday morning, April 6,  1890.     [REPORTED BY ARTHUR WINTER. ]    I feel that every heart in this  congregation should be filled with  gratitude to God for the blessings  we enjoy this morning, that so  many of us have the privilege of  meeting in this Tabernacle in peace  and quietude to worship God.    I want to say to this large assem-  bly that the President of the Church,  or his Counselors, or the Twelve  Apostles, or any other man who  dwells in the flesh, has no power in  and of himself to instruct or edify  the Latter-day Saints; he can only  do so by the power and blessings of  Almighty God. In this respect I  am as weak as the least member of  this Church and Kingdom. We are  all dependent upon the Lord; and I  feel this morning that I stand in  need, not only of the faith and  prayers of the Latter-day Saints,  but of the blessings of God and the  Holy Spirit to assist me to declare  unto the Latter-day Saints the word  of the Lord.    I will say another thing. The  Saints of God in every age of the  worldâ€”prophets, apostles and reve-  latorsâ€”have been in such a position  that they have had no chance to be  lifted up in the pride of their hearts,  or to boast of their power and  strength to do the work of God  among the children of men. Every  man who was acquainted with Jo-  seph Smith and those who followed  him, knows full well that this was  their condition while they dwelt  among us. Joseph Smith was a  humble man. He was one of the  weak instruments in the hands of  God. He was raised up in this last  dispensation and fulness of times to  lay the foundation of this great  Church on the earth. He was taught  by the administration of an[g]els from  heaven. He knew full well that his  strength lay in God and not in him-  self. That is our condition at the  present time. We have no chance  to be lifted up in the pride of our  hearts with regard to the position  we occupy. If the President of the  Church or either of his Counselors or  of the Apostles, or any other man,  feels in his heart that God cannot  do without him, and that he is  especially important in order  to carry on the work of  the Lord, he stands upon slippery  ground. I heard Joseph Smith say  that Oliver Cowdery, who was the  second Apostle in this Church, said  to him, "If I leave this Church it  will fall." Said he, "Oliver, you  try it." Oliver tried it. He fell;  but the Kingdom of God did not.  I have been acquainted with other  Apostles in my day and time who  felt that the Lord could not do  without them; but the Lord got  along with His work without them.  I say to all menâ€”Jew and Gentile,  great and small, rich and poorâ€”that  the Lord Almighty has power with-  in Himself, and is not dependent  upon any man, to carry on His 
 516 THE DESERET WEEKLY.    President Wilford Woodruff    Addressed the Conference. He said:   I feel this morning to offer up the  gratitude of my heart to God, my   Heavenly Father, that my life has  been preserved to again meet in a  semi-annual Conference with the  Saints. I feel thankful that I have  the privilege of meeting with so   many of the Apostles, Elders and  Saints who have assembled here on   this occasion.    Our Heavenly Father revealed  from heaven, over sixty years ago,   to the inhabitants of the earth,  through the mouth of the Prophet  of God, whom He raised up, that   He had set His hand once more,   for the last time, to prune His vine-  yard and to prepare the people of   the earth for the coming of the  Son of Man. Over sixty years have  passed away since those revelations   were given. The Lord called upon   the children of men, to take upon  themselves the name of Christâ€”  those who were willing to enter in  the vineyard of the Lord and preach  the Gospel of Christ to them. He   gave us to understand that we should  be called to go forth and preach the  message of the Son of God in this  last dispensation of the fulness of   times. Many of those who engaged  to carry out and fulfill these  promises of God to mankind   are today in the spirit world. They  have closed their mission, they  have borne their testimony, they   have fulfilled the object of their  creation, they have magnified the  high and holy Priesthood which the   God of heaven has sealed upon   their heads, to go forth and admin-  ister in the ordinances of life and  salvation. A few of us are left;   some of us still remain here in the  flesh, and we are still called upon to  labor. We are still called to officiate  in the Holy Priesthood, and to ad-  minister in the ordinances of salva-  tion to the children of men.    It has been a very important dis-  pensation, a very interesting gener-  ation in which we live as Latter-day   Saints. The history of this Church   is before the world, and we are still  passing through many interesting   portions of the experience of the   work of God in the last days.    I will say to the Latter-day Saints,   the Lord has fulfilled, so far, all   that He has promised unto us. The   Lord has called many menâ€”hun-  dreds of themâ€”from the nations of  the earth, who have received the  Holy Priesthood, the authority by   which the God of Israel has always  administered in heaven and on the  earth the ordinances of life and sal-  vation. They have labored faith-  fully until the present day; they  have warned the inhabitants of the  earth. All nations under heaven  have been visited by the Elders of   Israel as far as the doors were open  to receive them. The Lord, so far,  has warned the world; He has, so  far, carried out the object of the   calling of the sons of men. The Gos-  pel has been preached and the chil-  dren of men have heard it in every  nation, including our own. They  have heard the testimony of these   Elders of Israel. And what was  the mission given to the Elders?  To go forth and deliver the Gospel  message to all the world. The peo-  ple were called upon to repent of  their sins, to have faith in the Lord   Jesus Christ, and when they had   faith in God, in the Gospel, faith to   believe and receive those testimonies  given to them, they were called upon  to go forth and be baptized for the  remission of their sins. Then they   had the privilege of receiving the  laying on of hands for the reception  of the Holy Ghost.    These are some of the principles   that have been taught from the   time of Father Adam down to that   of every Patriarch, Prophet, Apos-  tleâ€”and even the Savior himselfâ€”  in their day and generation, as the  only Gospel ever revealed to the  human family in any age of   the world. There has never been but   one Gospel; that Gospel is "the  same today, yesterday and forever." [##Hebrews 13:8##]  That Gospel is the same that was  taught by Adam to his children;   which Elijah, Methuselah, and all  the ancient prophets and patriarchs  taught to their posterity, and the in-  habitants of the earth. Jesus Christ   taught the same when He came in   the meridian of time; He never de-  viated from it in any instance. Paul   the Apostle, born in due time, re-  ceived the Gospel at the hands of   the Lord, who said, though he or  an angel from heaven preached any  other Gospel, let him be accursed. [##Galatians 1:8-9##]  That Gospel was revealed to Joseph  Smith in all its fulness, pow-  er and glory, with all its   graces, gifts and principles. He  taught it to those around him; he or-  ganized this Church on the 6th day   of April, 1830; and through all the  tribulations, persecutions and trou-  bles of the Latter-day Saints, that   same Gospel has been among us.    I feel thankful that I have lived  so long, connected with this Church   and Kingdom, and that I live now   in the midst of the Latter-day  Saints. As the Lord has set His   hand to warn the world, to warn  this generation, to prune the vine-  yard. He will leave every nation un-  der heaven without excuse, in these  days of judgments, calamities and  tribulations, which are about to be  poured out upon the earth.    I feel thankful that I have been  associated with this people up to the  present day. How long I shall re-  main among the Latter-day Saints I   do not know. It matters not with   me; but I have the same testimony   to bear today that I have had from   the commencement of this Church  â€”that it is the work of Godâ€”as prom-  ised and prophesied of through the  mouths of inspired men for 6000  years. I bear my testimony to these   things this morning.    I hope and trust that while we   are assembled in this conference  our hearts may be united in faith   and prayer, that we may enjoy the  Holy Spirit of God. Without the  inspiration of that Spirit, Utah   would be as barren a desert, as far   as we are concerned, today as we   found it on the 24th of July, 1847.  When you heard the Gospel of   Christ preached by those humble  men who had been called from their  various occupations, to go forth in the   Lord's cause, inspired by the Holy  Ghost, without purse or scrip, tak-  ing no thought what they should eat   or what they should drink, you  knew that what they taught was   true. You heard and believed their  testimony, and that same testimony  is here with this entire people  today. When you received the   testimony you were baptized for the  remission of your sins, you had   hands laid upon you for the recep-  tion of the Holy Ghost. Without   all this you would have remained at  home.    I know that this is the work of   God, and so do you; therefore let   our hearts be thankful to God; let   us unite together in our prayers to   Him; let us do our duty faithfully   while we dwell here in the flesh,   and carry out those principles in   which we have been taught. Let  us continue to preach the Gospel,   to warn the nations, to build up Zion,  and establish righteousness; so that  when we get through and go on the  other side of the vail we will be   satisfied with our labors here. We  should try, therefore, to live our re-  ligion, to be true and faithful to our  covenants, and to all those principles  of the Gospel of Jesus Christ which  will save all men both in time and  eternity.    I pray to God my Heavenly Father  that His blessing may rest upon us  â€”upon these Elders of Israel, upon   these Apostles of the Lamb of God,   that they may be inspired to declare   the words of salvation during this   conference to their brethren and  sisters, which may God grant, for  Christ's sake, Amen. 
 President Wilford Woodruff.    After a few prefatory observations,  said he never wished to address any  body of people upon the Gospel of  Christ unless he could do so by the  Spirit and inspiration of Almighty  God; and that was his feeling this  morning.    Those who were at Conference yes-  terday listened to some very strong  testimonies presented by the Apostles.  There was one discourse in particular  to which he desired now to refer; that  of Brother Abraham H. Cannon, who  alluded to the views of certain per-  sons as to the great mistakes which  had been made in this world, some of  them by people calling themselves  Prophets, Apostles, and Saints of God.  One of these alleged mistakes was in  God permitting Adam and Eve to  partake of the forbidden fruit; another  was the mistake made in the Savior  being born in a stable and cradled in a  manger, instead of his coming  as a conqueror, as the leader  of the inhabitants of the  earth; another was that the Apostles  and Prophets ceased to have revela-  tions when Joseph Smith died. It was  to these principles that he wished to  refer.    When the Prophet Joseph was  called of God to lay the foundation of  this Church and kingdom he was a  mere boy. His first prayer to the God  of heaven was offered when he was  only fourteen or fifteen years of age.  He had read and studied the scriptures  previously and was anxious to know  what religious sect to join. An answer 
 THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS'    MILLENIAL STAR.    "And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away  thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord."â€”ACTS XXII: 16.    No. 10 Vol. LVIII. Thursday, March 5, 1896. Price One Penny.    DISCOURSE BY PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF.    THE following discourse was delivered by President Wilford Woodruff, at  the Davis Stake Conference, in Farmington, September 7, 1895:    How little we knew when we were born; how little we knew when we  were boys and girls; and when we arrived to manhood and the Spirit of   God led us to have faith in the revelations of God, and not to join the   sectarian world, still how little we knew what lay before us and the pur-  poses of God concerning us. I can bear testimony to the truth of the   discourse we listened to this forenoon. We live in a very important day   and generation. We live in the midst of important works of God, and we   little knew in early youth and manhood that we ourselves had been pre-  served in the spirit world for seven thousand years, to stand in the flesh  in the last days, to be called of God to labor in His vineyard and to build  up His Church. Nevertheless these are truths. The Lord has never set   His hand in any age of the world to perform a work unless He has pre-  pared an element to carry out that work. That is our condition as Latter-  day Saints. In my youth I attended Sabbath school under Dr. Porter, a  great minister; but the very moment I began to read the Scriptures and   learn what was in them, that very moment there was a spirit told me that   that Church and Gospel that I read of in the New Testament were not on   the earth. I never heard a minister acknowledge the necessity of the   works that followed the teachings of the Savior and His Apostles. No-  thing would make them angry quicker than to tell them that these were  the works of God and would be again established on the earth. The clergy  would be immediately stirred up if they heard of any one advocating these   thingsâ€”a thing which I frequently did in my early manhood. I felt that   I could not join any church unless I could find one that taught those   principles which I read of in the New Testamentâ€”a church that enjoyed

 548  THE DESERET WEEKLY.    WILFORD WOODRUFF  and labor among ourselves. These temporal   matters are a part   of the labors that we have to per-  form while we are here. Brethren,  when we get on the other side of the   veil and our eyes are opened, we will   marvel over a great many things that   we do not understand here; and a  great many things will there be un-  derstood that cannot be here.  One subject more I want to name,  and that is with regard to our future.   I will tell you what the Lord has re-  vealed to me. You talk of revelation.  I have a good many revelations. We  are not particularly required to write  all the revelations given to us. Joseph Smith wrote revelations in his day,   and we have them to read, and they   will all be fulfilled to the very letter.  There has been a good deal said about  the rising generation of the Latter-  Day Saints. I will tell you what will come to pass.My sons, the   sons of my Counselors, the sons of   these Apostles, and the sons of  this people, will rise up by   the power of God, and they   will take this Kingdom and bear it off.   You need make no mistake about this   matter. They are the element that   God has ordained, the same as He  ordained us, to do His work. Our   posterity will not forsake the Lord, nor   their fathers, nor their mothers, nor   the work in which they are engaged.   Too many of them, it is true,   have been led astray; too many of them have  been found where they should not be; but the bulk of the sons of this people will remain true and faithful  to this work. There is no other element   that the heavens look to but the rising   generation of the Latter-day Saints, in   connection with the Lamanites, and  they will be true and faithful. The   Spirit of God will be with them, and  they will follow the footsteps of their  fathers, as their fathers follow Christ;  and they will in their day and time  stand-yes, brethren and sisters, our  sons will stand in the flesh in the midst   of these judgments of Almighty God  when it will require faith and power,   even to commanding the elements to   obey them, to live. These judgments  are at the door.  Brethren and sisters, many of us   forget at times that we are here on a   mission. When I was but a boy I read   the New Testament, under old Dr.  Porter and others, and I read about  Jesus Christ and His Apostles; that   they had power to command the elements to obey them, power to command the sick and they were hea  led, and power to com-  mand the dead and they were raised to life. "Oh," said I,  "may I live to se a Prophet; may I live  to see an Apostle; may I live to see a   man of God who will teach me these   principles." The first sermon I heard  preached by a servant of God I em-  braced the Gospel and was baptized.   From that day to this I have not seen   one moment when I have had   any doubt with regard to the truth   of this work. Whatever trials I   have had, they have been   of a different nature to that. I say  to our young men in Zion, arise   and obey the commands of God. Go before   the Lord and get the Holy Ghost, and   open your eyes to the work that lies  before you. Your fathers are passing  away and going to the other side of the   veil, where we shall all go in our time.  But the kingdom will rise, and God   will sustain it, and it will never fall   from this time till it is prepared as the  Bride, the Lamb's wife, for the coming   of the Son of Man.  I feel to bless the Latter-day Saints.   We have got a noble class of men and   women in the mountains of Israel. No  better men and women ever lived on  the earth. Read the history of these  Relief Societies, these Improvement  Associations, these Primaries, and the  labors of our sisters in Israel. They  have been true and faithful all the   way through, and they have  been raised up, the same as   the Elders of Israel have, to   stand in the flesh and to magnify their  callings in their day and time. They   are doing a great work, and God will   bless them, and I bless them with every   sentiment of my heart. I feel also to bless my brethren who bear the  Apostleship. Now, you talk about   union. Can Apostles dwell with this  work upon their shoulders without   being united? They cannot do it. The   sameSpirit bears record to each of  them.Here are my Counselors and the   Apostles, we are of one heart and  mind, and when we have the Spirit of   God there is nothing but that we see  alike in. Here is Brother Snow, an   aged man as well as myself, and the   President of the Twelve Apostles; he  has got the spirit of his calling and  office with him, and God is blessing  him. He is full of revelation, full of  the Spirit of the Lord. We have a  mighty work upon us, and we want   power in the midst of Israel to carry  it out, and to do what the Lord   requires of us; and we shall have  power to do it. I tell you I rejoice   when I let my mind rest upon these   temples of our God in these mountains  of Israel. Who ever heard of such a  thing in any generation?-a class of   men driven from the society of the  Christian world into the wilderness   have power to gather together and rear  these temples unto the name of the   Most High God, and go into these   temples and to attend to the ordinances  therein. We hold and will hold the  keys of the salvation of our dead to   the endless ages of eternity. As the  Prophet said, the Lord has raised up   saviors upon Mount Zion, while the  kingdom is the Lord's in the latter  days. The heavens are full of revela-  tion. The earth is full of revelation.  The Bible is full of revelation, as well  as these other books that we have;  and we have revelation, and should  have day by day.  I thank God that I am alive, and  that He has preserved me up to this  hour. I have a good many times, and  some of them lately, come pretty near  going to the other side of the veil; but I   know that I have tens of thousands of  prayers of righteous men and women,   which ascend into the ears of the Lord   of Sabaoth day by day; and when I   say that of myself I say it of my Coun-  selors, of these Apostles, and of the   Elders of Israel. They have the  prayers of the people. These prayers  are heard and answered. The Lord   has taken whom he would take, and  has preserved in life whom he would   preserve, according to the counsels of  His own will. We are appointed a  certain work, and when we get through   our sons will take it and bear it off.   Zion will arise, and the glory of God  will rest upon her; she will have power  in the earth, and the day is at hand  when, as Joseph Smith said, thou-  sands of the great men of the earth will   come to Zion to behold the glory   thereof.  God bless you, and pour out His Spirit  upon you, and guide and direct you  all.Remember your prayers. Be  kind to one another. Do not find fault  with one another. We ought to be  careful in speaking evil of one another.  Bear one another up. Brethren and  sisters, the glory of the whole matter is,  that when we get through we are go-  ing to have our families with us-our  fathers and our mothers, our brothers  and our sisters, our wives and our   children-in the morning of the  resurrection, in the family organization  of the celestial world, to dwell forever  and forever. This is worth all you or   I can sacrifice the few years we have   to spend here in the flesh. God bless  you. Amen. 
 560 THE DESERET WEEKLY.    work; but when He does call men  to do His work they have to trust  in Him.    I marvel today, in my own mind,  why I stand before you as the Presi-  dent of the Church of Jesus Christ  of Latter-day Saints. I have been  associated with some forty Apostles  in my day and time. Twenty-four  of themâ€”two quorumsâ€”are today  in the spirit world. There is a  quorum of young men, many of  them the sons of Apostles who have  passed away, with us today. Well,  when I look at this and see that I  am still in the midst of Israel, and  realize that I have been called to  this position, I marvel at it. But it  is the business of the Lord and not  of man. It is not a position that I  have sought. On the other hand,  the eternal truth of this responsibil-  ity stares me in the face. I  know that I am responsible,  for the position that I hold today, to  the God of heaven, who has chosen  me, as are these apostles before me  and these tens of thousands of  Elders of Israel who now dwell in  the flesh on the earth. I attended  a Priesthood meeting here last  evening with quite a number of  those bearing the Priesthood. I  look upon the responsibility of these  people as being very great. We  have been called upon in this day  to receive the Priesthood and to go  forth and preach the Gospel of Je-  sus Christ to this generationâ€”to the  Gentiles first, and then to the House  of Israel. This has been my lot.  It has been the lot of these Apostles,  and many, yea thousands, of the  leaders of the Latter-day Saints.  We have been called upon to preach  the Gospel of Christ to this genera-  tion and to warn them of the judg-  ments which are to come.    There has been a great deal said  at this conference. We have had  strong testimonies borne by the  Elders of Israel who have addressed  us. I remarked at the commence-  ment of this conference (there were  comparatively few people here then)  concerning our position and revela-  tion. I remarked that Moses gave  revelations to Israel. We have the  Bibleâ€”the stick of Judahâ€”contain-  ing the law of God through Moses  and through the ancient prophets  and patriarchs. [##Ezekiel 37:19##] It has been handed  down to us through the thousands of  years that are past and gone. While  libraries, like the library of Alexan-  dria (which was destroyed by an  Arab chief and took days and days  to burn, it being one of the largest  ever gathered together in the world)  have perished, the Bible has been  preserved unto us, and we have it  to read. It gives unto us the law of  God given to the ancients. But  there has been no change in that  law, so far as the gospel is con-  cerned, from that day until this.  The Bibleâ€”the Old and the New  Testamentâ€”gives unto us the law  whereby we may be exalted and go  back again into the presence of God  and dwell with Him for ever and  ever. It gives unto us the course  we should pursue in order to receive  a part in the first resurrection, that  we may come forth clothed with  glory, immortality and eternal life.  It also gives us the history, not only  of what is passed with the Jews, but  of what is to come to pass. Then  we have a Book of Mormonâ€”the  stick of Joseph in the hands of  Ephraimâ€”that was written upon  this continent by apostles and  prophets. It contains, among other  things, the teachings of Jesus Christ  when he appeared, after his resur-  rection, in his immortal and glori-  ous body, and taught the gospel  here. Those revelations contain a  great many principles. They show  unto us the final winding-up scene,  the situation of great Babylon and  the judgments that were to come to  pass in the last days before the com-  ing of the Son of Man. We have  also the Book of Doctrine and Cov-  enants, which you have in your  houses and which you can  read. This code of revela-  tion was given through the  mouth of the Prophet Joseph Smith,  by the Urim and Thummim and  otherwise. That book contains  some of the most glorious and most  sublime revelations God ever gave  to man. It shows unto us what lies  before us, what awaits this nation  and the nations of the earth, and  what is at the door of the inhabitants  of the earth. These things are  clear, they are pointed, they are  strong, and they are the revelations  of God, and they will be fulfilled,  whether men believe it or not.    Now, with regard to present reve-  lation. President Young led us a  great many years. He led us to these  valleys. He was a man of God,  filled with revelation. His teachings  were attended by the inspirations of  Almighty God. He laid the foun-  dation of the building of this whole  Territory. He governed and con-  trolled this Tabernacle we are in,  the Temple we are building, and  other Temples that we have built  in this Territory; and in all his  counsels the word of the Lord was  with him. He had but few revela-  tions that were written and pub-  lished to the world. But we had  the word of the Lord through him day  by day. The same with President  Taylor. We have already got, as I  said before, this code of revelation,  which we can read every day, and  which is profitable for doctrine,  for reproof, for correction, for in-  struction, to guide us in the way of  life from day to day and from year  to year while we dwell in the flesh.  When the Apostles and Elders of  Israel are called to teach you, when  they are called to go abroad and to  teach the inhabitants of the earth,  they are commanded of the Lord to  speak as they are moved upon by  the Holy Geost; and when a man  speaks as he is moved upon by the  Holy Ghost, it is the word of the  Lord, it is the mind of the Lord, it  is the will of the Lord, it is Scripture,  it is the power of God unto salvation  unto every one that believes. If we  do not have the Holy Ghost we have  no business to teach. But when the  Elders of Israel do teach you by the  Holy Ghost, you have the revela-  tions of God to you. We have these  revelations lying before us for our  guidance day by day, as well as the  living oracles.    I would say to the President of  the United States, to the Congress  of the United States, to the Cabinet,  and to all the inhabitants of this  land, as well as to all the na-  tions of the earthâ€”kings, emperors,  princes and peopleâ€”do not worry  about these Latter-day Saints. I  would say to all nations under  heaven, if these people are not the  people of God, if this work has not  been established by God Almighty,  they will fall of themselves, they  will be swept from the face of the  earth by the judgments of God,  when Great Babylon falls. But if  they are of God, what can you do  about it? What can the nations of  the earth do about it? Have the na-  tions forgotten that there is a God in  Israel? Have they forgotten that  there is a God who created the hea-  vens and the earth, and that He gov-  erns and controls all these things? If  He has set His hand to perform this  work, there is no power on the face  of the earth, or in hell, that can de-  stroy it, because Jehovah holds it in  His own hands. He holds our des-  tiny and the destiny of all the world  in His hands. But the great diffi-  culty with this nation and with all  nations is, as it has been in every  age, they do not acknowledge the  hand of God in any of these things.  You see it in the history of the  whole world and in the dealings  of God with men and cities and na-  tions, from the creation of the world.  I have referred to these things be-  fore in my remarks. Whenever a  nation is ripened in iniquity, the  Lord raises up prophets and inspired  men and they are sent forth to warn  that nation, and when they have  warned the people and given unto  them the word of the Lord, that  word will not fall unfulfilled. We  have before us a great many instan-  ces of the dealings of God with men.  We have a fair example in Babylon  the Great. King Nebuchadnezzar  surrounded with the city walls a hun-  dred feet high and wide enough for  several chariots to ride abreast upon  the top thereof, with brazen gates and  with a power to defy all but God  himself, what did he say: "Is  not this great Babylon, that I have  built for the house of the kingdom  by the might of my power, and for  the honor of my majesty?" [##Daniel 4:30##] The  prophet might have told Neb-  uchadnezzar that the God of heaven  had proclaimed a man before he was  born that would come and take that  great city and destroy its ruler. Cyrus  was named by the Lord before he  was born, through the mouth of the  prophet; [##Isaiah 44:28##] and when the time came,  as King Belshazzar and his princes  were feasting and drinking wine  out of the cups that had been  brought from the temple at Jerusa-  lem, he took possession of the city  and carried off the treasures. [##Daniel 5:1-4##] The  army of Cyrus turned the river out  of its course and walked in under  the walls of the city. Belshazzar  was taken prisoner and slain, and  the city went into the hands of  people they were not looking for. [##Daniel 5:30-31##]  What did Cyrus do when he took  the city of Babylon? He took the  richesâ€”cattle, horses and propertyâ€”  there was in that city and offered  them as a sacrifice to the great God.  This is the course that a heathen  king took; and we understand, from 
 Wm Criddle  Oct. 10 [18]95 
 came to him from the Lord thereon.  The heavens were opened; God the  Father and God the Son appeared to  him, and the Father said,  "This is My beloved Son;  hear ye Him." The history of Joseph  Smith from that time until he organ-  ized the Church of Jesus Christ of  Latter-day Saints, on the 6th of April,  1830, was a constant scene of revela-  tion and visitation. His counselors  were the angelsâ€”those who held the  Priesthood in the flesh while on the  earth and administered upon this con-  tinent to the sons of Adam, to the  children of Israel who dwelt here.  They were his teachers and continued  to be so until he was called to  organize this Church and Kingdom  upon the foundation laid by the an-  cient apostles and prophets, "Jesus  Christ himself being the chief corner  stone."    The speaker said he would like to  ask that assembly of Latter-day Saints,  what power would the Prophets of God  in those early days have had to or-  ganize and build up the Church of  Christ upon earth unless they had  been taught either by the angels of  God or the Lord Himself? There was  no other way; and every step that the  Prophet Joseph took, up to the very  day of his death, was a proof of this.    Any man or woman who read the  Book of Doctrine and Covenants would  find there a code of the most sublime  revelations ever given by God to man-  kind. True, Joseph Smith was illiter-  ate, in a measure, so far as learning  was concerned; but those who had read  those revelations could see that no ig-  norant boy, without inspiration,  could have prepared such a  code. It required revelation al-  most every day. When this code  of revelations was given, after  the Church was organized, with  Prophets, Apostles, Seventies, High  Priests, High Councilors, Elders and  Teachers, it was not particularly  necessary while those revelations were  before the people that the Lord should  give special written revelation to  President Young, though the latter  had revelations. He had the power  and Spirit of God with him; it was a  living witness day by day to guide and  direct him in all the works which he  had to perform here in the flesh. What  he accomplished had shown this. He  (the speaker) wanted to make these re-  marks because he did not know to what  extent the minds and feelings of the  Latter-day Saints might be led in these  channels.    The God of heaven had not forsaken  the Presidency of this Church. He  had not closed the heavens against  them nor those associated with them.  His Spirit and power were with this  people, and would never be withdrawn  from them up to the time of the coming  of the Son of Man.    President Woodruff next adverted to  some of the early missionaries of the  Church, including Orson Pratt, Parley  Pratt and Orson Hyde, who were or-  dained Elders and sent forth to work  in the Lord's vineyard and to warn  the world. They held the Priesthood,  they had authority to preach the Gos-  pel of Christ to the children of men.  He asked the congregation, had not  Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God,  backed up the testimony which had  been borne by these men and scores of  other missionaries since their day?  Where would Utah and its inhabi-  tants have been today but foh Latter-  ter-day Saints? It would have been  a barren desert, just as they found it  on the 24th of April [July], 1847.    Turning to the subject of the Priest-  hood, the speaker remarked that they  could trace the history of Israel, the  dealings of God with men, from the  time of Father Adam down.  Not an iota of evidence could  be adduced proving that a man  ever went forth, called of God, and suc-  cessfully preached the Gospel of Christ  without he bore the Holy Priesthood.  The Lord had chosen the weak things  of the earth to confound the wise.  This had been the nature of His deal-  ings with men in every age, and thus  it was that humble men had been  called in this last dispensation of the  fullness of times to go forth and warn  the generations in the midst of which  we stood today.    Great responsibilities rested upon the  shoulders of all Latter-day Saints, and  the leaders of Israel would be held re-  sponsible before high heaven in the  day of judgment for the manner in  which they exercised their Priesthood.  He advised the Saints to read section  121 Doctrine and Covenants, relating  to the Lord's answer to the Prophet  Prophet Joseph's prayer. This was,  he said, one of the mightiest revela-  tions that God had ever given to man,  and it had been fulfilled. The Lord  had said, "Many are called but few  are chosen." Why was this? Be-  cause their hearts were set so much  upon the things of this world. The  rights of the Priesthood were insepar-  ably connected with the heavens, and  the heavens could be controled only on  the principles of righteousness. The  people would understand this. The  Lord would not withdraw himself from  this work, for He had set His hand to  fulfil the promised made through the  mouths of inspired men.    Some of the brethren on the previous  day bore testimony that this Church  was the work of God. They certainly  would not be qualified to preach  the Gospel and undertake to  build up Zion if they did not  know this. And how did they know  it? By the revelations of Jesus Christ,  by the inspiration of Almighty God,  that Spirit which belonged to every  man who was faithful to his covenants.  The testimony that we had in our day  a[n]d generation was the same as was  given in every age of the world.    Speaking next of the gifts and graces  which had attended this Church and  those who labored in it both at home  and abroad, President Woodruff said  he did not refer to this in any mere  spirit of boasting. No member of this  Church could undertake to preach  to the people unless moved  upon by the inspiration of God.  What man was there that ever  arose to speak on the stand who  knew before hand what he was going  to say? If anyone else did, certainly  he himself did not. These principles  were before them, and they knew them  to be true. He prayed to God his  Heavenly Father that their hearts might  be united. He could say for himself  that if the inspiration of the Holy  Spirit had not been with him, he would  have been in his grave years ago, and  hundreds more with him. If the Lord  had not been with him in his travels  many a time he would have been lost.  President Woodruff in this connection,  mentioned a remarkable incident. On  one occasion he said he was in charge  of a company of Saints numbering up-  wards of one hundred. They had en-  gaged passage on a steamboat at Pitts-  burg; but the Spirit of God said to him,  "Do not go," and but for that the en-  tire company would doubtless have  been lost. They did not go, but went  by another boat. The one by which  they were to have gone took fire at  night some five miles down the river  and all on board were lost either by  fire or water. So the Spirit of God had  been with them all through this work.    It was the duty of all to pray, and  one of the requests which he had to  make of the Latter-day Saints was to  be a prayerful people. They did not  pray enough. They should go before  the Lord in their secret place and plead  with Him to guide and direct them in  all the affairs of this transitory life.  When the prayers of 100,000 Latter-  day Saints reached the Lord they  were always heard and answered.    The Lord would build up Zion. He  would establish His work and  gather Israel together. They had to  warn the world, so that all would be  left without excuse in the day of  judgment. The earth was heavily  burdened with the sins of its inhabit-  ants, and they were even increasing,  causing pain and affliction on every  hand. But before the judgments came  the Lord had raised up men to warn the  world, and he prayed that those warn-  ings would not be without effect.

I will say I  feel highly honored to be  considered worthy of being  called to aid in promulgating  the Everlasting Gospel.

 THE DESERET WEEKLY. 561    history, that Cyrus pursued this  course all his life. Whenever he  took a city he went and offered  sacrifice to the great God, the God  of heaven. You may trace this  through the whole history of the  world until the present hour  and you will find that that  God who sits enthroned on  high has governed and controlled  all these things. He will do the  same today. That same God has  set His hand to fulfill the volume of  revelations contained in these rec-  ords of divine truth, which portray  the winding-up scene of the work  and Kingdom of God in the last  dispensation and fulness of times.  Our Heavenly Father called His  servant Joseph Smith. He laid the  foundation of this Church and  Kingdom, and he organized the  Church with prophets, apostles,  pastors, teachers, gifts and graces,  for the perfecting of the Saints, for  the work of the ministry, and for the  edifying of the body of Christ, until  we all come to the perfect stature of  a man in Christ Jesus, in fulfillment  of the revelations of God. Our num-  bers are few, it is true; but the peo-  ple of God always were few in every  age of the world. Noah, after  preaching 120 years, while building  the ark, only succeeded in saving  eight souls out of all the inhabitants  of the earth. [##Genesis 6-7##] The rest were destroyed  by the flood, and they were shut up  in prison and there visited by Jesus  Christ, the Son of the living God.   While his body lay in the tomb three  days His spirit went to preach  to those spirits that were in prison,  that they might be judged accord-  ing to men in the flesh. [##1 Peter 3:19-20##] The work  of the Lord always has been an up-  hill business so far as laboring among  the children of men is concerned.  But there is no person who believes  in the Bible can deny that the Lord  has proclaimed that in the latter  days He would set His hand to build  up His Church and Kingdom, He  would gather together His people,  and He would send an angel flying  through the midst of heaven, having  the everlasting Gospel to preach un-  to every nation, kindred, tongue  and people under the whole heav-  ens, crying with a loud voice: "Fear  God and give glory to Him; for the  hour of His judgment is come."  This was the proclamation of the  angel of God who delivered the Gos-  pel of Christ to Joseph Smith. "The  hour of His judgment is come." [##Joseph Smith-History 1:44-45##] So  say we. We have been called upon  to warn the nations. We have been  called to go forth without purse or  scrip. We have had to travel abroad,  swim rivers, wade swamps, travel  on foot, and visit the nations of the  earth in various ways, to preach the  Gospel unto them. We have been  obliged to do this, for we have been  called to do it, whether we were  popular or unpopular. If we had  not done this, we would have been  condemned; the Lord would have  cut us off and raised up a people that  would perform His work. These  thousands of Elders, gathered out  from the nations of the earth, upon  whose shoulders rests this Priest-  hood, are the instruments in the  hands of Almighty God, and  are called to go forth to warn  this generation; and their testimony  will rise up in judgment against this  generation and condemn them, and I  declare it in the name of Jesus Christ,  as an Apostle of the Lamb of God in  this day and age of the world. I  say there is not a nation under hea-  ven, there is not a king, a prince or  a president, or any other man who  has power over the sons of men, but  should give unto their subjects the  privilege of worshiping God accord-  ing to the dictates of their own con-  sciences. These subjects are the  creatures of God, they are the chil-  dren of God. They are placed here  on the earth and are responsible to  God Himself for their religion, for  their faith and for their worship.  They are not responsible to the em-  perors, or kings, or presidents, or  governors who rule over them.  Every man is responsible for the  course he pursues before the Lord.  And God will bless no king, no em-  peror and no president who will not  give unto his subjects the rights and  privileges in their relationship to  God which the Father Himself has  given unto them. Whenever these  subjects are deprived of their rights,  those who preside over them are  held responsible.    We are here upon a mission. This  is not our home. This is not the  place where we expect to dwell for-  ever. We are going into the spirit  world. I have been associated with  the Church for 57 years. I  was intimate with the Prophet  Joseph Smith and those that laid  the foundation of this Church, who  were martyred for the word of  God and testimony of Jesus. They  today are in the spirit world, ming-  ling with the Gods, where they can  plead for their brethren. So too  shall we go in our day and time.  In view of this can I afford to reject  the gospel, or to turn away from  that which the Lord has required  at my hands, because it does not  suit the world? I cannot. I have  got to meet my acts before the  throne of God, and so have this  nation and all the inhabitants of [t]he  earth. They will understand then  that there is a power above them, and  that is the God of heaven. All  men have got to appear at the  judgment seat of Christ. And when  men shed the blood of the righteous  because they follow the words of the  Lord, they have to pay for it.  No man can shed the blood of the  righteous without it costing him  something. It was so in the days  of Jesus Christ. No man was more  unpopular on the face of the earth  then Jesus Christ was from the  day He was born until He ascended  into heaven. All Jerusalem was  against Him. The Jews were  against Him. The Gentiles were  against Him, in a great measure.  They cried out against Him and  accused Him of everything that was  wrong, and labored very hard to  find some accusation against Him  whereby they might put Him to  death. It is true that the Gentile judge  who heard the testimony against  Jesus told the Jews: "I find no fault  in this man," and he washed his  hands, saying, "I am innocent of  the blood of this just person: see you  to it." All right, said they, "his  blood be on us, and on our child-  ren." [##Matthew 27:22-25##] How little did those Jews  know what it would cost them to  shed the blood of Jesus Christ.  Well might the Son of God, while  on the cross, cry out, "Father, for-  give them; for they know not what  they do." [##Luke 23:34##] Strange language for a  man that was expiring on the cross!  Why did He say this? He knew  what would be the result to the  Jewish nation for the next two  thousand years. Whenever the na-  tions of the earth have taken a  stand against the Gospel of Christ  or the people of God, they have had  to pay the bill. It has cost some-  thing to shed the blood of Joseph  Smith and Hyrum Smith, and the  price is not fully paid yet.    While the world look upon us as  a strange people, while they have  no faith in us or in our teachings,  and while they have no faith in  the Bible which they profess to be-  lieve in, still their unbelief will  not make the truths of God without  effect. The inhabitants of the earth  know not what awaits them. The  Lord is going to cut short His work  in righteousness. If He did not no  flesh would be saved. As I have  said before, we have been called  upon to warn this generation.  How was it when we first  went to New York, to Phila-  delphia, to Boston, and to the  various states of the Union? We  went there and found hundreds of  people who were ready to receive  the Gospel of Christ. We organized  churches throughout the United  States, north and south, more espe-  cially in the northern and middle  states. At that time there was not  the feeling that there is today. There  were a great many who were willing  to open their eyes to see, their ears  to hear, and their hearts to under-  stand. The Lord told Joseph Smith  that He had set His hand to prune  His vineyard once more for the last  time, and He commanded him and  others to go forth and warn this  generation to gather out the honest  and meek of the earth, and to pre-  pare for the day of His judgment.  And in one place in this book of  ##Doctrine and Covenants 86:1-7|Doctrine and Covenants##, in explain-  ing the parable of the wheat and the  tares, the Lord says: "Behold, verily  I say, that the field was the world,  and the Apostles were the sowers of  the seed; and after they have fallen  asleep, the great persecutor of the  church, the apostate, the whore,  even Babylon, that maketh all na-  tions to drink of her cup, in whose  hearts the enemy, even Satan, sit-  teth to reign, behold he soweth the  tares, wherefore the tares choke the  wheat and drive the church into the  wilderness. But behold, in the last  days, even now while the Lord is  beginning to bring forth the word,  and the blade is springing up and is  yet tender. Behold, verily I say  unto you, the angels are crying un-  to the Lord day and night, who are  ready and waiting to be sent forth  to reap down the fields; but the Lord  said unto them, pluck not up the  tares while the blade is yet tender  (for verily your faith is weak) lest  you destroy the wheat also."    Do the inhabitants of the earth re-  alize the judgments that hang over 
 the same gifts and blessings that the Savior and His Apostles possessed.    That was not alone my condition, but it was the condition of many men   who lived in those days. As I have said, God had an element prepared,   who had been ordained of Him to stand in the flesh in the commencement   of His Church on the earth in this dispensation, and this element the Lord   has gathered together in order to build up Zion, to warn the world, and to   prepare for the coming of the Son of Man. Brother George Q. Cannon  spoke this forenoon on the subject of revelation. When the Church was  organized nobody professed to have revelation; it was not believed in.    They had the Bible, and they did not want any more revelation. But I   will say to ye men of Israel, the Lord never had a church in any age of   the world that He did not give revelation to, and never will have. This   Church could not live twenty-four hours without revelation. It belongs   to the Priesthood and to the Gospel of Christ.    Brother Cannon spoke about the temptation of the evil one. There   never was a people on the earth whom the devil was more anxious to   tempt and to destroy than those who bear the Holy Priesthood. If any-  body supposes that the First Presidency and the Apostles and leading  men of Israel are not tempted, they are mistaken. If Jesus Christ was   tempted of the devil for forty days and nights, do you suppose he would   pass by these apostles and prophets? We are all of us tempted and tried   day by day. There is no people that the arch enemy, Lucifer, is more at   war against than these Latter-day Saints dwelling in the valleys of the   mountains. We all have to fight against this power, and shall have to   until He comes whose right it is to reign, with the keys of death and hell,  and binds Satan and sets a seal upon him. In my reflections sometimes I   feel that the Latter-day Saints do not comprehend our position, and the   danger we are in through being continually tempted and tried; for there   is a power constantly laboring with us to draw us away from our duties  and from the commandments of the Lord. The God of heaven holds me   responsible as the President of this Church, holding the keys of the Gospel   of Christ, while I dwell in the flesh. Can I live without revelation? Can   my counselors and these Apostles live without revelation? They would   not be fit to lead this Church one day without the revelations of God. I   am somewhat acquainted with the Lord; I am somewhat acquainted with   His ways and with His Spirit; and I know that God Himself, His Son Jesus   Christ, and all the powers of the eternal and everlasting Priesthood are exer-  cised over carrying out the great purposes of God upon the earth. These   revelations in the Bible, the Book of Mormon, and the Book of Doctrine  and Covenants have got to be fulfilled, and without we yield ourselves as   Elders of Israel to this work we do not magnify our calling before the   Lord. We have revealed to us in the Bible the promises that were made   to Joseph, who was separated from his brethren, and to Ephraim and   Manasseh. Their blessings were to prevail to the utmost bounds of the   everlasting hills. [##Genesis 49:26##] We to-day are in that very country. We have been led   here by the power of God, and that, too, by men who were governed and   controlled by revelation. Now, if there is anything on earth the devil   wants, it is to hedge up the way for the fulfilment of these revelations

No man can give to another, a knowledge  or a testimony of the truth, this comes through  obedience, and an effort on one's own  part to obtain a witness from the Lord.  The best way to get it, is to be placed where one  has to depend upon the Lord. J. F. S. 
 562 THE DESERET WEEKLY.    their heads? They do not, no more  than t[h]e people did in the days of  Noah, in the days of Lot, and in the  days of the Jews when they put to  death the Messiah.    You have embraced the Gospel.  How came you to be gathered here  in these valleys of the mountains,  in this once barren desert? Where  did you come from? You came  from England, from Norway, from  Sweden, from the various nations of  the earth and from the isles of the  sea. How was it that you came  here? You reply: An Elder of  Israel called. I heard him preach.  He told me if I would repent of my  sins, I should receive the gift of the  Holy Ghost. I believed him. I  went forth and was baptized. I had  hands laid upon me for the reception  of the Holy Ghost, and I did receive  the Holy Ghost. There was no de-  ception about this. I was moved  upon to gather with the Saints of  God to the mountains of Israel, that  I might stand with them and be  taught in the things of the Kingdom  of God, that I might stand in holy  places while the judgments of God  were poured forth in the earth.    That is why you are here. We  might have preached to you till we  had been as old as Methuselah, and  if the Almighty had not backed up  the testimony of these Elders of  Israel, Utah today would be as bar-  ren a desert as we found it as far as  the Latter-day Saints are con-  cerned.    This is the work of Gok, and we  are called upon to labor, no matter  what may appear around us, or what  persecutions we may be called upon  to pass through. This is the great  last Kingdom of our God that Daniel  saw. [##Daniel 2:26-47##] It is the Zion of God that  Isaiah saw. [##Isaiah 60##] It is the Church of  Jesus Christ that the Revelator  John saw.  [##Revelation 14##] The angel of God has  come and delivered his message, in  fulfillment of the commandments  of God, and the cry has been, Pre-  pare ye for the coming of the Son of  man; behold the day of God's judg-  ment is come. This is the procla-  mation to the whole world todayâ€”  Jew and Gentile. And this is why  we are here. We have been led  here by the inspiration and power of  God, and we have come here to ful-  fill the volume of the book of the  revelations of God to the inhabitants  of the earth. Therefore, I say, let not  your hearts be troubled. It is your  Father's good pleasure to give you  the Kingdom. These Latter-day  Saints are where they should beâ€”  where the Lord has called them;  and if we do our duty, if we  unite together and keep the  commandments of God, all will  be well in Zion. The Lord has  said: "Verily I say unto you, that  I, the Lord, will contend with Zion,  and plead with her strong ones, and  chasten her until she overcomes and  is clean before me; for she shall not  be removed out of her place. I, the  Lord, have spoken it." [##Doctrine and Covenants 90:36-37##] We have  got to do right and keep the com-  mandments of God. If we don't,  we shall be chastened, there is no  doubt about that. But while the  world are looking for the destruction  of this Church, they will look in  vain. They do not realize that the  judgments of God are being pro-  claimed by sword and by fire, and  that the Lord is pleading with all  flesh. The sword is bathed in  heaven; it will fall upon Idumea  and the world, and who is able to  stand the judgments of the Al-  mighty? [##Isaiah 34:5##] Those who are striving  for our overthrow, if they have not  faith today in this and in God, they  will have faith whenever they come  to judgment; for the whole of  them have got to go to judgment,  and they will be judged according  to their deeds done in the body.    Brethren and sisters, let us look  at these things as they are. We are  under great responsibility. In every  dispensation God has called men and  placed them as watchmen on the  walls of Zion. He told Ezekiel: "I  have set thee a watchman un-  to the house of Israel; there-  fore thou shalt hear the word at  my mouth, and warn them from  me. When I say unto the wicked,  O wicked man, thou shalt surely  die; if thou dost not speak to warn  the wicked from his way, that  wicked man shall die in his iniqui-  ty; but his blood will I require at  thine hand. Nevertheless, if thou  warn the wicked of his way to turn  away from it; if he do not turn from  his way, he shall die in his in-  iquity, but thou hast delivered thy  soul." [##Ezekiel 33:7-9##] We have been called upon  to warn this generation. We have  tried to do it in our weak way. I  have for the last fifty-seven years of  my life. So have these brethren  here. We have traveled thousands  of miles without purse or scrip. We  have lifted up our voices and  preached the Gospel of Christ to this  dispensation.    We are also called, brethren and  sisters, to perform some work in our  day and time that no other dispen-  sation of men have been called to  do. We have been called to rear  temples and to go into those temples  and redeem our dead. It takes as  much to save a dead man as it does  a living one. If the dead have not  heard the Gospel, the Lord is not  going to send them to hell because  they have not received it. The  Lord is the Father of all. He is  merciful to all, and He will save all,  except the sons of perdition. Every  man will have a glory. Our "Lib-  eral" friends here will have a glory.  A man will have a celestial glory  if he abides the law of the celestial  kingdom; he will have a terrestrial  glory if he abides the law of the  terrestrial kingdom; he will have a  telestial glory if he abides the law of  the telestial kingdom. That is the  law of God unto us.    Brethren and sisters, I have de-  sired to know the truth from the  day I was a child. I read the Bible  in my boyhood. I attended Sabbath  school under old Dr. Porter and Dr.  Haws. I read in this New Testa-  ment about Jesus Christ. I read of  what kind of a Gospel He preached  and what kind of a man He was. I  read about the Apostles and of the  power they had; how they laid hands  upon the sick and they recovered;  they could cast out devils, and, in  some instances, raised the dead. In  my boyhood I longed that I might  live on the earth till I could find a  servant of God, an inspired man,  who would teach me these princi-  ples that I read of in the New Testa-  ment. The Lord promised me, in  fulfillment of my prayers, that I  should live to see that day. I have  lived to see it. The Lord has called  a people from the nations of the  earth, from every sect, party and  denomination, to receive the fulness  of the everlasting Gospel. There is  but one Gospel. There never was but  one Gospel; there never will be but  one. Millions of people have been  born in the flesh, have lived and have  gone to the grave, who never saw the  face of a prophet in their lives; never  saw a man that was called of God and  had power to administer in one of the  ordinances of the House of God.  Will God condemn them because  they did not receive the Gospel?  Not at all. They are in the spirit  worldâ€”our fathers. We are called  upon, as saviors on Mount Zion,  while the Kingdom is the Lord's, in  the latter-days, to go forth and re-  deem our dead. We hold in our  hands the keys and power of their  redemption, by attending to the ordi-  nances of God for them. It is a work  that the Lord has blessed us with.  I thank God for this privilege. It is  one of the blessings that the Latter-  day Saints enjoy. When I go into  the spirit world I expect to meet my  fathers, my mothers, my relatives.  I have been in the Temple of the  Lord. I have received endowments  for over three thousand of them on  my father's and my mother's side,  all that I could get access to. I do  not want to go into the spirit world  to meet these people and have them  say to me, "You had power to enter  into these Temples to get redemption  for me, but you have not done it."    Lay these things to heart. Be not  afraid with regard to the work; only  serve God and trust in Him. You  cannot serve man, nor make flesh  your arm, for your salvation. If we  are saved, if we are delivered, if we  have redemption, it will be by the  power of the God of Israel. He  sent His Son into the world to lay  down His life for the redemption of  the children of men.    I feel to thank God that I have  this privilege of bearing my testi-  mony to the work. I know it is  true. I know Joseph Smith was  one of the greatest prophets that  God ever raised up in the earth,  save Jesus Christ. Joseph Smith  holds the keys of this great and last  dispensation and fulness of times;  he will hold those keys to the end-  less ages of eternity. He sealed his  testimony with his blood. And if  we have to do the same, what of it?  Thousands and thousands of the  children of men laid down their  lives in going to war, for the sake of  worldly honor. Is it any more for  a man to lay down his life for the  gospel's sake than it is for him to  lay it down for some other cause?  I say no. It makes no difference  what we are called to pass through,  if we are united and do our duty all  will be well. I want salvation when  I get through. I want to go where  my Heavenly Father and the Savior  are, if I can. I want to go where  the Apostles and Prophets are who  have borne the heat and burden of 
 than I can, so have not made  as much preparation as I would  have done, and as I am a poor man  will need help.    I have just been called to a 2  years mission in the Sabbath School   of the Ward. But if you see fit  to extend the time a little so I  can prepare and let me know what  part of the Northern States you  wish me to go I can better tell   how much means I will need to  take me to my field of Labor.

 and prophecies. It is in the hands of this people to carry out these   purposes of God as revealed unto us. Will we do it? Yes, we will do it.    Why? Because the Lord's word will always be fulfilled. All that has   been said with regard to gathering the people to Zion and what was to   transpire in Zion has been fulfilled so far, and not one word will fail. I   want the Latter-day Saints to understand this. You are here upon a   mission. So am I. So was Joseph Smith. Every one that has been born   into this Church had the privilege of coming here and receiving the bless-  ings of this Church and of the temples of our God. If we do not receive   them, it is our fault, and not the Lord's.    I have been strongly exercised in my mind in looking at the signs of the  times and what is taking place in the earth. I think of what the Savior   said to the Pharisees:  "Ye can discern the face of the sky; but can ye   not discern the signs of the times?" So I feel to say to the Latter-day  Saints, Can we not discern the signs of the times? When I look at the   wickedness of men and the terrible power the devil has among the children   of men I feel as though it should stir us up to righteousness and to the work   of the Lord. I have referred to the fact that I was twenty years of age   before there was a murder committed in the New England States. A   man killed his wife in New Haven, Connecticut, and it shocked all New   England. Old men and women and young men and maidens wept over   the idea of a murder being committed in the New England States. How   is it to-day? It takes columns of every newspaper published to record the   murders and suicides that are committed each twenty fours hours. People   are killing themselves to pay their debts, or for some other reason. And   this is increasing all the time. Now, my brethren and sisters, this terrible   rush to death that is in the world means something. What is the meaning   of it all? Why, the Lord said to Joseph Smith sixty-three years ago:    Behold verily I say unto you, the angels are crying unto the Lord day   and night, who are ready and waiting to be sent forth to reap down the   fields;    But the Lord saith unto them, pluck not up the tares while the blade   is yet tender, (for verily your faith is weak,) lest you destroy the wheat   also.    Therefore let the wheat and tares grow together till the harvest is fully  ripe, then ye shall first gather out the wheat from among the tares, and   after the gathering of the wheat, behold and lo! the tares are bound in   bundles, and the field remaineth to be burned.    Do the Latter-day Saints comprehend this? Think of the great changes  that are taking place in the world; of this dreadful loss of life, and also   of virtue; of the terrible cyclones, laying waste whole cities; fires devas-  tating towns and villages; earthquakes, storms, and judgments of every   kind. What is the meaning of all this? Why, these messengers that   have been waiting in heaven for a long time, holding in their hands the   sharp sickles, have gone forth in the earth and made a beginning, and   they never will cease until this scene is wound up. If you want to know   what is coming to pass in the earth, read the revelations of St. John as   well as those in the Book of Mormon and Book of Doctrine and Coven-  ants. Satan is busy. He knows that his power will be curtailed unless

 THE DESERET WEEKLY. 563    the day in their generationsâ€”Moses,  Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel  and all the Prophets and Patriarchs  whose testimonies we have in the  Bible, as well as those who dwelt in  this land.    I bear my testimony that this is  the Kingdom of God. As to perse-  cution, all men who live godly  in Christ Jesus suffer persecu-  tion. Why this combination  by priest and people against Joseph  Smith, an illiterate boy, as soon as  he was administered to by the an-  gels of God? Why did he wade in  deep waters up to the day of his  death? Why did he pass through  forty or fifty vexatious lawsuits?  Because he was a servant of God  and warned the inhabitants of the  earth of the judgments that were to  come. So it has been with all who  have followed him. If this people  were not the people of God, you  would not see a combination of the  inhabitants of the earth for our des-  truction. Are these Latter-day  Saints all the sinners there are in  the world? If they are, I tell you  the inhabitants of the earth are in a  good condition. But it is not so.  We sin enough, it is true; perhaps  too much; we are guilty of a good  many things, probably, that we  ought to repent of; I have no doubt  there should be a reformation among  us in some things; we do not pray as  much as we ought to; but we are  not so bad as the world call us by  any means. The Presidency, the  Apostles and these Elders of Israel,  our hearts should be united together.  We should labor with each other,  and for each other, and for the  benefit of the children of God.  We have tried to do that, in  a measure, I believe; but we  are weak. If, however, we will  do our duty, all will be well.    I pray God to bless these Latter-  day Saints. I know He will bless  us if we walk uprightly before Him.  We will conquer, we will overcome,  Zion will arise and flourish, it will  stand as appointed of the Lord, the  saints of God will be gathered, they  will stand in holy places while the  judgments of God are manifest in  the earth. I say to the Latter-day  Saints and to the world, watch the  signs of the times, watch the changs  that are going to take place. I tell  you that thunders, that lightnings,  that earthquakes, that storms, that  cyclones, that pestilence and that  famine are gathered together in the  heaven of heavens, and the angels  of God are ready to go forth when  the testimony of the elders of Israel  is closed. Messengers will visit the  earth that they cannot mob, that  they cannot destroy, because they  are the angels of God. These are  eternal truths, written like pages  of living fire upon these records of  Almighty God, and they will have  their fulfillment. Prepare your-  selves for the things that await us.  They are sure to come. No power  can stay the hand of the Almighty.  God bless us and give us inspiration,  light and truth, that we may be pre-  pared for that which is to come, for  Christ's sake. Amen.

I have two reasons either of which  I believe would excuse me for not  feeling able to respond to the call  on so early ^short^ notice.    The First is the very poor condition of  My Wifes health whom has been  very Ill and constantly under the  care of a Physician for the past four  months.    My second reason is that my Financial  affairs are in such a shape that  leaving them at so early a date would  necessarily expose me to Financial  Disaster. While I have good reasons to

 he can stop the progress of the work of God, and he is laboring all the   time to try and draw away the sons and daughters of Zion from the path   of rectitude and duty. Whenever half a dozen Elders gather together to   preach the Gospel, there you will find the enemy working hard against   them.    Brother Cannon also spoke about the First Presidency of the Church.    Now, the world is terribly afraid that the Presidency of this Church shall   say something to somebody about politics; and even some of the Elders   of Israel appear very much afraid that they will get some counsel on these   things. What are they thinking about? Politics should never turn the   heart of any man bearing the Holy Priesthood from his brethren or from   the cause of God. Let him enjoy his politics, and vote for whom he   chooses; but let all men stop throwing this filth and slime and pursuing   a course wherein God Himself and the angels are ashamed of them. It   makes no difference to me what a mans politics is; he has a right to enjoy   his own political ideas; but let this people realize that they are Latter-  day Saints and are held responsible before God for the course they pursue.    We should look at these things as they are. We hold in our hands the  keys of the kingdom, and God will hold us responsible for the use we make   of this power which He has entrusted to us. If we do our duty, we shall   prevail. We have revelation with us. True, the leaders of this Church   since the death of the Prophet Joseph Smith have not written many revel-  ations. Joseph Smith brought forth the Book of Doctrine and Covenants,   and it is a grand volume of revelationâ€”one of the most glorious records   ever given of God to man on the earth. But I want to say that Brother   Brigham Young did not live without revelation. He always had revel-  ation with him. He could not labor without it; he could not preach or do   the will of God without it. Nor can any man that occupies that position.    The Lord would permit no man to stand at the head of this Church unless   he was governed and controlled by revelation. We are feeble instruments  â€”weak worms of the dust; but God has chosen the weak things of the   earth to confound the wise, and to build up His Zion, and He gives us   revelation and makes known unto us His mind and will. We have a great   labor upon us at the present time in carrying out the purposes of the Lord   with regard to His work among the sons and daughters of Adam. I rejoice   that I have lived to see what I have seen. I rejoice that I came to these   valleys with President Young. We found a barren desert. What did the   Spirit of God say to him? He was urged not to stop here, but go on to Cali-  fornia. "No," said Brother Young, "I am going to stay right here. I am   going to build a city here; I am going to build a temple here; I am going   to build a country here." What did he say that by? By the power of revel-  ation, and he fulfilled it all. He performed a great work. He laid the   foundations of this great and glorious temple here, and we have lived to   dedicate it unto God. We have power to-day to go into four temples   and attend to the ordinances of the house of God for the living and for the   dead. Yes, we are opening the prison doors in the spirit world to thou-  sands and thousands of our fathers' households. Thus we are saviors upon   Mount Zion, whom the Lord has raised up in these last days to redeem the 
 Richmond Cache Co Utah Mar 7 1895    Pres Wilford Woodruff;    Dear Brother; I will now improve the  oportunity of answering your letter of inquiry as  to my going on a mission.  I feel it to be my duty  to state the circumstances that I find myself surroun-  ded by.  My wife was called from me by the summons  of death, leaving her children to my care and that of  my daughter.  I have striven hard with a sad heart  to keep them with me, that I might teach them in  such a manner, that the faith of the gospel may be  planted in them, and that they may honor their faith-  ^ful^ and noble mother, and become useful in the Kingdom  of God. By the wisdom and strength given me by  my Heavenly Father, I feel that I have been thus far,  very successful. Three of them are quite small, and  would be left without a father or mother's care in my  absence. My means are very limited, and my son  Charles is very anxious for the time to come, that he  may obey the call made upon him last fall, and  go on his mission. He will be ready to start in June 
 April 9 THE DESERET NEWS. 181    PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF    Said this was the fifty-fourth anniver-  sary of the establishment of the   Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day   Saints. He considered the human   voice a poor medium to convey the im-  pressions upon the soul of man. It  was a matter of impossibility in the  few moments he had to stand before  the people to ezpress his reflections  upon the things of God and the duties  of the Saints. There was a vast   amount of subjects of great interest to  us as a people. He endorsed the senti-  ments advanced on the subject of home  industries. He wished to say a few   words on the conflict between truth   and error, light and darkness. We   were in the midst of it and so were the   servants of God from the beginning.   It would be so down to the end of time.   This warfare commenced in heaven.   One third of the host of heaven rebel-  led against God and His Christ while   the two-thirds kept their first estate.  This made a tremendous number of   fallen spirits who were cast down to   the earth, without bodies, constituting   those evil ones who tempted those who   had bodies to do evil. Whenever there   were men on earth who labored to es-  tablish righteousness and introduce a  celestial law, these spirits worked  against them and influenced the ma-  jority of mankind to reject the ser-  vants of God. It cost the servants of   God their lives. It cost Joseph Smith  his life. This warfare would continue.   These evil spirits would war against  the Saints, against God, against Christ,   against His work until the time came  when Satan and his hosts should be  bound for a thousand years. But we   had the promises of the Lord for our   encouragement that this work should   stand. God had decreed that He would   establish His work in the dispensation  of the fulness of times never to be cast  down. There was no higher calling on  the face of the earth than to become a   witness for the Lord Jesus Christ. The  day had dawned when the God of hea-  ven had stretched out His hand to re-  store Judah and Israel, and set up His   dominion. Our business was to labor  for this cause. It had come here to  stay. Though the Prophet and Patri-  arch were martyred, and this people  had been driven, the progress of this   work had not been and could not be  stayed. The God of heaven required   us to warn this generation, who were  approaching a very important day and  time. A class of beings would follow  the Elders in their testimonies to the  world, beings who would command the  thunders and the tempests and the  destroying elements as witnesses to  the truth of our testimony and the  the truths we proclaim would rise in judg-  ment against the wicked in the great   day of the Lord.

THE SEMI-ANNUAL CONFERENCE.    FIRST DAY    THE Forty-seventh [forty-sixth] Semi-Annual   Conference of the Church of Jesus   Christ of Latter-day Saints, con-  vened this morning in the New   Tabernacle, October 6th, 1876, at 10   o'clock.    ELDER WILFORD WOODRUFF  said the gospel of Jesus Christ was   just as true to-day as it was in the   days of Adam, or as it was in the   days of Nauvoo. God never had   had a people on the earth, but what   he always held communication   with them through his servants   the prophets. The gospel had been   restored in this our day, as the   fulfilment of prophecy given in   the scriptures. The Bible was the   record of the dealings of God with   the Jews, and those revelations   given through John the Revelator   on the Isle of Patmos, pertaining to   the restoration of the gospel and   the plagues, pestilences, and fam-  ines that were to deluge the earth   in the last days, would every one   of them be fulfilled. The Book of   Mormon is a record of a portion of   the House of Israel that inhabited   this continent, and the dealings of   God with them through his ser-  vants the prophets. The Book of   Doctrine and Covenants contained   many revelations that God gave to   his servant Joseph Smith, many of   them having been given before the   church was organized. What made   Joseph Smith what he was, was   the power of God, and the Gospel   of Jesus Christ.    By the power of God this people   was enabled to receive the testi-  mony of his servants. By his pow-  er this people had been gathered to   this Territory. The once desert   plains we now inhabited had become   fruitful. By the power of God we   were here living in peace, and had   been sustained to bring about his   purposes. The word of the Lord   had gone forth that he would sus-  tain his people who had received   the testimony of his servants and   keep his commandments. If the   Lord had not kept his promise we   should long since have been scat-  tered before our enemies. Let us be   encouraged and pray for his holy   spirit to be with us, that we might   keep his commandments, for Zion   must be built up. The unbelief of   the world would not prevent the   fulfilment of prophecy, and unless   the people of this continent repent-  ed of their sins, believed on   Jesus Christ and were baptized for   the remission of their sins, they   would be visited by the judgments   of God, according to the predictions   of St. John. 
 [5 Apr, 2 pm]  [DNW 50:514-515, 4/13/95, p 2-3]  Afternoon Session, 2 p. m.  PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF  made a brief explanation as to how the  Church had been loaded with financial   burdens. He showed that it had been  mainly brought about by the ac-  tion of the general government in  seizing the property of the   Saints. Much of that which was   taken was money that the First Presi-  dency did not have in possession and   never had it. This action had entailed   the undertaking of burdensome obliga-  tions. He spoke hopefully in relation   to the prospect for the future, how-  ever, and exhorted the Saints to do all  they could to make the burdens of the   Church as light as possible by each   local division being as far as practic-  able, self-supporting.

 THE DESERET WEEKLY. 197    PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF.    Before the meeting closes I feel dis-  posed to make a few remarks to my  friends. I had a very pleasant inter-  view with Dr. Reiner at our office, and I  related to him a certain principle   which was presented by Joseph Smith   at a conference in Illinois, before some  fifteen thousand people. In speaking   upon religious liberty, he said: "If I   were the emperor of the world, and I  had control of all the human family,   I would sustain every man, woman and   child on the face of the whole earth,  in the enjoyment of their religion, let   that religion be what it may." I have   told the doctor that those were my  sentiments. They are my sentiments  today. I was much pleased with my  interview with our friend, and I have  been pleased with his address here to-  day. I do not feel to find any fault   with it.    I will say, for his benefit and any   others that may be present, that one  reason why we are strenuous in our  faith and belief with regard to this  being the Church of Christ, is because   the Gospel we have received is the Gos-  pel that Paul taught, and he said:    "Though we, or an angel from heaven,   preach any other gospel unto you than  that which we have preached unto you,   let him be accursed." Another reason   is that the gifts and graces which were   in the Church in the days of Christ and  the Apostles are with us today and  have been with us since the organiza-  tion of this Church.    Now, I have a favor to ask of this   congregation. This congregation is  composed largely of Elders and mem-  bers of the Church. There are many  Elders here who have traveled abroad   in the vineyard. Now, I say that many   of the gifts and graces and miracles   that were manifest in the days of   Christ and the Apostles I have seen   manifest in the Church of Jesus Christ   of Latter-day Saints, and so have you.  Whoever has traveled as an Elder of   Israel throughout the nations, and has   been true and faithful unto God in ad-  ministering in the ordinances of the   house of God, has had the power of   God upon him sufficient to receive those  gifts and graces at the hands of the  Lord. They have been with the Lat-  ter-day Saints. Now, I want every   Elder who has ever preached abroad,   and every man and woman who has  ever been present when any of these  gifts and graces have been manifestâ€”  when the sick have been healed, devils   cast out, the lame made to leap, the   blind to see, the deaf to hearâ€”I want   every man and woman who have seen   manifested any of these gifts and   graces that were in the ancient Church,   to raise their right hand. I do not want   anybody to bear testimony of this ex-  cept those who have seen it. -[In  response to this request, a large majori-  ty of the congregation raised their  hands.]- I have seen the sick healed. I  have seen devils cast out. The blind   have seen, the deaf have heard; and all  the gifts and graces have been with us.   While I was in Herefordshire I helped  carry a sister into the water who had   not walked for twelve or fifteen years,   and we baptized her. When we con-  firmed her she said she believed she  had faith sufficient to be healed. Presi-  dent Young and Dr. Richards called up-  on me and I told them of this case. I   wanted them to administer to her with   me in confirming her. We laid hands  on her, and President Young was   mouth. That woman rose to her feet,

 From the appearance of my affairs now, it will take  all the means we can gather to sustain him in his  field of labor and meet other pressing obligations.  I have briefly stated a portion of my condition of  affairs, and am now willing to leave the matter in  your hands. From my youth up I have spent a great  portion of my time in public service, helping in my  weak way to benefit my brethren and sisters and advance  the Lord's work in this part of his vinyard, and if I  am permitted to remain I expect by the grace of my Heaven-  ly Father to continue in the same noble work    You will greatly oblige me with an answer for  which I will be anxiously waiting.    From your brother in the gospel  Wm L Skidmore    If his son has been called, which  I did not know, the Father should  be excused, at least until his  son returns home.

 W. WOODRUFF'S ADDRESS,    TO THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS.    I deem it to be a duty which I owe to God and his church, to express my feelings  and bear my testimony unto you, concerning certain things that are presented to   you for your consideration; especially, the claims of elder Sidney Rigdon to the   exclusive right to lead and govern the church of Latter-day Saints. I have care-  fully examined the trial which elder Rigdon has had before the authorities of the  church in Nauvoo, as given in the Times and Seasons, Vol. v. No. 17, and I am   satisfied that a righteous decision has been given in his case. I do not make these   remarks without my reasons, and I will hereby give those reasons.    I will commence by asking where has elder Rigdon been since he made his  flaming speech in Far West, which had a tendency to bring persecution upon the  whole church, especially the head of it? Has he stood by the side of the prophet  and patriarch as a true friend, to assist in carrying them through their trials, tribu-  lations, and persecutions; Has he walked up into his place as a man of God, and  stood beside the prophet as his counsellor? Has he in any way, been a pillar or   support to the church, from that day until this? Has he sustained the cause, and  used an influence to spread the work abroad since the persecution in Far West?   Has he in any way sustained the priesthood with dignity and honour, for the last  five years of his life? Or, has the prophet, in any point of view, leaned upon him  as a counsellor, a staff, or support, for the last five years? Or has the prophet   Joseph found elder Rigdon in his councils, when he organized the quorum of the   Twelve a few months before his death, to prepare them for the endowment? And   when they received their endowment, and actually received the keys of the kingdom  of God, and oracles of God, keys of revelation, and the pattern of heavenly things;   and thus addressing the Twelve, exclaimed, "upon your shoulders the kingdom   rests, and you must round up your shoulders and bear it, for I have had to do it   until now. But now the responsibility rests upon you. It mattereth not what   becomes of me." I say, has this been the case with elder Rigdon, in any wise.  No, no, verily no; but the reverse, until he had become like a millstone upon the  back of Joseph Smith, the prophet, seer, and revelator. And I hereby bear my  testimony, that I heard the said Joseph Smith declare, that elder Rigdon had be-  come like a millstone upon his backâ€”a dead weightâ€”and he had carried him long  enough, and must throw him off; and in my hearing requested one of the quorum   of the Twelve to bring him up before the Church, that he might be dealt with  according to the law of the Church, that he might be cut off as a dead branch, and  no longer encumber the tree, as there was sufficient testimony against him. But  through the pleadings of brother Hyrum Smith and others, he has been spared.  Elder Brigham Young has been his friendâ€”spoke in his favour, in consequence of   his age and former standing, hoping that he might reform, got the spirit of the   work, and magnify his calling. Upon this principle he has been sustained long,  until the branch became twice dead, and necessary to be severed from the tree.   Elder Rigdon, for the last five years of his life, has mostly been shut up in the   post-office; confined himself mostly to his own temporal affairs, manifesting but  little interest in the affairs of the church; and when any alarm or report was in   circulation unfavourable to the cause, if we could judge at all from the course he

 dead and give them a place and a standing in their fathers' house. Those   who were drowned in the days of Noah were shut up in prison for a long   time, and Christ, while his body lay in the tomb, went and preached to   these spirits in prison, that they might live according to God in the spirit   and be judged according to men in the flesh. [##1 Peter 3:19-20##] So Joseph Smith and Hyrum   Smith, David Patten, and others, who have laid down their lives for the   Gospel's sake, have gone to the spirits in prison and labored there; and   you and I are called upon to attend to the duty of the redemption of our  dead while we dwell here in the flesh. This is our work.    I feel thankful for the blessings we as a people enjoy. It requires that   we shall be humble. We want to remember our prayers. There should be   a great deal of praying in Israel; not public prayers alone, but every man   should go into his closet and there call upon God and ask Him to sustain   Zion, sustain the Presidency of the Church, and the Twelve Apostles, with   all men who bear the Holy Priesthood in the earth. Upon the shoulders   of these men devolves the duty to go forth and warn this generation of the  judgments which are to come. Yet our numbers are few, compared with   the fourteen hundred millions of people that dwell in the flesh. There-  fore, do not be afraid of getting counsel from the presiding authorities in   the Church. They will not counsel you wrong. They know better than   to do that. They are anxious for this people to be united. We have   received the ordinances of the house of God and have entered into cove-  nant to build up Zion, and that is what we should live for. For I tell you,  the God of heaven requires this at our hands. The devil has no power to   overthrow the purposes of God. The Lord is above him, and he cannot   go beyond what the Lord permits.    Brethren and sisters, this is the way I feel to-day. Eighteen hundred  years have passed away from the time the Apostles of Christ were put to   death and the Priesthood was taken home to God, and remained there   until He gave it to Joseph Smith, who was raised up to stand at the head   of this dispensation. Jesus said to Joseph Smith and those first Elders:    For thou art called to prune my vineyard with a mighty pruning, yea,   even for the last time. [##Doctrine and Covenants 24:19##]    They were commanded to go out and warn the world and to preach the  Gospel, so that their garments might be clean of the blood of all men.    This is our calling. I wish we were better than we are, and that we had   more of a disposition to do what the Lord requires of us. But we are   poor, weak men. Yet there are those among us that would go to death   rather than break these commandments of God which Brother Cannon   referred to. And well they might. It pays no man to sin. There is no   salvation or glory in it; but there is sorrow in it. If you occupied the   position that I do, you would be where some of the sorrow is manifest.    We hear occasionally of men going astray and witness the sorrow that   comes upon them when their eyes are opened to understand their condi-  tion. They would give everything they possess on earth if it had not   happened; but the day is past and they have to suffer for it. I am anxious   myself that all the Latter-day Saints will try to keep the faith while they   live upon the earth. Our lives are short here, even if we live to be one 
 198 THE DESERET WEEKLY.    and next day she walked several miles   in the town where she lived. It was a   public case, one that was known to   the whole town. Some acknowledged it  was a miracle, but said it was through   the power of the devil. Those prin-  ciples have been with us from the be-  ginning, and will be with us until the   winding up scene, as far as we do our   duty. We have this testimony before  us, and the same is manifest in any   congregation of the Saints anywhere.   Some time ago I met a man and a wo-  man against the Valley House here.    The woman said to me, "Do you know   me?" I said, "No, I don't." "Do you  know this man?" "No, I don't." "Well,"   said she, "he was born dumb, and   when he and I were baptized in Here-  fordshire, you laid hands on him and  his speech was given to him, and he  has been able to talk from that day to   this." I do not speak of these things   boastingly. We have no chance for   boasting, because any man who has  these gifts knows they are of God, and   not of man. I never saw a minute in   my life when I felt I had occasion to   boast of any gift or blessing that God   gave to me. Whatever power I have   received, whatever I have been able to  do, has been by the gift of God.    I pray God my Heavenly Father that   we may always live in that way and  manner that when we arrive on the  other side of the veil we shall receive   all those gifts and blessings that belong   to the Saints of God who have been   true and faithful in any age of the  world.  This people are called to preach   the Gospel. We have traveled to al-  most all nations. Thousands, upon   thousands have been brought into the   Church. Many of them are gathered   here in the valleys of the mountains.    We trust that the course we are pur-  suing may be such that we may be  justified before the Lord. There is no  doubt but there is opportunity to im-  prove in many of these things. With   regard to religion, every man has a   right to his religion. It is between him   and God; and it is between us and God.   Inasmuch as we do our duty, when we  get through we shall inherit all the   blessings that have been promised unto  us; and so will any people that keep the   commandments of God.

 224 THE DESERET NEWS. [APRIL 13, 1864.    Elder Woodruff spoke on the riches of the   Gospel.  The citizens of the world sought   after what they called wealth, and high places;   but there was no wealth to compare with the   wealth of the grace of God, and no honor like   to the honor of membership in the Church of   God. The safest thing for the people was to   keep the commandments of the Almighty and   to seek to possess the Holy Ghost. When   men violated the commandments, they were   easily purchased or the service of the Devil.   He encouraged home labor and on home pro-  ducts, the sources of true wealth and indepen-  dence. 
 W. L. Skidmore  Mar. 7 [18]95. 
 ELDER WILFORD WOODRUFF was   the next speaker. He alluded to the   departure from the true order of the 
 pursued, it had a tendency to increase trouble and disturbance, instead of decreasing   it. It is true, that elder Rigdon attended some of the councils that president   Smith held with the Twelve and others, before his death, while giving them instruc-  tions; but I heard president Smith say, that he came in without his wish or invi-  tation, as he had no confidence in him. Elder Rigden and his friends would now  claim, before the church and the world, that he holds the keys of the kingdom of   God of the last dispensation, above the Twelve, the church, &c. I am ready to   admit before the whole church and the world, that he does hold one key be-  yond the Twelve; one that they do not holdâ€”one that God never held, nor Jesus   Christ, nor any true prophet, patriarch, or apostle; Joseph and Hyrum Smith were  utter strangers to it. And if we can judge from his own mouth, according  to the testimony given on his trial, we would suppose that Lucifer, who made   war in heaven, was its author; and that it had been handed down unto   the present day, and with it elder Rigdon has unlocked his heart, and pour-  trayed before our eyes what was in it. What is it? Hear it, all ye Latter-day   Saints! Listen, O Earth, and judge the fruits of this Key. He threatens to  turn traitor, publish against the church in public journals, intimating that he would  bring a mob upon the church, stir up the world against the saints, and bring dis-  tress upon them, &c. Times and Seasons, vol. v. p. 650â€”653. This ought to be  a sufficient reason for any true hearted Latter-day Saint to turn away from him  with disgust, and treat all such men and principles according to their desert,  which is, to let them entirely alone; for a more despicable principle never ex-  isted in heaven, earth, or hell, than to prove a traitor to our God, our cause, and   our friends, and bring distress upon the innocent, and that too by turning against  the very cause that a man has spent a portion of his life to build up, and declared,   while in the faith, that it was true and righteous; for in all such cases there is   entirely a misrepresentation of truth and facts, in order to accomplish the intended  evil, while a true statement of facts would advance the cause. This same prin-  ciple was manifest in the case of Lucifer, Judas, Arnold, and many apostates in   this church, who, when they could not get their own ends answered, would   threaten to bring mobs upon the church, and in some instances have done so. I  would ask has Joseph or Hyrum Smith ever held such a key as this, or manifested   such a spirit as this? No, never; they have despised it in their hearts. President   Smith seemed to be sensible that such fruit was growing in the breast of elder  Rigdon; and if he had accomplished what duty appeared to present to his mind   upon that subject, that branch would have been severed from the tree before his   death; but through mercy it was spared until it has produced fruit which is evil in  its tendency, and dangerous to the welfare of the Church and Kingdom of God.    I would again ask, has elder Brigham Young ever manifested any knowledge of  the key above spoken of, or any spirit or disposition to turn against the church in  any time of trial or persecution from its commencement? Has he ever deserted   Joseph, Hyrum, his brethren, or the cause, in one instance, since the foundation of   this church? No, never, in one instance. He has always been ready to go and   come at the bidding of the Lord. He has not said so; but he has always said   come. He has set the example and led the way, until he has traversed sea and   land, at home and abroad, native and foreign countries, until he has borne off the  keys of the kingdom of God in connexion with the Twelve, with honour and dig-  nity, since they were committed to his charge. He has followed President Smith's   footsteps closely for the last twelve years of his life, and especially the last five  years; while elder Rigdon has, at the same time, been confined to the Post-office,   apparently manifesting no interest in the welfare of the church and building up of  the cause. The spirit of wisdom and counsel has manifested itself in the course   and deliberations of elder Young. He has not only had much experience with   president Smith, but he has proved himself true and faithful in all things commit-  ted to his charge, until he was called to hold the keys of the kingdom of God in all  the world, in connexion with the Twelve, was the first to receive his endowment,   from the hands of the prophet and patriarch, who have leaned upon him in con-  nexion with the Twelve, for years, to bear off this kingdom in all the world. And  they have done it with honour, labouring both day and night, making every sacrifice 
 hundred years old, compared with the great eternity before us. The dead   are there whom we have redeemed, and we certainly do not want to pur-  sue a course whereby we will forfeit the honor belonging to us connected   with their salvation. It does not pay for any man to lose his faith in   God, or to dishonor the Priesthood which he holds; but we should pursue   such a course that when we get through we will be satisfied with our lives.    We are in the midst of a world of sin and temptation. It is a constant   warfare with us. It was with the Savior. He was tempted all through   His life, and He is an example for us. Certainly we have never passed   through more than the Savior did, nor as much. But He through all His   life remained true and faithful to His Father and to His calling as the   Savior of the world. He prayed a great deal, and He mourned before the   Lord over the sins of the world. To-day He is in our midst. He is our   Advocate with the Father. He is watching over us, and He will do all that   He can for our salvation.    We have everything to encourage us. When you think of eternal life;   when you think of the heavenly hosts; when you think of those that have   gone before us, awaiting the final resurrection of the dead and the coming   of the Son of Man to wind up the scene and enter into His glory, what is   there than can tempt any man to depart from the Gospel of Christ? There   is nothing worse than for a man to yield to sin after he has embraced   the Gospel. We should labor against sin and temptation.    I believe this is all I want to say to you. I am glad to meet with you.   I do not attend meetings a great deal. But I am at my desk every day in   the week about 9 o'clock except Saturday, and when the end of the week   comes I am weary in body, and need rest. I always enjoy myself however,   among the Latter-day Saints in their conferences when I do attend. I   have traveled many years in this Church. Many of our fathers, brothers,   and sisters have passed off. We are left; but we shall soon follow them.    I pray God that He will give us power as His servants and Saints to  magnify our calling and walk uprightly before Him, that we may be saved   in the kingdom of God, for Jesus' sake. Amen.

 THE DESERET WEEKLY. 529    GENERAL CONFERENCE.    The Sixty-sixth Semi-annual Con-  ference of the Church of Jesus Christ  of Latter-day Saints convened in the  Tabernacle, Salt Lake City, on  Friday, October 4th, 1895.    PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF  said: I feel thankful, my brethren  and sisters, that I have the privilege  this morning of attending this Sixty-  sixth Semi-Annual Conference of the  Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day  Saints, with the Elders of Israel and  the Saints of the living God. My first  attending any conferences of this  Church was in 1834, and from that day  till the present, from time to time, as  circumstances have permitted, I have  enjoyed this blessing. And while the  Prophets, and Apostles, and Elders  and Saints of God, a grea[t]  many of them, and a number of them  who have assembled in these days, are  today upon the other side of the vail,  still other men as Apostles and  Prophets and Elders and members of  the Church stand in the flesh, follow-  ing in their footsteps. I feel thankful  to have the privilege of meeting with  the Apostles and the various quorums  of the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat-  ter-day Saints today. And while we  are together during this conference, I  hope and trust that we may all of us  have our hearts lifted up in prayer  and thanksgiving to God and ask His  blessing that we may be guided by  His Holy Spirit in whatever we are  called to teach to the Saints, and the  labors we have to perform as the  people of God. We have great reason  to rejoice, great reason to be thankful  to our Creator, to God, our Heavenly  Father, for His mercies and blessings  over us today.    The hand of the Lord may very  clearly be seen, I think, by all men who  enjoy the Spirit of God, in the past  history of the Latter-day Saints. His  hand has been over us since our or-  ganization in 1830, until the present  time. We have passed, of course,  through many trials and tribulations,  but the Lord's mercy is over us, and  we are plan ted here in the mountains  of Israel, the Zion of God, and placed  here with responsibilities resting upon  us to be carried out in our day and  time. I am pleased to meet with the  Apostles, and trust, as far as we have  time and opportunity, we shall have  the privilege of hearing from them.  But I will say that President Snow is  expected to be absent from us for a  day or so, in attending the funeral of  Judge Smith, of Brigham City, and I  will call upon him this morning to  occupy a little time in talking to us. 
 THE DESERET WEEKLY.  509    President Wilford Woodruff.    Before dismissing this conference, I   want to say that to me it has been   the most interesting I have   ever attended. I have never before  seen the Latter-day Saints as ready as  on this occasion to spend the same num-  ber of days together in listening to the   teachings and counsels of the servants   of God. The Lord has said: "Whom-  soever ye bless shall be blessed, and  whomsoever ye curse shall be cursed."  I never cursed anybody in my life, and  I do not feel like doing so now, for my  heart is full of blessings to the Latter-  day Saints, to my counselors, to the   Twelve Apostles, to the Seventies, to the  High Priests, to the Elders, Teachers   and Deacons, to the Lower Priesthood  â€”all our brethren and sisters through-  out the Church.    I entertain the same sentiments as  have been expressed here by President  Cannon toward those who are not of  us religiously. There is a feeling of  friendliness toward us, I think, in   these valleys, on the part of those out-  side of this Church; they seem to feel  in their hearts to give us those rights  and privileges which belong to us,  under the laws of God and man. Some  of the judges have been ready to re-  ceive our testimony, our manifestoes,   and have seen fit to give and adminis-  ter righteous judgment. All such men  have my blessing and prayers, and  confidence. I feel that God will bless  them and all who perform their  duties with clemency in righteousness  toward their fellow men.

Thursday, April 23, 1896.    GENERAL CONFERENCE.   THE Sixty-sixth Annual Conference of the Church of Jesus Christ of  Latter-day Saints convened in the Tabernacle, Salt Lake City, at 10 a.m.,   on Saturday, April 4, 1896, President Wilford Woodruff presiding.    PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF.    Our hearts ought to be filled this morning with gratitude and thansk-  giving to God our Heavenly Father, for the blessings that we enjoy at the  present time, for the privilege of assembling this glorious morning in this  tabernacle, in the Sixty-sixth annual conference of the Church of Jesus   Christ of Latter-day Saints. If there is any man on the face of the earth   who ought to be thankful, who ought to have gratitude, who ought to be

Removed him to the nations  grantors, this afternoon. Through  the blessings of the Lord, he can  now walk around; his arm is  doing well, but he will have to  be treated for many weeks to   come. If all continues favorable,  the injured member will be of  much use.    Bro. James Jack  kindly furnished me the money  to pay hospital expense; 
 554 THE DESERET WEEKLY.    pany. We had in Zion's Camp two   hundred and five souls. We had in the  Pioneer Camp one hundred and forty-  five, I believe. And I can testify be-  fore God, angels and men that the same   power, and the same spirit of revela-  tion were manifest in his work  up to the day of his death as   were manifest in the work of the Proph-  et Joseph. It is true, Joseph Smith's  life was short. The Savior labored   only three and a half years, after He  entered into the ministry, before He   was crucified. The Prophet Joseph   labored fourteen years before He was   martyred. President Brigham Young  lived longer. He led this Church   quite a number of years. I was with  him when he came into this valley. I   was in the same carriage with him.   He was taken sick on the Weber. A  number of the camp were taken sick,   caused, no doubt, by the change in   coming to these mountains from the   region we had left. He began to re-  cover from the hour that he entered  into this valley. He came here, and   what did he do? I will name a few   circumstances. He pitched camp   some distance southeast of here. The  next morning he and the Twelve who  came with him took a walk. He had   been quite feeble, but he was then able  to walk with the assistance of his staff.  We walked along until we came to this   Temple Block. It was covered with   sagebrush. There was no mark to in-  dicate that God ever intended to place   anything there. But while walking  along Brother Brigham stopped very   suddenly. He stuck his cane in the   ground and said, "Right here  will stand the great Temple   of our God." We drove a stake   in the place indicated by him, and that   particular spot is situated in the middle  of the Temple site. One of the first   things President Young did after he  got here was to order the preparing of  a block down here, called the Old Fort,  where the camp could gather to. This  country then was very desolate, cov-  ered with wild sage, and that pretty   near dead, too. There was hardly any-  thing here with life, owing to the ex-  cessive dryness. We went to work and   surrounded this ten acre block to pre-  serve ourselves; put adobie walls on   three sides and log cabins on the east  side. This was the wisdom displayed  by President Brigham Young all his  life -- care and caution, and safety for  the people. He then went to work and   laid out this city. There was not a   living soul in this valley excepting a  few Indians who would eat roasted   crickets for their dinner. He laid out   these streets, these sidewalks, these  blocks. He laid out this Temple block  here. A number of councils were had  with regard to it. Brother George A.  Smith was very anxious that we  should have forty acres instead of ten;  so much so that there was a vote taken   to lay forty acres out. After-  wards President Young thought ten  acres in a city of this kind was   all that should be devoted to an   interest of this character. So Brother  George A. Smith surrendered his  views, and we all voted for ten acres.   When the city was laid out and these   other arrangements made we returned  to Winter Quarters, where President   Young got his family and returned   with them and some of the Saints; and  two or three companies followed the  same season.    I name these things for the benefit   of those who consider that there has  been no growth in the Church and   Kingdom of God since the death of the  Prophet Joseph. President Young  laid the foundation of four Temples in   this Territory. Three of these Temples   are now in operation, and the other is   being built right here. The Latter-day   Saints have gone to work and labored   in these Temples by the command-  ment of God, for the blessing of the  living and redemption of their dead,   and a million of men and women,  whose bodies are returned to dust, and  whose spirits are in the spirit world,   have received the benefits of the Gos-  pel by the power of God and the work   of the Elders, under the direction of   President Young. Is this a  loss of prestige? Is there no   hand of God in this? Is there no pro-  gress in this?" These things certainly   were not accomplished in the life of  Joseph Smith, although Joseph Smith  received revelations with regard to  Temples, and the ordinances and en-  dowments afterwards administered in  the Temple at Nauvoo. He also built   the first Temple, in Kirtland, and   many blessings were revealed in that  Temple, and this work was continued   while he lived, as far as he had the   power. I remember well the first  time I read the revelation given  through the Prophet Joseph concern-  ing the redemption of the dead -- one of   the most glorious principles I had ever  become acquainted with on earth. To   think that I and these Latter-day   Saints could go forth into the waters  of baptism and redeem our fathers, our  mothers, and those that have gone be-  fore us, in the lineage of our father's   house, and they come forth and re-  ceive a part in the first resurrection!   Well might the Prophet say God has  fulfilled His promise that in the last   days He would raise up saviors upon   Mount Zion, and the kingdom should  be the Lord's. Never did I read a  revelation with greater joy than I did   that revelation. I have often re-  ferred to the course we pursued  in connection with that. Joseph  Smith himself (many of you may recol-  lect the time) went into the Mississippi   river one Sunday night after meeting,   and baptized a hundred. I baptized   another hundred. The next man, a few  rods from me, baptized another hun-  dred. We were strung up and down   the Mississippi, baptizing for our dead.   But there was no recorder; we attended   to this ordinance without waiting to  have a proper record made. But the   Lord told Joseph that he must have   recorders present at these baptisms --  men who could see with their eyes and   hear with their ears, and record these  things. Of course, we had to do the   work over again. Nevertheless, that  does not say the work was not of God.    Well, the Lord manifested a great   work in the labor of Brigham Young.  He filled these mountains here for a   thousand miles, under His direction,  with cities, towns and villages. He  gave counsel in all these things. Brig-  ham Young was the architect of   this building (the Tabernacle). He   was the architect of the Temple that  we are building here. I say to the  Latter-day Saints that God was with  him. He was with John Taylor. He  has been with Wilford Woodruff. He  will be with those that follow me; for  the Lord will never permit this people   to be led only by the revelations of   Jesus Christ. He will be with these  Apostles of the Lord, and will con-  tinue with them until the coming of   the Son of Man. These things are  true. Zion will arise, and grow, and  flourish; the glory of God will rest   upon her, and the Lord Almighty will  fulfil all the promises that He has  made concerning His work in the last  dispensation and fulness of times.  The spirit of inspiration was with   Brigham Young from the day that he  entered into this work till he laid down  his life here upon his bed. I bear my   testimony to these things. There  never has been a time, either in these  Temples or anywhere else, but the   Lord has made manifest His will on   any point on which light was desired.   To my certain knowledge the Lord  gave revelations in St. George Temple  to His servants there, upon points of   doctrine we did not understand.   President Young was there. I was  there. Brother McAllister and others   labored there; and we knew these things.  So I say there is no man that goes into  these Temples to labor, or goes into the   vineyard of the Lord to labor, who, if   he will live his religion and do his duty,   will fail in receiving the mind and   will of God. Yes, the Lord has raised   up saviors upon Mount Zion, and the  kingdom is the Lord's. It is His work.   And we have the great power as   Latter-day Saints to go into these  temples and redeem our dead, and at-  tend to ordinances for them that they  never heard of in their day and gener-  ation. What will be the condition of   these saviors upon Mount Zion? These  Saints of the Lord will hold the keys of  salvation to their Father's house to the  endless ages of eternity. There never  will be a time when that power will be  taken from them. We ought to realize  these things, and we ought to prize the  blessings which God has put in our   hands. I had a great desire, when that  revelation was given, for the redemp-  tion of my Father's house. Father   Smith was the first patriarch to the  Church. He was a literal descendant   of Joseph who was sold into Egypt.   When he laid his hands upon men's   heads the spirit of blessing and of   prophecy rested upon him. He told   me that I should bring all of   my father's house into the Church.   I dwelt upon that with a great deal of  interest; and the first time I visited   my father's house, although it was  several years after this, I baptized him  into this Church, and my stepmother,   and my sisters, and everybody that  was in my father's house, even a   Methodist class-leader who was board-  ing there. I organized a branch of the   Church in Farmington, Connecticut,  and almost all of the members were   my relatives. I afterwards brought  my father up here, where he died, and  his body lies in the cemetery.    There are a great many things con-  nected with these matters that I feel to  rejoice in. The more light we have,  the more revelations of God we have,  the more we shall prize these privi-  leges. It is a great blessing that we   stand in the flesh in this last dispensa-  tion and fulness of times; and where   we can open our hearts to understand  these blessings, all of us will labor, as   far as we have opportunity, to attend  to this duty for our dead. I do not 
 required of them; leaving their homes, families and country, to establish the work   of God, and lay the foundation for the deliverance and redemption of Israel. And  I can say with every sentiment of my heart, and feeling of my soul, as has president   Young, "that if there are but ten men left, who hang on to the truth, to Joseph and   the temple, and are willing to do right in all things, let me be one of that number."   If it cost me my life to defend the truth of the everlasting gospel of the Son of God,   and to build upon the great and mighty foundation which God has laid in this last   dispensation and fulness of times, through the instrumentality of his servant Joseph,   the prophet, seer, and revelator, for the pruning of the vineyard once more for the  last time, for the warning of the Gentiles, for the salvation of the honest in heart,   and meek of the earth, the building up of Zion, the establishment of Jerusalem, the  final deliverance of Israel, and to prepare the Saints for the hour of judgment which   is to come, and to secure unto the righteous an exaltation of glory beyond the veil;   I say, if it cost me my life, let it go; I want to be among the number; I am ready  to follow the example of those who have gone before meâ€”when my work is done,   I am ready to be offered, if necessary.    I had rather see ten men seal a righteous testimony with their blood, than to see one  man turn traitor, shed innocent blood and damn his own soulâ€”for the object in living and  labouring in the cause of God is to secure a part in the first resurrection, eternal life,  and immortal glory. A religion that is not worth maintaining at the expense of life is not  worth having, "for he that will seek to save his life shall lose it, and he that will lay   down his life for my sake, the same shall find it." "And again, I will prove you, whether  you will abide in my covenant, even unto death, saith the Lord." Many of the patriarchs,   prophets, Jesus, the apostles, David, Joseph, and Hyrum, and many others, have sealed   their testimony with their blood.    Shall we then, as elders of Israel, or Latter-day Saints, back out, fear and tremble, or give   up the work, because elder Rigdon threatens to turn traitor or bring mobs upon us, because   he cannot make the church bow to his notion of things? No, God forbid. It shows very   clearly that he has not the spirit of Christ, for the Lord nor one of his followers ever did   such a thing; and it is sufficient to open the mind of every saint to see where he stands.    As far as my faith, prayers, influence, and labor, will effect anything, they will go to sus-  tain president Young, and in connexion with him the quorum of the Twelve, in holding  the keys of the kingdom of God, as they have been delivered unto them by the revelation  of Jesus Christ, and in the endowments they have received under the hands of the prophet  Joseph, and also all the quorums of the church as they have been set in order in the  church and kingdom of God in these last days, through the voice of the prophet, seer, and  revelator, who has been raised up and laid the foundation, and sealed his testimony with   his blood.    And I wish to say to all the elders of Israel and saints of God, that the time has come,   when we need a double portion of the spirit of Joseph's God to rest upon us, we should   gird up the loins of our minds. Watch and be sober, maintain the priesthood with dignity,   have the cause of God fully at heart, labor faithfully for its promotion while the day lasts,   for night will soon come when no man can work. We should practice virtue and holiness   before the Lord, and shun the very appearance of evil. We should enter our closets, and   call upon God for wisdom to direct us in every duty in life. Our object should be to   preach the gospel of Jesus Christ to this generation, and present those principles that will  save the souls of men.    If there is any man in this church that does wrong, that breaks the law of God, it mat-  tereth not what his standing may be, whether among the Twelve, the High Priests, Seven-  ties, or Elders, or in any other standing, there is a tribunal that will reach their case in  process of time, there is authority before whom they can be tried. Therefore let no one   turn against the cause of God, and stop in the road to destruction, on the plea that some-  body has done wrong: it is no excuse for you or I to do wrong because another does:   the soul that sins, alone must bear it. Should I step aside from the path of duty it would   not destroy the gospel of Jesus Christ, or even one principle of eternal truth, they would   remain the same. Neither would it be any excuse for you to commit sin! but I should  have to bear my own sins, and not the sins of othersâ€”so with all men.    Therefore, let me exhort all ye elders of Israel and saints of God to rise up in the ma-  jesty and dignity of your calling, make full proof of your ministry and covenant. Sustain   by your works the authorities, keys, and priesthood, of God in all its bearings and appen-  dages, through this last dispensation, for the eyes of God, angels and men, are over you,  and when the work is finished, you will receive your just recompence of reward.    W. WOODRUFF. 
 168 GENERAL CONFERENCE.    Elder Hedlock then spoke on the purpose of a general conference, and the ne-  cessity of unity of feeling and action, and of order in the conferences, remarking   that branches raised up since last conference cannot form themselves into confe-  rences without the decision of a general conference, and persons seeking to render  themselves independent of those who were appointed by the last general conference,   are out of order, and violating the laws of the kingdom of God. He remarked that  the presiding elders of branches should be associated with the officers of those bran-  ches in doing all things in righteousness for rolling onward the kingdom of God;   and also, that the presidents of conferences should be united with the presiding   officers of branches in the same great cause. Thus should all be united in the   great purpose in which they were engaged, viz., the salvation of the human family  The occasional offences that arise from individuals whose minds are too contracted   to grasp the sublimity of the subject of salvation, we should learn to endure, and  exercise forgiveness rather than raise an obstacle against the progress of the work.  He exhorted the audience to exert themselves to live as saints to day, and if such  was their continued purpose, they would not err very far from the path of rectitude.    The president then called for the delegates to represent the condition and stand-  ing of the conferences.    Elder Milton Holmes stated the Manchester conference to be in a very good con-  dition; the prospects, indeed, were very cheering, perhaps more so than at any other  period, and every thing seemed to foretell the reaping of a rich harvest. He ex-  horted the saints to listen to the counsel given, and bore a strong testimony to the  truth of the work.    Elder Leonard Hardy stated that he had not long been connected with the Pres-  ton conference, but the prospects to the best of his knowledge were much improved.  The officers in council were united, and there was a probability of some being bap-  tized. He also bore testimony to the truth, and prayed for the success of the  work.    Elder Elisha H. Davis rose to state the condition of the London conference,  which he said was very satisfactory at the present time. They had witnessed the   gradual increase of the church, and of very respectable people of the congregations  that were seeking after the truth. The officers were but few, but they were doing   good, and though the Saints themselves were generally speaking but poor, yet they  were determined to press forward and be united in the work of the Lord. The   spirit of the gathering was very powerful among them, many had already left for  Zion, and many more were very anxious to go. The meetings were well attended,  and some were baptized weekly, He requested an interest in the prayers of the  Saints, that he might be endued with wisdom and prudence; the enemies were on   the alert to detect, if possible, any thing that might be thought a false step, and   without the prayers and faith of the Saints, he felt quite incompetent for the task  devolving upon him.    Elder Galley stated that the Macclesfield conference, from the past year's expe-  rience, was much improved, and never had the Spirit of God given stronger testi-  mony of the truth than these last three months. The officers were united in  desiring the glory of God. He further stated that the conference was extensive as  regarded the distances of places, and that his circumstances in business did not   allow him to pay that attention to it which it required, that other labourers were   much wanted, and he requested that some travelling elder or high priest might be  sent amongst them.    Elder Robert Crook rose to report the condition of the Birmingham conference,   and we rejoiced much to see our aged brother manifesting almost the agility of   youth. He stated that he rejoiced much to see the Saints by whom he was sur-  rounded, and he rejoiced also at the condition in which he had left his conference,  their councils were in peaceâ€”unity and love prevailed amongst them. He also  rejoiced much in the late visit of elder J. B. Meynell, and thanked God for his   visit, and he was very sorry that he was leaving England, for he knew they were   of one heart and of one mind. He exhorted his brethren to be loyal subjects of the   realm, stating that he prayed for her majesty the Queen three times a day, until   the magistrates themselves declared him to be a most loyal subject. He also stated

 Salt Lake City Jan 28, [18]96.    President Wilford Woodruff-  Dear Brother-  It was with much pleasure, I   received my call to Scandinavia, and I might  say I anticipated a call.    At present I haven't a dollar but the  executor of my fathers estate. Mr. LeGrand Young  said he would do all in his power to help  me, and if the money is forth coming I  will leave on the 21st of March as stated.   If not I will be pleased to leave as soon  after as possible.    Very respectfully   Your Brother and Servant in the  Gospel,   Albert F. Young.    Joseph Warburton  Bishop  First Ward.

The Mgr. of  St. Marks, Mr Wallace, the  house surgeon, Dr. Brinley, the  head nurse, Miss Johnson, and  all connected with the institution,  have been very kind & obliging;   but for their care & assistance,  this complicated injury, would  not have progressed so favorably.

 To Wilford Woodruff and the first presidency  of the church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints    Salt Lake City December 1896    Dear brethren,    As every man that mostly works for day's  wages, so am I glad for your action to change the  Fast day to the weekly day of worship.    Yet I do not feel satisfied in one point,  inasmuch as you say that we shall bear testimony to each  other, for that seems to contradict recent teachings on  that subject: It is two years last Summer that  apostle Francis M. Lyman in a conference in Grantsville  gave us the following instructions:    That the Fast day meeting is not for preaching   nor is it a testimony-meeting, but it is essentially  for praying and confessing our sins before the saints.    I also heard him repeat this instruction at the next  following general conference of the church, and I accepted  his word as the Lord's and have sought to obey it, and He  also has heard my prayers. It was also given to me to   conceive how the other part of this teaching, if carried  out, would soon develop in a beautiful feature of our  fast meetings, wich might relieve them of the dullness, that  is creeping upon them. An hour spent in self-review   among brethren, what a blessing that might prove for those  that partake in it!    But one lone voice would not make a meeting  of that kind and one that might attempt to break the ice by opening  his heart before his brethren, would feel chilled and close up upon  himself again, if there was no response to his sentiments.  In other words, unless the meetings should be conducted  accordingly, one individual alone would hardly dare to  enter this field wich is an unknown country to most of us.   And I am sorry to state that in my wanderings in these 2 years  I have not seen nor heard of any move in this direction and now  your ruling seems to dispense altogether with the necessity to do so. 
 THE DESERET WEEKLY. 555    want to go into the spirit world and  meet with my progenitors and have  them say to me, "You held the keys of  my redemption and my salvation and   you neglected to do this work, and I  am not redeemed." I have labored,  with the assistance of my friends,  in the St. George Temple, for   three thousand of my dead friends  of my father's house and my mother's   house, and have done all that I could   for them. This is the greatest joy of   my life, when I look upon these things  and realize that I have had this privil-  ege here on the earth. And when I   lay my body in the tomb and my spirit  goes into the spirit world, I shall re-  joice and have glory with them in the  morning of the resurrection, inasmuch   as they receive these principles.  "Well," perhaps you may say, "what  if these people whom you have been  baptized for do not receive the Gospel?"  That will be their fault, not mine.  This is a duty that rests upon all Israel,  that they shall attend to this work, as   far as they have the opportunity here   on the earth.    Brethren and sisters, I felt as though  I wanted to bear this testimony to the  Latter-day Saints. The Lord has  manifested this work from the day that   Joseph Smith received the records of  the stick of Joseph in the hands of   Ephraimâ€”the Book of Mormon. From  that day until this there has been no  time that the Lord has forsaken His   Church. We have been persecuted, we   have been afflicted, and we have passed  through serious trials in our day; but   the Lord has carried us through all   these things. And we are here in the   midst of the everlasting hills, given by  revelation to old father Jacob, who laid   his hands upon the head of his son  Joseph and said that he was "a fruitful   bough by a well, whose branches run  over the wall," and that his blessings   prevailed above those of his progeni-  tors "unto the utmost bound of the  everlasting hills;" and these blessings  were to rest upon him and his posteri-  ty. These things have come to pass.   The majority of the Latter-day Saints   are through the loins of Ephraim, the   son of Joseph. Ephraim is "a mixed  cake." He is mixed among the na-  tions of the earth, and it is those who  have the blood of Ephraim in them   who, when they hear the word of the  Lord, receive it; and all that God has  promised through these Patriarchs and   their posterity will come to pass. So   with regard to Judah. Moses told the  Jews what would befall them. He   told them what would take place in  their Temples and in their cities. They  built altars to Baal and broke their  covenants, and he told them they   would be scattered and peeled, and de-  stroyed by pestilence, by famine, and  by the sword; women would eat their   own children, and a remnant of them   would be taken from Jerusalem and   scattered among the whole Gentile   world, and be trampled under  the feet of the Gentiles until the times  of the Gentiles were fulfilled. Those  words have been fulfilled to the very  letter as fast as time would admit.    We are in the hands of God. Our   responsibilities are great, and we   should try to magnify our calling, and  not set our hearts so much on the  things of this world that we neglect  any of the oracles of God or the work  of God for the living and the dead.   God bless you all. Amen. 
 LATTER-DAY SAINTS' MILLENNIAL STAR.    faithful to the God of Heaven and the Church and kingdom of God, it is  myself. When we look over the field in the last sixty-six years, and see   all that the Lord has done since the organization of this Church, the num-  ber who have passed away, and the many changes which have taken place,  we ought to be thankful for the blessings of God. Our history has been  a very peculiar one, and we have been called to pass through many events.   We have arrived where the promises of God in the revelations in the   Bible, Book of Mormon, and Doctrine and Covenants, by the voice of the   Prophets of God, are being fulfilled before our eyes, before the heavens,   and before the earth. We stand here to-day with this great and mighty   responsibility resting upon us as the Holy Priesthood and the Saints of   the Living God, to labor, and to be true and faithful to God, to our cove-  ants, to the Gospel of Jesus Christ, to those laws and principles which  God has revealed concerning the last dispensation and the fulness of   times. I feel thankful for these blessings, and hope that during this   conference the Apostles and the Elders of Israel and the people may be   filled with the inspiration of the Almighty God; that we might compre-  hend and understand the position we occupy to-day in the sight of heaven  and earth; that the Spirit and power of God may be with us, that we may   know the mind and will of God and rejoice together and be able to per-  form the things required at our hands. I ask God to bless the Latter-day   Saints who are asssembled in this conference, that these blessings may   dwell with us during these meetings, from henceforth and forever. Amen.

 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 169    that the Derbyshire conference was in a good condition at present, but much in  need of some active labourer.    Elder George Simpson stated that there was not that union in the Staffordshire   conference which was necessary for the well-being of the church, he hoped they  would take his conference into consideration, and that measures might be taken for   their assistance.    Elder John Banks stated that he had not had much time to become acquainted   with the Edinburgh conference, having only been there about three weeks. Edin-  burgh was a splendid city, the seat of much wisdom and learning, and it would  require much wisdom and prudence to be exercised; but considering all circum-  stances, he trusted that the coming year would yield them a rich harvest.    Elder Richard Blakey stated that the Garway conference had many difficulties  to contend with, but still it was in a better condition than he had known it before.  He should wish to call the attention to this conference as he was at present under  the necessity of retiring from his labours in the vineyard, in order to assist an aged   father, whose growing infirmities called for his help.    Elder James Houston stated that the branches in the Glasgow conference were   in a very prosperous condition, full of union and love in their counsels; Lanerk,   where be had been labouring, numbered 64 in about six months; he was sorry that  he was not better able to represent the whole conference, as its general condition   was most satisfactory and encouraging.    Elder James Ure briefly stated that the Sheffield conference was in a very cheer-  ing condition.    Elder E. F. Sheets remarked that the Bradford conference at his first visit rather   alarmed him, but he thought he could now state that it was in very good order,  and he knew not of a dissenting voice in the whole of the three branches of Bradford,   Idle, and Leeds; more labourers were wanted, and he anticipated much good   would be the result.    Elder Thomas Smith said in reference to the Worcestershire Conference, that in  its present condition, love and union were prevailing through the whole, with the   exception of one case of difficulty, which would come before the meeting. Brother  Meynell had been visiting them and they had an excellent time. The conference  spread over an extensive country, and it was their intention to labour indefatigably   in the coming season.    The meeting then adjourned until evening.    EVENING SERVICE.    The service opened by singing. Prayer by Elder Hedlock, when the representa-  tion of the condition of the conferences was resumed.    Elder Stratton stated that generally speaking the branches were in a prosperous   condition, that four new branches had been organized these last few months. The   Isle of man branches were in a much better state, united, and the prospects were  good.    Elder Speakman stated that the Clitheroe conference was in good standing, peace  and unity, and every good grace was to be found amongst them, none could be   more inclined to adhere to counsel. They were a people that were full of humility  which had caused him much to rejoice; they were also ever ready to assist in rolling   forward the kingdom of God, and they only need to be told their duty in order  to do it.    Elder John Johnson said he had not been in the habit of speaking before so large  and respectable a congregation, but rather in the regions of darkness, and amongst  the blacks of the coalpit. He was, however, glad to say that though Cheltenham  had, as it were, been torn up by the roots by persons who had never been sent there,   yet he rejoiced to say that now the people were willing to listen to counsel, and the   spirit of love and union was in their midst, indeed their condition was better than it   had been for three years, and there was a great work to do.    Elder Robert Martin said that the members in the Bedfordshire conference,   with very few exceptions, were Saints indeed, many of them were of long standing.   A good foundation had been laid, and the difficulties that had for a considerable time

 It is now the question with me: Is this an oversight  on your part or are there any reasons for making the advice  of bro. Lyman invalid? If not and if we simply do  not mind the one advice, is there any guarantee that we  will mind the other, though given by a higher authority?    The chances are, we will not do it, but carry out  on the Fastday the usual program of a testimony meeting,   that is: after the meeting is given in the hands of the saints,   some glibly tongued Elder will get up and â€” "for fear  of the time going to waste" â€” fill it out by loading us down  with enough precepts to go on for the rest of our lives, of   wich however we will not be more mindful, than he is  himself of what is becoming in a meeting.    Not that this testimony-preaching has been without  any results whatever: It has hushed the voice of our sisters  and minor members in our testimony-meetings. they now  always tell us, if we try at home to induce them to bear  their testimony: "Oh! I am not a preacher!"    Preaching, then, has come to be considered as the  main thing in our worship. But I sometimes wonder if  the Lord would not be as well pleased, if we pushed the  bigger part of it over board and put some more music  in its place. At least He says that He likes to hear the  songs of the saints, also their prayers, but I have not found  yet where He says that much about preaching without commission.    Now my brethren I hope you will not take this  letter as an evidence of faultfinding, for I can tell you,   although I believe you to be human and therefore liable to  make an occassional mistake, that I have full confidence  in you, enough for instance, that for my part I would  gladly have been left without the discloures â€” however interesting â€”  of the last conference as I never before thought this case  to be any of our business.    But this is a question that confronts me directly   while trying to carry out the will of the Lord as revealed  by His Servants and others may be in the same condition.   We may therefore look forth for an enlightemnent in some  shape from your source.    In the meantime I remain, with especial respect  Your brother  Albert Kropfli    [sideways text] Alfred Kropfl  Dec. 1896.    Kropfli, Albert  Dec. 1896 [end of sideways text]

 gospel by professing Christians. It was  almost impossible for them to believe   that continued revelation from the Al-  mighty was necessary. The faith of   the Latter-day Saints, however, was   that it is God's right to rule and dictate   by revelation. The law of tithing was  given by revelation, and no Saint could  neglect to comply with it and retain   the spirit of the gospel. It was the   duty of all to assist in building temples   in which to attend to ordinances per-  taining to the living and the dead.    None of the requirements of the gospel  would fall to the ground, for all must   be fulfilled. The speaker exhorted the  people to draw near to the Lord, that   he might draw near to them, and that   they might be filled with the light of   truth. He also bore testimony to the   greatness and the divine nature of the   latter-day work.

 170 GENERAL CONFERENCE.    troubled the churches were removed, and the principles are now much inquired after,  and he felt assured that with wisdom and prudence much might be done, especially  if more labourers were employed.    Elder Thomas Margetts stated that the Leicestershire conference was not in so   good a condition as he could wish to see it. The experience of the last six months   had been very trying, but after all profitable. When an aspiring spirit arises, it is   calculated to do much mischief; it had been so there, but the results he had no   doubt would be beneficial; but notwithstanding all things, the prospects were still   better than ever, and their congregations were crowded to excess. He earnestly   requested a visit from some of the presidency as early as possible.    Elder Thomas Smith stated that the Bath conference was in good standing,   union and love prevailed in their midst, the gifts and blessings of the Spirit of God   were abundant, the councils were conducted in peace and love, and the prospects  were very encouraging.    Elder William Walker remarked in reference to Hull, that when he was sent  there, he could not in his address say brethren and sisters, for there was but one   sister there. He continued his labours by preaching at the dock side to hundreds   of people, but apparently in vain. He was at times almost in despair, but never-  theless he received encouragement from the word of God, and continued his labours.  He remarked also that the books of the church had been a great instrumentality in   propagating the work in that neighbourhood. The prospects were now encourag-  ing, and the minds of the people were in some measure turned to the contemplation  of the principles of truth.    Elder Dan Jones, from Wales, rose, under an attack of the fever and ague,   and remarked that he believed it was the intention of the evil one to prevent him   speaking that evening, but he was determined to bear his testimony in spite of   every opposing power. He said that he came not in the character of a delegate:   he represented no conference; for if he had but baptized one, he should be able  to represent three. But he would speak of a nation renowned in history, one of   the most ancient nations of the earth, who had never been subdued, and to whom  he hoped to be instrumental in bearing the tidings of the work of God, in the last  days. He enlarged on the characteristics of his people in a manner, and with  an eloquence, that told how ardently he loved his native tribe and his father-  land. He remarked that, for many years, as a mariner, he had been in search of  the principles of truthâ€”he had sought it in almost every climeâ€”among the red  men of the woods, or the civilized denizens of the city, but he had found it not   until he came in contact with the followers of the prophet of the Lord, the noto-  rious Joseph Smith; but of that despised individual he would bear his testimony,   and though he might feel more at home among a tribe of Indians, or on the deck  of a ship, than upon that platform and before such an audience, yet he would not   flinch from bearing a faithful testimony to the character of the servant of the  Lord. He had been with him in the domestic circle, he had been with him in   peril and in prison, and only left him about an hour before the murderous deed of   his assassination was perpetrated; and he had now come in obedience to the coun-  sel of the martyred prophet, as a messenger to his native land, to bear testimony of   the work for which his brother had died, and which he had sealed with his blood.  [We would here remark that we are utterly incapable of doing anything like jus-  tice to the address of Captain Jones, for though delivered while struggling with   disease, such was its effect upon ourselves, and we also believe upon others, that   we ceased to write, in order to give way to the effect produced upon our feelings.]    Elder William Henshaw stated that Merthyr Tydvill conference was in a pros-  perous condition. Two years ago he first went there and met with much opposition;  but some became obedient to the gospel, and the signs followed the believers; gifts,   blessings, and visions were in their midst, and the saints were rejoicing in the ful-  ness of the gospel of Jesus Christ.    Elder Wilford Woodruff then rose to represent his conference, to which he had   pledged himself at an early part of the day. He said that he represented about   twenty-eight states of the American Union, above one hundred thousand saints, a   quorum of twelve apostles, the various quorums in the stakes of Zion, fifteen

 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 171    quorums of the seventies, a conference with two temples of the Lord, one long  ago completed, and one fast hastening to its completion. After enumerating  many other things, which, from the rapidity of his utterance, we failed to note,  he remarked that the condition of the churches in America was more encouraging   than at any former period in the history of the church.â€”The Saints were more   universally of one heart and one mind, and the Spirit of Elijah's God was in their   midst. He then addressed himself to the elders and officers by whom he was sur-  rounded, exhorting them in all cases to abide by the laws of the land, and, that  no man, by keeping the laws of the kingdom of God, need violate the laws of the  realm: that no one who infringed upon those laws in any manner would be sus-  tained by the authorities of the church. We had nothing to do with the laws but   to keep them. He further remarked that elders, generally, raised up churches   like unto themselves, and therefore it behoved them to be an example to their flocks   in all things that were holy and righteous. The kingdom of God was a kingdom   of order, and a spirit of order ought to characterise every branch of the church.  He rejoiced much in assembling with them that day, and in meeting such a vast  concourse of brethren and sisters as greeted his eyes that day: he rejoiced also to   find things throughout the land in so good a condition as they were. He further   exhorted the Saints not to be discouraged by their trials, but to contemplate the   course of the Saviour, from the manger to the cross; he sought not for peace   and popularity, but for the salvation of men. It was no sign, because men were  poor that they could not be useful and successful in propagating the principles of  truth; let us but remember from whence our power comes, and forget not, what   elder Ward often endeavours to teach us, that union is strengh, that the grand   secret of our success lies in being of one heart and of one mind; but, that on the   contrary, division stops all blessings, and closes the heavens against us. Yes, he   would say, the heavens were full of blessings for the Saints, but union and peace  amongst us could alone call them down upon us. He would, therefore, call upon  them, for God's sake, to be united in all things pertaining to the rolling onward of   the kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.â€”The meeting was then closed   with singing and prayer, and adjourned until the next morning, to assemble in the  large room in Bridge-street, at ten o'clock.    MONDAY MORNING.    The meeting being opened by singing and prayer, elder Woodruff proceeded to   speak on the great principles that should actuate the servants of the Lord, exhort-  ing them to lay aside all principles of selfishness, and act according to counsel. To   labour for the good of all, acting as one man before the Lord, in order to do the  best for the welfare of the kingdom of God.    Elder Hedlock spoke on the condition of the church in Nauvoo, how they had  suffered from time to time from unrighteous men getting into their society, who  had lost sight of the great principles of the kingdom of God,â€”and who sought   only to aggrandise themselves at the expense of the entire community. Individuals   had been amongst them at an early period, who had made extensive purchases of   land, which had been enhanced in value by the gathering of the Saints, and thus   they had taken an advantage of the people by disposing of their purchases at an  exorbitant rate of profit. They had also had to suffer from various repeated law  suits that had impoverished their resources, that otherwise might have been em-  ployed in providing labour for the poor. He had looked at their situation, and he  felt anxious for the adoption of some plan that might mutually benefit all. He was  desirous of preventing the spirit of monopoly from entering into their midst, and   while he now contemplated as it were the energies of the people being thrown away   amongst their enemies, he wished to adopt such means as should preserve amongst  themselves the combined industry of the Saints for the good of all. He then stated   his views of the objects to be accomplished, and the benefit arising from the pro-  posed scheme of a joint stock company, that should unite the efforts of the Saints  on both sides the water for the good of all. He stated that the shareholders would   be benefitted by the adoption of such a plan, inasmuch as the capital so employed,  by judicious management, would in a few years double its capital.

S.,    Dear Bro; Received your litho of recent  date notifying me of my acceptance by you as a missionary  to the Southern States. I am pleased to be deemed worthy  of the call and would respond at once if financial  circumstances would permit. Being the oldest of a large  family I have felt it my duty and have assisted my  father in maintaining them, untill two years ago when  I took my share of the debts which the family were then  owing, and began working for myself. I located a farm  of University Land which has since come into market and  for which I am obligated to make annual payments of  $12500 for the next four years. My farm is in such condition  that it needs some improvements in order to make it  pay its way during my absence. I am obligated at the  present time to the amount of $35000, including this year

 I also am organist at the largest  Parish church in Lincoln; St. Swithin's.  My position makes me feel very  uncomfortable as I am obliged to keep  the fact that I am a Latter Day Saint  a secret or I should be instantly  dismissed. My children have also to attend  the church Sunday School, which is  against our wish, but if they did not  the clergymen would soon make  enquiries about them. It also makes me  feel uneasy at having to teach their  doctrine to a certain extendt, although  I often put the Truth before them  and give them little bits of our Doctrine  although I do not say what it is.  Being organist also compels me to  attend the church services, which are  very repugnant to me and I have no  chance to attend our own meetings  on a Sunday. Sometimes the Elders  hold a meeting at my parents' house  (4 miles from here), on a week day  evening, and we attend and give our   testimony.    Some of my friends who know   that

 payment on my land, which amount is due within the next six months.  And which I hope to be able to liquidate with what means  I have on hand and part of my next seasons crop.  With the rest of my crop I could fit myself out and leave  my farm in such shape that it would pay its own  expences while I am absent. So that within the next  year I would be able to arrange my affairs so that I   can perform the mission desired. Therefore I would be  pleased to have the time extended sufficiently to allow me  to get my affairs into the condition stated. Hoping this  will meet with your approval and in consideration  of my circumstances you will grant me the favor  desired.

 172 GENERAL CONFERENCE.    remarked that there must be a channel of communication between the Saints on   both sides the Atlantic for the mutual benefit of all. He further remarked that   there were a variety of means by which these ends might be accomplished, by pro-  curing freight for ships, by procuring provisions for emigration form our brethren   in the West, which, placed in bond in this country, would be a great advantage in   the supply of sea stores to those that emigrated. He wanted also agents in all   parts of the country to assist in the business of emigration, by posting our bills  when we had ships in hand, and by procuring passengers, which would afford a  fair remuneration for labour on business-like principles. All that we wanted was   men of business to enter into this work, which must ultimately work for the good   of all.    Elder Ward then remarked that the great point before the meeting was, whether   the scheme announced in the last MILLENNIAL STAR to the conferences was to be   adopted or not.    It was then unanimously voted that such a plan or association as that proposed   should be adopted.    It was then unanimously voted that brothers Wilson, Caruthers, M'cEwan,  Brown, Clark, Milnes, Mason, Banks, Johnson, and Flint, resolve themselves into   a committee to draw up resolutions, to be examined and discussed by the conference,  and that they retire into the adjoining room for that purpose.    The brethren of the committee having retired, elder Woodruff called the atten-  tion of the conference to the various business lying before them in relation to the   churches.    Elder Woodruff first called for those brethren who were so situated as to give  themselves up to the ministry, when there arose elders J. D. Ross, James Ure,   Glaud Roger, E. H. Webb, James Houston, Robert Crook, George Slater, Thos.  Margetts, E. H. Davis, John Allen, J. A. Stratton, E. F. Sheets, William Walker,  C. Miller, Milton Holmes, Leonard Hardy, George Eyre, William Speakman,  Thomas Day, Henry Cuerden, G. P. Waugh, Dan Jones, William Henshaw, Wm.  Allen, Thomas Smith, (of Worcester), Thomas Smith, (of Bath), Phillip West-  wood, Charles Phelps, Hiram Clark, John Banks, John Johnson. The three last   named were added, though the brethren had retired on committee.    The case then arose, before alluded to, in reference to the Worcestershire confer-  ence, which led to a variety of excellent teaching in reference to elders or others   interfering in the settlement of difficulties where they were not sent. The adjust-  ment of difficulties and the right of sitting in judgment belonging in an especial   manner to the high priesthood, unless elders received a special commission for that   purpose.    It was then carried that the church in Coventry continue under the control of the  Worcestershire conference.    The meeting being closed by prayer, adjourned until two p.m.    AFTERNOON SERVICE.    This service being opened as usual, elder Ward rose to make some remarks on   the responsibility of all connected with the kingdom of God. As individual mem-  bers of the church we were by no means exempt from this, inasmuch as it was every  man and woman's duty to warn their neighbour. And as we received any portion   of the authority of the holy priesthood, that responsibility increased, and he would  assure the meeting that the presidency in this land justly estimated the import-  ance of the position they occupied, and were well aware that they were answerable   to God for whatever measures they adopted in connexion with their superintendance   of this portion of his vineyard; and as they had no individual or party feelings, the   Saints might rest assured that all measures which they might seek to carry, would  be with a single eye to the glory of God.    Elder Hedlock then followed on the same principles.    The condition of the Macclesfield conference was then laid before the meeting,  when it was carried unanimously that elder William Walker (late of Hull) go la-  bour there, under the presidency of elder James Galley.    Elder Robert Crook having stated the necessity of some young active labourer 
 that I am a Latter Day Saint, say I   ought to give up my position and emigrate  at once. I try to show them why I should  not do so, but they only get angry.  As my children are growing up and  it is harmful for them being here, I have  written to say that if an organist is  wanted for the Tabernacle, that I should  be very pleased to apply for that position  The organ I play on (a pipe organ) is the  largest in Lincoln. It has 42 stops,  (only 16 less I believe than the Tabernacle  organ) three rows of keys, and 8  composition pedals, besides a pedal  key board.    I have been an organist for  21 years. I began when I was 15  and am now 36 years old.    I have great experience in  accompanying choirs, both great and small.  I can play all kinds of music. I  am confident I could manage the  Tabernacle organ and would do my  best to prove worthy of the position.  I know, and am proud of the   Tabernacle Choir and its Conductor   and

 I am confident I could play the  Organ satisfactorily and help to maintain  the high character of the music rendered  by the Choir. I am a good at reading & playing at ^eight.^  Amongst the returned Elders who  have visited at my house and have  heard me play are Elders Hodgeson,  Hardman, Jos: A. Buttle, H. J. Smith,  Westwood, Victor. P. Wells, and Tuckett of  Salt Lake City. Elder Reeves and wife of  Kaysville, Elder Clayton of Ogden, Elder Johnson  of Manti, Elder Johnso Jefferiyes of Tooele,  Elders Bellaston and Ord of Nephi, Elder  Seaman of Pleasant View, Elder Porter (Jn)  of Centreville, Elder Bullen (Jr.) of Richmond,  and Elder Geo. F. Wright.    The Elders whose names are under-  lined have heard me play the Organ.  Although I am a Schoolmaster by profession   I have always made music a secondary  profession and have often been advised  to take up music entirely. I am sorry  to say I hold no musical Certificate  having always gone in for Science Examinations  and Scholastic Examinations, but I can  get plenty of references as to my ability  as a musician.    I have met President A. H. Lund.  and

 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 173    being sent into the Derbyshire conference, it was carried that elder George Slater,  late of Nauvoo, take the presidency there, recommending him to avail himself, as   need might be, of the council of elder Crook.    Staffordshire conference being next considered, it was carried that elder Hiram  Clark take the presidency for the time being.    Garway conference wanting a president, by the retirement of elder Richard  Blakey, elder William Allen was unanimously voted to take the presidency thereof.    The condition of the Mars Hill conference being brought forward, it was carried   that elder E. F. Sheets (late of Bradford), preside over the same.    It was then carried by the meeting that elder Glaud Roger preside over the   Bradford conference, in the room of Brother Sheets.    It was next unanimously voted that elder John Allen take the presidency over   the Carlisle conference.    It was also voted, that elder Robert Martin preside over the Bedfordshire con-  ference, where he has been lately labouring.    It was then unanimously carried, that Hull be organized into a conference, and  that elder Henry Cuerden preside over the same.    It was then, with considerable good humour, unanimously voted that elder Dan   Jones, form, and preside over Wrexham conference, consisting at present only of   himself and wife. Some present wished to make elder Jones a present of some   branches in the neighbourhood to begin with, but the feeling of the meeting was   that he should build upon no other foundation than that which he had already got.   Elder Jones made some interesting remarks on his position, and of his anxiety to  preach the gospel to his countrymen in their native tongue, requesting an interest  in the faith and prayers of the Saints for his success,â€”when elder Ward arose, and  called upon the meeting, if they felt disposed to uphold brother Jones in his position,   to signify it by a hearty Amen! which was most heartily responded to.    It was then voted that elder G. P. Waugh labour under the direction of elder  John Banks, in the Edinburgh conference.    It was then voted that the branches of Louth, Taleby, and Wapload, be annexed  to the Hull conference, under the presidency of elder Henry Cuerden.    Voted also that Paul Harrison be ordained an elder, and go to labour in Ireland.    Voted that Doncaster be appended to the Sheffield conference.    Voted that Newhall branch be annexed to the Sheffield conference.    Voted that Kidderminster be annexed to the Worcestershire conference.    It was then unanimously carried that elder James Houston's appointment to la-  bour in Lanark receive the sanction of the conference.    The meeting which continued to a late hour, without interruption, then ad-  journed unto Tuesday morning.    TUESDAY.    The meeting being opened by singing and prayer.    Elder Webb was then called upon by the president to state the conditions of the  branches in his field of labour, viz., Chalford Hill, Avening, Tetbury, Kingswood,  Cam, and Nimphsfield.    It was then carried unanimously, that the before-mentioned branches be organ-  ized into a conference, and that elder E. H. Webb preside over the same.    It was then voted that Bath be organized into a conference, to be called the  Somersetshire conference.    It was then voted that elder George Robins go to labour in the Hull conference,   under the presidency of elder Henry Cuerden.    Elder John Johnson, president of the Cheltenham conference, being absent on  the committee, elder Phelps was called upon to lay the circumstances of the con-  ference before the meeting, in relation to a lawsuit now pending. It appeared  that the Saints had been subject to interruption in their meetings of the most outra-  geous and disgraceful character, notwithstanding they met in a place regularly   certified; that being obliged to have recourse to law in their own defence, they had  been, and expected to be still more, involved in expenses, which without assistance   they were not able to meet. Elder Woodruff remarked, that circumstances like

 174 GENERAL CONFERENCE.    those in the Cheltenham conference might be the lot of any other, and that it be-  hoved us to sympathise with our brethren, and render them what assistance we   could.    It was then unanimously resolved, that the presidents of conferences lay the case   before the churches, and that the Saints be exhorted to render what assistance  they can, forwarding the same to Liverpool as early as possible, to be remitted  to elder Johnson.    Elder Ward made some remarks on conformity to the laws of the land, exhort-  ing the brethren never to resort to physical force when oppressed by their enemies,   inasmuch as there was abundant protection in the laws, when justly administered.   He requested the brethren, that when they had acted according to principles   of righteousness, and the laws of the land, in all things, and yet could not get  protection or redress from the magistrates, that they would send him the addresses   of such persons, and he would adopt measures to teach them their duty. He had  been under the necessity of writing to two magistrates, and it behoved all the ser-  vants of the Lord to become, as much as possible, acquainted with the laws of the   land.    The Committee of the Joint Stock Company then making their entrance, it was   carried unanimously that the articles which had been drawn up by the Committee   be read before the meeting, consecutively, and afterwards item by item, to be dis-  cussed by the conference.    After the reading of the articles,    Elder Ward rose, in the first place, to move a vote of thanks to the brethren of   the committee for their very arduous labour, in the production of the articles  which had now been read, and which had occupied the committee some sixteen  hours. This vote was most heartily and unanimously carried.    Elder Thomas Wilson, president of the committee, then returned thanks,    Elder Hedlock rose to express his gratification at the result of the committee, so  far, and as he had been the first to suggest the plan, he felt much to rejoice at the   prospect of its ultimate success.    It was then voted that Brother Brown read the articles one by one for the consi-  deration of the conference.    AFTERNOON SERVICE.    The service being opened as usual, the following articles were for the time being   agreed upon. We shall not here present the remarks made upon each as it passed,  but merely quote each article as it was decided upon.    1. That this Joint Stock Company be called "The Mutual Benefit Association."    2. That it shall have for its objects the establishing of those branches of manu-  facture in America, which will be most beneficial, and return to the stockholders  the greatest amount of profit, requiring at the same time the least amount of capital  in erecting and carrying on its operations.    3. That this association shall bring over food and provisions from America, that   the members may have abundance of those things both cheap and good, at a price  considerably beneath that at which such provisions are usually supplied, that thus a  saving far exceeding the weekly payment for one share shall be effected.    4. That its capital shall consist of not less than thirty thousand pounds, divided  into sixty thousand shares of ten shillings each: that a deposit of one shilling per   share shall be paid within two months from the date hereof, or within one month   from the date of the application for shares at any future period; the remainder to   be paid in equal parts weekly or monthly, during the following eighteen months.    5. That each shareholder, shall have one vote, and one only, in all matters con-  nected with the business of the Mutual Benefit Association.    6. That a committee of fifteen directors shall be chosen to manage the affairs of   this association; that every male shareholder, aged twenty-five years, shall be eligi-  ble to become a director. That this committee have full power to manage the  affairs of this society. That they be appointed for twelve months; that four retire   annually by ballot, and other four be chosen in the same manner to fill up the  vacancy.
