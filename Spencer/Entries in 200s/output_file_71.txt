 REMARKSBy Elder Wilford Woodruff, Tabernacle, Dec. 21, 1856,Afternoon.-[REPORTED BY GEO. D. WATT.]-We have some few missionaries returned very recently, and I wish to notify them to meet with us on Tuesday evening in the Seven-ties' Council Hall; and we want all the Bishops in the city and the missionaries who have been appointed to labor here, to meet at the same place, on the same evening.I attended the High Priests' meeting last evening in the company with brs. F. D. Richards and Lorenzo Snow, and I want to say to allthe High Priests in this city, I want them to meet with their quorum; and we are going to meet with you; the Twelve will meet with you, and with the Seventies, and I want every man who is a president of Seventies to meet with his quorum at the time appointed. There was not more than half the High Priests out last evening.We are called upon to wake up and reform and it makes me feel curious when I go into and  the High Priests' meeting and see not one half of them there when a meeting is held to pre-pare them to wake up the people.I want this people to listen to what they have heard to-day. I feel thankful to see br. Kim-ball again come into this stand. I expressed my feelings when I saw the sacrament removed from the table; I felt that it was a loud sermon to this people; I said I knew not what would come next; I thought likely the Presidencywould be removed next from us; not that I ex-pected they would die; br. Grant, however, is gone; the load he undertook to draw killed himâ€”the same load that was pressing the Presi-dent of this church to the earth, when Jede-diah rose up to bear it off; his spirit was strong enough, but as br. Kimball said, his mortal body was not strong enough to bear its weight.  The First Presidency have not addressed this people but a little time since the sacrament was removed, therefore I was glad to see and hear br. Kimball to-day.Although Jedediah has been taken from us, that load, which in a measure has been removed from the Presidency of this church, has not re-turned onto them and I pray it never may. When Jedediah M. Grant went forth among the people through the north country and this city to carry out the views of President Young, and lifted up his voice like the trump of the angel of God, and called upon the people to awake out of their deep sleep and repent of their sins and turn unto God, the people were so sound asleep that they did not realize the importance of his mission; many felt that his labors and reproofs were unnecessary and un-called for; the people did not know what he was doing. Had the vision of their minds been open as was br. Grant's, and those who sent him, they would have seen and felt the impor-tance of that mission.I tell you the people have been asleep, and they are not yet half awake, they have not more than one eye open, and not that quite; when we hear such things as we have to-day, this people have got to wake up to righteous-ness. I have lived twenty-three years in the church, and I have been acquainted with Pro-phets and have heard them prophecy, and I have not yet seen their words fall to the ground unfulfilled; and when they speak Israel should hear and obey.We have been called upon, some of us, as missionaries to the people of this city, to wake them up. We shall be among you, brethren, and we do not intend to let you sleep. Br. Orson Hyde is with us to-day; he has had a dream which refers to the wheat and the thrashing floor. I am glad br. Hyde is with us, and I want to say to you, br. Hyde, in the name of the Lord, wake up and rise up in the midst of your brethren the Twelve, and lead them forth into the field of labor and we will stand by you; if you will lead the Twelve, br. Hyde, in the spirit and power of your calling as an Apostle of Jesus Christ, you will see your brethren by your side; we will back you up, and step forth and help to bear that mighty load which has rested upon the Presidency of the church like a mountain and nearly crushed them to the ground. As a quorum we have got to more fully obtain the spirit and power of our apostleship and take more upon ourselves the care and burthen of the church and king-dom of God than we have done.The Twelve Apostles have got to rise up and magnify their calling or they will be removed out of their place. The High Priests, the Seventies, the Bishops and every other quorum of the church and kingdom of God have got to do the same or they also will be removed; we cannot sleep any longer with the priesthood of Almighty God resting upon us, and the work that is required at our hands. WE CANNOT SLEEP. I do not wonder that calling on the people to wake up has killed one man, and it will kill more if we do not respond to the call; mortality cannot endure the visions of eternity that rests on them when they look on the priest-hood and see the position they are in; it has nearly laid br. Young in the grave; he felt he could not live until some man rose up and started the work of reformation.I know it is my duty to wake up and enter into the labors of my calling, and it is the duty of Elder Hyde, and the duty of every other man in Israel that bears this priesthood to do the same; it is our duty to bear off that burden and labor which has been resting like a mountain upon the leaders of this church. I know they have groaned under the load that has rested on them, when they have seen all Israel going to sleep.Let the Twelve Apostles, and the Seventy Apostles, and the High Priest Apostles, and all other Apostles rise up and keep pace with the work of the Lord God, for we have no time to sleep. What is a man's life good for, or his words or work good for when he stands in the way of men's salvation, exaltation andglory? They are of no use at all.As an individual I am determined to wake up and do my duty, God being my helper. I want to see br. Hyde, who is the president of the Twelve, walk into all these quorums and attend their meetings, and we will back him up; I want him to lift up his voice like a trumpet and go to winnowing the wheat; it is for the Twelve to rise up and carry off the load. The Seventies have got to walk up in their place and do their duty. I know God requires this at our hands. The law of God, the holy priest-hood, and the holy anointing and washing, and everything else that is holy requires it at our hands. I know this.It is necessary to reform. The question may be asked, what is the matter? Why, we are asleep; if the eyes of any man or woman is opened as they should be, they could see the things of God as they are in one moment; they would see there is a necessity of waking up and doing something. Here is a great and mighty dispensation committed into the hands of this people for the living and the dead; thecandle of the Lord God is placed in these mountains like a city that is set on a hill that cannot be hid; the work is on your shoulders, ye Priest of the Most High God!â€”on you rests the salvation of this generation, and the Lord will require this stewardship at your hands.The Lord has given you the keys of the priesthood with all the blessings pertaining to itâ€”as great and as mighty a work as ever was committed to any man on the earth, and that too in the midst of the last dispensation and fulness of times. The Lord requires us to prepare this generation, both Jew and Gentile, either for salvation or damnation through the proclamation of the gospel of Jesus Christ and the administering of the ordinances of the House of God, and we go to sleep!â€”the Apos-tles go to sleep!!â€”the Seventies go to sleep!!! the Elders of Israel close their eyes to slumber, and we the only people God has on the earth, upon whose shoulders he has laid the respon-sibility of performing this great and mighty work!Do you wonder that Prophets get up here and chastise, and draw the sword of justice and hold it over our heads? I do not. I won-der that our children at the fire side do not rise up and prophecy, with a voice like thunder and in flames of fire, unto their fathers and mothers, and unto the people of Israel. I know that the counsels we have had here through the mouth of the Prophets of God are just and true. I know that the warning voice that has been heard in this Stand, and the call that has been made on this floor is necessary; and I do hope and pray God that we, as missionaries, will listen to it. I want my brother mission-aries in the first place to wake up, and get aroused with the mantle of salvation and Spirit of God ourselves, and get our own armor bright. It has been justly remarked here that we have got to labor ourselves until we get the Spirit of God, and then we can walk out among the people and correct them; but if we as Sev-enties, as High Priests, and Apostles, and Elders bearing the priesthood, if we are re-solved to set our hearts upon things of this earth,without being engaged in the interest of the kingdom of God, what can we expect of the people? Not anything. I desire that we may all wake up, and listen to the counsel of these men who lead us from day to day.We have no time to lose to prepare ourselves for the things that are coming on the earth; and who wants to lose his crown, his glory, and hope of eternal lives that he has had in days past and gone by receiving the gospel of Jesus Christ? No man that has any portion of the Spirit of God. Let us rise up and mag-nify our calling, and labor before God until we can get the Holy Spirit, and until our prayers rend the vail of eternity and enter into the ears of the God of Sabbaoth and be answered in blessings upon our heads.When shall the fire be kindled in Zion?  I do not mean wild fireâ€”there is a true fire, and that is the fire we need to get, that is neces-sary to kindle; and if we live up to our privi-leges, do our duty, walk up to the word of the Lord God and magnify our calling we do know that the blessings of God will attend us, and the sinners in Zion will tremble and fearful-ness will surprise the hypocrite; and let what will come, all will be right with the Latter Day Saints.There are great things awaiting us and the worldâ€”the Lord is withdrawing his Spirit from the nations of the earth, his sword is bathed in heaven and will fall upon Idumea or the world; the seals are about to be opened and the judgments of God poured out upon the wicked, the cup of their wickedness and abominations is filled to the brim and the in-dignation of the Lord will be poured out with-out measure.Let the Saints read the revelations of God and they will see that there are important events at our doors. Let us hearken and wake up, and be doing the things required of us.  Let the missionaries first get their lamps trim-med and burning, and then go among the peo-ple, and go with the Spirit of God and the sal-vation of the gospel of Jesus Christ; and let the other quorums do the same; and when you do this you will see a reform, and sin and ini-quity cannot abide in our habitations, in our wards, or in our city.We have sin and sinners among us, and what are we going to do about it? Why, we are going to try to live our religion, and when we do that we shall do right. The business with me is to do right to-day, to live my religion to-day and leave the events with God; he holds the destinies of the nations and of all men; they are in his hand; he made the earth and controls the children of men upon it.Then let events roll onâ€”if we are only right, all is well. We have got to be tried even unto death. The Lord says he will prove us, and see if we abide in his covenants. There is where we have got to stand as a people, not only our horses, and gold and silver, and land and houses, but our lives have got to lie on the altar, and when anything comes to test us, even at the stake of our lives, we should be in the possession of the Holy Ghost not to flee fromit, and such will be crowned with the gift of eternal lives, exaltation and glory.There is nothing to encourage a man to draw back; there is nothing short of the most dam-nable principle that dwells in the spirit of devils that would tempt any man to shed the blood of the Lord's anointed, yet men will try to do it.  There are men here to-day who will possess that spirit; I believe it; they are in our city.  If they shed blood they have got the bill to pay.  Let the wicked and the ungodly, who will not repent, but fight against God, do their worst, their time is short, and the day will come, and that soon, when they will be called to judgment.I remember what Joseph said, a short time before he was slain in one of the last sermons I ever heard him preach. Says he, 'Men are here to-day who are seeking my blood, and they are those who have held the priesthood and have received their washings and anointings; men who have received their endowments.' I saw the faces of those men at that time and they had a hand in slaying the Prophet. There are men who possess the same spirit and the same desire. There are men here, too, that have faith, that have the priesthood and the spirit of it, and they will do their duty, and God will sustain them in it, and he will sustain this church and kingdom; let the trials of the Saints be what they will, the kingdom of God is not to be torn down any more at allâ€”it will not again be taken from the earth until it is prepared to receive Christ at his coming.Let us prepare ourselves and do our duty, and let the High Priests and Seventies go to their meetings, and before you go there, go to work and get the Spirit of God, that when you get there you may not freeze to death. And I want to have the people, when they come here, to get enough of the Spirit of God that when the Presidency rise in this Stand they may give us what is in their hearts. They are filled with blessings for this people. All the trouble is our eyes have been closed, we have been in adeep sleep; let us wake up and attend to our duty, and make it the first business we do.Those who lay their plans in secret cham-bers to seek the blood of the Prophets will have their case attended to by messengers on the other side of the vail, ministers will be sent to them who will render unto them a right-eous judgment there. I do not want to preach to them here, but to those who want to be saved.Go to and if you have not the Spirit of God, make it your first business to get it, that your minds may be opened to see the things of God as they are; it is your privilege and mine; that we may be prepared for what is to come.That this people may repent of all their sins and wake up, and have power to come before God that their prayers may be heard, be pre-pared to defend the kingdom and never desert their covenants and their brethren, or betray the gospel, but overcome the world, and be pre-pared to become joint heirs with Christ to the fulness of the first resurrection which is pre-pared for those who keep the commandments of God, is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ: Amen. 
 arose; I feel better now, and as thoughI had been refreshed in spirit. I thankGod I am able to talk to you, as the say-ing is, in my old age. The Lord hasbeen very merciful to me. The devilhas sought to kill me from the day Iwas born; but God has had an agentwith me to keep me from his power, andso far I have been preserved. I hopethe Lord will not let me live an hourlonger than I can live in his service. ButI am a feeble manâ€”weak like the restof you. If anybody supposes that thePresidency and Apostles here are nevertempted of the devil, they are mistaken.We are tempted all the time, more orless, and we have to war against thesethings in order to stand and maintainour position. I pray God that Hisblessings may rest upon us. I rejoicein this conference. It has been a glor-ious time. There is a good spirit here;and the testimonies that have beengiven unto us by the power of God havebeen choice. The angels are watchingover us. The eyes of all the heavenlyhosts are over us. Those who havelived in other dispensations understandthis dispensation far better than we do,and they are watching over the laborsof the Elders of Israel. I pray that wemay pursue that course wherein we maybe justified before God, and have powerto conquer and overcome; and when wehave finished here, that we can go hometo receive our reward. The great libraryin the celestial kingdom of our God con-tains the history of the dealings of Godwith all the world, for it belongs to thisworld. Your history is there; mine isthere; our testimonies are there; and wewill have to meet them. I hope andpray that my sins may be blotted out ofthe book of remembrance and not beremembered against me. I hope andpray this will be the case with you; forblessed is the man that will meet thisblessing when he comes to the end!God bless you. Amen. 
 DISCOURSEDelivered by President Wilford Wood-ruff, at Logan (Cache Stake Con-ference), Sunday Morning, Aug.3rd, 1890.I have a few thoughts and reflec-tions which I would like to present to the Latter-day Saints who com-pose this conference; but in order todo it, I need the help and assistance of the Spirit of God, as does everyman who attempts to teach thepeople.The subject that I have upon mymind is, union among the Latter-day Saints. The Savior said to His Apostles anciently, and to the Apostles in our day: "I say unto you, be one; and if ye are not oneye are not mine." [##Doctrine and Covenants 38:27##] "I and my Father are one." [##John 10:30##] There is a prin-ciple connected with this that I think is very important to us as a people and as a Church here onthe earth. With all the divisions,and all the discontent, and thequarrelings and opposition among the powers on earth, or that have been revealed from heaven, I havenever heard that it has everbeen revealed to the children of menthat there was any division betweenGod the Father, God the Son andGod the Holy Ghost. They are one. They always have been one. They always will be one, from eternity unto eternity. Our Heavenly Fatherstands at the head, being the Authorof the salvation of the children of men, and having created and peopled the world and given laws to the inhabitants of the earth. This principle is shown unto us by the revelation of the laws which belongto the different kingdoms. There isa celestial kingdom, a terrestrial kingdom, and a telestial kingdom.There is a glory of the sun, a glory of the moon, and a glory of the stars; and as one star differs from anotherstar in glory, so also is the resurrec-tion of the dead. In the celestial Kingdom of God there is oneness,there is union.In reading the history of the dealings of God with men, from the Bible, the Book of Mormon, and theDoctrine and Covenants, we cansee that, from the days of Father Adam, the Lord has raised up aclass of men, in every dispensation, upon whom He has bestowed HisPriesthood, and unto whom He hasgiven power and authority to do Hiswork upon the face of the earth among the children of men.  And these men have been in possession of principles of union with God, with the Son of God and with theHoly Ghost. The Holy Ghost wasgiven to Father Adam; he was filledwith it when, in his last days, heblessed those of his sons who were High Priests and the residue of hisposterity. [##Doctrine and Covenants 107:53##] Father Adam, Enoch,Moses, Noah, Abraham, Isaac andJacob, and all those old patriarchs and prophets were obliged to have communion with God. They wereunder the necessity of seeking unto the Lord, for unless they had thiscommunion they were notqualified to do their duty. They were dependent uponthe Lord for revelation, for light,and for instruction to have power to carry out the commandments of God. This union that the Lord re-quired of the ancient patriarchs and prophets, and which Jesus requiredof His Apostles, was required of Joseph Smith and his brethren. It has been required of all Saints of God from the foundation of the world till today.  Men who have held any portion of the Holy Priest-hood, and have had its gifts, graces, and blessings bestowed upon them, have been under the necessity of having communion with God. In the whole history of the world I have never read of any man whomGod has called to stand as the head of His work, who has not sought theLord while in that position; and theLord has been with him. It is my faith that the Lord will never per-mit any man upon whose shouldersHe places the authority and powerto lead Israel, to go astray, or to lead the children of God from thepath of duty. The Lord would re-move such a man from his place.In every age of the world theSaints of God have been obliged to be united. Babylon may divide;the inhabitants of the earth may have all the division they wish for; but they will receive the results of that disunion, and have done all the way through. City after city, nation after nation has been de-stroyed by the judgments of the Al-mighty whenever it has become ripened in iniquity, as in thecase of Sodom and Gomorrah, of Babylon, Nineveh, Tyre and Si-don, and a great many other ancient cities and countries. But the Saintsof God cannot prosper unless they are united. This has been demon-strated in the history of the world.  Moses, in his day, was obliged tohave communion and fellowship with God. The Lord gave untohim commandments, upon tables of stone, for the guidance of the children of Israel. When Mosescame down from the mountain andsaw the rebellion, the dissensionand the abominations of the Is-raelitesâ€”that, notwithstanding allthe miracles they had witnessed, revelations they had been given, they had made a golden calf toworship, because he had come back to them in timeâ€”he was soangry at their wickedness that hecast the tables of stone to the ground and broke them. [##Exodus 32##] Ofcourse you all know about this. But Moses had to have union with God. So in the whole history of the people of God in all ages. They have had to beunited. They have had to work to-gether. They have had to receivethe law of God together. Jesus

 Third Day, April 6th.PRESIDENT WOODRUFFwas the first speaker. His remarkswere as follows:I want to say to my brethren and sis-ters and friends that through your prayers and faith I am here this morn-ing. I have been considerably underthe weather, as the saying is, for a littletime past, but I am glad to meet withyou and feel to say a few words to youthis morning. I know it would not bewisdom for me to attempt to occupy agreat deal of time or say a great deal.First, I will say that I have fol-lowed the reports and sayings [of] theApostles and Elders from the commence-ment of this Conference until thismorning; what I have not read my-self has been read to me, and it hasbeen a great deal of consolation to me.I want to say to the Latter-day Saints,the God of heaven is at work carryingout His purposes in fulfilment of reve-lation and prophecy and inspiration, which He has given through His Prophets and Apostles and Patriarchs from the creation of the world until this hour. And the Lord is not goingto fail on His part in any of these things. It is for us as a people to doour duty, to labor for ourselves and forour fellowmen; to occupy the timethat we have here, to the best advan-tage we can, in trying to honor the Priesthood and people, to build up thekingdom of God, to set a good exam-ple, and to establish righteousness.And I want to say to the young menand maidens, my young brethren and sisters, who may be present here thismorning, I want you to make your aim high and realize that you haveyour generation, that you have yourtimes granted in connection withyour fathers and mothers in the building up of the kingdom of God. Do not spend your time in the follies and frivolities of thisworld, but try to improve your time.You occupy one of the most important dispensations and generations God has ever given to men, and I have a greatinterest for the rising generation. I know for myself, and not for another,that the Lord has raised up our chil-dren, our sons and our daughters, tostand in the footsteps of their fathers in the winding-up scene of the greatwork of the Zion of our God. I real-ize that they do not comprehend, in

 REMARKSMade by President Wilford Woodruff, At Paris, Idaho (Bear Lake StakeConference) on Monday Afternoon, August 10, 1891.[REPORTED BY ARTHUR WINTER.]I am very pleased indeed to meet with so many Latter-day Saints in thistabernacle on a working day, and I hope you will get paid for coming tomeeting today. I have felt amplypaid myself for my journey from Salt Lake City in listening to the instruc-tions which our brethren have given unto us. I told Brother Cannon this morning that if, when a young man, I could have attended a meeting of this kind and heard instructions as we have had given to us, I should have felt that I was in heaven; I should have been satisfied that I had received what I had prayed for and de-sired from my childhood. When I wasa boy I read in the New Testament concerning Jesus Christ and His Gos-pel, and the gifts and graces that were then manifested, and I felt that theprinciples there taught were the ones that I desired to live to hear taught. Iprayed for this earnestly in my early manhood. I have read the Biblethrough a good many times in my life. I have read the Book of Mormon through a number of times.  I have also read the Book of Doctrine and Covenants through a number of times; and I have felt that God had never givenunto us stronger principles and more glorious instructions in any of therevelations of God than are recorded in the Book of Doctrine and Covenants.  They are all by the same author, but to different men, and at different times.  I will read a few verses from the121st section of the Doctrine and Covenants.This section contains the prayer andprophecy of the Prophet Joseph whilehe was in Liberty jail; and the truthsembodied therein are among the sub-limest that God has ever revealed to man:For there is a time appointed for everyman, according as his works shall be.God shall give unto you (the Saints) knowledge by His Holy Spirit, yea by the unspeakable gift of the Holy Ghost,that has not been revealed since the world was until now;Which our forefathers have waitedwith anxious expectation to be revealed in the last times, which their minds wereappointed to, by the angels, as held in re-serve for the fullness of their glory:A time to come in the which nothing shall be withheld, whether there be one God or many Gods they shall be mani-fest;All thrones and dominions, princi-palities and powers, shall be revealedand set forth upon all who have endured valiantly for the Gospel of Jesus Christ;And also if there be bounds set to theheavens, or to the seas; or to the dry land, or to the sun, moon, or stars;All the times of their revolutions: all the appointed days, months, and years,and all the days of their days, months, and years, and their glories, laws, and set times, shall be revealed, in the days of the dispensation of the fulness of times,According to that which was ordained in the midst of the Council of the Eternal God of all other Gods, before this world was, that should be reserved unto the finishing and the end thereof, when every man shall enter into his eternalpresence, and into his mortal rest.How long can rolling waters remainimpure? What power shall stay theheavens? As well might man stretchforth his puny arm to stop the Missouri river in its decreed course, or to turn it up stream, as to hinder the Almightyfrom pouring down knowledge from heaven, upon the heads of the Latter-day Saints.Behold, there are may called, but few are chosen. And why are they not chosen?Because their hearts are set so much upon the things of this world, and aspire to the honors of men, that they do notlearn this one lessonâ€”That the rights of the Priesthood are inseparably connected with the powers of heaven, and that the powers of heavencannot be controlled nor handled only upon the principles of righteousness.That they may be conferred upon us, it is true; but when we undertake to cover our sins, or to gratify our pride, our vain ambition, or to exercise control, or do-minion, or compulsion, upon the souls ofthe children of men, in any degree of un-righteousness, behold, the heavens with-draw themselves; the Spirit of the Lord is grieved; and when it is withdrawn, Amen to the Priesthood, or the authority of that man.Behold! ere he is aware, he is left to himself, to kick against the pricks; to persecute the Saints, and to fight againstGod.We have learned, by sad experience, that it is the nature and disposition of al-most all men, as soon as they get a little authority, as they suppose, they will im-mediately begin to exercise unrighteous dominion.Hence many are called, but few are chosen.Who can comprehend this grand language?  Scarcely any person. The Lord says in this revelation that whether there be one God or many Gods, they shall be revealed; and all kingdoms, thrones, principalities and powers shall be revealed unto those who keep His commandments. Can we comprehend this? Why, there is not an astronomer that can tell us scarcely one thing that is done in Mars,or Venus, or Jupiter, or in any of the planets, aside from the earth. Hereare worlds upon worldsâ€”millions of themâ€”and what do we know about them? Our own little planet, upon which we live, is about as much as we can comprehend.  Look at the extent of the blessings that are promised us!  These blessings and these revelations are worthy the attention of the Latter-daySaints.In this revelation it is shown that the Priesthood of which we have beenspeaking, has power. It has power with the heavens; it has power on earth. And as was said this morning, it does not make any difference what portion of that Priesthood a man holdsâ€”whether it is a President, an Apostle, an High Priest, a Seventy, an Elder, a Priest, a Teacher or a Deaconâ€”when he goes before God in prayer, with a

 THE DESERET WEEKLY.A PRIESTHOOD MEETINGwas held in the evening, beginning at 7 o'clock. It was probably the largest gathering of the kind ever held since the organization of the Church in this dispensation. The speakers were, in the order in which they addressed the assemblage, Presidents George Q. Can-non, Joseph F. Smith and Wilford Woodruff. The themes dwelt upon 
 was one with the Father. Says He: "For I came down from heaven,not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me." [##John 6:38##] Thisunion was never broken between the Father and the Son. The first revelation given to Joseph Smith was that of the Father and the Son. The heavens were opened, and theFather, with His Son, appeared to Joseph, in answer to his prayer, and He pointed to His Son and said,"This is my beloved Son; hear yehim." [##Joseph Smith-History 1:17##] This is a peculiarity that I have no recollection of ever beingmanifest in any other age of theworld. Another peculiar featureconnected with this dispensation is that the God of heaven has bestow-ed upon almost all the male mem-bers of the Church the Holy Priest-hood.This union was necessary between God and the prophets and apostlesof old. Unless that union had ex-isted between Him and His serv-ants it could not have extended throughout the children of Israel or among the children of men. It is also of vast importance to us in this Church and kingdom. I will say myself that I do not believe there ever was a man, save Jesus Christ, that was more closely united and associated with God the Father, and God the Son, and God the HolyGhost, than the Prophet JosephSmith. The power of revelationwas with him from the day that hewas called to receive the Priesthoodup to the time when he was martyr-ed. The power of inspiration was with him day by day. This is plainly manifest in the revelationscontained in the Book of Doctrine and Covenants. Whenever the Lord felt disposed to reprove him,Joseph Smith, through his ownmouth, had to reprove himself; andhe did not hesitate to give the word of the Lord, though it was againsthimself. He was united with theLord; he was united with the HolyGhost; he was united with theangels in heaven, with Peter, Jamesand John and with John the Bap-tist. He received the Priesthood from under their hands. [##Doctrine and Covenants 128:20##] [##Joseph Smith-History 1:72##] Joseph called twelve Apostles. Who werethey? The Lord said to him: "The twelve are they who shall desire totake upon them my name withfull purpose of heart; and ifthey desire to take upon them my name with full purpose of heart, they are called to go into allthe world to preach my gospel untoevery creature." [##Doctrine and Covenants 18:27-28##] The history of these twelve Apostles we are some-what acquainted with. I have beenassociated with the Apostleship for over fifty years. I knew those men. I knew their lives. When theProphet Joseph organized the Quorum of the twelve Apostles, he taught this principle of union to them. He gave them to understand that they must be of one heart andone mind, and they must take upon themselves fully the name of Christ; that if God commanded them to do anything they must go and do it; that if they mar-ried a wife they could not stayat home three or four years to takecare of her if they were called to go to the nations of the earth.I myself started on a mission sixweeks after I was married, and I was gone two or three years. So with others of my brethren. It mattered not what temporal work we had to do, when we were called to go abroad we had to go. This was one of the requirements of the Apostleship. We also had to beunited. We could not contend one with another. If we did, the Spirit of God would be withdrawn fromus, and we would receive chastise-ment at the hands of the Lord. Under the celestial law of theKingdom of God men must unitetogether; men must love one another; men must stand by this Holy Priesthood and maintain thepowers of it while they dwell in theflesh, in order to honor God and tobe prepared to receive their inherit-ances in the world to come.As I have said before, I have beena member of the Quorum of theApostles for over fifty years. I bave [have]been acquainted with its ups and downs. I have been familiar withthe apostates. I have also been ac-quainted with the union that has existed. I can say that I never asso-ciated with a class of men that ever manifested the same love for one an-other as the Apostles of the Churchhave when they have been faith-ful. Of course, we have seen days of sorrow. After that first Quorum was called of God; after they had had the ministration of angels andseen the power of God manifested, some of them yielded to temptation. They said, "We have served God long enough, and now we are goingto serve ourselves."  They stopped praying and went to merchandising. They stopped serving God, and took a decided stand against the Prophetwhom God had raised up to lay the foundation of this Church andkingdom. What were the conse-quences? It sent them to perdi-tion. Their power fell like light-ning from heaven. Their priest-hood was taken from them, andsealed upon the heads of other men. It has remained so to this day, andwill, for all I know, to the endlessages of etenrity. With all the light they had, with all the powerthey had, and with all the manifestations they had fromGod out of heaven, they turned from these things and re-jected them. Those were days of sorrow to me and to those who re-mained faithful; for one half of the Quorum fell and turned against Joseph. But the Lord was with him. So was Brigham Young andHeber C. Kimball and others of thebrethren of the quorum. They stood by him; while others deserted him and were cut off the Church, and they to-day are in the Spirit world, without the Priesthood, withouttheir crown, without their glory, and without the celestial blessings that were promised them on con-dition of their faithfulness.With this exception, the Quorumof the twelve Apostles have been united. We knew this was the workof God. We knew the God of heaven had laid this Apostleship up-on our shoulders. We knew, asJoseph Smith told us just before hismartyrdom, that if we did not round up our shoulders and bear off thiskingdom we would be damned. Noman can receive this Apostleship; no man can bear this Priesthood; no man can be called to this important calling, and then turn from it, with-out condemnation or being cursed by the hand of God. It matters not what sacrifices God requires at our hands in the building up of His kingdom, we have got to meet thesethings and trust in Him.The Prophet Joseph, in his day, consulted with the Apostles and sought their views on important matters and principles. He would say, "I want you to tell me your views and feelings about this, thatand the other." The agency whichGod had given us was never taken from us, either by Him or His Prophet. We used to express our feelings to the Prophet, and we did so with all good conscience before God. As a general thing our viewswere alike; but if there was any-thing in them different from what Joseph considered was right, whenwe got through he would tell usthus and so. Then we did not standagainst that, but we united upon it. One of the Apostles once broughtbefore the Prophet Joseph a very pe-culiar kind of a system. Joseph listened to him very patiently, and when this brother got through hesays, "Brother Joseph, what doyou think of that?" "Why," says he, "Brother â€”â€”â€”, it is a beautifulsystem, and I have only one faultin the world to find about it." "What is it?" "It is not true."  Of course, when a man gets up a thing that is not true, he has to layit aside.I want to say, for the comfort of the Latter-day Saints, that God is not going to fail anybody. He hascarried out His purposes in everyage and generation of men. AsBrother Snow said today, He raisedup old father Abraham to stand atthe head of the House of Israel, be-cause he was a noble spirit. Beforehe was born he occupied such a position with God, in his agency,that he was given supremacy hereon the earth. He stands at thehead of his posterity, and at thehead of Israel, and willoccupy that position forever. The Lord is not going todisappoint us. He has fulfilled His work up to the present time; andnow comes the consummation, the winding up scene, and the fulfil-ment of all those prophecies and revelations which God has given to inspired men, who were moved upon by the Holy Ghost. Thoserevelations you and I are fulfilling.Joseph Smith laid the foundation ofthis work. He holds the key of theKingdom today, and will to the endless ages of eternity. He has passed and gone. Over twenty Apostles have passed away. Those who laid the foundation of this work are now in the Spirit world. But we are alive here, and have yet a few days in which to work.Today we have a Quorum of TwelveApostles. When men have died or apostatized, others have been called to fill their places. When the Prophet Joseph was taken away,President Young occupied his 
 PRIESTHOOD MEETING.A Priesthood meeting was held in the Tabernacle on the evening of Tues-day, April 5th. It was probably the largest gathering of the kind that hasever convened in the history of the Church in this dispensation. Thespeakers were, in the order in whichthey addressed the assembly: Presi-dent Joseph F. Smith, PresidentGeorge Q. Cannon and President Wilford Woodruff. Much valuabe in-struction was embodied in their re-marks.President Wilford Woodruffsaid in substance: If there is any scene on the face of this earth that will at-tract the attention of the God ofheaven and the heavenly host, it is theone before us today--the assembling of this people, the shout of "Hosanna," the laying of the top stone of this tem-ple in honor to our God. My brethren,sisters and friends, we want to finish this Temple; we want to dedicate it un-to God as soon as we can, so that the vasthost who dwell in this region of country may go into it and attend to the ordinances for their living and for their dead. I hope we shall all laythis to heart and try to furnish means so far as we can, in order that the building may be speedily completed. We are able, as a people, to do this. Irealize that there are many calls uponthe Latter-day Saints for the work andpurposes of the Church and kingdon ofGod upon the earth; but this work now before us is a most important event--the most important that we have upon our hands. I well remember the dayand the hour when this first revelation for the redemption of our dead was received by the mouthof the Prophet of God. Who can com-prehend this? Where is the man or woman who can comprehend this principle, that we have the power to go into these Temples of our God andredeem our progenitors--our fathersand our mothers, from whom we havedescended? They never heard the Gospel; they never enjoyed the bless-ings which you and I have in our day and time through the mercy ofGod. We are their posterity. Theyare on the other side of the vail, shutup in prison, and will remain there 
 6-9 Oct 1892, 62nd Semi-Annual General Conference, SLC Tabernacle.[Deseret News Weekly 45:513, 10/15/92, p 1; Millennial Star 54:689, 705, 721, 737, 769, 785, 801][7 Oct, 7 pm][DNW 45:517, 10/15/92, p 5]PRIESTHOOD MEETING.A meeting of the general Priesthoodwas held in the Tabernacle last night,April 7th, beginning at 7 o'clock. Thefirst speaker was President Joseph F. Smith. He gave much practical in-struction upon the subject of looking after the moral and religious welfare ofthe young, and seeing that they were not permitted to spend their time in idleness. He also spoke deprecatingly of the disregard paid by many to thecommandment of God in relation tothe observance of the Sabbath day. Theconcluding portion of his discourse was devoted to the evils growing out of going into debt without sufficient reason; the dangers of extravaganceand class distinctions on the basis of wealth. He also exhorted his hearersto contribute generously to the funds needed to complete the Temple in thiscity.President Woodruff followed by de-livering a discourse upon the magni-tude of the work of God and the re-sponsibilities resting upon those who held the Priesthood.President George Q. Cannon spokeupon the importance of those holding high office in the Church being care-ful as to how they used their author-ity, as they would be held to strict accountability by the Lord for themanner in which they exercised theircallings. None of the humblest of God's creatures could be wronged withimpunity. He spoke also on the neces-sity of being charitable and of the evilresults of backbiting; also upon the necessity of seeking to save our off-spring, who, according to the everlast-ing covenant, were the children of promise. We ought to have great hopes of them, even when they went astray, exercising faith that they might be reclaimed. 
 fact there are very few who compre-hend today the position we occupy,and the responsibility we are under toGod and the Holy Priesthood, who have raised us up and placed us here in the midst of a generation of menand women, children of men, upon whose heads are going to rest greatresponsibilities, in the great eventswhich are to follow each other inquick succession in the day in whichwe live.As far as I am concerned, I do notknow, it has never been revealed tome, why my life has been pre-served, while the Lord has taken away Prophets and Apostles and other men of God, who havespent three or four, ten or twelve, fourteen or fifteen years in the capa-city of the building up of the kingdomof God. Our Savior Himself was only three years and a half in passing through His experiences of teachingthe people, the organization of the kingdom of God, the choosing of theTwelve Apostles, His crucifixion, His death and His resurrection. TheProphet Joseph spent about fourteen years in translating the Book of Mor-mon, the history of the Jews, the House of Israel on this continent, andthe dealings of God with that people. He performed that work, and broughtforth the book of Doctrine and Cove-nants, a code of revelations as great inlanguage and principles, and theaccount of as great and important events as have ever occurred on the earth. He performed all this work inabout fourteen years and a half. Mybrethren, the Apostles, two or three quorums, have passed away since myordination; nearly all but myself up toa certain period, have passed. I am not speaking these things boastfully,but I am here, and it is my duty while I remain here, to try to say something that will be of interest to the Latter-day Saints. I am interested in your welfare, in the welfare of Zion. It is the Zion of God, planted here bythe hand of God, and the Lord has guided and directed it, and will con-tinue to do so.You have Apostles with you, you have High Priests, and Seventies, andthe other bodies of Priesthood, and they have a great responsibility restingupon them, in the capacity in whichthey labor. I have a great desire,what time I do live, to see the peopleprogress, to become united, to compre-hend and to understand the spirit and power of God and their calling; youshould do this, and you have got to dosomething of this kind, in order tocarry out the purposes of the Lord. You stand here in the mountains of Israel, raised up by the Lord. Youhave done a great work here, and there is a great deal more to do. You areredeeming the dead and the living,and sending abroad thousands of theElders to warn the nations of the earthof those events which are to come uponthem and upon us. Therefore, theElders should try to be faithful, and we should watch over our sonsand daughters, give them good advice, and set them a good example that we may have no regrets of their falling into principles and practices whichare not right and righteous before God, on account of our example.I say, God bless you; labor for the Holy Spirit, labor for light and truth,for revelation and inspiration, learnthe mind and will of God concerning yourselves and the truth of the workof God on the earth. Keep your eyes open to see, your ears to hear, and your hearts to understand the truth,and that you may see the hand of Godvisible throughout this land andthroughout this nation, and through-out the world, which will be moreand more visible from this time to thewinding-up scene. God bless you,amen.

 pure heart, that Priesthood has power with the heavens. If a man magnifies that Priesthood, the blessings of God are with him.The first sermon that I ever heard in this church was in 1833, by old father Zera Pulsipher, who died in the south, after having lived to be considerably over eighty years old. That sermon was what I had prayed for from my childhood. When I heard it I had a testimony for myself that it was true. I received it with every sentiment of my heart. He preached in a school house upon a farm that we owned in Oswego County, New York. He opened the door for any remarks to be made. The house was crowded. The first thing I knew I stood on top of a bench before the people, not knowing what I got up for. But I said to my neighbors and friends, "I want you to be careful what you say as touching these men (there were two of them) and their testimony, for they are servants of God and they have testified unto us the truthâ€”principles that I have been looking for from my child-hood." I went forth and was baptized. I was ordained a Teacher. I was al-ways sorry that I was not a Deacon first; for I had a desire to bear the Priesthood in its various degrees, as far as I was worthy. I had had a desire for years, not only to hear the Gospel, but to have the privilege and power of preaching it to my fellow men. I was a miller by trade, and I spent many a midnight hour in the mill calling upon the Lord for light and truth, and pray-ing that I might hear the Gospel of Christ and be able to teach it to my fellow men. I rejoiced in it when I did receive it. I afterwards went with Zion's Camp to Missouri in the spring of 1834, with the Prophet Joseph, his brother Hyrum, and over two hund-red of the Saints of God. That was a great mission to me. I was with the Prophet. I had read his revelations. I had read the vision recorded in this Book of Doctrine and Covenants, and it had given me more light and more knowledge with regard to the dealings of God with men than all the revela-tions I had ever read, in the Bible or anywhere else. I had been taught that there was one heaven and one hell; and everybody that was notsprinkled or baptized, infants and all, would have to go to hell. It made nodifference whether the individual had committed no wrong, if he had not been received into the church by sprinkling or baptism, he would have to go to hell with the murderer, with the whoremonger, with the wickedest of men. On the other hand, every-body that was sprinkled would go to heaven. No matter if they had never made a single sacrifice for the Gospel of Christ, they would have the same glory as Peter, James and John, who had sacrificed their lives for the Gospel's sake. That was the kind of teaching I heard in my boyhood. I did not believe one word of it then; and I don't now. But this vision ofwhich I speak opened my eyes. It showed me the power of God and therighteousness of God in dealing with the human family. Before I saw Joseph I said I did not care how old he was, or how young he was, I did not care how he lookedâ€”whether his hair was long or short; the man that advanced that revelation was a prophet of God. I knew it for myself. I first met Joseph Smith in the streets of Kirtland. He had on an old hat, and a pistol in his hand. Said he, "Brother Woodruff, I've been out shooting at a mark, and I wanted to see if I could hit anything;" and says he, "Have you any objection to it?"  "Not at all," says I; "there is no law against a man shoot-ing at a mark, that I know of." He invited me to his house. He had a wolf skin, which he wanted me to help him to tan; he wan-ted it to sit on while driving his wagon team. Now, many might have said, "You are a pretty prophet; shooting apistol and tanning a wolf skin." Well we tanned it, and used it while mak-ing a journey of a thousand miles. This was my first acquaintance with the Prophet Joseph. And from that day until the present, with all the apostasies that we have had, and with all the difficulties and afflictions we have have been called to pass through, I never saw a moment when I had any doubt with regard to this work. I have had no trial about this. While the people were apostatizing on the right hand and the left, and while Apostles were urging me to turn against the Prophet Joseph, it was no temptation to me to doubt this work or to doubt that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God.As I have said, while holding the office of teacher, I went to Missouri in Zion's Camp. After arriving in Mis-souri, having gone through many trials and tribulations, and suffering from cholera, which caused us to lay in the grave fifteen of our brethren, we stayed at brother Lyman Wight's.  While at Lyman Wight's, I attended council meetings with the Prophet, with David Whitmer, with Oliver Cowdery and other leading brethren of the Church. David Whitmer was the President of the Stake of Zion. Brother Joseph reproved him very sharply, as well as some of the other brethren, because of their lack in ful-filling the commandments of God and doing their duty. While at that place I had a great desire in my heart to go and preach the gospel. I went off one Sunday night by myself into a hickory grove, several hundred yardsfrom the settlement, and I asked the Lord to open the door for me that I might go and preach the gospel. I did not want to preach the Gospel for any honor I might get on this earth; for I thoroughly understood as far as a man could in my condition, what a preacher would have to pass through. It was not honor, nor wealth, nor gold, nor silver that I desired; but I knew this was the gospel of Christ, revealed to me by the power of God; I knew this was the Church of Christ; I knew Joseph Smith was a prophet of God; and I had a desire that I might preach that gospel to the nations of the earth. I asked the Lord to give me that privilege. The Lord answered that prayer and said I should have my desire granted. I got up rejoicing. I walked about two hundred yards out in the open road, and when I got into the road, there stood Judge Higbee. Says he, "Brother Woodruff, the Lord has revealed to me that it is your duty to be ordained to go and preach the gospel." Says I, "Has He?" "Yes." "Well,"says I, "if the Lord wants me to preachthe gospel, I am perfectly willing to goand do that." I did not tell him I had been praying for this. The conse-quence was, I attended a council atLyman Wight's, and was called andordained to the office of a Priest in theAaronic Priesthood, while other breth-ren were ordained Elders. I wascalled by Bishop Partridge to go to theSouthern country on a mission. Bishop Partridge asked me a great manyquestions, and I asked him questions.  It was then dangerous for any of ourbrethren to go through Jackson Coun-ty. He wanted me to go to Arkansas,and the road led square through Jack-son County. I asked him if we should gothrough there (I had a companion with me--an Elder).  Says he, "If youhave got faith to do it, you may; Ihaven't." I thought that was a curiousremark from a Bishop. "Well," saysI, "the Lord says we must travel with-out purse or script; shall we do it?"Says he, "That is the law of God; ifyou have got faith to do it, you can do it." He said he had hardly got faithto go into Jackson County.  However,we started and went through Jack-son County. We came near los-ing our lives, and were saved almost bya miracle. We traveled through Ark-ansas and other parts.But I do not want to dwell on these things. I merely wish to say that Iwent out as a Priest, and my compan-ion as an Elder, and we traveled thou-sands of miles and had many thingsmanifested to us. I desire to impressupon you the fact that it does not makeany difference whether a man is aPriest or an Apostle, if he magnifies hiscalling. A Priest holds the keys ofthe ministering of angels. Never in my life, as an Apostle, as a Seventy,or as an Elder, have I ever had moreof the protection of the Lord than while holding the office of a Priest.The Lord revealed to me, by visions, by revelations, and by the Holy Spirit,many things that lay before me.I was once moved upon to go andwarn old Father Hakeman, living onPetty-John Creek, Arkansas.  He hadbeen in Jackson County during thepersecution period. His wife died there.His family consisted of five sons, all over six feet tall. Most of them hadbeen whipped with hickory gads bymobe, and he went south into Arkan-sas, taking his sons with him. Wewent a good deal out of our way forthe purpose of visiting Father Hake-man. I had a vision the night pre-vious, in which was manifested to methe trouble that lay before us, but thatthe Lord would deliver us. We arrived athis house on Sunday morning. He wastaking breakfast. We had had break-fast at the place where we stayed overnight. I saw a Book of Mormon on hisshelf. He did not seem to pay anyattention to us or to take any inter-est in us. I took up the Book of Mormon, and said, "You have avery good book here." "Yes," said he,"but it is a book that came from thedevil." That opened my eyes. Hehad been an Elder; he had been in Zion; he had been persecuted there anddriven out; but I found that he hadapostatized, and he was our enemy.I saw he would do anything he couldagainst us. We left him and went toBrother Hubbard's and stayed withhim three weeks, during which we

Businesscares will not stand as an excuse fornot responding to the calls of duty inconnection with the calling of thePriesthood. We are living in a time when the love of the world prevails,and great care has to be taken lest thecallings of the Priesthood be lost sightof by this feeling. Greater care shouldbe taken in providing employment forthe people, and means should beadopted for that purpose. It would probably be a good thing to have mis-sionaries called to devote their time tolaboring among the people in Zion, visiting them at their homes and look-ing after their spiritual and temporal welfare. Those who hold the Priest-hood should refrain from all conductthat is improper, and should exercisean influence for peace, acting in allkindness and brotherly love. It is notin keeping with the genius of the Gos-pel to indulge in anger, which leads towrong and sometimes breaks up friend-ships that have existed for years. The brethren should govern their families in love, avoiding all forms of harshness.The instructions and ideas presentedwere clear and pointed, and a goodspirit was present in the meeting.

Sher-wood, and singing.The forenoon was occupied by Presi-dent Young preaching a funeral sermonon the occasion of the death of brotherLewis Abbott, was followed in his re-marks by Elder H. G. Sherwood, LeviGifford, John Young, and H. C. Kim-ball, and benediction by Elder Hyde.2 O'CLOCK, P. M.Conference being called to order, and opened in the usual manner. The Patri-arch John Smith, said he had been through the whole scene of persecution,of mobbing, and murders, from 1832 tothe present time; and alluded to the nightof the murder of Joseph and Hyrum inCarthage Jail, and called on the people topay their tithing, that it may be said ofus, well done good and faithful servants;and was followed in similar remarks byPresident Kimball, Edward Hunter, W. W. Phelps, Isaac Chase, and Zera Pulsi-pher.The Patriarch again arose to speak onthe Word of Wisdom, and urging on thebrethren to leave off using tobacco, &c.President Young rose to put the mo-tion and called on all the sisters who willleave off the use of tea, coffee, &c., tomanifest it by raising the right hand;seconded and carried.And then put the following motion;calling on all the boys who were underninety years of age who would covenantto leave off the use of tobacco, whisky,and all things mentioned in the Word of Wisdom, to manifest it in the same man-ner, which was carried unanimously.The Patriarch then said, may the Lordbless you and help you to keep all yourcovenants.  Amen.President Young amongst other thingssaid he knew the goodness of the people,and the Lord bears with our weakness;we must serve the Lord, and those whogo with me will keep the Word of Wis-dom, and if the High Priests, the Seven-ties, the Elders, and others will not serve the Lord, we will sever them from theChurch. I will draw the line and knowwho is for the Lord and who is not, andthose who will not keep the Word of Wisdom, I will cut off from the Church;I throw out a challenge to all men and women. Have I not always counselled you right? I would rather you would cut me into inch pieces, than to flinchfrom my duty, the Lord being my helper. I would rather live with a few men whowill serve the Lord, than live with tenthousand hypocrites. He then exhortedthe men and women never to quarrel, to cease all contentions. If a man abusesyou, settle with him with kind words, butnever go to law. Let every head of a family father their family together nightand morning, and wait on the Lord untilhis Spirit rests on you like a cloud, and I say unto you in the name of the LordGod of Israel, be you blest.Adjourned until Wednesday, at teno'clock, A. M.Benediction by George A. Smith.Wednesday, Sept. 10th, 10 o'clock, A. M.Conference called to order, and was opened with singing by the Choir.Prayer by President Young, and sing-ing.E. D. Wooley bore testimony of the work of the Lord, that Joseph was a Pro-phet of God, and that Brigham is just as good a man as Joseph was, and he was as good a man as ever lived on the earth,&c.President Young spoke on the subject of the Mormon Battalion, and why they 
 place. He held the keys of the Kingdom of God. It was for himto have association with God the Father and with His Son JesusChrist, and to lead Israel. Youknow what he has done. It is be-fore you. He has filled these moun-tains of Israel with cities and towns and villages. He performeda great work. God was with him. He was true and faithful. He was one of the first Quorum of Apos-tles. He never varied; he never shrank from duty. He stood by theProphet Joseph while he lived. Hestood by the Kingdom of God andby the Lord as long as he lived himself. After his death, Brother Taylor took his place; and when he passed away it fell uponme, for a little while. It is my duty to have fellowship with God, asweak an instrument as I am in thehands of God. It is my duty tohave power with God. And when I have this, then my counsel-ors should stand by me and withme. We should be of one heart and mind in all matters, temporal andspiritual, that come before us in thelabor of the Church and Kingdom ofGod. And I am thankful to say that this has been the case since I have been called to this position, or since the organization of the Presi-dency of the Church. Standing con-nected with us here are the TwelveApostles. It is their duty to be ofone heart and one mind. They have no right to be otherwise. Theycannot be otherwise and prosper be-fore God. They should be one with us, and we one with them. Theyhave their rights; they have their agency. But when the Presidencyof the Church say unto any of them, "This is the word of the Lord," or, "This is right," they should takehold and work with us. The law ofGod requires this union at ourhands. It is the duty of the Seven-ties, also, to be united with the Twelve Apostles. The Seventies are called upon by the Apostles togo forth and labor in the vineyard of the Lord, and they work together.  So, brethren and sisters, with every organization in this Church. There should be union. There should be no discord, no dis-union. If there is, the Lord is not pleased with it, and we arehindered in our work. I want allthe Quorums to understand this. The lesser Priesthood should be unit-ed. Here is Bishop Preston. He stands at the head of the AaronicPriesthood. He has got counselors.  They should be united together.  They should be united with the less-er Priesthood, and they should la-bor to promote their inter-est and welfare. I have no fault tofind with the brethren in these matters. I mention these things as duties devolving upon us.Now, brethren and sisters, we should all be united. Unless we are one, we are not the Lord's. I wishto exhort the Latter-day Saints toobserve this principle. Our aim ishigh. What is that aim? It is theCelestial Kingdom of ourGod. Wehave been called out of the world, from almost all nations under heav-en, in fulfilment of the revelations of God. We have been calledunto these mountains of Israel. We are fulfilling revelations that weregiven thousands of years ago. The eyes of Jeremiah, of Ezekiel, of Daniel, of Isaiah and of the ancient Patriarchs and Prophets beheld ourday. They saw our Zion. Theysaw our temples and our tabernacle, built "for a shadow in the daytimefrom the heat, and for a place of ref-uge, and for a covert from storm and from rain." [##Isaiah 4:6##]Brethren and sisters, let us look at these things as they are. What isthis world? Our lives here are tem-porary; they are of short duration.We are here upon a mission. This people have been called togetherfrom almost every nation underheaven. They have gathered hereâ€”a little handful out of fourteen hun-dred millions of the human family.  Do you suppose the eyes of theLord have been withdrawn from this people? Have the eyes of the heavenly host been withdrawn? No;they are watching over us with feelings of the deepest interest.  They know where we stand. Why do we have this warfare that we arepassing through? Because it is theChurch and Kingdom of God; be-cause we are the people of God. No man can live godly in ChristJesus without suffering persecution.  This is your legacy. It is the legacy of all the Saints of God in everyage of the world. Therefore, I say to the Latter-day Saints, let your hearts be comforted. All is right inIsrael, as far as we make it right,and as far as we do our duty.I listened yesterday to the reportsmade by the Bishops and others.  No doubt there is room for improve-ment in Logan. There is room for a great deal of improvement in SaltLake City. There is room for im-provement throughout these moun-tains. These Elders of Israel whobear the Holy Priesthood shouldprize their standing enough to neverpermit themselves to go to these saloons and drink with the drunken, or to pursue a course whereby theylose the Spirit of God. Brethren, ifyou do this, you will be sorry for it; and you will have to repent of these sins and turn from them, in order toget forgiveness before the Lord. I know that this is the kingdom ofGod. I know this is the peoplewhom He has raised up. They have been kept, as I have often said,in the Spirit world the last six thou-sand years, to come forth and standin the flesh in this day and build up this Church and kingdom and warn this generation of the judg-ments which await them. Weoccupy this position before the Lord. Then let us not betray our trust.  As the Lord said to the Prophet Joseph, in answer to his prayer while in Liberty jail:"Behold, there are many called, butfew are chosen. And why are theynot chosen?"Because their hearts are set so much upon the things of this world,and aspire to the honors of men, that they do not learn this one lessonâ€”"That the rights of the Priesthoodare inseparably connected with thepowers of heaven, and that the powersof heaven cannot be controlled norhandled only upon the principles ofrighteousness." [##Doctrine and Covenants 121:34-36##]There is not a man that breathes the breath of life today on the earth,who holds and honors that Priest-hood, but has power with theheavens, and he can go before the Lord and have his prayers heard and answered. This is what the Latter-day Saints should do. Weshould live in that way and manner that we can go before the Lord andask for those blessings, in faith and in power, that we need to sustain usto carry out the purposes of God here in the mountains of Israel.  This is necessary for our advance-ment. We live in a fast age.  Events are hastening on, and the Lord is going to cut His work short in righteousness, lest no flesh shouldbe saved. No matter about our persecutions; no matter about theadvantages our enemies may havefrom a political or temporal point of view. God holds your destinies,He holds the destinies of this nation and of all men in His own hands.  He governs and controls them. And His angels are ready and waiting to go forth and reap down the earth.  But the Lord will fulfil His promi-ses. Do not be discouraged, there-fore, with regard to these things.But we have got to be humble. Wehave got to be prayerful. We havegot to have faith in God, and to beunited, and carry out those princi-ples which the Lord requires at ourhands. All the organizations of thePriesthood have power. TheDeacon has power, through thePriesthood which he holds. So has the Teacher. They have power togo before the Lord and have their prayers heard and answered, as well as the Prophet, the Seer, or theRevelator has. It is by this Priest-hood that the work of God has beenaccomplished. It is by this Priest-hood that men have ordinancesconferred upon them, that their sins are forgiven, and that they are re-deemed. For this purpose it has been revealed and sealed upon our heads.Brethren and sisters, these are a few of the thoughts I have upon mymind. There is a union that Godrequires of every quorum in thisChurch, from the Presidency down;and when we set up our will and our views against those of our breth-ren, we want to be careful what we are doing. We should all do the will of God, laboring for light, for truth and for those things that westand in need of. Speaking of thelove of the Saints of God, no manknows the love that men bear oneanother who hold the Holy Priest-hood. It is above the love of women.  Why, when I traveled abroad alone, on my early missions, I would havedone almost anything to have met aMormon Elder. It was worth morethan gold to me to meet anybodythat was in the Church. Our breth-ren hereâ€”Brothers Cannon and Snow and othersâ€”were called inearly days, before they received the Apostleship, to go upon missions. They went forth and proved them-selves before heaven and earth. The Lord knows these men. They havebeen called by revelation. We should all be careful not to hurt thetender vine, nor to hurt one another. Love one another, sustain one an-

 other; and while we do live in the fleshlet us do our duty.Our reward is on the other side ofthe veil. No matter whether a manis rich or poor here. Riches are dangerous. It is better to be poor than rich. If a man gets riches enough to damn him, it is the worst calamity that can come upon him. As one said anciently, "Give me neither poverty nor riches." Many of us have traveled a great many years in the vineyard of the Lord,trying to save the souls of men andto lay up treasures in heaven. Thou-sands have been redeemed in thesetemples. You have one here in Logan. We have been called as Saviors upon Mount Zion, while thekingdom has been the Lord's. These are glorious principles. To be saved ourselves, and to save our fellow-men, what a glorious thing! What is gold and silver; what are theriches of this world? They allperish with the using. We pass away and leave them. But if wehave eternal life, if we keep thefaith and overcome, we shall rejoicewhen we go upon the other side of the veil. I rejoice in all these things. There is hardly any princi-ple the Lord has revealed that I have rejoiced more in than in the redemption of our dead; that we will have our fathers, our mothers, ourwives and our children with us inthe family organization, in themorning of the first resurrection and in the Celestial Kingdom. These are grand principles. They are worth every sacrifice. When we get home with God and with the Prophets and Apostles we will rejoice exceedingly."Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heartof man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love Him."Brethren and sisters, am I glad to meet with you, and to have theprivilege of bearing my testimony. This is the Church of God. The Lord has a good people hereâ€”thesons and daughters of Abraham, whose lives have been hid withChrist in God, and you have known it not. The Priesthood has beenhanded down from Father Abra-ham, through the lineage of our forefathers, unto us in this last dis-pensation and fulness of times.Then let us be true and faithful; let us honor God; let us try to keep His commandments; let us rememberour prayers and do our duty, and especially be unitedâ€”united to theLord, united to the Holy Ghost, united to one another, that we maycarry out the principles in our dayand time; which may God grant, for Christ's sake. Amen.

 Paris IdahoDec 17th 1895President W Woodruff. Salt Lake City.Dear BroI received your letter of the 14th per Bro Reynolds, this morning, in relation to Bro Herbert Horsley, and by thesame mail came Bro Horsley himself with a letter from hisBishop.Bro Horsley manifested a very good disposition, andI believe he is now under the influence of the right spirit, and I have considerable confidence that he will do a good work. He is an old friend of mine, and we had a confidential conver-sation which resulted in withdrawing any objection on my partto his going on his mission.I told him that the information the Presidency actedupon was sent by me, and why I felt under an obligation to send it. He did not dispute what I had heard. I had in the meantimesent for his Bro Thos Horsley, my informant, not knowing but HerbrHerbert might request my authority, but he did not, and I of-course let it rest not wishing to have possible trouble.Bro Horsley has not been slandered. The Bishops lettersdo not defend him, or justify him, only as to his presentdesires, all from good feelings on their part, as they think withall his friends that this mission is a turning point in BroHorsleys life, and I have better hopes today for him than Ihave had for many years. I believe this check has been a blessingto him, and he went away feeling first-rate.I make a somewhat lengthy statement, as I do not wish to beconsidered too particular, and if I told you how long we have

General Doniphansaid in St. Louis, that, "if he had one thousand Mormon Boys, the same as the Mormon Battalion, he could do moregood than all the United States soldiersthat were there:" I say, if he had beena Mormon he would have been chargedwith treason, although the governmentis good, and the Constitution is as good ascould be framed.He then exhorted the Presiding Bishopto settle with the First Presidency and all the Bishops, and require their tithing, the one-tenth of all their real estate, ofthe value of their farms and possessions,and all they have got, and then see thatthe Bishops settle with every man, and that he pays his tithing or we will disfel-lowship him from the Church. I will sell every particle of my property if a mancan be found who will pay the cash, andI will put it all into the hands of BishopHunter, and I will begin anew, and infive years God will so bless me that Ishall be richer than any man in this community.He then called on the First Presidency,the Twelve Apostles, High Priests, Seven-ties, and every person to know if they werewilling to do as he told them, when allhands were immediately raised.He lifted his hands on high and withall the powers of the Holy Priesthoodvested in him, he blessed the Saints in thename of the Lord God of Israel, when allthe people cried, Amen.On motion the Conference was ad-journed to the 6th October next, at teno'clock, A.

We are heldresponsible for the sons and daughtersthat have been given us. I meet withsons of President Kimball, with sonsof President Young, with sons ofPresident Taylor, and with sons ofApostles who have passed away. I re-joice when I meet them. Their fathershelped lay the foundation of this work.They labored to promote the interestsand welfare of Zion. I rejoice to seetheir posterity on the earth. I hope allthese young men bear a portion of thePriesthood, and that they will magnifytheir callings. The eyes of theirfathers who dwell in the spirit world,are over them. Their bodies are inthe tomb; but their spirits areawake. They are mingling withthe righteous. And they have ananxiety about the welfare of theirchildren here. I am anxious myselfto have the rising generation take holdof this work; and I hope we will notdisappoint our Heavenly Father. Weshould read and study these revelationsof God and lay them to heart, and in-asmuch as we do this, they will proveof profit unto us.Brethren and sisters, I am glad tomeet with you, and to bear my testi-mony to you of the Gospel of Christ.As I have often said, I have lived tomore than the allotted age of man.I have lived while most everybodywith whom I was acquainted in Kirt-land and Nauvoo has passed to theother side of the veil. I expect to gothere myself, the same as the rest ofmy brethren. But while I live I wantto be true and faithful to my God andto the Saints. One of the greatestblessings of God to me has been thefact that myself and counselors live inthe hearts of the Latter-day Saints, andI have felt to be humbled in the dustbefore the Lord for this. We knowthat you pray for us. We know thatyou have respect for us. And we liveupon this principle. God has led thisChurch from the beginning, byprophets and inspired men. Hewill lead this Church until thescene is wound up. He will neitherpermit me nor any other man to leadthis Church astray. If I turn fromthe commandments of God and at-tempt to lead the people astray, theLord will remove me out of my placefor the Lord has set His hand to leadthis people by revelation and by in- spired men. The Lord has "chosenthe weak things of the world to con-found the things which are mighty;* * and things which are not,to bring to nought things that are."  We feel our weaknesses. I wish my-self that I were a better man thanI am. Of course, I have endeavored todo about the best I could in my weakway. I still wish to do so. But I amdependent upon the Lord and uponthe prayers of the Saints, the same asmy brethren. I pray God to bless you and me. I pray that He will seal uponthe hearts of the Saints of God theteachings that we have heard duringthis conference. This is my prayer inthe name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

 THE DESERET NEWS.The Deseret News.TRUTH AND LIBERTYGEORGE Q. CANNON --- EDITORWednesday,  Apr. 8, 1868.THIRTY-EIGHTH GENERAL CONFERENCE.Elder Wilford Woodruff spoke of thework to be performed in this dispensa-tion by the people of God, and the pri-vileges bestowed upon them, comparedwith the labors required of and the pri-vileges bestowed upon the people ofpreceding dispensations. Seeing thegreatness of the work to be performed,the question which every Latter-daySaint should ask himself is, "What can I do to advance the purposes of God."  The Lord has declared by His prophetsin all preceding dispensations, that inthis one He will redeem the earth fromthe power of Satan, and set up Hiskingdom never more to be thrown down. We are engaged in that work, and we should seek diligently to per-form our duties in connection there-with, and fulfil the purposes of the Lord.

Made some very interesting remarks about the early days of the Church. Prophesied that the day was near at hand when the vail would be raised, and theminds of the young men and women would be filled with the spirit of thework. The day would come when the cities of the Saints would not have saloons, because the Saints would not support them. Admon-ished the young men to refrain from all evil ways and forsake all evil practices.

 THE DESERET WEEKLY.President Wilford WoodruffI want to say to all Israel that the step which I have taken in issuing this manifesto has not been done without earnest prayer before the Lord. I am about to go into the spirit world, like other men of my age. I expect to meet the face of my Heavenly Father â€“ the Father of my spirit; I expect to meet the face of Joseph Smith, of Brigham Young, of John Taylor, and of the Apostles, and for me to have taken a stand in anything which is not pleasing in the sight of God, or be-fore the heavens, I would rather have gone out and been shot. My life is no better than other men's. I am not ignorant of the feelings that have been engendered through the course I have pursued. But I have done my duty, and the nation of which we form a part must be responsible for that which has been done in relation to this principle.The Lord has required at our hands many things that we have notdone, many things that we wereprevented from doing. The Lord required us to build a Temple in Jackson County. We were pre-vented by violence from doing it. He required us to build a Temple in Far West, which we have not been able to do. A great many things have been re-quired of us, and we have not been able to do them, because of those that surrounded us in the world. This people are in the hands of God. This work is in the hands of God, and He will take care of it. Brother George Q. Cannon told us about the lies that are abroad. It is a time when there have been more lies told about Mormonism than almost any other subject ever presented to the human family. I often think of what Lorenzo Dow said with re-gard to the doctrine of election. Says he: "It is like this: You can, and you can't; you will, and you won't; you shall, and you shan't; you'll be damned if you do, and you'll be damned if you don't." That is about the condition we as Latter-day Saints are in. If we were to undertake to please the world, and that was our object, we might as well give up the ship; we might have given it up in the beginning. But the Lord has called us to labor in the vineyard; and when our nations passes laws, as they have done, in regard to this principle which we have presented to the Conference, it is not wisdom for us to make war upon sixty-five millions of people. It is not wisdom for us to go forth and carry out this principle against the laws of the na-tion and receive the consequences. That is in the hands of God, and He will govern and control it. The Church of Christ is here; the Zion of God is here, in fulfilment of these revelations of God that are con-tained in these holy records in which the whole Christian world profess to believe. The Bible could never have been fulfilled had it not been for the raising up of a prophet in the last days. The revelations of St. John could never have been fulfilled if the angel of God had not flown through the midst of heaven, "having the everlasting Gospel to preach to them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to Him; for the hour of His judgment is come." Was that angel going to visit New York, Philadel-phia, Boston, and the world, and call the people together and preach to them? Not at all. But the Lord raised up a Prophet. The angel of God delivered that Gospel to that Prophet. That Prophet organized a Church; and all that He has prom-ised in this code of revelations (the Book of Doctrine and Covenants) has been fulfilled as fast as time would admit. That which is not yet fulfilled will be.Brethren and sisters, it is our duty to be true to God and to be faithful. Make your prayers known unto the Lord. The Lord has told us what He will do concerning many things. He will fulfill His word. Let us be careful and wise, and let us be satis-fied with the dealings of God with us.  If we do our duty to one an-other, to our country and to the Church of Christ, we will be justi-fied when we go into the spirit world. It is not the first time that the world has sought to hinder the fulfillment of revelation and prophecy. The Jewish nation and other nations rose up and slew the Son of God and every Apostle but one that bore the Priesthood in that day and generation. They could not establish the kingdom; the world was against them. When the Apostles asked Jesus whether He would at that time restore again the kingdom of Israel, He replied: "It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power." He did not say it would be established then; but He taught them to pray: "Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy king-dom come. Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven." It is a long time since that prayer was offered, and it has not been fulfilled until the present generation. The Lord is preparing a people to receive His kingdom and His Church, and to build up His work. That, breth-ren and sisters, is our labor.I want the prayers of the Latter-day Saints. I thank God that I have seen with my eyes this day that this people have been ready to vote to sustain me in an action that I know, in one sense, has pained their hearts. Brother George Q. Cannon has laid before you our position. The Lord has given us commandments concerning many things, and we have carried them out as far as we could; but when we cannot do it, we are justified. The Lord does not require at our hands things that we cannot do.This is all I want to say to the Latter-day Saints upon this subject. But go before the Lord and ask Him for light and truth, and to give us such blessings as we stand in need of. Let your prayers ascend into the ears of the God of Sabaoth, and they will be heard and answered upon your heads, and upon the heads of the world. Our nation isin the hands of God. He holdstheir destiny. He holds the desti-nies of all men. I will say to the Latter-day Saints, as an Elder inIsrael and as an Apostle of the LordJesus Christ, we are approachingsome of the most tremendous judg-ments God ever poured out upon the world. You watch the signs of the times, the signs of the coming of the Son of Man. They are be-ginning to be made manifest both in heaven and on earth. As has been told you by the Apostles, Christ will not come until these things come to pass. Jerusalem has got to be rebuilt. The Temple has got to be built. Judah has got to be gathered, and the House of Israel. And the gentiles will go forth to battle against Judah and Jerusalem before the coming of the Son of Man. These things have been revealed by the prophets; they will have their fulfilment. We are approaching these things. All that the Latter-day Saints have to do is to be quiet, care-ful and wise before the Lord, watch the signs of the times, and be true and faithful; and when you get through you will understand many things that you do not today.  This work has been raised up by the power of Almighty God. These El-ders of Israel were called from the various occupations of life to preach as they were moved upon by the Holy Ghost. They were not learned men; they were the weak things of this world, whom God chose to con-found the wise, "and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are." We are here on that principle. Others will be gathered on that principle.  Zion will be redeemed, Zion will arise, and the glory of God will rest upon her, and all that Isaiah and the other prophets have spoken con-cerning her will come to pass. We are in the last dispensation and fulness of time. It is a great day, and the eyes of all the heavens are over us and the eyes of God Him-self and all the patriarchs and pro-phets. They are watching over you with feelings of deep interest, for your welfare; and our prophets who were slain and sealed their testimony with their blood, are mingling with the Gods, pleading for their brethren. Therefore, let us be faithful, and 
 Such are my circumstances at the presenttime, but I never wish to shirk a dutyand if, knowing my situation, you wishme to go I stand ready and willing toperform to the best of my poor abilitythat which is required at my hands, theLord being my helper.Your brother in the gospelWilliam Reast.I fear Bp.

 DISCOURSE Delivered by President Wilford Woodruff,Sunday Morning, October 9th, 1892,at the Semi-Annual Conference, heldin the Tabernacle, Salt Lake City,Utah.I feel disposed to try to address thisassembly of Latter-day Saints forawhile this morning; but I wish to saythat I need not only the strict atten-tion but the faith and prayers of theSaints of God, for no man can fill theplace which I or these Apostles occupy,to fulfil the command of God and therequirements of the Latter-day Saints,except by the inspiration of AlmightyGod. This is a truth that has remainedon the earth from the day of FatherAdam to this hour.I have some things upon my mind Iwould like to lay before this assemblyif I can get sufficient of the spirit ofinspiration to do it. To commencewith, I want to bear my testimony tothese Latter-day Saints and to theworld that I am held responsible be-fore God, the angels and the heavenlyhosts for the testimony which I bearbefore you; and so is every man whobears record of the Son of God and ofthe work of God in this or any othergeneration. These Latter-day Saintsbear record to the world, and haveborne record for almost a generationpast, that Joseph Smith was a Prophetof God; that they know this work is ofGod, and hat this is the Church ofJesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. They are held responsible for this, andif they bear a true testimony, the na-tions of the earth who hear that testi-mony will be held responsible for theuse they make of it. Do you ask mehow I know this is the work of God,and that Joseph Smith is a Prophetof God? I will tell you howI know. I know it by the revelationsof Jesus Christ and by the inspirationof the Lord. If I may be allowed torefer to myself without being consider-ed egotistical, I will tell you why Ibear this testimony.Eighty-five years have passed overmy head since I first tabernacled inthe flesh. Almost sixty years of thatperiod I have been a member of theChurch of Jesus Christ of Latter-daySaints. During that time I have bornesome portion of the Holy Priesthood,and for fifty-three years I have occu-pied the position of the Apostleship, inconnection with my brethren. I havealso traveled abroad and at home.  Ihave been taught from my childhood up by the revelations of God in the records of divine truth that have been given to us, that there is one God, and that there is one Jesus Christ, who is the Savior of the world, and the only Savior pertaining to this world and to the redemption thereof. I have been taught that there is one Priesthood, in its two divisions. I have been taught that there is one Holy Ghost, and that there is one Gospel and one set of ordinances for the salvation of the whole posterity of Adam, and only one. I have been taught that these ordinances are the same in every age of the world. Whoever reads the New Testament can see the testimony of the Apostles that there was but one Gospel in that day and generation; and that Gospel was taught by Adam himself to his posterity. The same Gospel was taught by Moses, and by all the patriarchs and prophets down to the days of Jesus Christ. There was but the one Gospel. But the promise was that whoever received that Gospel should receive the Holy Ghost and the gifts thereof, and these gifts were made manifest from generation to generation when the God of heaven had a people on the face of the earth.In traveling during these sixty years that I have been in the Church, abroad and at home, I have been associated with the Elders of Israel in the administration of these ordinances to the human family. What has been the result? Remember now what I told you, that I am held responsible for my testimony. I have traveled, I may say, in the midst of visions, in the midst of the administration of angels, in the midst of the power of God. In connection with my brethren, I have laid hands upon the sick, and they have recovered. We have laid hands upon the blind, and they have seen; upon the deaf, and they have heard; upon the lame, and they have walked; upon those possessed with devils, and they were cast out; and even unto the resurrection of the dead. Those gifts and graces that have followed the servants of God in every age of the world have been associated with this Church from the day of its organization until this hour. These are truths in the sight of high heaven, and I will meet them there when I go to the other side of the veil. Therefore, if there are any strangers here, I bear testimony to these things, for I know they are true. The inspiration of the Holy Ghost deceives no man, and when any people receive this Gospel and this Priesthood, they know for themselves whether the work is of God or not. Yes, we lay hands upon the sick, and while we do so, the Spirit and power of God comes upon us, from the crown of our head to the soles of our feet. We lay hands upon men to ordain them to the Priesthood, and the power of God rests upon the men who administer. These thirty thousand Elders who dwell here in the mountains of Israel, when they go to the nations of the earth and get up and declare the Gospel of Jesus Christ to the world, the Holy Ghost is with them. They bear a testimony that rejoices the hearts of men, and men receive that testimony, and everything they promise them is fulfilled to the very letter.This is the reason why I know that Joseph Smith was a Prophet of God, and that this is the Church of God on the earth. And I wish many times that I had power to express to the Latter-day Saints what is in my heart, and what the vision of my mind opens unto me in those seasons when I am inspired with the Spirit and power of God to see what lies before this people and before this generation. Oh! ye Latter-day Saints, you talk about revelation, and wonder if there is any revelation. Why, bless your souls, say nothing about the Apostles and Elders around me, these mountains contain thousands upon thousands of devoted women, holy women, righteous women, virtuous women, who are filled with the inspiration of Almighty God. Yes, these women have brought forth an army of sons and daughters in these mountains by the power of God, and these sons and daughters partake of the inspiration of their mothers, as well as of their fathers. I will ask you, what are these Apostles doing when they rise up and preach to you?  What are these Elders of Israel doing when they bear record here to the Latter-day Saints and to the world, if they have not inspiration and revelation? There is not a man on the footstool of God Almighty today who has power to preach the Gospel and testify to its truth, only by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost. Yes, we have revelation. The Church of God could not live twenty-four hours without revelation. We do not have as much as we ought to have; and when I look at the work that has been piled up for these Latter-day Saints to bear off in the world, I feel as though we need a good deal of

 APOSTLE WOODRUFFfelt moved upon to speak a fewwords to the Conference, by bearinghis testimony to what John had justfinished saying, as also to what Can-non had promulgated as Gospel inthe forenoon, for they were oracles ofGod, and it was not the privilege ofone man alone to have revelation, butit was the duty of all the Saints to befull of revelation, so that they might walk through life with the light ofthe Holy Spirit shining on their path.It was the duty of those who shouldcharter ships for the emigration of theSaints to have it; it was the duty ofBrother John D. T. McAllister, tobe filled with the spirit of revelationevery day in the St. George Temple,so that he could prevent any manfrom robbing another of his deadwives. The Prophet Joe Smith bap-tized thousands before he kept anyrecord of the baptisms. But he didnot know it all. For twenty yearsthe endowments had been given in a little house in the Temple block, butthe whole light had not been revealedthen. Only after the St. George Temple was completed did the Lordlet the priesthood intoTHE WHOLE SECRET.Then he showed the Prophet Brigham many new things, as alsothe preacher, Woodruff. There wereabout twenty men and twenty womenadministering the holy ordinance inthe St. George temple, all for no-thing and boarding themselves. Farbe it from the Apostles to make mer-chandise of the gifts and blessings ofGod, but the brethren and sistersmust live by eating, and thereforethe many who are intending to gothrough the temple from this timeforward, must take along their tem-ple offerings to lay upon the altar.As to tithing, take hold and go to,now, said the preacher, and pay what you owe.THERE'S MILLIONS IN IT!Your dead will be after you intones of ten thousand thunders if youdon't, because they are interested inthis great work. And now, our sis-ters, God bless them forever, saidWilford, let them go too and lay upthe wheat while it is cheap, for thegreat famine which is coming uponthe world. "Somehow or 'nother,the brethring have got an idle [idea] intheir heads, that there ain't agoin' tobe no famin, but there is; the Lordhas said so, and the Lord don't lie,for he's agoin' to pour out the [whole]of his wrath upon the wicked, andspread war and [destruction] among the nations of the earth with fire and sword and pestilence and famine onevery hand, and lay up your wheat,brethring. Plant out mulberrytrees instead of these nasty,rotten cottonwoods, and use 'emtoo, and listen to the counsels of theholy priesthood, and manufactureeverything we need so that if theLatter-day Saints are cut off fromthe rest of the world they can be in-dependent, for Babylon is going tofall; the Lord has said so, andTHE LORD DON'T LIE,and support our own publications,especially the Woman's Exponent forthe sisters on it are doing a noblework." Here the Apostle caught his breath and subsided. 
 THE DESERET WEEKLY.President Wilford Woodruff.then addressed the congregation. Inthe year 1833 he had heard the firstGospel sermon. In the first year afterhaving embraced the Gospel, he hadheld the office of a Teacher. In the second year he was ordained a Priest.The following year he became an Elderand the next he was ordained a mem-ber of the quorum of Seventies. Forabout fifty-two years he had been a member of the quorum of the Twelve.The speaker would say that duringthis time, he had endeavored to preachthe Gospel to the world, and in so do-ing had traveled enough to go roundthe world six times, yet he had nottried to preach or to minister in the ordinances of the Kingdom of God, except by the power of Jesus Christ. And now after having labored so manyyears he felt still as much dependent on the Holy Spirit as ever, and on the faith and prayers of the Saints. Therenever was a Prophet on the earth whocould instruct the children of men ex-cept by the power of the Priesthood.The speaker then very strongly re-futed some of the slanders that havebeen hurled against the people of God, even by prominent men who havevisited the Territory. He made aneloquent appeal for liberty of con-science. The Latter-day Saints accordto all men freedom to worship God ac-cording to the dictates of their con-sciences, and we ask for ourselves onlywhat we are willing should be enjoyedby others. The speaker wished theblessings of God to rest abundantly onthe Conference, and all the people. 
 PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFFspoke briefly on the subject treated byElder Merrill. 
 THE DESERET WEEKLY.leave events in the hands of God, and He will take care of us if we do our duty.I pray God that He will bless these Apostles, Prophets and Patriarchs, these Seventies, High Priests and Elders of Israel, and these Latter-day Saints, who have entered into covenant with our god. You have a great future before you. You have kept the commandments of God, so far as you have had the opportunity, and by receiving the Gospel of Christ and being faithful your reward is before you. Your history is written and is be-fore you.  I will say that this nation, and all nations, together with presi-dents, kings, emperors, judges, and all men, righteous and wicked, have got to go into the spirit world and stand before the bar of God. They have got to give an account of the deeds done in the body. There-fore, we are safe as long as we do our duty. No matter what trials or tribulations we may be called to pass through, the hand of God will be with us and will sustain us. I ask my Heavenly Father to pour out His Spirit upon me, as His servant, that in my advanced age, and during the few days I have to spend here in the flesh, I may be led by inspiration of the Al-mighty. I say to Israel, the Lord will never permit me nor any other man who stands as the President of this Church, to lead you astray. It is not in the programme. It is not in the mind of God. If I were to attempt that, the Lord would remove me out of my place, and so He will any other man who at-tempts to lead the children of men astray from the oracles of God and from their duty. God bless you. Amen.

I pray that we may be faithful to the holy principles we have received. Amen. 
 more inspiration and revelation than we have. We want our souls to be wide open to the things of God, and to understand our position and destiny. I realize, Latter-day Saints require at my hands, as President of theChurch of Jesus Christ of Lat-ter-day Saints, many things. They also require many things at the hands of my counselors and these Apostles. We can accomplish what is required of us if we have the faith and the as-sistance of the Latter-day Saints andthe power of God; but without that we can do nothing.I will say a few words with regard to another dispensation. The whole Christian world profess to believe in the Bible. You look through that book, and you will not find a single in-stance of a Prophet, or an Apostle, or an inspired man going forth to preach the Gospel except by the power of the holy and everlasting Priest-hood. No man has had power to go forth and administer in the ordi-nances of salvation without thatPriesthood, from Adam down. Father Adam was a great High Priest. So were his sons that were with himâ€”Seth, Enos, Jared, Canaan, Mahala-leel, Enoch and Methuselah; and a great many others bore the holy Priesthood. [##Doctrine and Covenants 107:53-56##] All that Moses did was by the power of the holy Priest-hood. All that Jesus Christ and the Apostles did was by the power of the Priest-hood. Jesus Christ was our great High Priest, and He came into theworld and laid down His life as a great sacrifice for the redemption of the world. It is that dispensation that I wish to say a few words about. It was rather a peculiar dispensation. The Savior came to the Jewish nationâ€”to His ownâ€”through the loins of Abra-ham, Isaac and Jacob, and David. [##Matthew 1:1-16##] The Jewish nation rejected Him. He la-bored until they put Him to death. He lived only three years and a half after He entered the ministry. He lived long enough, however, to choose twelve Apostles, to organize a church, to warn that nation, and to declare unto them what would come upon their heads. Moses had also told the Jewish nation of these things inhis day, by the inspiration of the Lord. Has one jot or title fallen unfulfilled?Not one. When the Savior suffered that ignominious death on the cross,and was about to give up the ghost, He said, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do." [##Luke 23:34##] Is not that a strange saying for a man who was being crucified and about to gointo the spirit world? But Jesus saweverything that would befall the Jew-ish nation, and well might He makesuch a remark. He saw that one thousand eight hundred years after His death this yoke of bondage and trial and tribulation would rest upon the posterity of Judah, and he was ready to forgive them. No, they did not know what they did. They did not comprehend it. They did not understand that they were put-ting to death their Shilohâ€”the king of the Jews, their great Redeemer. They were too overwhelmed with darkness and iniquity to comprehend this. But, as I was saying, Jesus chosetwelve Apostles. They were fisher-men, weak and illiterate. But the Lord has always chosen the weak things of this world, instead of the great, and the learned, and the rich, and the powerful of the earth. Why has He done it? That He might have instruments that He could handleâ€”men who would obey Him, who would take His counsel and carry out His commandments. In preparing this dispensation in which we live the Lord has known perfectly well what lay before us. He has known the mighty events that were to be heapedupon the heads of both Jew and Gentile, Saint and sinner, Zion and the world; and He has prepared an element to do this work of His, which He has gathered here in the mountains of Israel. But in the days of the Savior it was a dispensa-tion of sacrifice; and Jesus Christ and the Apostles only lived a little while after they were chosen, to warn the nation in which they dwelt and that generation. Jesus Christ was crucified, the Apostles were put to death, and most every man who bore the Priest-hood was slain, excepting John the Revelator. The Lord had ordained him to live, and he did not die, but remains today upon the face of theearth, in fulfilment of the promises of God to him. [##John 21:21-23##] But in that day they had not the privilege of building the Zion of God or the Kingdom of God. It was not a dispensation prepared for that. These men laid down their lives, and the judgments of God overtook the Jewish nation, in fulfillment of the pre-dictions of the Savior and the Pro-phets. Moses told them in his day, "And thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body, the flesh of thy sons and ofthy daughters, which the Lord thy God hath given thee, in the siege, and in the straitness, wherewith thine ene-mies shall distress thee." [##Deuteronomy 28:53##] All thiscame to pass, and the kingdom was taken from the earth, the holy Priest-hood was taken up to God, who gaveit, and the Church went into the wil-derness, and there remained until theday set for its restoration to the world.But I want to speak more particularly about this great and last dispensation, in which the Lord has said, through the mouths of all the patriarchs and prophets, a mighty work should be per-formed. It is different, my brethren and sisters, from the days of the Savior.  Ido not believe there ever was a greater dispensation than the one in which you and I live, because in it is cen-tred the fulfillment of all prophecy and all revelation that has been mani-fest looking to the final restoration of all things before the coming of the Son of Man. I want to speak of our condition today before the Lord. When the Savior died He went to preach to the spirits in prison. Most all thepeople from the days of Noah to thatday had died without the Gospel, and Jesus went and preached to them. [##1 Peter 3:19-20##] They had this work resting upon them in that day. In this day and generation we have in the Bible, the Book of Mormon and the Doctrine and Covenants the history of the Latter-day Saints and of the world. You are my witnesses today that thispeople are here in fulfillment of these revelations and prophecies. We have had a Prophet raised up in these lastdays, as great a Prophet as ever breathed the breath of life, save JesusChrist, and He was raised up for thepurpose of laying the foundation of this work. And how is this dispensation and this work to com-mence? I would like to have the Christian world read the revelations of St. John. There you have before you a picture of what awaits this genera-tion. You have there proclaimed thatin the commencement of this great and last work in the last days an angel of God would fly through the midst of heaven, having the everlasting Gospelto preach to them that dwell on the earth, "and to every nation, and kin-dred, and tongue, and people, saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and giveglory to Him, for the hour of His judgment is come." [##Revelation 14:6-7##] Yes, ye Latter-day Saints, the hour of God's judgmentis come." The Lord raised a great Prophet unto us. He was a mighty man, although illiterate, in one sense of the word. The Lord called upon himto perform this work, and he not only received the visitation of angels, but even the voice of God. This is the only dispensation that I have ever read of in which the Father and Son both appeared to the man whom He had chosen to establish His Church. Joseph Smith received this great honor. He was a Prophet of God. I have traveled with him a good manymiles. Speaking of the gifts and graces manifested by the Elders of Israel, I have seen Joseph Smith inone day go forth among the sick andcommand those that were dying to arise and be made whole, and they have leaped from their beds, been clothed, and walked out in the streetand followed the Prophet of God in his travels through the midst of the Saints of God. Can I doubt this work? Can you doubt it? I think not. No man that has had any experience in this work can doubt it. You remember Brother Fordham. He was breath-ing his last breath of life whenthe Prophet took him by the hand and commanded him in the name of Jesus of Nazareth to arise and be made whole. He leaped from his bed, was clothed, and walked out andinto the house of Brother JosephBates Noble, who is still living inthese mountains. He was also lyingat the point of death and was instantlyhealed by the power of God, through the voice of the Prophet of God. I name these things because I have had experience in them and have a right to mention them. The power of God waswith the Prophet, from the time he was ordained to the Priesthood until he was murdered. He lived some four-teen years after he laid the foundation of this work. And when he organized this Church he organized it in its full power and glory, and every gift andgrace, and every ordinance that belongs to the Church of God. Nothing was ever manifest in any age of the world but what was included in the organization of this Church. It was organized with Prophets, with Apostles, with Pastors, with Teachers, with helps and governments, withgifts and graces, and with the Mel-chisedek and Aaronic Priesthoods. Joseph Smith was true and faithful to death, and he was a mighty man of God, as may be seen by anyone whowill read that code of revelations whichhe left to usâ€”as sublime revelations asGod ever gave to man.Now, brethren and sisters, the foundation has been laid, and you arehere in these mountains of Israel. Myself and others have preached to you in England, in Scotland, in Wales, in the islands of the sea and

 April 14  THE DESERET NEWS.ELDER W. WOODRUFF said we had all learned by experience that we needed the Spirit of the Lord to help us in our public duties. Ifever there was a dispensation sincethe beginning of the world, that needed the spirit of inspiration, now was the time. We were living and were now engaged in the lastdispensation, and needed the as-sistance of prophets and apostles.Where were the great nations and their history, that once stood in mighty grandeur and power like Babylon, Tyre, Sidon, etc.? Not only had those cities been swept from the earth, but many others, all of whom had been the subjectsof prophecy in their turn by the humble servants and prophets ofGod, which prophecies had receiv-ed a literal fulfilment in the entire destruction of those cities, accord-ing to the word of the Lord. The Bible or stick of Judah containedrecords of many of those mightynations, that had been preserved. So with the Jaredites, Nephites and Lamanites, and their cities and temples, people who once dwelt on this continent. The only complete record now in existence in refer-ence to them is the Book of Mor-mon, or stick of Ephraim, broughtforth by the spirit of revelation. [##Ezekiel 37:15-20##]All the prophesies contained in the Bible and Book of Mormon, that had received a literal fulfil-ment, were a sure and certain guar-antee that others that pertained to this last dispensation would also be literally fulfilled in their time and season. Not one jot or title ofthe word of God would fail. [##Matthew 5:18##] God had decreed by prophets, in the Book of Mormon, that no nationshould be permitted to continue onthis continent and prosper unless they kept his commandments, but when the cup of their iniquity was full they should be utterly cut off and be destroyed. This continent was now occupied by aGentile people, who had slain theProphet Joseph and his brother Hyrum, cast the Saints from their midst and been persecuting them ever since their organization; and unless they repented and humbledthemselves before God and embrac-ed the Gospel, no power on theface of the earth could prevent the judgment of God being executed according to the prophecies of theservants of God. No previous dis-pensation was ever fraught with so many prophecies as this in which we lived. No man could indulge in fighting against God and his servants, without being cursed by the Almighty. There was no judge, president, or ruler that ever mea-sured arms with the Prophet Joseph Smith or Brigham Young, but what had withered under the dis-pleasure of God, and so it would continue to be. Wo be unto those who fought against Zion.He then reviewed the labors of the present Apostles and Elders who started out without purse and script, and exposed to hunger and cold, traveling thousands of milesfrom State to State on foot.He then exhorted the Saints to faithfulness, as this was not a time for trifling away our time, neglect-ing our prayers, and other du-ties that God required us to diligently observe. In a shorttime the parents of the present gen-eration among us, would be with Joseph and Hyrum, behind the veil, as a mighty work awaited them there. Then the responsibil-ities of this great work would rest upon the shoulders of our young people; hence, he said unto them,prepare yourselves for this labor.He then spoke of the value of keeping a record of the dealings of God among us a people. God had in-spired him to keep a record sincehe became a member of the Church,and he earnestly urged upon the young men to do the same. Baby-lon would be swept away, her li-braries would be burned up, and what records were kept by the ser-vants of God would be invaluable in the future for generations to come to read and trace the work of God as it daily transpired.He strongly recommended the Elders to cease spending their means in smoking and drinking,and other evil practices, and haveit devoted in educating the child-ren and we would hear nothing said about a five cent tax to sustain free schools.Prayer by ELDER WILFORDWOODRUFF. 
 THE DESERET NEWS.  Jan. 12DISCOURSEDELIVERED BYELDER WILFORD WOODRUFF,At the General Conference, ThursdayMorning, Oct. 7th, 1880.-------------REPORTED BY JOHN IRVINE.I AM pleased to have the opportun-ity of again meeting with my breth-ren and sisters in General Confer-ence. There is one thing that isvery clear to my mind with regard to myself and everybody else whoattempts to teach the Latter-daySaints, and that is we all need thespirit of the Lord, and without itwe cannot edify anybody, neithercan we build up Zion or do the work of God without the Holy Spirit. The prophets, the apostles, and allmen who have been called in every age of the world to labor for thekingdom of God have had tobe actuated by this principle, andthat is one reason, as Brother Car-rington has said, why the weak things of this world, whom the Lord has chosen, have confidence inGod to go forth to lift up their voicesand preach the gospel of Christ anddo the work which is required attheir hands.It is certainly interesting to anyreflecting mind to contemplate thedealings of God with the inhabit-ants of the earth in the various agesand dispensations almost from thecreation of the world as far as wehave any knowledge. I have oftenbeen struck, in reading ancient his-tory, with the dealings of God with some of the ancient cities of whichwe have some account in the Bible and other histories aside from that book. Forinstance there is Tyre [##Ezekiel 26##] and Sodom, [##Genesis 19##]Nineveh and Babylon the great [##Daniel 5##] ---these mighty cities that were builtas it were to defy all time and all power but God himself. Just asquick as Isaiah, Ezekiel, Joel, or any other prophet whom God raisedup to lift up his voice and declarethe word of the Lord concerning thedestiny of any of these cities, all the power of Nebuchadnezzar and Bel-shazzar, or any other king or priest who dwelt in these cities, ruled them, governed and controlled them, had no power to stay the ful-filment of the words of the servants of the Lord; these cities have beenoverturned, have been laid in thedust in fulfillment of the word ofGod whenever they were ripenedin iniquity. The Lord sent a poor weak man named Jonah to Nineveh,a great and mighty city, to go andwarn the inhabitants thereof to re-pent, or in forty days Nineveh shouldbe overthrown. Jonah thought it was a little too much for him, an obscure man, to go unto a great citylike Nineveh and tell the inhabit-ants that in a few days the city would be overturned, hence he fledinto Tarshish. For this he had a pecu-liar kind of experience for three days and three nights; you are all acquaint-ed with the history that I allude to.When Jonah, however, got on dryland again he went and fulfiled his mission to the inhabitants of Nine-veh. [##Jonah 1-3##] And I have many timesthought that if this generation was like unto the Ninevites the world would be different to what it is to-day. When the people heard the word of God they believed it. They went to work and repented and called upon the Lord, and we aretold "that God withheld the evil that he had said he would do unto them; and he did it." But I wantto say that in all these things, when the Lord has called upon men to la-bor in the building up of his king-dom, he has chosen the weak thingsof the world. And so it has beenthroughout the whole generations of men. In the days of Jesus Christ,the apostles chosen were illiteratemen, fishermen a good many ofthem; but the Lord gave them the apostleship, he gave them thepriesthood, and they were command-ed to go forth and preach the gospel.But they had to suffer death for their testimony.I desire now to refer to ourselves. In reflecting upon ancient days, letus look at our own position. The Lord raised up Joseph Smith. His his-tory -- his life, his works, his death --is before the world to-day. JosephSmith was an illiterate man, as far as worldly learning was concerned,but he was an instrument raised upby the Lord to lay the foundation of this great and last dispensation. TheLord held Joseph Smith responsible for the keys of the kingdom of God,for the revelations of heaven, forevery principle which the Lord hadrevealed to him. Joseph Smith wasa great man -- that is before the Lord, before the heavens, and before thisgeneration. He was ordained of God to lay the foundation of this Churchand Kingdom; he was true and faithful unto death, and when welook at what has followed the lay-ing of the foundation of this Church fifty years ago, withsix members, it is a marvel, it is amystery in the eyes of the world, and it is even to us as Latter-daySaints, to note the progress of thischurch and kingdom from that day until the present. The revelations which have been given through the Prophet Joseph Smith, as recorded in the Book of Doctrine and Coven-ants, have all had their fulfilment as far as time would admit. JosephSmith lived until he laid the founda-tion of this church and kingdom; helived until he received every key and principle and priesthood whichbelongs to this dispensation, and he lived until he sealed the same uponthe heads of other men. Every man that ever knew him, every el-der or every saint of God thatever traveled with him, or have heard him converse, canform some little idea of the spiritthat filled his bosom. I have seenhim from time to time, in my earlyacquaintance with him in Kirtland, smite his breast and say, "I wouldto God I could unbosom my feelingsto my friends." But he could not doit. It seems it was impossible forhim to reveal to the elders what God had revealed to him. Nevertheless he accomplished the work to which he had been ordained and set apartby the power of God. He lived, as I have already said, until he organ-ized the church in all its various or-ganizations. He chose the apostles,seventies, high council, high priests,and all the various officers in thechurch and kingdom of God, by rev-elation, and when he had finishedthis work, the Lord called himhome. He sealed his testimony with his blood, and wentto the other side of thevail. He holds the keys of the kingdom of God on both sides of thevail, and will hold them to the end-less ages of eternity. Apostles werecalled and set apart to carry on the work which he commenced. Manyof them who were associated with him have passed away, others re-main here in the flesh.If I could tell you the feelings ofmy own heart I would say to theapostles, seventies, high priests, andall the officers of this Church and kingdom, the God of heaven has raised you up, according to my faithand my view, and placed you here on the earth and watched over you until you have received the ordi-nances of the gospel. You are rais-ed up as a kingdom of priests. Youhold the power of the priesthood inyour hands, and I say you are heldresponsible before high heaven, be-fore the gods of eternity, before theheavenly hosts, and will be held ac-countable to the judgment day forthe manner you make use of thispriesthood and power which is putinto your hands. This is the con-[d]ition of all of us from the apostle-[ship] down through every depart-ment of this church and kingdom. There never was a generation sinceGod made the world that have hadgreater power, greater responsibili-ties, greater blessings, or that haveever had the kingdom of God placedupon their shoulders to remain on the earth until the coming of the Son of Man. Therefore, how greatthe responsibility resting upon us asapostles, as elders, and in every ca-pacity in which we are called to act.This is the way I view our position,and when I have enjoyed a portion of the spirit of God, when the vi-sion of my mind has beenopen to comprehend in anymeasure our relationship to God and the heavenly hosts, and the respon-sibility we are under here to theLord and to this generation, I havefelt that I would to God that the vailmight be lifted to the vision of theLatter-day Saints, that we might see ourselves as God sees us, and as theheavenly hosts see us. If we could only comprehend this we would feel in many respects different to what we do at present. We would be dili-gent. We would not have our heartsset on the things of this life as they many times are. Our labors are very great, very extensive. The Lord re-quires of us that which he has hardlyever required of any other genera-tion. We have the kingdom. We have got to establish it and maintain it by faith and good works with thehelp of God while we dwell here inthe flesh. We have these templesto build here in these valleys of themountains. This is one of the most important branches of the responsi-bility resting upon Latter-daySaints -- the redemption of our dead. I have often referred to this subject,because my mind has been opened to it, my desires have been exercised upon this principle. Nearly 1800years have passed away and over 50generations of men who have neverseen a Prophet or an Apostle, whohave never heard the gospel of JesusChrist, have gone into the spiritworld. They have gone there with-out the gospel, they are under no re-sponsibility to that law because theynever came under it. There aretherefore some fifty thousand mil-lion people to-day in the spirit world that have to be preached to by theElders of Israel. There was nobody to preach to them until Joseph Smithwent into the spirit world with thekeys of the kingdom of God and un-locked the prison door. The Prophet Joseph had this subject of the re-demption of the dead in his heart until the day of his death. He la-bored most diligently to this end.These millions will be preached to,and many will receive the truth,while those who dwell in the fleshhave this duty to perform as theirdescendants on the earth to go andbuild these temples that we may at-tend to ordinances for the dead which the dead cannot attend tothemselves. God requires this atour hands. It is our duty to enterinto these temples and redeem ourdead as far as we can, that we maybe justified when we go into the spirit world. We have all the branch-es, temporal and spiritual, of this Church and kingdom to carry out.We have got to build these cities, towns and villages. We have got tocultivate the earth, educate our chil-dren, train them up in the nurtureand admonition of the Lord, and itis our duty as a people to unite our-selves together according to the lawof God. We should not set our hearts too much upon the things of this world. The earth and theriches thereof is the Lord's. He willgive them to the Latter-day Saints as fast as they are prepared to re-ceive them. But I tell you I havethought many times that it is a ca-lamity for a man to become rich inthe midst of this people. It is ahard matter for a rich man to enterinto the kingdom of God. Men when they are poor can labor fortheir bread and feel thankful to theGod who gives it; but when we become millionaires our heartsbegin to set upon the things of thisworld. Not but what such men maykeep the commandments of God, do what is right and be justified. I donot make these remarks because Iwish to speak against the wealthy of the Latter-day Saints, or anybodyelse, but I speak of this that we should not permit our hearts to beset upon riches to deprive us of magnifying our calling before theLord. We have got to become rich,some time or other; the Saints of God will yet possess the earth.But the Lord holds us responsible asa people for the building up of hiskingdom. We have got to buildthese temples and redeem our dead.We have got to pay our tithing.This is a law which has been given unto us. We should obey the law oftithing as a people, so that we may be qualified to inherit eternal life.When I come to realize that mydestiny on the other side of the vaildepends upon the little time I haveto spend here, I feel that I have notime to throw away. We should seek for the Holy Spirit. We shouldmagnify our calling. This kingdomgiven unto you Latter-day Saints, is the kingdom of God. It is the king-dom that Daniel saw, it is the ever-lasting kingdom which has been spoken o[f] by all the holy prophetssince the world was made. [##Daniel 2:26-47##] Thelittle stone cut out of the mountainswithout hands, will roll until it fillsthe whole earth. The heavenlyhosts are looking to nobody else upon the footstool of God but the Latter-day Saints to accomplish this work. No other people have got the king-dom. No other people have receiv-ed the priesthood but the Latter-day Saints, and we will be held res-ponsible for the use we make of it.Therefore, I think we should be di-ligent, we should be faithful to our duties, we should look to the posi-tion which we occupy before theLord. Our blessings are great. Therevelations of heaven have beengiven unto us. We possess the Holy Ghost, it has been given tothis people. We have been gather-ed by it from among the nations ofthe earth through the instrumen-tality of weak and humble men whohave been called upon to preach the gospel. We regard this as being one of the strongest evidences of thisbeing the work of God. The world, however, hate us. This we re-gard as another evidence of the divinity of this work. Said the Savior in his day, "If the worldhate you, ye know that it hated mebefore it hated you. If ye were ofthe world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of theworld, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the worldhateth you." [##John 15:18-19##] The world hate thispeople, the priests of the dayespecially, and if they had the power they would wastethem away from off the face of the earth; but the Lord has said that he would break in pieces everyweapon that is formed against Zion.When the wicked stretch out their hands to destroy this kingdom of God, will they prevail? I think not. We have got the kingdom of God.The Lord is looking to us, the hea-venly hosts are looking to us, JosephSmith and the whole of the spirit world, who are righteous, are watch-ing this people with intense interest. They expect us to build Zion. Theyexpect us to build temples and re-deem our dead. They expect us to unites ourselves together and to keepthe faith and overcome the world,the flesh and the devil. They ex-pect these things at our hands, andI do hope that they may not be dis-appointed.We have every encouragement, my brethren and sisters, to be faith-ful. I thank God I have heard thisgospel. I thank God I have livedto see this people. I thank God thatI have been associated with prophetsand apostles. All the happiness, allthe joy and all the consolation I have ever had has been since I em-braced the gospel of Jesus Christ. Ihave a testimony for myself, as youhave for yourselves, that this is thework of God. I know it is the work of God. I know Joseph Smith was a prophet of the Lord. The Lord raised him up to lay the foundationof this Church and Kingdom. No man could do it of himself. Thevoice of God, the voice of the HolyGhost, the voice of inspiration hasdeclared these things from day to day and from year to year. It is by this power that we have been gathered together. Who could have gathered this people by anyother principle only by the gospel ofJesus Christ. Where is there a minister on the face of the earth -- a minister of the gospel or one whoprofesses to be such -- who dare go tothe nations of the earth and tell thepeople that if they receive his testi-mony and will go forth and be bap-tized, they shall receive the Holy Ghost? Is there any man on the earth dare do this? No one. No people ever has done it excepting the Latter-day Saints. Why darethey not do this? Because Godwould not back up their testimony,and if we had not been called ofGod, if this gospel had not been ofGod, we should have been found outa great many years ago. Whenwe go and declare these things we promise the sons and daughtersof Adam that if they will receive thegospel of Christ they shall receivethe Holy Ghost. We offer this inthe name of Israel's God. We bap-tize men and women, we lay hands upon them, and they do receive the Holy Ghost, and it bears record to them and they rise up and bear tes-timony of the truth of these things. It is by this power we have beengathered. It is by this power we shall build up Zion. We shall con-tinue to labor. We shall prosper.We shall have power to build these temples and dedicate them. We shall have power to build others and will continue this work until theSon of Man comes in the clouds of heaven to reward every man accord-ing to the deeds done in the body.Then let us as Elders of Israel round up your shoulders for thekingdom of God.  Let us strive toretain the Holy Spirit that we mayrealize our responsibility and be ready to magnify our calling and doour duty before the Lord.I pray God my Heavenly Fatherto let his blessing rest upon us dur-ing this conference -- upon Brother Taylor, the Apostles, the Elders of Israel, and those who teach us andinstruct us, for Christ's sake,Amen. 
 among the nations of the earth. Wehave declared unto you the Gospel ofJesus Christ. You have believed ourtestimony and have received it. Youwent forth and were baptized in waterfor the remission of your sins, andyou received the Holy Ghost by the power of God, and by that power you are here today. We mighthave preached to you till we had beenas old as Methuselah, but if our testi-mony had not been backed up by the power of God, you would have re-mained at home; you would not havebeen here in these mountains to fulfilthe revelations of God. These thingsare true, and you know theyare true. You know you receivedthe testimony yourselves, and by thisyou have been gathered together. Up-wards of sixty years have passed overour heads since the organization of this Church on the earth, and its history is before the world. It has been a little stone cut out of the mountains withouthands. We have had a terrible war-fare from the organization of this Church until today; but one thing iscomforting and encouraging: the Godof heaven inspired men thous-ands of years ago to tell exactlywhat these Latter-day Saints would do.They were of the house of Israel, scat-tered among the nations of the earth,and the Lord would stretch out Hishand and gather them together, andthey would go to the place that the old Patriarch said should belong to Joseph:Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruit-ful bough by a well; whose branches runover the wall. The archers have sorelygrieved him, and shot at him, and hated him: But his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob;(from thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel.) * * * The blessings of thyfathers have prevailed above the bles-sings of my progenitors unto the utmostbounds of the everlasting hills: they shallbe on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him that was separ-ated from his brethren.(##Genesis 49:22-26|Gen. xlix,22-26##).You are the descendants of this holy man of God. You have come here in fulfillment of these things.I do not expect that I will be able toanswer my mind in telling you how Ifeel with regard to these things,but I will do the best I can. You have beengathered to these mountains of Israel,led by a prophet, a seer, a revelator,and a mighty man. When we camehere we found a barren desert. Mensaid, "Go to California; you cannot do anything here." "No," PresidentYoung said, "we shall stay here; we shall build a temple here; we shallbuild a city here. This is what is ord-ained of God, and we shall accom-plish it." Judge, brethren and sisters, whether he was inspired or not. We have made a beginning. We havemade the desert to blossom as the rose, and laid the foundation for thegreat work of our God that is going tobe fulfilled in these mountains of Israel, and you will stand in holyplaces while the judgments of God work in the earth. Yes, let the world read these judgments of God and that which lies before all nations under heaven. These things will come to pass to the very letter. Then what is our duty and our position here?  The Lord told us through the Prophet Joseph in the beginning of this work that He was going to call Elders into the vineyard for the last time, to prune the vineyard. We have got to prepare it for the coming of the Son of Man. The wheat has got to be gathered into the garner before the chaff is burned. And the Elders of Israel have got to go forth and warn the inhabitants of theearth, as Joseph Smith told the Twelve Apostles the last time I saw him be-fore his martyrdom, when he laid be-fore us the work he was required to do. The Prophet said: "God has given tome every key, every power and princi-ple of salvation belonging to this great last dispensation; and I have sealed upon your heads every key, principle and power which God has sealed uponme. Now, you Apostles, round up your shoulders and bear off this king-dom, or you will be damned, saith theLord." I do not forget these things, and they are true. I believe I am the only man living in the flesh who was present on that occasion. This is ourposition, brethren and sisters, before the Lord. There is a tremendous responsibility upon these Latter-day Saints. We have the world to warn. We have to preachthe Gospel, and attend to those thingsthat God has committed to us. The Prophet Joseph and his brother Hyrumwere martyred, and they will have amartyr's crown. They have gone to the other side of the veil, to mingle with the Gods and to plead for their brethren, and they are faithful and diligent in their duties. But some of us are left behind. Since that time this work has gone on, and it has gotto continue, and we cannot avoid this. What the Lord requires at the hands of these Apostles, and Elders and Latter-day Saints is to warn the world, to preach the Gospel, to build up Zion, to carry out the purposes of the Lord, andto prepare ourselves to stand in holyplaces while the judgments of God work in the earth.Joseph Smith revealed unto us theprinciple of the redemption of the dead. There was no revelation I everread that gave me more joy and con-solation than that. Jesus Christ and the Apostles had to go to the spirits inprison and redeem those who had livedfrom the days of Noah down to theirgeneration. [##1 Peter 3:19-20##] Here we have one thous-and eight hundred years, during which millions and millions of the humanfamily have died without the Gospel ofChrist. They have gone into the spirit world, and the Lord expects these Lat-ter-day Saints to go forth and redeemthese dead, as they hold the keys of the salvation of their dead; so that when they go into the spirit world andmeet their fathers and their mothers and their relatives, they shall not say to them, "You held the keys of mysalvation, and you have not attended tothis work, and I am left here in prison."We should not neglect this. It is not only our duty to preach the Gospel and to warn the world, that they may be left without excuse in the day of God'sjudgment, but it is our duty to re-deem our dead. Joseph Smith, when he was martyred, went and opened the prison doors in the spirit world. So did those brethren that died in Zion's camp. Every Elder that has gone to the other side of the veil has a work to perform there, and thosein the spirit world will receive their testimony. But they cannot be bap-tized there. Their sons and daugh-ters who dwell in the flesh have to carry out this great and mighty work.Brethren and sisters, these are some of the duties that are required of us. We should open our eyes, and our ears, and our hearts, to see, hear and understand the great and mighty re-sponsibility that rest upon us. ThankGod, we have had power in this barrendesert to build three temples. Hun-dreds of thousands of the dead havebeen redeemed in these temples, and there are millions yet to be redeemed. Here is this Salt Lake Temple thatPresident Young laid the founda-tion of. We want to finish that temple and dedicate it unto the Lord. This is some of the work that is required of us. Theeyes of all the heavenly hosts are overthese Latter-day Saints, and they areover these sons and daughters that dwell in the mountains of Israel. God Himself and His Son Jesus Christ, who is our advocate with the Father, lookto us to do this work. The eyes of Joseph Smith and every Prophet and Saint of God who dwells in the spiritworld are watching over us. They cannot come here and build that Tem-ple. They are not ordained to that. But we are here in the flesh, and I ask, in the name of the Lord, and asa great favor of these Latter-day Saints, that we will unite together with our means and finish that Temple, that we may go into it and redeem our dead. Many of you have got thousands of relatives in the spirit world who are looking to you. They never heard the Gospel in life, but they willhear it, at the mouth of David Patten, Joseph Smith, Brigham Young, John Taylor, and these Apostles and Elders that have gone into the spirit world. But, as I said before, they cannot be baptized there. We can, and we must do it for them.This is how I feel about our position. We are here by the power of God. It is a marvel to me that we are as welloff as we are. It is a marvel to methat we have the power that we have. For there is a vast number of fallen spirits that are at war against God and His Christ, against this people and this Church, and against the redemption of the dead. Lucifer knows that ifthis Church prospers, his kingdom will fall. But God has sustained us, and will sustain us until we get through, if we do our duty. The hand of God isover us here, and Zion is a city set upon a hill, which cannot be hid. We are only small, and have only just begun the organization; but the Lord will hasten His work, and it will continue until all these promises of God will be fulfilled. There is where my faith rests and my consolation dwells. I know that God is true, and that the testimonies of all the Patri-archs and Prophets, have thus far beenfulfilled to the very letter. There is not a city nor a generation but has felt the chastening hand of God when theyhave undertaken to overthrow the work of God.I want to say something in relation to home industry. True, it is Sunday, but that matters not; for we are called to build up Zion temporally as well as spiritually. All that has been said in our Conference with regard to home industry is good. We want to con-tinue this, and as far as we possiblycan we should, as President Youngtold us, open doors of work 
 THE DESERET WEEKLY. 559DISCOURSEDelivered by President Wilford Wood-ruff at the General Conference,held in the Tabernacle, Salt LakeCity, Sunday morning, April 6,1890. [REPORTED BY ARTHUR WINTER. ]I feel that every heart in thiscongregation should be filled withgratitude to God for the blessingswe enjoy this morning, that somany of us have the privilege ofmeeting in this Tabernacle in peaceand quietude to worship God.I want to say to this large assem-bly that the President of the Church,or his Counselors, or the TwelveApostles, or any other man whodwells in the flesh, has no power inand of himself to instruct or edifythe Latter-day Saints; he can onlydo so by the power and blessings ofAlmighty God. In this respect Iam as weak as the least member ofthis Church and Kingdom. We areall dependent upon the Lord; and Ifeel this morning that I stand inneed, not only of the faith andprayers of the Latter-day Saints,but of the blessings of God and theHoly Spirit to assist me to declareunto the Latter-day Saints the wordof the Lord.I will say another thing. TheSaints of God in every age of theworldâ€”prophets, apostles and reve-latorsâ€”have been in such a positionthat they have had no chance to belifted up in the pride of their hearts,or to boast of their power andstrength to do the work of Godamong the children of men. Everyman who was acquainted with Jo-seph Smith and those who followedhim, knows full well that this wastheir condition while they dweltamong us. Joseph Smith was ahumble man. He was one of theweak instruments in the hands ofGod. He was raised up in this lastdispensation and fulness of times tolay the foundation of this greatChurch on the earth. He was taughtby the administration of an[g]els fromheaven. He knew full well that hisstrength lay in God and not in him-self. That is our condition at thepresent time. We have no chanceto be lifted up in the pride of ourhearts with regard to the positionwe occupy. If the President of theChurch or either of his Counselors orof the Apostles, or any other man,feels in his heart that God cannotdo without him, and that he isespecially important in orderto carry on the work ofthe Lord, he stands upon slipperyground. I heard Joseph Smith saythat Oliver Cowdery, who was thesecond Apostle in this Church, saidto him, "If I leave this Church itwill fall." Said he, "Oliver, youtry it." Oliver tried it. He fell;but the Kingdom of God did not.I have been acquainted with otherApostles in my day and time whofelt that the Lord could not dowithout them; but the Lord gotalong with His work without them.I say to all menâ€”Jew and Gentile,great and small, rich and poorâ€”thatthe Lord Almighty has power with-in Himself, and is not dependentupon any man, to carry on His 
 516 THE DESERET WEEKLY.President Wilford WoodruffAddressed the Conference. He said: I feel this morning to offer up thegratitude of my heart to God, my Heavenly Father, that my life hasbeen preserved to again meet in asemi-annual Conference with theSaints. I feel thankful that I havethe privilege of meeting with so many of the Apostles, Elders andSaints who have assembled here on this occasion.Our Heavenly Father revealedfrom heaven, over sixty years ago, to the inhabitants of the earth,through the mouth of the Prophetof God, whom He raised up, that He had set His hand once more, for the last time, to prune His vine-yard and to prepare the people of the earth for the coming of theSon of Man. Over sixty years havepassed away since those revelations were given. The Lord called upon the children of men, to take uponthemselves the name of Christâ€”those who were willing to enter inthe vineyard of the Lord and preachthe Gospel of Christ to them. He gave us to understand that we shouldbe called to go forth and preach themessage of the Son of God in thislast dispensation of the fulness of times. Many of those who engagedto carry out and fulfill thesepromises of God to mankind are today in the spirit world. Theyhave closed their mission, theyhave borne their testimony, they have fulfilled the object of theircreation, they have magnified thehigh and holy Priesthood which the God of heaven has sealed upon their heads, to go forth and admin-ister in the ordinances of life andsalvation. A few of us are left; some of us still remain here in theflesh, and we are still called upon tolabor. We are still called to officiatein the Holy Priesthood, and to ad-minister in the ordinances of salva-tion to the children of men.It has been a very important dis-pensation, a very interesting gener-ation in which we live as Latter-day Saints. The history of this Church is before the world, and we are stillpassing through many interesting portions of the experience of the work of God in the last days.I will say to the Latter-day Saints, the Lord has fulfilled, so far, all that He has promised unto us. The Lord has called many menâ€”hun-dreds of themâ€”from the nations ofthe earth, who have received theHoly Priesthood, the authority by which the God of Israel has alwaysadministered in heaven and on theearth the ordinances of life and sal-vation. They have labored faith-fully until the present day; theyhave warned the inhabitants of theearth. All nations under heavenhave been visited by the Elders of Israel as far as the doors were opento receive them. The Lord, so far,has warned the world; He has, sofar, carried out the object of the calling of the sons of men. The Gos-pel has been preached and the chil-dren of men have heard it in everynation, including our own. Theyhave heard the testimony of these Elders of Israel. And what wasthe mission given to the Elders?To go forth and deliver the Gospelmessage to all the world. The peo-ple were called upon to repent oftheir sins, to have faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, and when they had faith in God, in the Gospel, faith to believe and receive those testimoniesgiven to them, they were called uponto go forth and be baptized for theremission of their sins. Then they had the privilege of receiving thelaying on of hands for the receptionof the Holy Ghost.These are some of the principles that have been taught from the time of Father Adam down to that of every Patriarch, Prophet, Apos-tleâ€”and even the Savior himselfâ€”in their day and generation, as theonly Gospel ever revealed to thehuman family in any age of the world. There has never been but one Gospel; that Gospel is "thesame today, yesterday and forever." [##Hebrews 13:8##]That Gospel is the same that wastaught by Adam to his children; which Elijah, Methuselah, and allthe ancient prophets and patriarchstaught to their posterity, and the in-habitants of the earth. Jesus Christ taught the same when He came in the meridian of time; He never de-viated from it in any instance. Paul the Apostle, born in due time, re-ceived the Gospel at the hands of the Lord, who said, though he oran angel from heaven preached anyother Gospel, let him be accursed. [##Galatians 1:8-9##]That Gospel was revealed to JosephSmith in all its fulness, pow-er and glory, with all its graces, gifts and principles. Hetaught it to those around him; he or-ganized this Church on the 6th day of April, 1830; and through all thetribulations, persecutions and trou-bles of the Latter-day Saints, that same Gospel has been among us.I feel thankful that I have livedso long, connected with this Church and Kingdom, and that I live now in the midst of the Latter-daySaints. As the Lord has set His hand to warn the world, to warnthis generation, to prune the vine-yard. He will leave every nation un-der heaven without excuse, in thesedays of judgments, calamities andtribulations, which are about to bepoured out upon the earth.I feel thankful that I have beenassociated with this people up to thepresent day. How long I shall re-main among the Latter-day Saints I do not know. It matters not with me; but I have the same testimony to bear today that I have had from the commencement of this Churchâ€”that it is the work of Godâ€”as prom-ised and prophesied of through themouths of inspired men for 6000years. I bear my testimony to these things this morning.I hope and trust that while we are assembled in this conferenceour hearts may be united in faith and prayer, that we may enjoy theHoly Spirit of God. Without theinspiration of that Spirit, Utah would be as barren a desert, as far as we are concerned, today as we found it on the 24th of July, 1847.When you heard the Gospel of Christ preached by those humblemen who had been called from theirvarious occupations, to go forth in the Lord's cause, inspired by the HolyGhost, without purse or scrip, tak-ing no thought what they should eat or what they should drink, youknew that what they taught was true. You heard and believed theirtestimony, and that same testimonyis here with this entire peopletoday. When you received the testimony you were baptized for theremission of your sins, you had hands laid upon you for the recep-tion of the Holy Ghost. Without all this you would have remained athome.I know that this is the work of God, and so do you; therefore let our hearts be thankful to God; let us unite together in our prayers to Him; let us do our duty faithfully while we dwell here in the flesh, and carry out those principles in which we have been taught. Letus continue to preach the Gospel, to warn the nations, to build up Zion,and establish righteousness; so thatwhen we get through and go on theother side of the vail we will be satisfied with our labors here. Weshould try, therefore, to live our re-ligion, to be true and faithful to ourcovenants, and to all those principlesof the Gospel of Jesus Christ whichwill save all men both in time andeternity.I pray to God my Heavenly Fatherthat His blessing may rest upon usâ€”upon these Elders of Israel, upon these Apostles of the Lamb of God, that they may be inspired to declare the words of salvation during this conference to their brethren andsisters, which may God grant, forChrist's sake, Amen. 
 President Wilford Woodruff.After a few prefatory observations,said he never wished to address anybody of people upon the Gospel ofChrist unless he could do so by theSpirit and inspiration of AlmightyGod; and that was his feeling thismorning.Those who were at Conference yes-terday listened to some very strongtestimonies presented by the Apostles.There was one discourse in particularto which he desired now to refer; thatof Brother Abraham H. Cannon, whoalluded to the views of certain per-sons as to the great mistakes whichhad been made in this world, some ofthem by people calling themselvesProphets, Apostles, and Saints of God.One of these alleged mistakes was inGod permitting Adam and Eve topartake of the forbidden fruit; anotherwas the mistake made in the Saviorbeing born in a stable and cradled in amanger, instead of his comingas a conqueror, as the leaderof the inhabitants of theearth; another was that the Apostlesand Prophets ceased to have revela-tions when Joseph Smith died. It wasto these principles that he wished torefer.When the Prophet Joseph wascalled of God to lay the foundation ofthis Church and kingdom he was amere boy. His first prayer to the Godof heaven was offered when he wasonly fourteen or fifteen years of age.He had read and studied the scripturespreviously and was anxious to knowwhat religious sect to join. An answer 
 THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS'MILLENIAL STAR."And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash awaythy sins, calling on the name of the Lord."â€”ACTS XXII: 16.No. 10 Vol. LVIII. Thursday, March 5, 1896. Price One Penny.DISCOURSE BY PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF.THE following discourse was delivered by President Wilford Woodruff, atthe Davis Stake Conference, in Farmington, September 7, 1895:How little we knew when we were born; how little we knew when wewere boys and girls; and when we arrived to manhood and the Spirit of God led us to have faith in the revelations of God, and not to join the sectarian world, still how little we knew what lay before us and the pur-poses of God concerning us. I can bear testimony to the truth of the discourse we listened to this forenoon. We live in a very important day and generation. We live in the midst of important works of God, and we little knew in early youth and manhood that we ourselves had been pre-served in the spirit world for seven thousand years, to stand in the fleshin the last days, to be called of God to labor in His vineyard and to buildup His Church. Nevertheless these are truths. The Lord has never set His hand in any age of the world to perform a work unless He has pre-pared an element to carry out that work. That is our condition as Latter-day Saints. In my youth I attended Sabbath school under Dr. Porter, agreat minister; but the very moment I began to read the Scriptures and learn what was in them, that very moment there was a spirit told me that that Church and Gospel that I read of in the New Testament were not on the earth. I never heard a minister acknowledge the necessity of the works that followed the teachings of the Savior and His Apostles. No-thing would make them angry quicker than to tell them that these werethe works of God and would be again established on the earth. The clergywould be immediately stirred up if they heard of any one advocating these thingsâ€”a thing which I frequently did in my early manhood. I felt that I could not join any church unless I could find one that taught those principles which I read of in the New Testamentâ€”a church that enjoyed

 548  THE DESERET WEEKLY.  WILFORD WOODRUFFand labor among ourselves. These temporal matters are a part of the labors that we have to per-form while we are here. Brethren,when we get on the other side of the veil and our eyes are opened, we will marvel over a great many things that we do not understand here; and agreat many things will there be un-derstood that cannot be here.One subject more I want to name,and that is with regard to our future. I will tell you what the Lord has re-vealed to me. You talk of revelation.I have a good many revelations. Weare not particularly required to writeall the revelations given to us. Joseph Smith wrote revelations in his day, and we have them to read, and they will all be fulfilled to the very letter.There has been a good deal said aboutthe rising generation of the Latter-Day Saints. I will tell you what will come to pass.My sons, the sons of my Counselors, the sons of these Apostles, and the sons ofthis people, will rise up by the power of God, and they will take this Kingdom and bear it off. You need make no mistake about this matter. They are the element that God has ordained, the same as Heordained us, to do His work. Our posterity will not forsake the Lord, nor their fathers, nor their mothers, nor the work in which they are engaged. Too many of them, it is true, have been led astray; too many of them havebeen found where they should not be; but the bulk of the sons of this people will remain true and faithfulto this work. There is no other element that the heavens look to but the rising generation of the Latter-day Saints, in connection with the Lamanites, andthey will be true and faithful. The Spirit of God will be with them, andthey will follow the footsteps of theirfathers, as their fathers follow Christ;and they will in their day and timestand-yes, brethren and sisters, oursons will stand in the flesh in the midst of these judgments of Almighty Godwhen it will require faith and power, even to commanding the elements to obey them, to live. These judgmentsare at the door.Brethren and sisters, many of us forget at times that we are here on a mission. When I was but a boy I read the New Testament, under old Dr.Porter and others, and I read aboutJesus Christ and His Apostles; that they had power to command the elements to obey them, power to command the sick and they were healed, and power to com-mand the dead and they were raised to life. "Oh," said I,"may I live to se a Prophet; may I liveto see an Apostle; may I live to see a man of God who will teach me these principles." The first sermon I heardpreached by a servant of God I em-braced the Gospel and was baptized. From that day to this I have not seen one moment when I have had any doubt with regard to the truth of this work. Whatever trials I have had, they have been of a different nature to that. I sayto our young men in Zion, arise and obey the commands of God. Go before the Lord and get the Holy Ghost, and open your eyes to the work that liesbefore you. Your fathers are passingaway and going to the other side of the veil, where we shall all go in our time.But the kingdom will rise, and God will sustain it, and it will never fall from this time till it is prepared as theBride, the Lamb's wife, for the coming of the Son of Man.I feel to bless the Latter-day Saints. We have got a noble class of men and women in the mountains of Israel. Nobetter men and women ever lived onthe earth. Read the history of theseRelief Societies, these ImprovementAssociations, these Primaries, and thelabors of our sisters in Israel. Theyhave been true and faithful all the way through, and they havebeen raised up, the same as the Elders of Israel have, to stand in the flesh and to magnify theircallings in their day and time. They are doing a great work, and God will bless them, and I bless them with every sentiment of my heart. I feel also to bless my brethren who bear theApostleship. Now, you talk about union. Can Apostles dwell with thiswork upon their shoulders without being united? They cannot do it. The sameSpirit bears record to each ofthem.Here are my Counselors and the Apostles, we are of one heart andmind, and when we have the Spirit of God there is nothing but that we seealike in. Here is Brother Snow, an aged man as well as myself, and the President of the Twelve Apostles; hehas got the spirit of his calling andoffice with him, and God is blessinghim. He is full of revelation, full ofthe Spirit of the Lord. We have amighty work upon us, and we want power in the midst of Israel to carryit out, and to do what the Lord requires of us; and we shall havepower to do it. I tell you I rejoice when I let my mind rest upon these temples of our God in these mountainsof Israel. Who ever heard of such athing in any generation?-a class of men driven from the society of theChristian world into the wilderness have power to gather together and rearthese temples unto the name of the Most High God, and go into these temples and to attend to the ordinancestherein. We hold and will hold thekeys of the salvation of our dead to the endless ages of eternity. As theProphet said, the Lord has raised up saviors upon Mount Zion, while thekingdom is the Lord's in the latterdays. The heavens are full of revela-tion. The earth is full of revelation.The Bible is full of revelation, as wellas these other books that we have;and we have revelation, and shouldhave day by day.I thank God that I am alive, andthat He has preserved me up to thishour. I have a good many times, andsome of them lately, come pretty neargoing to the other side of the veil; but I know that I have tens of thousands ofprayers of righteous men and women, which ascend into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth day by day; and when I say that of myself I say it of my Coun-selors, of these Apostles, and of the Elders of Israel. They have theprayers of the people. These prayersare heard and answered. The Lord has taken whom he would take, andhas preserved in life whom he would preserve, according to the counsels ofHis own will. We are appointed acertain work, and when we get through our sons will take it and bear it off. Zion will arise, and the glory of Godwill rest upon her; she will have powerin the earth, and the day is at handwhen, as Joseph Smith said, thou-sands of the great men of the earth will come to Zion to behold the glory thereof.God bless you, and pour out His Spiritupon you, and guide and direct youall.Remember your prayers. Bekind to one another. Do not find faultwith one another. We ought to becareful in speaking evil of one another.Bear one another up. Brethren andsisters, the glory of the whole matter is,that when we get through we are go-ing to have our families with us-ourfathers and our mothers, our brothersand our sisters, our wives and our children-in the morning of theresurrection, in the family organizationof the celestial world, to dwell foreverand forever. This is worth all you or I can sacrifice the few years we have to spend here in the flesh. God blessyou. Amen. 
 560 THE DESERET WEEKLY.work; but when He does call mento do His work they have to trustin Him.I marvel today, in my own mind,why I stand before you as the Presi-dent of the Church of Jesus Christof Latter-day Saints. I have beenassociated with some forty Apostlesin my day and time. Twenty-fourof themâ€”two quorumsâ€”are todayin the spirit world. There is aquorum of young men, many ofthem the sons of Apostles who havepassed away, with us today. Well,when I look at this and see that Iam still in the midst of Israel, andrealize that I have been called tothis position, I marvel at it. But itis the business of the Lord and notof man. It is not a position that Ihave sought. On the other hand,the eternal truth of this responsibil-ity stares me in the face. Iknow that I am responsible,for the position that I hold today, tothe God of heaven, who has chosenme, as are these apostles before meand these tens of thousands ofElders of Israel who now dwell inthe flesh on the earth. I attendeda Priesthood meeting here lastevening with quite a number ofthose bearing the Priesthood. Ilook upon the responsibility of thesepeople as being very great. Wehave been called upon in this dayto receive the Priesthood and to goforth and preach the Gospel of Je-sus Christ to this generationâ€”to theGentiles first, and then to the Houseof Israel. This has been my lot.It has been the lot of these Apostles,and many, yea thousands, of theleaders of the Latter-day Saints.We have been called upon to preachthe Gospel of Christ to this genera-tion and to warn them of the judg-ments which are to come.There has been a great deal saidat this conference. We have hadstrong testimonies borne by theElders of Israel who have addressedus. I remarked at the commence-ment of this conference (there werecomparatively few people here then)concerning our position and revela-tion. I remarked that Moses gaverevelations to Israel. We have theBibleâ€”the stick of Judahâ€”contain-ing the law of God through Mosesand through the ancient prophetsand patriarchs. [##Ezekiel 37:19##] It has been handeddown to us through the thousands ofyears that are past and gone. Whilelibraries, like the library of Alexan-dria (which was destroyed by anArab chief and took days and daysto burn, it being one of the largestever gathered together in the world)have perished, the Bible has beenpreserved unto us, and we have itto read. It gives unto us the law ofGod given to the ancients. Butthere has been no change in thatlaw, so far as the gospel is con-cerned, from that day until this.The Bibleâ€”the Old and the NewTestamentâ€”gives unto us the lawwhereby we may be exalted and goback again into the presence of Godand dwell with Him for ever andever. It gives unto us the coursewe should pursue in order to receivea part in the first resurrection, thatwe may come forth clothed withglory, immortality and eternal life.It also gives us the history, not onlyof what is passed with the Jews, butof what is to come to pass. Thenwe have a Book of Mormonâ€”thestick of Joseph in the hands ofEphraimâ€”that was written uponthis continent by apostles andprophets. It contains, among otherthings, the teachings of Jesus Christwhen he appeared, after his resur-rection, in his immortal and glori-ous body, and taught the gospelhere. Those revelations contain agreat many principles. They showunto us the final winding-up scene,the situation of great Babylon andthe judgments that were to come topass in the last days before the com-ing of the Son of Man. We havealso the Book of Doctrine and Cov-enants, which you have in yourhouses and which you canread. This code of revela-tion was given through themouth of the Prophet Joseph Smith,by the Urim and Thummim andotherwise. That book containssome of the most glorious and mostsublime revelations God ever gaveto man. It shows unto us what liesbefore us, what awaits this nationand the nations of the earth, andwhat is at the door of the inhabitantsof the earth. These things areclear, they are pointed, they arestrong, and they are the revelationsof God, and they will be fulfilled,whether men believe it or not.Now, with regard to present reve-lation. President Young led us agreat many years. He led us to thesevalleys. He was a man of God,filled with revelation. His teachingswere attended by the inspirations ofAlmighty God. He laid the foun-dation of the building of this wholeTerritory. He governed and con-trolled this Tabernacle we are in,the Temple we are building, andother Temples that we have builtin this Territory; and in all hiscounsels the word of the Lord waswith him. He had but few revela-tions that were written and pub-lished to the world. But we hadthe word of the Lord through him dayby day. The same with PresidentTaylor. We have already got, as Isaid before, this code of revelation,which we can read every day, andwhich is profitable for doctrine,for reproof, for correction, for in-struction, to guide us in the way oflife from day to day and from yearto year while we dwell in the flesh.When the Apostles and Elders ofIsrael are called to teach you, whenthey are called to go abroad and toteach the inhabitants of the earth,they are commanded of the Lord tospeak as they are moved upon bythe Holy Geost; and when a manspeaks as he is moved upon by theHoly Ghost, it is the word of theLord, it is the mind of the Lord, itis the will of the Lord, it is Scripture,it is the power of God unto salvationunto every one that believes. If wedo not have the Holy Ghost we haveno business to teach. But when theElders of Israel do teach you by theHoly Ghost, you have the revela-tions of God to you. We have theserevelations lying before us for ourguidance day by day, as well as theliving oracles.I would say to the President ofthe United States, to the Congressof the United States, to the Cabinet,and to all the inhabitants of thisland, as well as to all the na-tions of the earthâ€”kings, emperors,princes and peopleâ€”do not worryabout these Latter-day Saints. Iwould say to all nations underheaven, if these people are not thepeople of God, if this work has notbeen established by God Almighty,they will fall of themselves, theywill be swept from the face of theearth by the judgments of God,when Great Babylon falls. But ifthey are of God, what can you doabout it? What can the nations ofthe earth do about it? Have the na-tions forgotten that there is a God inIsrael? Have they forgotten thatthere is a God who created the hea-vens and the earth, and that He gov-erns and controls all these things? IfHe has set His hand to perform thiswork, there is no power on the faceof the earth, or in hell, that can de-stroy it, because Jehovah holds it inHis own hands. He holds our des-tiny and the destiny of all the worldin His hands. But the great diffi-culty with this nation and with allnations is, as it has been in everyage, they do not acknowledge thehand of God in any of these things.You see it in the history of thewhole world and in the dealingsof God with men and cities and na-tions, from the creation of the world.I have referred to these things be-fore in my remarks. Whenever anation is ripened in iniquity, theLord raises up prophets and inspiredmen and they are sent forth to warnthat nation, and when they havewarned the people and given untothem the word of the Lord, thatword will not fall unfulfilled. Wehave before us a great many instan-ces of the dealings of God with men.We have a fair example in Babylonthe Great. King Nebuchadnezzarsurrounded with the city walls a hun-dred feet high and wide enough forseveral chariots to ride abreast uponthe top thereof, with brazen gates andwith a power to defy all but Godhimself, what did he say: "Isnot this great Babylon, that I havebuilt for the house of the kingdomby the might of my power, and forthe honor of my majesty?" [##Daniel 4:30##] Theprophet might have told Neb-uchadnezzar that the God of heavenhad proclaimed a man before he wasborn that would come and take thatgreat city and destroy its ruler. Cyruswas named by the Lord before hewas born, through the mouth of theprophet; [##Isaiah 44:28##] and when the time came,as King Belshazzar and his princeswere feasting and drinking wineout of the cups that had beenbrought from the temple at Jerusa-lem, he took possession of the cityand carried off the treasures. [##Daniel 5:1-4##] Thearmy of Cyrus turned the river outof its course and walked in underthe walls of the city. Belshazzarwas taken prisoner and slain, andthe city went into the hands ofpeople they were not looking for. [##Daniel 5:30-31##]What did Cyrus do when he tookthe city of Babylon? He took therichesâ€”cattle, horses and propertyâ€”there was in that city and offeredthem as a sacrifice to the great God.This is the course that a heathenking took; and we understand, from 
 Wm CriddleOct. 10 [18]95 
 came to him from the Lord thereon.The heavens were opened; God theFather and God the Son appeared tohim, and the Father said,"This is My beloved Son;hear ye Him." The history of JosephSmith from that time until he organ-ized the Church of Jesus Christ ofLatter-day Saints, on the 6th of April,1830, was a constant scene of revela-tion and visitation. His counselorswere the angelsâ€”those who held thePriesthood in the flesh while on theearth and administered upon this con-tinent to the sons of Adam, to thechildren of Israel who dwelt here.They were his teachers and continuedto be so until he was called toorganize this Church and Kingdomupon the foundation laid by the an-cient apostles and prophets, "JesusChrist himself being the chief cornerstone."The speaker said he would like toask that assembly of Latter-day Saints,what power would the Prophets of Godin those early days have had to or-ganize and build up the Church ofChrist upon earth unless they hadbeen taught either by the angels ofGod or the Lord Himself? There wasno other way; and every step that theProphet Joseph took, up to the veryday of his death, was a proof of this.Any man or woman who read theBook of Doctrine and Covenants wouldfind there a code of the most sublimerevelations ever given by God to man-kind. True, Joseph Smith was illiter-ate, in a measure, so far as learningwas concerned; but those who had readthose revelations could see that no ig-norant boy, without inspiration,could have prepared such acode. It required revelation al-most every day. When this codeof revelations was given, afterthe Church was organized, withProphets, Apostles, Seventies, HighPriests, High Councilors, Elders andTeachers, it was not particularlynecessary while those revelations werebefore the people that the Lord shouldgive special written revelation toPresident Young, though the latterhad revelations. He had the powerand Spirit of God with him; it was aliving witness day by day to guide anddirect him in all the works which hehad to perform here in the flesh. Whathe accomplished had shown this. He(the speaker) wanted to make these re-marks because he did not know to whatextent the minds and feelings of theLatter-day Saints might be led in thesechannels.The God of heaven had not forsakenthe Presidency of this Church. Hehad not closed the heavens againstthem nor those associated with them.His Spirit and power were with thispeople, and would never be withdrawnfrom them up to the time of the comingof the Son of Man.President Woodruff next adverted tosome of the early missionaries of theChurch, including Orson Pratt, ParleyPratt and Orson Hyde, who were or-dained Elders and sent forth to workin the Lord's vineyard and to warnthe world. They held the Priesthood,they had authority to preach the Gos-pel of Christ to the children of men.He asked the congregation, had notJesus Christ, the Son of the living God,backed up the testimony which hadbeen borne by these men and scores ofother missionaries since their day?Where would Utah and its inhabi-tants have been today but foh Latter-ter-day Saints? It would have beena barren desert, just as they found iton the 24th of April [July], 1847.Turning to the subject of the Priest-hood, the speaker remarked that theycould trace the history of Israel, thedealings of God with men, from thetime of Father Adam down.Not an iota of evidence couldbe adduced proving that a manever went forth, called of God, and suc-cessfully preached the Gospel of Christwithout he bore the Holy Priesthood.The Lord had chosen the weak thingsof the earth to confound the wise.This had been the nature of His deal-ings with men in every age, and thusit was that humble men had beencalled in this last dispensation of thefullness of times to go forth and warnthe generations in the midst of whichwe stood today.Great responsibilities rested upon theshoulders of all Latter-day Saints, andthe leaders of Israel would be held re-sponsible before high heaven in theday of judgment for the manner inwhich they exercised their Priesthood.He advised the Saints to read section121 Doctrine and Covenants, relatingto the Lord's answer to the ProphetProphet Joseph's prayer. This was,he said, one of the mightiest revela-tions that God had ever given to man,and it had been fulfilled. The Lordhad said, "Many are called but feware chosen." Why was this? Be-cause their hearts were set so muchupon the things of this world. Therights of the Priesthood were insepar-ably connected with the heavens, andthe heavens could be controled only onthe principles of righteousness. Thepeople would understand this. TheLord would not withdraw himself fromthis work, for He had set His hand tofulfil the promised made through themouths of inspired men.Some of the brethren on the previousday bore testimony that this Churchwas the work of God. They certainlywould not be qualified to preachthe Gospel and undertake tobuild up Zion if they did notknow this. And how did they knowit? By the revelations of Jesus Christ,by the inspiration of Almighty God,that Spirit which belonged to everyman who was faithful to his covenants.The testimony that we had in our daya[n]d generation was the same as wasgiven in every age of the world.Speaking next of the gifts and graceswhich had attended this Church andthose who labored in it both at homeand abroad, President Woodruff saidhe did not refer to this in any merespirit of boasting. No member of thisChurch could undertake to preachto the people unless movedupon by the inspiration of God.What man was there that everarose to speak on the stand whoknew before hand what he was goingto say? If anyone else did, certainlyhe himself did not. These principleswere before them, and they knew themto be true. He prayed to God hisHeavenly Father that their hearts mightbe united. He could say for himselfthat if the inspiration of the HolySpirit had not been with him, he wouldhave been in his grave years ago, andhundreds more with him. If the Lordhad not been with him in his travelsmany a time he would have been lost.President Woodruff in this connection,mentioned a remarkable incident. Onone occasion he said he was in chargeof a company of Saints numbering up-wards of one hundred. They had en-gaged passage on a steamboat at Pitts-burg; but the Spirit of God said to him,"Do not go," and but for that the en-tire company would doubtless havebeen lost. They did not go, but wentby another boat. The one by whichthey were to have gone took fire atnight some five miles down the riverand all on board were lost either byfire or water. So the Spirit of God hadbeen with them all through this work.It was the duty of all to pray, andone of the requests which he had tomake of the Latter-day Saints was tobe a prayerful people. They did notpray enough. They should go beforethe Lord in their secret place and pleadwith Him to guide and direct them inall the affairs of this transitory life.When the prayers of 100,000 Latter-day Saints reached the Lord theywere always heard and answered.The Lord would build up Zion. Hewould establish His work andgather Israel together. They had towarn the world, so that all would beleft without excuse in the day ofjudgment. The earth was heavilyburdened with the sins of its inhabit-ants, and they were even increasing,causing pain and affliction on everyhand. But before the judgments camethe Lord had raised up men to warn theworld, and he prayed that those warn-ings would not be without effect.

 THE DESERET WEEKLY. 561history, that Cyrus pursued thiscourse all his life. Whenever hetook a city he went and offeredsacrifice to the great God, the Godof heaven. You may trace thisthrough the whole history of theworld until the present hourand you will find that thatGod who sits enthroned onhigh has governed and controlledall these things. He will do thesame today. That same God hasset His hand to fulfill the volume ofrevelations contained in these rec-ords of divine truth, which portraythe winding-up scene of the workand Kingdom of God in the lastdispensation and fulness of times.Our Heavenly Father called Hisservant Joseph Smith. He laid thefoundation of this Church andKingdom, and he organized theChurch with prophets, apostles,pastors, teachers, gifts and graces,for the perfecting of the Saints, forthe work of the ministry, and for theedifying of the body of Christ, untilwe all come to the perfect stature ofa man in Christ Jesus, in fulfillmentof the revelations of God. Our num-bers are few, it is true; but the peo-ple of God always were few in everyage of the world. Noah, afterpreaching 120 years, while buildingthe ark, only succeeded in savingeight souls out of all the inhabitantsof the earth. [##Genesis 6-7##] The rest were destroyedby the flood, and they were shut upin prison and there visited by JesusChrist, the Son of the living God. While his body lay in the tomb threedays His spirit went to preachto those spirits that were in prison,that they might be judged accord-ing to men in the flesh. [##1 Peter 3:19-20##] The workof the Lord always has been an up-hill business so far as laboring amongthe children of men is concerned.But there is no person who believesin the Bible can deny that the Lordhas proclaimed that in the latterdays He would set His hand to buildup His Church and Kingdom, Hewould gather together His people,and He would send an angel flyingthrough the midst of heaven, havingthe everlasting Gospel to preach un-to every nation, kindred, tongueand people under the whole heav-ens, crying with a loud voice: "FearGod and give glory to Him; for thehour of His judgment is come."This was the proclamation of theangel of God who delivered the Gos-pel of Christ to Joseph Smith. "Thehour of His judgment is come." [##Joseph Smith-History 1:44-45##] Sosay we. We have been called uponto warn the nations. We have beencalled to go forth without purse orscrip. We have had to travel abroad,swim rivers, wade swamps, travelon foot, and visit the nations of theearth in various ways, to preach theGospel unto them. We have beenobliged to do this, for we have beencalled to do it, whether we werepopular or unpopular. If we hadnot done this, we would have beencondemned; the Lord would havecut us off and raised up a people thatwould perform His work. Thesethousands of Elders, gathered outfrom the nations of the earth, uponwhose shoulders rests this Priest-hood, are the instruments in thehands of Almighty God, andare called to go forth to warnthis generation; and their testimonywill rise up in judgment against thisgeneration and condemn them, and Ideclare it in the name of Jesus Christ,as an Apostle of the Lamb of God inthis day and age of the world. Isay there is not a nation under hea-ven, there is not a king, a prince ora president, or any other man whohas power over the sons of men, butshould give unto their subjects theprivilege of worshiping God accord-ing to the dictates of their own con-sciences. These subjects are thecreatures of God, they are the chil-dren of God. They are placed hereon the earth and are responsible toGod Himself for their religion, fortheir faith and for their worship.They are not responsible to the em-perors, or kings, or presidents, orgovernors who rule over them.Every man is responsible for thecourse he pursues before the Lord.And God will bless no king, no em-peror and no president who will notgive unto his subjects the rights andprivileges in their relationship toGod which the Father Himself hasgiven unto them. Whenever thesesubjects are deprived of their rights,those who preside over them areheld responsible.We are here upon a mission. Thisis not our home. This is not theplace where we expect to dwell for-ever. We are going into the spiritworld. I have been associated withthe Church for 57 years. Iwas intimate with the ProphetJoseph Smith and those that laidthe foundation of this Church, whowere martyred for the word ofGod and testimony of Jesus. Theytoday are in the spirit world, ming-ling with the Gods, where they canplead for their brethren. So tooshall we go in our day and time.In view of this can I afford to rejectthe gospel, or to turn away fromthat which the Lord has requiredat my hands, because it does notsuit the world? I cannot. I havegot to meet my acts before thethrone of God, and so have thisnation and all the inhabitants of [t]heearth. They will understand thenthat there is a power above them, andthat is the God of heaven. Allmen have got to appear at thejudgment seat of Christ. And whenmen shed the blood of the righteousbecause they follow the words of theLord, they have to pay for it.No man can shed the blood of therighteous without it costing himsomething. It was so in the daysof Jesus Christ. No man was moreunpopular on the face of the earththen Jesus Christ was from theday He was born until He ascendedinto heaven. All Jerusalem wasagainst Him. The Jews wereagainst Him. The Gentiles wereagainst Him, in a great measure.They cried out against Him andaccused Him of everything that waswrong, and labored very hard tofind some accusation against Himwhereby they might put Him todeath. It is true that the Gentile judgewho heard the testimony againstJesus told the Jews: "I find no faultin this man," and he washed hishands, saying, "I am innocent ofthe blood of this just person: see youto it." All right, said they, "hisblood be on us, and on our child-ren." [##Matthew 27:22-25##] How little did those Jewsknow what it would cost them toshed the blood of Jesus Christ.Well might the Son of God, whileon the cross, cry out, "Father, for-give them; for they know not whatthey do." [##Luke 23:34##] Strange language for aman that was expiring on the cross!Why did He say this? He knewwhat would be the result to theJewish nation for the next twothousand years. Whenever the na-tions of the earth have taken astand against the Gospel of Christor the people of God, they have hadto pay the bill. It has cost some-thing to shed the blood of JosephSmith and Hyrum Smith, and theprice is not fully paid yet.While the world look upon us asa strange people, while they haveno faith in us or in our teachings,and while they have no faith inthe Bible which they profess to be-lieve in, still their unbelief willnot make the truths of God withouteffect. The inhabitants of the earthknow not what awaits them. TheLord is going to cut short His workin righteousness. If He did not noflesh would be saved. As I havesaid before, we have been calledupon to warn this generation.How was it when we firstwent to New York, to Phila-delphia, to Boston, and to thevarious states of the Union? Wewent there and found hundreds ofpeople who were ready to receivethe Gospel of Christ. We organizedchurches throughout the UnitedStates, north and south, more espe-cially in the northern and middlestates. At that time there was notthe feeling that there is today. Therewere a great many who were willingto open their eyes to see, their earsto hear, and their hearts to under-stand. The Lord told Joseph Smiththat He had set His hand to pruneHis vineyard once more for the lasttime, and He commanded him andothers to go forth and warn thisgeneration to gather out the honestand meek of the earth, and to pre-pare for the day of His judgment.And in one place in this book of##Doctrine and Covenants 86:1-7|Doctrine and Covenants##, in explain-ing the parable of the wheat and thetares, the Lord says: "Behold, verilyI say, that the field was the world,and the Apostles were the sowers ofthe seed; and after they have fallenasleep, the great persecutor of thechurch, the apostate, the whore,even Babylon, that maketh all na-tions to drink of her cup, in whosehearts the enemy, even Satan, sit-teth to reign, behold he soweth thetares, wherefore the tares choke thewheat and drive the church into thewilderness. But behold, in the lastdays, even now while the Lord isbeginning to bring forth the word,and the blade is springing up and isyet tender. Behold, verily I sayunto you, the angels are crying un-to the Lord day and night, who areready and waiting to be sent forthto reap down the fields; but the Lordsaid unto them, pluck not up thetares while the blade is yet tender(for verily your faith is weak) lestyou destroy the wheat also."Do the inhabitants of the earth re-alize the judgments that hang over 
 the same gifts and blessings that the Savior and His Apostles possessed.  That was not alone my condition, but it was the condition of many men who lived in those days. As I have said, God had an element prepared, who had been ordained of Him to stand in the flesh in the commencement of His Church on the earth in this dispensation, and this element the Lord has gathered together in order to build up Zion, to warn the world, and to prepare for the coming of the Son of Man. Brother George Q. Cannonspoke this forenoon on the subject of revelation. When the Church wasorganized nobody professed to have revelation; it was not believed in.  They had the Bible, and they did not want any more revelation. But I will say to ye men of Israel, the Lord never had a church in any age of the world that He did not give revelation to, and never will have. This Church could not live twenty-four hours without revelation. It belongs to the Priesthood and to the Gospel of Christ.Brother Cannon spoke about the temptation of the evil one. There never was a people on the earth whom the devil was more anxious to tempt and to destroy than those who bear the Holy Priesthood. If any-body supposes that the First Presidency and the Apostles and leadingmen of Israel are not tempted, they are mistaken. If Jesus Christ was tempted of the devil for forty days and nights, do you suppose he would pass by these apostles and prophets? We are all of us tempted and tried day by day. There is no people that the arch enemy, Lucifer, is more at war against than these Latter-day Saints dwelling in the valleys of the mountains. We all have to fight against this power, and shall have to until He comes whose right it is to reign, with the keys of death and hell,and binds Satan and sets a seal upon him. In my reflections sometimes I feel that the Latter-day Saints do not comprehend our position, and the danger we are in through being continually tempted and tried; for there is a power constantly laboring with us to draw us away from our dutiesand from the commandments of the Lord. The God of heaven holds me responsible as the President of this Church, holding the keys of the Gospel of Christ, while I dwell in the flesh. Can I live without revelation? Can my counselors and these Apostles live without revelation? They would not be fit to lead this Church one day without the revelations of God. I am somewhat acquainted with the Lord; I am somewhat acquainted with His ways and with His Spirit; and I know that God Himself, His Son Jesus Christ, and all the powers of the eternal and everlasting Priesthood are exer-cised over carrying out the great purposes of God upon the earth. These revelations in the Bible, the Book of Mormon, and the Book of Doctrineand Covenants have got to be fulfilled, and without we yield ourselves as Elders of Israel to this work we do not magnify our calling before the Lord. We have revealed to us in the Bible the promises that were made to Joseph, who was separated from his brethren, and to Ephraim and Manasseh. Their blessings were to prevail to the utmost bounds of the everlasting hills. [##Genesis 49:26##] We to-day are in that very country. We have been led here by the power of God, and that, too, by men who were governed and controlled by revelation. Now, if there is anything on earth the devil wants, it is to hedge up the way for the fulfilment of these revelations

They do not, no morethan t[h]e people did in the days ofNoah, in the days of Lot, and in thedays of the Jews when they put todeath the Messiah.You have embraced the Gospel.How came you to be gathered herein these valleys of the mountains,in this once barren desert? Wheredid you come from? You camefrom England, from Norway, fromSweden, from the various nations ofthe earth and from the isles of thesea. How was it that you camehere? You reply: An Elder ofIsrael called. I heard him preach.He told me if I would repent of mysins, I should receive the gift of theHoly Ghost. I believed him. Iwent forth and was baptized. I hadhands laid upon me for the receptionof the Holy Ghost, and I did receivethe Holy Ghost. There was no de-ception about this. I was movedupon to gather with the Saints ofGod to the mountains of Israel, thatI might stand with them and betaught in the things of the Kingdomof God, that I might stand in holyplaces while the judgments of Godwere poured forth in the earth.That is why you are here. Wemight have preached to you till wehad been as old as Methuselah, andif the Almighty had not backed upthe testimony of these Elders ofIsrael, Utah today would be as bar-ren a desert as we found it as far asthe Latter-day Saints are con-cerned.This is the work of Gok, and weare called upon to labor, no matterwhat may appear around us, or whatpersecutions we may be called uponto pass through. This is the greatlast Kingdom of our God that Danielsaw. [##Daniel 2:26-47##] It is the Zion of God thatIsaiah saw. [##Isaiah 60##] It is the Church ofJesus Christ that the RevelatorJohn saw.  [##Revelation 14##] The angel of God hascome and delivered his message, infulfillment of the commandmentsof God, and the cry has been, Pre-pare ye for the coming of the Son ofman; behold the day of God's judg-ment is come. This is the procla-mation to the whole world todayâ€”Jew and Gentile. And this is whywe are here. We have been ledhere by the inspiration and power ofGod, and we have come here to ful-fill the volume of the book of therevelations of God to the inhabitantsof the earth. Therefore, I say, let notyour hearts be troubled. It is yourFather's good pleasure to give youthe Kingdom. These Latter-daySaints are where they should beâ€”where the Lord has called them;and if we do our duty, if weunite together and keep thecommandments of God, all willbe well in Zion. The Lord hassaid: "Verily I say unto you, thatI, the Lord, will contend with Zion,and plead with her strong ones, andchasten her until she overcomes andis clean before me; for she shall notbe removed out of her place. I, theLord, have spoken it." [##Doctrine and Covenants 90:36-37##] We havegot to do right and keep the com-mandments of God. If we don't,we shall be chastened, there is nodoubt about that. But while theworld are looking for the destructionof this Church, they will look invain. They do not realize that thejudgments of God are being pro-claimed by sword and by fire, andthat the Lord is pleading with allflesh. The sword is bathed inheaven; it will fall upon Idumeaand the world, and who is able tostand the judgments of the Al-mighty? [##Isaiah 34:5##] Those who are strivingfor our overthrow, if they have notfaith today in this and in God, theywill have faith whenever they cometo judgment; for the whole ofthem have got to go to judgment,and they will be judged accordingto their deeds done in the body.Brethren and sisters, let us lookat these things as they are. We areunder great responsibility. In everydispensation God has called men andplaced them as watchmen on thewalls of Zion. He told Ezekiel: "Ihave set thee a watchman un-to the house of Israel; there-fore thou shalt hear the word atmy mouth, and warn them fromme. When I say unto the wicked,O wicked man, thou shalt surelydie; if thou dost not speak to warnthe wicked from his way, thatwicked man shall die in his iniqui-ty; but his blood will I require atthine hand. Nevertheless, if thouwarn the wicked of his way to turnaway from it; if he do not turn fromhis way, he shall die in his in-iquity, but thou hast delivered thysoul." [##Ezekiel 33:7-9##] We have been called uponto warn this generation. We havetried to do it in our weak way. Ihave for the last fifty-seven years ofmy life. So have these brethrenhere. We have traveled thousandsof miles without purse or scrip. Wehave lifted up our voices andpreached the Gospel of Christ to thisdispensation.We are also called, brethren andsisters, to perform some work in ourday and time that no other dispen-sation of men have been called todo. We have been called to reartemples and to go into those templesand redeem our dead. It takes asmuch to save a dead man as it doesa living one. If the dead have notheard the Gospel, the Lord is notgoing to send them to hell becausethey have not received it. TheLord is the Father of all. He ismerciful to all, and He will save all,except the sons of perdition. Everyman will have a glory. Our "Lib-eral" friends here will have a glory.A man will have a celestial gloryif he abides the law of the celestialkingdom; he will have a terrestrialglory if he abides the law of theterrestrial kingdom; he will have atelestial glory if he abides the law ofthe telestial kingdom. That is thelaw of God unto us.Brethren and sisters, I have de-sired to know the truth from theday I was a child. I read the Biblein my boyhood. I attended Sabbathschool under old Dr. Porter and Dr.Haws. I read in this New Testa-ment about Jesus Christ. I read ofwhat kind of a Gospel He preachedand what kind of a man He was. Iread about the Apostles and of thepower they had; how they laid handsupon the sick and they recovered;they could cast out devils, and, insome instances, raised the dead. Inmy boyhood I longed that I mightlive on the earth till I could find aservant of God, an inspired man,who would teach me these princi-ples that I read of in the New Testa-ment. The Lord promised me, infulfillment of my prayers, that Ishould live to see that day. I havelived to see it. The Lord has calleda people from the nations of theearth, from every sect, party anddenomination, to receive the fulnessof the everlasting Gospel. There isbut one Gospel. There never was butone Gospel; there never will be butone. Millions of people have beenborn in the flesh, have lived and havegone to the grave, who never saw theface of a prophet in their lives; neversaw a man that was called of God andhad power to administer in one of theordinances of the House of God.Will God condemn them becausethey did not receive the Gospel?Not at all. They are in the spiritworldâ€”our fathers. We are calledupon, as saviors on Mount Zion,while the Kingdom is the Lord's, inthe latter-days, to go forth and re-deem our dead. We hold in ourhands the keys and power of theirredemption, by attending to the ordi-nances of God for them. It is a workthat the Lord has blessed us with.I thank God for this privilege. It isone of the blessings that the Latter-day Saints enjoy. When I go intothe spirit world I expect to meet myfathers, my mothers, my relatives.I have been in the Temple of theLord. I have received endowmentsfor over three thousand of them onmy father's and my mother's side,all that I could get access to. I donot want to go into the spirit worldto meet these people and have themsay to me, "You had power to enterinto these Temples to get redemptionfor me, but you have not done it."Lay these things to heart. Be notafraid with regard to the work; onlyserve God and trust in Him. Youcannot serve man, nor make fleshyour arm, for your salvation. If weare saved, if we are delivered, if wehave redemption, it will be by thepower of the God of Israel. Hesent His Son into the world to laydown His life for the redemption ofthe children of men.I feel to thank God that I havethis privilege of bearing my testi-mony to the work. I know it istrue. I know Joseph Smith wasone of the greatest prophets thatGod ever raised up in the earth,save Jesus Christ. Joseph Smithholds the keys of this great and lastdispensation and fulness of times;he will hold those keys to the end-less ages of eternity. He sealed histestimony with his blood. And ifwe have to do the same, what of it?Thousands and thousands of thechildren of men laid down theirlives in going to war, for the sake ofworldly honor. Is it any more fora man to lay down his life for thegospel's sake than it is for him tolay it down for some other cause?I say no. It makes no differencewhat we are called to pass through,if we are united and do our duty allwill be well. I want salvation whenI get through. I want to go wheremy Heavenly Father and the Saviorare, if I can. I want to go wherethe Apostles and Prophets are whohave borne the heat and burden of 
 than I can, so have not madeas much preparation as I wouldhave done, and as I am a poor manwill need help.I have just been called to a 2years mission in the Sabbath School of the Ward. But if you see fitto extend the time a little so Ican prepare and let me know whatpart of the Northern States youwish me to go I can better tell how much means I will need totake me to my field of Labor.Your Brother in the GospelWm H.

 and prophecies. It is in the hands of this people to carry out these purposes of God as revealed unto us. Will we do it? Yes, we will do it.  Why? Because the Lord's word will always be fulfilled. All that has been said with regard to gathering the people to Zion and what was to transpire in Zion has been fulfilled so far, and not one word will fail. I want the Latter-day Saints to understand this. You are here upon a mission. So am I. So was Joseph Smith. Every one that has been born into this Church had the privilege of coming here and receiving the bless-ings of this Church and of the temples of our God. If we do not receive them, it is our fault, and not the Lord's.I have been strongly exercised in my mind in looking at the signs of thetimes and what is taking place in the earth. I think of what the Savior said to the Pharisees:  "Ye can discern the face of the sky; but can ye not discern the signs of the times?" So I feel to say to the Latter-daySaints, Can we not discern the signs of the times? When I look at the wickedness of men and the terrible power the devil has among the children of men I feel as though it should stir us up to righteousness and to the work of the Lord. I have referred to the fact that I was twenty years of age before there was a murder committed in the New England States. A man killed his wife in New Haven, Connecticut, and it shocked all New England. Old men and women and young men and maidens wept over the idea of a murder being committed in the New England States. How is it to-day? It takes columns of every newspaper published to record the murders and suicides that are committed each twenty fours hours. People are killing themselves to pay their debts, or for some other reason. And this is increasing all the time. Now, my brethren and sisters, this terrible rush to death that is in the world means something. What is the meaning of it all? Why, the Lord said to Joseph Smith sixty-three years ago:Behold verily I say unto you, the angels are crying unto the Lord day and night, who are ready and waiting to be sent forth to reap down the fields;But the Lord saith unto them, pluck not up the tares while the blade is yet tender, (for verily your faith is weak,) lest you destroy the wheat also.Therefore let the wheat and tares grow together till the harvest is fullyripe, then ye shall first gather out the wheat from among the tares, and after the gathering of the wheat, behold and lo! the tares are bound in bundles, and the field remaineth to be burned.Do the Latter-day Saints comprehend this? Think of the great changesthat are taking place in the world; of this dreadful loss of life, and also of virtue; of the terrible cyclones, laying waste whole cities; fires devas-tating towns and villages; earthquakes, storms, and judgments of every kind. What is the meaning of all this? Why, these messengers that have been waiting in heaven for a long time, holding in their hands the sharp sickles, have gone forth in the earth and made a beginning, and they never will cease until this scene is wound up. If you want to know what is coming to pass in the earth, read the revelations of St. John as well as those in the Book of Mormon and Book of Doctrine and Coven-ants. Satan is busy. He knows that his power will be curtailed unless

 THE DESERET WEEKLY. 563the day in their generationsâ€”Moses,Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Danieland all the Prophets and Patriarchswhose testimonies we have in theBible, as well as those who dwelt inthis land.I bear my testimony that this isthe Kingdom of God. As to perse-cution, all men who live godlyin Christ Jesus suffer persecu-tion. Why this combinationby priest and people against JosephSmith, an illiterate boy, as soon ashe was administered to by the an-gels of God? Why did he wade indeep waters up to the day of hisdeath? Why did he pass throughforty or fifty vexatious lawsuits?Because he was a servant of Godand warned the inhabitants of theearth of the judgments that were tocome. So it has been with all whohave followed him. If this peoplewere not the people of God, youwould not see a combination of theinhabitants of the earth for our des-truction. Are these Latter-daySaints all the sinners there are inthe world? If they are, I tell youthe inhabitants of the earth are in agood condition. But it is not so.We sin enough, it is true; perhapstoo much; we are guilty of a goodmany things, probably, that weought to repent of; I have no doubtthere should be a reformation amongus in some things; we do not pray asmuch as we ought to; but we arenot so bad as the world call us byany means. The Presidency, theApostles and these Elders of Israel,our hearts should be united together.We should labor with each other,and for each other, and for thebenefit of the children of God.We have tried to do that, ina measure, I believe; but weare weak. If, however, we willdo our duty, all will be well.I pray God to bless these Latter-day Saints. I know He will blessus if we walk uprightly before Him.We will conquer, we will overcome,Zion will arise and flourish, it willstand as appointed of the Lord, thesaints of God will be gathered, theywill stand in holy places while thejudgments of God are manifest inthe earth. I say to the Latter-daySaints and to the world, watch thesigns of the times, watch the changsthat are going to take place. I tellyou that thunders, that lightnings,that earthquakes, that storms, thatcyclones, that pestilence and thatfamine are gathered together in theheaven of heavens, and the angelsof God are ready to go forth whenthe testimony of the elders of Israelis closed. Messengers will visit theearth that they cannot mob, thatthey cannot destroy, because theyare the angels of God. These areeternal truths, written like pagesof living fire upon these records ofAlmighty God, and they will havetheir fulfillment. Prepare your-selves for the things that await us.They are sure to come. No powercan stay the hand of the Almighty.God bless us and give us inspiration,light and truth, that we may be pre-pared for that which is to come, forChrist's sake. Amen.

 he can stop the progress of the work of God, and he is laboring all the time to try and draw away the sons and daughters of Zion from the path of rectitude and duty. Whenever half a dozen Elders gather together to preach the Gospel, there you will find the enemy working hard against them.Brother Cannon also spoke about the First Presidency of the Church.  Now, the world is terribly afraid that the Presidency of this Church shall say something to somebody about politics; and even some of the Elders of Israel appear very much afraid that they will get some counsel on these things. What are they thinking about? Politics should never turn the heart of any man bearing the Holy Priesthood from his brethren or from the cause of God. Let him enjoy his politics, and vote for whom he chooses; but let all men stop throwing this filth and slime and pursuing a course wherein God Himself and the angels are ashamed of them. It makes no difference to me what a mans politics is; he has a right to enjoy his own political ideas; but let this people realize that they are Latter-day Saints and are held responsible before God for the course they pursue.We should look at these things as they are. We hold in our hands thekeys of the kingdom, and God will hold us responsible for the use we make of this power which He has entrusted to us. If we do our duty, we shall prevail. We have revelation with us. True, the leaders of this Church since the death of the Prophet Joseph Smith have not written many revel-ations. Joseph Smith brought forth the Book of Doctrine and Covenants, and it is a grand volume of revelationâ€”one of the most glorious records ever given of God to man on the earth. But I want to say that Brother Brigham Young did not live without revelation. He always had revel-ation with him. He could not labor without it; he could not preach or do the will of God without it. Nor can any man that occupies that position.  The Lord would permit no man to stand at the head of this Church unless he was governed and controlled by revelation. We are feeble instrumentsâ€”weak worms of the dust; but God has chosen the weak things of the earth to confound the wise, and to build up His Zion, and He gives us revelation and makes known unto us His mind and will. We have a great labor upon us at the present time in carrying out the purposes of the Lord with regard to His work among the sons and daughters of Adam. I rejoice that I have lived to see what I have seen. I rejoice that I came to these valleys with President Young. We found a barren desert. What did the Spirit of God say to him? He was urged not to stop here, but go on to Cali-fornia. "No," said Brother Young, "I am going to stay right here. I am going to build a city here; I am going to build a temple here; I am going to build a country here." What did he say that by? By the power of revel-ation, and he fulfilled it all. He performed a great work. He laid the foundations of this great and glorious temple here, and we have lived to dedicate it unto God. We have power to-day to go into four temples and attend to the ordinances of the house of God for the living and for the dead. Yes, we are opening the prison doors in the spirit world to thou-sands and thousands of our fathers' households. Thus we are saviors upon Mount Zion, whom the Lord has raised up in these last days to redeem the

I feel it to be my dutyto state the circumstances that I find myself surroun-ded by.  My wife was called from me by the summonsof death, leaving her children to my care and that ofmy daughter.  I have striven hard with a sad heartto keep them with me, that I might teach them insuch a manner, that the faith of the gospel may beplanted in them, and that they may honor their faith-^ful^ and noble mother, and become useful in the Kingdomof God. By the wisdom and strength given me bymy Heavenly Father, I feel that I have been thus far,very successful. Three of them are quite small, andwould be left without a father or mother's care in myabsence. My means are very limited, and my sonCharles is very anxious for the time to come, that hemay obey the call made upon him last fall, andgo on his mission. He will be ready to start in June 
 April 9 THE DESERET NEWS. 181PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFFSaid this was the fifty-fourth anniver-sary of the establishment of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He considered the human voice a poor medium to convey the im-pressions upon the soul of man. Itwas a matter of impossibility in thefew moments he had to stand beforethe people to ezpress his reflectionsupon the things of God and the dutiesof the Saints. There was a vast amount of subjects of great interest tous as a people. He endorsed the senti-ments advanced on the subject of homeindustries. He wished to say a few words on the conflict between truth and error, light and darkness. We were in the midst of it and so were the servants of God from the beginning. It would be so down to the end of time. This warfare commenced in heaven. One third of the host of heaven rebel-led against God and His Christ while the two-thirds kept their first estate.This made a tremendous number of fallen spirits who were cast down to the earth, without bodies, constituting those evil ones who tempted those who had bodies to do evil. Whenever there were men on earth who labored to es-tablish righteousness and introduce acelestial law, these spirits workedagainst them and influenced the ma-jority of mankind to reject the ser-vants of God. It cost the servants of God their lives. It cost Joseph Smithhis life. This warfare would continue. These evil spirits would war againstthe Saints, against God, against Christ, against His work until the time camewhen Satan and his hosts should bebound for a thousand years. But we had the promises of the Lord for our encouragement that this work should stand. God had decreed that He would establish His work in the dispensationof the fulness of times never to be castdown. There was no higher calling onthe face of the earth than to become a witness for the Lord Jesus Christ. Theday had dawned when the God of hea-ven had stretched out His hand to re-store Judah and Israel, and set up His dominion. Our business was to laborfor this cause. It had come here tostay. Though the Prophet and Patri-arch were martyred, and this peoplehad been driven, the progress of this work had not been and could not bestayed. The God of heaven required us to warn this generation, who wereapproaching a very important day andtime. A class of beings would followthe Elders in their testimonies to theworld, beings who would command thethunders and the tempests and thedestroying elements as witnesses tothe truth of our testimony and thethe truths we proclaim would rise in judg-ment against the wicked in the great day of the Lord. 
 584 THE DESERET NEWS. October 11DESERET NEWSWEEKLY.TRUTH AND LIBERTY.WEDNESDAY, -  OCT. 11, 1876. People's Ticket!FOR DELEGATETO CONGRESS, GEO. Q. CANNON.THE SEMI-ANNUAL CONFERENCE.FIRST DAYTHE Forty-seventh [forty-sixth] Semi-Annual Conference of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, con-vened this morning in the New Tabernacle, October 6th, 1876, at 10 o'clock.ELDER WILFORD WOODRUFFsaid the gospel of Jesus Christ was just as true to-day as it was in the days of Adam, or as it was in the days of Nauvoo. God never had had a people on the earth, but what he always held communication with them through his servants the prophets. The gospel had been restored in this our day, as the fulfilment of prophecy given in the scriptures. The Bible was the record of the dealings of God with the Jews, and those revelations given through John the Revelator on the Isle of Patmos, pertaining to the restoration of the gospel and the plagues, pestilences, and fam-ines that were to deluge the earth in the last days, would every one of them be fulfilled. The Book of Mormon is a record of a portion of the House of Israel that inhabited this continent, and the dealings of God with them through his ser-vants the prophets. The Book of Doctrine and Covenants contained many revelations that God gave to his servant Joseph Smith, many of them having been given before the church was organized. What made Joseph Smith what he was, was the power of God, and the Gospel of Jesus Christ.By the power of God this people was enabled to receive the testi-mony of his servants. By his pow-er this people had been gathered to this Territory. The once desert plains we now inhabited had become fruitful. By the power of God we were here living in peace, and had been sustained to bring about his purposes. The word of the Lord had gone forth that he would sus-tain his people who had received the testimony of his servants and keep his commandments. If the Lord had not kept his promise we should long since have been scat-tered before our enemies. Let us be encouraged and pray for his holy spirit to be with us, that we might keep his commandments, for Zion must be built up. The unbelief of the world would not prevent the fulfilment of prophecy, and unless the people of this continent repent-ed of their sins, believed on Jesus Christ and were baptized for the remission of their sins, they would be visited by the judgments of God, according to the predictions of St. John. 
 [5 Apr, 2 pm][DNW 50:514-515, 4/13/95, p 2-3]Afternoon Session, 2 p. m.PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFFmade a brief explanation as to how theChurch had been loaded with financial burdens. He showed that it had beenmainly brought about by the ac-tion of the general government inseizing the property of the Saints. Much of that which was taken was money that the First Presi-dency did not have in possession and never had it. This action had entailed the undertaking of burdensome obliga-tions. He spoke hopefully in relation to the prospect for the future, how-ever, and exhorted the Saints to do allthey could to make the burdens of the Church as light as possible by each local division being as far as practic-able, self-supporting.

 THE DESERET WEEKLY. 197PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF.Before the meeting closes I feel dis-posed to make a few remarks to myfriends. I had a very pleasant inter-view with Dr. Reiner at our office, and Irelated to him a certain principle which was presented by Joseph Smith at a conference in Illinois, before somefifteen thousand people. In speaking upon religious liberty, he said: "If I were the emperor of the world, and Ihad control of all the human family, I would sustain every man, woman and child on the face of the whole earth,in the enjoyment of their religion, let that religion be what it may." I have told the doctor that those were mysentiments. They are my sentimentstoday. I was much pleased with myinterview with our friend, and I havebeen pleased with his address here to-day. I do not feel to find any fault with it.I will say, for his benefit and any others that may be present, that onereason why we are strenuous in ourfaith and belief with regard to thisbeing the Church of Christ, is because the Gospel we have received is the Gos-pel that Paul taught, and he said:  "Though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you thanthat which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed." Another reason is that the gifts and graces which were in the Church in the days of Christ andthe Apostles are with us today andhave been with us since the organiza-tion of this Church.Now, I have a favor to ask of this congregation. This congregation iscomposed largely of Elders and mem-bers of the Church. There are manyElders here who have traveled abroad in the vineyard. Now, I say that many of the gifts and graces and miracles that were manifest in the days of Christ and the Apostles I have seen manifest in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and so have you.Whoever has traveled as an Elder of Israel throughout the nations, and has been true and faithful unto God in ad-ministering in the ordinances of the house of God, has had the power of God upon him sufficient to receive thosegifts and graces at the hands of theLord. They have been with the Lat-ter-day Saints. Now, I want every Elder who has ever preached abroad, and every man and woman who hasever been present when any of thesegifts and graces have been manifestâ€”when the sick have been healed, devils cast out, the lame made to leap, the blind to see, the deaf to hearâ€”I want every man and woman who have seen manifested any of these gifts and graces that were in the ancient Church, to raise their right hand. I do not want anybody to bear testimony of this ex-cept those who have seen it. -[Inresponse to this request, a large majori-ty of the congregation raised theirhands.]- I have seen the sick healed. Ihave seen devils cast out. The blind have seen, the deaf have heard; and allthe gifts and graces have been with us. While I was in Herefordshire I helpedcarry a sister into the water who had not walked for twelve or fifteen years, and we baptized her. When we con-firmed her she said she believed shehad faith sufficient to be healed. Presi-dent Young and Dr. Richards called up-on me and I told them of this case. I wanted them to administer to her with me in confirming her. We laid handson her, and President Young was mouth. That woman rose to her feet,

 W. WOODRUFF'S ADDRESS,TO THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS.I deem it to be a duty which I owe to God and his church, to express my feelingsand bear my testimony unto you, concerning certain things that are presented to you for your consideration; especially, the claims of elder Sidney Rigdon to the exclusive right to lead and govern the church of Latter-day Saints. I have care-fully examined the trial which elder Rigdon has had before the authorities of thechurch in Nauvoo, as given in the Times and Seasons, Vol. v. No. 17, and I am satisfied that a righteous decision has been given in his case. I do not make these remarks without my reasons, and I will hereby give those reasons.I will commence by asking where has elder Rigdon been since he made hisflaming speech in Far West, which had a tendency to bring persecution upon thewhole church, especially the head of it? Has he stood by the side of the prophetand patriarch as a true friend, to assist in carrying them through their trials, tribu-lations, and persecutions; Has he walked up into his place as a man of God, andstood beside the prophet as his counsellor? Has he in any way, been a pillar or support to the church, from that day until this? Has he sustained the cause, andused an influence to spread the work abroad since the persecution in Far West? Has he in any way sustained the priesthood with dignity and honour, for the lastfive years of his life? Or, has the prophet, in any point of view, leaned upon himas a counsellor, a staff, or support, for the last five years? Or has the prophet Joseph found elder Rigdon in his councils, when he organized the quorum of the Twelve a few months before his death, to prepare them for the endowment? And when they received their endowment, and actually received the keys of the kingdomof God, and oracles of God, keys of revelation, and the pattern of heavenly things; and thus addressing the Twelve, exclaimed, "upon your shoulders the kingdom rests, and you must round up your shoulders and bear it, for I have had to do it until now. But now the responsibility rests upon you. It mattereth not what becomes of me." I say, has this been the case with elder Rigdon, in any wise.No, no, verily no; but the reverse, until he had become like a millstone upon theback of Joseph Smith, the prophet, seer, and revelator. And I hereby bear mytestimony, that I heard the said Joseph Smith declare, that elder Rigdon had be-come like a millstone upon his backâ€”a dead weightâ€”and he had carried him longenough, and must throw him off; and in my hearing requested one of the quorum of the Twelve to bring him up before the Church, that he might be dealt withaccording to the law of the Church, that he might be cut off as a dead branch, andno longer encumber the tree, as there was sufficient testimony against him. Butthrough the pleadings of brother Hyrum Smith and others, he has been spared.Elder Brigham Young has been his friendâ€”spoke in his favour, in consequence of his age and former standing, hoping that he might reform, got the spirit of the work, and magnify his calling. Upon this principle he has been sustained long,until the branch became twice dead, and necessary to be severed from the tree. Elder Rigdon, for the last five years of his life, has mostly been shut up in the post-office; confined himself mostly to his own temporal affairs, manifesting butlittle interest in the affairs of the church; and when any alarm or report was in circulation unfavourable to the cause, if we could judge at all from the course he

 dead and give them a place and a standing in their fathers' house. Those who were drowned in the days of Noah were shut up in prison for a long time, and Christ, while his body lay in the tomb, went and preached to these spirits in prison, that they might live according to God in the spirit and be judged according to men in the flesh. [##1 Peter 3:19-20##] So Joseph Smith and Hyrum Smith, David Patten, and others, who have laid down their lives for the Gospel's sake, have gone to the spirits in prison and labored there; and you and I are called upon to attend to the duty of the redemption of ourdead while we dwell here in the flesh. This is our work.I feel thankful for the blessings we as a people enjoy. It requires that we shall be humble. We want to remember our prayers. There should be a great deal of praying in Israel; not public prayers alone, but every man should go into his closet and there call upon God and ask Him to sustain Zion, sustain the Presidency of the Church, and the Twelve Apostles, with all men who bear the Holy Priesthood in the earth. Upon the shoulders of these men devolves the duty to go forth and warn this generation of thejudgments which are to come. Yet our numbers are few, compared with the fourteen hundred millions of people that dwell in the flesh. There-fore, do not be afraid of getting counsel from the presiding authorities in the Church. They will not counsel you wrong. They know better than to do that. They are anxious for this people to be united. We have received the ordinances of the house of God and have entered into cove-nant to build up Zion, and that is what we should live for. For I tell you,the God of heaven requires this at our hands. The devil has no power to overthrow the purposes of God. The Lord is above him, and he cannot go beyond what the Lord permits.Brethren and sisters, this is the way I feel to-day. Eighteen hundredyears have passed away from the time the Apostles of Christ were put to death and the Priesthood was taken home to God, and remained there until He gave it to Joseph Smith, who was raised up to stand at the head of this dispensation. Jesus said to Joseph Smith and those first Elders:For thou art called to prune my vineyard with a mighty pruning, yea, even for the last time. [##Doctrine and Covenants 24:19##]They were commanded to go out and warn the world and to preach theGospel, so that their garments might be clean of the blood of all men.  This is our calling. I wish we were better than we are, and that we had more of a disposition to do what the Lord requires of us. But we are poor, weak men. Yet there are those among us that would go to death rather than break these commandments of God which Brother Cannon referred to. And well they might. It pays no man to sin. There is no salvation or glory in it; but there is sorrow in it. If you occupied the position that I do, you would be where some of the sorrow is manifest.  We hear occasionally of men going astray and witness the sorrow that comes upon them when their eyes are opened to understand their condi-tion. They would give everything they possess on earth if it had not happened; but the day is past and they have to suffer for it. I am anxious myself that all the Latter-day Saints will try to keep the faith while they live upon the earth. Our lives are short here, even if we live to be one

Some acknowledged itwas a miracle, but said it was through the power of the devil. Those prin-ciples have been with us from the be-ginning, and will be with us until the winding up scene, as far as we do our duty. We have this testimony beforeus, and the same is manifest in any congregation of the Saints anywhere. Some time ago I met a man and a wo-man against the Valley House here.  The woman said to me, "Do you know me?" I said, "No, I don't." "Do youknow this man?" "No, I don't." "Well," said she, "he was born dumb, and when he and I were baptized in Here-fordshire, you laid hands on him andhis speech was given to him, and hehas been able to talk from that day to this." I do not speak of these things boastingly. We have no chance for boasting, because any man who hasthese gifts knows they are of God, and not of man. I never saw a minute in my life when I felt I had occasion to boast of any gift or blessing that God gave to me. Whatever power I have received, whatever I have been able todo, has been by the gift of God.I pray God my Heavenly Father that we may always live in that way andmanner that when we arrive on theother side of the veil we shall receive all those gifts and blessings that belong to the Saints of God who have been true and faithful in any age of theworld.  This people are called to preach the Gospel. We have traveled to al-most all nations. Thousands, upon thousands have been brought into the Church. Many of them are gathered here in the valleys of the mountains.  We trust that the course we are pur-suing may be such that we may bejustified before the Lord. There is nodoubt but there is opportunity to im-prove in many of these things. With regard to religion, every man has a right to his religion. It is between him and God; and it is between us and God. Inasmuch as we do our duty, when weget through we shall inherit all the blessings that have been promised untous; and so will any people that keep the commandments of God.

 224 THE DESERET NEWS. [APRIL 13, 1864.Elder Woodruff spoke on the riches of the Gospel.  The citizens of the world sought after what they called wealth, and high places; but there was no wealth to compare with the wealth of the grace of God, and no honor like to the honor of membership in the Church of God. The safest thing for the people was to keep the commandments of the Almighty and to seek to possess the Holy Ghost. When men violated the commandments, they were easily purchased or the service of the Devil. He encouraged home labor and on home pro-ducts, the sources of true wealth and indepen-dence. 
 W. L. SkidmoreMar. 7 [18]95. 
 ELDER WILFORD WOODRUFF was the next speaker. He alluded to the departure from the true order of the 
 pursued, it had a tendency to increase trouble and disturbance, instead of decreasing it. It is true, that elder Rigdon attended some of the councils that president Smith held with the Twelve and others, before his death, while giving them instruc-tions; but I heard president Smith say, that he came in without his wish or invi-tation, as he had no confidence in him. Elder Rigden and his friends would nowclaim, before the church and the world, that he holds the keys of the kingdom of God of the last dispensation, above the Twelve, the church, &c. I am ready to admit before the whole church and the world, that he does hold one key be-yond the Twelve; one that they do not holdâ€”one that God never held, nor Jesus Christ, nor any true prophet, patriarch, or apostle; Joseph and Hyrum Smith wereutter strangers to it. And if we can judge from his own mouth, accordingto the testimony given on his trial, we would suppose that Lucifer, who made war in heaven, was its author; and that it had been handed down unto the present day, and with it elder Rigdon has unlocked his heart, and pour-trayed before our eyes what was in it. What is it? Hear it, all ye Latter-day Saints! Listen, O Earth, and judge the fruits of this Key. He threatens toturn traitor, publish against the church in public journals, intimating that he wouldbring a mob upon the church, stir up the world against the saints, and bring dis-tress upon them, &c. Times and Seasons, vol. v. p. 650â€”653. This ought to bea sufficient reason for any true hearted Latter-day Saint to turn away from himwith disgust, and treat all such men and principles according to their desert,which is, to let them entirely alone; for a more despicable principle never ex-isted in heaven, earth, or hell, than to prove a traitor to our God, our cause, and our friends, and bring distress upon the innocent, and that too by turning againstthe very cause that a man has spent a portion of his life to build up, and declared, while in the faith, that it was true and righteous; for in all such cases there is entirely a misrepresentation of truth and facts, in order to accomplish the intendedevil, while a true statement of facts would advance the cause. This same prin-ciple was manifest in the case of Lucifer, Judas, Arnold, and many apostates in this church, who, when they could not get their own ends answered, would threaten to bring mobs upon the church, and in some instances have done so. Iwould ask has Joseph or Hyrum Smith ever held such a key as this, or manifested such a spirit as this? No, never; they have despised it in their hearts. President Smith seemed to be sensible that such fruit was growing in the breast of elderRigdon; and if he had accomplished what duty appeared to present to his mind upon that subject, that branch would have been severed from the tree before his death; but through mercy it was spared until it has produced fruit which is evil inits tendency, and dangerous to the welfare of the Church and Kingdom of God.I would again ask, has elder Brigham Young ever manifested any knowledge ofthe key above spoken of, or any spirit or disposition to turn against the church inany time of trial or persecution from its commencement? Has he ever deserted Joseph, Hyrum, his brethren, or the cause, in one instance, since the foundation of this church? No, never, in one instance. He has always been ready to go and come at the bidding of the Lord. He has not said so; but he has always said come. He has set the example and led the way, until he has traversed sea and land, at home and abroad, native and foreign countries, until he has borne off thekeys of the kingdom of God in connexion with the Twelve, with honour and dig-nity, since they were committed to his charge. He has followed President Smith's footsteps closely for the last twelve years of his life, and especially the last fiveyears; while elder Rigdon has, at the same time, been confined to the Post-office, apparently manifesting no interest in the welfare of the church and building up ofthe cause. The spirit of wisdom and counsel has manifested itself in the course and deliberations of elder Young. He has not only had much experience with president Smith, but he has proved himself true and faithful in all things commit-ted to his charge, until he was called to hold the keys of the kingdom of God in allthe world, in connexion with the Twelve, was the first to receive his endowment, from the hands of the prophet and patriarch, who have leaned upon him in con-nexion with the Twelve, for years, to bear off this kingdom in all the world. Andthey have done it with honour, labouring both day and night, making every sacrifice 
 hundred years old, compared with the great eternity before us. The dead are there whom we have redeemed, and we certainly do not want to pur-sue a course whereby we will forfeit the honor belonging to us connected with their salvation. It does not pay for any man to lose his faith in God, or to dishonor the Priesthood which he holds; but we should pursue such a course that when we get through we will be satisfied with our lives.  We are in the midst of a world of sin and temptation. It is a constant warfare with us. It was with the Savior. He was tempted all through His life, and He is an example for us. Certainly we have never passed through more than the Savior did, nor as much. But He through all His life remained true and faithful to His Father and to His calling as the Savior of the world. He prayed a great deal, and He mourned before the Lord over the sins of the world. To-day He is in our midst. He is our Advocate with the Father. He is watching over us, and He will do all that He can for our salvation.We have everything to encourage us. When you think of eternal life; when you think of the heavenly hosts; when you think of those that have gone before us, awaiting the final resurrection of the dead and the coming of the Son of Man to wind up the scene and enter into His glory, what is there than can tempt any man to depart from the Gospel of Christ? There is nothing worse than for a man to yield to sin after he has embraced the Gospel. We should labor against sin and temptation.I believe this is all I want to say to you. I am glad to meet with you. I do not attend meetings a great deal. But I am at my desk every day in the week about 9 o'clock except Saturday, and when the end of the week comes I am weary in body, and need rest. I always enjoy myself however, among the Latter-day Saints in their conferences when I do attend. I have traveled many years in this Church. Many of our fathers, brothers, and sisters have passed off. We are left; but we shall soon follow them.  I pray God that He will give us power as His servants and Saints tomagnify our calling and walk uprightly before Him, that we may be saved in the kingdom of God, for Jesus' sake. Amen.

 THE DESERET WEEKLY. 529GENERAL CONFERENCE.The Sixty-sixth Semi-annual Con-ference of the Church of Jesus Christof Latter-day Saints convened in theTabernacle, Salt Lake City, onFriday, October 4th, 1895.PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFFsaid: I feel thankful, my brethrenand sisters, that I have the privilegethis morning of attending this Sixty-sixth Semi-Annual Conference of theChurch of Jesus Christ of Latter-daySaints, with the Elders of Israel andthe Saints of the living God. My firstattending any conferences of thisChurch was in 1834, and from that daytill the present, from time to time, ascircumstances have permitted, I haveenjoyed this blessing. And while theProphets, and Apostles, and Eldersand Saints of God, a grea[t]many of them, and a number of themwho have assembled in these days, aretoday upon the other side of the vail,still other men as Apostles andProphets and Elders and members ofthe Church stand in the flesh, follow-ing in their footsteps. I feel thankfulto have the privilege of meeting withthe Apostles and the various quorumsof the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat-ter-day Saints today. And while weare together during this conference, Ihope and trust that we may all of ushave our hearts lifted up in prayerand thanksgiving to God and ask Hisblessing that we may be guided byHis Holy Spirit in whatever we arecalled to teach to the Saints, and thelabors we have to perform as thepeople of God. We have great reasonto rejoice, great reason to be thankfulto our Creator, to God, our HeavenlyFather, for His mercies and blessingsover us today.The hand of the Lord may veryclearly be seen, I think, by all men whoenjoy the Spirit of God, in the pasthistory of the Latter-day Saints. Hishand has been over us since our or-ganization in 1830, until the presenttime. We have passed, of course,through many trials and tribulations,but the Lord's mercy is over us, andwe are plan ted here in the mountainsof Israel, the Zion of God, and placedhere with responsibilities resting uponus to be carried out in our day andtime. I am pleased to meet with theApostles, and trust, as far as we havetime and opportunity, we shall havethe privilege of hearing from them.But I will say that President Snow isexpected to be absent from us for aday or so, in attending the funeral ofJudge Smith, of Brigham City, and Iwill call upon him this morning tooccupy a little time in talking to us. 
 THE DESERET WEEKLY.  509President Wilford Woodruff.Before dismissing this conference, I want to say that to me it has been the most interesting I have ever attended. I have never beforeseen the Latter-day Saints as ready ason this occasion to spend the same num-ber of days together in listening to the teachings and counsels of the servants of God. The Lord has said: "Whom-soever ye bless shall be blessed, andwhomsoever ye curse shall be cursed."I never cursed anybody in my life, andI do not feel like doing so now, for myheart is full of blessings to the Latter-day Saints, to my counselors, to the Twelve Apostles, to the Seventies, to theHigh Priests, to the Elders, Teachers and Deacons, to the Lower Priesthoodâ€”all our brethren and sisters through-out the Church.I entertain the same sentiments ashave been expressed here by PresidentCannon toward those who are not ofus religiously. There is a feeling offriendliness toward us, I think, in these valleys, on the part of those out-side of this Church; they seem to feelin their hearts to give us those rightsand privileges which belong to us,under the laws of God and man. Someof the judges have been ready to re-ceive our testimony, our manifestoes, and have seen fit to give and adminis-ter righteous judgment. All such menhave my blessing and prayers, andconfidence. I feel that God will blessthem and all who perform theirduties with clemency in righteousnesstoward their fellow men.

And I can testify be-fore God, angels and men that the same power, and the same spirit of revela-tion were manifest in his workup to the day of his death as were manifest in the work of the Proph-et Joseph. It is true, Joseph Smith'slife was short. The Savior labored only three and a half years, after Heentered into the ministry, before He was crucified. The Prophet Joseph labored fourteen years before He was martyred. President Brigham Younglived longer. He led this Church quite a number of years. I was withhim when he came into this valley. I was in the same carriage with him. He was taken sick on the Weber. Anumber of the camp were taken sick, caused, no doubt, by the change in coming to these mountains from the region we had left. He began to re-cover from the hour that he enteredinto this valley. He came here, and what did he do? I will name a few circumstances. He pitched camp some distance southeast of here. Thenext morning he and the Twelve whocame with him took a walk. He had been quite feeble, but he was then ableto walk with the assistance of his staff.We walked along until we came to this Temple Block. It was covered with sagebrush. There was no mark to in-dicate that God ever intended to place anything there. But while walkingalong Brother Brigham stopped very suddenly. He stuck his cane in the ground and said, "Right herewill stand the great Temple of our God." We drove a stake in the place indicated by him, and that particular spot is situated in the middleof the Temple site. One of the first things President Young did after hegot here was to order the preparing ofa block down here, called the Old Fort,where the camp could gather to. Thiscountry then was very desolate, cov-ered with wild sage, and that pretty near dead, too. There was hardly any-thing here with life, owing to the ex-cessive dryness. We went to work and surrounded this ten acre block to pre-serve ourselves; put adobie walls on three sides and log cabins on the eastside. This was the wisdom displayedby President Brigham Young all hislife -- care and caution, and safety forthe people. He then went to work and laid out this city. There was not a living soul in this valley excepting afew Indians who would eat roasted crickets for their dinner. He laid out these streets, these sidewalks, theseblocks. He laid out this Temple blockhere. A number of councils were hadwith regard to it. Brother George A.Smith was very anxious that weshould have forty acres instead of ten;so much so that there was a vote taken to lay forty acres out. After-wards President Young thought tenacres in a city of this kind was all that should be devoted to an interest of this character. So BrotherGeorge A. Smith surrendered hisviews, and we all voted for ten acres. When the city was laid out and these other arrangements made we returnedto Winter Quarters, where President Young got his family and returned with them and some of the Saints; andtwo or three companies followed thesame season.I name these things for the benefit of those who consider that there hasbeen no growth in the Church and Kingdom of God since the death of theProphet Joseph. President Younglaid the foundation of four Temples in this Territory. Three of these Temples are now in operation, and the other is being built right here. The Latter-day Saints have gone to work and labored in these Temples by the command-ment of God, for the blessing of theliving and redemption of their dead, and a million of men and women,whose bodies are returned to dust, andwhose spirits are in the spirit world, have received the benefits of the Gos-pel by the power of God and the work of the Elders, under the direction of President Young. Is this aloss of prestige? Is there no hand of God in this? Is there no pro-gress in this?" These things certainly were not accomplished in the life ofJoseph Smith, although Joseph Smithreceived revelations with regard toTemples, and the ordinances and en-dowments afterwards administered inthe Temple at Nauvoo. He also built the first Temple, in Kirtland, and many blessings were revealed in thatTemple, and this work was continued while he lived, as far as he had the power. I remember well the firsttime I read the revelation giventhrough the Prophet Joseph concern-ing the redemption of the dead -- one of the most glorious principles I had everbecome acquainted with on earth. To think that I and these Latter-day Saints could go forth into the watersof baptism and redeem our fathers, ourmothers, and those that have gone be-fore us, in the lineage of our father's house, and they come forth and re-ceive a part in the first resurrection! Well might the Prophet say God hasfulfilled His promise that in the last days He would raise up saviors upon Mount Zion, and the kingdom shouldbe the Lord's. Never did I read arevelation with greater joy than I did that revelation. I have often re-ferred to the course we pursuedin connection with that. JosephSmith himself (many of you may recol-lect the time) went into the Mississippi river one Sunday night after meeting, and baptized a hundred. I baptized another hundred. The next man, a fewrods from me, baptized another hun-dred. We were strung up and down the Mississippi, baptizing for our dead. But there was no recorder; we attended to this ordinance without waiting tohave a proper record made. But the Lord told Joseph that he must have recorders present at these baptisms --men who could see with their eyes and hear with their ears, and record thesethings. Of course, we had to do the work over again. Nevertheless, thatdoes not say the work was not of God.Well, the Lord manifested a great work in the labor of Brigham Young.He filled these mountains here for a thousand miles, under His direction,with cities, towns and villages. Hegave counsel in all these things. Brig-ham Young was the architect of this building (the Tabernacle). He was the architect of the Temple thatwe are building here. I say to theLatter-day Saints that God was withhim. He was with John Taylor. Hehas been with Wilford Woodruff. Hewill be with those that follow me; forthe Lord will never permit this people to be led only by the revelations of Jesus Christ. He will be with theseApostles of the Lord, and will con-tinue with them until the coming of the Son of Man. These things aretrue. Zion will arise, and grow, andflourish; the glory of God will rest upon her, and the Lord Almighty willfulfil all the promises that He hasmade concerning His work in the lastdispensation and fulness of times.The spirit of inspiration was with Brigham Young from the day that heentered into this work till he laid downhis life here upon his bed. I bear my testimony to these things. Therenever has been a time, either in theseTemples or anywhere else, but the Lord has made manifest His will on any point on which light was desired. To my certain knowledge the Lordgave revelations in St. George Templeto His servants there, upon points of doctrine we did not understand. President Young was there. I wasthere. Brother McAllister and others labored there; and we knew these things.So I say there is no man that goes intothese Temples to labor, or goes into the vineyard of the Lord to labor, who, if he will live his religion and do his duty, will fail in receiving the mind and will of God. Yes, the Lord has raised up saviors upon Mount Zion, and thekingdom is the Lord's. It is His work. And we have the great power as Latter-day Saints to go into thesetemples and redeem our dead, and at-tend to ordinances for them that theynever heard of in their day and gener-ation. What will be the condition of these saviors upon Mount Zion? TheseSaints of the Lord will hold the keys ofsalvation to their Father's house to theendless ages of eternity. There neverwill be a time when that power will betaken from them. We ought to realizethese things, and we ought to prize theblessings which God has put in our hands. I had a great desire, when thatrevelation was given, for the redemp-tion of my Father's house. Father Smith was the first patriarch to theChurch. He was a literal descendant of Joseph who was sold into Egypt. When he laid his hands upon men's heads the spirit of blessing and of prophecy rested upon him. He told me that I should bring all of my father's house into the Church. I dwelt upon that with a great deal ofinterest; and the first time I visited my father's house, although it wasseveral years after this, I baptized himinto this Church, and my stepmother, and my sisters, and everybody thatwas in my father's house, even a Methodist class-leader who was board-ing there. I organized a branch of the Church in Farmington, Connecticut,and almost all of the members were my relatives. I afterwards broughtmy father up here, where he died, andhis body lies in the cemetery.There are a great many things con-nected with these matters that I feel torejoice in. The more light we have,the more revelations of God we have,the more we shall prize these privi-leges. It is a great blessing that we stand in the flesh in this last dispensa-tion and fulness of times; and where we can open our hearts to understandthese blessings, all of us will labor, as far as we have opportunity, to attendto this duty for our dead. I do not 
 required of them; leaving their homes, families and country, to establish the work of God, and lay the foundation for the deliverance and redemption of Israel. AndI can say with every sentiment of my heart, and feeling of my soul, as has president Young, "that if there are but ten men left, who hang on to the truth, to Joseph and the temple, and are willing to do right in all things, let me be one of that number." If it cost me my life to defend the truth of the everlasting gospel of the Son of God, and to build upon the great and mighty foundation which God has laid in this last dispensation and fulness of times, through the instrumentality of his servant Joseph, the prophet, seer, and revelator, for the pruning of the vineyard once more for thelast time, for the warning of the Gentiles, for the salvation of the honest in heart, and meek of the earth, the building up of Zion, the establishment of Jerusalem, thefinal deliverance of Israel, and to prepare the Saints for the hour of judgment which is to come, and to secure unto the righteous an exaltation of glory beyond the veil; I say, if it cost me my life, let it go; I want to be among the number; I am readyto follow the example of those who have gone before meâ€”when my work is done, I am ready to be offered, if necessary.I had rather see ten men seal a righteous testimony with their blood, than to see oneman turn traitor, shed innocent blood and damn his own soulâ€”for the object in living andlabouring in the cause of God is to secure a part in the first resurrection, eternal life,and immortal glory. A religion that is not worth maintaining at the expense of life is notworth having, "for he that will seek to save his life shall lose it, and he that will lay down his life for my sake, the same shall find it." "And again, I will prove you, whetheryou will abide in my covenant, even unto death, saith the Lord." Many of the patriarchs, prophets, Jesus, the apostles, David, Joseph, and Hyrum, and many others, have sealed their testimony with their blood.Shall we then, as elders of Israel, or Latter-day Saints, back out, fear and tremble, or give up the work, because elder Rigdon threatens to turn traitor or bring mobs upon us, because he cannot make the church bow to his notion of things? No, God forbid. It shows very clearly that he has not the spirit of Christ, for the Lord nor one of his followers ever did such a thing; and it is sufficient to open the mind of every saint to see where he stands.  As far as my faith, prayers, influence, and labor, will effect anything, they will go to sus-tain president Young, and in connexion with him the quorum of the Twelve, in holdingthe keys of the kingdom of God, as they have been delivered unto them by the revelationof Jesus Christ, and in the endowments they have received under the hands of the prophetJoseph, and also all the quorums of the church as they have been set in order in thechurch and kingdom of God in these last days, through the voice of the prophet, seer, andrevelator, who has been raised up and laid the foundation, and sealed his testimony with his blood.And I wish to say to all the elders of Israel and saints of God, that the time has come, when we need a double portion of the spirit of Joseph's God to rest upon us, we should gird up the loins of our minds. Watch and be sober, maintain the priesthood with dignity, have the cause of God fully at heart, labor faithfully for its promotion while the day lasts, for night will soon come when no man can work. We should practice virtue and holiness before the Lord, and shun the very appearance of evil. We should enter our closets, and call upon God for wisdom to direct us in every duty in life. Our object should be to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ to this generation, and present those principles that willsave the souls of men.If there is any man in this church that does wrong, that breaks the law of God, it mat-tereth not what his standing may be, whether among the Twelve, the High Priests, Seven-ties, or Elders, or in any other standing, there is a tribunal that will reach their case inprocess of time, there is authority before whom they can be tried. Therefore let no one turn against the cause of God, and stop in the road to destruction, on the plea that some-body has done wrong: it is no excuse for you or I to do wrong because another does: the soul that sins, alone must bear it. Should I step aside from the path of duty it would not destroy the gospel of Jesus Christ, or even one principle of eternal truth, they would remain the same. Neither would it be any excuse for you to commit sin! but I shouldhave to bear my own sins, and not the sins of othersâ€”so with all men.Therefore, let me exhort all ye elders of Israel and saints of God to rise up in the ma-jesty and dignity of your calling, make full proof of your ministry and covenant. Sustain by your works the authorities, keys, and priesthood, of God in all its bearings and appen-dages, through this last dispensation, for the eyes of God, angels and men, are over you,and when the work is finished, you will receive your just recompence of reward.W. WOODRUFF. 
 168 GENERAL CONFERENCE.Elder Hedlock then spoke on the purpose of a general conference, and the ne-cessity of unity of feeling and action, and of order in the conferences, remarking that branches raised up since last conference cannot form themselves into confe-rences without the decision of a general conference, and persons seeking to renderthemselves independent of those who were appointed by the last general conference, are out of order, and violating the laws of the kingdom of God. He remarked thatthe presiding elders of branches should be associated with the officers of those bran-ches in doing all things in righteousness for rolling onward the kingdom of God; and also, that the presidents of conferences should be united with the presiding officers of branches in the same great cause. Thus should all be united in the great purpose in which they were engaged, viz., the salvation of the human familyThe occasional offences that arise from individuals whose minds are too contracted to grasp the sublimity of the subject of salvation, we should learn to endure, andexercise forgiveness rather than raise an obstacle against the progress of the work.He exhorted the audience to exert themselves to live as saints to day, and if suchwas their continued purpose, they would not err very far from the path of rectitude.The president then called for the delegates to represent the condition and stand-ing of the conferences.Elder Milton Holmes stated the Manchester conference to be in a very good con-dition; the prospects, indeed, were very cheering, perhaps more so than at any otherperiod, and every thing seemed to foretell the reaping of a rich harvest. He ex-horted the saints to listen to the counsel given, and bore a strong testimony to thetruth of the work.Elder Leonard Hardy stated that he had not long been connected with the Pres-ton conference, but the prospects to the best of his knowledge were much improved.The officers in council were united, and there was a probability of some being bap-tized. He also bore testimony to the truth, and prayed for the success of thework.Elder Elisha H. Davis rose to state the condition of the London conference,which he said was very satisfactory at the present time. They had witnessed the gradual increase of the church, and of very respectable people of the congregationsthat were seeking after the truth. The officers were but few, but they were doing good, and though the Saints themselves were generally speaking but poor, yet theywere determined to press forward and be united in the work of the Lord. The spirit of the gathering was very powerful among them, many had already left forZion, and many more were very anxious to go. The meetings were well attended,and some were baptized weekly, He requested an interest in the prayers of theSaints, that he might be endued with wisdom and prudence; the enemies were on the alert to detect, if possible, any thing that might be thought a false step, and without the prayers and faith of the Saints, he felt quite incompetent for the taskdevolving upon him.Elder Galley stated that the Macclesfield conference, from the past year's expe-rience, was much improved, and never had the Spirit of God given stronger testi-mony of the truth than these last three months. The officers were united indesiring the glory of God. He further stated that the conference was extensive asregarded the distances of places, and that his circumstances in business did not allow him to pay that attention to it which it required, that other labourers were much wanted, and he requested that some travelling elder or high priest might besent amongst them.Elder Robert Crook rose to report the condition of the Birmingham conference, and we rejoiced much to see our aged brother manifesting almost the agility of youth. He stated that he rejoiced much to see the Saints by whom he was sur-rounded, and he rejoiced also at the condition in which he had left his conference,their councils were in peaceâ€”unity and love prevailed amongst them. He alsorejoiced much in the late visit of elder J. B. Meynell, and thanked God for his visit, and he was very sorry that he was leaving England, for he knew they were of one heart and of one mind. He exhorted his brethren to be loyal subjects of the realm, stating that he prayed for her majesty the Queen three times a day, until the magistrates themselves declared him to be a most loyal subject. He also stated

 To Wilford Woodruff and the first presidencyof the church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day SaintsSalt Lake City December 1896Dear brethren,As every man that mostly works for day'swages, so am I glad for your action to change theFast day to the weekly day of worship.Yet I do not feel satisfied in one point,inasmuch as you say that we shall bear testimony to eachother, for that seems to contradict recent teachings onthat subject: It is two years last Summer thatapostle Francis M. Lyman in a conference in Grantsvillegave us the following instructions:That the Fast day meeting is not for preaching nor is it a testimony-meeting, but it is essentiallyfor praying and confessing our sins before the saints.I also heard him repeat this instruction at the nextfollowing general conference of the church, and I acceptedhis word as the Lord's and have sought to obey it, and Healso has heard my prayers. It was also given to me to conceive how the other part of this teaching, if carriedout, would soon develop in a beautiful feature of ourfast meetings, wich might relieve them of the dullness, thatis creeping upon them. An hour spent in self-review among brethren, what a blessing that might prove for thosethat partake in it!But one lone voice would not make a meetingof that kind and one that might attempt to break the ice by openinghis heart before his brethren, would feel chilled and close up uponhimself again, if there was no response to his sentiments.In other words, unless the meetings should be conductedaccordingly, one individual alone would hardly dare toenter this field wich is an unknown country to most of us. And I am sorry to state that in my wanderings in these 2 yearsI have not seen nor heard of any move in this direction and nowyour ruling seems to dispense altogether with the necessity to do so. 
 THE DESERET WEEKLY. 555want to go into the spirit world andmeet with my progenitors and havethem say to me, "You held the keys ofmy redemption and my salvation and you neglected to do this work, and Iam not redeemed." I have labored,with the assistance of my friends,in the St. George Temple, for three thousand of my dead friendsof my father's house and my mother's house, and have done all that I could for them. This is the greatest joy of my life, when I look upon these thingsand realize that I have had this privil-ege here on the earth. And when I lay my body in the tomb and my spiritgoes into the spirit world, I shall re-joice and have glory with them in themorning of the resurrection, inasmuch as they receive these principles."Well," perhaps you may say, "whatif these people whom you have beenbaptized for do not receive the Gospel?"That will be their fault, not mine.This is a duty that rests upon all Israel,that they shall attend to this work, as far as they have the opportunity here on the earth.Brethren and sisters, I felt as thoughI wanted to bear this testimony to theLatter-day Saints. The Lord hasmanifested this work from the day that Joseph Smith received the records ofthe stick of Joseph in the hands of Ephraimâ€”the Book of Mormon. Fromthat day until this there has been notime that the Lord has forsaken His Church. We have been persecuted, we have been afflicted, and we have passedthrough serious trials in our day; but the Lord has carried us through all these things. And we are here in the midst of the everlasting hills, given byrevelation to old father Jacob, who laid his hands upon the head of his sonJoseph and said that he was "a fruitful bough by a well, whose branches runover the wall," and that his blessings prevailed above those of his progeni-tors "unto the utmost bound of theeverlasting hills;" and these blessingswere to rest upon him and his posteri-ty. These things have come to pass. The majority of the Latter-day Saints are through the loins of Ephraim, the son of Joseph. Ephraim is "a mixedcake." He is mixed among the na-tions of the earth, and it is those whohave the blood of Ephraim in them who, when they hear the word of theLord, receive it; and all that God haspromised through these Patriarchs and their posterity will come to pass. So with regard to Judah. Moses told theJews what would befall them. He told them what would take place intheir Temples and in their cities. Theybuilt altars to Baal and broke theircovenants, and he told them they would be scattered and peeled, and de-stroyed by pestilence, by famine, andby the sword; women would eat their own children, and a remnant of them would be taken from Jerusalem and scattered among the whole Gentile world, and be trampled underthe feet of the Gentiles until the timesof the Gentiles were fulfilled. Thosewords have been fulfilled to the veryletter as fast as time would admit.We are in the hands of God. Our responsibilities are great, and we should try to magnify our calling, andnot set our hearts so much on thethings of this world that we neglectany of the oracles of God or the workof God for the living and the dead. God bless you all. Amen. 
 LATTER-DAY SAINTS' MILLENNIAL STAR.faithful to the God of Heaven and the Church and kingdom of God, it ismyself. When we look over the field in the last sixty-six years, and see all that the Lord has done since the organization of this Church, the num-ber who have passed away, and the many changes which have taken place,we ought to be thankful for the blessings of God. Our history has beena very peculiar one, and we have been called to pass through many events. We have arrived where the promises of God in the revelations in the Bible, Book of Mormon, and Doctrine and Covenants, by the voice of the Prophets of God, are being fulfilled before our eyes, before the heavens, and before the earth. We stand here to-day with this great and mighty responsibility resting upon us as the Holy Priesthood and the Saints of the Living God, to labor, and to be true and faithful to God, to our cove-ants, to the Gospel of Jesus Christ, to those laws and principles whichGod has revealed concerning the last dispensation and the fulness of times. I feel thankful for these blessings, and hope that during this conference the Apostles and the Elders of Israel and the people may be filled with the inspiration of the Almighty God; that we might compre-hend and understand the position we occupy to-day in the sight of heavenand earth; that the Spirit and power of God may be with us, that we may know the mind and will of God and rejoice together and be able to per-form the things required at our hands. I ask God to bless the Latter-day Saints who are asssembled in this conference, that these blessings may dwell with us during these meetings, from henceforth and forever. Amen.

 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 169that the Derbyshire conference was in a good condition at present, but much inneed of some active labourer.Elder George Simpson stated that there was not that union in the Staffordshire conference which was necessary for the well-being of the church, he hoped theywould take his conference into consideration, and that measures might be taken for their assistance.Elder John Banks stated that he had not had much time to become acquainted with the Edinburgh conference, having only been there about three weeks. Edin-burgh was a splendid city, the seat of much wisdom and learning, and it wouldrequire much wisdom and prudence to be exercised; but considering all circum-stances, he trusted that the coming year would yield them a rich harvest.Elder Richard Blakey stated that the Garway conference had many difficultiesto contend with, but still it was in a better condition than he had known it before.He should wish to call the attention to this conference as he was at present underthe necessity of retiring from his labours in the vineyard, in order to assist an aged father, whose growing infirmities called for his help.Elder James Houston stated that the branches in the Glasgow conference were in a very prosperous condition, full of union and love in their counsels; Lanerk, where be had been labouring, numbered 64 in about six months; he was sorry thathe was not better able to represent the whole conference, as its general condition was most satisfactory and encouraging.Elder James Ure briefly stated that the Sheffield conference was in a very cheer-ing condition.Elder E. F. Sheets remarked that the Bradford conference at his first visit rather alarmed him, but he thought he could now state that it was in very good order,and he knew not of a dissenting voice in the whole of the three branches of Bradford, Idle, and Leeds; more labourers were wanted, and he anticipated much good would be the result.Elder Thomas Smith said in reference to the Worcestershire Conference, that inits present condition, love and union were prevailing through the whole, with the exception of one case of difficulty, which would come before the meeting. BrotherMeynell had been visiting them and they had an excellent time. The conferencespread over an extensive country, and it was their intention to labour indefatigably in the coming season.The meeting then adjourned until evening.EVENING SERVICE.The service opened by singing. Prayer by Elder Hedlock, when the representa-tion of the condition of the conferences was resumed.Elder Stratton stated that generally speaking the branches were in a prosperous condition, that four new branches had been organized these last few months. The Isle of man branches were in a much better state, united, and the prospects weregood.Elder Speakman stated that the Clitheroe conference was in good standing, peaceand unity, and every good grace was to be found amongst them, none could be more inclined to adhere to counsel. They were a people that were full of humilitywhich had caused him much to rejoice; they were also ever ready to assist in rolling forward the kingdom of God, and they only need to be told their duty in orderto do it.Elder John Johnson said he had not been in the habit of speaking before so largeand respectable a congregation, but rather in the regions of darkness, and amongstthe blacks of the coalpit. He was, however, glad to say that though Cheltenhamhad, as it were, been torn up by the roots by persons who had never been sent there, yet he rejoiced to say that now the people were willing to listen to counsel, and the spirit of love and union was in their midst, indeed their condition was better than it had been for three years, and there was a great work to do.Elder Robert Martin said that the members in the Bedfordshire conference, with very few exceptions, were Saints indeed, many of them were of long standing. A good foundation had been laid, and the difficulties that had for a considerable time

 It is now the question with me: Is this an oversighton your part or are there any reasons for making the adviceof bro. Lyman invalid? If not and if we simply donot mind the one advice, is there any guarantee that wewill mind the other, though given by a higher authority?The chances are, we will not do it, but carry outon the Fastday the usual program of a testimony meeting, that is: after the meeting is given in the hands of the saints, some glibly tongued Elder will get up and â€” "for fearof the time going to waste" â€” fill it out by loading us downwith enough precepts to go on for the rest of our lives, of wich however we will not be more mindful, than he ishimself of what is becoming in a meeting.Not that this testimony-preaching has been withoutany results whatever: It has hushed the voice of our sistersand minor members in our testimony-meetings. they nowalways tell us, if we try at home to induce them to beartheir testimony: "Oh! I am not a preacher!"Preaching, then, has come to be considered as themain thing in our worship. But I sometimes wonder ifthe Lord would not be as well pleased, if we pushed thebigger part of it over board and put some more musicin its place. At least He says that He likes to hear thesongs of the saints, also their prayers, but I have not foundyet where He says that much about preaching without commission.Now my brethren I hope you will not take thisletter as an evidence of faultfinding, for I can tell you, although I believe you to be human and therefore liable tomake an occassional mistake, that I have full confidencein you, enough for instance, that for my part I wouldgladly have been left without the discloures â€” however interesting â€”of the last conference as I never before thought this caseto be any of our business.But this is a question that confronts me directly while trying to carry out the will of the Lord as revealedby His Servants and others may be in the same condition. We may therefore look forth for an enlightemnent in someshape from your source.In the meantime I remain, with especial respectYour brotherAlbert Kropfli[sideways text] Alfred KropflDec. 1896.Kropfli, AlbertDec. 1896 [end of sideways text]

 gospel by professing Christians. It wasalmost impossible for them to believe that continued revelation from the Al-mighty was necessary. The faith of the Latter-day Saints, however, was that it is God's right to rule and dictate by revelation. The law of tithing wasgiven by revelation, and no Saint couldneglect to comply with it and retain the spirit of the gospel. It was the duty of all to assist in building temples in which to attend to ordinances per-taining to the living and the dead.  None of the requirements of the gospelwould fall to the ground, for all must be fulfilled. The speaker exhorted thepeople to draw near to the Lord, that he might draw near to them, and that they might be filled with the light of truth.

 170 GENERAL CONFERENCE.troubled the churches were removed, and the principles are now much inquired after,and he felt assured that with wisdom and prudence much might be done, especiallyif more labourers were employed.Elder Thomas Margetts stated that the Leicestershire conference was not in so good a condition as he could wish to see it. The experience of the last six months had been very trying, but after all profitable. When an aspiring spirit arises, it is calculated to do much mischief; it had been so there, but the results he had no doubt would be beneficial; but notwithstanding all things, the prospects were still better than ever, and their congregations were crowded to excess. He earnestly requested a visit from some of the presidency as early as possible.Elder Thomas Smith stated that the Bath conference was in good standing, union and love prevailed in their midst, the gifts and blessings of the Spirit of God were abundant, the councils were conducted in peace and love, and the prospectswere very encouraging.Elder William Walker remarked in reference to Hull, that when he was sentthere, he could not in his address say brethren and sisters, for there was but one sister there. He continued his labours by preaching at the dock side to hundreds of people, but apparently in vain. He was at times almost in despair, but never-theless he received encouragement from the word of God, and continued his labours.He remarked also that the books of the church had been a great instrumentality in propagating the work in that neighbourhood. The prospects were now encourag-ing, and the minds of the people were in some measure turned to the contemplationof the principles of truth.Elder Dan Jones, from Wales, rose, under an attack of the fever and ague, and remarked that he believed it was the intention of the evil one to prevent him speaking that evening, but he was determined to bear his testimony in spite of every opposing power. He said that he came not in the character of a delegate: he represented no conference; for if he had but baptized one, he should be ableto represent three. But he would speak of a nation renowned in history, one of the most ancient nations of the earth, who had never been subdued, and to whomhe hoped to be instrumental in bearing the tidings of the work of God, in the lastdays. He enlarged on the characteristics of his people in a manner, and withan eloquence, that told how ardently he loved his native tribe and his father-land. He remarked that, for many years, as a mariner, he had been in search ofthe principles of truthâ€”he had sought it in almost every climeâ€”among the redmen of the woods, or the civilized denizens of the city, but he had found it not until he came in contact with the followers of the prophet of the Lord, the noto-rious Joseph Smith; but of that despised individual he would bear his testimony, and though he might feel more at home among a tribe of Indians, or on the deckof a ship, than upon that platform and before such an audience, yet he would not flinch from bearing a faithful testimony to the character of the servant of theLord. He had been with him in the domestic circle, he had been with him in peril and in prison, and only left him about an hour before the murderous deed of his assassination was perpetrated; and he had now come in obedience to the coun-sel of the martyred prophet, as a messenger to his native land, to bear testimony of the work for which his brother had died, and which he had sealed with his blood.[We would here remark that we are utterly incapable of doing anything like jus-tice to the address of Captain Jones, for though delivered while struggling with disease, such was its effect upon ourselves, and we also believe upon others, that we ceased to write, in order to give way to the effect produced upon our feelings.]Elder William Henshaw stated that Merthyr Tydvill conference was in a pros-perous condition. Two years ago he first went there and met with much opposition;but some became obedient to the gospel, and the signs followed the believers; gifts, blessings, and visions were in their midst, and the saints were rejoicing in the ful-ness of the gospel of Jesus Christ.Elder Wilford Woodruff then rose to represent his conference, to which he had pledged himself at an early part of the day. He said that he represented about twenty-eight states of the American Union, above one hundred thousand saints, a quorum of twelve apostles, the various quorums in the stakes of Zion, fifteen

 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 171quorums of the seventies, a conference with two temples of the Lord, one longago completed, and one fast hastening to its completion. After enumeratingmany other things, which, from the rapidity of his utterance, we failed to note,he remarked that the condition of the churches in America was more encouraging than at any former period in the history of the church.â€”The Saints were more universally of one heart and one mind, and the Spirit of Elijah's God was in their midst. He then addressed himself to the elders and officers by whom he was sur-rounded, exhorting them in all cases to abide by the laws of the land, and, thatno man, by keeping the laws of the kingdom of God, need violate the laws of therealm: that no one who infringed upon those laws in any manner would be sus-tained by the authorities of the church. We had nothing to do with the laws but to keep them. He further remarked that elders, generally, raised up churches like unto themselves, and therefore it behoved them to be an example to their flocks in all things that were holy and righteous. The kingdom of God was a kingdom of order, and a spirit of order ought to characterise every branch of the church.He rejoiced much in assembling with them that day, and in meeting such a vastconcourse of brethren and sisters as greeted his eyes that day: he rejoiced also to find things throughout the land in so good a condition as they were. He further exhorted the Saints not to be discouraged by their trials, but to contemplate the course of the Saviour, from the manger to the cross; he sought not for peace and popularity, but for the salvation of men. It was no sign, because men werepoor that they could not be useful and successful in propagating the principles oftruth; let us but remember from whence our power comes, and forget not, what elder Ward often endeavours to teach us, that union is strengh, that the grand secret of our success lies in being of one heart and of one mind; but, that on the contrary, division stops all blessings, and closes the heavens against us. Yes, he would say, the heavens were full of blessings for the Saints, but union and peaceamongst us could alone call them down upon us. He would, therefore, call uponthem, for God's sake, to be united in all things pertaining to the rolling onward of the kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.â€”The meeting was then closed with singing and prayer, and adjourned until the next morning, to assemble in thelarge room in Bridge-street, at ten o'clock.MONDAY MORNING.The meeting being opened by singing and prayer, elder Woodruff proceeded to speak on the great principles that should actuate the servants of the Lord, exhort-ing them to lay aside all principles of selfishness, and act according to counsel. To labour for the good of all, acting as one man before the Lord, in order to do thebest for the welfare of the kingdom of God.Elder Hedlock spoke on the condition of the church in Nauvoo, how they hadsuffered from time to time from unrighteous men getting into their society, whohad lost sight of the great principles of the kingdom of God,â€”and who sought only to aggrandise themselves at the expense of the entire community. Individuals had been amongst them at an early period, who had made extensive purchases of land, which had been enhanced in value by the gathering of the Saints, and thus they had taken an advantage of the people by disposing of their purchases at anexorbitant rate of profit. They had also had to suffer from various repeated lawsuits that had impoverished their resources, that otherwise might have been em-ployed in providing labour for the poor. He had looked at their situation, and hefelt anxious for the adoption of some plan that might mutually benefit all. He wasdesirous of preventing the spirit of monopoly from entering into their midst, and while he now contemplated as it were the energies of the people being thrown away amongst their enemies, he wished to adopt such means as should preserve amongstthemselves the combined industry of the Saints for the good of all. He then stated his views of the objects to be accomplished, and the benefit arising from the pro-posed scheme of a joint stock company, that should unite the efforts of the Saintson both sides the water for the good of all. He stated that the shareholders would be benefitted by the adoption of such a plan, inasmuch as the capital so employed,by judicious management, would in a few years double its capital. He further

It also makes mefeel uneasy at having to teach theirdoctrine to a certain extendt, althoughI often put the Truth before themand give them little bits of our Doctrinealthough I do not say what it is.Being organist also compels me toattend the church services, which arevery repugnant to me and I have nochance to attend our own meetingson a Sunday.

 172 GENERAL CONFERENCE.remarked that there must be a channel of communication between the Saints on both sides the Atlantic for the mutual benefit of all. He further remarked that there were a variety of means by which these ends might be accomplished, by pro-curing freight for ships, by procuring provisions for emigration form our brethren in the West, which, placed in bond in this country, would be a great advantage in the supply of sea stores to those that emigrated. He wanted also agents in all parts of the country to assist in the business of emigration, by posting our billswhen we had ships in hand, and by procuring passengers, which would afford afair remuneration for labour on business-like principles. All that we wanted was men of business to enter into this work, which must ultimately work for the good of all.Elder Ward then remarked that the great point before the meeting was, whether the scheme announced in the last MILLENNIAL STAR to the conferences was to be adopted or not.It was then unanimously voted that such a plan or association as that proposed should be adopted.It was then unanimously voted that brothers Wilson, Caruthers, M'cEwan,Brown, Clark, Milnes, Mason, Banks, Johnson, and Flint, resolve themselves into a committee to draw up resolutions, to be examined and discussed by the conference,and that they retire into the adjoining room for that purpose.The brethren of the committee having retired, elder Woodruff called the atten-tion of the conference to the various business lying before them in relation to the churches.Elder Woodruff first called for those brethren who were so situated as to givethemselves up to the ministry, when there arose elders J. D. Ross, James Ure, Glaud Roger, E. H. Webb, James Houston, Robert Crook, George Slater, Thos.Margetts, E. H. Davis, John Allen, J. A. Stratton, E. F. Sheets, William Walker,C. Miller, Milton Holmes, Leonard Hardy, George Eyre, William Speakman,Thomas Day, Henry Cuerden, G. P. Waugh, Dan Jones, William Henshaw, Wm.Allen, Thomas Smith, (of Worcester), Thomas Smith, (of Bath), Phillip West-wood, Charles Phelps, Hiram Clark, John Banks, John Johnson. The three last named were added, though the brethren had retired on committee.The case then arose, before alluded to, in reference to the Worcestershire confer-ence, which led to a variety of excellent teaching in reference to elders or others interfering in the settlement of difficulties where they were not sent. The adjust-ment of difficulties and the right of sitting in judgment belonging in an especial manner to the high priesthood, unless elders received a special commission for that purpose.It was then carried that the church in Coventry continue under the control of theWorcestershire conference.The meeting being closed by prayer, adjourned until two p.m.AFTERNOON SERVICE.This service being opened as usual, elder Ward rose to make some remarks on the responsibility of all connected with the kingdom of God. As individual mem-bers of the church we were by no means exempt from this, inasmuch as it was everyman and woman's duty to warn their neighbour. And as we received any portion of the authority of the holy priesthood, that responsibility increased, and he wouldassure the meeting that the presidency in this land justly estimated the import-ance of the position they occupied, and were well aware that they were answerable to God for whatever measures they adopted in connexion with their superintendance of this portion of his vineyard; and as they had no individual or party feelings, the Saints might rest assured that all measures which they might seek to carry, wouldbe with a single eye to the glory of God.Elder Hedlock then followed on the same principles.The condition of the Macclesfield conference was then laid before the meeting,when it was carried unanimously that elder William Walker (late of Hull) go la-bour there, under the presidency of elder James Galley.Elder Robert Crook having stated the necessity of some young active labourer 
 that I am a Latter Day Saint, say I ought to give up my position and emigrateat once. I try to show them why I shouldnot do so, but they only get angry.As my children are growing up andit is harmful for them being here, I havewritten to say that if an organist iswanted for the Tabernacle, that I shouldbe very pleased to apply for that positionThe organ I play on (a pipe organ) is thelargest in Lincoln. It has 42 stops,(only 16 less I believe than the Tabernacleorgan) three rows of keys, and 8composition pedals, besides a pedalkey board.I have been an organist for21 years. I began when I was 15and am now 36 years old.I have great experience inaccompanying choirs, both great and small.I can play all kinds of music.

 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 173being sent into the Derbyshire conference, it was carried that elder George Slater,late of Nauvoo, take the presidency there, recommending him to avail himself, as need might be, of the council of elder Crook.Staffordshire conference being next considered, it was carried that elder HiramClark take the presidency for the time being.Garway conference wanting a president, by the retirement of elder RichardBlakey, elder William Allen was unanimously voted to take the presidency thereof.The condition of the Mars Hill conference being brought forward, it was carried that elder E. F. Sheets (late of Bradford), preside over the same.It was then carried by the meeting that elder Glaud Roger preside over the Bradford conference, in the room of Brother Sheets.It was next unanimously voted that elder John Allen take the presidency over the Carlisle conference.It was also voted, that elder Robert Martin preside over the Bedfordshire con-ference, where he has been lately labouring.It was then unanimously carried, that Hull be organized into a conference, andthat elder Henry Cuerden preside over the same.It was then, with considerable good humour, unanimously voted that elder Dan Jones, form, and preside over Wrexham conference, consisting at present only of himself and wife. Some present wished to make elder Jones a present of some branches in the neighbourhood to begin with, but the feeling of the meeting was that he should build upon no other foundation than that which he had already got. Elder Jones made some interesting remarks on his position, and of his anxiety topreach the gospel to his countrymen in their native tongue, requesting an interestin the faith and prayers of the Saints for his success,â€”when elder Ward arose, andcalled upon the meeting, if they felt disposed to uphold brother Jones in his position, to signify it by a hearty Amen! which was most heartily responded to.It was then voted that elder G. P. Waugh labour under the direction of elderJohn Banks, in the Edinburgh conference.It was then voted that the branches of Louth, Taleby, and Wapload, be annexedto the Hull conference, under the presidency of elder Henry Cuerden.Voted also that Paul Harrison be ordained an elder, and go to labour in Ireland.Voted that Doncaster be appended to the Sheffield conference.Voted that Newhall branch be annexed to the Sheffield conference.Voted that Kidderminster be annexed to the Worcestershire conference.It was then unanimously carried that elder James Houston's appointment to la-bour in Lanark receive the sanction of the conference.The meeting which continued to a late hour, without interruption, then ad-journed unto Tuesday morning.TUESDAY.The meeting being opened by singing and prayer.Elder Webb was then called upon by the president to state the conditions of thebranches in his field of labour, viz., Chalford Hill, Avening, Tetbury, Kingswood,Cam, and Nimphsfield.It was then carried unanimously, that the before-mentioned branches be organ-ized into a conference, and that elder E. H. Webb preside over the same.It was then voted that Bath be organized into a conference, to be called theSomersetshire conference.It was then voted that elder George Robins go to labour in the Hull conference, under the presidency of elder Henry Cuerden.Elder John Johnson, president of the Cheltenham conference, being absent onthe committee, elder Phelps was called upon to lay the circumstances of the con-ference before the meeting, in relation to a lawsuit now pending. It appearedthat the Saints had been subject to interruption in their meetings of the most outra-geous and disgraceful character, notwithstanding they met in a place regularly certified; that being obliged to have recourse to law in their own defence, they hadbeen, and expected to be still more, involved in expenses, which without assistance they were not able to meet. Elder Woodruff remarked, that circumstances like

 174 GENERAL CONFERENCE.those in the Cheltenham conference might be the lot of any other, and that it be-hoved us to sympathise with our brethren, and render them what assistance we could.It was then unanimously resolved, that the presidents of conferences lay the case before the churches, and that the Saints be exhorted to render what assistancethey can, forwarding the same to Liverpool as early as possible, to be remittedto elder Johnson.Elder Ward made some remarks on conformity to the laws of the land, exhort-ing the brethren never to resort to physical force when oppressed by their enemies, inasmuch as there was abundant protection in the laws, when justly administered. He requested the brethren, that when they had acted according to principles of righteousness, and the laws of the land, in all things, and yet could not getprotection or redress from the magistrates, that they would send him the addresses of such persons, and he would adopt measures to teach them their duty. He hadbeen under the necessity of writing to two magistrates, and it behoved all the ser-vants of the Lord to become, as much as possible, acquainted with the laws of the land.The Committee of the Joint Stock Company then making their entrance, it was carried unanimously that the articles which had been drawn up by the Committee be read before the meeting, consecutively, and afterwards item by item, to be dis-cussed by the conference.After the reading of the articles,Elder Ward rose, in the first place, to move a vote of thanks to the brethren of the committee for their very arduous labour, in the production of the articleswhich had now been read, and which had occupied the committee some sixteenhours. This vote was most heartily and unanimously carried.Elder Thomas Wilson, president of the committee, then returned thanks,Elder Hedlock rose to express his gratification at the result of the committee, sofar, and as he had been the first to suggest the plan, he felt much to rejoice at the prospect of its ultimate success.It was then voted that Brother Brown read the articles one by one for the consi-deration of the conference.AFTERNOON SERVICE.The service being opened as usual, the following articles were for the time being agreed upon.
