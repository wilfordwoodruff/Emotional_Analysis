Somtimes it seems sutch a very long time and at  others but a few days and I feel quite encouraged when I reflect that nearly one quarter of the time has passed away. It is as bro Lanbert said the other day—much harder in the British mission to day, than it was years ago when you could go out and hold a meeting and have two or more come up afterwards and request baptism, then the Elders had something to stimulate them something to encourage them. but now we can travel the country from one end to the other and preach from daylight till dark and all the encouragement we get is the scoffs, scorns and contumely of and ungratful generation, or else our words fall like water on a ducks ENDENTRY 5 our way here. The green hills and verdant meadows coverd with the fir and yew trees and a variety of evergreen shrubs together with the ivy coverd cottages that one frequently sees in passing through the rural districts in the South of England, gives every thing the appearance of Spring rather than of Winter; and were it not for the few varites of desciduous trees which abound in this region  sutch as the oak, elm etc, it would  be difficult to define the seasons.

I am very sorry that my letter should have ben the means of causing you to take steps to secure my release against your own desires, and now you say you would  prefer to have me stay till spring, but it is my impression that you do so  simply because you are laboring under the belief that I would prefer to remain. Well Father all things considered it seems to me that it would be advisable for  me to return this Fall; my release has ben published in the Star and evrybody thinks that I am going; and besides that I shall have to move from my present quarters and seek lodgings elswhere as bro. Whitehead has taken in three lodgers and will not have a room for me, they ENDENTRY over six thousand miles to deliver this message and sound this warning note in their ear, and that by virtue of my having came so far to tell them if for no other reason they should properly investigate these important matters that they might be in a position to  intelligently decide whether ofur claim was valid or otherwise and I not only plead with them to consider the willfare of their own sould, but I testified to them in the name of Jesus Christ that God had again broken the speechless gloom of ages and spoken from the heavens and asserted his power and authority on the earth. They seemed much impressed with this solemn declaration but did not offer a poor Mormon Elder either food or shelter so he had to tramp back to Grays feeling thankfull that he had had the opportunity of warning a few more of the decree that has gone forth.  Yeasterday Thursday I went to Tillbury where over ENDENTRY attended both by Saints and Strangers convincing discourses were delivered by Elders Hart and others, and the  remarks of the bretheren were replet with words of encouragement and exhortation to the Saints, and I have no hesitancy in saying that we all felt much refreshed by partaking of the bread of  life there administered by the servants of God. Bro Wells introduced me to  Mr Majers, who happened to be present, of the company of Majors, Wardell and Russell, old freighters across the plains in the days of the Buchanan war. Mr Majers said that he knew my father well; perhaps you will remember him. Memorial services at the death of General Grant were held in the  Westminster Abbey on the fourth inst. where a number of our elders attended conspicuous among the American part of the congregation was Senator Edmonds, one of the wise men of the east, at least so says Chronicler.

Finaly the welcome sound rings out "all aboard for New Haven and Hartford". As the train procedes  up the banks of East River a beau- tiful panoramic view of changeing varrying hues of lights presents itself, presently the Harlem is croseed and we are speeding along the shore of Long Island Sound toards New Haven, where I leave the Boston Express and board a train bound for Northampton.

But I am quite cont- ented to live this way if it is nescess- ary that I should do so. It cost 12 shillings to go to London to the conf- erences held there.

We continue to push our labors in to the more isolated towns and vilages where for many years the sound of the Gospel has not ben herd heared to break the monotony of sectarian absurdites: Once in awhile an honest soul is added to the fold of Christ, but it is mighty slim gleaning and as a rule the people are reluctant to accept our test- imony or to investigate the principles for themselves, prefering to believe a lie and be damed with sectarianism than be saved  with "Mormonism" I am trying to "give all diligence to make my calling and election sure" I went to a circus yeasterday and got a good sixpense worth of amuseument This is the first entertainment of the kind I have ben to here.

I shall baptize two children before leaving. Bro Penrose has baptized two more in Whitchapel which makes five that have ben immersed there since I left, they are all members of a family that I visited a number of times and preached the Gospel to, so we see that Paul plants but Apolos waters.

They are built so as to form a perfect triangle leaving t a grassy open space in the centre and  it was here that I, after inviting the people held a meeting and talked to the people for forty five minutes and  at the close argued for another hour with three scripture readers who were disposed to misaprehend and asperse my motives but by the help of the Lord I was able to pin them tight which ever way they turned and finaly were compelled to invent some excuse for discontinueing the arguement and  slunk away like so many whiped puppies ENDENTRY a scare than any thing else but the old maxium "Its an ill wind that blows nobody good" proved true in this instance for the new companies reaped a rich harvest out of this molehill which they magnified to the size of "Mount Nebo" Bro Harsley has not ben enjoying very good health being troubled with his waterworks very badly; he said a few days since that he intended writing to you but whether he has done so or not I am not in a position to say.

Of course I perfectly understand your motive for so doing and I fully appreciate the kindly iterest you manifest in ENDENTRY cabs that were neare by. It is realy aston- ishing how soon falshoods will get spread abroad; there is an old saying and a true one that, a lie will travel ten leagues while truth is getting his boots on.

At the close of the meetings the Saints and elders had to be escorted to their homes by a ENDENTRY sideways text Asahel Sept 8 1885 Ansd Sept 27, 1885 end of sideways text  No 19 Sutherland St Pimlico London Sep 8 1885  Dear Father  I am now seated in the London office in company with Bros James Nye of Paris Barlake and St George who says that he left his home last spring, but only arrived in England last week, where he has ben in the meantime I do not know. Bro Penrose will be here shortly, he and I spent yeasterday afternoon at a Bro. Crasses living at Mt Pleasant Grays Inn Road, Clerkenwell, his health is good and he intends visiting Manchester next Sunday and the following week in company with D H Wells he goes to  Scandinavian branches. I wrot you you a few days ago but having received your letter  inserted later ^of Aug 16.^ since mailing that I now avail myself of this opportunity of transmitting an early reply to the same Dear Father you can not imagine what a world of good that letter has done me, and I feel much better in boddy as well as in mind than heretofore and am grateful indeed to you for the  excelent advise contained therein, it whispered peace to me, and  caused my heart to bound with joy to receive sutch lines of encouragment. The reason for my signing myself your unworthy son was because I felt self condemed for not  having had more determination than to give way to sutch gloomy feelings and be found complaining of my lot, no matter how hard and unpleasant, when I thought of how nobely you had carved your way through the obsticles suet in ENDENTRY Woodruff, about 22 years of age, who proved to be of great sevice to me during the day showing me around. A Mrs. Woodford was over visiting when I  went, but Aunt Lin (everyone calls her by this name here) invited her to go home and call another day, as she wanted to devote this one to me. I discovered this frank manner about  her in several ways before the day was over. She was thoughtful enough to enquire if I was hungry, and I gave her to understand most emphaticaly that I was having partaken of break- fast earley, yeasterday. She soon had prepared some delicious butter toast beef steak and coffee and it did taste fine after my long ride. Breakfast over Mr Hatch hitched Charlie into the cutter. While Aunt Lin muffeled me up in a big comforter and with Hattie as my fair guide, we proceded to visite the places of greatest intrest We drove first to the cemetry and dismounting dtied to horse up to the fence and ENDENTRY evening. The smallpox is very bad in this place at presend—cases being taken away every day or two. I did not receive your letter containing the photograph or should have mentioned it.

The family of Saints with whom I am staying while in Portsmouth have given me notice that I must get a room for my bed somewherelse in consequence of a prospective increase in the family which will necessitate their providing another bed. I dont know at present where I can go unless I hire a room amongst strangers and I dont want to do that if it can be avoided, none of the Saints in the branch are in a position to spare a room, but I suppose the Lord will open up a place somewere. It requres a good bit of money to travel in England now for if you sleep under a haystack you are almost sure to catch a cold and perhaps get run in for vagrancy, and if you have no money to buy food with you may go ENDENTRY Death and distruction throughout the land, those meetingings held in the city have ben held in mile-end- road and by St. Pancris Rail Way Stati^on^ and have ben well attended and as a rule orderly with the exception that occasionly a Reverend who fears that his craft is in danger has a put in but as his defense consists for the most part in spleen he is soon defeated in the eys of the intelligent part of our hearers. One night when holding an openair meeting alone I was attacted by a minister supported by a  number of coleagues but aften a long and warmly contested discussion which lasted untill eleven oclock I withdrew amidist the cheers of the  crowd for many of them said I whiped my opponent badly on every point Dear  Father it may be somewhat of a  surprize to you to heare that I am ENDENTRY just at the present time, but then there is not much use in crying over spilt milk, and I have ben very fortunate in this respect thus far. I received and answered your letter of Sept 1st returning your letter to Pres Penrose explaining why I did so at the same time. Your welcome messenger of Sept 16th came to hand yeast rday and was carefuly perused. I was pained to heare of the low condition of Ma Woodruff and sincerely hope that I may be permitted to see her and all of my kindred once more in the flesh.

It is early in the morning now and every thing is as still almost as the grave, and were it not for the stillness being occasionly broken by the incomprehensible shouts of a costermonger or the shrill crys of the news boy we might imagine ourselves far removed from the din and conflusion of smoky London. This is, in fact, a very quiet neighborhood as a rule being situated some distance above Milbank Prison a few hundred yards wide of the Thames At night time however it is infested by a good many fas woman of the most fashionable type as a great many of them reside in this neighborhood, but they seldom molest me; I suppose it is because I go along about my busines and let them alone. I have recieved letters from you baring dates April 17th, 21st and 30 also May 5th 11th and 17th but have not ben able to answer them all through not having the time at my disposal, having to attend as many as nine meetings in one week and seldom getting to bed before twelve or one oclock and sometimes later. In addition to meetings I am tracting in the daytime and spending my spare evenings at some strangers house when I can get the opportun^ity^ I may have ommited sometimes to state what letters I have received from you not having them with me, but do not think any have ben lost. The letter ENDENTRY turned gray and you would not convince them to the contrary, and indeed the time has fully arrived that was spoken of by Isiah when he said that darkness should cover the earth and gross darkness the minds of the people; they have heaped to themselves teachers having itching ears who have turned away their ears from the truth and they have ben led astray after fables. I am still holding a good many open air meetings but thus far to all humane appearances with but little if any success. Still I realize that it is my imperative duty to warn the people and that it will be woe unto me if I preach not the gospel, if it were not so  I should not be so often seen and  heard in the streets proclaiming that glad tidings of great joy; for realy there is no joy no satisfaction in preaching to sutch an indiferent ENDENTRY squad of policeman. Bro Wells did not venture out to the evening meeting as he for some reason, appeared to be the pincaple object of their hatred. One of the elders at L-pool is collec ting the portraits of all the elders in the mission for the purpose of send- ing to Copenhagen to have them all arranged on one card, each conference to be classed by it self, and will be a very nice thing when completed at a cost of 18 pence each. I am still doing some preaching in the open air and distributing tracts at the houses, but the prospects for converts areis vary a secure given. Rejection is to commonplace to be attractive and I think if there is one place more than another on this little earth of ours where  the people are in the dark in regard to religous matters it is here in Grays. Notwithstanding there is a chapel in nearly every street. After a long dry spell we were favored this morning with a regular old fashioned English rain.

Wheat is now quoted at 35 cents per bushel  and potatoes @ 20 cents. None of the banks have suspended though thing avalible cash is growing beautifuly less day by day. Business here in the store is gradualy drying up, people confining thin purchases to the bare necessities, which leaves everything not strictly staple on our hands,. People feel a littel more hopeful however owing to the improved tone in eastern markets. A house in East Waterlow just South of S. W.

A row of houses belonging to Wm Butterworth of the Sixth ward was destroyed by fire the same night Tramps are becoming very numberous in our neighbor- hood lately.

Your Affectionate Son  A. H. Woodruff ENDENTRY your pathway through life. The report about my coming home refered to by Nellie in her letter was to the effect that a number of the young men were to be sent home this  fall to make room for a certain class of missionaries which are known here as gentile missionaries in conse quence as it is in consequences of the gentile incluence being brought to bare upon them that we are favored with their presence in this country, but I disremember having said anything farther from which she might infeer that I was expecting to return home this fall. Nevertheless I am quite agreeable to come home and help take care of mother and  family and do what I can to assist in your matters there Your letter addressed to Bro. Jones arrived safely  and was handed to Pres. Penrose ^who^ considered your proposition as proper under the circumstances and sent it forward to Pres.

WILLIAM TAYLOR, PROPRIETOR  entered this sacred spot, proceding  up the centre walk we soon found Grand Mother Woodruff's resting places with the toomb stones faceing West. I recognized them in a  moment from the photos which you  have of them. It would be difficult to  describe the feeling which came over me as I gazed upon this halowed resting places of my long since departed kindred and thought that perhaps you had stood on the same spot many years before. It may have been the cold that caused my eys to moisten. this is a delightful spot at sutch as one could wish to rest in till called forth to a brighter existence an iron fence surrounds the yard and a row of splendid pine's cast their approving shadows upon this matchless home of the dead.

But dear father dont think that I wish to complain far from it, for I am enjoying my labors as well as could be expected with sutch discourageing success and the unsettled conditions of things at home. There are about forty members in this district all told but about one half of them are on the fence and the other half are scatterd from Dan to Barsheba. The Queen came to Portsmouth last night and went on board her yacht. She leavs for Germany this morning The approaches to the Dock Yard were lined with anxious spectators eager to get a glimpse of her majesty (myself among the number) through the car window as her train passed by and a sigh of disapointment ascended from the throng when after waiting for more than 30 minutes She passed by in a closed carriage, and baffled and crestfallen the crowd dispersed. Consider- able excitement prevails here in millitary circles owing to the crittical conditions of things on the Afghan frontier. Englishmen are confident of their ability to give the Russian Bear another thrashing if necessary and the seem eager for the fray.

My duties in the Whitechapple branch are more that I can bare up und- er and if followd up would land me in the insane asylum or some other charitable institution. My pbrain has become so feverish with the continual strain upon it that I scarcely now what a moments peace of mind is, so this morning I went and laid my case before Pres. Penrose and told him he would be cofvering a grea favor by moving me into the country somewhere as I considered it wanted a person of more mature experiance to fill my place. He was sory to lose me from London but would do as I requested, so I am going down to Grays opposite Gravesen to try and create a little excitement there It is about twenty miles from ENDENTRY death have succeded in scattering the  members of our family, and no doubt on my return I shall find that the old home is not what it used to be, same with whom I was familiar will have gone to  that sleep that knows no waking, others that were want to do will no longer contribute their smiles toards the sun- shine of my life, some of them I hope to  meet beyond the grave in our Fathers kingdom. I long to see you dear father more now than ever before in my life and hope to be able to do so in the near future if the Lord will. Mother has not sent me the money yet. It appears that she did not understand that I wanted the money untill I sent for it again. I have written lately requesting her to send me some at once to New York as it will not have time to reach me in England. The  telegram you refer to purporting to give an account of a mammoth conference held  in London is entirely false for no conf erence was held in September, and the ENDENTRY written to Bro. Penrose was handed to him and he was greatly pleased to hear from you. You say I  must not get discouraged if I do not get filled with the Holy Ghost and the Spirite of Revelation but to be satisfied if I can enjoy enough of it to enable me to preach the Gospel. Well Father that is all I  want and would be very thankfull if I could enjoy it to that extent (but when a fellow gets up and makes an ass of himself a few times he is apt to loose or sutch an experiance is not calculated to inspire him with a spirite of meakness. It m^a^y be wrong for me to talk this way but it is fearful hard work for me to preach the Gospel and more particularly to the Saints). I feel much better when standing before  a congregation in the street proclaiming the first principles of the Gospel in their ears; perhaps I under rate my own abilities at least, so thinks Pres. Penrose and he said while talking to some parties the other day about ^me^ it, that he never heard me open my mouth but what I said something. Well says I every one does that! No they donte says he some people will talk for hours and not say anything but you always say some- thing. This of course was encouraging coming from the source that it did, (and it is possible that I depreci- ate myself too much) There is one thing certain and that is there is no danger of my getting puffed up in the pride of my heart. My great ambition is to fulfill my mission with honor and to be able to return ENDENTRY Sept 5th 1887.  Elder A. K. Thurber South Scituate, Rhode Island  Dear Brother,  Your very interesting letter of Aug. 28th has been received and read with much interest. We are glad that you were kindly received by your aged Parents,  It certainly must have been a happy meeting with you all. Your journey must have been interesting to you through the South as well as through the North. Your visit to your fathers family, we think was quite timely, as you were enabled to gather a valuable store of information concerning the genealogy of your father.  We are pleased with your expression of the public sentiment concerning Utah Statehood, that the public spirit is in favor of it. I have never seen as good a prospect for Statehood as at the present time. We have much to encourage us to labor for that object.  You speaking of the religion of the day, It is true ENDENTRY class of people, unless it is in knowledge that we are doing the will of God, and if we grow not weary ^(of well doing)^ and faint not we shall reap our reward. Ours it is to preach and proclaim the message to the people, and theirs it is to accept or reject it. I continue to prosecute my labors with unceasing dilligence because I feel  it is my duty to do so, but I can-not go at it with that view and avidity that I should like to. I seem to have no faith in being able to bring any one to a knowledge of the truth what little faith I once possessed has nearly ben crushed out by repeated rebuffs, still Mormonism is true, this is my testimony but there is something wrong with me for surely if the Lord was pleased with my labors he would crown my efforts with some success. I say it deliberately, and not in a bo^a^stfull spirite either, that there are but few elders if any ^(in the Mission)^ who have done more preaching ENDENTRY we quit this place, but not before  gathering a bit of evergreen from one  of the graves. our next call is at the Allen place of which I am content with an external view. proceding  some distance farther east on this  road we turn to the south and pass the old juddge place which is somewhat dilapidated and unoccupied at present. And now comes the most interesting experience of all the visite to the old Old Mill and your birthplace. We tied our horse at the mill and got out of the sleigh. Two brothers named Hohnes are running the placed. One of them we found raking ice out of the race, so the water could reach the wheel which is situated at the  back of the highest part as shown in the  photography. the water is carried to it by means of an 18 inch inclined wooden pipe, the upper end of which connects with the old race as it stood when  you left it half a century ago. I entered ENDENTRY Sept 3rd 1887  Elder B. H. Schettler Dear Brother:  Will you do me the favor to tell me what there is due in my note in the Bank for Stock? The original note was for $60000.  I paid interest on it for awhile. I wish to know what interest is due together with the principle, and as I have $300.00 in the Bank is there any interest due me on that amount, if so, how much? I wish to know how much is required to pay my note besides what I have in the Bank.  Direct to W. Woodruff, care of James Jack at the President's Office.  And oblige Your Brother,  Wilford Woodruff ENDENTRY September 1st 1887  Mrs Mary Campbell,  Salt Lake City.  Dear Sister: I received your letter of the 29th and in reply will say that I should be pleased to have an interview with you if circumstances were so that I could; but I spend my time mostly in the country and not located in the City. My circum- stances are such that I cannot make any appoint- ment in the City with any certainty. I will say I made out a balance sheet of all my accounts with your husband's Estate, which is in the hands of Judge Elias A. Smith. I would advise you to consult with him about your affairs. My circumstances are such that I will not be able to take any further ENDENTRY the city down the Thames. I will come into London about once per month. I will be amongst stran- gers almost entirely and will be under the nescessity of hiring a room to sleep in as there is no accomodation for a elder there. Of course the comforts of body will not be much but what are the comforts of body compared to the peace of mind, they dwindle into insignificance. I hope you will not take an uneasin- ess on my account for I will man- age to pull through it somehow My desirers are still to do good and hope that the Lord will make me instrumental in his hands of pointing some to the higher law in this  new field. The fruits of my labors are begining to be made manifest in Whitechapple as a number have expressed their intention of entering ENDENTRY entire story is made out of whole cloth I should like to have a good gun and  be with you a few days in the bull-rushes duck hunting and perhaps my wildest dreams in this respect will be realized if I have  an opportunity of paying you a visite.

One week last Sunday morning I went and heard Spurgeon preach in his tabernacle and I preached twice myself in  the afternoon and evening.

Good by and  God bless you Your loving Son Asahel ENDENTRY home satisfied within myself, and my earnest desire is that I might have more of the Spirite of the Lord to aid me in attaining these ends (Why I can not enjoy my labors better is more than I can tell, the reason  for my being deprived of the comforting influence of the Holy Ghost is not because I have commited myself in any way whatever, God being my witness, was it  the result of any act of mine I should have remai- ned silent in regard to the matter. No! this is not the cause and what it is the Lord only knows. Pardon me if any thing herein contained grieves you I was constrained to say so much) From the "News" It appears that things are not looking much brighter at home, but methinks it will not be long before  the clouds will clear away and the blue sky once more appear above. I see a few of the weak kneed and limber backed are willing to bow and cringe and suplicate at the feet of a tyranical judge, but the majority prefere to remain true to their God at all hazards. It seems hard that people should be persecuted in a land of eaquel rights for worship^ing^ God according to the dictates of their own concience There is sutch a thing — and this world will find it out some day to its cost — there is sutch a thing as suffering for rightousness sake. I suppose this is one of the mediums by which the Lord will bring about the purification of his Saints. This is not a  struggle betwen a few thousand people in Utah and ENDENTRY alone in the streets than I have and many times I would sooner have taken a good horse-whipping than done it, but all this would be joyfully endured if only the Spirite of the Lord would dwell with me to comfort me and support me in times of trial so far as deriving spiritual benefit is concerned my mission has ben a partial failure at least, and I think my whole life is a failure. I sacrifis- ed the object of all my natural affect- tions and the only girl that could have made me happy in this life, It was my own fault that she proved false to me because of the coldness of my letters. I acted as I did in that  matter thinking that the Lord might be displeased with that alliance, and hoping that by disolving it I might get an increased portion of his spirite but alas my hopes were vain and  now at times my life is truly ENDENTRY that darkness covers the earth and gross darkness the people, as the Lord has said, and Light has come into the world in our day and man loves darkness rather than light because their deeds are evil, and you going out of Zion into the world this will be more notice- able by you than it would otherwise be.  Now concerning myself. I will say I heard of the death of President Taylor the night after I left you at Bartholomews. a messenger arrived from Gunnison gave the news just as I was  going to bed. I did not sleep much that night, next day we drove 40 miles to Nephi. I there met  Brother A. H. Hyde and we took the cars to Salt Lake.  I spent the day at the office, saw the body of Prest.  Taylor in the evening, and saw the procession next day as it past the office, there were 102 vehicles  and 7 Bands of Music. I spent the next three weeks in the City and a good deal of the time in council.  I have been blessed and got along very well. We have been united in our labors. Brothers Cannon and Smith have taken their places in the quorum and we are all working harmoniously together. My health is good. All the quorum are together in council except Elders Brigham Young.

My dear Sir:  Having at last reached success in the passage through Congress of the bill admitting Utah to Statehood, it is due to you to know something of the more important details of the long and difficult contest. The victory which has been reached has come only through the help of friends whose services can never be forgotten, and through a  patience and persistence of effort which I have never seen equalled. Indeed, in this contest have been found nearly all the experiences of effort and resistance, of fidel- ity as against conspiracy, of loyalty to friends as against temptation, and truly all the experiences nearly that make up the struggles in human life and effort. Coming into it at a comparatively late stage, and having passed through before many noted contests, and not having the intense feeling of the struggle for home and independence that you and your people have felt after so many long and weary years of waiting, I  have naturally been able to judge more impartially of the struggle, of the work of the people who have figured in it, of the unworthiness of those who have failed in fidelity, and of the debt of gratitude that all of you must forever owe to those who have stood in the storm, and through the stress and trial of years overcoming every obstacle, foiling every treachery, have brought you triumph at last. In my observation of your people and my analysis of their character I should judge that they are peculiarly en- dowed with the qualities of appreciation and gratitude. It has been a long and bitter  school in which they have been taught the value of friendship, and the withering, bitter, unrelenting force of enmity. It is difficult even now to see, as in a few years it will be impossible for any fair man to see, how remorselessly and persistently prejudice and malice have followed you and your people in the crusade of over a generation against you. As intelligent and Christian people, however, you have that quality which is the most divine in human nature, the quality of forgiveness; and as I have watched this  struggle year after year and seen how strangely things have come out, how your enemies ENDENTRY as I am no placed in a position where I shall have to study unceasingly in order to be enabled to enunciate the principles of High Heaven intelligently and advisedly; there will be no danger of my growing rusty through disuse but it will be impossible for me to satisfy myself or discharge the duties incumbent upon me acceptabely before God without his divine aid and assistance and I am determined to take a course to secure to myself a greater portion of that Holy Spirite than I have hitherto ben in possession of, even if I have to fast two or three days to accomplish it If there is any virtue in fasting I am going to find it out, for to be frank the spirite of my calling has not yet arrested upon me ^as^ I should desire; that is it is not my constant companion it comes and goes, but it is my determination to draw nearer to God if possible and ENDENTRY Salt Lake City May 2, 1898  Sister Susa Young Gates  I received your Letter of April 27, And in reply will say in answering your question, concerning my Mother ^she^ Died with the spotted fever in Avon in ^A.

In regard to my health I will say that my lungs keep in splendid condition but my general health is not the best and my constitution seems to be considerabely weakened there is not that life and vigor about me there used to be in fact the life a missionary has to lead in some of these districts will test any ones strength but London will probabely be better—not the atmosphere but the living. The Saints here are so poor that they have to live principleely on bread and butter and a little fish occasionly.

All of us as we grow older learn to value more and more highly the gifts that come to us through dis- cipline, and it is a strange part of human life that nearly everything that is dearest to us, most to be treasured, and most preservative of our liberty, comes to us dearly bought by suffering, sacrifice, and often longtime oppression. Nearly everything dear to human life has been gained along these high lines, where human endurance has been tested, where character and patience have been put to bitter test, and where all that is  good and noble in a people has been developed under storm and trial. Neither in this generation nor in any soon to come will the strange blessing of final independence which has come to you and your people be fully understood. But for the spirit that drove you into the wilderness to combat with the savage elements among men and the more savage elements of nature, but for the necessity of industry, courage and patience, made necess- ary by your battle for life in a country so wild and unfruitful at first as to be un- friendly, but for the strange experiences through which practically the first two genera- tions of your people have passed, your Church would never have been rooted and grounded in the everlasting strength which I believe it now holds, and the strong men you have developed would never have been discovered to you. So it may come out at last that a  Providence has been in it all, a Providence apparently unfriendly for many years, but with the final proof that it was a loving Providence in the care of you all the time. Yours will be a very fortunate people as time shall come and different generations shall  follow, if those who come after you shall prove as worthy, as true to everything that is right in human life and aspiration, as courabgeous in the performance of duty, as the  strong and fearless men and women who first set up the standard of your Church in Utah and who so loyally and fearlessly upheld it in the first generations of your experience in the Rocky mountains:  While I never was among the American people who are intolerant toward the ENDENTRY learn more fully of his ways that I may be enabled to walk in his paths -- the paths of light.

Dear Brother: Your kind and very interesting communication of Feb. 23rd reached us on March 19th. We were pleased to learn of the continued growth of the Church, and of the progress you are making in the printing of the Book of  Mormon. Your request for $500.00 to help you meet your engagements with the printers was duly considered by the Council of the Apostles, and in the present straitened condition of the finances of the Church, it was decided that the utmost we could do was to send you the amount you ask—$500.00—as a loan. We have accordingly arranged that the amount be forwarded as desired by you, through the Union Bank of Australia at Auckland. We have also sent to Brother Marriott the £10.0.0 due him.  Among the Elders called for New Zealand was Elder George- town. His health was, however, so poor that when he reached San Francisco with the other brethren it was considered advisable for him to return, which he did ENDENTRY assisting the Elders. The London Conference is about 38 pounds behind with no imm- ediate prospects of ammeleorating its con- dition. I am pleased from reading the minutes of the YMMIA Conference to learn that they have passed resolutions to  withold all patronage from those people who take a part in or in any way befriend the present crusade against their parents and friends—this action is very commendable on their part.

Dear Brother: It was with great pleasure that we read your communication of April 11th.  We have much joy in the progress of the work of the Lord in the lands where you have charge; and we believe that the publication of the Book of Mormon in the native tongue will have a highly beneficial effect among the natives. Yiour course in reporting to them your receipts and expenditures will also greatly add to the good feeling of the Saints.  The Maoris have evidently had their confi- dence shaken by the methods of sectarian missionaries in financial matters. We msust do our utmost to build up confidence in their hearts towards us, that they may not only know that the Lord has revealed His gospel in these last days and made us its ministers, but also that is fruits are manifested in our lives, and that we have learned that all men are the sons of God and should be treated as  brethren in all the relationships of life.  We are pleased also to discover that you are establishing sunday scholols ENDENTRY state through this probation to its final abode in the presence of God.

We were all enjoying the hospitality of Bro Crass of North London last night-- I say night because the greater portion of us stayed up all night in consequence of which I am a little blinky to day We had an interesting entertainment to which each one of us contributed, thus having a jolley good time together. A number of us are going to visite some places of interest to day. Miss Quayle and I have had a final separation, I have returned her letters and feel as if a great weight was removed from my shoulders, and am free. I do not regret this termination of so unfortunate an alliance. Good by and may God protect and keep you in his holy keeping, is the constant prayer of your Affectionate Son  Asahel H Woodruff ENDENTRY Mormon Church, being of a liberal and tolerant mind, and having acquaintances with the section of the Mormon Church located in Iowa, made up of as good people as we had in that State, of course I never knew or had opportunity to know fully and distinctly all the facts in regard to the career of your Church and people in Utah and the contiguous western States. It was some ten years ago that in connection with Mr. Blaine, when we  were studying the elements of voters in the United States to try to secure a majority for the political principles in which we believed, I first learned of the magnitude of the Mormon people, the greatness of their development in many States besides Utah, and  the large part that they were sure to bear for good or evil in the destiny of this re- public. Mr. Blaine and I were both surprised to see with what far-seeing wisdom the pioneers of your people had looked into the future and had laid the lines along which your descendants were to play a large part in the affairs of this country. Ever after that both of us realized both how unjustly you had been dealt with in the past and what a strong call there was upon the conscience of every lover of his country to endeavor to see that you were dealt with more justly in the future. It was in this way, led by my natural sense of justice and by my knowledge and by my realization of the wisdom  necessary to deal with all the composite elements making up the people of our country, and my early recognition of the industry, patience, and good purpose of your people, that I came to take so much interest in your welfare and became so willing to aid in relieving you as much as possible of the wrongs inflicted on you in the past and to secure to you a full share of rights as American citizens in the future.  It was in 1889 that the matter was projected before me so prominently, and at a time when I was in such position as to have some official power in addition to my personal influence, and fortunate enough to be near Mr. Blaine with his almost omni- potent influence, that I took up in zealous manner the effort to serve you to the extent of my ability. It was in this time that Colonel Trumbo, who has proved such a friend to your people as I have never known any people to have, came upon the scene, and gave to Mr. Blaine and to me such a practical and accurate knowledge of your exact situation as to wrongs in the past and rights in the future, that we were enabled thereafter to ENDENTRY PRESIDENT'S OFFICE,  Salt Lake City, Utah, Sept. 17, 1888.  President W. Paxman,  Dear Brother:  We wrote you by last mail but, being exceedingly busy at the time, did not answer the two questions you asked in your favor of the 3rd of July with regard to tracts and the emigration of our Maori converts.  We shall send you an assortment of tracts by the Elders who next go to your field, and trust that by their means you will be able to accomplish much good.  Respecting the emigration of the Maoris to this land, we feel led to say that for the present you had better repress any inclination of that character. If the work among the Pacific Islanders continues some provision will doubtless have to be made for their future colonization and development. It is not improbable that we shall be able to arrange after a while for some suitable place in a milder climate than ours, a climate the seasons of which would be like their own, and where it will not cost so much to live as it does in our own northern land.  The Sandwich Islanders are moving here in small numbers; but their position is not such as is best adapted for their growth in those disrections that are desirable. ENDENTRY organize and conduct a contest in your behalf on lines that we knew were absolutely right and as absolutely sure to win for you in the end. Of course, I need not say to you, or to any of your people, how devotedly and wisely Colonel Trumbo over several years has subordinated his own interests in life and made your interests the ambition and as- piration of his every effort, and how with apparently more than human energy he has de- voted every day and every thought of his life to your service. It has been almost en- tirely through his influence, through the genius of his persistence in carrying the story of your wrongs and rights to the door of nearly every influential man in the nation, of his energy in assembling all these influences, and making friends for you wherever there were good hearts to make friends with, that success has finally come to you. I have been  much in politics, and in many struggles. I have seen many successful men, gifted with masterful and even peculiar powers in human affairs; but, as Mr. Blaine and I have often talked and discussed, such a character as Colonel Trumbo, with his ability to make friends, his ability to make people listen as to your wrongs and his power to convince them of  your rights, and his singular quality of assembling all these forces together, whether represented in the public press, or in the organizations of the different churches, or the more powerful influences of the most powerful corporations, and finally in the seat of supreme power in the United States, Congress, has never before appeared on the scene of American politics. It is not in my nature as a devout man and a believer in higher powers, to reject the idea that he has been given for this work even more than the strength of a man. It is refreshing in this age of cynicism and indifference in the world to find friendship of this higher sort sacrificing personal interest and ambition to a good cause and putting the success of that cause above everything else. Equally marked and equally beautiful and worthy of admiration as Colonel Trumbo's persistent and remarkable efforts in your behalf has been the unselfishness of his actions, the subordination of self with no expectation of reward except the great joy of seeing justice brought to you and your people at last. That you and all your people will appreciate this, that you have no confidence too sacred to be given to him, that there is no honor within your control too high to be offered him, that your children after you ENDENTRY 2  They are employed as workmen in various occupations; but we think they should be in communities where they can receive better advantages and be able to pay some at- tention to the cultivation of the soil. We shall keep this matter before us, be- cause it is one that we are already questioned upon by Brother Joseph H. Dean, who has attained some success in preaching to the natives of the Samoan Islands, where he and his Sandwich Islands. The prospects there for con- versions are very encouraging, and the steamer that carries this letter will con- vey three Elders and the wife of one of them to the Samoan group, they having been sent for by Brother Dean to assist him in his labors there.  In line with this counsel, we think it would not be a wise movement for Brother Marriott to bring the young Maori sister of whom you speak, as it might unsettle the people and make them desirous also of emigrating.  By the next steamer we expect the following brethren will sail for your field of labor: Latimus O. Taft of Matthias Fos- ter of Meadow. By the November vessel two others will follow; they will probably be American Fork. On the October boat there will probably also leave George Edwin Wool- ley of this City. Unless other arrangements are deemed desirable between now and the sailing of that steamer they will on their arrival labor among the friends and ENDENTRY 2  very reluctantly, as he was exceedingly anxious to honorably fill his mission. Since he reached home we have deemed it wisdom to entirely release him, on account of his poor health, and have encouraged him to the performance of those duties which he can perform in the midst of the saints without imperiling his life by the changes and hardships of a foreign mission.  Have you any suitable Elder or Elders now with you whom you can recommend to succeed you when you are released to return home, or do you think it will be necessary or desirable that some Elder specially called to preside in Aus- tralasia be sent from here?  We are anticipating a largely attended and very enjoyable General Conference. For the first time in several years the majority of the General Authorities of the Church will, in all probability, be present. Myself, Elders Lorenzo Snow,  John W. Taylor and F. M. Lyman may be released from the penitentiary in time to be present during the last day's ser- vices. Presiding Bishops Winder will also be with us. We hope to be able during the Conference to attend to several matters of importance connected with the growth and development of the work of the Lord.  The day after Conference will be a busy one with us. About sixty Elders will be set apart on foreign missions, principally to Scandinavia,  ENDENTRY 3  relatives of Brother Australia. When Brother B. gets through minister- ing to his friends he will most likely return, and Brother Woolley will be subject to your instructions as to his future labors. Should Brother Bromley not find it convenient to go Brother Woolley will report to you for instructions on his arrival the same as the other brethren.  This morning Brother George Q. Cannon went to the Third District Court, surrendered himself and plead guilty to two charges of unlawful cohabitation. For a long time past he has felt strongly impressed that good to the work of the Lord and to his brethren would result from such a course. He has been impressed that his surrender would be followed by the lightening of the burdens now imposed upon the Saints. Thus far his anticipations have proven correct. The Judge acted with justice and moderation, not only in his case but in these that followed. You may naturally suppose that his act of Brother Cannon's caused a sensation, and the course of Chief Justice Sanford has not decreased the excitement. The great ma- jority feel that both have done well, the rabid few are intensely angry. Should  the Judge continue his moderate course, I am of the opinion that other prominent men will follow Brother Cannon's example, as it is most desirable for the growth of the kingdom and the good of the Saints that the leaders of Israel should have  free access to the people to counsel, instruct and teach them as in former days. We have reason to believe that Brother Cannon will be treated with kindness by ENDENTRY shall be taught to know the value of his services, I am sure from what I know of the Mormon character will be true.  The story of the struggle of your people, as a people, and the later story of the struggle of your Territory for Statehood, are both so interesting and absorbing that it is hard to confine any analysis of it to anything like the proper limits and space of a letter. But I feel it is due to you, who have been remote from nearly all the phases of these struggles in the eastern States and out of your own Territory, to be told by someone who has known of them and who can make the recital impartial something of the details, to be left in your records in a form that will endure as a part of the history of your Church and people. I take it up here with the attempt to disfranchise your people in Congress in 1889, when a bill was introduced to add this further indignity to the cruelties and wrongs of the Poland Act. It was then that Colonel Trumbo appealed to me for help, feeling that I as a western man, as a man who had tolerance of opinion, and especially as a man who was then in an official position of power, could help him in resisting this further visitation of wrong upon you. He and I craved of Mr. Blaine the use of his far greater power in your protection, and with his help we went before the committee of Congress having this proposition of further wrong before it, and were able to defeat it. If you could have the words, which seemed almost to be the words of inspiration, as they fell from the lips of Mr. Blaine, protesting against this further wrong to you, protesting against such an outrage upon any portion of a free people, asserting that no republic of free men could tolerate such a wrong and li^v^e, I am certain that they would be treasured in the affections of your Church and people as being only second in comfort and power to the words of divine speech. I have always regretted that no report was ever made of his appeal to that committee. It came up suddenly, was very informal, no one thought of anything but what Mr. Blaine was saying, and he spoke so deeply from the heart and from the best thoughts that ever arise from the human soul, that his words came almost unconsciously to him and he was never able to repeat them. I asked him afterwards if he could not, and he said that they seemed to come to him as if on wings at a great and critical time, and they had passed away as suddenly and com- ENDENTRY 3  pennsylvania. On the same day the first Convention of the Officers and Teachers of our Church schools will be held, to consider matters connected with the organization and conduct of our Academies. The progress made since the General Church School Board was organized has been very encouraging. Twenty Church institutions of learning are running, with an attendance, during the past winter, of about fifteen hundred scholars; and we do not think we overestimate when we say that double that number of schools will be in operation the next school year. There is scarcely a Stake but what has one or more schools now open, or is arranging to commence next August. The chief difficulty that, at present, presents itself is the lack of suitable breth- ren to act as Principals. Where they are all coming from is the question that we cannot now answer, but when the time comes that they are needed, we doubt not but, as in other things, the Lord will raise up men to accomplish this portion of His work.  We are patiently waiting for the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in our appeal against the escheatment of Church property under the pro- visions of the Edmunds-Tucker law. We expected it before this, but have been disappointed. There is a miserable scramble going on in Washington for the Utah Offices. The "ring" here are working for the re-instatement of Judge Zane, and ENDENTRY in the branches wherever practicable.  The fact that you have twenty-five such schools now in active operation in New Zealand tells its own tale, and affords us much encouragement with regard to the future of the Maori Saints.  These institu- tions should be carefully nurtured, that the children of the native brethren and  sisters may early learn the truths of the gospel, and the false traditions and superstitions of their ancestors be thereby so much lessened in influence in their after lives.  We cannot give you any other counsel with regard to the emigration of the natives than we have hitherto done.  We do not regard the present as an oppor- tune time for such a movement.  Their childlike and confiding natures would un- doubtedly be terribly shocked by things that they would now-a-days see and hear in the midst of the Saints.  They must learn to abide in patience until the time when the Lord signifies that some change should be made in our present instructions. Encourage them to live their religion, and the Lord will accomplish all His purposes with regard to them in His own time and in His own way.  We should be pleased to have you take whatever measures you and the Elders deem wise and prudent to counteract the organized efforts of the ministers of the various denominations to injure your influence and impede your labors amongst the natives.  Show, wherever you have opportunity, how they have progressed in true civilization since your advent among them; that they are more virtuous, more ENDENTRY 4  the officials of the Penitentiary, and allowed such privileges as are consistent with prison rules.  With constant prayers for yourself and those associated with you,  I am, as ever,  Your Brother,  Wilford Woodruff ENDENTRY pletely, and there was left to him only the memory of his indignation at the wrong proposed and of his duty to resist to the highest limit of his power such wrong and encroachment. Of course, your people know something of the courage and loyalty of Mr. Blaine towards you in oppression; but the summit and sublimity of it all was reached when he stood in this small committee room and smote down with the giant strength of his indignant wrath this further attempt in a free government to degrade still further a people already wronged too much. If you but knew the burning words with which he spoke, the spirit with which he spoke, I am sure that the name of Blaine would never pass Mormon lips without the blessing of a prayer following the spoken word or the unspoken thought.  This marked the limit of the high tide against the Mormon people in Congress. Wrong had gone as far as it was possible for it in its malice to go. From that day it receded. Having curbed it in Congress, then it became necessary to spread out the feeling represented by Mr. Blaine over this wide nation and mollify all the great ele- ments into something of the same feeling—nearly all of which, sharing in a preju- dice and a hatred which were the more intense because of their ignorance of the facts, were almost implacable at the mere mention of the name of Mormon. Religious intoler- ance far outruns political intolerance, as you know; and, having checked the highest tide of this feeling in political circles, it then became necessary in a government of the people to go back to the sources of all the powers of Congress and mollify all the great elements toward the final and ^end^ which has now come. In surveying the field Mr. Blaine, Colonel Trumbo, and myself felt that the next step was to secure, first a  larger tolerance in the Republican party, and finally the active friendship of that party in behalf of justice to your people and Statehood for your Territory. It had been the fate of this party, driven forward by the crusade of the churches against your Church, to be in possession of the government and therefore to enact and enforce the laws that public sentiment coerced from Congress in enactment against your people in some of your practices as a church. The first practical step to be taken along this line was to take away from the so-called Liberal party in Utah, which had always been ENDENTRY 4  the appointment of such men as McBride, Idaho) to other offices. Their hope is to get men into position to steal Salt Lake City and Ogden at the last election. Some accounts represent President Harrison as quite prejudiced on our question, others speak more favorably. We have hopes that he will not appoint local men to fill the various U. S. offices in the Territory; at any rate, that he will not select men such as those proposed by our enemies.  March has been a pleasant, warm and showery month, and the prospects for water in some parts of the Territory during the coming summer are slightly improved But as a general thing the amount of snow stored in the mountains is below the average.  My health and that of the brethren associated with me is generally good, and no contagious diseases prevail, to any extent, among the people.  Praying the Lord to continually bless you and all the Elders laboring with you, that all your efforts may be crowned with success, and with love and kindest regards,  I remain your Brother in the Gospel,  W Woodruff ENDENTRY sober, more cleanly, more industrious, and in every way better citizens since they listened to the teachings of the "Mormon" missionaries. You can vindicate your calling and labors by the fruits that have followed, and prove that your efforts have been as priaiseworthy as the truths that you teach are impregnable.  As we hoped, the United States Washington has reversed the decision of the local courts in the case of Brother Hans Nielsen, taken up on co- habitation with a polygamous wife, then for adultery. The Supreme Court holds that two separate crimes were not committed by his living with a plural wife, and sent down an order ordering the discharge of Brother Nielsen from the penitentiary. He had served his term for unlawful cohabitation and was serving out the one for adultery. We understand that Preosecuting Attorney Peters and some other officials are much chagrined at this decision. They had hoped to introduce the segregating system in a niew and very odious form. Now they must elect which charge they will proceed on. No doubt, wherever the evidence makes it possible, they will proceed against the brethren for adultery, as the penalty, on conviction, is so much the heavier. Arrests for the infractions of the Edmunds-Tucker law are still frequent in the remoter portions of the Territory, but not so numerous as at one time. It is said that there are at present more Territorial prisoners in the Utah penitentiary thayn at any former time. The number of United States prisoners is less than it was ENDENTRY more an engine of injustice and oppression toward you than a representative party of just sentiment, and which had finally become simply a means of persecution and money- making, the apparent sanction of acting in the name of the Republican party of the nation. To do this efficiently it was necessary to dispossess this Utah Liberal party of its membership in the Republican National Committee, and to give admission instead  to the Republican party in Utah, and thus to gain entrance of the national party on the local ground, where it could deal in justice and fairness with your people and take up with intelligence the preliminaries of the final settlement which has now come in fair- ness to you. To those of you who were remote and who know little of the national pre- judice and of the difficulty of assembling the support of every State in a National Committee, this may have seemed a trivial matter. I happened to be Chairman of the Republican National Committee at the time, and even I, who knew much of this prejudice,  was surprised to find how obstinately the most of the members of the Committee held to the old-time prejudice and how timid nearly all of them were as against the reproaches of their people for rejecting the Liberal party in Utah and admitting to membership in the National Committee a party that proposed tolerance and fair play to the Mormons the same as all other Americans. It took a year of patient effort, of direct personal appeal to almost every member of the National Committee, and more than that of system- atic work to reach the influences back of these men personally, to give them the courage to act along the line that we proposed. It happened that the meeting of the National Committee where Utah for the first time was admitted to fair-play representa- tion in any National Committee was held in Washington, where all the allied influences against your people had their representatives on the ground for action. These influ- ences stormed at the Committee, frightened away all but the most resolute men, and made it extremely difficult to carry the matter successfully through the Committee. But it was finally done, and when it was done the Liberal party of Utah was for the first time cut off from connection with the supreme sources of national power. Colonel Trumbo may sometime when he is with you, in the confidence that exists between you and in the great affection in which he holds you, give you many of the details of that first struggle, ENDENTRY some time since. The total number is now 211; at one time it reached 252.  President Utah. He has appointed a new Governor and Secretary and two new members of the Utah Commis- sion. Our new Governor is Mr. Arthur L. Thomas, once Secretary of the Territory,  and more lately one of our Commissioners; the Secretary is Col. Sells, a lumber merchant of Salt Lake City. The removal of Commissioner Thomas and the resignation  of Judge Carlton made two vacancies in the Board. These the President has filled and the Commission now consists of Messrs. Robertson and Nebraska. The two Democratic members are Messrs. McClernand and Williams; though Mr. Williams shows very little true democratic principle in his dealings with Utah and her people.  There has been much apprehension felt throughout this region that water for irrigation would be very scarce during the coming summer, and as a result the crops would be exceedingly light. But these fears have been set at rest by abundant rains in the valleys and snows in the mountains during the present month. Already, in Salt Lake City, nearly two inches more rain than the average has fallen since the commencement of May. In some neighboring valleys the differ- ence has been even greater. As a consequence of so much rain and snow, the weather is cooler than usual at this time of the year. In April—before the stiorm came— it was considerably warmer than the average. ENDENTRY which may seem trivial now but which was the first necessary step toward success at all.  In thus helping to strike down the Liberal party by the hand of the official national power of the Republican party, I gave assurance to almost every Republican of influence and prominence in the nation, and to everyone whose help I finally succeeded in gaining, that despite of the past, when Republicanism and Mormonism were made to stand as deadly elements of opposition, the future would be one of fair play and one in which your people would act on the lines of the future and not of the past. There was the natural fear, of course, after the Republican party had enacted and enforced the severe laws against Utah, that there would be treasured up in the hearts of your people the natural feelings of enmity and revenge common to human nature. Utilizing all the  facts Colonel Trumbo had given me, and nearly always having him with me to bear testi- mony to what I was saying and to answer every question that might be asked, I succeeded in convincing enough Republican leaders to control the majority of the party that the future Mormons, all of them instinct^lled^ with patriotism and love of country, all of them believing in protection to American interests and industries, and all of them animated by the common purpose of all Americans to serve the republic in its government of free- dom faithfully, would be found and indeed would be forced by their own destiny as a people to gravitate toward the underlying principles of Republicanism and Americanism. The question was a mighty one, and nearly every prominent man to whom I talked when I revealed to him the fact that this was not merely a Utah question but that the Mormon people were spread through the valleys of eight or ten western States, and that sooner or later they would hold the balance of power in the election of every Senator and of every electoral vote for President in these States, was apalled at the fact and afraid to trust to the forbearance of a people who had been so severely dealt with as a people by the Republican party. I mention these things, which were the foundations on which I laid our efforts to change the Republican party from being a party of opposition to your people to one of friendship and support, that you may know how deeply the founda- tions have been laid and that you may understand the expectation and confidence with which the Republican party has come up so bravely at last to the line of doing justice ENDENTRY As requested by you, we have directed that a draft for £90.0.0, on the Union Bank of A. L. Stewart, H. J. Burgess.  To recur again to the question of the emigration of the Maoris, we find ourselves perplexed as to what arrangement to make for the Sandwich Islanders who have emigrated to this city. There is quite a large number of them now here, and the mode of life here is not suited to their proper training, and we have felt very much exercised for their welfare. Three of the brethren who have labored among them on the H. H. Cluff—have been appointed, with three native brethren, to examine various locations that would be suitable for them to settle upon. We desire to have them separated, to some extent at least, from the temptations of city life, where they can be trained to better advantage than they can here. If we find a suitable place, they will move there; and we may find it necessary to appoint one or two Elders who are familiar with the language to labor among them. When we have disposed of this question in a successful manner, we can then perhaps take into consideration the question of moving the Maoris also. They are kindred races, and the course that will be taken with the Sandwich Islanders can also be adopted for them.  We feel that you should be released from your mission. You have ENDENTRY toward you all.  After this step in the National Committee, the next important chapter was to overcome the prejudice existing with President Harrison and the influences almost uni- versally exerted upon him, a man of peculiar religious prejudices and particularly open to the appeals of the more intolerant Churches, and induce him to follow out the per- mission of the law and the demands of justice and issue amnesty to all your people. This was not dealing with one man, as may appear on the surface. If it had been, and that man of the tenacious and obstinate character of this President, even that would have been a  great struggle. But we had to go back of him, and reach all the more intolerant Churches, all the church papers, and lay a mollifying hand upon them and their prejudices, and take upon our lips the words of Christian peace and gospel and appeal to them that, even granting all they said against your people, there was everything in the teaching of the Christian religion, when you had turned away from all things to which they objected, had conformed to the law, and had as a Church under the revelation of the higher power to which you conformed put away all these things, they should take you by the hand even according to their own teaching and make you welcome with them and to equal rights in the republic. We had to see and bring influence to bear on all the church papers; we had to see the bishops and controlling men in all the strong Churches, especially the Catholic and the Methodist. The Catholic, it is only just to say, was more inclined to the new rule of fair play to you, while the Methodist Church was most tenaciously against it. I was sent by the National Committee during the campaign of 1892 to renew the talk I had already had at several times with the President in appealing to him to issue the procla- mation of amnesty. He said that amnesity meant so much that for him to issue it was to make an end of all the contest, that if it were done at all it should be an amnesity complete and final and reaching all people who had come under the offense of the law, and that to do this during a campaign, when he was a candidate for reelection, would be considered by the prejudiced people among the Churches as an act influenced more by his needs and ambition as a candidate than by his sense of justice and duty as a President. He said that he feared all the church papers would oppose the act and condemn the pro- ENDENTRY performed a lengthy and faithful mission, and we do not think it wise to have you continue there any longer. But before you leave we desire you to appoint one of the Elders to take charge of the Mission, and notify us who it will be. We hear Brother Angus T. Wright very well spoken of, and the brethren generally who know him think he would be a very suitable Elder to take charge of the Mission when you leave. If your views agree with ours, then you are at liberty to appoint him and transfer the business of the Mission to him. Set him apart to preside before you leave, and then you can return as soon as you feel led to do so.  Two of us—Presidents Woodruff and Cannon—returned a day or two ago from a vnisit to the Sanpete Stake Conference. We had a very enjoyable time and  held ten meetings during our absence, one of which was at Nephi. We saw your son there and other members of your family, and they were in good health; and while in Sanpete we met your returned child, and were very glad to see her. She was in good spirits and health, as well as the baby.  We havo just got word that Judge Zane has been re-appointed Chief Justice of the Territory. This, we hoped, would not occur, and have done what we could to prevent it. It has not been our wish, nor for want of any exertion of ours against him, that he has received the appointment. But the Lord will control his acts for His glory and, no doubt, for our salvation; so we accept it with resig- nation.

ENDENTRY clamation, and he required that I should have all the editors of these papers seen, and that I should test all the sources of power among the leading religious denomin- ations. When you realize how many there are of these papers and how numberous are the sources of religious power and authority, you can imagine something of the task that he laid upon me. It was then that Colonel Trumbo came on to help in this work, and we were fortunate enough also to have the benefit of the wise counsel and suggestion of Presi- dent New York and remained several weeks, a fact which in itself was peculiarly fortunate and almost providential in the line of success to our efforts. Difficult as this work was, we took it up, em- ploying the help of many people, and finally secured a favorable expression from all the church papers in favor of showing confidence toward your people in their changed atti- tudes, and quite a favorable expression from leading church authorities in favor of the President's immediate and favorable action. The amnesty therefore would have been iss- ued in October except for the affliction that feel^ll^ upon the President in the illness and final death of his wife, when to the credit of his heart be it said everything else even the campaign for his reelection, was made subordinate to his duties toward his dy- ing wife. Influences counter to our wishes intruded on this effort from Mr. Elkins, then Secretary of War, ^and for some strange reason from General Tracy, then Secretary of the Navy,^ the latter being influenced, I think, through some unrelenting leading men in his Church, the Presbyterian. Mr. Elkins I think wanted to reach some understanding with the authorities of your Church in behalf of some friends and inter- ests he has in New Mexico. As you know, the amnesty was finally issued after the elec- tion, and this act of a Republican President following the sanction and permission of the laws of a Republican Congress put great power in our hands to influence all Repub- lican elements in the contest to follow.  Then followed the contest for Statehood, in the winter of 1892-3. In prepar ing for this we reached out and with systematic effort organized into friendly influ- ences still more all the powerful elements of every State, by reaching the State Com- mittees of our party, getting them in active line of friendship in their influence on Congress, together with the members for each State of the National Committee. We also kept up through the summer of 1892 our active efforts in mollifying all the strong ele ENDENTRY ments of the party and of the Churches, and especially of the newspapers, the latter be- ing the power that men in Congress fear more than any other, for they depend on their home papers to keep them right before their people and in public favor. I should not omit to state somewhere in this letter, and here may do as well, the constant efforts of Colonel Trumbo while all these things were going on, and his success in assembling strong influences to accomplish it, in securing favorable action toward your people and Church in the Department of Justice and the other Departments here where confiscation of property and other outrages had been perpetrated or attempted. One of these was the debts imposed by the Poland Act, amounting to nearly a million of dollars, which he was thus able to save you from. Of course, these things you know as well as I; only I have felt that reference should be made to them in this letter, which perhaps, with the papers accompanying it, will be the most detailed statement put into written form of the strug- gles of your people to emerge from the outrages of Congressional law, to escape penal- ties laid upon you with so much injustice, and the final struggle of your Territory into Statehood. Of course, I commit this letter to such purpose through you in the confidence that grows up between men who heart to heart have made a struggle against the mightiest of opposition in a common desire for success. I deal frankly with men, revealing to you friends who are worthy of your remembrance and gratitude and also under a sense of duty mentioning those who failed in the time of your need to support you with friendship and met you with enmity and opposition instead. I do not believe in treasuring up even  a sense of wrong, nor nursing resentment, nor entailing revenge. Human nature is too weak, the grave too near, the necessity for forgiveness too apparent, for these things to be. They only dwarf those who entertain and exercise them, and make them appear in something of competition and likeness with those from whose meanness they have suffered. But I do believe that every man and every people should know and should remember through time and generation the difference between those who win friends and those who win en- emies.  There are some facts in connection with the struggle here in the winter of 1892-3 that should be made known to you in the deep confidence of this letter, and for ENDENTRY you to use your judgment in making known to others in authority with you, and the actual facts of friendship and enmity. Trumbo the ad- mission of Utah to Statehood through a Republican Congress. Through our system of effort, through the assembling of influences reaching into every State of the Union and almost every neighborhood, reaching into the Churches, into business elements and corporations, we succeeded in getting the bill through the House and in gaining practically a unani- mous vote in the Senate, and were defeated only by the persistence of the Chairman of the Territorial Committee, who, finding himself finally almost if not entirely alone in his Committee in opposition to Utah, appealed to that thing called courtesy in the Senate in order to defeat what had become practically the unanimous desire of the Senate, an appeal in which he went so fare as to threaten to resign as Chairman if the majority of the Committee should overrule him and favorably report the bill. We have never fully ascertained, although we are satisfied that we know, the influences that acted upon him.  They came from Utah, from the Liberal party, whose leaders never abated any of their efforts to defeat our endeavors, and who I am satisfied have never relinquished their secret opposition up to the present hour. As you have already been informed, we went so far and came so near success that through Senator Allison, who was Chairman of the Com- mittee on Appropriations and who has been, I may say here, one of our most faithful and powerful friends throughout the contest, as to succeed in getting the gate open on the floor for Utah to be called in from the Committee at two different times in the Senate during the absence of Mr. Platt. Colonel Trumbo and I had arranged with Senator Allison in his committee room to go down and give the floor to Senator Carey. Each time the Senator left us he said, "When I come back I will bring you the news that Utah is a State." He did get the chance, but for some reason Senator Carey did not get in in time and when the gap was opened other men jumped in and utilized the opportunity. I have  studied over this matter and investigated it a great deal, and I am satisfied finally that Senator Carey erred in these matters only from lack of quickness of action. He is  a loyal man, and I am now satisfied has intended to be true to your people, and has failed only where celerity of movement, quickness of brain and ale^r^tness of attention were ENDENTRY needed. We are pretty well satisfied now, after a whole year of investigation, that the influences that acted upon Senator Platt to hold him in opposition, even after we had secured every Church and political element who had acted with him before to appeal to him  to be favorable then, came from Goodwin, and that it was secretly exerted through Senator Idaho. We shall finally discover all the facts, for it is well enoughf to know even after a campaign has been fought, in guarding gainst similar occurrences in the future, all the facts in regard to treachery as well as fidelity. I am fully satisfied that Utah would have been admitted by the Republican Congress in February of 1893, except for the influence exerted upon Senator Platt, who alone defeated it then through Senator Dubois. This impression has been confirmed by the indifference and lack of earnestness of the same Senator in the contest of this winter and spring. There can be no possible reason to excuse Senator Dubois against this  act of justice toward Utah and its people. He had lived in a Territory where the wrongs against the people were merely a tithe of those against your people, and had suffered from them and knew what they were. He had also received, even after he had been your open and violent enemy, the strange and disarming thing of forgiveness and magnanimity and support. He was bound by all reasons of honor that govern in the hearts of good men to forget a past where your people had never wronged him, and after you had forgiven and forgotten it to become a faithful friend. We have means by which we shall finally ascer- tain the exact truths in regard to his action and his certain attitude. Meantime I would not wish you and your people to go so far as to share my positive impression that he was the successful enemy against you last year, and that he has been, if not an active enemy this year, at least an indifferent friend. You are making history, and with that high sense of justice which e^a^nimates all your actions as a Church and a people you will insist upon knowing the whole truth before expressing judgment. We shall be able within a year to give you these facts.  This winter and summer Senator Platt proved to be one of our best friends, wisest counsellers, and most potential influences.  I should have stated earlier in this communication more of the names of the men ENDENTRY among the leaders in the Republican party who early identified themselves with this movement and have as constantly served in it loyally ever since. Among the most promin- ent Quay, who until we took the matter up with him and caused him to see the truth was amongst your most persistent opponents. For two years, however, he has used all his great power and influence in your behalf. Ex-Senator Thomas C. Platt of New York, who is in many respects the most powerful man in the Republican party and who wields an unusual power in the business elements of the country, was among the earliest, and has not only served with friendship and influence but helped the Colonel and me in raising the means necessary to pay the expenses of the many difficult works and systems we had to carry out—works which required the employment of very many people, all for purely honorable purposes and yet for purposes which required personal visits to every considerable community in the nation. Mr. Manley, of the National Committee, Mr.  New Jersey, all also of the National Committee and among its most powerful members, Mr. Wisconsin member of the Committee, Mr. Washington, who brought into line nearly all the elements of that portion of the country, Secretary Rusk, now dead, who was always active and always friendly, Archbishop Ireland of St. Paul, of the Catholic Church, Cardinal Louisiana, who has helped us very greatly in dealing with Southern elements, Mr. George M. Pullman, and Mr. Runnells, his General Counsel, who helped us very much with the large business ele- ments and corporations, Hon. Pittsburgh, Ex-Chairman of the National Com- mittee, General Michigan, who has been exceeedingly active among great corporations and in church circles as well as political, Governor McKinley and Ex-Governor Ohio, who have proved friendly at all times and active in their friendship, New England, who has been aboth active in help and liberal in means and has drawn into it in help many of the strongest and wealthiest men of New England, Hon. Washington, who has served us with peculiar ability and fidelity, Hon. Minnesota, and many others I might name and perhaps ought to name, have been as devoted friends as any ENDENTRY people ever had. These are elements, as you will notice, outside of Congress. In Con- gress we had at the start the powerful help of Senator Allison, who was then the most influential Republican in the United States Senate, and Speaker Reed of the House, these two men furnishing out the most of the power we have utilized on the Republican side in Congress. When Congress was Republican these were our leaders and main helpers.  This brings us down to the expiration of the Republican Congress on the 4th of March. It is well enough to express again, with sufficient emphasis to make it endure, that it was in the heart and intention of that Republican Congress to make Utah a State. Ninety-nine out of every hundred of the Republicans in Congress favored this, the Repub- lican President desired it, the Republicans in the House did their part towards it, the Republicans in the Senate stood ready to do it, and the whole gracious act of Republican intention was defeated only by the strange influence exerted upon the Republican Chair- man of the Senate Territorial Committee, an influence exerted from your enemies in Utah in some strange and secret and yet sufficient manner. It is well enought^f^, and I think fair enough, that you and all your people should understand that the Republican party as a party in Congress and in executive power desired and intended to give you Statehood.  It was only through that strange thing and its stranger power called courtesy in the Senate that your disappearing enemies in Utah were able through the exercise of peculiar power over one Senator holding a place of peculiar advantage, that this Republican inten- tion was defeated. Let me say here clearly and plainly that this influence, whatever it was, was not one of corrupt character, for no man ever lived who was further above cor- rupt things than Senator Platt. In some way I think this malign influence in Utah exer- cised through some Republican Senators from that region an influence on Senator Platt, making him believe that it was necessary to defeat Statehood and that the sole reliance for this necessity was on him.  This brings us to March, 1893. During the summer of 1893 we kept in constant motion all the influences through the organizations of friends we had perfected in every State in the Union, not only to hold the turning tide toward friendship for you among all the controlling elements of the nation, but if possible to increase this feeling into  friendship. We had able and strong and controlling friends at every influential church gathering, all the Methodist conferences, and all the synods and associations of the dif- ENDENTRY ferent Churches held during the summer. All the time we had felt that the coercion of church sentiment over men in Congress was the thing to be feared, for religious in- tolerance is always last to release its grasp. We succeeded well and increased our chance among these controlling elements during the summer; and this brings us to the assem- bling of the Democratic Congress in December. During the extra session in the summer, called by the President to meet the financial situation, our question played no part. And when Congress met in December, Democratic in both branches, with a Democratic Pres- ident, our situation had become irritated against us with the Democrats by the results of the various State elections held in that year, including the one in Utah, where your people had elected a Republican Legislature. Nothing during the whole time in which I had been engaged in this movement has made the difficulty of it so plain as when it was demonstrated that we had to go to a Democratic Congress, with the traditional intoler- ance of the Democratic party against Republican communities and Republican interests, and ask it to make a State of a Republican Territory. ENDENTRY This danger was heightened by the fact that the Democrats held their power in the Senate by a slight majority, a majority sure to be decreased in some of the States electing Senators this year and in especial peril against the probability of Republicanism when Utah is admitted. It was our fortune and salvation in this dilemma that we had been able in five years of constant effort to gain the friendship of the Republican party general- ly, and to have it mobilized in such hearty manner that it was willing to play any part of honor necessary to success. But it became necessary, of course, not only to gain Dem- ocratic support for Utah, which had gone Republican, but to make the Republican friend- ship and support as unobjectionable to the Democrats as possible and as unobtrusive as possible. The Democratic party is wise always in its generation. They were not deceived as to the Republican Legislature in Utah, nor could they be deceived, with the Wilson Bill taking the profit of protection from everything raised on Utah ground or from under Utah ground, of the tendency its people would naturally have in politics hereafter. There is no doubt that it was the settled Democratic program in December not to admit Utah, but it is also just as certain that as a party it intended to shirk the responsi- bility for this and by tactics leave the responsibility on the Republicans. It was then that the wisdom of our organized Republican strength was made apparent. The Utah bill was brought into the House in December from the Democratic Committee, not with the in- tention of passing it, but with the expectation and settled belief that it could be used in tactics to Democratic advantage on the confident faith that the Republicans would  oppose and filibuster against it. It was brought in with the evident intention to shut out and occupy the time desired by Republicans to defeat other Democratic measures. How- ever, when it did come this expectation was disappointed. The Republicans by following a splendid strategy under the leadership of Mr. Reed politely informed the confident Democracy that instead of opposing Utah or filibustering against it they were friendly to the people of Utah and in favor of admitting the Territory to Statehood. The bDempo- crats had gone too far, they could not recede, and therefore the bill passed—another strange evidence in this unanimity of both political powers that something higher than ENDENTRY human power and wisdom has been in this matter for its guidance from the first. No one could have believed that in the same House where for so many years the name of Utah and the word Mormon had been used to excite bitter contests, and where the Democrats always  stood to challenge the Republicans for their course towards Utah, the time had come when both parties would act together as one man to admit it as a State. There is a blessing in this for the State and its people, I am sure. Before leaving the question of its passage in the House, I should say that in addition to Mr. Reed, whose powerful friend- ship was so valuable, we had also the benefit of the almost equally powerful influence of Mr. Babcock of Iowa, and indeed of every one of the stronger men among the Republican leaders. The only speeches made in opposition were by Mr. Massachusetts whose opposition was a help, and Mr. Ohio, whose intolerance of speech simply emphasized  the need for national sense and action.  The bill therefore went from the House to the Senate bearing the invincible approval of unamimouss passage. Here the Democrats were placed in a dilemma. They still professed to hold in cordial degree the same friendship that they undoubtedly had toward Utah and its people in previous years, notably such men as Senator West Vir- ginia, Senator Texas. They assured us, since they saw no chance of escaping and since they plainly saw they could not defeat Utah without putting it on the ground of objection to the Mormons and without thereby forfeiting the friendship of the Mormon balance of power in several States, that they would pass it and give you Statehood for the holidays. But they did not meand it. They intended to hide it away in the Committe, to keep it in the background, claiming that they were still in- terested in it but that the absorbing question of the tariff bill had relegated that and everything else of comparatively minor importance to the rear. Thus 1893 was concluded and 1894 began. We saw very plainly that unless we could use in some way the passing chances of the current contests in the Senate and be of service to one faction in the Democratic party as against the other, we could not win. For it was both the party in- ENDENTRY tention and interest not to admit to Statehood a Territory whose two Senators would be Republican and change the balance of power in the Senate. In addition to this, some of the most powerful men in the Senate were opposed personally to the admission of I should have said further back in this letter that all the time one of the most powerful elements we have had to contend against was the eastern prejudice against the admission of any more western States, and especially of any more silver States. The gold people of the East realize the danger to them of more power going to the West and to the silver States. We have had constantly to combat this influence, especially amongst all New England Members of Congress, both House and Senate, and all the Hill of New York, the  most powerful Democrat in the Senate, came here in deadly hostility to the admission of Utah or any more western States, and sought a place on the Territorial Committee in order to make his opposition effective and in order more securely to guard the East against what they considered the danger of the admission of more silver States and Senators. In furtherance of this program of Senator Hill's he also had himself placed upon the sub- committee of the Territorial Committee, together with Chairman Platt Faulkner a former undoubted friend but changed into secret opposition by the secret or- ders of his party, and the latter the longtime enemy of Utah who the Democrats supposed would continue that enmity and who could be used as a public scapegoat for the secret Democratic opposition. Senator Gorman, the most influential Democratic members of the Senate and the guardian of the party's interest, was also actuated by this fear and be- lief that Utah would be Republican, and also by the eastern prejudice against western or silver States. We found also as events developed not only this prejudice amongst the eastern or gold States, but also a still more dangerous prejudice in the southern States against the admission of any more western Territories on the ground that they would become northern States and therefore help to decrease the power of the South. Thus we had the dangerous opposition of the mercenary interests of all the eastern States and of the political ambition of all the southern States, which, as you know, are so covetous of power for the South in the government. In the face of the develop- ENDENTRY to defeat the nomination of Mr. Hornblower. Before doing so we secured the pledges of  honor of Mr. Utah. But for this opportunity we should have stood no show whatever, despite of all the powerful influences we had assembled, to pass Utah into Statehood in this Congress. On the second fight, over the nomination of Peckham, these gentlemen again appealed to us and we again organized a line and gave them success. This increased their gratitude. Mr. Hill from the first day changed about and has been our active, willing friend at any call on our part and at every opportunity he could see himself to serve us. Mr. Gorman did not come so promptly up to the fulfilment of his promise and kept wishing to post- pone fulfilment until after the tariff bill. Indeed, it is certain that he went so far with his power as Chairman of the Caucus Committee of the Senate, and therefore the dictator of his party in the Senate, to instruct Senator Faulkner, Chairman of the Territorial Committee, to keep the bill in that Committee and out of the Senate. Mean- time we had been organizing our forces, and found a splendid ally in Senator White of California, who has been from the first everything as loyal and helpful and vigilant  in your interest as he could have been if he had been a citizen of Utah and one of your own people. He has had not only this friendship but he is a man of remarkable re- sources, of experience in legislation, of determination in purpose, and peculiar facil- ity for such work. He had rendered you a service your people can never fully repay. While waiting on Senator Faulkner's movements, who kep^t^ delaying even a meeting of the Committee to consider Utah and who kept going to West Virginia on days that had been appointed for that purpose, and who employed every sort of tactics to keep us defeated and yet in a good humor, we kept strengthening our lines in the Senate and also in the Committee. Afther they exhausted all their excuses for the non-action of the Committee they began to lay the whole blame on Senator Platt, who was the principal Republican on the Committee. Senator Platt had still retained his opposition up to this time, despite of our bringint^g^ to bear upon him the united influence of the party and many powerful influences in State. Finally he resented the idea of being made responsible for what was in reality the secret Democratic program of non-action, ENDENTRY and Utah because it was a western State without alienating from the support of the protectionists in the Senate such western men as Senator Stewart and some others. He was too manly to bear off the sins of the secret Democratic purpose, and was too mindful of the interests of the East to help break the protection line or let any Republican Senator vote for the Wilson  or free-trade bill. Finally he came out flat-footed, declared himself for Utah's ad- mission, and wrote Senator Faulkner a letter that he was in favor of admission and that as a member of the sub-committee of the Territorial Committee for Utah he was ready to report favorably. This broke the line, and with Senators Call, Demo- cratic members of the Committee, favorable, and under the leadership of Seantor Hans- brough, a Republican member of the Committee whose services I should have mentioned earlier, we were able to stampede a favorable report from the Committee to the Senate. This surprised the Democratic line again by tactics the same as we had surprised it by the passage of the bill in the House. After it was out of the Committee and on the calendar of the Senate it was not longer possible for the Democrats to defeat it except by open opposition. I should have said at the outset of our program in the Senate we found in Senator Hansbrough of North Dakota as valuable and helpful a fir^ri^end as we have found any place in this contest. In conjunction with Senator Allison, who as an older Senator had that acquired power which is peculiar to the Senate, and acting on his suggestions, he has been our active and working friend and reliance in the Senate. A member of the Committee, a western man who had lived in California and other western States, exceedingly popular in manner and influential and respected by all who know him, he was labored day by day and constantly in our behalf, not only in the Senate and in the Committee, but coming almost every night to our rooms to help lay our plans and programs. Many of the most valuable suggestions have come from him in making the fight. I want you and your people to know that you never can owe more to any man outside of your own people than to Senator Hansbrough. He is a young man, in his first term in the Senate, but sure to be returned and to become one of the most powerful members of  this exalted body, so that his friendship in the future will be as valuable as it has ENDENTRY been in the past.  The contest in the Senate has been one of such detail, changing every day and frequently every hour in such strange manner, that it is impossible for me to recite it to you with anything like fidelity here. Suffice it to say that it has been such a peculiar situation that we have never been able to leave the ground. Colonel Trumbo and I have remained here since November and devoted ourselves entirely to an alert, vigilant, constant watchfulness of the situation, ready to detect danger at the first moment or to utilize an advantage at every opportunity. We have had to enter into nearly every contest unknown to the public to serve this or that friend or to gain the friendship of this or that element. We have built up our work as a stone- mason a wall, stone by stone, laying our hopes in solid mortar and rearing a solid structure on which we felt, despite of the opinion of nearly everybody else and in- deed of all the experienced men in Congress, that we should win at last. We have had in Senators Hansbrough and in other Senators in less degree, constant watchfulness and service. On the Democratic side Senators Hill have been supreme in help. It has taken the wisdom of many men to win this difficult fight. Among others I should mention that Mr. R. C. Kerens, whom I have already mentioned, member of the National Committee from Missouri, has come on and spent weeks of his time in our service. He is a friend to remember, for he has been both useful and  faithful. ^I wish I might give you too the names of all our faithful friends.^ Indeed, you can take the Republican roll call, and I may say of it that two thirds of the names represent loyal and active friends and the other third men who have been borought to friendship through influence and conscience. The same may be said of the mass of the Democratic Senators, who when the situation had to be faced faced it on the side of manliness and justice and voted on the right side despite of their party's interest and their own secret party desire to keep the Terri- tory out because it was Republican.  There is another and more delicate matter, which I have confided to General Clawson, who has been here with us and whose counsel and vigilance have been in the  highest degree valuable, and whose courage and cheerfulness have furnished strength and confidence to both of us; and he will confide it to you. These means, used for ENDENTRY purely honorable purposes and yet for necessary things, were raised entirely from Repub- lican sources because of friendship for your Territory and your people and because of confident faith that the Territory was to be identified with Republican policies and  ambitions. This help has come freely, has been used wisely, and without it success could not possibly have been achieved. It has been used with as much honor and to as good re- sults as conscience could suggest or honesty require.  In closing this letter, which is so long that I fear it may weary you but yet which I could not make shorter and which indeed I might have made longer under my sense of fidelity to all the friends we have found, I am constrained by such a sense of appre- ciation as I have never been called upon to feel before, to refer again to the strangely loyal and successful and splendid service which over long years and in the face of every obstacle and against impediments which would have dismayed any other man I have evenr known, Colonel Trumbo has served you and your people. It has been beautiful to me to see such a friendship possible in the human heart. His ambition for your people, his deter- mination to lift them up out of wrong into victory, to compensate them for the injustice they have suffered, to make them known to all the American people for their honesty of character and their purity of good intentions, and the dedication of his life to the end of making the Mormon name as honorable and as accepted in honor in the sight of every high minded American, have renewed my faith in human nature. It has inspired my own heart to see how he has been actuated also by loving friendship and devotion to you. No son whom I have ever known could be more loyal, and no son I have ever known has served  a father as well as he has served you. It has been, as he has constantly said to me, not only his ambition to accomplish this desired vindication for your people, but also to accomplish it in your time and under your Presidency, while you were still the shepherd of your people and the hope of all our hearts.  Whatever appreciation you shall show to him, whatever honor you may offer to him, it will be deserved. In addition to the gratitude you shall forever owe him, I  feel it as a sense of duty to you as well as to myself, and to the pledges I have every- where made, to say that I think he should be sent on your own motion as one of the men ENDENTRY to represent you in the United States Senate. No other man could possibly represent you to your benefit and to your vindication as he can. No dozen men nor any hundred men among you are as well known as he is to the powerful and controlling men not only in Con- gress in this later time, but throughout the country. You know, and this is realized probably more by President Cannon than any other member of your people, that experience and acquaintance are necessary in a Congressman or Senator to serve his people fully and faithfully. If Colonel Trumbo had been a member of the Senate ten years he could not have  gained more acquaintance and friendship to your advantage than he has gained now. Uni- versally the people of the country and the people in Congress look to him as representa- tive of Utah. This fact of itself is sufficient for my position. The friendships he has formed, the acquaintance he has gained with the most powerful elements of the country, will all be in your service. Besides, no one else will ever know and therefore no one else could ever redeem as he can, the thousands and thousands of obligations that we have incurred in this long contest in your behalf. He knows many things that none of you will ever know, and yet things that a people or a State can no more afford to forget or fail to fulfill than any man of honor. I feel my own honor involved in the representation of the State of Utah in Congress. This whole matter has been on my conscience as nothing in my public life has ever been. I was the first to take up in detail the position taken by Mr. Blaine, and the first to carry it to the attention of the Republican leaders in detail, and the first to organize and assemble all the party influences in your behalf.  Very much of the action taken by others has been taken on my assurance of honor that I was not being misled, that yours were a people in whom faith could safely be placed, and that your destiny as a people and a State ran in the same grooves with Republican pol- icies, Republican patriotism and Republican interest. I shall feel that I am on the bond, that my honor stands for guaranty, and therefore that I am at liberty, and indeed con- strained by the highest sense of duty that can actuate an honorable man, to make known to you the obligations which rest upon you in these sacred regards.  I ought to say also, and will say in brief, that we have carried in parallel with our contest for Statehood the material interests of Utah, that we have never for- gotten the industrial and social ambitions of your people, that we have brought to the ENDENTRY attention of everybody with whom we have come in contact the empire of natural wealth and resources and industrial possibilities in your borders, and your ambition as a  people and a Church to develop a community which will be an example of American in- telligence and merit and conservative of the highest average good to every citizen, and  always regardful of all true interests of the republic. The railroad enterprise has been in some degree a backbone in our endeavors. This enterprise can be carried for- ward and can be made the means not only of fulfilling many obligations that we have in- curred to many prominent men whose help has been vital, but also of gaining to your State their personal interest and valuable friendship. It is the destiny of your State to parallel the career of the most prosperou^s^ States in the Union, prosperous in a  material sense and ranking highest in the noblest senses. Since I have become identi- fied in sympathy with your people and your ambition the possibilities of Utah have con- stantly grown upon me, and I shall find much of my future life I am sure involved with your people and your ambitions. Here occurs to me something I ought to have said earl- ier, and that is that in securing the help of many of the most powerful elements which have come to our assistance I have not only given assurance that there will be no cause for dissatisfaction with the men who shall come to represent the State of Utah in Con- gress, but that the elements of discord in your Territory will be pacified or removed.  I know it is in your ambition as a people to make your ways by peaceful methods, and  this is the high duty of all leaders of men and of all associations of Christian people.  The arch enemy of your Territory and your people has been a newspaper, ably edited, almost satanic in its ingenuity for mischief, relentless and cruel, and ever sure to remain an element of harm and injury if left to its present control. I have given the assurance that this will be changed, and I have done this confident in the action I  represented faithfully the wisdom and fidelity of your intentions. I think this prop- erty should be purchased, and I have pledged that it shall be representative of Repub- lican policies, and I am willing to take it up in connection with such people as you may assign and help to organize it or do anything in the matter which the common interest may suggest or your people desire. The necessity for control of this engine of good or ENDENTRY evil is heightened by the fact that such people after defeat are capable of nothing but bitterness and desire for revenge. While it can never control again, it can always make mischief, it can always be a subject of annoyance and an element of discontent. There ought to be no trouble in securing it, for the men who control it are actuated only by mercenary interests and therefore are open to negotiation and arrangement.  There is another suggestion that I feel that I ought to make to you in view  of correcting evil impressions in regard to Mormonism and its people in all that wider world outside of New York, and in both would be better still, should you in some way secure the friendship of an influentail news- paper in each of the great political parties of the country. To me, while I have been in five or six years canvassing this subject with the people of every State in the Union and with people of all shades of opinion and degrees of intelligence, it has been sim- ply astonishing that such dense ignorance as well as such malicious prejudice exists everywhere in regard to the real fiber and actual character and purpose of your people. We have been exceedingly fortunate in our general arrangements and in our effort to systematize and mobilize all the strong and controlling elements in your favor, in reaching the influential newspapers of the political parties, as well as of the Churches. After this I fear many of these publications will naturally lapse into the old-time feeling, and offer nothing by way of resistance to the prevailing prejudice against you, nor by way of enlightenment of the public in regard to your actual merits and ambitions as a community and a people. Undoubtedly the plowing that we have done in every influ- ential community of the nation will yield good things to you constantly hereafter; but it is very important in my judgment that you have in one or both of the great commercial centers of the country such friendship on the part of one or two strong newspapers as will at all times, without appearing to be special pleadsers for or special champions of you, defend you against false accusation, and gradually give to all the American people the actual facts in regard to the Mormon Church and its good purposes, to the Mormon people with their refinement and education, their love of gentle things in life, their artistic development, their ambition to rear their children and their States in all the ENDENTRY finer things of life, and their aspiration indeed to make themselves fully the equal of any American in every test and accomplishment of civilization and refinement, as well as of Christianity. I shall find it my pleasure, as I have already done in large measure, to keep supplying to the magazines, to the houses printing syndicate letters, and all other diffusive agents, such information as will tend to correct the false impressions existing in this country in regard to the degree of intelligence and the measures of am- bition of your people. In the magazines you will have a hearing that will be internation^-^ al as well, and along these high lines of publications read by all the more intelligent people of the world constant effort to render to you all actual justice on your merits will be advisable. As I have before suggested, I think, in a letter to President Cannon, a book written in comprehensive manner by someone having the historical quality of anal- ysis and the judicial quality of fairness and some one not a Mormon, ought to be written and printed, giving to the world the facts as to the Mormons of today and what they are  and aim to be in every feature and respect.  In reading over my letter after having progessed this far, I notice that I have omitted any mention, in the hurry of writing, of the one man who through the long period of your years of trial has stood by you more faithfully than any other public man outside of your own people. I refer to Senator Colorado, who has been a tower of strength to you in all the crises of your career, and who has stood in the Senate and  acted throughout the nation whenever called upon to do so with all his power in your sufficient defense. No public man of today stands higher in the respect of the American people than Senator Teller, and his record for sincerity, his approved statesmanship, which has stood the test of many contests, have all been of wonderful and saving help to you in the last year, and especially in these nervous months of the contest before the present Democratic Congress. I need not multiply to you, however, any words of commendation of this spendid man, for he was deep in your hearts and affections even before you knew of me, and once there will always remain with abiding appreciation.  Neither do I wish to leave the impression that I fear I might have done if I  left this letter with no further reference to the good work done in your behalf by influ- ENDENTRY ential Democrats in this Congress. Mr. Rawlins, your Delegate, has been faithful, capable earnest and vigilant, and has done all that could have been expected of him, and is en- titled to your gratitude and praise. In the House, such Democrats as Mr. Calif- ornia, Mr. Wheeler, Chairman of the Territor- ial Committee, and many others who might be mentioned, and in the Senate such Democratic leaders as Mr. Arkansas, have constantly rendered good and very valuable service. I am satisfied that if the settled purpose of the Demo- cratic leaders at one time to deny sStatehood in some secret manner or in such way as to leave the blame on the Republicans had been carried into the field of open attempt, leav- ing us to call upon the Republican leaders to force the bill to a passage, we could have carried a solid Republican line in both houses, and enought Democrats of good faith and fairness would have voted with us to carry the bill. Indeed, if it should come that President Cleveland should veto the bill, I have faith that we could pass it over him with a solid Republican line and enought from the Democratic side to give us the necessary two thirds. But so far as we can learn up to this time, President Cleveland is ready to sign the bill. His expressions have been favorable, his views are very broad, and his own in- tentions I have no doubt are all favorable to the measure. The only danger in that source lies in the secret influence that may be exerted upon him from the eastern States and the gold people of the eastern States, to which influences he is peculiarly susceptible, and to the influence of Democratic leaders from sSouthern States, who are opposed to any more northern States. Yet Colonel Trumbo is confident that through the President's favorable disposition, and with the help of Attorney General Carlisle and Sec- retary Morton, he can gain the coveted Presidential approval.  The delay put upon you by the terms of the bill, in postponing the realizations of Statehood practically until 1896, were unavoidable. Without these provisions it would not have been possible to pass the bill without endangering it at the White House. The solid Republican line in the Senate wanted to amend these features, and we could have passed the bill as they desired it, but it was not advisable to give any partisan color to it nor afford any partisan reason for Mr. Cleveland to disapprove it. We have carried ENDENTRY things from the first along the line of the aspiration to make it unanimous, to tran- quilize all the elements, and to bring Utah into the Union a welcome member of the fam- ily and welcomed by all elements. Things have moved in a mysterious way to this end, and the devout may well think that the hand of God has controlled in it, bringing a blessing for all time with it.  I hope to visit Utah within a short time, and renew with you and your people the pleasant acquaintance of heretofore, and in the freedom of such interview talk over this great struggle and bring to your attention and knowledge many things which no doubt you and your colleagues will be glad to know. In conclusion I wish to express my own great personal sense of satisfaction that I was permitted to bear a part in this diffi- cult struggle in a noble cause. It has been with increasing pleasure that I have found in every year, and almost in the developments of every day, my faith in your people con- firmed and my good opinion increased. It has gradually grown, beginning with 1889, to be an absorbing question in my life, and it has been a pleasure for me since that period to subordinate my own interests to the one aspiration I had come to share with you to make Statehood certain to you, and to make it certain in such a way as would by the testimony of the American Congress vindicate you and your people from the obloquy of the past. I am also glad that the shepherd star of Utah, symbolizing as no other star has ever done an ambition to serve the common people, and the solidarity and destiny of all your people, has appeared in all its sovereignty and beauty upon the flag of our country during the time of your faithful and loving administration as President of your Church. I shall al- ways account it an honor and a pleasure, to be treasured by my children and held by them in sacred memory, to have been associated with yourself, with Presidents Smith, General Clawson, and the other good men of your membership, in this praiseworthy enter- prise of gaining justice to a noble tTerritory and a worthy people. I believe that in the  blessing coming to you with Statehood, a blessing to the spirit and the pride of your people, this long contest, ending successfully, will also be the means of bringing to your State countless jmaterial blessings. It has made your resources known to all the intelli- gent people of the republic, to nearly every community, and this information will bring to  ENDENTRY you speedily and in vast volume the capital necessary to develop your natural wealth, to create your factories, to build your cities, and to make you splendid in everything that commercial ambition and political aspiration may desire.  Hoping you may be spared many years to continue your gentle rule over the people you love so much, and invoking for you and all your people the highest prosperity and God's blessing always, I am,  Sincerely yours,   James S. Clarkson   President Wilford Woodruff, Salt Lake City, Utah. ENDENTRY P.S. It has occurred to me, as I have read this letter over that it would  not be just to let it go to you, and into the records of your people, without referring to the early, continuous, and remarkably influential and valuable services of the Hon. California. It may seem superfluous in me to do it, since you and all of your co-laborers know in far larger degree than I of the fact and measure of his important and devoted services. In the dignity of his strength, and with the profound respect for him in the nation, his early testimony to your honor and merit as a people and a Church, his ceaseless efforts to correct the wrong and false impressions of the Mormon character and purpose, and his loyalty in attesting your good-citizenship and your patriotism and love of the Republic in common with all American citizens, all served you to great results, and helped potentially in changing the opinions of many leaders of public thought and party action. I have heard him in many social and political gatherings in Chicago, speak of these subjects; and always he convinced the most of his hearers of the truth and justice of his opinion of the good faith and merit of the people of Utah. You will need some great lawyer, versed in constitutional law and profound in legal wisdom, to draft your Constitution. Judge Estee, I understand, was largely the author of the original and also the revised Constitution of California—an instrument which might well be taken as the model for your Constitution, as it was taken for North Dakota and other Western States. It would be a graceful act of remembering friendship to commit to Judge  Estee the work of framing a draft for the Constitution of Utah.  In writing this whole letter I have been keenly conscious of omitting reference to the many good works done, in line with the general effort in the nation, by men of your own fold and faith. I have fully appreciated the great value of their service, and yet I felt that I was not entitled to try and tell you of the great work done in the nation by your own people—from President Cannon, with his almost unrivalled abilities and fidelity, of which I have often heard Mr. Blaine ENDENTRY speak in words of cordial estimate and admiration, down through many others. But  I did not feel I had any commission or indeed excuse to tell you what you already knew of your own faithful men. As I have referred to it, I cannot refrain from speaking from my own knowledge of the especially admirable and capable work accomplished by Mr. Frank J. Cannon, one of the younger of your influential brethren, but who, like Aaron, is noted among his brothers for the eloquence and grace of the speech. Before Committees of Congressmen, before Committees of  Republicans, and before popular gatherings, including a Republican National Convention, he has held up your standards and proclaimed your noble ambition as a people, with a persuasive force and enkindling fervor that have wrought great things in placating prejudice and winning the good will of good people throughout the nation. I have seen so much of his good and faithful work, in places remote from you, and in acts unknown to you, that I cannot gain the consent of my own  heart to close this letter without at least speaking of the marked fidelity and value of his services.

My dear friend:  I am in receipt of your esteemed favor of the 27th, and am glad to hear from you and to receive the last number of the "Glacier". You do not mention your own health nor that of your family; but I presume that you are all well.  I am much obliged to you for reminding us concerning the $800.00 for Sam. I have had it enclosed to Cleo, and sent to your care. I hope it will reach all right. We feel greatly obliged to you for the trouble you have been at and sorry that you have been under the necessity of having to remind us of it.  Mrs. Woodruff regrets that she did not see you when you were here, and hopes that you did not feel offended at her not making her appearance. She was taking a bath at the time and hoped to see you again, when she would have ex- plained to you the reason why she did not receive you.  When you come over the next time I hope to be able to give you a ride in a vehicle and with a team that will please you. Mrs. Woodruff and myself think you will be gratified to know that your suggestions on this point have been carried out.  With kind regards to yourself and family, in which my friends with me join,  I remain, as ever, Your old friend,  W.

Dear Brethren:  I have received several short letters from you since you left Salt Lake City. The first was dated Jan. 11th at Man- nassa—you had set apart 5 mis- sionaries. The second at Sunset March 2nd—you had been to Moaencopy, had visited the villages of the Moquis; Br. Lot Smith wrote me an account of your visit among them, which I was very glad to get. Your third and last letter was written by Br. Grant March 5th, and gave an account of the death of Lot Smith's child.  I am interested in hearing  of your labors among the Lamanites and Saints and to know how you get along. We had a very inter- esting conference. Saturday and Sun- ENDENTRY to do justice to my correspon- dence but I will do the  best I can. I mention this so you may not think that I intentionally neglected to  answer your letters, for I am deeply interested in your letters and mission.  I received a letter a few days since from Br. Mc Donald and one from Jesse N. Smith—both were inter- esting.

Elder Brigham Young,  Dear Brother:  There is some business in Arizona that we would like you to attend to while you are down there. Inclosed you will find correspondence from Bp. Lot Smith. It will be well to have those charges carefully investigated and not be decided upon mere rumor. Whatever is proper under the circumstances should be done by the authorities there, under your counsel.  There may be other things there which may require your attention. If so, we hope you will find it convenient to have them cleared up.  We have received a letter from Bp. Ramah—a let- ter which you read. It contained a statement of the condition of their land and the offer that had been made to them for its sale to them. We understand that you wrote an answer, suggesting to them that they organize themselves into a company and endeavor to buy the land on the terms that were offered, and to give the land itself as security. This would be a very good plan, especially if they can get it at a moderate interest. Something should be done to secure this land to the saints, as Bp. McNeil represents it as a desirable place and one that others covet and would doubtless gladly purchase; but if it passes out of the hands of the people it will compel them to break up their homes and be a serious loss to them, which should be avoided if it possibly can be.

Elder Brigham Young,  Dear Brother:  At a meeting with Elder A. F. Macdonald on the 20th inst.—upon which occasion he submitted to us a power of attorney given to him by the Messrs. Garcia Brothers of the City of Mexico, conveying to him absolute author- ity to dispose of certain of their lands immediately adjacent to our settlements in Mexico—it was decided to refer this matter to a committee consisting of yourself (as chairman). Elders Moses Thatcher, Henry Eyring, with the request that you give Bro. Macdonald a hearing in re- gard to this matter, and satisfy yourselves as to the advisabil- ity of purchasing the lands for colonization purposes: and in order that this may be done it will be necessary that the prop- erty be inspected that its character and suitableness for col- onization may be ascertained without question or doubt.  We may say that Bro. Macdonald reported to us that he ac- cepted of this poerer of attorney on condition that we sanction his doing so; and it is understood, in case it shall be deemed advisable to enter into negotiations, that Bro.

Dear Brother:  Your favor from Queenstown and those of 10th. and 13th. insts. since you reached Liverpool have been duly received; we have also had the gratification of a visit from Sister Lizzie and your daughter, who appeare to be exceedingly happy in once more being at home with the Saints at head quarters. We had great satisfaction in sending you a cablegram announc- ing that all the indictments hanging over you in the third District Court had been dismissed by Judge Varien and we now take pleasure in informing you that we have decided on your re- lease to return home in time to be present at the dedication of the Temple in this city next April. We have not yet decided who shall be your suc- cessor in the Presidency of the European Mission, but at present incline to the idea of having some one of the Elders now laboring under your presi- dency appointed to take temporary charge between the time you leave Liver- pool and the arrival of your successor, who in all probability will start from here immediately after the conclusion of the services incident to the Annual Conference and the Temple dedication. We would like you to inform us if there are any brethren whom you deem suitable to assume this tempor- ary charge of the mission, and we will advise you of our action.

Dear Brother:  We are in receipt of two favors from you, one under date of the 1st and the other the 4th inst.  We are very glad to learn that you were so  fortunate as to escape the snares of our enemies which had been so well arranged for your capture. We sin- cerely hope that you will be prudent in your movements and keep out of the hands of your enemies.  We agree with you that Brother Martineaus case, if investigated at all, should be investigated thor- oughly, and in referring this business to you and the  ENDENTRY 2, B.

Macdonald sug- gested that these lands would be very suitable as a place of set- tlement of the Papago Indians who are now in Arizona, 1200 of whom, he said, are members of the church. He will be able to explain to the committee the situation of those Indians whom, be- ing landless, it would be conferring a great benefit of them to  acquire title to land in Mexico, on the terms proposed by the Garcia brothers.  We refer this whole business to your committee for in- vestigation: and should you decide that the removal of the Papa- go Indians is feasible, we should be pleased to have the committee frame some plan of removal, and submit to us.

We regret that they should be in such a condition, and such poor prospects for winter- ing their stock. The case of Bishop John Spencer as you describe it appeals strongly to our sympathy, and we think he is deserving of aid and should receive it. He is a man that has made no complaints and has not  applied for any aid. We feel that something ENDENTRY Presidents W Woodruff Geo. Q. Cannon Jos F Smith  Dec 30 1892 Recd Jan. 14, 1893 Ans.
