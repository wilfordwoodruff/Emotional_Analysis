 respondent, whether paid a salary or commission.  On the other hand, by the use of clippings it is pos-  sible for a paper to dispense entirely with corres-  pondence, and we have seen issues of trade journals  made up almost entirely with the scissors, that were  readable and profitable.    The service is economical because we read a  great many more papers than it would pay any one  journal to exchange with, and because it costs little  more to read for a hundred papers than for one.    Comments from Trade Papers.    "Your service has been very satisfactory as compared  with service of other Bureaus."— American Miller, Chicago.    "Your clipping service is a great improvement over any-  thing we have had here for a long time."— Ice and Refriger-  ation, Chicago.    "We wish to say that your service has proved more satis  factory than any other that we have ever tried."— Engineer-  ing Magazine, New York.    "I have dropped several Bureaus that gave us no items  except what we received through you, and we are using all  your items we possibly can." — Harness Gazette, Rome, N. Y.     "The Hotel World has tried nearly all the clipping Bureaus, and has never found one yet that could give the  service that is given by the Press Clipping Bureau." — Trade  Press, Chicago.    "That we have withstood repeated offers from your con-  temporaries, who have quoted lower prices, but which we  felt must mean inferior service, is proof positive that we  appreciate your Bureau."— Boot and Shoe Recorder, Boston.    "We have used clippings furnished us by several press  clipping agencies, and have no hesitation in saying that the  Press Clipping Bureau has given us by far the best service.  The readers have seemed to understand our wants, and  have been so diligent in supplying them that little of  interest to us has escaped their observation. The service  has been prompt, intelligent, and complete." — Manufacturing  Jeweler, Providence, R. I.    "We have used your service for ten years, during which  time we have had trial service for comparative purposes  from almost every other clipping Bureau, many of whom  had offered us much lower rates. The fact that we still  continue at the same price tells the story. From frequent  visits to your large establishment, we are thoroughly ac-  quainted with the admirable system by which your work is  done." — Guild & Lord, Textile World, Boston.    "We are among the most extensive regular purchasers of  newspaper clippings, and at all times for some years we  have been served by several of the largest clipping Bureaus.  During this period we have given most of the more prom-  inent Bureaus a trial. We started with Robert and Linn  Luce some six or seven years ago and at no time has their  service been discontinued. We find it prompt, thorough,  and reliable. We are buying more clippings from them  than from any other Bureau." — A. B. Gilbert, Associate Editor,  Engineering News, New York.

Welford Woodruff,    My Dear Sir: The receipt of your commmunication, of 8th inst.,  affords me much pleasure.    Reared as a Baptist, of "the most strictest sect," I became fa-  miliar with the anti-Mormon literature of the times, and, although I   had since grown older, and the earlier impressions had become modi-  fied, my visit to Salt Lake City, five years ago, discovered a state  of affairs that was a revelation to me. This, with the great kind-  ness of yourself, and of Mr. Cannon, impressed me very favorably, and  I have since, on many occasions, described and explained what I saw  and heard, largely assisted by the volumes which help to increase my  obligation to you.    I anticipate additiomnal pleasure and profit from the third vol-  ume of the history.    Gratefully yours,    B. W. Maples.

 PERSONAL AND POLITICAL WORK.    The idea of the clipping business was first  developed in personal lines, and in them its appli-  cation is so obvious as hardly to need explanation.  Public men, authors, artists, actors, musicians, —  all are interested in what the newspapers say of  them, or the things in which they are concerned.    To the political candidate the Bureau is a big  boon. The bulk of the clippings come from papers  that he does not ordinarily see, cannot easily get at,  has not time to read. From them he learns the  strength and the weakness of his opponent, sees  where he can fortify his own candidacy, learns what  pitfalls to avoid, finds who are really his friends.    Campaign committees find clippings useful in  much the same way. From them they keep posted  on the development of the campaign and the nature  of the local work.    For every public man it is important to know  the sentiments of his constituents on the questions  he may have opportunity to debate, in order that he  may keep in touch with them, and not needlessly  run counter to their wishes. Furthermore, clip-  pings furnish the material for many a speech and  many a magazine article.    So far as curiosity goes, the families of public  men are often more interested in what is said of  them than are the public men themselves. Many  persons holding elective or executive offices have  ordered clippings partly to gratify the interest of  wives, sons, daughters, or parents.    Another element of value in clippings not to  be lost sight of is what may be called their bio-  graphical or auto-biographical value. Statesmen  formerly had time to keep voluminous diaries;  today they can rarely attend to such matters. Clip-  pings will serve somewhat the same end.    Departments, Commissions, Bureaus, Etc.,  order clippings to secure data for statistical work,

 material for publication, information to aid opera-  tions, or comments to guage public opinion.    To the specialist in my line of public work the  Bureau offers a constant supply of information and  material.    To the man with a hobby, whether it be phil-  ately, numismatics, chess, whist, or any other of  the thousand and one things that serve as avoca-  tions or recreations, the Bureau is a labor-saving  device that helps gratify tastes and ambitions. In  the way of gathering "scraps," it does for any man  what no man could do by himself.    Obituary notices are frequently ordered by rela-  tives or friends. As we read only to order and it is  almost impossible to get back matter, requests  should be sent to us at the earliest possible moment.  In fact, whenever comment is wanted on current  happenings, the order must be filed early.    Comments by Individuals.    "I am pleased thus far with what you have sent me." — Gorham  D.

 DISCOURSE  BY  APOSTLE WILFORD WOODRUFF  DELIVERED  In the Tabernacle, Sunday, May  14th, 1882.    REPORTED BY GEO. F. GIBBS.    I feel disposed to read a chapter in  the Bible; the chapter that I shall   read contains, perhaps, a stronger   chain of truth concerning life and   death, the fall and redemption of   man, the redemption and resurrec-  tion of the dead, than any other I   know of in the Bible.    The speaker then read the ##1 Corinthians 15|15th   chapter, of 1st Corinthians##, and said:    Before proceeding to make any   remarks upon this chapter, I wish  to say that there is no person who  knows, before entering this building,  who is going to address the assem-  bly, and, therefore, we have no pre-  pared sermons to deliver, it may be  a miller, or it may be a mason, it  may be a carpenter, or it may be a   farmer, a lawyer, a merchant or   otherwise; this practice is peculiar to  the Church of Jesus Christ of Lat-  ter-day Saints, and the tendency is  to make the speaker, whoever he   may be, depend upon the spirit of  inspiration to guide his thoughts   and dictate his remarks. And, as a  general thing if God, through this  means, gives us nothing to say, we  can say nothing to instruct the peo-  ple.    I have often expressed my views  with regard to the position we oc-  cupy before heaven and earth, be-  fore God, angels and men, and the   views of Jesus and His Apostles and   Elders as they have come down to   us give a key to what I wish to say   upon this subject. If there is an   Emperor, a King, a President, a   ruler of any nation or people, whe-  ther a monarchy, kingdom or repub-  lic, that takes away from any of   his subjects or fellow-citizens the   right to worship God according to   the dictates of their own conscien-  ces, he deprives them of a right   which the God of heaven has guar-  anteed unto them. These are the   sentiments of the Latter-day Saints.   We believe in giving to all   men freedom, freedom in spirit and  action; we believe in religionists of   every creed and faith enjoying the  liberty to worship God according to   the dictates of their own consciences,   which right is guaranteed unto   them by God Himself; and the   man or set of men that would de-  prive their fellows of this God-given  right assumes a responsibility that  they must answer for before the  bar of God. If I had the power and   control of the whole world I would  never think of depriving any man,   woman or child of this natural; this   inherent right, whether their reli-  gious views were true or false. Can   you find from history that God at   any time forced any man to heaven  or Hell? No, you can not. And we  as  Latter-day Saints claim this right  and privilege for ourselves to wor-  ship God, to believe in God, and to  believe in the records of divine   truth—the Bible, the Book of Mor-  mon, the Doctrine and Covenants  and the revelations of God.    A public speaker, a teacher of the  people is held responsible before God   and his fellowmen for the doctrine   he teaches; if he teaches any other   gospel than that laid down in the   Bible and taught by the ancient   Prophets and Apostles he is under   condemnation, no matter who he   may be. Paul realized this fact so   keenly that he, in speaking about it  on one occasion, said: "Though we  or an angel from heaven, preach   any other gospel unto you than that   which we have preached unto you,  let him be accursed;" [##Galatians 1:8##] and he re-  peats this sentiment two or three  times over.    I wish to say a few words on one of  the verses I have read, the ##1 Corinthians 15:22|22nd##:  "For as in Adam all die, even so in  Christ shall all be made alive."   The world, more or less, has found a  great deal of fault with Mother Eve  and with Father Adam because of   the fall of man; what I have to say   with regard to it, I express as my  own opinnion. Adam and Eve   came to this world to perform ex-  actly the part that they acted in the  garden of Eden; and I will say, they  were ordained of God to do what   they did, and it was therefore ex-  pected that they would eat of the   forbidden fruit in order that man   might know both good and evil by  passing through this school of expe-  rience which this life affords us.   That is all I want to say about  Father Adam and Mother Eve.   Adam fell that man might be, and   men are that they might have joy [##2 Nephi 2:25##];  and some have found fault with  that. It has been said that God   commanded Adam to multiply and  replenish the earth; and it has been   said that Adam was not under the   necessity of falling in order to  multiply and replenish the earth,   but you will understand that the  woman was deceived and not the  man; and according to the justice of  God she would have been cast out   into the lowly and dreary world   alone and thus the first great com-  mand could not have been complied   with unless Adam had partaken of   the forbidden fruit. We acknow-  ledge that through Adam all have  died, that death through the fall   must pass upon the whole human   family, also upon the beasts of the  field, the fishes of the sea and the  fowls of the air and all the works of   God as far as this earth is concerned.   It is a law that is unchangeable and  irrevokable. It is true a few have  been translated, and there will be   living upon the earth thousands and   millions of people when the Messiah  comes in power and great glory to   reward every man accord-  ing to the deeds done in  the body, who will be changed  in the twinkling of an eye, from  mortality to immortality. Never-  theless they must pass through the  ordeal of death involved in the  change that will come upon them.   The Savior himself tasted of death;  He died to redeem the world; His  body was laid in the tomb, but it   did not see corruption; and after   three days it arose from the grave  and put on immortality. He was  the first fruit of the reuurrection.   There was no prophet, no saint or   sinner, from the days of Father  Adam to the days of Jesus that ever   rose from the dead through the keys  and power of the resurrection. Al-  though we read of some who were  restored to life, but this was not  what is termed the resurrection.    With regard to redemption, Paul   said: All the children of Adam are  redeemed from the fall by the aton-  ing blood of Jesus, and all infants  are redeemed as well as other peo-  ple. [##Romans 5:12-21##] There is no infant or child   that has died before arriving at the  years of accountability, but what is  redeemed, and is therefore entirely  beyond the torments of hell, to use   a sectarian term. And any doctrine,   such as the sprinkling of  infants or any religious rite for lit-  tle children is of no effect whatever   neither in this world nor in the  world to come. It is a man-made   doctrine, and therefore not ordained  of God; and I will defy any man to   find in any of the records of divine  truth any ordinance instituted for  the salvation of little innocent chil-  dren; it would be unnecessary on  the face of it, and the only thing   that can be found is where Jesus  took the little ones in his arms and  blessed them, which is and would  be perfectly right to do according to   the order of God. But the sprinkl-  ing of infants or the doctrine that  infants go to hell under any circum-  stances is a doctrine ordained of   man and not of God, and is there-  for of no avail and entirely wrong  and displeasing in the sight of God.  So much about the infants. I will   say again they are redeemed by the   blood of Jesus Christ, and when   they die, whether of Christian, Pa-  gan or Jewish parentage, their   spirits are taken home to God who  gave them, and never go to suffer  torments of any kind.    Another subject I wish to say a  few words upon: "In Christ all are  made alive." [##1 Corinthians 15:22##] Since the day that   sin entered into the world men have  been held accountable for their own  acts, and it has been known upon  this earth from the day, at least,  that Cain slew his brother Abel. [##Genesis 4:1-16##]  And sin has presented itself in dif-  ferent grades; there are murder, blas-  phemy, lying, stealing, whoredom,  and abominations of many different   forms, which have followed man   from generation to generation. For   there was a power that dwelt upon  the earth in the form of thousands   and millions of fallen spirits, one-  third of the hosts of heaven, which   had been cast out of heaven with   the devil in the great rebellion, who  remain in that condition and who   do not possess tabernacles, and   they make war upon the Saints of  God wherever or whenever they are   found upon the earth, and upon all  men; they seek to destroy the whole   human family, and have done so  from the beginning until the present   day, and they have not ceased their   labors nor do they intend to while   Satan remains unbound. All the   children of men who arrive at the   years of accountability are guilty of  sin, all being inclined to do evil as  the sparks are to fly upwards. "What  shall we do to be saved" was the cry   of the people who heard the preach-  ing of Peter on the day of Pentecost,   and the same may be said to be ap-  plicable to all men in every genera-  tion. [##Acts 2:37-38##] The answer would be, obey  the law of the Gospel. This is the   safe means given for the salvation of   the human family. The law of God,   the Gospel of Jesus Christ, which   Gospel contains the laws of God; it  contains the ordinances, it contains  the commandments, and any man  that breaks them is guilty before  God. And I will here say, as I wish   to be understood by all men, that   our faith is, there never has been  but one Gospel upon the earth  though to-day there are six hundred  three score and six different religi-  ous faiths, all more or less diverse   one from another; but there is but   the one true and everlasting Gospel,   and never will be any more, and it   is the same Gospel that was taught   to Adam, to Noah, to Abraham,   Isaac, Jacob and the Patriarchs, and   which Jesus and the Apostles preach-  ed; it never did vary in the least  in one single instance, nor never   will. And I say, if we teach any   other Gospel than that which was  taught by Jesus and His Apostles,   we teach a false Gospel, and shall  be under condemnation before God,   angels and men.    What is the Gospel as taught by  Jesus himself? The very first prin-  ciple was faith in the Messiah; this   was the first principle ever taught  to man. When Adam, after being   driven from the garden of Eden,   went to Adam-ondi-Ahman to offer  sacrifice, the angel of the Lord asked  him why he did so. Adam replied  that he did not know, but the Lord  had commanded him to do it. He  was then told that the blood of bulls   and goats, of rams and lambs   should be spilt upon the altar as a   type of the great and last sacrifice   which should be offered up for the   sins of the world. [##Moses 4:6-8##] The first princi-  ple, then, ever taught to Father  Adam was faith in the Messiah, who   was to come in the meridian of time   to lay down His life for the redemp-  tion of man. The second principle  was repentance. And what is re-  pentance? The forsaking of sin.   The man who repents, if he be a  swearer, swears no more; or a thief,   steals no more; he turns away from   all former sins and commits them  no more. It is not repentance to  say, I repent to-day, and then steal  to-morrow; that is the repentance of   the world, which is displeasing in   the sight of God. Repentance is the  second principle.    I have heard many men say, no   ordinances are necessary, that belief   only in the Lord Jesus Christ is ne-  cessary to be saved. I have not   learned that myself from any reve-  lation of God to man, either ancient  or modern. But on the contrary,  faith in Christ, repentance, and  baptism for the remission of sins were  taught by patriarchs and prophets  and by Jesus Christ and His Apos-  tles. Baptism for the remission of   sins is an ordinance of the Gospel.   Says one, baptism is not essential to   salvation. Jesus not only taught it   but rendered obedience himself to  that requirement, not that He was   baptized for the remission of sins,  but, as He said, "to fulfill all righte-  ousness," thus in this, as in all other   respects giving the example for all   who follow. [##Matthew 3:13-17##] When these principles  of the Gospel are complied with a   man is then a fit subject to receive   the Holy Ghost; and this holy gift   is bestowed to-day as it was ancient-  ly, by the laying on of hands by   men possessing the authority to ad-  minister in the ordinances of the   Gospel. These are the first princi-  ples of the Gospel which we Latter-  day Saints believe in and teach to   our fellow-men.  Joseph Smith received the minis-  tration of Angels, and he by revela-  tion organized the Church of Jesus   Christ of Latter-day Saints, and he  was taught by those who ministered   unto him what to teach to the peo-  ple, which was the everlasting Gos-  pel.    Again, men received the Holy Ghost   through the imposition of hands,   after being baptized for the remis-  sion of sins. The Holy Ghost was   imparted in that way, according to  the promise of those who preached   the Gospel. Joseph Smith when he  organized this Church in 1830 organ-  ized it by revelation; and while we  had hundreds of churches and sys-  tems and religions, not a single de-  nomination upon the earth at that   time preached the Gospel as taught   by the ancient prophets and Apost-  les, or had a church organized on   the earth with prophets and   Apostles, or with signs following the  believers as in ancient days. [##Doctrine and Covenants 21:1-3##] Can  you tell of one? I never heard of   one until I heard the Elders of this   Church preach the Gospel and set   forth the order of God. When God   commanded Joseph Smith to go   forth and organize the Church,  what authority had he to do so?   None at all until he was ordained  under the hands of those who had   held the keys of the priesthood upon   the earth. [##Doctrine and Covenants 27:8-13##] And I will say to this assem-  bly, in the days of Jesus Christ   He taught these principles to   the Jews; He brought the  Gospel to the Jews and established  His kingdom among them, and it   came with all its gifts, graces and   powers: the sick were healed; devils  were cast out; the gifts were mani-  fested among them. But the Jews   rejected Him, and they finally put  Him to death,—He and His Apos-  tles. He came to His own Father's  house but He was not received; and   then, according to command, this  Gospel went to the Gentiles—we are  all Gentiles in a national capacity,   we are not Jews, the Jews are  another class of men; they put the   Savior to death, and have suffered   for 1800 years in consequence,—they  have been trodden under the feet of  the Gentiles even until the present  day. Those that took part in that   deed and those who sanctioned it  said, Let His blood be upon us and   our children after us. The Gentile  Judge was willing to release Him  because he could find no fault in   Him; but the feeling and senti-  ment of the Jews was, "Crucify  him! Crucify him l [!]" [##Luke 23:21-33##] What in-  fidel is there, no matter who he is,   who does not believe in God, let  him read the revelations of heaven  and see the fulfillment of prophecy  from the beginning of Genesis to   our day, and he will see them ful-  filled to the very letter. There is  nothing that has been predicted by   Jesus or the Apostles but what has  already been fulfilled to the very   letter as far as time will admit, and   what has not will be. When, I say,   the Gospel was preached to the   Gentiles it went to them in all its   power, its beauty and glory, Priest-  hood and ordinances as it was of-  fered to the Jews. And Paul, in  writing to the Romans told them   not to be highminded, but to fear;   for if God spared not the natural   branches, who were the Jews, be-  cause of their unbelief, how could   he be more merciful to the unna-  tural branches, who were the Gen-  tiles? [##Romans 11:20-21##] Has there been the true  Church of Christ upon the earth   since the Apostles were slain? Can   you find a Church upon the earth  organized as it was in that day? No   not one. The Gentiles followed the  example of the Jews in their unbelief   and in putting to death those who  bore the holy priesthood; and in-  stead of the Church of Christ has   sprung up every kind of Church  during the last 1,800 years. But in  these the last days, God has again   restored the everlasting Gospel; and  any man who believes the Bible   must believe the fulfillment of reve-  lation, and he cannot believe in the   fulfillment of prophecy without be-  lieving that God would send again  to the earth angels to deliver that   Gospel. And why send an angel   for this purpose? Because the Gos-  pel was taken from the earth in  consequence of the unbelief of the   Gentiles and the powerful opposi-  tion that was brought against the   comparative few who represented it.   And in fulfillment of the revelation  of St. John, John the Baptist came   to Joseph Smith and conferred upon   him, after a period of preparation   on his part, the Aaronic Priesthood   which authorized him to preach and   to baptize for the remission of sins,  and to administer the sacrament, but   not to lay on hands for the recep-  tion of the Holy Ghost. In due   time, however, Peter, James and   John appeared to him also and con-  ferred upon him the Melchesi-  dek order of Priesthood and  Apostleship, which gave him the  power to organize the kingdom of   God upon the earth. [##Doctrine and Covenants 27:8-13##] These are  truths whether the world believe  them or not. It makes no difference;  it is the work of Almighty God, and  he is the originator of it. How is  it with the Elders of Israel? God  has called men from the plow, the  hammer and anvil, from the car-  penter's bench, etc., unlearned and   weak mortals, and they have been   sent out to the world to bear record  of this new and everlasting gospel   restored in our day. And what have  they said to the methodists, the  Baptists, and all other religionists   and classes of men. God Almighty  has given unto me a dispensation of  the Gospel and I offer it to you; he   that believes on the Lord Jesus  Christ, and that I am his servant  having His Gospel message to de-  clare to all those to whom I am sen[t,]  and repents and is baptized for th[e]  remission of his sins, shall receiv[e]  the Holy Ghost. This has bee[n]  the purport of the message [we]  have borne to men and nations [for]   the last fifty years. And now [if]   God has nothing to do with thi[s,]   how is it that we have been able [to]  gather together thousands and te[ns]   of thousands from about all natio[ns]   under heaven by the simple p[ro-]  clamation of the Gospel-mess[age?]  How long would it be before Jo[seph]   Smith or any other man who w[ould]  go forth bearing the message [like]  we do, and making the promises [that]  we make, would be found out t[o be]  an imposter unless the promises [we]  made were genuine and looked [upon]  in such a way as to give entire [satis-]  faction to those who hearken[ed]   his word? The whole secret o[f our]  success as far as making conve[rts]   concerned is, that we preach [the]  same Gospel in all its simplicity [and]   plainness that Jesus preached,   that the Holy Ghost rests [upon]   those who receive it, filling [their]  hearts with joy and gladnes[s un-]  speakable, and making them [as one;]   and they then know of the do[ctrine]   for themselves whether it be [of God]  or man. And this Gospel of [Christ]  which we offer is what has le[d this]   Church from its first [organ-]  ization until to-day. And, as I [have]  often said, had it not been fo[r the]  Gospel revealed to us, we [might]   have labored until we were as [old as]  Methusaleh, and Utah [to-day]   would have been as barren as [it was]  in 1847 when we first came to [these]   valleys. At that time we fo[und a]   barren desert, yes, as barren [as the]   desert of Sahara, with no ma[rk of]   the Anglo Saxon race. But [travel]   through Utah to-day and we [find]   houses and cities, gardens [and]   orchards, meeting-houses and [taber-]  nacles and school-houses and [dwell-]  ings, with the blessing of G[od at-]  tending the labors of the p[eople;]   and a community of people [from]  almost every nation taken from [the]   various sects and parties, and [they]  are here through the inspira[tion of]  Almighty-God, and I know it. [We have]   not had power of ourselv[es to]   influence any man or woman [with]   regard to these things. They [have]  been influenced by the testimo[ny of]  Jesus Christ and by the Gosp[el of]  the Son of God. These are [prin-]  ciples by which all men are s[aved.]   All men are saved by and thr[ough]   the blood of Jesus Christ, th[rough]  obedience to the Gospel.    I realize our condition and [the po-]  sition occupied by this generat[ion. I]  know we are looked upon as [a bad]  people, and we are considered [a very]  ignorant people. There never [were]   more epithets heaped upon [Jesus]  Christ and the Apostles than [upon]   the Latter-day Saints. W[hy is]  this? Are we so much wors[e than]  the world? No, we are not. [What]  then is the matter? The Lo[rd Al-]  mighty has set His hand to [gather]  His people, and to build up H[is Zion]   and to establish his Church in [these]  the last days; and the world [do not]  like the doctrine we teach, as [it lays]   the axe at the root of the tre[e, and]   consequently we have been [perse-]  cuted from the time tha[t this]   Church was organized until t[o-day;]   and the persecution will co[ntinue]   more or less until He reigns [whose]  right it is to reign, until the [Lord]   Jesus Christ comes in the clo[uds of]  heaven to reward every m[an ac-]  cording to the deeds done [in the]  body.    Now I want to say to the L[atter-]  day Saints, we are called to a [great]  work, and we have been ca[lled of]  God, and we, as Elders, hav[e gone]  forth whithersoever we were [sent,]   taking our lives in our hands, [trav-]  eling hundreds and thousan[ds of]  miles without purse or sc[rip. I]  have waded swamps and swu[m riv-]  ers, and have asked my brea[d from]  door to door; and have d[evoted]  nearly 50 years to this work[. And]  why? Was there gold eno[ugh in]   California to have hired me to [do it?]   No, verily; and what I have don[e and]  what my brethren have don[e, we]   have done because we were [com-]  manded of God. And this [is the]   position we occupy to-day. W[e have]  preached and labored at hom[e and]   abroad, and we intend to co[ntinue]   our labors, by the help of G[od, as]  long as we can have liberty to [do it,]  and until the Gentiles prove [them-]  selves unworthy of eternal life, [and]   until the judgments of God ov[ertake]   the world, which are at the [door.]   Does this generation know [what]   awaits them? Does our own n[ation?]  No, the world is ignorant of [what]   must, sooner or later, befall the[m.]    Here is the Christian world [pro-]  fessing to believe the Bible, ca[n you]  show me wherein any of the p[redic-]  tions of the prophets, whether [those]

 Briant S. Young    Lehi, Utah, Jan. 23, 18967.    HON. WILFORD WOODRUFF,  Prest. Church of J. C. of L. D. S.,  Salt Lake City, Utah.    Respected Sir; It is with the deepest interest that I read in  this mornings ^p^aper, of an interview published therein regarding your-  self and the members of the Semi-centennial Celebration which is to  take place this year, and noting that Judge Colborn was the main  apeaker for the committie, and noting that you were in favor of giving  said committe $10,000 to aid them in the celebration, I address you  relative to the matter, and call your attenti^o^n to a few facts of which  you may not be aware.    In the first place, does it not appear that we have many of Utah's  sons, members of the church who are as capable, and even more so, of,  attending this afafair, without the guidance of such a man Colburn.  While true he was appointed by the governor, I yet must candidly con-  fess that it reflects no great credit on the govrernor, for this man Col[-]  burn came to Utah during the I"boom" and it was such men as him, that  constituted the "Liberal" party that were so harsch in their condem-  nation of the church, and its follwers. It was such men was him, that  have never done anything for Utah or your city, but that it helped  them first. Can it be said that Utah must needs accept the services  of outsiders, to portray the efforts of Utah's pioneers, when in fact  they know nothing of it, beyond what they may read, or hear, and then-  in what do^i^storted, irrelevant manner?    Last season, when that Mid-summer Carnival was given, I was at a  meeting at which this man arose, and delivered an address, during which  he used words to the effect that he "was tired of seeing home faces, and  we wanted outsiders to come in and get the benefits" or words to that  effect.    Then there is another man on that committee, whom I know well, that  is E. G. Rognon. He is a good, smart young man, but he issnn't a ntive^native^  of Utah, neither does he represent her, beyond what affects his ^own^ interests    Now then, I ask you candidly, do you think these the kind of men  to handle money to represent Utahs great celebartion, and to handle the  money of the people whom they slightlingly designate as "Mormons?"    I am addressing this letter to you, generally, but while I speak for  others, I confess I speak as much for myself.    I am a Utah boy; born of its greated^st^ people; a grand-son of  Brigham Young, and the son of Jos. A Young, men who have liaaid ^down^ their lives  and liberties on behalf of our church and its noble work. I fought in  the great Peoples-Liberal party campaign, six years ago, and though I  was a humble worker, my work was at least sincere. I carried a drum,  and I hammered at it too, and had all the others made as much noise as  I tried to do, the echo of our great vistory (instead of defeat) would go  down in counlttless ages. Two years ago, nearly three, I—with some  other ^y^oung men, received permission to use the Bee-hive house for a  demonstaration for the old pioneers. It was given, and 800 of them  were entertianed, and lived again in the days of long ago. Bills on  that occasion, were a matter of necessity contracted, and one of  them, I have been sued for, and the judgement entered against me, be-  cause I have been unable to pay it. Now, do you call this just? What  benefit did I—or any of us get from it? Nothing but that—which is more  money than money can ever buy—tears of gratitude from old eyes, and  from old lips, and old forms, within the shadow of the grave, blessed  and thanked us for what we done. And that night too, did I not act as  mediator? R. N. Baskin, at that time mayor, on my personal solicitation  attended, and for the first time in his life, commingled with the  "hated Mormons" and grasped them hand to had^nd^    Now then, again I ask, why are such men as this allowed these  things?    Can Utah not furnish brains and muscle enough, to dispense with the  services of these outsiders^?^ Ten, twelve, fifteen years ago, when our

Therefore I, a humble member of this great body of people, ask  that before giving this money into their hands, you will see that the  right kind of people are there to handle it.  See that lall its offi-  cers are Utionians -- that no man will receive a benefit, unless it be the  reflection of a "work well done."    If Judge Colborn works ion this celebration, I hesitate not to  prophecy that he will receive as much, if not more benefit from it,  than all the Utonians combined, or at least, will receive his   share.  All statements I make, I can, and will at any time verify.    I therefore ask that you put (or see it is done) on that committtee,  more suhch men as Spencer Clawson; C. R. Savage, H. G. Whitney, Mrs. Snell  and of the same kind.  It is not--or should not be the carpet-baggers  to control money that the people they hate so, shuld furnish.    In closing I beg to ask that you will give this communication  your careful consideration, and not throw aside as worthless.    With deepest respect, and with the iw^wi^sh that God may guide you  aright in the matter, I am,    Your brother in the gospel,  Briant S Young.    I beg to state if there is anything  further wanted in the way  of information, I will gladly  give it.

 Eureka, Tintic. May. 19th 1897.    Pres. Woodruf  Salt Lake City    Dear Bro.    Is there any  emigration fund now in the   church. Why I ask is that I have  agreed to furnish one hundred dollars  to help two of our saints from  Norway to this country She is  coming much earlier than was  at first expected, and I find  that it will be difficult to meet  it. I will pay a reasonable int.  if you can furnish a part of that  amount. All the security that I  can give will be, a note signed  by a good L. D. Saint Mr O. H. Olsen  of Santaquinn, who is president of   the Seventies Corum. answer at  your earliest convenience.    Yours very Respectfully  C. A. Mace    I have not mentioned this to Mr  Olsen, but can get him. See over 
 a friend in deed, and being a  grand son of Brigham Young  and reeliazing that you have  grand sons of your own, I   believe you will help me.  Mother can not help me, as  she is married to a Dr.  Willard, and their wealth is  in property. My wife commited  adultry a short time ago, and  we seperated but she man-  aged to leave me in debt  to the amount of $200.00/100,   which I cut down to $75.00/100  before I was thrown out  of employement, and I lost  all I had saved previous  to my wifes sin, in a fire.  I cannot get work here, at  anything that will bring  me more than my board,   and I cannot leave here,  untill I have paid up

In reply I must say  that I esteem it an honor to be  chosen to carry the Gospel to the  nations of the earth, and by the  help of the Lord will be ready to leave

Yours of the 1st inst  to hand stating my name had  been suggested & accepted as  a missionary to the Southern  States, and asking that I  have my bishop endorse my  answer, I am of the opinion  that there must be some  mistake in this as I was  chosen as bishop of this ward  last November, and still hold  that position. I forwarded the  names of Wm Staples and Leslie  George to the president of our  Stake as missionaries last  spring and these brethren have  never heard from you as yet,  they are good examplary

 those of Jonah to the city of Nineveh, or  those of Isaiah to Israel, or to Tyre  and Sidon and other ancient cities  and peoples, have fallen unfulfilled?   No, there is no man can point to a   single prophecy of the servants of   God that has failed in its fulfilment.  Does not the Christian world know   that the Bible is full of revelation  pointing to this day and age of the   world? Let them read the revela-  tions of St. John given him while  upon the Isle of Patmos and they   will know what judgments await this   generation before the coming of the   Son of Man. [##Revelation 14##] There is a work for   somebody to perform. But when  we undertake to declare in all seri-  ousness that God has anything to do  with the work in which we are en-  gaged they will laugh you in the  face, and the reason is, they have  departed from God and are entirely  unable to comprehend His ways or  His purposes; and instead of believ-  ing the plain and literal meaning of   the word of God they spiritualize it to  suit themselves. Daniel was prepar-  ed to enter the den of lions [##Daniel 6##]; the three   Hebrew children were not afraid of   the fate that awaited them [##Daniel 3##]; the   Apostles were valiant for the truth   and shrank not from death for its   sake, and why could those men and  others under similar circumstances  stand by their convictions without  flinching? Because, in the first  place, they had the truth and they  knew it for themselves; and in the   second place, the Holy Ghost, the  Comforter, sustained them as that   power alone can in all the trying  scenes through which the people of  God are called to pass. And this is   so to-day. What the Latter-day   Saints have done by way of preach-  ing the Gospel under all kinds of   difficulties, building up cities and  subduing waste lands, and establish-  ing themselves in the earth, they  have done by the revelations and   commandments of God to them.    I will say a few words concerning  a certain principle, and why I say it   is because we cannot help looking at  the signs of the times as they ap-  pear to-day. I was reading in the   NEWS last evening a speech reported   to have been made by Joseph Smith,  son of the Prophet Joseph Smith,  in which he accuses us of pursuing  an entirely different course from   that of his father; that his father  had nothing to do with the endow-  ments which form a part of our re-  ligious faith; and that his father had   nothing to do with the patriarchal  order of marriage; and he accuses   our bishops of polluting the women  of their several wards so that they   are not fit for wives. This last ac-  cusation is so palpably false and so  utterly mendacious as to be entirely  unworthy of our notice, and I be-  lieve I ought to apologise to this con-  gregation for referring to it at all.  But it shows how weak must be the   hope and faith of men who pretend   to be teachers among the people   when they descend to traduce the  character of innocent men by wil-  fully lying in the hope of bolstering  up and establishing their own pecu-  liar cause. And with regard to the   others, I wish to say, that Joseph   Smith utters falsehoods when he  says what he is reported to have   said about his father; for I bear re-  cord to this congregation, and I ask   our young people to bear it in mind   after I am gone, that Joseph Smith   first made known to me the very or-  dinances which we give to the Lat-  ter-day Saints in our endowments;  I received my endowments un-  der the direction of Joseph Smith.  Emma Smith, the widow of the   Prophet, is said to have maintained  to her dying moments that her hus-  band had nothing to do with the pa-  triarchal order of marriage, but that   it was Brigham Young that got  that up. I bear record be-  fore God, angels and men that Jo-  seph Smith received that revelation;   and I bear record that Emma Smith  gave her husband in marriage  several women while he was living,  some of whom are to-day living in  this city, and some may be present  in this congregation, and who, if   called upon, would confirm my  words. But lo and behold, we hear  of publication after publication now   a days declaring that Joseph Smith   had nothing to do with these things.  Joseph Smith himself organized  every endowment in our Church   and revealed the same to the Church   and he lived to receive every key of   the Aaronic and Melchisedec priest-  hoods from the hands of the men   who held them while in the flesh,  and who hold them in eternity. [##Doctrine and Covenants 27:8-12##]    I feel to say to the Latter-day   Saints everywhere, brethern and   sisters, do good and you will reap   good; what you sow you will also   reap. [##Galatians 6:7##] What our nation sows that it   will also reap, and what it measures   to others will be meted back to it   heaped up, pressed down and run-  ning over. I have peculiar feelings  in reflecting upon the condition of  our own nation. Here are the   Methodists and Presbyterians and  others all combining to use   their influence religiously and politi-  cally to put down "Mormonism"   which they say is an abomination  in the land, and a great stain upon   our nation's escutcheon. "O, my  God," I feel to say, "I would our  nation could see and understand   things as they really are." I want  to ask a question. When the sixth   angel sounds his trump revealing  the secret acts of men to an assem-  bled world, which will include us,   what will be the feelings of the   present generation and the rulers  and leading men and women of our  nation as well as those of other   nations, and the leaders of the   Christian world when that angel   declares unto all those who have   condemned and cried against the   Latter-day Saints, especially those  who have taken a leading part, say-  ing, "You, yourselves are defiled   with women, and your own acts,  which are recorded on high will rise   in judgment against you. I say to  this nation, and especially to those   who are actively engaged in bring-  ing about a crusade against us un-  der the cloak of religion, "Sin lies  at your own doors, and what you   measure unto us will, according to   the eternal law of retribution, be  meted back to you, and you cannot   escape it." [##Revelation 9:13-19##] We declare to all men   that the God of heaven commanded   Joseph Smith to introduce and prac-  tice the patriarchal order of marriage  including the plurality of wives.  And why? Because it was the law   given to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob  for certain purposes; that holy men  might have their wives and chil-  dren with them in the morning of   the first resurrection in their family  organization to inherit kingdoms,  thrones, principalities and powers in   the presence of God throughout the  endless ages of eternity. Ladies  and gentlemen, the Latter-day Saints   are not the people you think they  are; they are not guilty of the  crimes and wickedness they are ac-  cused of, but on the contrary, they  are as a people, free from the sins   and abominations of this generation.   We are represented as being a com-  munity of adulterers, and as being   murderers. We are no more guilty   of such crimes than were Abra-  ham Isaac and Jacob. What God   has revealed unto us, and that   which we know ourselves to be right  and true, we cherish and revere; and  the covenants that we have en-  tered into in consequence of the re-  velations of God to us, we hold sa-  cred. Our wives and children we   love and respect, and we could no   more deny them their claims upon   us as husbands and fathers, than we  could deny our God.    Another thing, there is no  man that has ever lived who can claim  a wife or child in the resurrection   unless he and she were married and  sealed by divine authority by a man  delegated of heaven to perform the  ordinance of marriage. All con-  tracts not ordained of God entered  into by men, end with this life, and   are therefore without binding effect  in the world to come. And herein  is the difference of the position of  the Latter-day Saints and of the  Christian world with respect to the  married state. The nature of our  marriage covenant is sacred and  binding both for time and eternity,  and I would just as soon think of   denying my God as to sever the re-  lationship existing between me and   my wives and children. Our plural  wives and our children are just as  dear to us as the one wife and the  children of the Gentiles are to them;  and what is more, we have married   our wives by command of God, and  by authority of His Holy Priest-  hood, which has been restored again  to earth; and if we prove faithful   and true to Him and to one another,   we shall claim our wives and chil-  dren in the world to come. Amen.

 CATHOLIC TRUTH SOCIETY    PRESIDIO    San Francisco, Cal. July 10, 1898    Wilford Woodruff.  Salt Lake City.    Dear Brother,    Yours of June 27 at hand, just received. Informing me  that my berth has been secured for a passage to  Europe. And as it is impossible for me to report at the  appointed time, I wish to give you a few of my  reasons for not dong being prepared, and aI also wish  to beg your pardon for disapointing you.    When I failed to make colections, that were due me  and found that it was impossibe for me to raise the  required amount of money to fill the mission that  was expected of me. I inlisted, and am on my way  to the Philipenes, and expect to go with the next expedition  after the one that is leaving now. I will not be prepared  to go to Europe for at least two years.    Yours Respectfully,  C. S. Hill.  Utah Battery, Presidio  San Francisco Cal.

I answered  the letter the same day, but  as my Bishop lives eighty  five miles from Provo, I had  to send it home, first, to be  indorsed. Somehow, my letter  was delaid for three or four  days; consequently my answer  to the call was not sent when   I reached home.

Dear Brethren:    I received a notice from you some  years ago asking me to prepare and get ready  to leave (on a mission to Scandinavia) the 20th  of Feb. 1892 not having the mean[s] and not know-  ing where to obtain it, I asked for an extention of  time which were granted me (untill fall of 1893)  thinking that I would be able to secure enough   means in that time. I went of[f] to work but  had only worked 2 week when I was taken very  sick and had to be sent home in that   condition, it took the best part of the summer  before I got well. It seem[s] as though that everything  that I have put my hands to do, I have made  a complete failure of it, or itn other words there  has been no blessing in anything that I have  done, and I find myself poorer than ever.

 Snowflake Navajo Co Arizona  March 5th1897.    Pesident Wilford Woodruff.  Salt Lake City Utah.    Dear Sir.  Parden the liberty I take in writing to you. But I  have thought the matter over seriously and have  come to the conclusion that this is the best plan.  We have lived in Arizona since January 16th 1879  We have lived on a dry hill all that time.  In the first place four or five men of fathers  company drawed for some lots, and it happen-  ed that we got this one. It would have been  a very desirable place if the water had been  brought up on the plateau. But they made  the ditch around the edge of the hill and   left us out high and dry    We have worked hard very hard indeed in this  country to make a home, but we have only a log  room and a smaller room added on, that is all  we have had untill last Summer we had the  walls of a brick house with theree rooms laid 
 Department of Justice.    OFFICE OF  UNITED STATES ATTORNEY,  DISTRICT OF UTAH,    J. W. JUDD,  U.S. ATTORNEY.    Salt Lake City, August 23, 1897., 189    Wilford Woodruff, President,  Church of Jesus Christ of L.D.S.  Salt Lake City. Utah.    Most Reverend Sir:    I am in receipt of a letter from Geo. E. Hill, one of your  Missionaries, directed to me from Waterford, Miss., which I herewith  take pleasure in enclosing to you. Permit me a word of explanation:    In more than one instance it has been my pleasure to give a  letter of recommendation to your Missionaries when going into my  Southern country, especially my State of Tennessee, as well as from time  to time having by word of mouth commended them to my people there and  solicited kind and christian treatment in their behalf. When Mr.  Hill left here last April I gave him a letter—of which he speaks in  the enclosure. Of course, with the detailed statement of Mr. Hill's  work I have no special concern, except that gratification which comes  to any citizen upon learning that another is being well treated and  is performing a christian work which, let us hope, is always calculated  to better whoever may accept and act upon such teachings. I great-  ly appreciate Mr. Hill's painstaking letter to me, for it gives me an  insight into the work that I myself before did not understand.    You will note that he asks me for a further letter stating  what I know of the people of Utah and of the country in general. I  have by this mail written to him in answer stating substantially  that I have been all over the State of Utah, from one end of it to the 
 many things. I have not tried to shirk from  any duty that I have been called to perform, for  I have been laboring in all callings ^were in I have been called to labor^ in the church  since I was called to Scandinavia. It is  true that I have many faults and failings, but   I am striving to overcome them by the help of  God, for I know that of myself I am nothing.    I have during the last years been laboring as  follows—one winter I labored as a home missionary  traveling from house to house, preaching the  Gospell. I have taken a 5 months M.I.A  course, labored as Principle of Religion Classes  in 7th Ward, for 2 years. I have been counselor  [START HERE] in M.I.A. for a number of years, and a teacher  in the Sabbath School, and in all of these  labors, the Lord has greatly blessed me.    Dear Brethren, I hope you will pardon  me for describing these thing to you, for I   do not tell you of these things to receive  any praise whatever, but that you may  better understand things as they are, for I  thank the Lord for choosing me to labor in  these callings.    My object of writting you is this, I am 
 Moroni City Oct. 16th [18]97.    Presadent Wilford Woodruff,  And Brothern of the Committee.    Salt Lake City, Utah.    Dear Brotheren:    As you have requested me   to express my feelings with   regards to the mission I have   been called to perform.    I will do so with a feeling of   satisfaction and with pleasure.  Believeing as I do, (that God   has/spoken from the heavens  in these latter days, and   has established his church here   upon the earth, for the last  time Pwith its officers, and   unto them, revealing his mind   and will continually, and

 other and have mixed and mingled with the people and partaken of  their hospitality, and that I can say from my own personal knowledge  that a more kind-hearted, hospitable and well-intentioned people do  not exist, in my opinion, in any nook or corner of the United States,  that a man can go to or from any point in Utah and exercise the  rights of a citizen of this State, or any State, with as much safety  as he can in any other given point in our country; that there are no  men here who have a great number of wives, such as stated in Mr.  Hill's letter, and that polygamy as a system has been abandoned by  the Mormon church; that if any one desires to come to Utah to live  and to be an industrious, good citizen, he can get along as well here  as anywhere, so far as exercising the rights of a citizen is con-  cerned.    Upon my recent visit in the South I took some pains to in-  quire into the cause of the friction that at times occurs between  your missionaries and the people, and am able to state to you one,  at least, of the causes which is more fruitful of such troubles. I  do this with no disposition to in any way interfere with your direc-  tions or the work of your church, but as a piece of information which  I feel might be of value to you. The trouble of which I speak comes  in this way: The people of Utah have their system of bishops, coun-  selors and teachers, and what are called—as I understand it—home  or house to house missionaries. They not only see no harm in those  practices here at home, but it is a thing, I take it, that is much  practiced as well as much appreciated in your system of religious  teaching. Now when these young men get out of Utah they take largely  these ideas with them and when they get down in my Southern country  where the people are just as hospitable as they are anywhere on the glo 
 up and have succeeded in getting the roof on  this Winter, but it isn't suitable to live in yet.    Now we have lived here eighteen years and  have had nine children born here. We had  two children born in Utah before we came  here. We buried our first boy at Sunset on our  way out here. And our little daughter that we  had when we came, lived to be sixteen years old,  and was drowned the 7th of June 1893, her name  was Eliza Roxie.    Emma Matilda was our nect girl, she is now  seventeen years old, and she has taken a fancy  to a young fellow who is not at all worthy  of her, and she is so determined we do not  know what to do with her.    Now could you advise us to move to an ot-  er place or have you a place a farm or  some establishment that you would like  an industrious family to come to for we  are all good willing workers.    The main reason why I would like  a change is to get the mind of my

 that they are inspired and   directed by his spirit.)    "I say believing this," it would  be unwisely of me to decline  being a candadate for that   Field of Labor which my name   has been suggested and excepted  to labor in. I am determend and   ambitious to fulfill this mission   honorable, and in prase to our  Heavenly Father; Notwithstanding   it being quite a dificulty field   to labor in, the people being more  hostile than perhaps, in some  of the other fields of labor. Yet,   through the grace of God I will  perform this mission. This is my   faith with regard to it.    Brothern, I think it realy an   honor and a favor shown unto me.  It has long been my desire  to be a usefull instrument in 
 globe—to which you will see Mr. Hill testifies—they carry this  habit of house to house canvas with them and they frequently visit  peoples houses in the absence of the head of the family and preach  their doctrine to the women and children. This, you can see is apt  to raise resentment upon the part of the head of the family; then  trouble begins. I do not believe that all of them do this, in fact  I know they do not, but some are sufficiently indiscreet to undertake  the conversion and baptism of the women and children in the absence of  the head of the family, and you can well see what results a thing  of this kind would produce.    It is my opinion that your people will be as well received  in the East as the advocates of any church in the land provided they  will adopt the methods that ministers of other churches adopt; at  least I know such is the case in my State of Tennessee. On my recent  visit I took occasion to talk to the people about the Mormons and be-  spoke for them kind and hospitable treatment, and in no instance  did I hear of any bad feelings against the Mormons, except where it  arose out of some such trouble as I have mentioned in this letter.    Allow me to repeat, that it is not with a disposition on my  part to interfere with your methods that these suggestions are made,  but purely out of the great respect that I have for you, of which,  on more than one occasion, you have heretofore had sufficient testimony    I am, with great respect,  Your obedient servant,    J. W. Judd 
 desirous to received some instructions or counsel  from you. I see no chance for me to go to Scan-  dinavia at present, for I have no means at all.    But, if I could be changed to the Southern  States or any other place, where I can travel  without purse or scrip, then I am at your  command. Now if this would make no diffe-  rence to you, and it be as acceptable to the Lord  then I would like this change. And I think  through the blessings of the Lord that I  shall be able to go and at least do some  good. Ill never fell satisfied until that  I will be able to fulfill a mission, for I love  the Gospel and know the truth's there'of. I  have no faults to find with anyone but  my-own-self, perhaps I could do better  than I have done, but I have been young and  inexperient in many things. I have in a  weak way tryed to serve the Lord. I have  fasted and prayed and gone into desolate  places and prayed and asked counsel of my Creator  (over)

Now I would be willing to do most anything in  reason to save her from having this fellow.    Smith D Rogers is my husbands name. Son of  Samuel H, and Anna Matilda Rogers. They  are both dead. Bro Samuel H Rogers had his fa-  ther and mother adopted into your family. There  fore you are a relative of ours and we would ask  you to assist us some way, so that we shall not  have a black sheep in our flock. She has  always been obedient only in regard to this fel-  low she has been very disobedient. She is quite  young and easily led, and if we could get her  away she might get her mind off of him.    Now my husband would never leave here un-  less called by the Priesthood and that is why  we stay on this bare hill. He says. "They told   me the water would come on the hill lots as  soon as it would come on the lot below. So I  will stay here untill they call me sumeplacelse"

 Salem, June, 20, 1897.    Pres. Wilford Woodruff.    Dear Brother    Pardon me if I take the  wrong steps in this case.

He  has related to me a pitiful story  and asks me to write to you  to get his answer.

 and to open up the way before ^me^ that I  could go and perform the duties required  of me. But it seem as though the heavens  have been brass over my head on that one  thing viz. means to go on missions. In all other  things I beleive the Lord has heard and answered  my prayers.    I hope I have not tired you with   my long writting, but if so kindly excuse me.    Hoping you will read this over and  answer me as soon as convenient.    I have nothing but best wishes for  the Church of God and for all good men  and women on the face of the earth.    Any instructions you wish to give  me shall be greatfully accepted.    Your brother in the Gospel,   Elias Nielsen.  Logan, 7th Ward.  Utah.    I think it would be well to change his appointment  from Skandinavia to the S. S. mission, and let him  report, with his Bp's endorsement, when he can  go—or if needed most in the N. states, let him go there. J. F. S. 
 Now we have lived here eighteen years and no  prospect to better our condition. What shall  we do? If you could give us something to do  somewhere else I would be glad    I am Jesse N Smith's daughter and my parents  are here. But I would be willing to go any-  where to save my daughter.    Smith, and his two bothers, have worked  together ever since their parents died. But there  has not been the best of feeling all the time,  and we have many a time wished we lived otherwise  I do not ^believe^ the Lord wishes his children to  alway be unhappy.    Please consider ourcase. And if you think  that we have made enough sacrifices with-  out loosing our daughter for time and  perhaps all eternity; Please do something  to lift our burden of sorrow. If you can  do nothing else, please pray for us.    Eliza Snow Smith Rogers    [upside-down text] Eliza Snow Smith Rogers  Mar. 5 [18]97. [end of upside-down text]
