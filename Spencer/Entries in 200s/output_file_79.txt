I should suggest an "Annual License" for all of these Principals, pending thesie examination for the "Academic Degree" in "Pedagogy", next year.  14. In compliance with the instructions of Gen Circ. No. 5. I reminded Bro. Moench in a letter of May 14, of the necessity of completing his examination in Drawing, Music, and Logic in the Intermediate Grade which he had not done last year, thus not getting a Percentage in "General Efficiency." I also suggested to him the advisability of preparing himself for the "Academic Degree," as it became necessary for such an important place as Ogden to have its Church Academy presided over by a regular "Professor" by and by. This I wrote in an official letter, of which the copy is on file. In consid- eration, however, of the long and faithful services of Bro. Moench, I wrote him also a private letter of encouragement and explanation. All this Bro. Moench has answered by enclosed letter. I am in favor of Bro. Moench being granted his full papers for the Intermediate Grade without any further examination by order of the General Board, in consideration of his long and faithful services. But the "Academic Degree" he should obtain in the prescribed course of pro- ceedings. Please return his letter to me with your instructions.  15. From several directions have propositions been made by Church School Teachers to organize into a regular body for mutual support, to which end they ask for the privilege of electing a Committee ENDENTRY Provo City, November 6, 1890  President Wilford Woodruff,  Dear Brother,  Since the opening of the present academic year, I have visited the Churchschools in Salt Lake Stakes. In the first one of these, I found the Seminary at James E. Brown, Principal, in a very satisfactory condition, there were already in the fourth week of its organization 42 pupils, all of the IV and V Reader Grades in attendance. No Lady-Teacher as yet, but called for since then, and will arrive there, probably next week. Large attendance anticipated for the winter season. Bro. Brown is a great favorite with the people and stake. Academy at Eli A. Day, Principal, has only 16 stu- dents. Bro. Day was not sufficiently familiar with our system, but is a faithful and hardworking teacher. I parted him soon and made arrangements with him and Bro. Brown to meet often and harmo- nize their labors. Both schools in that Stake have separate houses to meet, Huntington ^Seminary^ being somewhat more conveniently fixed than the Stake Academy at Castle Dale. Both Boards are current- ly working for the good of their respective schools.  In Sanpete I had the pleasure in visiting at the inaugura tion of the Seminary at Andrew C.

Duly appreciating the honor thus conferred upon me, I shall endeavor to fill the ap- pointment to the best of my ability.  Very respectfully yours Karl G.

The school is well furnished, occupies two commo- tions classrooms in a house within the Tabernacle-enclosure, and was in fine working order the second day after the inaugaration.  The Gunnison Seminary occupies the Relief Society House, and opened with 28 students but with fair prospects of large increase.  An upper room is being rapidly put into shape for days purposes Both principals of these institutions are earnest and illegible expect most school-wor- kers and are endeavering to make 3 illegible words actions perma- nent intending to settle down this illegible 3 words.  The Stake Academy at Alma Greenwood Principal, has opened with about 25 students illegible of the of the Intermediat and  Academic Grades, with expectations of a large attendance during the coming winter.  Bro. Greenwood is assisted by Bro. Wm. Winter.  The Stake board owns a large building, occupied at present by the District school, but wont take possession next year. The course of studies in the Academy is very creditable to the teachers, both in regard to the spirit, methods, and organiza- tion, as well as to the results.  The Geo. Christensen, Principal, and Miss Augusta Erickson, Assistant, has opened its second school year with but 24 students, of the Intermediate and Preparatory Grades, occupying at present only one classroom Bro. Christensen being one of our best churchschool-teachers, exercises a most beneficent influence over the youth of Mt. Pleasant, and it is only to be feared, that the Authorities there may overload him with too many appointments, on the  ENDENTRY continued  principle of the "willing ox".  Although the Local Board at Manti will have a schoolhouse of its own in another year, when the board of the School-Trustees expires, some assistance will become ne- cessary, in as much as the Presbyterians are erecting a beautiful Academy-building, and propose to fit it up with all the appur- tenances of modern education in order to swamp our Seminary. All the Boards of Education in Peterson at their head, and strongly supported by Apostle Lund, are doing their utmost to advance the cause of their youth.  The Wm. H. Jones, Principal, and Miss Mattie Nelson, Assistant, opened Oct. 13. with 37 students in two Departments, Intermediate and Primary.  The house is well- furnished and reflects much credit upon the energy and good judgement of the Stake Board.  The people of Nephi seem to be  in earnest to support their churchschool.  Bro. Jones is getting quite readily into line with our educational system, in which he is ably supported by Mrs. Nelson, who is as Graduate of the B. Y. A. familiar lady with it.  The attendance at that Academy has increased considerable since opening.  The L.D.S. College 18 Ward Seminary, 14 Ward Seminary, and Central Seminary at the Cottonwoods, have also been visited by me and found in a flourishing condition.  These ENDENTRY four institutions of Salt Lake Stake had a full attendance at the  first day of opening, so that many more refused admittance for want ofo room.  I should suggest that at least two more Seminaries be organized in S.L. City, one in the northwest and one in the southeast, and then another one somewhere over Jordan in the southwestern part of the county, or at Draper.  The new Seminary organized at Parowan, and opened Oct. 13. with Bro Edwin Cutler, Principal, reports very favorable progress and the people of that place seem to be determined to support their own churchschool with all their might.  Many causes have combined this year to create a considerable iregularity in the time of opening of our churchschools, and in the applications for teachers, through which circumstances I have been placed several times into very perplexing situations. With the help of the Lord, however, these difficulties have been over- come thus far, and all our schools with the exception of Kaysville, are now in working order, Al all together.  At a meeting of the Stake Board at Ephraim the question was  raised, if donations should be given rather to the Stake Academy rather to the Temple.  I had no authority to give an answer, and submit it, therefore, to your decision.  It also was proposed at that occasion to divide the appropriation from the General Board with some Seminary, which is also submitted here with.  An objection to lady-students opening or closing the school ENDENTRY continued  with prayer, when students holding the Priesthood are present, has been raised by one of the Principals.  As I have never made any distinction in this regard between male and female stu- dents but have called on them from the list of volunteers for this purpose, I desire to be corrected, if I have been wrong in this.  In conformity with the motion carried at the last session of the General Board to organize our ^#1^churchschools into "District- Conventions" for the purpose of mutual improvement of our teach- ers and of the establishment of greater uniformity in the methods of teaching, I have proceeded in starting this movement; and organized "Districts" recording their geographical position as follows:  1. "Oakley, Randolph, with Bro. John H. Miles as temporary chairman, pending a permanent organization, which will have to determine, times and place of meeting, program, and appointments.  2. "Brigham, L. F. Moench as tem- porary chairman, under above stated regulations.  3.  "Central District"  comprising the churchschools at ENDENTRY B. Cluff as chairman. This district has already permanently organized, and holds its first regular session, Saturday Nov. 8, at Provo.  4. "L.D.S. College, 18 Ward, 14 Ward, and Central Seminaries, Davis Stake Academy, and Kaysville Seminary. This district is also permanently organized with Bro. J E. Talmage as Chairman. First session was held at the College, Saturday, Nov. 1. Committees on Program and on Ap- pointments were made.  5. "Hun- tington, Gunnison, with Bro. Alma Greenwood, as permanent Chairman. They are permanently organized, meet monthly at Ephraim or  Manti alternately, and their Program is also arranged.  6. "Mountain District" comprising the churchschools at A. R. Cutler as temporary chairman. No report as yet.  7. "Southern District" comprising the churchschools in Beaver, M. H. Dalley as tempo- rary chairman. They will meet next week to effect a perma- nent organization.  8. "Arizona District" comprising the churchschools at J. W. Brown as temporary Chairman. No report as yet.  In consequence of the very scattered condition of some of those "Districts", as for instance of Idaho and Arizona ENDENTRY continued.  I have suggested to them to meet perhaps only once a year for a whole week or so, when I should endeaver to meet with them but that they should fill "written appointments" from time to time. Other "Districts" like the "Mountain District", No. 6. might meet quarterly, but the rest will probably meet monthly. I have suggested to them all that, in making up their programs, they should keep in mind the practice in writing Essays, deliver- ing Discourses and Lectures, Practical Exercises in Objectlessons, Classdrills, Demonstrations on different Methods, Questions and Answers, and Reports of their respective schools, and Critics.  It has also been suggested that some kind of an organ of  communication in regard to the doings of these various "Dis- trict Conventions" for the benefit of all under my editorship be selected, and the "Deseret News", the "Juvenile Instructor", and the "Contributor" have been named in this connection. I should be grateful to recieve your instruction on this point.  In conformity with my calendar of travel through the Idaho District, Coalville, and Heber back to Provo, from Nov. 12 to Dec. 132, as submitted to you through Bro. Reynolds, I shall be at Salt Lake City, Wednesday, Nov. 12, and should be glad, if Pres. Thos Ricks could wait for me until then, so that I could  ENDENTRY go with Rexburg, as per ap- pointment. Bro.

Cluff's  of the day previous, has been taken into careful consideration. In connection with the subject in hand I enclose Bro. Cluff's  letter to me the wording of which seem to convey to me a some- what different shade of meaning from the one contained  in the letter to you.  While in the letter to you besides the  churchschool education in general, particular stress is  laid upon the normal training in the Brigham Young  Academy, in the letter to me the "advantages of the Acad- emy" without quedifiation are only mentioned.

Dear Brother,  In conformity with the approved program, I left for  the first circuit of the present schoolyear for Price station  on the D. R. G. Ry, Oct 17, where I was received by a convey- ance from Huntington and taken to the latter place the  same afternoon. Pres. Emery Stake, having made  the necessary appointments for my labors in his stake, I had to leave for Castle Dale early the next morning, in  order to be there at the opening exercises at the Academy. The Principal, Bro. Alexander Jameson, is an earnest worker although in some branches somewhat below the average  qualifications, but diligently endeavoring to make up his  deficiencies. Unfortunately the payment of his salary  is very irregular on account of the financial condition  of the Academy, and he is obliged to own a little  store besides for the support of his family. This is in- jurious to the influence of the Academy, and at the  end of the present acad. year other arrangements in  this regard must be made.  In a conjoined meeting of  the Religionclass Instructors, Sunday School, and  M. I. Association Officers, I took occasion to refer  ENDENTRY credit to their intellectual and spiritual advancement from  our churchschools—it seems to me that the Lord is pleased  with the educational state of affairs in Zion thus far, and  if necessity for further efforts should arise, He would make  it known to you in His own way.  To send out teachers  from one single institution exclusively might have a  tendency to arouse jealousy in others and to break up that harmony of labor to a common end without which  the Spirit of the Gospel cannot be enjoyed.  In regard to the Church School Convention and ex- amination of teachers in Arizona, I shall notify all par- ties concerned, that all these exercises will commence the  day after the closing of the conjoined conference, and  continue the balance of the week.

This  Seminary is in a far better condition, in attendance as  well as in general standing than the Stake Academy. The members of the Local Board are interested in their  school and are making great efforts to run the school  the full year in future. Bro. Jameson as well as  Bro. Wall held their District Convention, attended by  many Sunday School Teachers, mostly, and the  Religion Classes throughout the Stake are reported  in good working order.  Uintah Stake.

College. Wednesday, April was spent exclusively in attending the classes exercises at the B.Y. College. It is with much satisfaction that I can report the fine condition of this College in regard to intellectual pro- gress as well as to spiritual standing and general discipline although it must be stated that it has been somewhat hard at first for Prof. Paul to partake of the spirit of our educational system; in as much as ^during^ the first few months of his labors at the College his usefulness was greatly im- paired by his vigorous participation in the struggles of the political drama and his theological instructions being fixed too much upon the illegible philosphies of the age, both of which mistakes Bro. Paul is mainly striving to overcome. It is to be regretted that by the time this efficient teacher, promising^es^ to become such a valuable co-laborer of ours, willing will leave the educational profession and  ENDENTRY all the branches of This grade, including Kindergartenwork, having rensined  her Normal training and been practical teacher for years in Holland:  I addressed the students of the College in the morning of Thursday, April 27; and left for Franklin, Idaho, in the afternoon.  A meeting of the Seminary Board was held at the Tithing office at 4 P.M., and the same instructions were discussed and unanimnously adopted that had been given at all the Boardmeetings during the previous Circuits.  I regretted exceedingly that the Seminary had closed, and the Principal, Bro. Thomas A. Condie, had left for his home in Morgan City, taking all the records with him in order to straighten them up before June 30.  Bro. Condie has written to me once, promising to have them returned par- ly made out before June 30.  I have also instructed Bro. Joseph G. Nelson, Principal of the Oneida Stake Academy, at Pres- ton, to examine those Records after their arrival, and report to me their condition.  It appears from the statements by mem- bers of the Board that Bro. Condie has not given entire satis- faction, having been any deficient in discipline.  This Seminary Board deserves much credit for their energy in providing a handsome building tolerable well furnished, and they are determined to keep in the lead in educational matters at Franklin, although there is a chance now in Idaho to get reliable trustees and teachers for the districtschools. ENDENTRY by Bro. Robert H. Smith, until the arrival of Bro. John H. Mills, the present Principal, recommen- ded by me for that position by a request of Bp. Johnson, to send someone that could speak  Spanish and understand Music. Bro. Mills has  proved a saviour to the school. The Academy is  crowded, he is assisted by two lady teachers, one of whom is his wife. The latter has to teach the  Primary Dept. in her own home as yet, as the  additions to the building had not been quite  completed. Too much cannot be said of the  devotion of Bp. Johnson, his counselors, and of  the people generally, in making their school a  success. The tuition is free to all the children of  schoolage. They people assess themselves for the  maintenance of the school and the completion  of their conjoined school-and meeting home. The affairs of the Academy were conducted thus  far by a Board of Trustees, previous to the  organization of a Central Board of Educa- tion under the direction of Apostle Teasdale. Tuesday, Nov. 8, we started for Juarez, arriving  at Dublan, about noon the following day.  Here we visited the school kept by Bro. Anson  Call, who followed us up to Juarez for the  purpose of making himself familiar with                ENDENTRY trade his fine talents to law and politics in which pursuits he expects to find more adequate renumeration.

Prof. Paul is ably sustained by his Faculty, among whom Bros. Todd and Apperly de- serve especial montion as the chief standard bearers of the spirit of the Latterday Work in the College. A very pleasing feature of the B.Y. College is the Preparatory Dept. in charge of Sister Hoving, an experienced Lady and Primary Teacher, and fervant Latterday Saint.  Like many other young talented, but ambitious teachers, Prof. Paul was inclined to build up higher classes for scientific and literary pursuits to the neglect of the foundamental branches of education. The objection to such a course does not lie merely in the fact that only comparatively for are prepared to take such courses and the expenses of maintening them would amount in some instances from $150 to $200 for each student per annum, but that such studies require the most eficient teachers of the Faculty, who have to donate their whole time to the instruction of perhaps 10 to 19 students in all, while their labors are taken away from about 200 who are just as much entitled to the benefits of their instructions. In follow- ing up this original inclinations, Prof. Paul intended you to dismiss Mrs. Hoving with her whole department of from 60 to 75 children in order to make room for  ENDENTRY Provo, March 29th 1892  President Wilford Woodruff.  Dear Brother,  In conformity with the program for my fourth circuit, sub- mitted to Bro. Ogden  the same day and met with the Board of Education of Weber Stake at 5 P.M;. ^On the following day, I^ visited the Sunday school of the Second Ward, addressed the public meeting in the afternoon, and the meeting of the Fifth Ward in the evening, on all of which occasions the proper training of the youth and the principles of our educational system furnished me the texts. Monday, March 21, attended the Academy the whole day, met again with the Stake Board after close of school, and ^by request^ gave a lec- ture to the Seventies in the evening. It is gratifying to report that the members of the Weber Stake Board of Education are all active workers in the cause, and under their ju- dicious management that Academy is forging its way to the frontrank among our educational institutions. I made them acquainted with the requirements which, according to the General Circular No. 8, soon to be pub- lished, would constitute a real Academy in our Church- School Organization. They are determined to obtain teach- ers of the required qualifications and grades for next ENDENTRY 2. Oneida Stake Academy. Having arrived at Preston in the morning of Thursday, April 27. I had the privilege of attending all the exercises of the Stake Academy during the day.  As the Principal, Bro. Jos. G. Nelson had been engaged a greater portion of the academic year with princ concerns in order to establish himself permanently at Preston, an Assistant Principal in the person of Bro. David Hanson has been engaged, assisted by Sister Mete Nelson and Neils E li Benson, all of whom were found doing faithful and efficient work.  The records were in excellent order.  Although many of the students have to come daily to school large distances, some of them from 5-6 miles in various kinds of consequen- ces, and even the nearest of them have to walk about a half a mile through sleet, snow, and wind in wintertimes the attendance roll shows a degree of functuality and regularity surpassed only in a few of our churchschools The Academy building is nearing its completion, but the class work has got to be caried on in the basement.

Arriving at  Juarez. Wednesday, Nov. 9, about 5 P.M. we were kindly  visited by Apostle Teasdale, but have to go at once to  the Academy where all the students had been waiting  for our arrival to have the privilege of shaking hands  with us. There were 67 of them, with Bro. Dennis Harris,  as Principal, and two lady-teachers as Assistants. That evening  we addressed by appointment a conjoined meeting of the  M. I. A. the house being crowded to overflowing. The next  day I spent in the school. Bro. Harris has conducted this school at his own risk for several years most successfully and  desires to have his school fall into line with the whole Churchschool Organization. Pres. Teasdale organized  a Central Board of Organization for the Mexican  Mission, and also authorized  Local Boards of  Education to be organized for the Academy at  Dublan, the first two  Boards have sent in their application for recog- nition already, and Dublan will soon follow. There was another crowded meeting at Juarez, that  Wednesday^Thursday^ evening, and the following day,  Thursday ^Friday^ morning, we started on our return trip to  ENDENTRY more academic classes composed of 3 or 4 students each. In my representation of the case to the College Board of Trustees, Prof. Paul was told that the Trustees would find the rooms for Sister Hoving and her pupils, as ^for as^ many as she could get. As Prof. Paul has practically demonstrated his earnest desire to fall into line with our educational system we fast so he can, It would be unfair to criticise too closely the deficiencies in the Records to be kept in every one of our churchschools ac- cording to Gen. Circ. No. 7, page 17, the more so as his pre- decessor, Prof. Tanner has not left them in as complete a condition as they should be. I have Bro. Paul's promise to have them in order by most academic years.  Thursday, April 20, I met with the Trustees of the College, to which meeting  by was attended by my, request by President Orson Smith and his counsellors. The organization of a Stake Board of Education was discussed and effected. The interview was one exceedingly pleasant one and will probably be practive- tive of much good in the educational interest of that Stake. I had the pleasure of adressing that same evening  perounded meeting of studented and patrons of the B.Y. College in the aims and spirit of our educational system.  By special invitation of Apostle Moses Thatcher I par- ENDENTRY year. The Faculty consists of the Principal, three male, and two lady-teachers.

No. 7,  page 18. The Board promised me that this feature should find ample recognition with the begin- ning of next academic year. This Academy has had about 200 students registered during this year, but owing to the late opening will have been in session only 27 weeks iat the end of this academic year. The new Academy-building, although not yet quite finished, is well of arranged for educational purposes, reflecting much credit upon the energy and good judgement of the Board. The Principal and Teachers are earnest workers, and are anxious to fully qualify for their work according to instructions in Gen. Circ. No. 7, pages 5-12.  Box Elder Stake Academy.  According to appointment, I arrived at Brigham City, Tuesday, March 22nd, at 1.30 P.M. and met with President R. Clawson, and another member of the Board, and the Principal, there being no Quorum present. The Stake Academy had closed for the year at the end of the third term, as it was sta- ted to me by President Clawson, on account of too small attendance. I called the attention of the bretheren to the instructions given on the subject in Gen. Circ. No. 7, ENDENTRY them not only saving several hundred hollars of expen- diture, but also obtaining greater comfort to teachers and students.  The great hall will be a magnifcent and reception hall, but as educational auditorium.  There was a Board meeting in the afternoon with full attendance, and the members felt unanimiuously to carry out the instruction given in behalf of the General Board.  The Faculty meeting was also attended by Pres. Parkinson.  The Principalship of this Academy is illegible  of particular illegible just now, in  as much as Bis. G. Nelson, will have illegible 3 words this year his  nomination for his Standing Certificate or finish his Nor- mal course first.  In the latter case the makeshift arrange- ment of our Assistant Principal may illegible to be can illegible for another year.  When that eautiful building will be ready for dedication and illegible in full, it  should not be done on the makeship illegible any more. That same evening I addressed a large illegible in the Ward log homes, and held consultations with the teachers the day following.  Returned with Pres. Parkinson to Franklin where a public meeting was appointed for me in the evening, which was largely attended. Sudnay, April 30, I addressed the Sunday school of  Franklin in the forenoon, and left at noon with the U.P. train for Pocatello, where I had ENDENTRY ticipated in the exercises of the Conferences of the Relief So- ciety and Y. L. M. I Association of Cache Stake during Friday and saturday, April 21. and 22.  Starting for Franklin on the evening of the latter date.  Franklin Seminary.  Mrs. Esther Parkinson having been duly licensed as teacher for the Primary Grade at the beginning of the present academic year, and appointed to conduct a Primary School at Franklin, in lieu of a Seminary, and I, not receiving my report from there for a long time, made inquiries concerning the school. To my surprise I was in formed that the school had discontinued  and the new Seminary building being rent to the District School Trustees. I wrote an explanatory letter to President Parkinson in regard to the mode of procedure in such cases and obtained the promise of proper observance of our regulations for the future.  Oneida Stake Academy. After having participated in the meetings of the Oneida Stake Conference at Franklin during Sunday and  Monday, April 23 and 24, where opportunities two had been given me to urge upon the people the necessity of true education, I left in company with Pres. Joseph F. Smith and Apostles Thatcher for Preston Monday afternoon, where a large meeting was held in the basementrooms of the yet our illegible Academy building. The meeting was crowded to  overflowing and addressed by Pres. J. F. Smith, Apostle Thatcher and Lyman, and myself. The Stake Academy had just closed its session, the previous Friday. ENDENTRY St. Joseph Stake.  I left Deming the same evening for Borine Station at  the Southern Pacific Ry, arriving there near midnight and  took the stage for Thatcher the next morning, arriving  there about 4 P.M. and was very hospitably received  by Pres. Christopher Layton. That day, Friday, attended  the Academy fore= and afternoon. The Principal, Bro. Birdno, his sister. There is  some splendid work done by those two in that Academy,  although is not very largely attended just now, having  recieved quite a backset during the recent political campaigne, the Principal having been away on an sta- tioneering tour through Arizona for four weeks. Bro. Cluff is earnestly endeavoring to fill up his scattered ranks. In a Boardmeeting held on Saturday, many resolutions for the successful carrying on of the Academy and of the Religion classes were adoptive and Pres. Layton manifested a deep interest in  the matter. A meeting of the conjoined M. I. A. and Sunday School Officers concluded Saturday's proceedings. The following Sunday was spent at Pima filling three appointments as usual. ENDENTRY pages 4-5, that such a step should not be taken without consulting the General Superintendent, who is held res- ponsible to the General Board for his permission.  In this connection I feel it my duty to report, that many of our Stake and Local Boards seem to be too in different as yet to the instructions given by the General Board from time to time, and I should suggest, that repeated carelessness of this kind should not be left unnoticed in any appropriation for such a school the following year, or some other impressive remin- der be adopted, in order to emphasize in such cases, the injunctions of the General Board. This complaint refers also to the Church School Papers, published by order of the General Board. Bro. A. Vance, the Principal of the Box Elder S. Academy is a faithful and efficient worker, and he will probably ^make^ his permanent home at Brigham City, which will prove of great advantage to our educational interests in that Stake.  Davis Stake Academy.  Wednesday, March 23rd, being unexpectedly at my dis- posal, the Box Elder Stake Academy, having closed its session, I h a filled out the day by going to Farming- ENDENTRY 3. to address a public meeting by appointment in the L.D.S. Meetinghouse, the congregation being about one half outriders, the building was crowded.  The next morning at 3 o'clock I left by Oregan Short Line Ry. for Minnidoke, where I was taken by Bro. Prim to Albion, Cassin Co. to hold a meeting there in the evening in the Wardmeetinghouse.  Pres. Haight having joined me at Albion, we left for Oakley in the morning of Tuesday, May 2nd, where I had also to address a public meeting in the evening. Cassin Stake Academy Wednesday, May 3rd, was devoted to visiting the Stake Academy in the forenoon.  The Principal, Bro. A. F. O. Nielson, is a young man of much promise, and has done very faithful labors for three years in that Academy. He will take charge the coming school year of the Tooele Stake Academy at Grantsville.  The Stake Superintendent of Education of Idaho, has procured for Bro. Nielson, although entirely unsolicited, a Lifedipls of the First Grade, to teach in any educational institution in the Stake of Idaho, "in appreciation of his ability and efficient labors as an educator."  On this account I am somewhat arry that Bro. Nielsonleaves that state, as his remaining there would have given considerable prestige ENDENTRY Some of the specimens of maps drawn by several students were yet on exhibition around the walls and were the best ever produced of the Land in any of our churchschools. Bro. Joseph G. Nelson, Principal, assisted Miss Mattie Nelson, Pres. Dept. and Ladies Week, and by Bro. John S. Bingham, Pres. Dept. Bro. Nelson has served his second year as Principal and expects to  settle permanently at Preston, finishing his Normal Course as the Logan next year, but retaining his Principalships at Preston with Bro. Bingham as Deputy. This special arrangement was proposed by me and accepted by the Oneida S. Board, in conformity with a similar arrangement for next year at the Sanpete S. Academy The records of the Oneida S. Academy are in perfect order.  Malad Stake Academy. Tuesday, April 26, I arrived at West Portage as per appointment and was hospitably received by Pres. Hoskins, with whom I attended the following day a meeting of the Stake Board of Malad and in the evening a public meeting  Samaria in the educational interest. The former Sem- inary at Samaria has been discontinued for the present academic year and its Principal, joined the Stake Academy at Malad as Assistant Teacher, by mutual ENDENTRY Dublan a few hours to address a  meeting of the Saints there, who unanimously en- dorsed the motion recommendation of the Central  Board to have their school recognized as a churchschool Seminary, with Bro. Anson  Call as Principal. The latter will also apply for  a License under the usual registrations, as also  Bro. Harris, his Assistants, and the lady-teachers at Diaz. We arrived at Diaz, Saturday, Nov. 12, about  3 P. M. just in time to attend the meeting of the Primary. There was also a very crowded meeting of the M.I.A. in the evening. The following Sunday, was occupied  with attending the usual three meetings, at which  the Saints fully endorsed the appointment of a  Local Board for the Academy, and of Bp. W. D. Johnson of Superintendent of the Religion Classes throughout the Mexican Mission. A meeting of the Local Board was held bet- ween the afternoon and evening meetings. Monday, Nov. 14, we started on our return- trip to Deming where we arrived Wednesday,  Nov. 16, about 2 P. M. My most cordial thanks  are due to Apostle Teasdale, Bp. Johnson  and the Saints throughout the Mexican Mission, for the great hospitality shown me; and for the  deep interest they have manifested in our edu- cational movement. ENDENTRY ton with the early train for the purpose of visiting the Woodbury, the Principal, and Miss Woodruff, his Assistant, con- ducting an Intermediate and a Preparatory Depart- ment, comprising 38 students in all, a remnant of about 85, attend that attended during the winter. There is good work done by these two teachers, although Bro. Woodbury, according to his own statement, is lacking as yet somewhat in discipline. I have given him some pointers which, in connection with the instructions he will get in the coming Normal Summer School, may in able him in future to overcome this deficiency. My coming not having been previously known, was not at- tended by any Boardmeeting, but a public meeting in the evening, enabled me to address a large au- dience on the subject of our Church Schools and Religion-Classes.  Morgan Stake Academy.  Tuesday, March 24th, found out at Morgan City, where I spent the evening in conversation with Bro. Geo. J Ramsey, the Principal of the Stake Academy, in order to get posted in regard to the educational condition of that Stake. The attendance at the school has sunk down from 45 to 11, and the Principal reports that the apathy among the people and of some of the ENDENTRY agreement between the Stake and the Local Board Tuesday, April the 26th, spent the whole day in attending the musical at the Stake Academy, conducted by the Principal alone. His school having diminished very much to a great extent, The Assistant Teacher has taken to his farming and saying his last term, leading the Principal alone to conduct all the class of the 3 4 and 5 Readergrades. Bro. Geo Cole is a faithful worker and is improving professionally in a very satisfactory manner. This school is on a solid foundation. The Board contemplates to enlarge the accommendations for the school by proposing a portion of their yet unfinished tabernacle next sum- mer. These improvements can be made at a cour- parstively small expence.  There is yet a very large amount of local jealousy between Ma- lad as to the permanent location of the Stake Acad- amy, which is greatly to the disadvantage of the instututions.  The sooner the General Board would give instructions to have this question definitely settled the better it would be for the educational interest of that Stake. Public meetings at Malad and Portage in the evenings of the Wednesday ^Tuesday^ and Thursday April 26 and 28, h in the interest of our churchschool movement, have not been, I trust, without some beneficial results.  Cassia Stake Academy. Arriving at Minersville in the afternoon of Saturday, April 30, where Pres. extended to me the hospitalities of his home during the time of ENDENTRY Maricopa Stake.  Monday, Nov. 21, I started for Maricopa, via Bowie Station and the Southern Pacific, arriving at Tempe, Wednesday, Nov. 24, where I was received by Pres. Chs. I. Robson, who took me to Mesa City. There was a meeting appointed the same morning, which was largly attended by the Saints and many outsiders. Thanksgiving Day brought on two more mee- tings, and the following Friday was spent in the new Academy. Bro. Robert H. Smith, for- merly of Diaz, is the Principal.  Although Bro. Smith was not familiar with our system, and I had some apprehension before meeting him, I must confess that he has surpassed by far my expectations, both spiritually and intellectually. I had to give him some pointers for his guidance in future, of course, but he is doing good work and carries a good influence with him. He is very humble, teachable, and devoted to his work. Saturday was a meeting of the Stake Board. The three meetings on Sunday kept on growing in attendance, that I was told that in the evening meeting there had been as large a congregation outside on the sidewalk and at the windows as there was inside. The Saints here as well as in the Mexican Mission and in Uintah seem to be spiritually hungry. ENDENTRY leading men is very discouraging, although I found during my visit that all are speaking in the highest terms of the labors of Bro. Ramsey. Bro. Ramsey is assisted part- ly by one of his lady-students as a tutor, and his own classwork, general management and influence is to be commented very highly. At the Board meeting in the afternoon ^of Friday, March 25,^ the general indifference of the people was made conspicuous by the report of the Treasurer, that even leading men were owing yet their tuition for the 1. 2. 3. and 4th year. I suggested to the Board the propriety of carrying on that part of their Academy work upon strict business principles in future, and that the Treasurer in his Annual Financial Statement to the General Board on July 15% should not only state the amount of unpaid tuition but also the number of parties among ^from^ whom that indebtedness was due, for it might perhaps occur to the General Board to ask for the names. That shot will sound secure the payment of the greater portion of the amount, as some leading men ^I dared say^ would sooner pay twice the amount then have their names brought before the General Board, in such a way. As it is very doubtful if the Stake Board will secure the Courthouse at ENDENTRY my stay. The great Fastmeeting the next day was spent with  the rest of the Saints in a four hours' meeting under the in- fluence of the Spirit of God in a very marked degree, when I also found time to perform the duties of my mission. A very pleasant meeting of the Stake Board was held in the afternoon and evening, after which an adjournment was taken to attend a public meeting especially arranged for me. The subject of Religion-Classes formed the chief topic of my remarks. Monday, May 2nd was spent in the Academy. Here the Principal Bro. A. F. O. Nielson conducted the Primary Dept. inclusive of III and IV Readers alone; the larger students, constituting the Intermediate Grade, having had to quit for the 11 term on account of farm work. Outside of the B. Y. College I have seen no where among our churchschools such splendid primary work as there is being done by Bro. Nielson. Although the new Academy building is not quite finished, it is sufficiently so that both stories can be used by the Ac- ademy to advantage. That small Stake, thinly popu- lated, composed mostly of non settlers struggling with the arid soil for a living, calls forth my admiration for their faith and united energy to make their Academy ENDENTRY Left Maricopa ^Phoenix, where I had  the pleasure of an hour's conversation with Governor Zulick,  who appeared to be warm friend to our people. I arrived  at Oakland, Thursday, NovDec. 1st, at 10 P. M. being cordially  received by Bro. John L. Dalton, at 16th Str. Station. The next  day was spent in visiting Saints in Oakland and San  Francisco, and taking a drive to the Cliffhouse in - the midst of a trenching rain. Saturday more visits  and some writing. Sunday two meetings to small congregations with some strangers. Bro. Dalton is  much handicapped in his movements to hunt up some old members of the church in Las Angeles, Sacramento, and other places for want of funds. I started for home, Monday, Decr. 5, and arrived Tuesday night.  Summary.  During this circuit I attended 7 Boardmeetings, 29 Public Meetings, visited 8 churchschools, and organized  several educational Boards, being about from  Oct. 17 to Dec. 6, being 50 days in all.  With kind regards,  Karl G. Maeser ENDENTRY Morgan City for their Academy, ^next acad. year^, it is a matter of very serious concern what to do in case of such a dis- appointment, the more so, as Bro. Ramsey would be willing to make his stay permanent one, if the people should desire it so. Otherwise, Bro. Ramsey would be a valuable acquisition to anyone of our churchschools.  Summit Stake Academy.  Having been previously informed by Pres. W. W. Cluff, that the Summit Stake Academy had closed at the end of the third term with a "handsome attendance and a very creditable examination", I know that I should not have the privilege of visiting the school, but hoped to meet with the Board and with the Principal, and then got some idea of the condition of affairs and of the work done. On my arrival at Coalville, Saturday, March 26, at 6 P.M. I found that the Principal, Bro. Geo. Middleton, had left for his home in the South, and that there could be no Boardmeeting on account of the absence of most of the members. Bro. Middleton is going to withdraw from the educational field as he wants to go east in the fall to study Medicine. I am sorry for this unceremonious way of quitting a labor which that young man has performed to the benefit of his pupils and much credit to himself. ENDENTRY a success. The fortunately Bro. Nielson is determined to leave in spite of the pleadings of the people. He desires to pur- sue his studies for qualifying himself in higher grades I shall be crowded for Principals next year, as several others have given notice to quit for the same reason, and the sufficient supply of qualified persons for such positions becomes excedingly doubtful.  Bannock Stake Academy.  Tuesday, May 3rd found me again on the road in order to reach Market Lake, arriving at my destination Wednesday afternoon, May 4th. President Ricks having met me at Market Lake, and made me comfortable at his house at Rexburg. Thursday, May 5th I spent in visiting the Stake Academy, con- ducted by Bro. Chas N. Watkins, as Principal, and Sister  Barnes, Assistant. The school has registered for this II Term about 75 students, all the way from the Chartclass to the V Readergrade, although of the latter are only a few left, the rest had to quit on account of farming. Bro. Watkins has infused new life into the educa- tional affairs, and so ably assisted by Sister Barnes The great drawback for the further development of this Stake Academy is the schedule refusal of all  the Wards of at the southside of the river to support the Academy in any way either by sending students or with means. This feeling extends to the public meeting and to Quarterly Conferences. When holding meetings by appointment at Eagle Rock, which  ENDENTRY President W. W. Cluff posted me, however, as far as possible wit in regard to the condition of the school, laid before me all the Records of the Academy, to be kept according to Gen. Circ. No. 7, page 17, all of which I found in good order, and stated to me the difficulties with which their Academy had to wrestle from the beginning, having had to change its locality four times already since its organization. There is, however, a prospect of securing either one of two fine houses, well suited for schoolpurposes at comparatively low figures, if they could hope for some assistance in that direction. As in all the other Stakes visited during this fourth circuit, the Religion-classes in Summit Stake have been sadly neglected in some Wards, in consequence of which I arranged with Pres. Cluff to attend their Quarterly Conference. May 11, 12, and 13, on my return from Idaho, for the purpose of explaining to the Bishops that na- ture and mode of operation of this educational feature. Similar arrangements were made in Ogden and Brigham City. Sunday, March 27, I atten addressed a Sun- day School, a Public Meeting, in the afternoon, and a conjoined meeting of three M. I. Associations in the ENDENTRY Provo, December 5th 1893  President Wilford Woodruff.  Dear Brother,  in compliance with a suggestion of President Joseph F. Smith, that I should apply to the respective Stake Presi- dents to send me the traveling expenses, if they desired ^me^ to fill my appointments within their Stakes, as there was no money in the treasury of the General Board of Edu- cation, I have done so and have recieved from all of them already answer in some instances with the ac- companying cash, all the way from Ari- zona.  In conformity, therefore, with my approved pro- gram I started on my circuit around the churchschools of southern Nephi. President Paxman, having to attend court at Provo that same day, had left all necessary instructions with the Justin Call, with whom I spent the afternoon in examining the records of the Academy and getting posted in regard to the educa- tional conditions of that Stake. By special invitation of Pres. Paxman I had the privilege of attending and addressing the beautiful Prayercircle, at Nephi, on Sunday morning, followed by a visit to the Sunday school ENDENTRY evening. Having experienced several chills during the day, Pres. Cluff strongly protested against my star- ting to Park the next morning, de- claring that the heavy storms then raging in the mountains could not be endured by me in the situation I was in, and so I had to cancel my appointment for Wasatch Stake Academy, telephoning to Pres. Abraham Hatch the situa- tion, and returned home, Monday, March  28th, endeavoring to head off any relapse in to Influence, so that I might be ready for Conference.  With kind regards, Your brother in the Gospel, Karl G. Maeser ENDENTRY places at the southside of the river, I took occasion to talk privately with the respective Bishops on the subject, and was surprised at the intensity of the feeling existing in that portion of the Stake. The Bishops declare that it is the unanamimous feeling of the Saints on the south side of the river, that they are suffering for want of spiritual nourish- ment on account of the geographical location of their section of the Stake, and that there be no hope for them until they get organized into a Stake for themselves. Although this feature does not belong to my department for discusion, I have to refer to it as it greatly impedes the progress of the educational work.  The predecesosr of Bro. Watkins having not been very exact in keeping the records re- quired in our schools, Bro. Watkins has great difficulty in straightening up his books, but hopes to have them all in order before opening of the next schoolseason.  7; The reason of above alluded to a quorum of the Stake Board could not be obtained and some informal conversation bet- ween the five members present and myself have in the edu- cational interest had to take its place. Several meetings with the teachers during Friday and Saturday resulted in arriving at a mutual understanding in regard to ENDENTRY This is by far the best organized and conducted Sundayschool which it has been my privilege ever to visit. At the mee- ting of all the Instructors after the close of the school, I explained, by request of Pres. Paxman, the harmony of aim and methods existing between ^the^ Sundayschool Work and the Religion Class Movement, on the basis of the Circularletter on the subject, dated Sept. 12. A discourse in the afternoon meeting, and a lecture to the conjoined M. I. Association in the evening concluded my labors for that day.  Juab Stake Academy  According to the suggestion of Pres. Geo. Q. Cannon, to have our churchschools conducted on the pro rata plan during the present academic year, Bro. Justin D. Call, and his assistant, Miss Mattie Nelson, have assumed all the financial responsibilities of the school, except the fuel, and have met also in this regard with unforeseen success.  The Academy is paying its way very satisfactorily, the attendance being large and constantly increasing.  In the Primary Depart- ment, comprising pupils from the First to the Fourth Grade, inclusive, all seats were taken. This Academy is rapidly passing to the front among our churchschools, and the prospect  is, that the Stake Board will be under the neccessity of enlarging the premises, with the disappearance of the financial stringency just now prevailing everywhere.

During Sunday, I attended Sunday School in the forenoon, and public meeting in the afternoon, as both of which occasions I labored in the interest of the rising genera- tion  Bear Lake Stake.  L. D. S. Seminary at Montpelier. After having filled my appointments made for me by Pres. Eagle Rock, I left the latter place Tuesday, May 10th with the midnight- train and reached Montpelier in the afternoon, Wed- nesday May 11th. The Seminary here has been in charge of Bro. Mary, both of whom are faithful young people, but notyet being graduates, their efficiancy is rather limited in some  respects. It was the best, however, that could be done under the circumstances.  They had to run the Seminary of their now financial risk, but filled the house with about 75 pupils this winter. Bp: Rick and his Associates have succeeded finally to obtain full possession of the grounds and building and contemplatingd to conduct the school the coming academic year in proper shape. We had very pleasant meeting of the Local Board the Seminary. The Seminary had closed, and I found some of the Records in satisfactory condition, and far to balance missing instructed Bos.

Dear Brother,  In consequence of the great diversity in the nomenclature of Grades, Departments, and Classes, in many of our church- schools, a great confusion in this respect had arisen, ma- king an estimate of their comparative standing and labors on my part and a subsequent correct report to the General Board almost impossible. To obviate this difficulty for the future, Church School Papers, No. 20, Juv. Instr. April 15, last, recommended this subject with several others to the consideration of all churchschool teachers, pre- paratory to discussion at our Annual Convention.  The Annual Convention met at the Brigham Young Academy, Provo, August 14, at 11 A.M. The proceedings of that Convention are reported in the Church School Papers, No. 23, Juv. Instr. Sept. 1st. After much discussion of the above stated point, it was decided to refer it to the Board of Examiners for the formulation of a mode of nomen- clature, to be complied with by all our churchschools, as soon that mode of nomenclature should have obtained the sanction of the General Board of Education. ENDENTRY Having addressed by ^according to^ previous appointments a public meeting at Liberty Liberty, I^ arrived at Paris Saturday afternoon. I arrived at Paris the following day.  Bear Lake Stake Academy.  The Principal Bro. John H. Miles informed me that the Acad- emy had closed its sessions for the Intermediate Grades but were running the Preparatory and Primary Departments in charge of himself and Miss Broomhead respectively. Pat- tended the exercises of the Academy dring the whole of Friday ^Monday^, and found that the Preparatory Dept consisted only of 8 students left, and the Primary of 45. Bro. Miles is an earnest worker, his only fault is a lack of gentleness in his dealings with the pupils. Being exceedingly sensitive himself it is strange how he can be so inconsiderate sometimes with the feelings of others. Saturday, May 14th, a meeting of the Stake Board was held at which the numbers manifested unanimously the determination to develop the interests of the Academy and Religion-Classes throughout the Stake. It is impossible to speak in too high terms of the wisdom and personal sacrifice shown by President Wm. Budge in behalf of that Stake Academy, for it became plainly appearent to me that without him that Academy could not have ENDENTRY our youth almost into a general characteristic, impressed itself upon my mind very forcibly by many observations in this regard that evening, and taking as my text "The Fear of the Lord is the beginning of Wisdom", gave them some object lessons on Reverence. This subject I have followed up on many other occasions since then.  Passing through Cedar in the evening, attended Sunday School in the morning of the Sunday, afternoon and eveningmee- tings.  The necessity of a Normaltraining for Sunday School workers was very apparent in Cedar City. An extenuating circumstances in regard to the back- ward condition of their Sunday schools is the pe- culiar occupation of the majority of the people in that region of country viz: The dairy business is ta- king young and old during a great portion of the year into the mountains, thus braking up day-, church-, and Sundayschools; the young people returning late in the fall educationally demoralised, and requiring much time to get them back again into the spirit for studying any- thing.  The Parowan Stake Academy at Cedar City, is conducted by Bro. Holstein Warner, a Graduate of the Brigham Young Academy, and his assistant Miss Sarah Ann Higbee, volunteer teachers on the pro rata plan.  I am happy to report the Academy in excellent condition both in regard to the required ENDENTRY The Board of Examiners met at the Latterday Saint College, September 9th, and after a lengthy deliberation arrived at following recommendation, which are herewith respectfully submitted to you.  1.

I attended Sunday School a Quorum Meeting, and a ^two^ Public Meetings, at all of which oc- casion I had to bear my testimony to the inspired me nature of an educational work. Tuesday, May 17, I left for  Randolph, where I arrived in the evening, and followed an appointment made for me that same evening to address the people in behalf of  The Rich County Academy.  This institution in reality working but a Seminary, and was per- mitted by the General Board with the consent of the Bear Lake Stake Board to assume the title of "Rich County Academy in view of its isolated geographical position, similar to that at Elba, Cassia Stake, where now an  Academy or churchschools building is in progress of erection. The Randolph Churchschool has thus far been permitted to occupy the upperom of the Court- house, but doubts are entertained by the Local Board in regard to the occupancy the coming school- year, which makes the erection of are own school- building a necessity sooner or later.  Bro. Olaf Larsen, the Principal informed me that the school had closed the previous Friday, and that he himself desired to resign. Wednesday a Boardmeeting was held in the afternoon at Woodruff, at which all the members indicated their appreciation of Bro. Larsen's labors with  ENDENTRY records and the spiritual, intellectual, and dis- ciplinary condition.  The Board hopes, that Bro. Warner may make his permanent home in Cedar.  The atten- dance in the Intermediate Department was quite low as yet but a large increase was expected at the begin- ning of the next term. Pres. U. T.

At the meeting of the Stake Board after schoolhours. I learned that a Bro. Williams of Kannab, had been appointed Stake Superintendent of Religion-Classes.  I have since communicated with the new appointee in regard to his duties.  A social meeting of the members of the Board, parents, and students, in the evening gave me an opportunity of explaining the necessity of domestic cooperation in an educational system.

Thursday, May 19th at  o'clock in the morning I started for Ogden, and Salt Lake, in order to be present at the closing exercises of  The Brigham Young Academy Friday, May 20, just 44 years ago the same day that I did graduate. Since my resignation as Principal of that instu- tion I have deemed it my duty to watch the drift of wants there  as closely as time and circumstances would permit. Acknow- ledging to its fullest extent the rapid intellectual progress that institution is making since its occupation of its smudge and well adapted buildings, I look, nevertheless, with serious apprehension upon the financial condition of the Academy and the gravity of the situation may compel the new Principal to curtail to some extent the farreaching shemes which he has in contemplation.  Some general observations made during this and the previous Circuits of the present schoolyear will best brought forth ENDENTRY appreciation to make mention here of that brother's manner in working out in part his salvation. We left Leeds, Tuesday, Oct. 31, and arrived at the latter place toward evening.  A meeting had been appointed for me here, and was listened to by a very attentive audience, although it appears from several observations that neither Sunday school nor M. I. Associations are in an exemplary condition, and the spiritual energy of the people in that place is in a low condition. There were three lamps illuminating the poor apology for a schoolhouse during that meeting.  These lamps were brough't by some people from their homes when they came to meeting.  Wednesday, November 1st  in the afternoon we arrived at St. George. After having attended and addressed the Fastmeeting the next morning, I paid my respects to President David Cannon and to the rest of his colaborers in the Temple, and attended by special invitation a meeting of the district- school- teachers of St. George in the evening.  All of them are interested in the Sundayschools and M. I. Associations, and promised me to take an active part also in the Religion - Classes.  In meeting with the St. George Stake Board of Education the following day, the fact was made apparent, that it was not advantageous to hold the Religion-Classes after ENDENTRY in my report to the Annual Convention, in so much as their general nature entitles them to a more general application throughout our whole Church School Organization.

Maeser end of sideways text ENDENTRY Provo City, March 7th 1893  President Wilford Woodruff.  Dear Brother, Herewith I submit respectfully the report of my labors in the Second Circuit, the program of which had been previously ap- proved of by you.  The Brigham Young Academy, Provo.  After having officially notified the Board of Trustees of this institution of my intended visit to the Academy, I spent two days, Jan. 10 and 11, in attending the various exercises of the institution, and met with the Faculty at the regular meeting, Wednesday, Jan. 11, at 7 P.M. This Academy surpasses all other churchschools not only in the number of its students (over 900 registered up to date) and of its regular teachers (23), but also in the complexity of its organiza- tion and in the amount of labor performed there, in consequence of all of which the influence of that Academy is recognized throughout all the Stakes of Zion. Besides the regular de- partments graded according to Gen. Circ. No. 7, pp. 19 to 21, there are following special organizations: 1. A Kindergarten Class with about 30 little ones under 6 years of age, with a Normal training Class for young ladies to prepare themselves for that particular feature of education. 2. A polytechnic Class for training in practical workmanship. There are over 40 ENDENTRY schoolhours, as the children are then too tired to take  much interest, and especially many boys have to go home to do chores; neither could all the good be ac- complished on Saturdays for the same reasons as re- gards to the boys and many of the larger girls. It was therefore, decided to apply to the School Trustee s to close the district schools one hour at least sooner— one day or two in the afternoon, for the purpose of letting our children have the privilege of going to their Religion-Classes.  This plan has met with much favor everywhere, that it has been adopted thus far since, in Sevier, and Sanpete Stakes. The Stake Academy at St. George has had to suspend operation for this academic year, and Bro. Nephi Savage, the former Principal, has ad- opted a position as teacher in the Districtschools, but has been appointed as Stake Superintendent of Religion- Classes. The same evening I filled an appointment in a meeting at Santa Clara. Saturday, Nov. 4, ad- dressed a conjoined meeting of the M. I. Association of St. George, visited the next morning the Sundayschools, and addressed the meeting of the Sunday Schools. ENDENTRY students waiting to take part, as only about a dozen only are at work just now, on account of lack of facilities. 3. A class for military and physical drill, constituting a complete military organization, fully uniformed and furnished from Camp Douglas with a complete stand of arms. 4. a class in Physical Culture for young ladies with Normal training in that branch of study. 5. A cClasses in Ladies' Work, Plain Sewing, Fancy, and in all other branches in tht line, fully graded. 6. A class in the Fine Arts, with Painting and Modeling. 7. A Music Department, consisting of three grades in Instrumental Music, and in a "Choral Society" for Vocal Music. 8. The Commercial College, with three teachers, just over 50 students. 9.The Normal Department with a four years' course, counting nearly 250 Normal students. 10. The M. I. Association Normal Course. 11. The Sunday School Teachers' Normal Course. In the face of the immense amount of work which this Insti- tution is performing for the benefit of the youth of Zion, it is greatly to be lamented that the Board of Trustees of the Brigham Young Academy finds itself drifting irresistibly towards financial break- ers, that threaten a catastrophe too serious in its results as that such a possibility could be contempleted with equanimity by any lover of our Youth. ENDENTRY at noon; and a public meeting in the Tabernacle in the afternoon, after which we took our de- parture from St. George, having been appointed for on evening meeting at Washington. That mee- ting there was crowded, and Karl Gottfried Maeser|I noticed with much satisfaction the presence and close attention of the younger portion of that community. Monday, Nov. 6 addressed a large meeting in the evening at Toquer- ville. As there are several young people from this and other places in St. George Stake attending the Normal Course for Sunday School, and M. I. Asso- ciation Work at the Brigham Young Academy, at  Provo, a vast improvement in these institutions throughout the Stake is looked forward to after the return of these Normals. I am sorry to state however, that one of them, Bro. Jedediah Larson of St. George, died at Provo last week, of pneumonia. Tuesday, Nov. 7, we arrived in the afternoon at Kannarah, and I addressed as per appointment a large meeting there in the evening.  It would be ridiculous, if it were not too sad, to notice the restraint ^under^ which the young men felt themselves obliged to ^be^ in that place, to behave themselves at least sufficiently during the meeting, in order not to become absolutely offensive.  "You see, Bro. Maeser," so said the Bishop to me, "Stockraising is capacitated to never to be seen in decent society." ENDENTRY Upon the representation of the undersigned, the Stake Presidency of Utah Stake with the consent of the High Coun- sil have organized and appointed a "Stake Board of Educa- tion", to whom henceforth the "Board of Trustees of the B.Y.A." will be held accountable.  This new Board sustained the ac- tionof the last Stake Conference, to suspend for the pres- ent academic year the operation of the "Religion Classes" in this Stake, in order to give the Sunday School Normal Clasa a fair share to demonstrate its thoroughgoing influence for good.  By appointment of Pres. Smoot I filled an appoint- ment in connection with Bp. Springville, while the Principal and teachers of the Academy filled similar appointments in the other Wards of this Stake, in order to educate the people ^up^ to an appreciation of our educational aims.  Sanpete Stake In compliance with appointments made for me by Pres. Canute Petersen for the time I had placed myself at his disposal, I started for Mt. Pleasant, Tuesday, January 17  to address a public meeting in the educational interest that same evening, and to visit the Seminary the next day, and met with the Local Board.  Bro. Geo. Christensen, the ENDENTRY Wednesday, Nov. 8, we returned to Parowan, where the same evening a meeting of the Seminary Board was held, at which the devotion of the members under the wise leadership of Bp. Charles Adams, manifested itself very markedly. The Seminary had opened five weeks before under the Principalship of Bro. Frank Cutler, who has accepted the position under the conditions of the usual pro rata plan, and has gained already within that short time the confidence of the community and of his pupils, so that the attendance at his Seminary is daily increas- ing.  His records are in first class order, and his plans, programs, methods, and general progress of his work very satisfactory, so that he expects to have an assistant before long.  His Sstudents comprise the 6, 7, and 8th grades. Much credit is due to the Seminary Board for fitting up and furnishing the Seminaryrooms in such a handsome and suitable manner.  A reception to address me by the Authorities and People of Parowan in the evening, I completed only in my capacity as a representative of the General Board of Education in whose names I thanked and congratulated them for their appreciation of the aims of that honorable body, and expressing the hope, that ENDENTRY Principal, is one of the ^our^ most conscientious and efficient Intermediate teachers, and as such him to the consideration of the General Board. This Seminary is held in one of the former Ward School Houses, but con- tains only one room, in consequences the students are very much crowded, and soon the engagement of an Assistant Teacher, although much needed, becomes inexpedient. The wise and energetic course of Bp. Lund, the chairman of the Local Board, has made the revival of this Seminary a possibility.  It is questionable, however, if the Seminary will be able to run the   full 40 weeks this year; but the Local Board are determined to make all possible efforts for a full academic year the next time. They could have nearly 200 students willing to attend, if they could ac- commodate them.  Ephraim. Wednesday, Jan. 18, I left for Ephraim with the afternoon train, to address a public meeting in the evening on the usual topic, and to attend the Stake Academy the whole of the following day. Bro. Newton Noyes, Principal, with Bro. John Peterson Assistant, no lady-teacher. In the Intermediate dept, every seat was taken, but the Preparatory Dept. had a small number of students.  This does not reflect, however in a derogatory manner upon the faithful labors of ENDENTRY At the meeting of the Stake Board after schoolhours, the establishment of Religion-Classes on the basis of the Cir- cularletter, was decided upon, and Bro. J. D. Call appoin- ted as Stake Superindendent.  The Recordbook of this Stake Board of Education shows are very punctual attendance of all the members, regular meetings, and comprehensian of the importance of their mission.  By previous ap- pointment Paxman a meeting at Mona, and the following evening at Leban, in the interest of the rising generation and star- ted for Beaver on the day following, where I had the privilege of ad- dressing a large meeting in the Second Ward meeting- house the same evening on the usual topics of my mission.  Parowan Stake  Friday, Oct. 27, I left for Buckhorn Springs by a conveyance from the former place, as I had to address the people there in the evening by appointment from Pres. Uriah T. Jones.  The want of reverences and old age, divine and sacred places, things, principles, and times, and for the Priesthood, which has developed among ENDENTRY Bro. J. Peterson, but it is only the result of the condition of af- fairs, in as much as children of that grade prefer to avail themselves of the free tuition in the District Schools. The school is in a healthy condition, and thePrincipal with  ^and^ his Assistant are much thought of by the Authorities and the People on account of the influence which they exercise both intellectually and spiritually over their students. Manti Seminary: Friday, January 20, I attended the L.D.S. Seminary, at Manti, Bro. Andrew C. Nelson, Principal, and Miss Flora Bean, Assistant. This Seminary occupies its own building, tolerably commodious as far the Intermediate Dept. is concerned, but the Preparatory Dept. is located upstairs, with an outside entrance and a drafty, riggety, and inconvenient staircase leading up to it, forcing teachers and students to go to and fro in all kinds of weather, besides losing a great deal of time, while with a little change in the architecture and comparatively small expense, all these evils could be obviated. The Principal is doing a fine work. I had designed him for the Principalship of the Ephraim, which should have been his proper place, but he concluded to remain at Manti in response to the solicitations and promises ENDENTRY our youth almost into a general characteristic, impressed itself upon my mind very forcibly by many observations in this regard that evening, and taking as my text "The Fear of the Lord is the beginning of Wisdom", gave them some objectlessons on Reverence.  This subject I have followed up on many other occasions since then.  Passing through Cedar in the evening, attended Sunday School  the morning of the Sunday, afternoon and evening mee- tings.  The necessity of a Normaltraining for Sunday School workers was very apparent in Cedar City. An extenuating circumstances in regard to the back- ward conditions of their Sunday Schools is the pe- culiar occupation of the majority of the people in that region of country viz: The dairy business is ta- king young and old during a great partion of the year into the mountains, this braking up day schools, church schools, and Sunday schools; the young people returning late in the fall educationally demoralised and requiring much time to get them back again into the spirit for studying any thing.  The Parowan Stake Academy. at Cedar City, is conducted by Bro. Holstein Warner a Graduate of the Brigham Young Academy, and his assistant Miss Sarah Ann Higbee, volunteer teachers on the pro rata plan.  I am happy to report the Academy in excellent condition both in regard to the required ENDENTRY of the Local Board. It appears, however, that this Board is not able to meet the just expectations, financially, of Bro. Nelson, who therefore, in justice to his increasing family, will have to seek for a better position the next schoolyear. As his case is not the only one among our churchschool teachers, but the number of similar cases is bound to increase with every year, thus placing us in the deplorable condition to give young teachers an opportunity to obtain practical experience in our churchschools for a few years, or as long as they are willing or able to look upon their engagement as a mission, but then have to go into the District School Service for better pay, and we start again with fresh beginners, supplying the District Schools with efficient teachers, and keeping in the rear with inexperienced faces. I again recommend this matter to the earnest consideration of the General Board. Saturday, January 21, I returned to Ephraim, in order to attend a meeting of the Stake Board of Education, at 10 A.M; a meeting of the Religion Class Instructors of the Stake, at 2 P.M; and a meeting of the Church- school Teachers Convention of the Stake, at 7 P.M. It gives me great pleasure to report that meeting of the Religion Class instructors, the only one which I have ENDENTRY records and the spiritual, intellectual, and dis- ciplinary condition. The Board hopes that Bro. Warner may make his permanent home in Cedar. The atten- dance in the Intermediate Department was quite low as yet but a large increase was expected at the begin- ning of the most term. Pres. U. T. Jones has thus far carried a great part of the financial responsibilities of the Board on his own shoulders, a circumstance which I have not failed to remind the people of in my public addresses there. At the meeting of the Stake Board after school hours I learned that a Bro. Williams of Kannab, had been appointed Stake Superintendent of Religion-Classes. I have since communicated with the now appointee in regard to his duties.  A social meeting of the members of the Board, parents, and students, in the evening gave me an opportunity of explaining the necessity of domestic cooperation in our educational system.  St. George Stake.  A Bro. John E. Miller, of Parowan, did volunteer for the third time to take me all the way round between Parowan and St. George.  I deem it a duty of grateful ENDENTRY had the privilege of attending thus far. As Sanpete Stake of Zion has taken the lead in this great movement and is maintaining its prestige in this respect as well as in the number of its churchschools, I cannot speak in too warm terms of the influence for good observable among the young people of that Stake. The Normal Class in the Stake Academy is attended by about a dozen students, who are recognized at the Church Normal Training School, at Provo, as "Junior Normals" as "Normals of the First Year."  From that Normal Class quite a number of teachers have been prepared for the district schools, and are giving general satisfaction. Sunday, Jan.22nd I addressed the Sunday School in the forenoon. Public Meeting in the afternoon, and a conjoined meeting of the M.I. Association in the evening. Gunnison Seminary:-  Monday, Jan. 23 I started for Gunnison, to attend a meeting of the Local Board at 5 P.M. and a public meeting at 7 P.M. in the interest of their Seminary. The following day was spent in the most part at the Seminary, which is held in the nicely fitted up upper room of the Relief Society building. Bro. John T. Miller, Principal, without any Assistant.  Unfortunately, the exercises were much interfered with by many visitors crowding in notwith- ENDENTRY appreciation to make mention here of that brother's manner in working out in part his salvation. We  left Leeds Tuesday, Oct. 31, and  arrived at the latter place toward evening. A meeting had been appointed for me here, and was listened to by a very attentive audience, although it appears from several observations that neither Sunday school nor M. I. Associations are in an examplary condition, and the spiritual energy of the people in that place is in a low condition. There were three lamps illuminating the poor apology for a schoolhouse during that meeting. These lamps were brought by some people from their homes when they came to meeting. Wednesday, November 1st in the afternoon we arrived at St. George. After having attended and addressed the Fastmeeting the next morning, I paid my respects to President David Cannon and to the rest of his colaborers in the Temple, and attended by special invitation a meeting of the district-school-teachers of St. George in the evening. All of them are interested in the Sunday schools and M. I. Associations, and promised me to take an active part also in the Religion-Classes. In meeting with the St. George Stake Board of Education the following day, the fact was made apparent, that it was not advantageous to hold the Religion-Classes after  ENDENTRY standing my request of the previous evening, to leave me alone with the school in the forenoon, so that I could get a chance to see its every-day working. It is my custom every- where to address the students during last half hour or so in the afternoon, at which occasion the mem- bers of the Board and patrons of the school are welcome, but not before. According to all appearance, Bro. Miller is a faithful worker and will grow to be a valuable acquisition to our corps of teachers.  There were 45 students of the 5th and 4th Readergrade registered.  Sevier Stake  For this Stake I left Monday ^Tuesday^ Jan. 234, with the afternoon train, addressed that same evening a public meeting in Salina, and on the following evening one at Glenwood where I was joined by Pres. Seegmiller.Wednesday ^Thursday^, Jan 26,  left for Stake Academy for several hours, and met with the Academy Board. At the latter meeting, it was concluded to have the labors of the Academy Board separated from the Stake Board and steps to that effect were taken by the Stake Presidency. The Stake Academy is presided over by Bro. Marinda Halliday, both teachers of a high order. 1500 students registered, among whom 17 Normals of the Junior Grade. ENDENTRY schoolhours, as the children are then too tired to take much interest, and especially many boys have to go home to do chores; neither could all the good be ac- complished on Saturdays for the same reasons as re- gards to the boys and many of the larger girls. It was, therefore, decided to apply to the School Trustee's to close the district schools one hour at least sooner— one day or two in the afternoon, for the purpose of letting our children have the privilege of going to their Religion-Classes. This plan has madeet with much favor everywhere, that it has been adopted thus far since, in Sevier, and Sanpete Stakes. The Stake Academy at St. George has had to suspend operation for this academic year, and Bro. Nephi Savage, the former Principal, has ac- cepted a position as teacher in the District schools, but has been appointed as Stake Superintendent of Religion- Classes. The same evening I filled an appointment in a meeting a Santa Clara. Saturday, Nov. 4, ad- dressed a conjoined meeting of the M. I. Association of St. George, visited the next morning the Sundayschools, and addressed the meeting of the Sundayschool teachers ENDENTRY There is a prospect that this Academy may succeed in serving a permanent Principal with the beginning of next school year, "a consummation devoutly to be wished" not only here but also in the other churchschools.  By appointment of Pres. I filled appointments in the educational interest at Joseph, during the time from Friday, Jan. 27 until Monday, Jan. 30, on which day I left for Beaver, where I had a preliminary meeting with the Stake Board andon  Tuesday, Jan. 31.  On Thursday, Feb 2nd met with the High Council of Beaver Stake at which occassion a "Stake Board of Education" was appointed, as the Academy Board has incorporated under the laws of the territory, and its members are under bonds.  Parowan Stake.  Friday, Febr. 3rd I left for Parowan, where I had to stay until Tuesday, Febr 7 in the morning when I left for Cedar City.  During my stay at Parowan I met with the Local Board of the Sem- inary, addressed the Sunday School on Sunday morning, and public meeting in the evening and one in the after noon. Monday, Febr 6, attended the Parowan Seminary, Bro. Jos. A. Sill, Principal, but no Assistant.  Bro. Sill is an energetic young man, very much desirous of improving ENDENTRY at noon; and a public meeting in the Tabernacle in the afternoon, after which we took our de- parture from St. George, having been appointed for an evening meeting at Washington that mee- ting there was crowded and I noticed with much satisfaction the presence and close attention of the younger portion of that community. Monday, Nov. 6, addressed a large meeting in the evening at Toquer- ville As there are several young people from this and other places in St. George Stake attending.  The Normal Course for Sunday School and M. I.

I am sorry to state however, that one of them, Bro. Jedediah Larson of St. George, died at Provo last week, of pneumonia. Tuesday, Nov. 7 we arrived in the afternoon at Kannarah, and I addressed as per appointment, a large meeting there in the evening. It would be ridiculous if it were not too sad, to notice the restraint ^under^ which the young men felt themselves obliged to ^be^ in that place, to behave themselves at least sufficiently during the meeting, in order not to become absolutely offensive.  "You see, Bro. Maeser," so said the Bishop to me," Stockraising is capacitated to never to be seen in decent society." ENDENTRY improving himself in his profession but being unfamil- iar with our educational system, has had a great many difficulties to content with at first, from which he has extricated himself very creditably in a great measure. There seem to be many evil influences bearing upon the young people all through Parowan Stake, which is to be accounted for to some extent by the dairy- business which takes the young people into the mountains a great portion of the year, during which time they seem to be left without guidance or restraint.  Our teachers have a hard time of it in such neighborhoods.  I left Parowan, for Cedar, Tuesday, Febr. 7 in the morning and addressed a large congregation at the Tabernacle in the morning. Next day, Febr. 8 attended the Stake Academy, Bro. Mary Middleton, Assistant.  Bro. McCarty is a very efficient teacher, of a College training, and a splendid disciplinarian. I have  some misgivings as to his spiritual standing as he is the offspring of an apostate family, but have been most agreeably disappointed.  Bro. McCarty has had the difficult problem to solve, to build up a school that had been going down to the very verger of  ENDENTRY Wednesday, Nov. 8, we returned to Parowan, where the same evening a meeting of the Seminary Board was held, at which  the devotion of the members under the wise leadership of Bp.

Some minor details in method in order to harmonize his labors more with those of our other churchschools belong to our mutual correspondence.  There are about 120 students re- gistered.  After the close of the Academy exercises, a Board- meeting was held, at which it was concluded to organize a Stake Board of Education, in order to avoid in future that deplorable condition of "Local Jealousy" that in so many instances already has obstracted the best interest of our  educational organization.  St. George Stake.  Thursday, Febr. 9, started for St. George, via Leeds, and arrived at my destination Friday, the 10th at 4 P.M. After having attended during Saturday a meeting of the High Council of the Stake in the forenoon, and a funeral in the afternoon, I spend the morning in consultation with Pres. Nephi Savage about the Stake Academy affairs. Sunday, Febr. 12th found me addressing the Sundayschool in the morning, a public meeting in the afternoon, a Wardmeeting in the evening, and by special invitation a meeting of the District School Teachers after the Wardmeeting.  Monday, Febr. 12, was ENDENTRY a turn in the financial affairs of our people would enable the General Authorities of the Church to ren- der such assistance to our struggling churchschools, as they so much desired to be able to. Being met at I ar- rived at the latter place, Friday, Nov. 10.  Beaver Stake  The Stake Academy building at Beaver is now under roof and is presenting an imposing appearance from the outside.  It consists of two stories, containing an entrance with room for a flight of stairs and a small office, two classrooms down stairs, and a large assemblyroom upstairs with a landing outside. Bro. Shepherd has charge of the building work and expects to get it all finished before spring.  Saturday, Nov. 11, I attended a meeting of the Primaries conjoined, and a meeting of the Religion-Classes. Reinhard Maeser, being Stake Superintendent of the latter. There was a meeting of the Stake and of the Local Board of Education held at the Tithingoffice that evening, at which the earnestness of the members in their endeavor to make their church school system a success was demonstrated beyond a doubt. Sunday, Nov. 12. visited in com- pany with Pres. White and my son Reinhard, the Sundayschool Superintendent, the three Sunday- schools of Beaver, and addressed a Sunday School ENDENTRY in the Stake Academy, where Bro. Savage is assisted by Bro. Charles H. Miles. It is a pity that such excellent work has to be done under such unfavorable almost unwholesome conditions. Bro. Savage deserves special commendation for his devotion to our Church School Organization and his Stake Academy in particular. He has labored now five years in that position in St. George under sometimes very discouraging cir- cumstances.  In appreciation of his devoted labors, the members of the Board have secured him now a desirable home upon their own personal soverinty. The following day a meeting of the Stake Board was held, at which it became apparent, that there was no need for the present for organizing a separate Stake Board.  During that day, I also visited the District Schools, and paid my respects to Pres. McAllister and the other brothern at the Temple, spending several hours with them with much profit to myself. In the evening went with Pres. Santa Clara and addressed a large meeting there, returning to St. George the same night.  Wednesday, Febr. 15, went with Pres. McArthur to Leeds, where we held a large meeting in the evening. Thursday, Febr. 16, I parted with Pres. McArthur, starting for Kanarah, where the same evening a large mee- ting was held the next day I started for Beaver, via ENDENTRY Teachers meeting at noon on the subject of the "Guide" and the Sunday School Normal Course, at Provo, as this Stake has as yet no representative at the Normal Course. Addresses in the afternoon meeting and ^at^ the conjoined M. I. Associations in the evening, concluded my labors in I started the following morning via Cove Creek to  Sevier Stake.  Arrived at Joseph City in the evening of Monday, Nov. 13, and addressed there a large meeting on the usual topics, leaving the next morning for Monroe, where a meeting was held at 1 P. M. The district schools adjourned for the session and filed into the meetinghouse under the leader- ship of their respective teachers, one of whom a gentile lady, and occupying reserved seats.  The Methodminister came on the stand after the meeting and thanked me in behalf of himself and the children for my instruc- tions on "Reverence."  That same evening I addressed a crowded meeting at Elsinore. It is very gratifying to me to notice in all the places mentioned in this report, that former students of the Brigham Young Academy, are honoring their former training ENDENTRY via Cedar City, Iron County, Utah Territory|Cedar and Beaver, Saturday, Febr. 18, in the afternoon.  Sunday, Febr. 19, as usual I had to address the Sundayschool, and after that a meeting of the Sundayschool teachers, in the afternoon a public meeting, and in the evening a Conjoined meeting of the M. I. A. Tuesday, Febr. 21, started with Pres. Minersville, where I addressed a public meeting in the morning in the interest of the rising generation.  Millard Stake  As I have not visited either of these stakes althoug belonging to this circuit,  it is my duty to state here the reason for this omission.  After some fruitless endeavors to secure a Prin- cipal for Panguitch Stake Academy, I succeeded in obtain- ing a candidate for the position upon the recommenda- tion of Prof. Talmage. The person, however, did not suit Pres. Crosby and was dismissed by him after 5 weeks labor.  Thus was brought the acad. year for that Academy to a sudden end. There is a L. D. S. Seminary, at Escalante, of the same stake, in a flourishing condition, and a petition from that Local Board, en- dorsed by Pres. Crosby in behalf of the Stake Board is herewith enclosed. The Principal of that Seminary, is a ENDENTRY and taking an active part in the spiritual work of their respective communities.  There are a few exceptions and they'r in every instance, are avoiding to meet me. During all Sevier Stake I had the privilege of enjoying the company of Bro.

President Wilford Woodruff, Dear Brother,  Out of the forty churchschools that hadve been organised  since the establishment of our Churchschool System  only fifteen have been in operation during the last  schoolyear.  The reasons of the closing down of so many  churchschools have been twofold.  the first is the finan-  cial inability of the Boards of Education to continue  their schools without some appropriation either from  the people or from the General Board, and the  second is the inability of the teachers to continue  their labors any longer at the pro rata plan, as the inducements to enter the districtschool service  for better salaries became too strong for some. Although several were holding on as long their  circumstances would allow, and a few are  yet faithful to us at the same rate. The schools in operation during last year are as  follows:  1. Brigham Young Academy, Provo, Utah County, Utah Territory|Brigham Young at academy, Provo, Prof. B. Cluff. 38 weeks.  2. W. J. Kerr. 38 weeks.  3.  Willard Done. 38 weeks.  4.  L. F.

In addition to them I have to report that the Local Board of Huntington Seminary is desirous of re- opening their Seminary the coming season.  No there  is no prospect that the Stake Board of Emery  ever will do anything in the matter of Educa- tion, and the Local Board at Huntington  is manifesting much interest and energy, I  should suggest, that the latter ^should) be accepted  as the Stake Academy.

ENDENTRY Salt Lake City, Febr 10, 1897.  President Wilford Woodruff. Chairman Gen. Board of Education.  Dear Brother,  Since my last report of October 10, 1896 I have visited the  Latterday Saints College; Salt Lake City, Weber  Stake Academy, Ephraim besides held meetings with Religion Classexercises in many  Wards of Sanpete and Cache Stakes.  It is my pleasant duty  to report a reawakening of the interest in our educational  systems both in regard to Churchschools and Religion Classes not only in the two Stakes named but also in a great  many other Stakes.  This statement is based partly upon  my own personal observation and partly upon my extensive and continuous correspondence.  And these colleges are doing very satisfactory professional  work.  The Brigham Young Academy at Provo is a model institution especially in the socalled Training school. since this division of the Academy is occupying its new  quarters. I suggest, however, that the ^draft for the^ new plan and Circular  for the next schoolyear be submitted first to a Committee of the of the Local Board for review and approval ENDENTRY Highschools. In addition to the already existing  three Colleges, that should represent the climax  of our educational organization, I should re= spectfully suggest the establishment of same, Highschools with the necessary three years' course, on a plan similar to the one published as  suggested thus far by the Territorial Teachers' Convention of Oct. 6, 1894, with such modifications  as the General Board may deem proper to make. I suggest that the Stake Academi'es at Pres- ton, and Ephraim be enabled to organized in  that way.  Board of Examiners. The appointment of Dr. Talmage  as President of the University of Utah makes his con- tinuance as a member of the Board of Examin- ers inexpedient in several respects, and if the  General Board should decide that dby this  appointment of Dr. Talmage a vacancy in the  Board of Examiners had occurred, I should  suggest that Dr. J. M. Tanner, a former mem= ber of said Board, be reinstated.  Appropriations. Realizing fully the conditions that have made appropriations  for our churchschools  well nigh impossible for the last year or two,  I approach this subject with great reluctance. But knowing the vast influence for good amoung  our rising generation that has been accom= plished thus far already by our church= schools, I feel it my duty, to present to the Gen= eral Board the necessity for some steps by ENDENTRY The Logan is doing excellent work as far as it is able to, being subject to great inconve- niences in regard to no recommendation.  Since the  partial adoption after my repeated urging, of the  theological, domestic, and moniterial systems, this  College is now in l completely in line with the spirit and mind of the General Board.  This statement refers merely to the faculty as I had no opportunity to meet with that Local Board.  The Latterday Saints' College  is doing as good work as far as its present plan objecties, the incovenient accomodations, and the uncer- tainty in regard to its future condition will permit. There are three Stake Academies that henceforth should be definitely reorgnized as Highschools and have their charters changed accordingly.  This step is appropriate  on account of the work done by them and the in- fluence they are exercising. These Academies are the  Stake Academies at Ogden. The Stake Academies at Rexburg, and Diaz are doing very satisfactory Intermediate and Primary Grade work, while the Academies at  Mesa City are still laboring under make shift arrangements.  The Seminary at Huntington has had  a very satisfactory run for two terms this schoolyear. This makes 14 churchschools in operation at present.  Bro. Geo. Reynolds and myself were appointed at  the October meeting of the Gen. Board a Committee to reviw Gen. Circ. Nos. 7 and 8 in accordance with the  requirements of the advanced conditions of our  Church School Organization.  In commencing our  labors for this purpose we soon discovered that ENDENTRY Salt Lake City, Oct. 10. 1896.  President Wilford Woodruff. Dear Brother,  I herewith submit to you and the General Board of Education the statistical report of our churchschools for  the academic year 1895–1896, ending June 30th last. A financial report could not be made out as not all  schools have reported their financial condition, and  some gave only approximate statements.  A general review of our churchschools based partly upon my personal observations and partly upon re- ports from the respective Boards and faculties has  given the following results for the past schoolyear:  I. Schools.  There have been in operation: 3 Colleges, 12 Stake  Academies, and 1 Seminary,. They were distributed 2 3 in Mexico.  II Teachers.  There have been 86 teachers laboring in our church- schools during the past year, ^of^ whom 8 hold academic  diplomas, 18 intermediate certificates, 55 annual li- censes, and 5 special licenses. ENDENTRY by  which ^not only^ the closing down of some more of our  churchschools can ^may^ be averted, but also the reo- pening of those now closed facilitated, and the  establishment of new ones encouraged.  Permanency of Teachers' engagements. It is very  gratifying to me to report that my endeavors  to convince Boards of Education of the great ben- efits of permanent engagement of faithful and efficient teachers, have been effectual in  several instances, in as much as the Principals  of our churchschools in Salt Lake, Emphraim, and some of  leading teachers have been laboring in their  respective positions for several years, and are  not desirous of any change.  To encourage this  beneficant condition, I should suggest the  plan, that at some furture time a portion of  the annual appropriation made by the General  Board for our churchschools be set apart  as a premium for such teachers of ours, as have remained five years in our service. This premium might be correspondingly increased at every fifth year afterwards, until a certain worthiness for the respective  teacher's grade be reached.  Circular No. 9 and Letterheads.  The Board of  Examiners have revised Circulars No. 7 and 8,  as instructed by the General Boards, and the  manuscript can be made ready for print  as Circular No. 9, whenever the General  ENDENTRY more interpolations and incidental changes in the existing  copies of Circulars Nos. 7 and 8 would prove entirely insufficient  especially in regard to the requirements for examination of  teachers for the various grades, and to the outlines of studies. There will have to be interpolated a whole course of studies  for the Highschool Grade, and the Collegiate courses  have also to be greatly revised.  I suggest respectfully that these alterations be furnished every churchschool in a typewritten copy and published for general  information in the Church School Papers as fast as  they are required.  The Board of Examiners have held several meetings and have a large lot of applicants for examination in the several grades before them.  They propose to  hold in future one examination for all such applic- ants.  This examination to be held shortly after the  schools have closed that is at the latter part of June. I should suggest also the holding of a Church School  Convocation during one week at the same time with  the examinations, place, time, and details to be  determined by Committees appointed by the Gen. Board.  Since the publication of the "Outlines for Religion Class ENDENTRY III Studies.  there have been 54 different branches taught in 643 classes. Some of the latter recited 5 times a week, some 3  times, and some twice.  IV Students.  The total number of students reported as having at- tended our churchschools during the year is 3112, of  whom 1825 are males, and 1287 females. They were re- gistered as 447 Primary Dept; 443 Preparatory; 1016 Inter- mediate; 76 Commercial; 428 Academic; 672 Normal; leaving 20 unaccounted for.  V Board of Examiners.  In consequence of the appointment of Bro. J. M. Tanner as President of the Agricultural College, his illegible illegible by the General Board of Examiners becomes inconsis- tent and conflicting, in as much as he is now exofficio a member of the Stake Board of Examiners, and the vacancy thus occasioned should be filled by some  one else.  The Board of Examiners held four regular meetings  during the first year, and its members have been en- gaged in examining canidates for diplomas and  certificates, some of these examinations are still  pending.  Following points from the minutes of the last mee- ting of the Board of Examiners are herewith respect- fully submitted for the consideration of the  General Board of Education:  1. Bro. Wm J. Kerr moved the recommendation  to the General Board that in cases where persons ENDENTRY Board should desire to order its publication. In consequence of my extensive correspondence, my supply of large letterheads has been exhaus- ted for a long time, as also are the blanks for  Statistical Reports. Both items are of some  importance in the transaction of our running  business, and I would respectfully ask for  a new supply.  Uintah Stake Academy,  at Vernal, will reopen  again this fall, after having been closed for one  year. The Board there have erected an addition  to their original Academybuilding, consisting  of a large classroom and a Principal's office. Their  indebtedness amounted in all $695 00, which  since last Sunday, they expect to cancel  within a week or two by private donation. The people of Uintah Stake are very enthusiastic  for their Academy.  Religious Classes. It gives me great pleasure to  report the Stakes of Beaver,  and Box Elder, as energetic and faithful in the maintenence of the Religion Class move- ment, although even there many obstacles,  consisting chiefly in the indifference of the  authorities toward it, have to be overcome. In some Stakes the presiding authorities are  positively against it notwithstanding my  endeavors to plead the cause.  Gen. Supt.'s visits and labors. Not having any funds to defray traveling expenses to the various church- ENDENTRY Work, a copy of which accompanied by a Circular letter  of Dec. 15, was sent to every Stake Presidency in Zion, the  Religion Class movement has taken a fresh start. Of the 37 Stakes 18 have answered in the affirmation and  I am in communication with their respective Stake  Superintendents of Religion Classes, answering questions, sending and recording Licenses for Instanctors, and  sending copies of "Outlines."  10 of these 37 Stakes have re- ported that they could not see their way clear for the present to introduce these Religion Classes, and 9 have  not answered at all as yet.  As it will be necessary for me to visit all those  Stakes in the first place that have responded to  the call for introducing Religion Classes, in order  to demonstate by classexercises and explainatory ad- dresses the nature of these classes, and also to urge  upon the people the necessity of sustaining our  churchschools—the traveling expenses begin to be  a point of serious consideration.  My district of labors  extends from Alberta to Juarez Stake, and I have traveled all that distance thus far at the expense of the  Deseret Sunday School Union as I combined my labors  in that organization with those of the Church School interest.  But these Religion Classes require my visits at times when I cannot combine them with the Sun- day School work.  I submit, therefore, your instructions in  this matter.  Your brother in the Gospel, Karl G. Maeser. D. S. D Gen Supt. ENDENTRY have completed courses and received the bachelor's degree  from an institution of recognized standing, the  Board of Examiners may at their discretion accept diplomas in lieu of examination, and recommend  to the General Board the issuance of certificates to teach  in any school of the church, and that such certificates should entitle such individuals to similar recognition  as accompanies a churchschool degree.  2. Bro. Benj. Cluff moved that college cheers be restric- ted to special occasions and under proper regulations.  VI. Circulars.  General Circulars Nos. 7. and 8. have become absolute in  some points and a revision of them is indispensable. I should recommend the appointment of a com- mittee for that work with instruction to report at  an early date.  VII. Religion Classes.  I herewith submit also the draft for a Circular respec- ting the conduct of Religious Classes, for the purpose  of better regulating that much needed future of our ed- ucational system.  Karl G. Maeser Gen. Supt L. D. S. Schools ENDENTRY Provo, May 11, 1895.  President Wilford Woodruff.  Dear Brother, The first Presidency being too busy last Thurs- day to hear my report and to give me some  much needed instructions in regard to our  churchschool affairs, I feel it Amy duty to ad- dress you in writing on some of the most  pressing subjects that need immediate at- tention.  1. Referring to Pres. Cannon's instruction to  me in regard to Dr. Talmage's retirement from  the Board of Examiners, I report, that I  had an interview with Bro. Talmage on  the subject. He stated to me that he had of- fered his resignation from the membership in that Board to the First Presidency but  that it had not been accepted,. He would  prefer now to remain until the question  of the conferring of degrees and diplomas  by any of the churchschools would have  been settled definitely in accordance  with the decision of the General Board  of Education. He understood that Prof.  Cluff was determined to issue degrees  and diplomas this coming commence- ment to his graduates in spite of the  General Board ENDENTRY schools, I have endeavored to unite my visits to  them as much as possible with my travels in  the Sundayschool interest, and have met with  Boards of Education and Localties, held  public meetings on the subject wherever a chance presented itself. Besides this a very  extensive correspondence has been carried  on constantly, so as to enable me to keep track of the conditions of Boards and Schools. I find that some Stakes have thus far paid  no regard at all to the Circular of the General  Board of Education, of June 8, 1888, as far  as the organization of a Stake Board is concerned, and others that have organized once, have  suffered ^it^ to drop out of sight again. If all the  General Conference next October, or in some other way the First Presidency would urge upon their Stake Authorities the impor- tance of this move, it would prove a great stimulus to our works.  With kind regards,  Karl G. Maeser Gen. Supt ENDENTRY 2. In order to ascertain the truth of Bro Talmage's  statement Cluff  last night at his office and obtained from  him following answer: He had just  returned from an audience with the  First Presidency, who had approved of his  propositions. What those propositions  had been, Bro. Cluff did not inform  me. In regard to the bestowal of de- grees and diplomas he was resolved  to bestow them as he had done for  the last three years. When I reminded  him of the discussion on the sub- ject in the last meeting of the General  Board and the decision arrived at then, and that I would furnish him an  extract on that point from the minutes,  I said that he did not care for those  minutes, and that nothing but a  written injunction from the First Presi- dency could stop him.  3.

President Wilford Woodruff.  Dear Brother,  Suplementary to my synopsis of the statistics for the academic year submitted to you under date of Oct. 3rd, I beg leave to make following additional statements:  Churchschools discontinued since close of schoolyear:  Seminaries: Central, 18th Ward, Huntington, and Malad, Vernal = Total 11.

Talmage's letter of Nov. 17,  addressed to you, containing his request for your permission to have the sug- estive outline for a "Course of Study for  the High Schools of Utah Territory" dis- tributed among our churchschools for  the purpose of obtaining suggestions from  our teachers. He also proposes to have  this course after its final adoption by  the Legislature followed by our church  schools for the sake of harmonious  education in the secular branches.  I have had this matter under con- sideration for some time, have stu- died the "Outline" over very carefully  ENDENTRY 2. has placed me as your agent in such  cases, especially as far as the Brigham Young Academy in Provo is concerned,  into a delicate, uncertain positions and  forcinged me to pursue a hesitating and  passive course, to which an entire release  from all connection with that institution  would be far more preferable.  4. Bro. Cluff informed me also that he had  engaged with the full approval of the  First Presidency, Ogden as  Professor. Having been under the painful necessity of investigating that man Phillip's  conduct in Bear Lake, Ogden, and Provo, while he was in the churchschool service, and having found him entirely unworthy to be an instructor of our youth, I most  emphatically protested against such an  engagement. Bro. Cluff told me, that  Phillips had been rebaptised and so forth. Knowing the character of absolute unrelia- bility of that man, that state of his does  not go far with me, although I shall  give him the benefit of my best wishes  and hopes for his reformation. I do  not think it is wisdom to place that  man, so soon after his repentance, as an instructor in the leading church  ENDENTRY Provo City, Sept. 15, 4. President Wilford Woodruff.  Dear Brother,  On my returning from my California Mission  last month, I found the statistical reports from  many of our churchschools still missing not withstanding the repeated reminders that have  been sent into all directions. There are still a few  lacking making it impossible for me to submit  to the General Board of Education a complete  summary of our Church School Organisations  for the academic year 1893-1894.

In consequence of which neglect, several churchschools have closed down that could have been saved with comparatively little effort and the Religion-Classes received no attention  at all.  Teachers.  Not too much can be said in praise of many of  our churchshoolteachers, who have carried their respective schools during the last two years not only at their own financial risks at great sacrifice, but also in some instances without any encourag- ing word on the part of their respective Boards. We are losing this year a majority of our best intermediate teachers that have to enter the District School Service, not being able to hold out any longer without the necessary financial and moral support.  Revision of Gen. Circ. Nos. 7 and 8.  The discontinuance of the Church University and the changes in our Churchschool Organisation, as set forth in the "Official Announcement" of Aug. 18, last, are making changes in Gen. Circ. Nos. 7 and 8 indispensable, in as much as in the administration of our affairs constant reference to there guides has to be made.  ENDENTRY and will have to suggest some alter- ations as far as our Stake Academies  are concerned. I have also sent  copies to several of our prominent principals and teachers with  the request to let me have their views on the subject.  Thus far I am prepared to state, that a somewhat similar plan will have to be followed by our  Stake Academies in the future or  else we should be left behind  and the secular "Highschools"  would absorb our more ad- vanced students. The consequence of this would be a retrogradation  of our schools to the level of dis- trictschools. Instead of branches  proposed on that "Outline", that  are not essential in our eyes, I should  recommend branches in Technics (or Manual Labor) for both sexes, and  instructions in Agriculture and Horti- culture.

Woodruff for his approval  as churchschool teachers.  5. A meeting of the General Board of Edu- cation at an early date would be most  desirable, as the condition of our Stake  Academies requires some steps to be taken  in order to place them upon as per- manent basis and raise them to the  Highschool standard, without which  our whole educational system would  be swamped by the new order of things  at the approaching statehood.

As in consequence of your injuction to the Principal there degrees could not be conferred, but only a very serious dis- appointment would ensure to the  poor young ladies and gentleman, but would also demonstrate a con- flict between the General Authorities and the Faculty of this Academy, which could prove very detrimental to the institution, therefore!

Dear Brother,  During Mexico,  Colorado, that the Saints were desirous more  than ever for the advantages of one church school edu- cation. In consequence, therefore, the Juarez Stake  Academy takes the lead among the four churchschools  in Mexico, namely at Dublan, and Pacheco. The  Juarez Academy will soon be ready to occupy the new and commodious premises provided for here by the  energy and devotion of the authorities and people  of that flourishing community. All the teachers of these  schools are duly authorized by the General Board, either  by diploma or license, those of the latter class will  pass their examinations for standing certificates  during the summervation before Profs. Geog C. Wilson  and Charles R. Fillerup, who have been appointed  under certain regulations as deputies of the Board of  Examiners. I have also appointed Prof. Wilson as In- spector of the Juarez District of Churchschools, so that ENDENTRY promice to the effect, that the First Presidency authorize Apostle Brigham Young in writing to con- fer these degrees in the name of the General Board of Education next Thursday morning accor- ding to the already published program.  I think the would be the best way out of the dilemma for the  present occasion, as before another examination shall arrive, the General Board will have their question of degrees in our curch- schools settled definitely.

Dear Brother,  Having been set apart for my mission to California, at the Historian's Office, Friday, January 20th last, I started, accompanied by my daughter Ottilie, for my destination, Monday, January 23, and arrived at San Francisco, Wed- nesday, January 25. Elders Ezekiel L. Blo- gett recieved us at the landing with whom I shortly after proceeded to the Midwinter Fair Grounds to present my letter of introduction to Mr. Badlam, Secretary of the Executive Committee.

All the  Boards of Education in Arizona have been told by  me that there would be no prospect of an appropria- tion for next year and that, therefore, all their calcu- lations must be made with that point in view.  The schools in Mexico are in a satisfactory condition with the exception of Pacheco. In order to lift that school  out of its old rut, the local Board of Education has ap- plied to me for a Graduate from the Brigham Young  Academy. I have attended the exercises in each of them  for one whole day, except at Pacheco where one hour's  stay showed me the deplorable condition of that school.  I have instructed by special request of the Stake Presidency  all the teacher of our schools in Mexico, to pay special  attention to the Spanish language, to the Geography,  History, and Laws of Mexico, and to conduct their Arith- metic with particular reference to Mexican measures  and conditions.

Dear Brother;  The continuance of the financial depression as been very trying to our churchschools during the aca year 1894–1895. Some of the fifteen remaining students have had to struggle not only with the almost over whelming financial difficulties, but also with  unpardonable indifference of many member's on the Boards, thus throwing the whole burden of car rying on the school upon the shoulders of the teach ers, some of whom have grown quite discouraged on account of it.  Each one of our three colleges is now in a bad condition in regard to attendance as well as in professional work than ever before, so are the  Stake Academies at Preston. The  latter two are preparing for the highschool corses according to the instructions from the General  Board, and in due time, will apply for the proper charters. The Academies at C.

President Wilford Woodruff  Dear Brother,  After carefully considering the repres- endtations made by Dr. Talmage n the one hand, and by the Principals of our three Church Colleges on the other, I have come to the conclusion that the General Board of Education has to adopt a conservative medium bet= ween the two extremes.  Der. Talmage insists upon certain re- citations upon all church school for which demand he has no foundations The "Official Announcement" of Aug. 18, last refers only to the suspsension of the Church University and to the transfer of its intended work to the University of Utah, and making provisious for stu- dents of our faith to desire theological instructious in the L. D. S. College.  The people were exhorted also to support ENDENTRY commence our labors in representing to the people  the spirit and status of the Education among the Latterday Saints in Utah. To this end the leading institutions of our Church School Organisation had been communicated with and promises for cooperation had been obtained from the Provo, and from the James E. Talmage also contributed from his own private collection rare specimens of microsopic views. All these were to be augmented by a large con- signment of the principal publications of our Church by Geo. Q. Cannon and Sons.  For some unexplained reason much delay was experienced in obtaining our boxes from the East and our exhibit remained empty until Saturday, Febr. 24, when a portion of them were recieved, put up and made ready for opening the exhibit on Monday, Febr 26. It was a very incom- plete exhibit, as far as the educational part was concerned, for none of the things from the Brigham Young Academy had arrived yet. But the specimens in Drawing and Penman- ship from the Latterday Saint College, and Bro. Talmage's photographic views, with the Sunday School Charts helped me out considerably in that line, although compared with the other educa- tional exhibits of Santa Cruz County, St. Mary's College, Mills College, Deaf and Dumb Institute, and the  ENDENTRY Provo, Oct. 3rd, 1894.

The schools at Paris have had a  stagering existence during the past year, the for- mer on account of sickness which spoiled all  schools in the place for a season, and the latter on account of unsuitable locality. Even the new Stake Board of Star Valley is de- termined to have a churchschool at Afton next  quater if possible.  In order to carry through more thoroughly  the aims of our educational system, it will be  necessary, that the circular of the First Presi- dency of June 8, 1888, respecting the establishment of a Board of Education in every Stake of Zion  should be enforced more emphatically, so that  the provisions of the other circular of the First Presidency, dated Oct. 20, 1890, concerning the  ENDENTRY all those schools may receive more frequent official visits, their  teachers can meet and be instructed in methods of teaching, and  their labors be placed upon a more harmonious basis.

In an article on the sub- ject, explanatory to the "Official Au- nouncement; published by order of the General Board, under date of Sept. 18, last above my signature, our churchschools were instructed to consider themselves feeders to the State University. The reason for this is obvious: It is better to have our young people pursue their Univer- sity course at our home institution instead of going abroad for that purpose away from our control and influence.  All this refers enclusively to Univers- sity courses and their preparatory stages. In conformity with this understanding, our Stake Academies are now trying to arrange their curricula according to the prepared courses for highschools as near as possible.  There are, however, three Church Colleges, that are not mere Stake Academies, and have been authorized to conduct academic courses before our Church University ENDENTRY University of California, all adjoining ones on the same gallery, we stood as yet a poor show. The church- works made a fine display though, and were assisted in that by the grand picture of the First Presidency, the large picture of the Temple, representations in frame of the Utah Sugar Works, and a large album with the portraits of our Leaders All these furnished me abundant material for ex- planations and testimony. Notwithstanding the as yet incomplete representation of our education- al status, visitors commenced to increase daily in numbers and began to manifest greater intrest either pro or con as time went on. After several weeks of vexations delay the contribations from the Brigham Young Academy finally  arrived and lif- ted us at once upon our equal footing, educationally  speaking, with the other exhibits on the gallery. Foremost among the B. Y. A. specimens were the two  large cases of Carving Work, of the "Pocket Knife Class" as Professor Townshend, who has charge of that de- partment there, calls it.

Our people in many localities where they  constitute the majority may, therefore, get the opportunity  of securing teachers of our own faith for their public school.  By special invitation also I visited in company with  President Tempe. The President Dr. Mc Nadden introduced me to the students  whom I addressed for a short time by his request. He showed us all over the building.  The Academy at Thatcher is well prepared to open again  in the fall in regard to building and fixtures, as well as  to the intelligant way in which President Kimball and his  reorganized Stake Board of Education have taken the  matter in hand.

In addition to this, however, I should respectfully  suggest, that each Stake Board of Education should  be instructed to at once appoint a Stake Superin= tendent of Education, as their agent, this superinten= dent ought to receive one of our Licenses signed  by President Woodruff with the seal of the GBE attached,  to give more dignity to his office, and make him  sense more clearly his responsibility.  He could be  the one with whom I could communicate in  regard to the instructions of the First Presidency  and the General Board of Education and to the  Religion classes in his stake.  Karl G.

Snowflake, Arizona, in regard to his plan for young Latterday Saints to at- tend under certain regulations the Territorial University of Arizona at Tucson, his correspondence with President Howard Billman of that institution, and the ac- companying letters of endorsement from Presidents Jesse W. Smith, have been carefully considered by me.  There are two sides to the proposition of Bro. Frost which present themselves to me under following aspects:  1. While the attendance of Mormonstudents in a corporate capacity at the University of Arizona would, on the one hand, have a tendency to demonstrate to the citizens of that territory the loyality of the Saints for their home institutions, it would, on the other, be of financial advantage to the students themselves, in as much as the traveling expences in most cases could be reduced considerably.  2. I agree fully with the objection of President Jesse W. Smith, that the hot climate of Tucson is  ENDENTRY had been established, and were not re- stricted in their labors after the opening of the Church University.  The "Official Announcement" nor its explanatory sup- plement of Sept. 18, could have, therefore, no application to our Church Colleges; and aAny restrictions in regard to them as prepared by Dr. Talmage are not justified by any documentary evidence, and ^They^ would deter our Church School Organization from developing that system of education which the Spirit of God has prompted the First Presidency to inaugurate in Zion.  On the other hand these three Prin- cipals of our Church Colleges have been conducting collegiate courses, parallel or of equal grade to some of those at the State University, and are asking for the privilege of organising came more. As far as these colleges have duly au- thorized professors to conduct such ENDENTRY by beginners in that line of work, and the comments, on it is not frequent and in a high terms. Specimens of Normal physical diagrams, penmanship, and drawings made up the balance. Our exhibit being thus complete, as short time of notice, limited preparations and circumstan- ces could possibly make it, a large sign in front of our booth with the legend "Latterday Saints' Educational Exhibit", gave notice to all visitors who we were. A book of visitors was opened, into which many, about 1200, have inscribed their names.  There are names from Italy, Scandinavia, England, the United States, and Sandwich Islands, names of many creeds, and of all classes of society in it. With very few exceptions, each one of them had heard my testimony, and a great many more, that did not write their names. Our exhibit was opened daily at 9 AM and closed at 5 P.M. as all other educational exhibits did. We did not open on Sundays, as Cummings, who should alternate with me Sundays, was called home, and I had none else competent to be trusted with that work and my labors cannot  be indispensable at our Sunday meetings and Sunday schools. ENDENTRY is negotiating for the lease of a very suitable building under  exceedingly favorable terms at Snowflake  Stake Board of Education has succeeded in collecting already  the greater part of six Thousand Dollars for their  new bAcademy building, for which I have drawn their  plan.  By correspondence during the last three months from  the Brigham Young College,  Ephraim,  Vernal, and  Huntington Seminary, I learn that  that they are in a more prosperous condition than ever  before with the exception of the one at Cedar City, which  is placed at disadvantage by the establishment of the  State Normal Branch School there.  The Academies at Logan, Vernal, Paris, and  Ephraim, have either completed or are engaged in com- pleting their new or additions to the old buildings, while  Emery Stake Board of Education continues dilatory in  finishing their Academy building commenced several  years ago.  Conventions.  In conformity with the devision of the General Board  of Education I have divided our churchschools into  several districts, each to be provided over by one of the  Presidents of the three Colleges, as Inspector. These Inspectors ENDENTRY illy adapted for a university. Besides this arises another serious objection and that is, that the environments of that pronounced catholic town with its large Mexican population do not offer sufficient guaren- tee against questionable influences upon our young people that should go there.  It is a well known fact, that this last mentioned point in regard to questionable influences does not constitute a strong factor of consideration in the management of American High Schools.  It is a mere question of time when it shall become imperative upon the General Board of Education to create one of our Stake Academies in Arizona into a High School for preparatory courses to one of our own colleges. Such a step would ob- viate the necessity for our young people to go to Tucson in as much as that institution is neither now nor ^will be^ for a long time to come illegible our regular High School grade.  Your brother in the Gospel Karl G. Maeser ENDENTRY classes, the General Board ought to grant their request in conformity with Gen. Circ. No. 8, pages 4 and 5, para 3.  These three Principals petition further for the right of conveying degrees with corresponding diplomas, as results of examinations held by themselves, This right has been reserved there for to the General Board, with the exception of the Provo, who, as it appears, has acted arbitrarily in this matter, once or twice, and should be prohibited from repeating this irregularity.  The diplomas issued from that institution thus far, ought not to be recognised by the General Board.  But as there are many students desiring to finish their academic courses in these colleges, where they have commenced them, provided that institution is duly chartered to conduct such courses, it would be well to uncourage these institutions by issuing charters to that effect, but with such catre as the im- portance of the case required.

As this is pre- visely the same case as we had under considera- tion in regard to Prof. B. Y. Academy, Provo, plan, and for which I asked your consent in my letter of May 20, I suggest that you author- ize me, as it was above at Provo, to bestow these degrees to the Graduates at Logan, "in the name of the General Board of Education".  This ought to be done with the understanding that this action should establish no precedent binding the General Board of Education in formulating a final decision regarding this matter ENDENTRY G. B. E.  have been instructed to make periodical visits to  the schools under their charge, attend the Commense- ment exercises, and examinations of Graduates, and  make their reports to me. By this means our educational  system is making a very great step in advance. I respect- fully suggest, that I be authorized to call district con- ventions for the respective school districts at Poca- tello, Provo, sometime during the  summervacation, at which occasions the examina- tions for churchshoolteachers, whose licenses have  expired, could be held also.  All our Church school Boards have been instructed  by me according to the decision of the General Board to  have ^keep^ their financial records in shape so that I can  examine them at my periodical visits.  Religion Classes.  Religion Classes are now in running order in  Box Elder,  Wayne,  San Luis Stakes of Zion, while St. George, and  ENDENTRY such diplomas and certificates who should apply for any position in our Church School Organization should re- port to the Church Board of Examiners for examination in Theology and give such ^additional^ evidences of their qualification as that Board may deem advisable in order to obtain a corresponding Diploma or Certificate from the General Board.  In this connection it is my duty to report that in the opinion of the ma- jority of the members of the Board of Examiners the position of Dr. Talmage as a member of the Board of Examiners is not conducive to the best interests of our churchschools.  They think that it would be but natural for the President of the University to discount the efficien- cy of Church School Examinands in favor of Graduates from the University.  Dr. Karl G. Maeser Gen. Supt. ENDENTRY the upperhand here; made the most of it. Our meeting place, 927 Mission Str, was in an undigni- fied locality, with crowds of loafing and smok- ing Socialist to holding their meetings on the ground- floor at the same time, and crowding at the entrance, thus forcing ladies wanting to come to our meetings, to push their way through the best they could. The Saints saw discouraged through having to carry ^in part^ the family of the President, for  which the small Branch was not prepared. To the credit of Bro. Dalton it must be stated, however, that he has labored hard and unceasing- ly to work up this mission. His misfortune was that he had a family on his hands, when he should have been free from such anxieties, and that he had called for more missionaries then there was work for them, and finally that neither he nor his missionaries, with the exception of Bro. Williams, were exactly the kind of men needed in this peculiar field of labor. Of great assistance to us were our visitors to the Midwinter Fair from Zion who rendered us financial help by their liberal contributions. But above all the visits of Apostles Lyman, and of Elders ^Roberts have been of great benefit to us. ENDENTRY I have written Prof. Kesr, that with your per- mission I should bestow these degrees "in the name of the General Board of Education" and, as he has invited me, to deliver the Bacealar- cate address on that occasion.  I have no blanks anymore for statistical reports for all our churchschools.  The prin- cipals are clamaring for it. It is necessary that some should be printed to help me and of the difficulty.

Provo, February 6, 1896.  President Wilford Woodruff, Dear Brother:  Since my last report the prospects  of our church schools have brightened in many respects, so that the  resumption of several ^church^ schools, that have been temporarily suspended, can be looked for with much confidence in the next academic year.  As already stated in my former report, my visits to the various  church schools, with the exception of the three colleges, had to be  confined to opportunities afforded me at my Sunday School appointments. This difficulty I have endeavored to partially overcome by an extensive  and to some degree exhaustive correspondence and by the monthly Church  School Papers in the Juvenile Instructor.  The Stake Academies at Paris, Idaho are re- ported in a very flourishing condition, but are urgently requesting my  personal visit before April conference.  I have not seen them for two  years past; and at several points in their organization and methods  are reported as neading my personal attention.  The Ogden has recently taken quite a start up- wards, but Pres. Shurtliff and the Stake Board feel reluctant to assume  the responsibility of starting the High School course, and will not  apply for such a charter at present.  The Stake Academies at Ephraim have made their mark in the  educational affairs of their respective localities and are looked upon  by the people as leaders in this respect.  The Brigham Young Academy at Provo has reached the highest actual  attendance she ever had, and is also in spiritual matters conforming  closer to the main object of our educational system than of late years. ENDENTRY and San Juan Stakes, are urging me to come and start them in their localities at my earliest convenience.  This work is rapidly assuming proportions that could not have been foreseen at the time of its small  beginning and soon more workers in its general  management maybe needed.  Karl G. Maeser Gen. Supt. ENDENTRY Our Sundayschool has been reorganised and brought into greater conformity with the pl instructions given by the S. S. Union Board and General Super- intendancy. My efforts in organising a Relief Society here, have thus far not been successful, but we are conducting now a testimony meeting every Thursday evening, which is also attended by strangers. The removal of our meetings to our new gnatcters to the "California Mission Chapel" 29 Eleventh Str, has been a great step in advances, and our mee- tings are well attended now by strangers, and in- quiring friends. A Choir has been organised, taught  and conducted until last week by Ot- tilie. Since her return home, I have had to take charge of it myself the best way I could in singing and playing the organ, being assisted in this work by Bro. Ogden, who is attending here the Medical College. As the rent for this little chapel is $30.00 per month and nearly $5.00 more for the rest of the organs- gas, and water, but Bro. Mortenson is paying $10.00 out of it for seat of the basementrooms, there are still $25.00 to be raised monthly. $15.00 have ENDENTRY Although there are yet two points in that I  cannot reconcile myself. The first is the promiscuous use of the title  "Professor" on official publications of that institution by various  instructors, that are not authorized by the General Board of Education  to use that title officially, according to Gen. Circ. No. 8, page 6. The second is, the use of so called "Academy yells", notwithstanding my  repeated remonstrances, and the public censure of Apostle Brigham Young, President of the Academy Board.  The Logan, under the judicious management of Prof. Kerr is giving great satisfaction in every respect. It is to  be hoped that any remarks to the faculty and private conversation with  Bro. Kerr in regard to emphasizing the Apirit of the Latter-day Work  somewhat more, will be followed up in future. I object to the use of  "Christian Evidences" as textbooks during the finishing course in  Theology. We have publications of our own which cover that ground far  more satisfactorily.  The Latter-day Saints College has been filled to, overflowing this  year, and needs more room for the next academic year, or the institution  will have to retrogade, which would be a calamity, and reflect disad- vantageously upon this stake of Zion.  The Maricopa had to be carried on this year on the  "makeshift" principle.  The Superintendents of the Y. M. M. I. A.  volunteering to conduct the school as best he can for the time being. During my next visit there, it is to be hoped, better arrangements for  the future will be effected.  The Thatcher is rapidly assuming influential  proportions, and promises to become in the near future the centre of our  educational system in Arizona.  The Mexico has been place at a great disadvant- ENDENTRY been subscribed for thus far as monthly con- tributions by members of this Branch, one half of whom are women, either widows or married to outsiders. This will be a serious question to be solved, as thus far the assistance rendered ^us^ so matterrally runderus by visiters to the Mid- winter Fair and $9.00 Tithing monthly from Sister Caine will cease. As there are several parties investigating the Gospel and some are ready for baptism, some hope is entertained that an increase of contributions can be looked for at an early day. The work has now begun, and many that have drifted into the Josephite Church are beginning to reflect and discover that they are on the wrong side of the fence. Much now depends how this Awa- king is kept up, and that the Lord by His Holy Spirit may bless and assist the labors of His servants in this mission in the future to the salvation of many souls, is the prayers of  Your brother in the Gospel, Karl G. Maeser ENDENTRY age this year through the retirement of Bro. Dennis Harris from the  educational field, the faithful principal for several years. The  appointment of Bro. Webb, of Snowflake, as his successor fell through  by the miscarriage of letters, and Sister Romney has taken temporary  charge of the institution.  I am now engaged in assisting the respective Boards of Education  in resuming operations for the next academic year in the Stake Academies, at Beaver, and Snowflake.  The Board of Examiners has held two sessions since my last report, and is now engaged in examining a number of church school instructors for  certificates of the Intermediate Grade, and some for diplomas. The  results of these exam^i^nations will be reported to the General Board in  due time with the recommendations required in each case.  The Presidents of our three colleges have also been appointed by  the Board of Examiners to submit the course of studies for all those  branches for which they have been authorized by the General Board to  issue diplomas and to confer degrees. Also to submit a suggestive  High School plan for those Stake Academies that have been notified by  the General Board to apply for a High School Charter, if they choose to.  The subject of a Church School convention to be held some time during the summer vacation has been discussed at great length at the last  meeting of the Board of Examiners, and a notice to that effect has been  inserted in the February number of the Church School Papers, requesting  our fellow laborers in the Church School organization to give us the  benefit of their ideas on the subject.  The religion classes have assumed a more definite form of late in  Tooele Stakes, by a method of primary teach- ing exhibited by me in several places. A lecture on this subject was  ENDENTRY P.S.  After the departure of Bro. Cummings for home, the Branch at Keller whose personal acquaintance I made several weeks later. Bro. Keller being entirely inexperienced in writing, it was with much difficult- ty that I could gather some informal news about the condition of the Saints there the moreso as it was impossible for me under the circumstances to pay them a visit. It appears, however, that the little life existing in that Branch went gradually down as soon Bro. Cummings had left, and Bro. Keller utterly discouraged, hence my request for his return. Two efficient elders may be able under divine guidance to revive the work.  Bros. San Bernar- dino and vicinity, reported to me regularly their labors. From their letters it became apparent however, that the Josephites were facing things their own way in Southern California, and that these young missionaries were simply walked over. This opinion was shared by Elders Roberts during their visit in San Bernardino, San Diego. Both young brothers, therefore, by your instruction, were transferred ENDENTRY recently given by me in the 14th Ward meeting house, which seemed to have  met the approval of several of my leading co-laborers present on the  occasion.  The growing pressure of outside influences upon our youth is a  constant source of much anxiety to me. To counteract this evil still  more with my feeble efforts, I have yielded to the solitations of  former students and of present co-laborers of mine, to consolidate all  my educational views into one book, and thus place myself on record  before the people in regard to my views on the educational effordts of  our people, their history, their final aims, and their methods. This  work is about being completed. Before publishing it, however, I would  respectfully beg the General Board to appoint a committee of at least  three, to whom I could submit the manuscript for any corrections, alterations, or amendments they should desire to be made.  I remain, with kind regards,  Your Brother in the Gospel, Karl G. Maeser, Gen. Supt.

ENDENTRY The Gire' property reported and a visit to Dr. Schumacher U. S.  Vice Consul to Haifa.  President Wilford Woodruff and Counsellors,  Dear Brethren, Since  reporting to you last I have moved to Haifa. On my  way I formed the aquaintance of a Mr. J Tueni, of the  Turkish Legation at St. Petersbourg. He told me that his cousin Mr. George Tueni and Co were the agents and coowners with  himself in the Great Sursuk estate. As the steamer  stayed at Beyrout one whole day I landed also to see  to such business as we had in that city. I wvisited the  U. S. Consulate. The officials seemed pleased to see me and  offered their servises in our behalf when needed. At  Beyrout I also called on the Printer, Mr. Khalil Sarkis. He  seemed very anxious for our work and told me he had  counted the type on us as our property in his first esti- mate. I did not so understand it. But when he heard  I had been to Stamboul and was more familiar with prices  he seemed anxious not to loose the job.  Next, I called on Mr. Tueni and Co. They offered us the  Gire' property, with good titlle about 25,000 dollars less  than Selim Khory. They own 2/3 of the property and Mr Khory  only 1/3. If the property is wanted it can be had much chea- per I think. At the office of Mr. Tueni and Co, a Jew Mr. Osso- vetsky was introduced to me. He offered me land near  Mt Tabor. This I expect also to visit. He holds a good titlle  and claims good climate and good land and water for his land.  Mr. Tueni gave me a letter of introduction to one ENDENTRY Mr Farezli their Agent at Haifa. With him I visited  Gire'. I found the country looking very dry. This was  to be expected it is the dry season of the year. It does not  resemble the green rich looking hills we saw in  April. The country looks white with lime stones and  boulders strewn over a great deal of the hills. These were  covered with grain, grass and weeds when we saw it in  the spring, but now the whole country is cleared off  by man, beasts and the heat. The low lands on the Kishon  were also naked and the land hard as a brick. The  whole nature is slumbering in the heat patiently await- ing the early rains which are due now in a week or two.  Clouds have already been threatning rain for some  days. When the early rains arrive every thing partakes of new  life and the farmers will prepare for the next season’s crops.  I found water in Sseveral plasces. The spring by the  villige good though small. There was water enough  for house use and cattle but not for irrigation. The  Kishon is completely dry from Hartich and up. That is 3 or 4  miles west of Gire-Kamon. The Manager of Gire-Ka- mon and the fellahs generally claimed they were all well  and free from Malaria. They all looked well. It is my im pression that there is not much Malaria and Sickness. the  fellahs or more troubled with eye diseases. The heat is  not so opressive though it ranges often between 80 and 100  degrees in the shade. With all the Arabs carry their Winter cloak ENDENTRY and wrap their stomachs and heads heavily. ^(A cool breeze is continually blowing from the sea.)^ I obtained  a few samples of Grain, which I will forward for your  inspection. Mr. Farezli took me to the Delieh and Roha,  two villages on the top of the hills toward Samaria,  hence nearly south of Gire'. I did not go over all  the property, but it look^ed^ like a more gentle rolling hill  country. The water suply rather better than the Gire'.  But owning to presence of more water they have also more  sickness. The fellahs claimed the streams were alowed to  spread in the Valleys below and that the Malaria had its origin  there. As soon as the Water was confined to its proper chan- nals then it would relieve them of Malaria. As the they are  several miles from the Crocodile river and bottoms it seems  impossible that they should suffer from that scourse. They  are, however, on the head waters of that Malarious stream.  The soil of either or all of these properties does not  look very rich. It appeared much better in the wet season.  The cattle look fair in flesh. Their cattle is of a very small breed.  The trees and vegatation in and around Haifa  looks much better than I had expected considering  the long summer heat and no water. Fig trees, Olive trees,  Pomegranites and some Apple trees. Allso every greens and orna mental trees of various kinds, are all looking green and  well. They await the rain, and cold weather to follow, to strip  them of their foliage. It is wonderful how nature is provided  here whereby vegitation can sustain life without Water.  ENDENTRY Visit to Dr G. Schumacher U. S. Vice Consul.  Last week I called on Dr. Schumacher U. S. Vice Consul  to Haifa. He is at least a real Gentleman. He at onece  warned me against the whole Sursuk property and  against the Gire' in particular. He said the whole proper ty was in question and that only part of the Gire' property  was secure, the Government claimed the medows. Sursuk  by the agressive policy permitted here, had by degrees crow- ded the beduins off by buying a part of the land from the  Government. Had it been safe the Germans as well as the  Jews had long sinse bought it. He also spoke of the land  as being inferior in grade and the country generally un- healthy. He said the Germans had been thankful several  times that they did not buy it. They had tryed the  Kishon country and had lost many lives. To prove that the  property was in dispute he said that one of Mr. Khori's sons  desired to be his first dragoman but the Government ob- jected to his appointment on the grounds of the law suit.  I have no reasons to mistrust the Consul but I will  take steps to assertain more about it in time. Should it,  however, prove true, it would, of course, stop all negotiations  for the present relating to that property. But they do not own  the whole of Palestine, their is still a nicke chunk left of Syria.  In speaking of our intentions of settling Palestine  Dr. Schumacher said that he and the colonies would be  only too glad to assist us in our interprise, this had  been their aim and mission and that they would gladly as- ENDENTRY sist in any move which looked toward the ful- fillment of the promises to the hHouse of Israel.  He refered to the mistakes they had made in not  buying more land in the Hauran and in land. They  had spendt their strength here on the coast where there  was no room for expansion. He said if ^we^ wished they  would sell us land here for building a coast or  trading post, a place for the reception of emigrants  and for imports and exports. And that we might be co-buyers  with them in property at Tabor where they were contem plating to make a purchase for a midway villige to the  Hauran. He advised to settle the Hauran, it is now being opened up. The Jews have already three settlements.  The land is cheap. Good land for 6 francs pr acre, all fees  included. Elavation from 1500 to 3000 feet above the level  of the sea with a fine climate and good water and plenty  of it. It is generally a flat plateau country except the  Jebel ed druid Mount Lebanon, the mountain where the druses live.  Dr. Shumacher spoke of the Druse trouble as some  thing of the past, that the Government had the control, and that the great plains of the Hauran are perfectly  safe. The Consul ought to be good authority. He has  Surveyed the whole country for the Government for  the Palestine Exprloration Fund, and English society.  His works are published and I will try to procure copies  of these valuable books for your perusal and ENDENTRY send them to you. He appeared very anxious to  have us engage with them in obtaining land. He  offered to take a trip with me to the Hauran after  the Kaiser's visit. I would like to aquaint my self with  that country personally, and if I hear nothing to the  contrary I shall probably make the trip sometime this  fall if I can arrange my business there with. Now  that the Girè property is in doubt and no special  objective point for a settlement ^being^ in view I am left in  doubt as to what course to pursue until I hear from  you. In reading our letter of instructions it appears  to me that we have are yet far from being thoroughly  familiar with every portion of the land that would  be likely to furnish a suitable place for gathering." We  have followed largely the popular routes, but the out of the way places which offer better oppertumities for development  by improving the roads and transportation facilities we do not  nknow anything about. The Consul smiled at the idea  of the Government refusing to allow roads to be built. He  said that was chiefly against the Jews in order to hinder  their advancement and to squeeze money out of them. Yet I  know personally that the Government often prevents the natives  from building roads. I supose there are difficulties but I believe  they can be overcome by patience and the help of the Lord.  Respecting titles, he said that we could safely buy and  receive good titles without much trouble. We had to be care ENDENTRY ful to see that our titles were properly issued at first  and the limits well defined. Then if any local officer  would object to the transfer the Consul would fix the rest  by ordering the transfer through the Vali. We have better  treaty rights than other nations said Dr. Schumacher and  we have no trouble in maintaining them. He said  Their worst trouble was with the U. S. Minister in  Constantinople. For many years no there was no question  of their pass ports. But Minister Terril, a former  Minister had raised a point that America had no  colonization policy and that those who intended to re side permanently abroad would not be protected. They  had only saved themselves by stating that they were here in the Spiritual interest of the people. Should this be  found an objection to us we could probably have that ar- ranged by our representatives in Congress.  The reception I have received from Vice Consul Schu macher has been a surprise to me. I hope it will take  no unfavorable reaction. I hope it is based on some un derstanding between him and the leading Elders of the Colo ny; as he has made several unreserved propositions to  cooperate with us. I believe the colonists have done  fairly well this year. Brother Gran grow and Brother ^Hilt^ say they have  done well in wine. I claim continually that this Temple  society with all their oddities and old country, old fashioned  way have proved beyound a doubt the possibility of inha- ENDENTRY biting and living fairly well in Palestine. How much  better cannot we do it who are farmore advanced in the  method of agriculture and progress in general and less wrapt in old superstions and traditional ways.  At present I would not advise any Elder sent here ^to labor among the Germans.^  I think that when we commence to gather here the Lord  will move upon the people to receive the Gospel. The old fellows  will not listen to the Gospel, they have partially rejected it, but the  coming generation is different, and if we raise no opposition at  present by trying to convert their children to a faith which they  fancy is the worst of all, Then it seems to me we can probab ly work in harmony with them and when we are established  in the land the Lord’s are bound to come to Him as they  are as a comunity decaying and ^the aged^ old dying off gradually. We  will preach more effectually with our works, and I believe  we have much to gain among these honest, wellmeaning people.  Hoping you may be able to find some good in  my feeble efforts and something worthy of your consi- deration in my reports from time to time, and further  that you will instruct me how to proceed I remain  as ever your humble fellowlaborenr in the everla- sting covenant.

Protocol concluded August 11, 1874 (Right of Foreigners to hold real estate in the Ottoman Empire).  1600.  PROTOCOL.  The law granting foreigners the right of holding real estate does  not interfere with the immunities specified by the treaties, and which  will continue to protect the person and the movable property of  foreigners who may become owners of real estate.  As the exercise of the right of possessing real property  may induce foreigners to establish themselves in larger numbers  in the Ottoman Empire, the Imperial Government thinks it proper  to anticipate and to prevent the difficulties to which the appli- cation of this law may give rise in certain localities.  Such is  the object of the arrangements which follow.  The domicile of any person residing upon the Ottoman soil  being inviolable, and as no one can enter it without the consent  of the owner, except by virtue of orders emanating from the compe- tent authority and with the assistance of the magistrate or fun- ctionary invested with the necessary powers, the residence of foreign- ers is inviolable on the same principle, in conformity with the  treaties, and the agents of the public force cannot enter it with- out the assistance of the Consul or of the delegate of the Consul  of the power on which the foreigner depends.  By residence we understand the house of inhabitation and its  dependencies: that is to say, the out-houses, courts, gardens, and  neighboring inclosures, to the exclusion of all other parts of the  property.  In the localities distant by less than nine hours' journey  from the Consular residence, the agents of the public force cannot  enter the residence of a foreigner without the assistance of a Con- sul, as was before said.  On his part the Consul is bound to give his immediate assistance  to the local authority, so as not to let six hours elapse between  the moment which he may be informed and the moment of his departure,  or the departure of his delegate, so that the action of the author- ities may never be suspended more than twenty-four hours.  In the localities distant by nine hours or more than nine  hours of travel from the residence of the Consular Agent, the agents  of the public force may, on the request of the local  authority,  and with the assistance of three members of the Council of the El- ders of the Commune, enter into the residence of a foreigner, with- out being assisted by the Consular Agent, but only in case of urgency,  and for the search and the proof of the crime of murder, of attempt  at murder, of incendiarism, of armed robbery either with infraction  or by night in an inhabited house, of armed rebellion, and of the  fabrication of counterfeit money, and this entry may be made whether  the crime was committed by a foreigner or by an Ottoman subject,  ENDENTRY and whether it took place in the residence of a foreigner or not in  his residence, or in any other place.  These Regulations are not applicable but to the parts of the  real estate which constitute the residence, as it has been heretofore  defined.  Beyond the residence, the action of the police shall be exercised  freely and without reserve; but in case a person charged with crime  or offense should be arrested, and the accused shall be a foreigner,  the immunities attached to his person shall be observed in respect  to him.  The functionary or the officer charged with the accomplishment  of a domiciliary visit, in the exceptional circumstances determined before, and the members of the Council of Elders who shall ass^i^st him, will be obliged to make out a procès-verbal of the domiciliary visit, and to communicate it immediately to the superior authority under  whose jurisdiction they are, and the latter shall transmit it to the  nearest Consular Agent without delay.  A special regulation will be promulgated by the Sublime Porte  to determine the mode of action of the local police in the several  cases provided heretofore.  In localities more distant than nine hours' travel from the  residence ofthe Consular Agent, in which the law of the judicial organ- ization of the Velayet may be in force, foreigners shall be tried,  without the assistance of the Consular Delegate, by the Council of  Elders, fulfilling the function of justices of the peace, and by the  tribunal of the canton, as well for actions not exceeding one thousand  piasters as for offenses entailing a fine of five hundred piasters  only at the maximum.  Foreigners shall have, in any case, the right of appeal to the  tribunal of the arrondissement against the judgments issued, as above  stated, and the appeal shall be followed and judged with the assist- ance of the Consul, in conformity with the treaties.  The appeal shall always suspend the execution of a sentence.  In all cases the forcible execution of the judgments, issued on the conditions determined heretofore shall not take place without  the co-operation of the Consul or of his Delegate.  The Imperial Government will enact a law which shall determine  the rules of procedure to be observed by the parties in the applica- tion of the preceding regulations.  Foreigners, in whatever locality they may be, may freely submit  themselves to the jurisdiction of the Council of Elders or of the  tribunal of the canton without the assistance of the Consul in cases  which do not exceed the competency of these councils or tribunals, res reserving always the right of appeal before the tribunal of the  arrondissement, where the case may be brought and tried with the  assistance of the Consul or the Delegate.  The consent of a foreigner to be tried, as above stated, without  the assistance of his Consul, shall always be given in writing and in  advance of all procedure. ENDENTRY It is well understood that all these restrictions do not con- cern cases which have for their object questions of real estate,  which shall be tried and determined under the conditions estab- lished by the law.  The right of defense and the publicity of the hearings shall  be assured in all cases to foreigners who may appear before the  Ottoman tribunals, as well as to Ottoman subjects.  The preceding dispositions shall remain in force until the  revision of the ancient treaties, a revision which the Sublime  Porte reserves to itself the right to bring about hereafter by an  understanding between it and the friendly powers.  If I under^stood^ General Dickensen right—  all questions of title to real estate  are handled by our Legation in  behalf of United States Citizens.  F. F. H. ENDENTRY Financial Report.

From Apostle I  learn that the printing of some tracts have  been considered and that the probable cost would be $400. 00/100  I beg leave to report that Bro. Binyad has  called the President of the Censor Board and is  informed that for about $250. 00/100, (not to exceed this amount) we can get a general or full permission  to print any and all of our works, subject, of course,  to the sensor counscil the same as all others.  But  when the Permission is given by the Minister  of Public instruction and those whose business it is  to sign; Then we are recognized as publishers and  can open our own printing press etc.  We can  also publish our pamplets and books here much  cheaper so that I think that there is no question  but that we will be able to get the Permission and  also print all four tracts suggested for the  $40000 here in Constantinople.  I should recom mend this course. No money until permission  is ready for signature and complete.  This much  alone would be a great help. That one branch  of the Government assists the other in recog nizing us.  Printing permits also shows the  officers in the Country that we are recognized. I am informed that the recognition by the  ENDENTRY government does in no case include the  printing privilidge which is independantly  controled by the Minister of Public instruc- tions and the Censor Councill. We will there fore need this permit in all cases and will  have to make the petition seperately.  Brother Binyad has experience in these  matters as he had a permission nearly ready  for us once but when the Elders here could  not furnish the money the Seventh-day Ad- vents got it and now have it although they  are not recognized. The President of the Censor board  was not pleased with it as he would rather  we should have had it as the Advents have  been offensive in their publcations for  which several were arrested. Bro. Binyad had a  couple of days of it before he could prove he  was no Advent. This because his name had  been connected with the permit.  Please give me your instructions in re gard to this matter at your earliest con vinience so that I may proceed accordingly  Respectfully F. F. Hintze ENDENTRY Investigation of  correspondence be- tween the U.S. Legation and the  Porte  President Woodruff and Counsellors. Dear Brethern,  I called at the Legation to investigate the assertion  of U.S. Marshall Allaimby. That the Legation of the U.S. had of- fered its good office to help supress Mormonism.  I found  the Marshall was correct.  It appears that in Oct 1887, the  Turkish Government had been stuffed about us opening a prin ting press and that the editor Mr. Hintze lived at Kom Kapoo, and that they wished the legation to supress it.  Oct 30, 1887  Someone whose name is not attached, came near forgetting  the complaint in his attempt to blackmail Mormonism.  He tells  the Porte that Mormism was a Statuary crime in America and  a disgrace upon civilization, and that they would do all in their  power to help supress Mormonism and to prevents its spread in  Turkey.  It is an interesting peice of deplomacy, cheifly because  of its cowardly attack.  The writer wanted to stigmatize polyga- my but did not dare to mention it where^fore^ he beats around the  corner with interesting eloquence.  On Nov 30. the Consuls writes that he has been notified that the government had re- peeded its complaints, telling the Consul that they did not complain  of the subject matter, it was only the unlawful printing  without permission they opposed.  Consul General Mr. Pringle  then tells the Legation that he had seen Mr. Hintze and that it was  was all settled by Mr. Hintze delivering up the tracts. (The tracts in question were a few german tracts published by Elders  Tanner and myself.  The publisher assured us it was allright  and that no one would question it. But an Armenian betrayed us) With this explanation the affair was settled.  About that time  I had had a number of visits with different high of- ENDENTRY ficials and they were somewhat informed on  Mormonism. And Mr. Allaimby is authority for the  statement, that the Porte snubed ^the^ Minister by telling  him that the Mormons would be protected as others and had the same right: The Turks saw the sceme and they  were too smart to be caught. I could not get a copy. When  Mr Riddle saw the nature of it, it made him a little nervous  and he said with a smile: "Well, I guess that is all burried,  is it not? I, of course repyed it was. I saw he was ashamed  of it so I did not press it. And although we can ge it through  the State deparment at Washington, I think it best to leave it  til later on. It ^will^ makes a little history someday. It is very  encouraging right now to know that the Porte has  taken our part even when attacked by our own. Representation. Upon solicitation I explained our faith to Mr. Riddle. He  listened with attention and interest. Also Consul General  Dickensen gave me a lengthy audience.  Marshall Allaimby loves to speak of his stay in Utah. He speaks in high terms of our people. He remembers Presidents Woodruff, Park and others. He has offered me his servises several times. He also  refers to Mr. Strauss, the coming Minister, as a liberal minded and fair and just man. Mr. Strauss is a Hebrew  and as such may do us much good. The reply itself from  the Porte I did not see, but Con. Gen. Pringles letter I  saw and it bears out the claim of Mr. Allaimby.  Respectfully F. F. Hintze. ENDENTRY ^6 Febr. 1890^  President Wilford Woodruff and Councillors, Salt Lake City, Utah.  Dear Brethern.  In compliance with your request I cheer- fully place on paper my report of the Turkish mis- sion, and hope I may be able to so write as to  give you a proper and comprehensive understand- ing of the work of the Lord in that part of His vineyard.  I left Turkey on  the first day of Nov. 1886 and arrived in Constanti ple on the 16th of Jan. 1887 remaining about 6 weeks in  England in order to obtain a passport. Shortly af- ter arriving at Constantinople I was appointed  by Prest. J. M. Tanner to the  Armenian quarter of Stanboul there to live and  study the Turkish language and to become better  aquainted with ^the^ natives and their customs.  I at once began studying the Turkish langu- age which I was quite successful in acquiring  for the purposes required. We, however, found  but little response among the people in Constan tinople, but it soon became evident that  we could do some work in the interior  of Asia Minor, wherefore, I recommended 2 more  Elders to come to my assistance. Shortly after,  about Nov. 1887, Elder James Clove arrived, who  after staying about 2 year became sick and was  ENDENTRY released to return home. In the winter between  1887 and 1888, at the reuquest of Brother I went  to Hungaria to baptize his parents. His brother and  sister-in-law, but as they needed some more  information I waited a couple of days during  which time I and Brother Markow testified to  many in the villige of Serb Czernia, Hungaria. But on the third day I was called before  the preist, a Greek orthodox, and then sent to  the magistrate by whom I was ordered to  leave the country forthwith. I failled  in my attempt to open ^up^ the gospel in that  land at that time, but I firmly believe that  good will yet be realized from my labors there.  I there ordained Brother Markow and Elder and  appointed him to labor as best he could and thus  intdirectly my labors resuleted in the Gospel being ope- ned up in Antwer- ben you are, I beleive, fully advised. Brother Markow  has since been been requested to come to Hungaria to  baptize his parents. In the latter part of Aug. 1888 I  left Asia Minor  with a veiw to see the people and what the prospects  were for opening up the door of life there, and also  to visit the saints in Palestine. In the spring of  1889 in company with Elder J. M. Sjödahl I visited  the Holy land, Palestine, and in the summer the  ENDENTRY same year Constantinople preach ing by the way. I baptized 6 persons on this trip,  I3 of which were local preachers and one a young  teacher.  I baptized was released in Dec. to return home by President George Teasdale having been  in Turkey 3 years within a few days. Altogether I  injoyed my mission very much and felt I was  very much blessed of the Lord and feel sure that  our united labors in that field will yet result in  much good.  Several elders have been sent to labor in  Turkey since I arrived, but according to the best  of my knowledge most of them are either released  or soon will be, some because of sickness others  because of lack of means and, perhaps, but little  faith in that mission. There has been about 30  baptisms in that mission and we have many warm  freinds.  The difficulties in establishing the Gospel in Turkey  are many. In order to preach the Gospel success- fully there we should be recognized by the Govern ment. We have petitioned for recognition but have  obtained none cheifly because no means were  at our command to pay our way.  Printing could not be done to any appriciable  extent because we were not recognized.  While wvisiting Palestine I became convinced  ENDENTRY that in order to successfully preach the Gospel in  the orient and to do those people any marked good  that it would be nessesary to colonize there. Some  of my reasons for this wevirew are these. The Turkish  ^mission^ is so far from our mountain home in Utah that  the expences to thouroughly prosecute a long and  successful mission are very heavy, hence Elders are  few who can meet that demand, and the expences toge- ther with the strange customs and habits of the  natives tend to discourage the brethern. Then  it is far for the poor saints to emigrate, and they  are but poorly prepared to come to Zion as they are  but not at all acquainted with our customs  and mode of living. Again, it is prohibited by law  to emigrate from Turkey; and that to-gether with  the jealousy of our own nation would be against  oriental emigration to Zion. But on the other hand  could we obtain a home in that ancient land of  promise, we could there educate the saints to our  ways and prepare them to receive both temporal  and spiritual progress. The saints there are  fully imbued with the spirit of gathering,  wherefore they are anxiously looking forward  to the day they may be priveleged to gather with  the saints to Zion. That land is also the destiny of the  Jews, and inasmuch as we are destined to do a great  work ffor them, we will be there prepared to do them ENDENTRY good and to assist them in every way at our command.  Palestine as a land to  sustain life are very good, and though but little  can be said of the signs of the fruitfulness of the land returning, yet there are sufficient demonstrations  that if God had a people there whom he felt to  especially bless the land would be a good land much  to be desired. There is a good deal of vacant  land in various parts of Gallelee and alto also on the Jordan and on the other side in the  country that Manassa  inherited. ##Deuteronomy 29:8## This land may be obtained by ferman  from the Sultan, and much easier if it can  be had through the natives as we will be able  to do, as the Turks are more or less afraid of  foreignors.  There is no price on land in Turkey. It is  cheifly disposed off in Turkey as gifts and in order  to obtain these land gifts, backshish, or money  gifts are nessesary. The heaviest expences are  here, hence we have no certainty how much it may  cost. It will, however, not depend on the quantity of the Land only to advance the backshish.  I have no idea that we can do much less  than 30,000 dollars and it may take much  more. And then it will take something to cover ex pences pending the transaction which generally takes ENDENTRY long in Turkey as they are a slow, easy-going people.  First a permit would be nessesary to go to Palestine  to locate land and to make the nessesary surveys. Then we would have to return to Constantinople to  finish negotiations which would take some time  because in obtaining land and title it would be  nessesary to have our rights and privileges as  a religious body properly defined.  Should an effort on our part to build up the  land of Israel at this time be right before the Lord  and His servants, I would suggest that the Brethern  appointed to locate lands and to negotiate for  their purchase make it a point to be there about  March or April, because the heat is oppressive in  summer and the country almost impassable in  the rainy season in the winter. Some time would  also be necessary to obtain the nessesary papers from  the Sultan and Sorte to travel and locate lands, for  this reason time should be alowed from home  in order to prevent rushing.  For the good of the work of the Lord in the  Orient, I would respectfully ask your early consideration regarding this matter, as I  do not see how we can do much there  until we do something permanantly  for the redemption of the Land of Israel and  thus come into closer communication ENDENTRY with the people. There are many millions of peo- ple to whom we can testify, and for whom we can do much good if we become in closer contact with  them; and then we could do much of the mission  work with native help.  I feel that a sufficient number of good  familyies should be called from Zion to go to Palestine  to settle permanantly and not expect to return  very soon at any rate. The land is good and a  land of promise, and I see nothing to which any one in  terested in this great Latter-day-work could ofbject to  so far as moving there to live is concerned. It will  furnish a new and interesting feature in our  mission work, and if honestly and faithfully engaged  in cannot fail to bring down the smiles and  approbations of our heavenly Father.  In conclusion let me say I feel specially  blessed and privileged in my labors and that  I feel indevidually much benifited and hope God  will give me grace to put it to good use.  Praying God ever to bless you with His  Holy Spirit and to protect you from all evil, and ever praying God to deliver His oppressed  people, I am as alway your humble servant,  F. F. Hintze.

To the Ffirst Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints:  Beloved Brethren,  It becomes my painful duty to commnu- itcate to you the sor^r^owful news, that our dear Brother in Christ, and fellow laborer, Elder Edgar D. Simmons, departed this life  day before yesterday, Tuesday, ^the^ 4th of February 1890 at 2 p.m. after sickness of 2 weeks, of  which the last 8 days have been very painful. He died onf the small pocksx, his last moments, however, were peaceful. His voice began to fail him ^gradually^ during the last days of his sickness,  and during the last day he was allmost unable to speak, but he was able to understand questions put to him.  This is a sorrowful event for the whole Church of Jesus Christ as also for the relatives of the deceased, but it is a consolation to us all,  ENDENTRY that he died as a faithful member in the church of Jesus Christ.. The funeral took place yesterday, February 5th at 3 p.m. in the Armenian cemetery. The Protestant Priest told Brother "Vezirian," that, provided we wished it so, he would speak at the services; and on account of my inability to make a  speech in the Turkish language, I gave my conseant. At the a^p^pointed time he came, and after the body was put in the coffin, he spoke in the house as well as also afterwards at the  grave.  I have dressed our departed brother as well as I had understanding to do, and ordered  the coffin painted white. I found at the arrival of the coffin, that it was covered with white cloth, tacked all over it, and on the  corners and edges were black strips and black rosettes, fastened with brassheaded nails. On account of it being allready over the above the allotted time to keep a corpse, we had to  hurry to put the body into the coffin, and  left every thing the same way as described.   ENDENTRY I do not the address of Brother Edgar D. Simmons' relatives, therefore I ask  you, the first Presidency of the Church, to kindly inform them as also likewise to express  to them my best regards and condolence.  It would have given me great satisfaction if Bro. Simmons could have returned to his beloved ones at home, but God had ordained  it otherwise. It was a hard time for the  departed, because he had the malady in the very worst degree.  Just now I received a telegram from my stepfather Haifa, ^Syria,^ to leave this  place, and therefore, as fast ^soon^ as I can make it possible to go, I shall do so, and will take  Bro. Simmons' effects with me to Haifa, and his relatives can write to me there their address  and directions concerning his things.  Please let this suffice, as theis letter has to be  posted right away.

I am also  very thankful to the good Mr Sjodahl for having visited me  often during my sickness. ENDENTRY You must have heard ere this that he with the aid of some of  the Saints have Baptized about  a fortnight ago two of my country- men who for a long time past are  very desirous to go to Utah and  if they could be pecuniarly helped  in attaining that object I am  fully persuaded that when they  return they will be of great use  not only to those who have been  their benefactors but also to their  own country-men. I was glad to  hear that the scheme mentioned  in my letter to you with regard  to the establishment of a Colony  and a mission in Palestine has  ben set before you for consideration  and should ever such a  project be carried out I shall  not only endeavorer to forward  Your interest as much as lieth in power but I hope to be  ENDENTRY able also at the time to present  you (as a gift) in virtue of a  legal title Deed a suitable  plot of ground for a cemetery  for a Mission House and a garden  joining it—Six Thousand square  pics or ^about^ one and a half English acre  would be necessary. The locality  of the suggested Colony should  not be farther than twelve of  Fifteen miles from this Town  The price of land for building  purposes varies according to  situation and distance from the  town of Jaffa for instance at  a quarter miles' distance is from  five shillings to ten shillings the square pic (a square pic is equal to two thirds of an  English yard farther on from  one to five shillings from  square pic. The prices here  given are these of the land ENDENTRY which is situated on the South of  Jaffa where Christians mostly liked  for being the healthiest locality  in the neighbourhood  The price of land for a colony  is from 35 to 50 Thirty Five to Fifty  shilling each acre and I would  before going further draw your  attention to the fact that the Heads  of the Christians Churches here  are apt to make great difficulties  and opposition to any new settlers  coming here to buy lands in  Palestine whatever their persuasion  may be therefore these Prelates  will be very injurious to the cause  if they knew before hand what  your purposes are consequently  I would hereby suggest that if  ever it should come to pass that  you should decide to buy land here  please to send out for the  execution of the same one of  ENDENTRY the latter day Saints known  amongst you as being wise, cautious and discreet otherwise  the whole plan (hoped for) will  prove totally a failure but I  think that if Mr Sjodahl should remain in Palestine  until such a time comes he  would be just the person to  carry it out  Please remember me kindly  to all the Bishops Elders and  Patriarch of your church and  with kind regards to yourself  Believe me to be  Respectfully and most  truly Yours M.

But I thank God for His mercy towards me and especially for the light He has given me through  His chosen servants of the gospel.  When I came here to Palestine, I was soon made aware of the fact, that I was placed face to face with millions of human beings, to whom the latter-day message has never sounded.  I mean the Arabian speaking nations, who are scattered all over Syria, Arabia, Egypt and a large part of Africa.  And my prayer to God was that He would lead me and make an opening by which the light of His gospel would shine through.  And it appears to me that the prayers are now being answered, in as much as I have ^found^ several ENDENTRY
