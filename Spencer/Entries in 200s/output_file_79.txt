Moench in a letter of May 14, of the necessity of completing his examination in Drawing, Music, &amp; Logic in the Intermediate Grade which he had not done last year, thus not getting a Percentage in "General Efficiency." I also suggested to him the advisability of preparing himself for the "Academic Degree," as it became necessary for such an important place as Ogden to have its Church Academy presided over by a regular "Professor" by and by. This I wrote in an official letter, of which the copy is on file. In consid- eration, however, of the long and faithful services of Bro. Moench, I wrote him also a private letter of encouragement and explanation. All this Bro. Moench has answered by enclosed letter. I am in favor of Bro. Moench being granted his full papers for the Intermediate Grade without any further examination by order of the General Board, in consideration of his long and faithful services. But the "Academic Degree" he should obtain in the prescribed course of pro- ceedings.

In the first one of these, I found the Seminary at James E.

Brown is a great favorite with the people &amp; stake. Academy at Eli A. Day, Principal, has only 16 stu- dents. Bro. Day was not sufficiently familiar with our system, but is a faithful and hardworking teacher. I parted him soon and made arrangements with him and Bro.

Emery Stake, having made  the necessary appointments for my labors in his stake, I had to leave for Castle Dale early the next morning, in  order to be there at the opening exercises at the Academy. The Principal, Bro. Alexander Jameson, is an earnest worker although in some branches somewhat below the average  qualifications, but diligently endeavoring to make up his  deficiencies. Unfortunately the payment of his salary  is very irregular on account of the financial condition  of the Academy, and he is obliged to own a little  store besides for the support of his family. This is in- jurious to the influence of the Academy, and at the  end of the present acad. year other arrangements in  this regard must be made.  In a conjoined meeting of  the Religionclass Instructors, Sunday School, and  M. I.

This  Seminary is in a far better condition, in attendance as  well as in general standing than the Stake Academy. The members of the Local Board are interested in their  school and are making great efforts to run the school  the full year in future. Bro. Jameson as well as  Bro.

The Saints at Snowflake where disappointed by my not  arriving for their Sunday meetings. This disappoint- ment was caused by the bad and horrible road between Price, compelling us to travel  three days instead of two, thus disarranging my  program by one day. Bro. Edward M Webb, the Principal of the Academy, had not yet commenced his labors to my  great regret. It appears that Bro. Webb had concluded to quit  teaching altogether and that only a short time ago the  Board succeeded in inducing him to resume his  labors. Bro. Webb is a fine teacher but thoroughly  discouraged for financial reasons, having a  large family to support. Meetings for S. S. Teachers,  M. I. A.

The next day, Sunday, Sunday school, Public meetings in  the afternoon and evening, filled out my program for  the day, which was followed on Monday by attending  the Academy fore= and afternoon.

It is with much satisfaction that I can report the fine condition of this College in regard to intellectual pro- gress as well as to spiritual standing and general discipline although it must be stated that it has been somewhat hard at first for Prof. Paul to partake of the spirit of our educational system; in as much as ^during^ the first few months of his labors at the College his usefulness was greatly im- paired by his vigorous participation in the struggles of the political drama and his theological instructions being fixed too much upon the  both of which mistakes Bro.

A meeting of the Seminary Board was held at the Tithing office at 4 P.M., and the same instructions were discussed and unanimnously adopted that had been given at all the Boardmeetings during the previous Circuits.  I regretted exceedingly that the Seminary had closed, and the Principal, Bro. Thomas A. Condie, had left for his home in Morgan City, taking all the records with him in order to straighten them up before June 30.  Bro. Condie has written to me once, promising to have them returned  ly made out before June 30.  I have also instructed Bro. Joseph G. Nelson, Principal of the Oneida Stake Academy, at Pres- ton, to examine those Records after their arrival, and report to me their condition.  It appears from the statements by mem- bers of the Board that Bro. Condie has not given entire satis- faction, having been any deficient in discipline.  This Seminary Board deserves much credit for their energy in providing a handsome building tolerable well furnished, and they are determined to keep in the lead in educational matters at Franklin, although there is a chance now in Idaho to get reliable trustees and teachers for the districtschools. ENDENTRY  John H. Mills, the present Principal, recommen- ded by me for that position by a request of Bp. Johnson, to send someone that could speak  Spanish and understand Music. Bro. Mills has  proved a saviour to the school. The Academy is  crowded, he is assisted by two lady teachers, one of whom is his wife. The latter has to teach the  Primary Dept. in her own home as yet, as the  additions to the building had not been quite  completed. Too much cannot be said of the  devotion of Bp. Johnson, his counselors, and of  the people generally, in making their school a  success. The tuition is free to all the children of  schoolage.

Prof. Paul is ably sustained by his Faculty, among whom Bros. Todd and Apperly de- serve especial montion as the chief standard bearers of the spirit of the Latterday Work in the College. A very pleasing feature of the B.Y. College is the Preparatory Dept. in charge of Sister Hoving, an experienced Lady and Primary Teacher, and fervant Latterday Saint.  Like many other young talented, but ambitious teachers, Prof. Paul was inclined to build up higher classes for scientific and literary pursuits to the neglect of the foundamental branches of education. The objection to such a course does not lie merely in the fact that only comparatively for are prepared to take such courses and the expenses of maintening them would amount in some instances from $150 to $200 for each student per annum, but that such studies require the most eficient teachers of the Faculty, who have to donate their whole time to the instruction of perhaps 10 to 19 students in all, while their labors are taken away from about 200 who are just as much entitled to the benefits of their instructions. In follow- ing up this original inclinations, Prof. Paul intended you to dismiss Mrs. Hoving with her whole department of from 60 to 75 children in order to make room for  ENDENTRY        mitted to Bro.

Monday, March 21, attended the Academy the whole day, met again with the Stake Board after close of school, and ^by request^ gave a lec- ture to the Seventies in the evening. It is gratifying to report that the members of the Weber Stake Board of Education are all active workers in the cause, and under their ju- dicious management that Academy is forging its way to the frontrank among our educational institutions. I made them acquainted with the requirements which, according to the General Circular No. 8, soon to be pub- lished, would constitute a real Academy in our Church- School Organization.

I had the privilege of attending all the exercises of the Stake Academy during the day.  As the Principal, Bro. Jos. G. Nelson had been engaged a greater portion of the academic year with princ concerns in order to establish himself permanently at Preston, an Assistant Principal in the person of Bro. David Hanson has been engaged, assisted by Sister Mete Nelson and Neils  Benson, all of whom were found doing faithful and efficient work.  The records were in excellent order.  Although many of the students have to come daily to school large distances, some of them from 5-6 miles in various kinds of consequen- ces, and even the nearest of them have to walk about a half a mile through sleet, snow, and wind in wintertimes the attendance roll shows a degree of functuality and regularity surpassed only in a few of our churchschools The Academy building is nearing its completion, but the class work has got to be caried on in the basement.

Wednesday, Nov. 9, about 5 P.M. we were kindly  visited by Apostle Teasdale, but have to go at once to  the Academy where all the students had been waiting  for our arrival to have the privilege of shaking hands  with us.

This Academy has had about 200 students registered during this year, but owing to the late opening will have been in session only 27 weeks  Academy-building, although not yet quite finished, is well  much credit upon the energy and good judgement of the Board.

Clawson, and another member of the Board, and the Principal, there being no Quorum present. The Stake Academy had closed for the year at the end of the third term, as it was sta- ted to me by President Clawson, on account of too small attendance. I called the attention of the bretheren to the instructions given on the subject in Gen. Circ. No. 7, ENDENTRY  diture, but also obtaining greater comfort to teachers and students.  The great hall will be a magnifcent and reception hall, but as educational auditorium.  There was a Board meeting in the afternoon with full attendance, and the members felt unanimiuously to carry out the instruction given in behalf of the General Board.  The Faculty meeting was also attended by Pres. Parkinson.  The Principalship of this Academy is  as much as Bis. G. Nelson, will have  nomination for his Standing Certificate or finish his Nor- mal course first.  In the latter case the makeshift arrange- ment of our Assistant Principal may   will be ready for dedication and should not be done on the makeship That same evening I addressed a large log homes, and held consultations with the teachers the day following.  Returned with Pres. Parkinson to Franklin where a public meeting was appointed for me in the evening, which was largely attended. Sudnay, April 30, I addressed the Sunday school of  Franklin in the forenoon, and left at noon with the U.P. train for Pocatello, where I had ENDENTRY  ciety and Y. L. M.

To my surprise I was in formed that the school had discontinued  and the new Seminary building being rent to the District School Trustees. I wrote an explanatory letter to President Parkinson in regard to the mode of procedure in such cases and obtained the promise of proper observance of our regulations for the future.   After having participated in the meetings of the Oneida Stake Conference at Franklin during Sunday and  Monday, April 23 &amp; 24, where opportunities two had been given me to urge upon the people the necessity of true education, I left in company with Pres. Joseph F. Smith and Apostles Thatcher for Preston Monday afternoon, where a large meeting was held in the basementrooms of the yet our  Academy building. The meeting was crowded to  overflowing and addressed by Pres. J. F. Smith, Apostle Thatcher and Lyman, and myself. The Stake Academy had just closed its session, the previous Friday.

There is  some splendid work done by those two in that Academy,  although is not very largely attended just now, having  recieved quite a backset during the recent political campaigne, the Principal having been away on an sta- tioneering tour through Arizona for four weeks. Bro. Cluff is earnestly endeavoring to fill up his scattered ranks. In a Boardmeeting held on Saturday, many resolutions for the successful carrying on of the Academy and of the Religion classes were adoptive and Pres.

This complaint refers also to the Church School Papers, published by order of the General Board. Bro. A. Vance, the Principal of the Box Elder S.

The Stake Superintendent of Education of Idaho, has procured for Bro. Nielson, although entirely unsolicited, a  of the First Grade, to teach in any educational institution in the Stake of Idaho, "in appreciation of his ability and efficient labors as an educator."  On this account I am somewhat arry that Bro. Nielsonleaves that state, as his remaining there would have given considerable prestige ENDENTRY  were yet on exhibition around the walls and were the best ever produced of the Land in any of our churchschools. Bro. Joseph G. Nelson, Principal, assisted Miss Mattie Nelson, Pres. Dept. &amp; Ladies Week, and by Bro. John S. Bingham, Pres. Dept. Bro. Nelson has served his second year as Principal and expects to  settle permanently at Preston, finishing his Normal Course as the Logan next year, but retaining his Principalships at Preston with Bro. Bingham as Deputy. This special arrangement was proposed by me and accepted by the Oneida S. Board, in conformity with a similar arrangement for next year at the Sanpete S. Academy The records of the Oneida S. Academy are in perfect order.   Tuesday, April 26, I arrived at West Portage as per appointment and was hospitably received by Pres. Hoskins, with whom I attended the following day a meeting of the Stake Board of Malad and in the evening a public meeting  Samaria in the educational interest. The former Sem- inary at Samaria has been discontinued for the present academic year and its Principal, joined the Stake Academy at Malad as Assistant Teacher, by mutual ENDENTRY  meeting of the Saints there, who unanimously en- dorsed the  Board to have their school recognized as a churchschool Seminary, with Bro. Anson  Call as Principal. The latter will also apply for  a License under the usual registrations, as also  Bro. Harris, his Assistants, and the lady-teachers at Diaz. We arrived at Diaz, Saturday, Nov. 12, about  3 P. M. just in time to attend the meeting of the Primary. There was also a very crowded meeting of the M.I.A. in the evening. The following Sunday, was occupied  with attending the usual three meetings, at which  the Saints fully endorsed the appointment of a  Local Board for the Academy, and of Bp. W. D. Johnson of Superintendent of the Religion Classes throughout the Mexican Mission. A meeting of the Local Board was held bet- ween the afternoon and evening meetings. Monday, Nov. 14, we started on our return- trip to Deming where we arrived Wednesday,  Nov. 16, about 2 P. M. My most cordial thanks  are due to Apostle Teasdale, Bp. Johnson  and the Saints throughout the Mexican Mission, for the great hospitality shown me; and for the  deep interest they have manifested in our edu- cational movement. ENDENTRY  Woodbury, the Principal, and Miss Woodruff, his Assistant, con- ducting an Intermediate and a Preparatory Depart- ment, comprising 38 students in all, a remnant of about 85,  There is good work done by these two teachers, although Bro. Woodbury, according to his own statement, is lacking as yet somewhat in discipline. I have given him some pointers which, in connection with the instructions he will get in the coming Normal Summer School, may in able him in future to overcome this deficiency. My coming not having been previously known, was not at- tended by any Boardmeeting, but a public meeting in the evening, enabled me to address a large au- dience on the subject of our Church Schools and Religion-Classes.     I spent the evening in conversation with Bro. Geo. J Ramsey, the Principal of the Stake Academy, in order to get posted in regard to the educational condition of that Stake. The attendance at the school has sunk down from 45 to 11, and the Principal reports that the apathy among the people and of some of the ENDENTRY  April the 26 the Stake Academy, conducted by the Principal alone. His school having diminished very much to a great extent, The Assistant Teacher has taken to his farming and saying his last term, leading the Principal alone to conduct all the class of the 3 4 &amp; 5 Readergrades. Bro. Geo Cole is a faithful worker and is improving professionally in a very satisfactory manner. This school is on a solid foundation. The Board contemplates to enlarge the accommendations for the school by proposing a portion of their yet unfinished tabernacle next sum- mer. These improvements can be made at a cour- parstively small expence.  There is yet a very large amount of local jealousy between Ma- lad as to the permanent location of the Stake Acad- amy, which is greatly to the disadvantage of the instututions.  The sooner the General Board would give instructions to have this question definitely settled the better it would be for the educational interest of that Stake. Public meetings at Malad and Portage in the evenings of the April 26 &amp; 28,  movement, have not been, I trust, without some beneficial results.   Arriving at Minersville in the afternoon of Saturday, April 30, where Pres. extended to me the hospitalities of his home during the time of ENDENTRY    Station and the Southern Pacific, arriving at Tempe, Wednesday, Nov. 24, where I was received by Pres. Chs. I. Robson, who took me to Mesa City. There was a meeting appointed the same morning, which was largly attended by the Saints and many outsiders. Thanksgiving Day brought on two more mee- tings, and the following Friday was spent in the new Academy. Bro. Robert H. Smith, for- merly of Diaz, is the Principal.  Although Bro. Smith was not familiar with our system, and I had some apprehension before meeting him, I must confess that he has surpassed by far my expectations, both spiritually and intellectually. I had to give him some pointers for his guidance in future, of course, but he is doing good work and carries a good influence with him. He is very humble, teachable, and devoted to his work. Saturday was a meeting of the Stake Board. The three meetings on Sunday kept on growing in attendance, that I was told that in the evening meeting there had been as large a congregation outside on the sidewalk and at the windows as there was inside. The Saints here as well as in the Mexican Mission and in Uintah seem to be spiritually hungry. ENDENTRY  my visit that all are speaking in the highest terms of the labors of Bro. Ramsey. Bro. Ramsey is assisted part- ly by one of his lady-students as a tutor, and his own classwork, general management and influence is to be commented very highly. At the Board meeting in the afternoon ^of Friday, March 25,^ the general indifference of the people was made conspicuous by the report of the Treasurer, that even leading men were owing yet their tuition for the 1. 2. 3. &amp; 4 of carrying on that part of their Academy work upon strict business principles in future, and that the Treasurer in his Annual Financial Statement to the General Board on July 15% should not only state the amount of unpaid tuition but also the number of parties  whom that indebtedness was due, for it might perhaps occur to the General Board to ask for the names. That shot will sound secure the payment of the greater portion of the amount, as some leading men ^I dared say^ would sooner pay twice the amount then have their names brought before the General Board, in such a way. As it is very doubtful if the Stake Board will secure the Courthouse at ENDENTRY  the rest of the Saints in a four hours' meeting under the in- fluence of the Spirit of God in a very marked degree, when I also found time to perform the duties of my mission. A very pleasant meeting of the Stake Board was held in the afternoon and evening, after which an adjournment was taken to attend a public meeting especially arranged for me. The subject of Religion-Classes formed the chief topic of my remarks. Monday, May 2 Here the Principal Bro. A. F. O. Nielson conducted the Primary Dept. inclusive of III &amp; IV Readers alone; the larger students, constituting the Intermediate Grade, having had to quit for the 11 term on account of farm work. Outside of the B. Y. College I have seen no where among our churchschools such splendid primary work as there is being done by Bro. Nielson. Although the new Academy building is not quite finished, it is sufficiently so that both stories can be used by the Ac- ademy to advantage. That small Stake, thinly popu- lated, composed mostly of non settlers struggling with the arid soil for a living, calls forth my admiration for their faith and united energy to make their Academy ENDENTRY  the pleasure of an hour's conversation with Governor Zulick,  who appeared to be warm friend to our people. I arrived  at Oakland, Thursday,  received by Bro. John L. Dalton, at 16 day was spent in visiting Saints in Oakland and San  Francisco, and taking a drive to the Cliffhouse in - the midst of a trenching rain. Saturday more visits  and some writing. Sunday two meetings to small congregations with some strangers. Bro. Dalton is  much handicapped in his movements to hunt up some old members of the church in Las Angeles, Sacramento, and other places for want of funds. I started for home, Monday, Dec Tuesday night.     Public Meetings, visited 8 churchschools, and organized  several educational Boards, being about from  Oct. 17 to Dec. 6, being 50 days in all.     ENDENTRY  serious concern what to do in case of such a dis- appointment, the more so, as Bro. Ramsey would be willing to make his stay permanent one, if the people should desire it so. Otherwise, Bro. Ramsey would be a valuable acquisition to anyone of our churchschools.     that the Summit Stake Academy had closed at the end of the third term with a "handsome attendance and a very creditable examination", I know that I should not have the privilege of visiting the school, but hoped to meet with the Board and with the Principal, and then got some idea of the condition of affairs and of the work done. On my arrival at Coalville, Saturday, March 26, at 6 P.M. I found that the Principal, Bro. Geo. Middleton, had left for his home in the South, and that there could be no Boardmeeting on account of the absence of most of the members. Bro. Middleton is going to withdraw from the educational field as he wants to go east in the fall to study Medicine. I am sorry for this unceremonious way of quitting a labor which that young man has performed to the benefit of his pupils and much credit to himself. ENDENTRY  in spite of the pleadings of the people. He desires to pur- sue his studies for qualifying himself in higher grades I shall be crowded for Principals next year, as several others have given notice to quit for the same reason, and the sufficient supply of qualified persons for such positions becomes excedingly doubtful.     to reach Market Lake, arriving at my destination Wednesday afternoon, May 4 and made me comfortable at his house at Rexburg. Thursday, May 5 ducted by Bro. Chas N. Watkins, as Principal, and Sister  Barnes, Assistant. The school has registered for this II Term about 75 students, all the way from the  to the V Readergrade, although of the latter are only a few left, the rest had to quit on account of farming. Bro. Watkins has infused new life into the educa- tional affairs, and so ably assisted by Sister Barnes The great drawback for the further development of this Stake Academy is the schedule refusal of all  the Wards  the Academy in any way either by sending students or with means. This feeling extends to the public meeting and to Quarterly Conferences. When holding meetings by appointment at Eagle Rock, which  ENDENTRY   all the Records of the Academy, to be kept according to Gen. Circ. No. 7, page 17, all of which I found in good order, and stated to me the difficulties with which their Academy had to wrestle from the beginning, having had to change its locality four times already since its organization. There is, however, a prospect of securing either one of two fine houses, well suited for schoolpurposes at comparatively low figures, if they could hope for some assistance in that direction. As in all the other Stakes visited during this fourth circuit, the Religion-classes in Summit Stake have been sadly neglected in some Wards, in consequence of which I arranged with Pres. Cluff to attend their Quarterly Conference. May 11, 12, &amp; 13, on my return from Idaho, for the purpose of explaining to the Bishops that na- ture and mode of operation of this educational feature. Similar arrangements were made in Ogden and Brigham City. Sunday, March 27, I  day School, a Public Meeting conjoined meeting of three M. I. Associations in the ENDENTRY        Smith, that I should apply to the respective Stake Presi- dents to send me the traveling expenses, if they desired ^me^ to fill my appointments within their Stakes, as there was no money in the treasury of the General Board of Edu- cation, I have done so and have recieved from all of them already answer in some instances with the ac- companying cash, all the way from Ari- zona.  In conformity, therefore, with my approved pro- gram I started on my circuit around the churchschools of southern Utah, Saturday, October 21 President Paxman, having to attend court at Provo that same day, had left all necessary instructions with the Justin Call, with whom I spent the afternoon in examining the records of the Academy and getting posted in regard to the educa- tional conditions of that Stake. By special invitation of Pres. Paxman I had the privilege of attending and addressing the beautiful Prayercircle, at Nephi, on Sunday morning, followed by a visit to the Sunday school ENDENTRY  the day, Pres. Cluff strongly protested against my star- ting to Park the next morning, de- claring that the heavy storms then raging in the mountains could not be endured by me in the situation I was in, and so I had to cancel my appointment for Wasatch Stake Academy, telephoning to Pres. Abraham Hatch the situa- tion, and returned home, Monday, March  28 Influence, so that I might be ready for Conference.   Your brother in the Gospel, Karl G. Maeser ENDENTRY  to talk privately with the respective Bishops on the subject, and was surprised at the intensity of the feeling existing in that portion of the Stake. The Bishops declare that it is the unanamimous feeling of the Saints on the south side of the river, that they are suffering for want of spiritual nourish- ment on account of the geographical location of their section of the Stake, and that there be no hope for them until they get organized into a Stake for themselves. Although this feature does not belong to my department for discusion, I have to refer to it as it greatly impedes the progress of the educational work.  The predecesosr of Bro. Watkins having not been very exact in keeping the records re- quired in our schools, Bro. Watkins has great difficulty in straightening up his books, but hopes to have them all in order before opening of the next schoolseason.   could not be obtained and some informal conversation bet- ween the five members present and myself have in the edu- cational interest had to take its place. Several meetings with the teachers during Friday and Saturday resulted in arriving at a mutual understanding in regard to ENDENTRY  which it has been my privilege ever to visit. At the mee- ting of all the Instructors after the close of the school, I explained, by request of Pres. Paxman, the harmony of aim and methods existing between ^the^ Sundayschool Work and the Religion Class Movement, on the basis of the Circularletter on the subject, dated Sept. 12. A discourse in the afternoon meeting, and a lecture to the conjoined M. I. Association in the evening concluded my labors for that day.     have our churchschools conducted on the pro rata plan during the present academic year, Bro. Justin D. Call, and his assistant, Miss Mattie Nelson, have assumed all the financial responsibilities of the school, except the fuel, and have met also in this regard with unforeseen success.  The Academy is paying its way very satisfactorily, the attendance being large and constantly increasing.  In the Primary Depart- ment, comprising pupils from the First to the Fourth Grade, inclusive, all seats were taken. This Academy is rapidly passing to the front among our churchschools, and the prospect  is, that the Stake Board will be under the neccessity of enlarging the premises, with the disappearance of the financial stringency just now prevailing everywhere. ENDENTRY  During Sunday, I attended Sunday School in the forenoon, and public meeting in the afternoon, as both of which occasions I labored in the interest of the rising genera- tion     After having filled my appointments made for me by Pres. Eagle Rock, I left the latter place Tuesday, May 10 train and reached Montpelier in the afternoon, Wed- nesday May 11 of Bro. Mary, both of whom are faithful young people, but notyet being graduates, their efficiancy is rather limited in some  respects. It was the best, however, that could be done under the circumstances.  They had to run the Seminary of their now financial risk, but filled the house with about 75 pupils this winter. Bp: Rick and his Associates have succeeded finally to obtain full possession of the grounds and building and contemplat the coming academic year in proper shape. We had very pleasant meeting of the Local Board the Seminary. The Seminary had closed, and I found some of the Records in satisfactory condition, and far to balance missing instructed Bos. Winters, how to keep them, which he promised me to do. ENDENTRY  establishment of Religion-Classes on the basis of the Cir- cularletter, was decided upon, and Bro. J. D. Call appoin- ted as Stake Superintendent. The Recordbook of this Stake Board of Education shows are very punctual attendance of all the members, regular meetings, and comprehension of the importance of their mission. By previous ap- pointment Paxman a meeting at Mona, and the following evening at Leban, in the interest of the rising generation and star- ted for Milford, Wednesday, Oct. 25 on the day following, where I had the privilege of ad- dressing a large meeting in the Second Ward meeting- house the same evening on the usual topics of my mission.     Springs by a conveyance from the former place, as I had to address the people there in the evening by appointment from Pres. Uriah T. Jones. The want of reverence, divine and sacred places, things, principles, and times, and for the Priesthood, which has developed among ENDENTRY        of Grades, Departments, and Classes, in many of our church- schools, a great confusion in this respect had arisen, ma- king an estimate of their comparative standing and labors on my part and a subsequent correct report to the General Board almost impossible. To obviate this difficulty for the future, Church School Papers, No. 20, Juv. Instr. April 15, last, recommended this subject with several others to the consideration of all churchschool teachers, pre- paratory to discussion at our Annual Convention.   Academy, Provo, August 14, at 11 A.M. The proceedings of that Convention are reported in the Church School Papers, No. 23, Juv. Instr. Sept. 1 above stated point, it was decided to refer it to the Board of Examiners for the formulation of a mode of nomen- clature, to be complied with by all our churchschools, as soon that mode of nomenclature should have obtained the sanction of the General Board of Education. ENDENTRY   arrived at Paris Saturday afternoon.       emy had closed its sessions for the Intermediate Grades but were running the Preparatory and Primary Departments in charge of himself and Miss Broomhead respectively.

Miles is an earnest worker, his only fault is a lack of gentleness in his dealings with the pupils. Being exceedingly sensitive himself it is strange how he can be so inconsiderate sometimes with the feelings of others. Saturday, May 14 held at which the numbers manifested unanimously the determination to develop the interests of the Academy and Religion-Classes throughout the Stake. It is impossible to speak in too high terms of the wisdom and personal sacrifice shown by President Wm. Budge in behalf of that Stake Academy, for it became plainly appearent to me that without him that Academy could not have ENDENTRY  upon my mind very forcibly by many observations in this regard that evening, and taking as my text "The Fear of the Lord is the beginning of Wisdom", gave them some object lessons on Reverence. This subject I have followed up on many other occasions since then.  Passing through Cedar in the evening, attended Sunday School in the morning of the Sunday, afternoon and eveningmee- tings.  The necessity of a Normaltraining for Sunday School workers was very apparent in Cedar City. An extenuating circumstance ward condition of their Sunday schools is the pe- culiar occupation of the majority of the people in that region of country viz: The dairy business is ta- king young and old during a great portion of the year into the mountains, thus braking up day-, church-, and Sundayschools; the young people returning late in the fall educationally demoralised, and requiring much time to get them back again into the spirit for studying any- thing.   at Cedar City, is conducted by Bro. Holstein Warner, a Graduate of the Brigham Young Academy, and his assistant Miss Sarah Ann Higbee, volunteer teachers on the pro rata plan.

ENDENTRY  mer the action of our Academy building, the present accommadations are entirely inadequate for school purposes. Sunday, May 15. I attended Sunday School a Quorum Meeting, and  casion I had to bear my testimony to the inspired me nature of an educational work. Tuesday, May 17, I left for  Randolph, where I arrived in the evening, and followed an appointment made for me that same evening to address the people in behalf of     mitted by the General Board with the consent of the Bear Lake Stake Board to assume the title of "Rich County Academy in view of its isolated geographical position, similar to that at Elba, Cassia Stake, where now an  Academy or churchschools building is in progress of erection. The Randolph Churchschool has thus far been permitted to occupy the upperom of the Court- house, but doubts are entertained by the Local Board in regard to the occupancy the coming school- year, which makes the erection of are own school- building a necessity sooner or later.  Bro. Olaf Larsen, the Principal informed me that the school had closed the previous Friday, and that he himself desired to resign. Wednesday a Boardmeeting was held in the afternoon at Woodruff, at which all the members indicated their appreciation of Bro. Larsen's labors with  ENDENTRY  ciplinary condition.  The Board hopes, that Bro. Warner may make his permanent home in Cedar.  The atten- dance in the Intermediate Department was quite low as yet but a large increase was expected at the begin- ning of the next term. Pres. U. T. Jones has thus far carried a great part of the financial responsibilities of the Board on his own shoulders, a circumstance which I have not failed to remind the people of in my public addresses there. At the meeting of the Stake Board after schoolhours. I learned that a Bro. Williams of Kannab, had been appointed Stake Superintendent of Religion-Classes.  I have since communicated with the new appointee in regard to his duties.  A social meeting of the members of the Board, parents, and students, in the evening gave me an opportunity of explaining the necessity of domestic cooperation in an educational system.     third time to take me all the way round between Parowan and St. George.

Thursday, May 19 the morning I started for Ogden, and Salt Lake, in order to be present at the closing exercises of   Friday, May 20, just 44 years ago the same day that I did graduate. Since my resignation as Principal of that instu- tion I have deemed it my duty to watch the drift of wants there  as closely as time and circumstances would permit. Acknow- ledging to its fullest extent the rapid intellectual progress that institution is making since its occupation of its smudge and well adapted buildings, I look, nevertheless, with serious apprehension upon the financial condition of the Academy and the gravity of the situation may compel the new Principal to curtail to some extent the farreaching shemes which he has in contemplation.   Circuits of the present schoolyear will best brought forth ENDENTRY  manner in working out in part his salvation. We left Leeds, Tuesday, Oct. 31, and arrived at the latter place toward evening.  A meeting had been appointed for me here, and was listened to by a very attentive audience, although it appears from several observations that neither Sunday school nor M. I. Associations are in an exemplary condition, and the spiritual energy of the people in that place is in a low condition. There were three lamps illuminating the poor apology for a schoolhouse during that meeting.  These lamps were brough't by some people from their homes when they came to meeting.  Wednesday, November 1 we arrived at St. George. After having attended and addressed the Fastmeeting the next morning, I paid my respects to President David Cannon and to the rest of his colaborers in the Temple, and attended by special invitation a meeting of the district- school- teachers of St. George in the evening.  All of them are interested in the Sundayschools and M. I. Associations, and promised me to take an active part also in the Religion - Classes.  In meeting with the St. George Stake Board of Education the following day, the fact was made apparent, that it was not advantageous to hold the Religion-Classes after ENDENTRY  so much as their general nature entitles them to a more general application throughout our whole Church School Organization.   much by this unavoidably lengthy communica- tion, I remain   Your brother in the Gospel, Karl G. Maeser Gen Supt     Principal Weber S. Academy Ogden.     There is a serious mistake in your letter The Annual Church School Convention is to be held at the Salt Lake City, Friday, June 3 and 7 P.M. The attendance is  upon every churchschool to be repre- sented, or it may forfeit any appro- priation for the ensuing year. You must close your school on that day, and be there with your teachers  tually Board as possible.   ENDENTRY      Herewith I submit respectfully the report of my labors in the Second Circuit, the program of which had been previously ap- proved of by you.     of my intended visit to the Academy, I spent two days, Jan. 10 &amp; 11, in attending the various exercises of the institution, and met with the Faculty at the regular meeting, Wednesday, Jan. 11, at 7 P.M. This Academy surpasses all other churchschools not only in the number of its students (over 900 registered up to date) and of its regular teachers (23), but also in the complexity of its organiza- tion and in the amount of labor performed there, in consequence of all of which the influence of that Academy is recognized throughout all the Stakes of Zion. Besides the regular de- partments graded according to Gen. Circ. No. 7, pp. 19 to 21, there are following special organizations: 1. A Kindergarten Class with about 30 little ones under 6 years of age, with a Normal training Class for young ladies to prepare themselves for that particular feature of education. 2. A polytechnic Class for training in practical workmanship. There are over 40 ENDENTRY  much interest, and especially many boys have to go home to do chores; neither could all the good be ac- complished on Saturdays for the same reasons as re- gards to the boys and many of the larger girls. It was therefore, decided to apply to the School Trustee s to close the district schools one hour at least sooner— one day or two in the afternoon, for the purpose of letting our children have the privilege of going to their Religion-Classes.  This plan has met with much favor everywhere, that it has been adopted thus far since, in Sevier, and Sanpete Stakes. The Stake Academy at St. George has had to suspend operation for this academic year, and Bro. Nephi Savage, the former Principal, has ad- opted a position as teacher in the Districtschools, but has been appointed as Stake Superintendent of Religion- Classes. The same evening I filled an appointment in a meeting at Santa Clara. Saturday, Nov. 4, ad- dressed a conjoined meeting of the M. I. Association of St. George, visited the next morning the Sundayschools, and addressed the meeting of the Sunday Schools. ENDENTRY  at work just now, on account of lack of facilities. 3. A class for military and physical drill, constituting a complete military organization, fully uniformed and furnished from Camp Douglas with a complete stand of arms. 4. a class in Physical Culture for young ladies with Normal training in that branch of study. 5.  Work, Plain Sewing, Fancy, and in all other branches in tht line, fully graded. 6. A class in the Fine Arts, with Painting and Modeling. 7. A Music Department, consisting of three grades in Instrumental Music, and in a "Choral Society" for Vocal Music. 8. The Commercial College, with three teachers, just over 50 students. 9.The Normal Department with a four years' course, counting nearly 250 Normal students. 10. The M. I. Association Normal Course. 11. The Sunday School Teachers' Normal Course. In the face of the immense amount of work which this Insti- tution is performing for the benefit of the youth of Zion, it is greatly to be lamented that the Board of Trustees of the Brigham Young Academy finds itself drifting irresistibly towards financial break- ers, that threaten a catastrophe too serious in its results as that such a possibility could be contempleted with equanimity by any lover of our Youth. ENDENTRY  in the afternoon, after which we took our de- parture from St. George, having been appointed for on evening meeting at Washington. That mee- ting there was crowded, and Karl Gottfried Maeser|I noticed with much satisfaction the presence and close attention of the younger portion of that community. Monday, Nov. 6 addressed a large meeting in the evening at Toquer- ville. As there are several young people from this and other places in St. George Stake attending the Normal Course for Sunday School, and M. I. Asso- ciation Work at the Brigham Young Academy, at  Provo, a vast improvement in these institutions throughout the Stake is looked forward to after the return of these Normals. I am sorry to state however, that one of them, Bro. Jedediah Larson of St. George, died at Provo last week, of pneumonia. Tuesday, Nov. 7, we arrived in the afternoon at Kannarah, and I addressed as per appointment a large meeting there in the evening.  It would be ridiculous, if it were not too sad, to notice the restraint ^under^ which the young men felt themselves obliged to ^ least sufficiently during the meeting, in order not to become absolutely offensive.  "You see, Bro.  so said the Bishop to me, "Stockraising is  never to be seen in decent society." ENDENTRY  Presidency of Utah Stake with the consent of the High Coun- sil have organized and appointed a "Stake Board of Educa- tion", to whom henceforth the "Board of Trustees of the B.Y.A." will be held accountable.  This new Board sustained the ac- tionof the last Stake Conference, to suspend for the pres- ent academic year the operation of the "Religion Classes" in this Stake, in order to give the Sunday School Normal Clasa a fair share to demonstrate its thoroughgoing influence for good.  By appointment of Pres. Smoot I filled an appoint- ment in connection with Bp. Springville, while the Principal and teachers of the Academy filled similar appointments in the other Wards of this Stake, in order to educate the people ^up^ to an appreciation of our educational aims.   In compliance with appointments made for me by Pres. Canute Petersen for the time I had placed myself at his disposal, I started for Mt. Pleasant, Tuesday, January 17  to address a public meeting in the educational interest that same evening, and to visit the Seminary the next day, and met with the Local Board.  Bro. Geo. Christensen, the ENDENTRY  evening a meeting of the Seminary Board was held, at which the devotion of the members under the wise leadership of Bp. Charles Adams, manifested itself very markedly. The Seminary had opened five weeks before under the Principalship of Bro. Frank Cutler, who has accepted the position under the conditions of the usual pro rata plan, and has gained already within that short time the confidence of the community and of his pupils, so that the attendance at his Seminary is daily increas- ing.  His records are in first class order, and his plans, programs, methods, and general progress of his work very satisfactory, so that he expects to have an assistant before long.  His  Much credit is due to the Seminary Board for fitting up and furnishing the Seminaryrooms in such a handsome and suitable manner.

This Seminary is held in one of the former Ward School Houses, but con- tains only one room, in consequences the students are very much crowded, and soon the engagement of an Assistant Teacher, although much needed, becomes inexpedient. The wise and energetic course of Bp. Lund, the chairman of the Local Board, has made the revival of this Seminary a possibility.  It is questionable, however, if the Seminary will be able to run the   full 40 weeks this year; but the Local Board are determined to make all possible efforts for a full academic year the next time. They could have nearly 200 students willing to attend, if they could ac- commodate them.   I left for Ephraim with the afternoon train, to address a public meeting in the evening on the usual topic, and to attend the Stake Academy the whole of the following day. Bro. Newton Noyes, Principal, with Bro. John Peterson Assistant, no lady-teacher. In the Intermediate dept, every seat was taken, but the Preparatory Dept. had a small number of students.

Seminary, at Manti, Bro. Andrew C. Nelson, Principal, and Miss Flora Bean, Assistant. This Seminary occupies its own building, tolerably commodious as far the Intermediate Dept. is concerned, but the Preparatory Dept. is located upstairs, with an outside entrance and a drafty, riggety, and inconvenient staircase leading up to it, forcing teachers and students to go to and fro in all kinds of weather, besides losing a great deal of time, while with a little change in the architecture and comparatively small expense, all these evils could be obviated. The Principal is doing a fine work. I had designed him for the Principalship of the Ephraim, which should have been his proper place, but he concluded to remain at Manti in response to the solicitations and promises ENDENTRY  upon my mind very forcibly by many observations in this regard that evening, and taking as my text "The Fear of the Lord is the beginning of Wisdom", gave them some objectlessons on Reverence.  This subject I have followed up on many other occasions since then.  Passing through Cedar in the evening, attended Sunday School  the morning of the Sunday, afternoon and evening mee- tings.  The necessity of a Normaltraining for Sunday School workers was very apparent in Cedar City. An extenuating circumstance ward conditions of their Sunday Schools is the pe- culiar occupation of the majority of the people in that region of country viz: The dairy business is ta- king young and old during a great partion of the year into the mountains, this braking up day schools, church schools, and Sunday schools; the young people returning late in the fall educationally demoralised and requiring much time to get them back again into the spirit for studying any thing.   at Cedar City, is conducted by Bro. Holstein Warner a Graduate of the Brigham Young Academy, and his assistant Miss Sarah Ann Higbee, volunteer teachers on the pro rata plan.  I am happy to report the Academy in excellent condition both in regard to the required ENDENTRY  is not able to meet the just expectations, financially, of Bro. Nelson, who therefore, in justice to his increasing family, will have to seek for a better position the next schoolyear. As his case is not the only one among our churchschool teachers, but the number of similar cases is bound to increase with every year, thus placing us in the deplorable condition to give young teachers an opportunity to obtain practical experience in our churchschools for a few years, or as long as they are willing or able to look upon their engagement as a mission, but then have to go into the District School Service for better pay, and we start again with fresh beginners, supplying the District Schools with efficient teachers, and keeping in the rear with inexperienced faces. I again recommend this matter to the earnest consideration of the General Board. Saturday, January 21, I returned to Ephraim, in order to attend a meeting of the Stake Board of Education, at 10 A.M; a meeting of the Religion Class Instructors of the Stake, at 2 P.M; and a meeting of the Church- school Teachers Convention of the Stake, at 7 P.M. It gives me great pleasure to report that meeting of the Religion Class instructors, the only one which I have ENDENTRY  ciplinary condition. The Board hopes that Bro. Warner may make his permanent home in Cedar. The atten- dance in the Intermediate Department was quite low as yet but a large increase was expected at the begin- ning of the most term. Pres. U. T. Jones has thus far carried a great part of the financial responsibilities of the Board on his own shoulders, a circumstance which I have not failed to remind the people of in my public addresses there. At the meeting of the Stake Board after school hours I learned that a Bro. Williams of Kannab, had been appointed Stake Superintendent of Religion-Classes. I have since communicated with the now appointee in regard to his duties.  A social meeting of the members of the Board, parents, and students, in the evening gave me an opportunity of explaining the necessity of domestic cooperation in our educational system.     third time to take me all the way round between Parowan and St. George.  I deem it a duty of grateful ENDENTRY  of Zion has taken the lead in this great movement and is maintaining its prestige in this respect as well as in the number of its churchschools, I cannot speak in too warm terms of the influence for good observable among the young people of that Stake. The Normal Class in the Stake Academy is attended by about a dozen students, who are recognized at the Church Normal Training School, at Provo, as "Junior Normals" as "Normals of the First Year."  From that Normal Class quite a number of teachers have been prepared for the district schools, and are giving general satisfaction. Sunday, Jan.22 in the forenoon.

Unfortunately, the exercises were much interfered with by many visitors crowding in notwith- ENDENTRY  manner in working out in part his salvation. We  left Leeds Tuesday, Oct. 31, and  arrived at the latter place toward evening. A meeting had been appointed for me here, and was listened to by a very attentive audience, although it appears from several observations that neither Sunday school nor M. I. Associations are in an examplary condition, and the spiritual energy of the people in that place is in a low condition. There were three lamps illuminating the poor apology for a schoolhouse during that meeting. These lamps were brought by some people from their homes when they came to meeting. Wednesday, November 1 we arrived at St. George. After having attended and addressed the Fastmeeting the next morning, I paid my respects to President David Cannon and to the rest of his colaborers in the Temple, and attended by special invitation a meeting of the district-school-teachers of St. George in the evening. All of them are interested in the Sunday schools and M. I. Associations, and promised me to take an active part also in the Religion-Classes. In meeting with the St. George Stake Board of Education the following day, the fact was made apparent, that it was not advantageous to hold the Religion-Classes after  ENDENTRY  with the school in the forenoon, so that I could get a chance to see its every-day working. It is my custom every- where to address the students during last half hour or so in the afternoon, at which occasion the mem- bers of the Board and patrons of the school are welcome, but not before. According to all appearance, Bro. Miller is a faithful worker and will grow to be a valuable acquisition to our corps of teachers.  There were 45 students of the 5     addressed that same evening a public meeting in Salina, and on the following evening one at Glenwood where I was joined by Pres. Seegmiller. left for Stake Academy for several hours, and met with the Academy Board. At the latter meeting, it was concluded to have the labors of the Academy Board separated from the Stake Board and steps to that effect were taken by the Stake Presidency. The Stake Academy is presided over by Bro. Marinda Halliday, both teachers of a high order. 1500 students registered, among whom 17 Normals of the Junior Grade. ENDENTRY  much interest, and especially many boys have to go home to do chores; neither could all the good be ac- complished on Saturdays for the same reasons as re- gards to the boys and many of the larger girls. It was, therefore, decided to apply to the School Trustee's to close the district schools one hour at least sooner— one day or two in the afternoon, for the purpose of letting our children have the privilege of going to their Religion-Classes. This plan has m much favor everywhere, that it has been adopted thus far since, in Sevier, and Sanpete Stakes. The Stake Academy at St. George has had to suspend operation for this academic year, and Bro. Nephi Savage, the former Principal, has ac- cepted a position as teacher in the District schools, but has been appointed as Stake Superintendent of Religion- Classes. The same evening I filled an appointment in a meeting a Santa Clara. Saturday, Nov. 4, ad- dressed a conjoined meeting of the M. I. Association of St. George, visited the next morning the Sundayschools, and addressed the meeting of the Sundayschool teachers ENDENTRY  a permanent Principal with the beginning of next school year, "a consummation devoutly to be wished" not only here but also in the other churchschools.  By appointment of Pres. I filled appointments in the educational interest at Joseph, during the time from Friday, Jan. 27 until Monday, Jan. 30, on which day I left for Beaver, where I had a preliminary meeting with the Stake Board  met with the High Council of Beaver Stake at which occassion a "Stake Board of Education" was appointed, as the Academy Board has incorporated under the laws of the territory, and its members are under bonds.     Tuesday, Febr 7 in the morning when I left for Cedar City.  During my stay at Parowan I met with the Local Board of the Sem- inary, addressed the Sunday School on Sunday morning, and public meeting in the evening and one in the after noon. Monday, Febr 6, attended the Parowan Seminary, Bro. Jos. A. Sill, Principal, but no Assistant.  Bro. Sill is an energetic young man, very much desirous of improving ENDENTRY  in the afternoon, after which we took our de- parture from St. George, having been appointed for an evening meeting at Washington that mee- ting there was crowded and I noticed with much satisfaction the presence and close attention of the younger portion of that community.

I am sorry to state however, that one of them, Bro. Jedediah Larson of St. George, died at Provo last week, of pneumonia. Tuesday, Nov. 7 we arrived in the afternoon at Kannarah, and I addressed as per appointment, a large meeting there in the evening. It would be ridiculous if it were not too sad, to notice the restraint ^under^ which the young men felt themselves obliged to ^ least sufficiently during the meeting, in order not to become absolutely offensive.  "You see, Bro. Maeser," so said the Bishop to me," Stockraising is capacitated to never to be seen in decent society." ENDENTRY  iar with our educational system, has had a great many difficulties to content with at first, from which he has extricated himself very creditably in a great measure. There seem to be many evil influences bearing upon the young people all through Parowan Stake, which is to be accounted for to some extent by the dairy- business which takes the young people into the mountains a great portion of the year, during which time they seem to be left without guidance or restraint.  Our teachers have a hard time of it in such neighborhoods.   Cedar, Tuesday, Febr. 7 in the morning and addressed a large congregation at the Tabernacle in the morning. Next day, Febr. 8 attended the Stake Academy, Bro. Mary Middleton, Assistant.  Bro. McCarty is a very efficient teacher, of a College training, and a splendid disciplinarian. I have  some misgivings as to his spiritual standing as he is the offspring of an apostate family, but have been most agreeably disappointed.  Bro. McCarty has had the difficult problem to solve, to build up a school that had been going down to the very verger of  ENDENTRY  evening a meeting of the Seminary Board was held, at which  the devotion of the members under the wise leadership of Bp. Charles Adams, manifested itself very markedly. The Seminary had opened five weeks before under the Principalship of Bro. Frank Cutler, who has accepted the position under the conditions of the usual pro rata plan, and has gained already within that short time the confidence of the community and of his pupils, so that the attendance at his Seminary is daily increas- ing. His records are in first class order, and his plans, programs, methods, and general progress of his work very satisfactory, so that he expects to have an assistant before long His students comprise the 6, 7, &amp; 8 Much credit is due to the Seminary Board for fitting up and furnishing the Seminary rooms in such a handsome and suitable manner.  A reception to endorse me by the Authorities and People of Parowan in the evening, I accepted only in my capacity as a representative of the General Board of Education in whose name I thanked and congratulated them for their appreciation of the aims of that honorable body, and expressing the hope that ENDENTRY  minor details in method in order to harmonize his labors more with those of our other churchschools belong to our mutual correspondence.  There are about 120 students re- gistered.  After the close of the Academy exercises, a Board- meeting was held, at which it was concluded to organize a Stake Board of Education, in order to avoid in future that deplorable condition of "Local Jealousy" that in so many instances already has obstracted the best interest of our  educational organization.     my destination Friday, the 10 attended during Saturday a meeting of the High Council of the Stake in the forenoon, and a funeral in the afternoon, I spend the morning in consultation with Pres.

There was a meeting of the Stake and of the Local Board of Education held at the Tithingoffice that evening, at which the earnestness of the members in their endeavor to make their church school system a success was demonstrated beyond a doubt. Sunday, Nov. 12. visited in com- pany with Pres. White and my son Reinhard, the Sundayschool Superintendent, the three Sunday- schools of Beaver, and addressed a Sunday School ENDENTRY  Bro. Charles H. Miles. It is a pity that such excellent work has to be done under such unfavorable almost unwholesome conditions. Bro. Savage deserves special commendation for his devotion to our Church School Organization and his Stake Academy in particular. He has labored now five years in that position in St. George under sometimes very discouraging cir- cumstances.  In appreciation of his devoted labors, the members of the Board have secured him now a desirable home upon their own personal soverinty. The following day a meeting of the Stake Board was held, at which it became apparent, that there was no need for the present for organizing a separate Stake Board.  During that day, I also visited the District Schools, and paid my respects to Pres. McAllister and the other brothern at the Temple, spending several hours with them with much profit to myself. In the evening went with Pres. Santa Clara and addressed a large meeting there, returning to St. George the same night.  Wednesday, Febr. 15, went with Pres. McArthur to Leeds, where we held a large meeting in the evening. Thursday, Febr. 16, I parted with Pres. McArthur, starting for Kanarah, where the same evening a large mee- ting was held the next day I started for Beaver, via ENDENTRY  and the Sunday School Normal Course, at Provo, as this Stake has as yet no representative at the Normal Course. Addresses in the afternoon meeting and ^at^ the conjoined M. I.

The Methodminister came on the stand after the meeting and thanked me in behalf of himself and the children for my instruc- tions on "Reverence."  That same evening I addressed a crowded meeting at Elsinore. It is very gratifying to me to notice in all the places mentioned in this report, that former students of the Brigham Young Academy, are honoring their former training ENDENTRY  Febr. 18, in the afternoon.  Sunday, Febr. 19, as usual I had to address the Sundayschool, and after that a meeting of the Sundayschool teachers, in the afternoon a public meeting, and in the evening a Conjoined meeting of the M. I. A. Tuesday, Febr. 21, started with Pres. Minersville, where I addressed a public meeting in the morning in the interest of the rising generation.     to this circuit,  it is my duty to state here the reason for this omission.  After some fruitless endeavors to secure a Prin- cipal for Panguitch Stake Academy, I succeeded in obtain- ing a candidate for the position upon the recommenda- tion of Prof. Talmage. The person, however, did not suit Pres. Crosby and was dismissed by him after 5 weeks labor.  Thus was brought the acad. year for that Academy to a sudden end. There is a L. D. S. Seminary, at Escalante, of the same stake, in a flourishing condition, and a petition from that Local Board, en- dorsed by Pres. Crosby in behalf of the Stake Board is herewith enclosed. The Principal of that Seminary, is a ENDENTRY  of their respective communities.  There are a few exceptions and they'r in every instance, are avoiding to meet me. During all Sevier Stake I had the privilege of enjoying the company of Bro. Seegmiller in whose absence the former took me around the Stake. We arrived at Richfield, Wednesday, Nov. 15. in the forenoon, the remainder of which I spent in the Allen R. Cutler, Principal, and Mrs. Merinda Halliday, Assistant.  They labor like all the rest of churchschool teachers as volunteers under the pro rata plan, and are keeping a most excellent school. Records, organisation, work, pro- gress, and spirit, are everything that can be desired, and are duly appreciated by the Au- thorities and the people. Here as in all other schools which I am visiting, I addressed the pupils, and visitors, during the last hour before closing in the afternoon on some essential edu- cational points. By special request I delivered a public lecture in the evening  with the Stake Board in the Tithing office after school on the subject of Religion-Classes. Bro. Allen R. Cutler was appointed Stake Superintendent. My labors in Sevier Stake concluded with meetings at Salina,  ENDENTRY  cordial support of the people at Escalante. In regard to the Millard Stake Academy I have to report, that my appointment for that school had been duly forwarded to Pres. I. N. Hinckley, but receiving no answers I happened to inquire at Sevier from a citizen of  what the matter was with Fillmore. I was informed that that Academy had broken up at Christmas, and that Alma Greenwood, the Principal, had got off the track in bad shape, and that the M. I. Associations of the whole Stake had likewise gone down. Thereupon I canceled my appointment for Millard Stake in a letter to Pres. Hinckley, to which, however, I have no answer either. As Alma Greenwood has applied to me for his Certificate as a Church School Teacher, I respectfully ask for instructions, what to do in the matter.     from Milford, and attended the Stake Academy the day following Principal Justin Call is a rising young teacher of splendid qualifications, willing to be taught, and very earnest in his work.

But before arriving at Gunnison proper, I had to meet unexpectedly the Sundayschool children with their teacher at the "Gunnison Field" at 11 A. M. and address them, after which we were received at 2:30 P.M. at Gunnison by the students of the Seminary with their teachers, which also necessitated an address to them at the Seminary, which meeting was attended by many parents. There had also been announced a lecture for the evening which duty I performed also to the best of my ability, but I confessed after that I was somewhat tired for once.  Sunday was spent in visiting and addressing the Sunday school, likewise a meeting in the afternoon, and a meeting of the Sunday ENDENTRY  next academic year, we may be justified in counting on him for valuable services in the future.  Miss Mattie Nelson, his very efficient lady-teacher, is unfortunately at this time seriously ill, and her department, in charge of a makeshift substitute, is suffering accordingly.  After having met with the Stake Board of Education, I inten- ded to leave for home, Saturday Nov. 25, but Pres. W. Paxman insisted upon me staying at Nephi over Sunday.  During that day my time was filled up as always by addressing the Sunday school in the forenoon, and the public meeting in the afternoon, and a Wardmeeting in the evening.  Monday, Febr. 27, I spent the forenoon at the Academy, assisting the Principal in introducing the Monitorial System, myself acting for the time being as Monitor.

Peterson requested me to prolong my stay until Satur- day, Nov. 25, as that would be the only day at which all the Religion-Instructors of the Stake could meet and this I consented to do, and my time until then was filled out with visiting the Stake Academy, Principal and Teachers of last year continuing, mee- ting with the Stake Board, giving a lecture to the conjoined meeting of the M. I. Associations, re- ceiving a reception one evening similar to the one at Parowan, and finally meeting with the Religion-Class Instructors of the Stake, Sunday school Instructors, M. I. Associations Officers included.  There was a large meeting that Saturday, at 10 A. M. The Religion-Classes of Sanpete Stake have thus far taken the lead in this matter throughout Zion. This closed my circuit lasting just 5 weeks to a day.    ENDENTRY  President Wilford Woodruff, Dear Brother,   since the establishment of our Churchschool System  only fifteen have been in operation during the last  schoolyear.  The reasons of the closing down of so many  churchschools have been twofold.  the first is the finan-  cial inability of the Boards of Education to continue  their schools without some appropriation either from  the people or from the General Board, and the  second is the inability of the teachers to continue  their labors any longer at the pro rata plan, as the inducements to enter the districtschool service  for better salaries became too strong for some. Although several were holding on as long their  circumstances would allow, and a few are  yet faithful to us at the same rate. The schools in operation during last year are as  follows:   38 weeks.             8. Oneida S. Ac J. E. Dalley. 4 terms     ENDENTRY        15.  Juarez Academy.  D. E. Harris.  3 Terms.

It is my pleasant duty  to report a reawakening of the interest in our educational  systems both in regard to Churchschools and Religion Classes not only in the two Stakes named but also in a great  many other Stakes.  This statement is based partly upon  my own personal observation and partly upon my extensive and continuous correspondence.   work.  The Brigham Young Academy at Provo is a model institution especially in the socalled Training school. since this division of the Academy is occupying its new  quarters. I suggest, however, that the ^draft for the^ new plan and Circular  for the next schoolyear be submitted first to a Committee of the of the Local Board for review &amp; approval ENDENTRY  three Colleges, that should represent the climax  of our educational organization, I should re= spectfully suggest the establishment of same, Highschools with the necessary three years' course, on a plan similar to the one published as  suggested thus far by the Territorial Teachers' Convention of Oct. 6, 1894, with such modifications  as the General Board may deem proper to make. I suggest that the Stake Academi'es at Pres- ton, and Ephraim be enabled to organized in  that way.   as President of the University of Utah makes his con- tinuance as a member of the Board of Examin- ers inexpedient in several respects, and if the  General Board should decide that  appointment of Dr. Talmage a vacancy in the  Board of Examiners had occurred, I should  suggest that Dr. J. M. Tanner, a former mem= ber of said Board, be reinstated.   have made appropriations  for our churchschools  well nigh impossible for the last year or two,  I approach this subject with great reluctance. But knowing the vast influence for good amoung  our rising generation that has been accom= plished thus far already by our church= schools, I feel it my duty, to present to the Gen= eral Board the necessity for some steps by ENDENTRY  work as far as it is able to, being subject to great inconve- niences in regard to no recommendation.  Since the  partial adoption after my repeated urging, of the  theological, domestic, and moniterial systems, this  College is now  and mind of the General Board.  This statement refers merely to the faculty as I had no opportunity to meet with that Local Board.  The Latterday Saints' College  is doing as good work as far as its present plan  the incovenient accomodations, and the uncer- tainty in regard to its future condition will permit. There are three Stake Academies that henceforth should be definitely reorgnized as Highschools and have their charters changed accordingly.  This step is appropriate  on account of the work done by them and the in- fluence they are exercising. These Academies are the  Stake Academies at Ogden. The Stake Academies at Rexburg, and Diaz are doing very satisfactory Intermediate and Primary Grade work, while the Academies at  Mesa City are still laboring under make shift arrangements.  The Seminary at Huntington has had  a very satisfactory run for two terms this schoolyear. This makes 14 churchschools in operation at present.   the October meeting of the Gen. Board a Committee to reviw Gen. Circ. Nos. 7 &amp; 8 in accordance with the  requirements of the advanced conditions of our  Church School Organization.  In  labors for this purpose we soon discovered that ENDENTRY    Dear Brother,   Education the statistical report of our churchschools for  the academic year 1895–1896, ending June 30 A financial report could not be made out as not all  schools have reported their financial condition, and  some gave only approximate statements.   upon my personal observations and partly upon re- ports from the respective Boards and faculties has  given the following results for the past schoolyear:     Academies, and 1 Seminary 3 in Mexico.     schools during the past year, ^of^ whom 8 hold academic  diplomas, 18 intermediate certificates, 55 annual li- censes, and 5 special licenses. ENDENTRY  churchschools  pening of those now closed facilitated, and the  establishment of new ones encouraged.   gratifying to me to report that my endeavors  to convince Boards of Education of the great ben- efits of permanent engagement of faithful and efficient teachers, have been effectual in  several instances, in as much as the Principals  of our churchschools in Salt Lake, Emphraim, and some of  leading teachers have been laboring in their  respective positions for several years, and are  not desirous of any change.  To encourage this  beneficant condition, I should suggest the  plan, that at some furture time a portion of  the annual appropriation made by the General  Board for our churchschools be set apart  as a premium for such teachers of ours, as have remained five years in our service. This premium might be correspondingly increased at every fifth year afterwards, until a certain worthiness for the respective  teacher's grade be reached.   Examiners have revised Circulars No. 7 &amp; 8,  as instructed by the General Boards, and the  manuscript can be made ready for print  as Circular No. 9, whenever the General  ENDENTRY  copies of Circulars Nos. 7 &amp; 8 would prove entirely insufficient  especially in regard to the requirements for examination of  teachers for the various grades, and to the outlines of studies. There will have to be interpolated a whole course of studies  for the Highschool Grade, and the Collegiate courses  have also to be greatly revised.  I suggest respectfully that these alterations be furnished every churchschool in a typewritten copy and published for general  information in the Church School Papers as fast as  they are required.   and have a large lot of applicants for examination in the several grades before them.  They propose to  hold in future one examination for all such applic- ants.  This examination to be held shortly after the  schools have closed that is at the latter part of June. I should suggest also the holding of a Church School  Convocation during one week at the same time with  the examinations, place, time, and details to be  determined by Committees appointed by the Gen.

His misfortune was that he had a family on his hands, when he should have been free from such anxieties, and that he had called for more missionaries then there was work for them, and finally that neither he nor his missionaries, with the exception of Bro. Williams, were exactly the kind of men needed in this peculiar field of labor. Of great assistance to us were our visitors to the Midwinter Fair from Zion who rendered us financial help by their liberal contributions.

I found the country looking very dry. This was  to be expected it is the dry season of the year. It does not  resemble the green rich looking hills we saw in  April. The country looks white with lime stones &amp;  boulders strewn over a great deal of the hills. These were  covered with grain, grass and weeds when we saw it in  the spring, but now the whole country is cleared off  by man, beasts &amp; the heat. The low lands on the Kishon  were also naked &amp; the land hard as a brick. The  whole nature is slumbering in the heat patiently await- ing the early rains which are due now in a week or two.

I did not go over all  the property, but it look^ed^ like a more gentle rolling hill  country. The water suply rather better than the Gire'.  But owning to presence of more water they have also more  sickness. The fellahs claimed the streams were alowed to  spread in the Valleys below and that the Malaria had its origin  there. As soon as the Water was confined to its proper chan- nals then it would relieve them of Malaria. As  several miles from the Crocodile river and bottoms it seems  impossible that they should suffer from that scourse. They  are, however, on the head waters of that Malarious stream.

Sursuk  by the agressive policy permitted here, had by degrees crow- ded the beduins off by buying a part of the land from the  Government. Had it been safe the Germans as well as the  Jews had long sinse bought it. He also spoke of the land  as being inferior in grade and the country generally un- healthy. He said the Germans had been thankful several  times that they did not buy it. They had tryed the  Kishon country &amp; had lost many lives. To prove that the  property was in dispute he said that one of Mr. Khori's sons  desired to be his first dragoman but the Government ob- jected to his appointment on the grounds of the law suit.  I have no reasons to mistrust the Consul but I will  take steps to assertain more about it in time.

That the Legation of the U.S. had of- fered its good office to help supress Mormonism.  I found  the Marshall was correct.  It appears that in Oct 1887, the  Turkish Government had been stuffed about us opening a prin ting press &amp; that the editor Mr. Hintze lived at Kom Kapoo,  Someone whose name is not attached, came near forgetting  the complaint in his attempt to blackmail Mormonism.  He tells  the Porte that Mormism was a Statuary crime in America &amp;  a disgrace upon civilization, &amp; that they would do all in their  power to help supress Mormonism &amp; to prevents its spread in  Turkey.  It is an interesting peice of deplomacy, cheifly because  of its cowardly attack.  The writer wanted to stigmatize polyga- my but did not dare to mention it where^fore^ he beats around the  corner with interesting eloquence.  On Nov 30. the Consuls writes that he has been notified that the government had re- peeded its complaints, telling the Consul that they did not complain  of the subject matter, it was only the unlawful printing  without permission they opposed.  Consul General Mr. Pringle  then tells the Legation that he had seen Mr. Hintze &amp; that it  was all settled by Mr. Hintze delivering up the tracts. (The tracts in question were a few german tracts published by Elders  Tanner &amp; myself.  The publisher assured us it was allright  &amp; that no one would question it. But an Armenian betrayed us) With this explanation the affair was settled.  About that time  I had had a number of visits with different high of- ENDENTRY  Mormonism. And Mr. Allaimby is authority for the  statement, that the Porte snubed ^the^ Minister by telling  him that the Mormons would be protected as others &amp; had the same right: The Turks saw the sceme and they  were too smart to be caught. I could not get a copy. When  Mr Riddle saw the nature of it, it made him a little nervous  and he said with a smile: "Well, I guess that is all burried,  is it not? I, of course repyed it was. I saw he was ashamed  of it so I did not press it. And although we can ge it through  the State deparment at Washington, I think it best to leave it  til later on.

He  listened with attention &amp; interest. Also Consul General  Dickensen gave me a lengthy audience.   He speaks in high terms of our people. He remembers Presidents Woodruff, Park and others. He has offered me his servises several times. He also  refers to Mr. Strauss, the coming Minister, as a liberal minded &amp; fair &amp; just man. Mr. Strauss is a Hebrew  &amp; as such may do us much good. The reply itself from  the Porte I did not see, but Con. Gen. Pringles letter I  saw and it bears out the claim of Mr. Allaimby.

We, however, found  but little response among the people in Constan tinople, but it soon became evident that  we could do some work in the interior  of Asia Minor, wherefore, I recommended 2 more  Elders to come to my assistance.

In the latter part of Aug. 1888 I  left Asia Minor  with a veiw to see the people and what the prospects  were for opening up the door of life there, and also  to visit the saints in Palestine.

Some  of my reasons for this  ^mission^ is so far from our mountain home in Utah that  the expences to tho successful mission are very heavy, hence Elders are  few who can meet that demand, and the expences toge- ther with the strange customs and habits of the  natives tend to discourage the brethern. Then  it is far for the poor saints to emigrate, and they  are but poorly prepared to come to Zion as they are   and mode of living. Again, it is prohibited by law  to emigrate from Turkey; and that to-gether with  the jealousy of our own nation would be against  oriental emigration to Zion. But on the other hand  could we obtain a home in that ancient land of  promise, we could there educate the saints to our  ways and prepare them to receive both temporal  and spiritual progress. The saints there are  fully imbued with the spirit of gathering,  wherefore they are anxiously looking forward  to the day they may be priveleged to gather with  the saints to Zion.
