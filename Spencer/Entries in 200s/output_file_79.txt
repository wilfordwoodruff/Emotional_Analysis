 PERSONAL AND POLITICAL WORK.The idea of the clipping business was firstdeveloped in personal lines, and in them its appli-cation is so obvious as hardly to need explanation.Public men, authors, artists, actors, musicians, —all are interested in what the newspapers say ofthem, or the things in which they are concerned.To the political candidate the Bureau is a bigboon. The bulk of the clippings come from papersthat he does not ordinarily see, cannot easily get at,has not time to read. From them he learns thestrength and the weakness of his opponent, seeswhere he can fortify his own candidacy, learns whatpitfalls to avoid, finds who are really his friends.Campaign committees find clippings useful inmuch the same way. From them they keep postedon the development of the campaign and the natureof the local work.For every public man it is important to knowthe sentiments of his constituents on the questionshe may have opportunity to debate, in order that hemay keep in touch with them, and not needlesslyrun counter to their wishes. Furthermore, clip-pings furnish the material for many a speech andmany a magazine article.So far as curiosity goes, the families of publicmen are often more interested in what is said ofthem than are the public men themselves. Manypersons holding elective or executive offices haveordered clippings partly to gratify the interest ofwives, sons, daughters, or parents.Another element of value in clippings not tobe lost sight of is what may be called their bio-graphical or auto-biographical value. Statesmenformerly had time to keep voluminous diaries;today they can rarely attend to such matters. Clip-pings will serve somewhat the same end.Departments, Commissions, Bureaus, Etc.,order clippings to secure data for statistical work,

 DISCOURSEBYAPOSTLE WILFORD WOODRUFFDELIVEREDIn the Tabernacle, Sunday, May14th, 1882.REPORTED BY GEO. F. GIBBS.I feel disposed to read a chapter inthe Bible; the chapter that I shall read contains, perhaps, a stronger chain of truth concerning life and death, the fall and redemption of man, the redemption and resurrec-tion of the dead, than any other I know of in the Bible.The speaker then read the ##1 Corinthians 15|15th chapter, of 1st Corinthians##, and said:Before proceeding to make any remarks upon this chapter, I wishto say that there is no person whoknows, before entering this building,who is going to address the assem-bly, and, therefore, we have no pre-pared sermons to deliver, it may bea miller, or it may be a mason, itmay be a carpenter, or it may be a farmer, a lawyer, a merchant or otherwise; this practice is peculiar tothe Church of Jesus Christ of Lat-ter-day Saints, and the tendency isto make the speaker, whoever he may be, depend upon the spirit ofinspiration to guide his thoughts and dictate his remarks. And, as ageneral thing if God, through thismeans, gives us nothing to say, wecan say nothing to instruct the peo-ple.I have often expressed my viewswith regard to the position we oc-cupy before heaven and earth, be-fore God, angels and men, and the views of Jesus and His Apostles and Elders as they have come down to us give a key to what I wish to say upon this subject. If there is an Emperor, a King, a President, a ruler of any nation or people, whe-ther a monarchy, kingdom or repub-lic, that takes away from any of his subjects or fellow-citizens the right to worship God according to the dictates of their own conscien-ces, he deprives them of a right which the God of heaven has guar-anteed unto them. These are the sentiments of the Latter-day Saints. We believe in giving to all men freedom, freedom in spirit andaction; we believe in religionists of every creed and faith enjoying theliberty to worship God according to the dictates of their own consciences, which right is guaranteed unto them by God Himself; and the man or set of men that would de-prive their fellows of this God-givenright assumes a responsibility thatthey must answer for before thebar of God. If I had the power and control of the whole world I wouldnever think of depriving any man, woman or child of this natural; this inherent right, whether their reli-gious views were true or false. Can you find from history that God at any time forced any man to heavenor Hell? No, you can not. And weas  Latter-day Saints claim this rightand privilege for ourselves to wor-ship God, to believe in God, and tobelieve in the records of divine truth—the Bible, the Book of Mor-mon, the Doctrine and Covenantsand the revelations of God.A public speaker, a teacher of thepeople is held responsible before God and his fellowmen for the doctrine he teaches; if he teaches any other gospel than that laid down in the Bible and taught by the ancient Prophets and Apostles he is under condemnation, no matter who he may be. Paul realized this fact so keenly that he, in speaking about iton one occasion, said: "Though weor an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you,let him be accursed;" [##Galatians 1:8##] and he re-peats this sentiment two or threetimes over.I wish to say a few words on one ofthe verses I have read, the ##1 Corinthians 15:22|22nd##:"For as in Adam all die, even so inChrist shall all be made alive." The world, more or less, has found agreat deal of fault with Mother Eveand with Father Adam because of the fall of man; what I have to say with regard to it, I express as myown opinnion. Adam and Eve came to this world to perform ex-actly the part that they acted in thegarden of Eden; and I will say, theywere ordained of God to do what they did, and it was therefore ex-pected that they would eat of the forbidden fruit in order that man might know both good and evil bypassing through this school of expe-rience which this life affords us. That is all I want to say aboutFather Adam and Mother Eve. Adam fell that man might be, and men are that they might have joy [##2 Nephi 2:25##];and some have found fault withthat. It has been said that God commanded Adam to multiply andreplenish the earth; and it has been said that Adam was not under the necessity of falling in order tomultiply and replenish the earth, but you will understand that thewoman was deceived and not theman; and according to the justice ofGod she would have been cast out into the lowly and dreary world alone and thus the first great com-mand could not have been complied with unless Adam had partaken of the forbidden fruit. We acknow-ledge that through Adam all havedied, that death through the fall must pass upon the whole human family, also upon the beasts of thefield, the fishes of the sea and thefowls of the air and all the works of God as far as this earth is concerned. It is a law that is unchangeable andirrevokable. It is true a few havebeen translated, and there will be living upon the earth thousands and millions of people when the Messiahcomes in power and great glory to reward every man accord-ing to the deeds done inthe body, who will be changedin the twinkling of an eye, frommortality to immortality. Never-theless they must pass through theordeal of death involved in thechange that will come upon them. The Savior himself tasted of death;He died to redeem the world; Hisbody was laid in the tomb, but it did not see corruption; and after three days it arose from the graveand put on immortality. He wasthe first fruit of the reuurrection. There was no prophet, no saint or sinner, from the days of FatherAdam to the days of Jesus that ever rose from the dead through the keysand power of the resurrection. Al-though we read of some who wererestored to life, but this was notwhat is termed the resurrection.With regard to redemption, Paul said: All the children of Adam areredeemed from the fall by the aton-ing blood of Jesus, and all infantsare redeemed as well as other peo-ple. [##Romans 5:12-21##] There is no infant or child that has died before arriving at theyears of accountability, but what isredeemed, and is therefore entirelybeyond the torments of hell, to use a sectarian term. And any doctrine, such as the sprinkling ofinfants or any religious rite for lit-tle children is of no effect whatever neither in this world nor in theworld to come. It is a man-made doctrine, and therefore not ordainedof God; and I will defy any man to find in any of the records of divinetruth any ordinance instituted forthe salvation of little innocent chil-dren; it would be unnecessary onthe face of it, and the only thing that can be found is where Jesustook the little ones in his arms andblessed them, which is and wouldbe perfectly right to do according to the order of God. But the sprinkl-ing of infants or the doctrine thatinfants go to hell under any circum-stances is a doctrine ordained of man and not of God, and is there-for of no avail and entirely wrongand displeasing in the sight of God.So much about the infants. I will say again they are redeemed by the blood of Jesus Christ, and when they die, whether of Christian, Pa-gan or Jewish parentage, their spirits are taken home to God whogave them, and never go to suffertorments of any kind.Another subject I wish to say afew words upon: "In Christ all aremade alive." [##1 Corinthians 15:22##] Since the day that sin entered into the world men havebeen held accountable for their ownacts, and it has been known uponthis earth from the day, at least,that Cain slew his brother Abel. [##Genesis 4:1-16##]And sin has presented itself in dif-ferent grades; there are murder, blas-phemy, lying, stealing, whoredom,and abominations of many different forms, which have followed man from generation to generation. For there was a power that dwelt uponthe earth in the form of thousands and millions of fallen spirits, one-third of the hosts of heaven, which had been cast out of heaven with the devil in the great rebellion, whoremain in that condition and who do not possess tabernacles, and they make war upon the Saints ofGod wherever or whenever they are found upon the earth, and upon allmen; they seek to destroy the whole human family, and have done sofrom the beginning until the present day, and they have not ceased their labors nor do they intend to while Satan remains unbound. All the children of men who arrive at the years of accountability are guilty ofsin, all being inclined to do evil asthe sparks are to fly upwards. "Whatshall we do to be saved" was the cry of the people who heard the preach-ing of Peter on the day of Pentecost, and the same may be said to be ap-plicable to all men in every genera-tion. [##Acts 2:37-38##] The answer would be, obeythe law of the Gospel. This is the safe means given for the salvation of the human family. The law of God, the Gospel of Jesus Christ, which Gospel contains the laws of God; itcontains the ordinances, it containsthe commandments, and any manthat breaks them is guilty beforeGod. And I will here say, as I wish to be understood by all men, that our faith is, there never has beenbut one Gospel upon the earththough to-day there are six hundredthree score and six different religi-ous faiths, all more or less diverse one from another; but there is but the one true and everlasting Gospel, and never will be any more, and it is the same Gospel that was taught to Adam, to Noah, to Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and the Patriarchs, and which Jesus and the Apostles preach-ed; it never did vary in the leastin one single instance, nor never will. And I say, if we teach any other Gospel than that which wastaught by Jesus and His Apostles, we teach a false Gospel, and shallbe under condemnation before God, angels and men.What is the Gospel as taught byJesus himself? The very first prin-ciple was faith in the Messiah; this was the first principle ever taughtto man. When Adam, after being driven from the garden of Eden, went to Adam-ondi-Ahman to offersacrifice, the angel of the Lord askedhim why he did so. Adam repliedthat he did not know, but the Lordhad commanded him to do it. Hewas then told that the blood of bulls and goats, of rams and lambs should be spilt upon the altar as a type of the great and last sacrifice which should be offered up for the sins of the world. [##Moses 4:6-8##] The first princi-ple, then, ever taught to FatherAdam was faith in the Messiah, who was to come in the meridian of time to lay down His life for the redemp-tion of man. The second principlewas repentance. And what is re-pentance? The forsaking of sin. The man who repents, if he be aswearer, swears no more; or a thief, steals no more; he turns away from all former sins and commits themno more. It is not repentance tosay, I repent to-day, and then stealto-morrow; that is the repentance of the world, which is displeasing in the sight of God. Repentance is thesecond principle.I have heard many men say, no ordinances are necessary, that belief only in the Lord Jesus Christ is ne-cessary to be saved. I have not learned that myself from any reve-lation of God to man, either ancientor modern. But on the contrary,faith in Christ, repentance, andbaptism for the remission of sins weretaught by patriarchs and prophetsand by Jesus Christ and His Apos-tles. Baptism for the remission of sins is an ordinance of the Gospel. Says one, baptism is not essential to salvation. Jesus not only taught it but rendered obedience himself tothat requirement, not that He was baptized for the remission of sins,but, as He said, "to fulfill all righte-ousness," thus in this, as in all other respects giving the example for all who follow. [##Matthew 3:13-17##] When these principlesof the Gospel are complied with a man is then a fit subject to receive the Holy Ghost; and this holy gift is bestowed to-day as it was ancient-ly, by the laying on of hands by men possessing the authority to ad-minister in the ordinances of the Gospel. These are the first princi-ples of the Gospel which we Latter-day Saints believe in and teach to our fellow-men.Joseph Smith received the minis-tration of Angels, and he by revela-tion organized the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and hewas taught by those who ministered unto him what to teach to the peo-ple, which was the everlasting Gos-pel.Again, men received the Holy Ghost through the imposition of hands, after being baptized for the remis-sion of sins. The Holy Ghost was imparted in that way, according tothe promise of those who preached the Gospel. Joseph Smith when heorganized this Church in 1830 organ-ized it by revelation; and while wehad hundreds of churches and sys-tems and religions, not a single de-nomination upon the earth at that time preached the Gospel as taught by the ancient prophets and Apost-les, or had a church organized on the earth with prophets and Apostles, or with signs following thebelievers as in ancient days. [##Doctrine and Covenants 21:1-3##] Canyou tell of one? I never heard of one until I heard the Elders of this Church preach the Gospel and set forth the order of God. When God commanded Joseph Smith to go forth and organize the Church,what authority had he to do so? None at all until he was ordainedunder the hands of those who had held the keys of the priesthood upon the earth. [##Doctrine and Covenants 27:8-13##] And I will say to this assem-bly, in the days of Jesus Christ He taught these principles to the Jews; He brought theGospel to the Jews and establishedHis kingdom among them, and it came with all its gifts, graces and powers: the sick were healed; devilswere cast out; the gifts were mani-fested among them. But the Jews rejected Him, and they finally putHim to death,—He and His Apos-tles. He came to His own Father'shouse but He was not received; and then, according to command, thisGospel went to the Gentiles—we areall Gentiles in a national capacity, we are not Jews, the Jews areanother class of men; they put the Savior to death, and have suffered for 1800 years in consequence,—theyhave been trodden under the feet ofthe Gentiles even until the presentday. Those that took part in that deed and those who sanctioned itsaid, Let His blood be upon us and our children after us. The GentileJudge was willing to release Himbecause he could find no fault in Him; but the feeling and senti-ment of the Jews was, "Crucifyhim! Crucify him l [!]" [##Luke 23:21-33##] What in-fidel is there, no matter who he is, who does not believe in God, lethim read the revelations of heavenand see the fulfillment of prophecyfrom the beginning of Genesis to our day, and he will see them ful-filled to the very letter. There isnothing that has been predicted by Jesus or the Apostles but what hasalready been fulfilled to the very letter as far as time will admit, and what has not will be. When, I say, the Gospel was preached to the Gentiles it went to them in all its power, its beauty and glory, Priest-hood and ordinances as it was of-fered to the Jews. And Paul, inwriting to the Romans told them not to be highminded, but to fear; for if God spared not the natural branches, who were the Jews, be-cause of their unbelief, how could he be more merciful to the unna-tural branches, who were the Gen-tiles? [##Romans 11:20-21##] Has there been the trueChurch of Christ upon the earth since the Apostles were slain? Can you find a Church upon the earthorganized as it was in that day? No not one. The Gentiles followed theexample of the Jews in their unbelief and in putting to death those whobore the holy priesthood; and in-stead of the Church of Christ has sprung up every kind of Churchduring the last 1,800 years. But inthese the last days, God has again restored the everlasting Gospel; andany man who believes the Bible must believe the fulfillment of reve-lation, and he cannot believe in the fulfillment of prophecy without be-lieving that God would send againto the earth angels to deliver that Gospel. And why send an angel for this purpose? Because the Gos-pel was taken from the earth inconsequence of the unbelief of the Gentiles and the powerful opposi-tion that was brought against the comparative few who represented it. And in fulfillment of the revelationof St. John, John the Baptist came to Joseph Smith and conferred upon him, after a period of preparation on his part, the Aaronic Priesthood which authorized him to preach and to baptize for the remission of sins,and to administer the sacrament, but not to lay on hands for the recep-tion of the Holy Ghost. In due time, however, Peter, James and John appeared to him also and con-ferred upon him the Melchesi-dek order of Priesthood andApostleship, which gave him thepower to organize the kingdom of God upon the earth. [##Doctrine and Covenants 27:8-13##] These aretruths whether the world believethem or not. It makes no difference;it is the work of Almighty God, andhe is the originator of it. How isit with the Elders of Israel? Godhas called men from the plow, thehammer and anvil, from the car-penter's bench, etc., unlearned and weak mortals, and they have been sent out to the world to bear recordof this new and everlasting gospel restored in our day. And what havethey said to the methodists, theBaptists, and all other religionists and classes of men. God Almightyhas given unto me a dispensation ofthe Gospel and I offer it to you; he that believes on the Lord JesusChrist, and that I am his servanthaving His Gospel message to de-clare to all those to whom I am sen[t,]and repents and is baptized for th[e]remission of his sins, shall receiv[e]the Holy Ghost. This has bee[n]the purport of the message [we]have borne to men and nations [for] the last fifty years. And now [if] God has nothing to do with thi[s,] how is it that we have been able [to]gather together thousands and te[ns] of thousands from about all natio[ns] under heaven by the simple p[ro-]clamation of the Gospel-mess[age?]How long would it be before Jo[seph] Smith or any other man who w[ould]go forth bearing the message [like]we do, and making the promises [that]we make, would be found out t[o be]an imposter unless the promises [we]made were genuine and looked [upon]in such a way as to give entire [satis-]faction to those who hearken[ed] his word? The whole secret o[f our]success as far as making conve[rts] concerned is, that we preach [the]same Gospel in all its simplicity [and] plainness that Jesus preached, that the Holy Ghost rests [upon] those who receive it, filling [their]hearts with joy and gladnes[s un-]speakable, and making them [as one;] and they then know of the do[ctrine] for themselves whether it be [of God]or man. And this Gospel of [Christ]which we offer is what has le[d this] Church from its first [organ-]ization until to-day. And, as I [have]often said, had it not been fo[r the]Gospel revealed to us, we [might] have labored until we were as [old as]Methusaleh, and Utah [to-day] would have been as barren as [it was]in 1847 when we first came to [these] valleys. At that time we fo[und a] barren desert, yes, as barren [as the] desert of Sahara, with no ma[rk of] the Anglo Saxon race. But [travel] through Utah to-day and we [find] houses and cities, gardens [and] orchards, meeting-houses and [taber-]nacles and school-houses and [dwell-]ings, with the blessing of G[od at-]tending the labors of the p[eople;] and a community of people [from]almost every nation taken from [the] various sects and parties, and [they]are here through the inspira[tion of]Almighty-God, and I know it. [We have] not had power of ourselv[es to] influence any man or woman [with] regard to these things. They [have]been influenced by the testimo[ny of]Jesus Christ and by the Gosp[el of]the Son of God. These are [prin-]ciples by which all men are s[aved.] All men are saved by and thr[ough] the blood of Jesus Christ, th[rough]obedience to the Gospel.I realize our condition and [the po-]sition occupied by this generat[ion. I]know we are looked upon as [a bad]people, and we are considered [a very]ignorant people. There never [were] more epithets heaped upon [Jesus]Christ and the Apostles than [upon] the Latter-day Saints. W[hy is]this? Are we so much wors[e than]the world? No, we are not. [What]then is the matter? The Lo[rd Al-]mighty has set His hand to [gather]His people, and to build up H[is Zion] and to establish his Church in [these]the last days; and the world [do not]like the doctrine we teach, as [it lays] the axe at the root of the tre[e, and] consequently we have been [perse-]cuted from the time tha[t this] Church was organized until t[o-day;] and the persecution will co[ntinue] more or less until He reigns [whose]right it is to reign, until the [Lord] Jesus Christ comes in the clo[uds of]heaven to reward every m[an ac-]cording to the deeds done [in the]body.Now I want to say to the L[atter-]day Saints, we are called to a [great]work, and we have been ca[lled of]God, and we, as Elders, hav[e gone]forth whithersoever we were [sent,] taking our lives in our hands, [trav-]eling hundreds and thousan[ds of]miles without purse or sc[rip. I]have waded swamps and swu[m riv-]ers, and have asked my brea[d from]door to door; and have d[evoted]nearly 50 years to this work[. And]why? Was there gold eno[ugh in] California to have hired me to [do it?] No, verily; and what I have don[e and]what my brethren have don[e, we] have done because we were [com-]manded of God.

 Briant S. YoungLehi, Utah, Jan. 23, 18967.HON. WILFORD WOODRUFF,Prest. Church of J. C. of L. D. S.,Salt Lake City, Utah.Respected Sir; It is with the deepest interest that I read inthis mornings ^p^aper, of an interview published therein regarding your-self and the members of the Semi-centennial Celebration which is totake place this year, and noting that Judge Colborn was the mainapeaker for the committie, and noting that you were in favor of givingsaid committe $10,000 to aid them in the celebration, I address yourelative to the matter, and call your attenti^o^n to a few facts of whichyou may not be aware.In the first place, does it not appear that we have many of Utah'ssons, members of the church who are as capable, and even more so, of,attending this afafair, without the guidance of such a man Colburn.While true he was appointed by the governor, I yet must candidly con-fess that it reflects no great credit on the govrernor, for this man Col[-]burn came to Utah during the I"boom" and it was such men as him, thatconstituted the "Liberal" party that were so harsch in their condem-nation of the church, and its follwers. It was such men was him, thathave never done anything for Utah or your city, but that it helpedthem first. Can it be said that Utah must needs accept the servicesof outsiders, to portray the efforts of Utah's pioneers, when in factthey know nothing of it, beyond what they may read, or hear, and then-in what do^i^storted, irrelevant manner?Last season, when that Mid-summer Carnival was given, I was at ameeting at which this man arose, and delivered an address, during whichhe used words to the effect that he "was tired of seeing home faces, andwe wanted outsiders to come in and get the benefits" or words to thateffect.Then there is another man on that committee, whom I know well, thatis E. G. Rognon. He is a good, smart young man, but he issnn't a ntive^native^of Utah, neither does he represent her, beyond what affects his ^own^ interestsNow then, I ask you candidly, do you think these the kind of mento handle money to represent Utahs great celebartion, and to handle themoney of the people whom they slightlingly designate as "Mormons?"I am addressing this letter to you, generally, but while I speak forothers, I confess I speak as much for myself.I am a Utah boy; born of its greated^st^ people; a grand-son ofBrigham Young, and the son of Jos. A Young, men who have liaaid ^down^ their livesand liberties on behalf of our church and its noble work. I fought inthe great Peoples-Liberal party campaign, six years ago, and though Iwas a humble worker, my work was at least sincere. I carried a drum,and I hammered at it too, and had all the others made as much noise asI tried to do, the echo of our great vistory (instead of defeat) would godown in counlttless ages. Two years ago, nearly three, I—with someother ^y^oung men, received permission to use the Bee-hive house for ademonstaration for the old pioneers. It was given, and 800 of themwere entertianed, and lived again in the days of long ago. Bills onthat occasion, were a matter of necessity contracted, and one ofthem, I have been sued for, and the judgement entered against me, be-cause I have been unable to pay it. Now, do you call this just? Whatbenefit did I—or any of us get from it? Nothing but that—which is moremoney than money can ever buy—tears of gratitude from old eyes, andfrom old lips, and old forms, within the shadow of the grave, blessedand thanked us for what we done. And that night too, did I not act asmediator? R. N. Baskin, at that time mayor, on my personal solicitationattended, and for the first time in his life, commingled with the"hated Mormons" and grasped them hand to had^nd^Now then, again I ask, why are such men as this allowed thesethings?Can Utah not furnish brains and muscle enough, to dispense with theservices of these outsiders^?^ Ten, twelve, fifteen years ago, when our

See that lall its offi-cers are Utionians -- that no man will receive a benefit, unless it be thereflection of a "work well done."If Judge Colborn works ion this celebration, I hesitate not toprophecy that he will receive as much, if not more benefit from it,than all the Utonians combined, or at least, will receive his share.  All statements I make, I can, and will at any time verify.I therefore ask that you put (or see it is done) on that committtee,more suhch men as Spencer Clawson; C. R. Savage, H. G.

It is not--or should not be the carpet-baggersto control money that the people they hate so, shuld furnish.In closing I beg to ask that you will give this communicationyour careful consideration, and not throw aside as worthless.With deepest respect, and with the iw^wi^sh that God may guide youaright in the matter, I am,Your brother in the gospel,Briant S Young.I beg to state if there is anythingfurther wanted in the wayof information, I will gladlygive it.

 those of Jonah to the city of Nineveh, orthose of Isaiah to Israel, or to Tyreand Sidon and other ancient citiesand peoples, have fallen unfulfilled? No, there is no man can point to a single prophecy of the servants of God that has failed in its fulfilment.Does not the Christian world know that the Bible is full of revelationpointing to this day and age of the world? Let them read the revela-tions of St. John given him whileupon the Isle of Patmos and they will know what judgments await this generation before the coming of the Son of Man. [##Revelation 14##] There is a work for somebody to perform. But whenwe undertake to declare in all seri-ousness that God has anything to dowith the work in which we are en-gaged they will laugh you in theface, and the reason is, they havedeparted from God and are entirelyunable to comprehend His ways orHis purposes; and instead of believ-ing the plain and literal meaning of the word of God they spiritualize it tosuit themselves. Daniel was prepar-ed to enter the den of lions [##Daniel 6##]; the three Hebrew children were not afraid of the fate that awaited them [##Daniel 3##]; the Apostles were valiant for the truth and shrank not from death for its sake, and why could those men andothers under similar circumstancesstand by their convictions withoutflinching? Because, in the firstplace, they had the truth and theyknew it for themselves; and in the second place, the Holy Ghost, theComforter, sustained them as that power alone can in all the tryingscenes through which the people ofGod are called to pass. And this is so to-day. What the Latter-day Saints have done by way of preach-ing the Gospel under all kinds of difficulties, building up cities andsubduing waste lands, and establish-ing themselves in the earth, theyhave done by the revelations and commandments of God to them.I will say a few words concerninga certain principle, and why I say it is because we cannot help looking atthe signs of the times as they ap-pear to-day. I was reading in the NEWS last evening a speech reported to have been made by Joseph Smith,son of the Prophet Joseph Smith,in which he accuses us of pursuingan entirely different course from that of his father; that his fatherhad nothing to do with the endow-ments which form a part of our re-ligious faith; and that his father had nothing to do with the patriarchalorder of marriage; and he accuses our bishops of polluting the womenof their several wards so that they are not fit for wives. This last ac-cusation is so palpably false and soutterly mendacious as to be entirelyunworthy of our notice, and I be-lieve I ought to apologise to this con-gregation for referring to it at all.But it shows how weak must be the hope and faith of men who pretend to be teachers among the people when they descend to traduce thecharacter of innocent men by wil-fully lying in the hope of bolsteringup and establishing their own pecu-liar cause. And with regard to the others, I wish to say, that Joseph Smith utters falsehoods when hesays what he is reported to have said about his father; for I bear re-cord to this congregation, and I ask our young people to bear it in mind after I am gone, that Joseph Smith first made known to me the very or-dinances which we give to the Lat-ter-day Saints in our endowments;I received my endowments un-der the direction of Joseph Smith.Emma Smith, the widow of the Prophet, is said to have maintainedto her dying moments that her hus-band had nothing to do with the pa-triarchal order of marriage, but that it was Brigham Young that gotthat up. I bear record be-fore God, angels and men that Jo-seph Smith received that revelation; and I bear record that Emma Smithgave her husband in marriageseveral women while he was living,some of whom are to-day living inthis city, and some may be presentin this congregation, and who, if called upon, would confirm mywords. But lo and behold, we hearof publication after publication now a days declaring that Joseph Smith had nothing to do with these things.Joseph Smith himself organizedevery endowment in our Church and revealed the same to the Church and he lived to receive every key of the Aaronic and Melchisedec priest-hoods from the hands of the men who held them while in the flesh,and who hold them in eternity. [##Doctrine and Covenants 27:8-12##]I feel to say to the Latter-day Saints everywhere, brethern and sisters, do good and you will reap good; what you sow you will also reap. [##Galatians 6:7##] What our nation sows that it will also reap, and what it measures to others will be meted back to it heaped up, pressed down and run-ning over. I have peculiar feelingsin reflecting upon the condition ofour own nation. Here are the Methodists and Presbyterians andothers all combining to use their influence religiously and politi-cally to put down "Mormonism" which they say is an abominationin the land, and a great stain upon our nation's escutcheon. "O, myGod," I feel to say, "I would ournation could see and understand things as they really are." I wantto ask a question. When the sixth angel sounds his trump revealingthe secret acts of men to an assem-bled world, which will include us, what will be the feelings of the present generation and the rulersand leading men and women of ournation as well as those of other nations, and the leaders of the Christian world when that angel declares unto all those who have condemned and cried against the Latter-day Saints, especially thosewho have taken a leading part, say-ing, "You, yourselves are defiled with women, and your own acts,which are recorded on high will rise in judgment against you. I say tothis nation, and especially to those who are actively engaged in bring-ing about a crusade against us un-der the cloak of religion, "Sin liesat your own doors, and what you measure unto us will, according to the eternal law of retribution, bemeted back to you, and you cannot escape it." [##Revelation 9:13-19##] We declare to all men that the God of heaven commanded Joseph Smith to introduce and prac-tice the patriarchal order of marriageincluding the plurality of wives.And why? Because it was the law given to Abraham, Isaac and Jacobfor certain purposes; that holy menmight have their wives and chil-dren with them in the morning of the first resurrection in their familyorganization to inherit kingdoms,thrones, principalities and powers in the presence of God throughout theendless ages of eternity. Ladiesand gentlemen, the Latter-day Saints are not the people you think theyare; they are not guilty of thecrimes and wickedness they are ac-cused of, but on the contrary, theyare as a people, free from the sins and abominations of this generation. We are represented as being a com-munity of adulterers, and as being murderers. We are no more guilty of such crimes than were Abra-ham Isaac and Jacob. What God has revealed unto us, and that which we know ourselves to be rightand true, we cherish and revere; andthe covenants that we have en-tered into in consequence of the re-velations of God to us, we hold sa-cred. Our wives and children we love and respect, and we could no more deny them their claims upon us as husbands and fathers, than wecould deny our God.Another thing, there is noman that has ever lived who can claima wife or child in the resurrection unless he and she were married andsealed by divine authority by a mandelegated of heaven to perform theordinance of marriage. All con-tracts not ordained of God enteredinto by men, end with this life, and are therefore without binding effectin the world to come. And hereinis the difference of the position ofthe Latter-day Saints and of theChristian world with respect to themarried state. The nature of ourmarriage covenant is sacred andbinding both for time and eternity,and I would just as soon think of denying my God as to sever the re-lationship existing between me and my wives and children. Our pluralwives and our children are just asdear to us as the one wife and thechildren of the Gentiles are to them;and what is more, we have married our wives by command of God, andby authority of His Holy Priest-hood, which has been restored againto earth; and if we prove faithful and true to Him and to one another, we shall claim our wives and chil-dren in the world to come. Amen.

 Department of Justice.OFFICE OFUNITED STATES ATTORNEY,DISTRICT OF UTAH,J. W. JUDD,U.S. ATTORNEY.Salt Lake City, August 23, 1897., 189Wilford Woodruff, President,Church of Jesus Christ of L.D.S.Salt Lake City. Utah.Most Reverend Sir:I am in receipt of a letter from Geo. E. Hill, one of yourMissionaries, directed to me from Waterford, Miss., which I herewithtake pleasure in enclosing to you. Permit me a word of explanation:In more than one instance it has been my pleasure to give aletter of recommendation to your Missionaries when going into mySouthern country, especially my State of Tennessee, as well as from timeto time having by word of mouth commended them to my people there andsolicited kind and christian treatment in their behalf. When Mr.Hill left here last April I gave him a letter—of which he speaks inthe enclosure. Of course, with the detailed statement of Mr. Hill'swork I have no special concern, except that gratification which comesto any citizen upon learning that another is being well treated andis performing a christian work which, let us hope, is always calculatedto better whoever may accept and act upon such teachings. I great-ly appreciate Mr. Hill's painstaking letter to me, for it gives me aninsight into the work that I myself before did not understand.You will note that he asks me for a further letter statingwhat I know of the people of Utah and of the country in general. Ihave by this mail written to him in answer stating substantiallythat I have been all over the State of Utah, from one end of it to the 
 many things. I have not tried to shirk fromany duty that I have been called to perform, forI have been laboring in all callings ^were in I have been called to labor^ in the churchsince I was called to Scandinavia. It istrue that I have many faults and failings, but I am striving to overcome them by the help ofGod, for I know that of myself I am nothing.I have during the last years been laboring asfollows—one winter I labored as a home missionarytraveling from house to house, preaching theGospell. I have taken a 5 months M.I.Acourse, labored as Principle of Religion Classesin 7th Ward, for 2 years. I have been counselor[START HERE] in M.I.A. for a number of years, and a teacherin the Sabbath School, and in all of theselabors, the Lord has greatly blessed me.Dear Brethren, I hope you will pardonme for describing these thing to you, for I do not tell you of these things to receiveany praise whatever, but that you maybetter understand things as they are, for Ithank the Lord for choosing me to labor inthese callings.My object of writting you is this, I am

 other and have mixed and mingled with the people and partaken oftheir hospitality, and that I can say from my own personal knowledgethat a more kind-hearted, hospitable and well-intentioned people donot exist, in my opinion, in any nook or corner of the United States,that a man can go to or from any point in Utah and exercise therights of a citizen of this State, or any State, with as much safetyas he can in any other given point in our country; that there are nomen here who have a great number of wives, such as stated in Mr.Hill's letter, and that polygamy as a system has been abandoned bythe Mormon church; that if any one desires to come to Utah to liveand to be an industrious, good citizen, he can get along as well hereas anywhere, so far as exercising the rights of a citizen is con-cerned.Upon my recent visit in the South I took some pains to in-quire into the cause of the friction that at times occurs betweenyour missionaries and the people, and am able to state to you one,at least, of the causes which is more fruitful of such troubles. Ido this with no disposition to in any way interfere with your direc-tions or the work of your church, but as a piece of information whichI feel might be of value to you. The trouble of which I speak comesin this way: The people of Utah have their system of bishops, coun-selors and teachers, and what are called—as I understand it—homeor house to house missionaries. They not only see no harm in thosepractices here at home, but it is a thing, I take it, that is muchpracticed as well as much appreciated in your system of religiousteaching. Now when these young men get out of Utah they take largelythese ideas with them and when they get down in my Southern countrywhere the people are just as hospitable as they are anywhere on the glo 
 up and have succeeded in getting the roof onthis Winter, but it isn't suitable to live in yet.Now we have lived here eighteen years andhave had nine children born here. We hadtwo children born in Utah before we camehere. We buried our first boy at Sunset on ourway out here. And our little daughter that wehad when we came, lived to be sixteen years old,and was drowned the 7th of June 1893, her namewas Eliza Roxie.Emma Matilda was our nect girl, she is nowseventeen years old, and she has taken a fancyto a young fellow who is not at all worthyof her, and she is so determined we do notknow what to do with her.Now could you advise us to move to an ot-er place or have you a place a farm orsome establishment that you would likean industrious family to come to for weare all good willing workers.The main reason why I would likea change is to get the mind of my

 that they are inspired and directed by his spirit.)"I say believing this," it wouldbe unwisely of me to declinebeing a candadate for that Field of Labor which my name has been suggested and exceptedto labor in. I am determend and ambitious to fulfill this mission honorable, and in prase to ourHeavenly Father; Notwithstanding it being quite a dificulty field to labor in, the people being morehostile than perhaps, in someof the other fields of labor. Yet, through the grace of God I willperform this mission. This is my faith with regard to it.Brothern, I think it realy an honor and a favor shown unto me.It has long been my desireto be a usefull instrument in 
 globe—to which you will see Mr. Hill testifies—they carry thishabit of house to house canvas with them and they frequently visitpeoples houses in the absence of the head of the family and preachtheir doctrine to the women and children. This, you can see is aptto raise resentment upon the part of the head of the family; thentrouble begins. I do not believe that all of them do this, in factI know they do not, but some are sufficiently indiscreet to undertakethe conversion and baptism of the women and children in the absence ofthe head of the family, and you can well see what results a thingof this kind would produce.It is my opinion that your people will be as well receivedin the East as the advocates of any church in the land provided theywill adopt the methods that ministers of other churches adopt; atleast I know such is the case in my State of Tennessee. On my recentvisit I took occasion to talk to the people about the Mormons and be-spoke for them kind and hospitable treatment, and in no instancedid I hear of any bad feelings against the Mormons, except where itarose out of some such trouble as I have mentioned in this letter.Allow me to repeat, that it is not with a disposition on mypart to interfere with your methods that these suggestions are made,but purely out of the great respect that I have for you, of which,on more than one occasion, you have heretofore had sufficient testimonyI am, with great respect,Your obedient servant,J. W. Judd 
 desirous to received some instructions or counselfrom you. I see no chance for me to go to Scan-dinavia at present, for I have no means at all.But, if I could be changed to the SouthernStates or any other place, where I can travelwithout purse or scrip, then I am at yourcommand. Now if this would make no diffe-rence to you, and it be as acceptable to the Lordthen I would like this change. And I thinkthrough the blessings of the Lord that Ishall be able to go and at least do somegood. Ill never fell satisfied until thatI will be able to fulfill a mission, for I lovethe Gospel and know the truth's there'of. Ihave no faults to find with anyone butmy-own-self, perhaps I could do betterthan I have done, but I have been young andinexperient in many things. I have in aweak way tryed to serve the Lord. I havefasted and prayed and gone into desolateplaces and prayed and asked counsel of my Creator(over)

Theyare both dead. Bro Samuel H Rogers had his fa-ther and mother adopted into your family.
