If you can send any  pamphlet or small work giving the Scripure text  and explaningsations of Scripture passages favoring  polygamy and having texts that seem to be   against it you will confur a favor by sharing  a copy. Most people think the New Testament is  distinstly against polygamy and established only  monogomy.

 affairs are of a secondary con-  sideration, when duty calls me.  I joined the church in the spring  of 1888 in Georgia, and shortly  afterward I sold out my home  and came to Utah locating in  Ogden. I bought me a home here  but had not enough money to pay  for same, and through the hard  times I have not had sufficient  prosperity to pay off the debt, and  hence within the last month I have  had to relinquish the place, and  it has gone back to the orginal  owner, this leaves me without a  home and as I have seven children  and a wife in my family, most of  the children small, my circumstancs  are not very flattering however as I  have already stated, I am at your  servises if you require me and  I will leave the result with Him  whom I covenanted to obey. I desire  to be all that is implied in a  minute man.

 POSTMASTERS.    Be good enough to put this in the box of any widow  whose husband served in Mexico, Florida, or Creek Indian  Wars.    Pension Attorneys Attention.    Important to thousands of widows in all parts of the country.    In the January DAY STAR we shall commence the publication of the  names of all the officers that served in the Mexican war.

Land warrants who entitled all  who served 14 days in the Seminole Florida War, Black Hawk  War, Creek Indian War, South Western Arkansas Frontier dis-  turbances, War with Great Britain, Patriot War and Mexican  War, and in all cases where the Militia of any State or Territory  has been called out between June 12, 1812, and March 3, 1855,  and their services been paid, also those who served in the inva-  sion of Plattsburgh, September, 1814, the battle of Nico Jack, with  the savages.  Those who served in Mexico and California, and  against the Digger Indians in Oregon. And all who have been  engaged in a battle, or skirmish where life was in danger, though  they served but one minute, are entitled, if they have not already  received it, to 160 acres of land. If they have received 40 or 80  acres, they are entitled to enough more to make 160 acres. If  they have died without having received it, their widow or former  widow is entitled to it. Widows, who are such at the time they  apply, are entitled though they may have been married since the  husband for whose service thay apply, died.    LAND WARRANTS    Issued after the death of the soldier or widow named in them, can  be made available. We will buy them.    All who have informally assigned land warrants write the  facts, and name their price.    We can furnish evidence of service in most cases.    Having had an experience of about 40 years in the business  at Detroit, Mich., and Cleveland, Ohio, about eight million acres  of land warrants and scrip having passed through our hands, the  numbers, dates, etc., having been preserved; also having a large  number of rolls, we can furnish evidence of service in most cases.  Attorneys have many good cases for pensions and bounty land  suspended for evidence of service. Our fees for furnishing evi-  dence is $10. If we fail to furnish the evidence required, the  money will in all cases be returned. No cure, no pay. Our fees for  obtaining pensions and land warrants is $25.    Address    G. F.

 Copy of letter    Laie. Aug. 23rd 1888    Pres. Wilford Woodruff:    There is a matter which  I wish to lay before you, and upon which I desire  your counsel and decision. Perhaps a brief out-  line or history of the subject will be as fitting an  introduction as any I might choose.    Sometime last winter, in Jan. I beleive, my hus-  band and I were discussing the future as it re-  lated to my literary labors and aspirations. I had  been making an effort to introduce some of  my articles in the Eastern magazines with the  hope that in a quiet and humble way I might  introduce place before the great reading public  of America the real facts of the Mormon case,  more especially in regard to women and the  great priviledges which they enjoy under the  gosple plan. In remarking upon the future  possibilities of my plan, Jacob said to me  that it would please him to see my whole time  and labors ^now spent in^ literary efforts in various directions 
 I personally superintend their placing without  charge. I would like to furnish one  for the remains of your distinguished  predecessor the cost of them varies  according to their weight.

 Portland, Oregon.  June 15th, 1888.    President Wilford Woodruff,  Salt Lake City, Utah.    Dear Brother Woodruff:    Your letter of the 8th inst.  was duly rec'd. I am very much obliged  to you for your trouble in sending the  account of the meeting of the Board on  Education.    In answering your enquiry whether or  not it would be convenient for me to  come to Salt Lake, in case you desired  to hold an important meeting, I would  say that it will not be practicable  for me to go, until about November next.  Major Jones, who has charge of a part  of the Government improvements in Oregon  and Washington T[erritor]y., has been granted a leave  of absence for four months, beginning  June 20th, and his works are all to be  in my charge during his absence.    We are expecting the new River & Harbor  bill to pass very soon now, and as  soon as it does, I will be very busy 
 all round to older heads, as it has been openly  expressed even by some Bishops and leading   men. And this partly is one reason why I take  up the subject. I may say I have gone through  the Book of Mormon twenty times to find out the  Ge-o-graphical part of it. And I doubt the  ab^i^lity of any man to get up a map and locate  a city as its proper site. I have seen ^two^ maps  gotten up and if my memery serves me right the  two maps disagree. And further more the two  maps disagree with the Book of Mormon its self  for enstance if the city Jashon is placed on the map  and located in south America, and the Book lo-  cate it in North america, which is dos, these  two do not agree. Again if Moroni's line of  defence is placed on a map and located in  south America, running from a given point  nearly a north and south direction where it  would take a Nephite many days to cross it.  And the book say it was a days journey for  a nephite to cross it, from sea to sea, there is  a dis agreement, and the book say so. Now 
 centered in some place where I would do good to my  sisters and at the same time center my efforts.    He further added that he should like to see me  associated with Sister E. B. Wells in the labors of the  Exponent publication. This was a very novel  idea to me, as in all my hopes and aims for the  future, no idea ^had ever occurred to me^ of actual partccipation in the  editing of publishing of a paper or magazine.  But the more I studied over the matter the more it  seemed to open up before me. I had intended ^wished & hoped^ to use  my talents ^to do good;^ or as Aunt Eliza Snow once affection-  ately remarked to me, "never write a line or a  word that is not calculated to help and benefit  this Kingdom. But Heretofore however my aims  were all individual ones; now a new thought  was precented. At length I acted upon the  suggestion of my husband, and by his advice  addressed a private letter to Sister Romnaina  B. Pratt who was an old and valued friend, and  one who was conversant with matters pertain-  ing to the interests of the R.S. and its organ  the Exponent. These things were The wish of  my husband was stated, and a number of questions  asked in relation to the Board and Management  of the Exponent, and the possibilities as to the con-

Dear Sister:    In a favor which I have received   from you, under date of the 24th. inst., you ask,    "First: Are sisters justified in administer-  ing the ordinance of washing and anointing previous  to confinements to those who have received their en-  dowments and have married men outside of the   Church?"    "Second: Can anyone who has not had  their endowments be thus administered to by the  sisters if she is a faithful saint in good standing  and has not yet had the opportunity of going to 
 in [innagurating] and supervising work  in the different districts.  After work  is well started, I could get away, but  this will not be till fall. If the  River & Harbor bill does not become a law,  or if Major Jones should give up his  leave, I could go at any time.    I should have about 20 days notice of an  expected meeting, in order to enable me  to get a leave in regular form. If  this should not be practicable I might,  possibly, start after one or two days notice, by  using the telegraph, or by granting myself  a weeks leave, which, under my present  duties, I am permitted to do.    Regarding the plot of ground in the  18th Ward, held by the Board of Trustees of  the Young Academy of Salt Lake, I would  say that, as a member of the Board, and as  an heir, I would be glad to have it  utalized by the Board of Education, if it  is possible. Brother LeGrand Young can best  tell whether or not it will be possible.    With best wishes,  Your Brother,  W. Young

 the water of Mormon I dear not say much  about it. But with my close study I could  never place it in south America, from the  fact, the condition as a wooded thicket as Alma  found it as a resort to preach and baptize in  in his day. And the condition as found,  280 years a go by two Franciscon Monks I  am enduced to believe it to be located in what  is now known as Guatimala. Alma says it  was a place of pure water. the above Monks  in 1608 went to preach to the indians that dwelt  on an island in a very large Lake in Guatima-  la and the indians sent them a way saying the  time had not come for them to receive christianity  And in after years the Spanish soldiers had  to cut their way to this beautifull place of water  and with their guns frighted the natives they took  to the water and escaped to lands unknown, and  the Monks with the soldies sent a shout of victory to the  heavens and thanked God they had gained an island  with out an inhabitant. Now my next poit  is one that I am a little timmid on as it 
 sent and approval of the ^R.S.^ Authorities, and as to the  possibility of Sister Wells admitting me as a partner  in the Exponent. It will be needless to relate any thing  further of my desires in this direction, as I wish to  come at once to the answer I received from Dr.  Pratt in ^this lo^ June. She apologises for her long delay  and assures me that she has thought often upon my  letter. Answering in part my questions, she discour-  ages the plan of my attempting to get upon the Ex-  ponent, her reasons for which I will copy in her  own words: "But I suggest x x &c (copy letter to—)  I have mentioned it to no one concerning you."    Here then was an entirely new suggestion. Upon  reflection, my husband decided that if the Pres-  idency of the Church, and the Authorities of & Members  of the Y.L.M.I.A. felt to add thier co-operation  and faith to such a scheme, he was willing I  should undertake to fulfill a portion of that  mission. Accordingly, I wrote a letter setting  these matters forth to one who has been a friend  and a brother to us, and whose counsel upon the  matter would be dictated by the Spirit of the  Lord, that brother was Pres Joseph F. Smith.  We have just received his reply in which he  refers us to yourself for counsel adding that  the "he is favorable to such an enterprize as is 
 A. B. Thomas,  APIARIST  Spring Lake, Utah Jan 9th 1893  P.O. Box, L  Payson, U.T    President Wilford Woodruff  Salt Lake City Utah    Dear Brother.  In response to the call that is made  on me by you to be in Salt Lake  March 3rd next ready for a mission to  the Southern States. Will say, that  I am willing to go. I will say however  that I am not prepared financially and  that I so stated my condition to the  brethren here before my name was sent  up as a prospective missionary.    My family can support themselves I think  but I have no money, nor no property  that I can sell. Except bees and I  don't think I could sell them as the  honey season was so poor last year  So the bee men are rather discouraged.  I will say again in conclusion  that if the way is opened up financially  that I want to go on that mission.  Your Brother in the gospel    A. B. Thomas    Jonathan S. Page Jr.  Bishop Payson Second  Ward    I would extend           his time until               he can raise the           means to go with                                   J. F. S. 
 the Temple for the ordinances?"    To begin with I desire to say that the   ordinance of washing and anointing is one that should   only be administered in Temples or other holy places   which are dedicated for the purpose of giving endow-  ments to the Saints. That ordinance ought not to be  administered to any one, whether she has received or   has not received her endowments, in any other place   or under any other circumstances.    But I imagine from your question   that you refer to a practice that has grown up among   the sisters of washing and anointing sisters who are   approaching their confinement. If so, this is not,   strictly speaking, an ordinance, unless it be done   under the direction of the priesthood and in con-  nection with the ordinance of laying on of hands   for the restoration of the sick.    There is no impropriety in sisters   washing and anointing their sisters in this way, under   the circumstances you describe; but it should be

 Y, APRIL 10, 1887--SIX    PISGAH BURYING GROUND.    For the Preservation of a Sacred  Historical Spot.    To the Editor of THE HERALD    Over two years ago, President John  Taylor received a letter from a gentle-  man owning the land at Pisgah, Iowa,  where three hundred of the Saints were  buried, in their exodus from Nauvoo to  these mountains.  The gentleman. Mr.  A. E. White, stated to President Taylor  that he had never suffered the land to  be plowed or disturbed, known there as  the "old Mormon Burying Ground,"  and he wanted to know what the people  here in Utah, who had friends buried  there, wanted to do about the ground  or the remains of their friends.  In his   letter, he made mention of the name of  William Huntington, my father, as  having been buried there, who was a  Bishop or presiding officer of the settle-  ment.    President Taylor sent Mr. White's  letter to me with instructions what to do  in the matter.  I have followed his in-  structions, and to-day, through the  blessings of God, and the kindness and  humanity of Mr. White, the "Old Mor-  mon Burying Ground" belongs to the  Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day  Saints.  The lot of one acre is fenced  with a good wire-netting fence, and this  spring there will be a row of poplar  trees set around the lot inside the  fence.    It is now desired by many, in order to  fully complete improvements upon the  ground, that a monument of some kind,  or a stone, should be placed in the  center of the lot, whereon shall be en-  graved the names of all persons buried  there, so far as can be obtained.  This  work will necessarily require money,  which should be forwarded to me at  Springville, Utah, as soon as possible,  and I will forward the same to Mr.  White, who has very kindly and  gratuitously attended to all business  matters pertaining to the ground which  lies in the center of his farm.    The liberality of those interested in  this matter will decide the kind and  respectability of the object that will  indicate the last resting place of their  loved ones.    Will every person having relatives  buried there forward the names of the   dead without delay, and as liberal  donations as their circumstances will  permit?  Every one should send as   much as will pay for engraving the  names of their dead at least, and they  that are well-to-do should send more,  that the good work may be completed  in a creditable manner.    When fully completed, a photograph  of the ground will be sent to those most   liberal in donating.    OLIVER B. HUNTINGTON.  SPRINGVILLE, Utah Co., Utah,  March 30, 1887.

 understood that they do this, not as members of the   priesthood, but as members of the Church, exercising   faith for, and asking the blessings of the Lord upon,   their sisters; just as they, and every member of the   Church, might do in behalf of the members of their   families.    In all these matters, however, care should   be taken that wrong ideas be not imbibed and   wrong practices be not adopted connected with ordinances   of the Gospel.    In reply, therefore, to your two questions,   answering you in the above light, I think you are   quite justified in doing anything that you can for   the benefit of the sisters who are in that condition,   who may apply to you, even though they should   be married to men outside of the Church; and certainly,   as your second question implies, there should be no hesi-  tation about administering to faithful sisters in good   standing, though they may not have had the oppor-

 tunity of receiving their endowments, any more than   there would be were they to apply to have hands laid   upon them by an Elder to rebuke sickness.    As to your third question, "Is it the   proper thing for a sister to preside over a Relief So-  ciety who has not yet received her endowments?" I would   naturally suppose that such a person would be rarely,   if ever, called to preside over a Relief Society; because   a woman who would be qualified for this, if married,   would certainly honor the ordinances of the Lord's house   sufficiently to have her marriage solemnized in the   Temple, and she could not have this done without   receiving her endowments. Other cases, where a person   would not have had her endowments, would be that of   an unmarried woman, who, I suppose, is rarely called   to preside over a Relief Society.    I trust that what I have said on   these points will be quite satisfactory to you and   will give you the needed information.    I am, with kind regards, Your Brother, W Woodruff

 This is a correct copy of the original   which Sister Wells has deposited in   our office.    Mar. 7th, 1906. (Signed) Joseph F. Smith.    Salt Lake City, Utah. April 27th, 1888.    Mrs. Emmeline B. Wells,    Editor "Woman's Exponent."    Dear Sister,    In a favor which havre received from you, under date of the 24th.   inst., you ask,    "First: Are sisters justified in miniestering the ordinacnce of   washing and annointing previous to confinements to those who have   received their endowments and have married men outside of the Church?"    "Second, Can anyone who has not had their endowments be thus   administered to by the sisters if she is a faithful saint in good   standing and has not yet had the opportunity of going to the Temple   for the ordinance?"    To begin with I desire to say that the ordinance of washing and   annointing is one that should only be administered in the Temple or   other holy places which are dedicated for the purpose of giving en-  dowments to the [S]aints. That ordinance ought not to be administered   to any one, whetehrer she has received or has not received her endowments,   in any other place or under any other circumstances.    But I imagine from your question that you refer to a practise   that has grown up amoung the sisters of washing and annointing sisters   who are approaching their confinement. If so, this is not, strictly   speaking, an ordinance, unless it be done under the direction of the   priesthood and in connection with the ordinance of laying on of h[a]nds   for the restoration of the sick.    There is no impropriety in sisters washing and annointing their   sister[s] in this way, under the circumstances you describe; but it sho-  uld understood that they do this, not as members of the priesthood,   but as members of the Church, exercising faith for, and asking the   blessings of the Lord upon, their sisters; just as they, and every   member of the Church might do in behalf of the members of their   families.

 Coalville. Jan. 3rd. 1893.    Pres. Wilford. Woodruff  Dear Brother:    Your letter of Dec. 28th informing  me that my name has been suggested and accept  ed as a Missionary to Great Britain, and desiring  to know my feelings in relation to the call was  received.    I fully appreciate the responsibility which rests  upon an Elder called as a Missionary by the servants  of God, and I have given the matter much consid-  eration and study, and have considered my cir-  cumstances financial and otherwise, and the  result of my deliberations is that it is my duty  to accept the call.    I therefore accept the call and will have my  arrangements completed to start from Salt Lake City  for Great Britain on the date named in your letter  April 12th 1893.    Your Brother in the Gospel    Chas. Callis    I take pleasure in recommending  Bro Callis, as being worth of any position    You may call him to.  Your Bro.  George Beard Bp C.S.W.    See over

 In all these matters, however, care should be taken that wrong   ide[a]s be not imbibed and wrong practises be not adopted connected with   ordinances of the Gospel.    In reply, therefore, to your two questions, answering you in   the above light, I think you are quite justified in doing anything   you can for the benefit of the sisters who are in that condition, who   may apply to you, even though they should be married to men outside   of the Church; and certainly, as your second question implies, there   should be no hesitation about administering to faithful sisters in good   standing, though they may not of had the opportunity of receiving   their endowmnents, any more than there would be were they to apply to   have hands laid upon them by an elder to rebuke sickness.    As to your third question, "Is it the proper thing for a sister   to preside over a Relief Society who has not yet received her endow-  ments?" I would naturally suppose that such a person would be rarely,   if ever called to preside over a Relief Society, because a woman who   would be quaolified for this, if married, would certainly honor the   ordinarnce of the Lord's House sufficiently to have her marriage   solemnised in the Temple, and she could not have this done without   receiving her endowments. Other cases whrere a person would not have   had her endowments, would be that of an umnmarried woman, who, I   suppose, is rarely called to preside over a Relief Society.    I trust that what I have said on these points will be quite   satisfactory to you and will give you the needed information.    I am, with kind regards,    Your Brother,    (Signed,) W. Woodruff.

In truth my lord I had a stormy life; I married in the year 1855, February 13th,  and she died in Buenos Aires on November 5, 1888, of heart sickness.  We loved each other very much, we raised 10 children, 8 boys, 2 girls,   2 are dead, 8 are still alive, all are fine, and [make some money].    I live with my first born Cesare Giovanni, married.    I have always loved my co-religionist, helping them with their needs, when they would let me know speaking together, and for such    I had to suffer many vicissitudes due to my children

 Salt Lake City Oct 29th 1892    President Wilford Woodruff,    Dear Brother    I beg to acknowledge receipt of your  letter informing me that I have been selected to   go on a mission to the Southern States.    I unsesitatingly accept the honor thus confered  upon me, trusting that my lack of ability to properly   discharge the important duties of a missionary may   be made up by God's blessing.    I think it is advisable to inform you that the   office I at present hold is that of a Teacher. I state   this because I believe it is usual for missionaries   to be appointed from higher quorums in the preist-  hood. However, I shall be prepared to be set apart and  start for my field of labor at the designated time.    Your humble brother  Geo. L. McAllister    John Tingey  Bp 17th Ward    All right.

 2    of Elders going this   month; do you wish me to go with them,  or when?    Dear Brother Woodruff,  if I stay at home,  there is all probability  that I might be ar-  rested ^again^ any day, and  I would be very thank-  ful to you, if you kindly  just tell me your  opinion and advice, as  I am, and trust always  will be willing to abide  by your counsel. I  would not like to go  on a Mission, unless  called by the Servants  of God, but if you,  dear Brother tell me 
 who live in Buenos Aires, 4 boys and two married girls,   one with one Baggiano Jose Fabbrica of [Fideasi] and   the other with one Domingo Quadrio, head of the railway station   in Bernal, that for helping them I almost lost all my money.    After the death of my poor wife, good and   virtuous mother, the adverse fortune continues  persecuting me until today, such that I had   to abandon Italy again, ungrateful homeland, to the men   that live in Sestri Levante, where I had been called by   a son of mine, who, when I arrived there, robbed me,   betraying and ruining me, a real heartless son, who cost me   double all my other children, and he even denied  the food from my little [nieces and] nephew 4 girls and one boy, children of   my first born Cesare: he called us from America after   5 years, and when we arrived he denied us the reimbursement of the   Colombo Hotel, to him with my wife we had come   with the agreement that he would have reimbursed us in case of returning or call,   returning the paid capital, and so he left us in the street!!  The heartless person had written to us again, saying that he would have  helped us; we came, we saw, and we found everything the opposite,   everything to the contrary, such a traitor. 
 I thought the matter over  considerable and finally  decided to accept it but have  regretted it since, as I do  not wish to shrink any  duties of a Latterday Saint  and our Band has quite a   number of Elders who are  worthy to go on a mission  two of whom have had  their names sent down a   few days ago, one of them  being my Brother John Done Jr  I do not wish to ask for a   Mission but having once been  called and released before  going.

Dier Brother,    I recieved your Call for a Mission to the  Northern States and in reply will say: That I  feel like going if in some shape or other I can get  off. I have been called before and honurable released  It was ^called^ to Swiztzerland and Germany befor and non  to the Northern States which suits me better on acount  of it not taken so much money in my Opinion.    I am a poor man with two Wifes and 5 Childern  and iabout 350 Dollars in debt. I have Stock and horses  to cover my debts 2 or 3 times over, but wether I can  fix everything satiesfactory befor that time I cannot  say yet. with the Lords help I might do more that  what looks hardly possible.    I owe Z. C. M. I. Logan $112.00 Cash. Oct 1st1893.  I owe Mrs Schettler Logan 10000 Cash Mar 26, 1893  I owe to John Bauman for wintering  27 head of yearling Heifers about 9000.  besides other small debt that I will not mention.    I opened up a New Restaurant here in Logan  with the above bowrowed money ^and Credit^ and I am doing  a fair Business, but I am trying to sell out and  settle up everything and go on my Mission unless  you advise me otherwise.    I feel a though I would not like to miss this chance  and if it should be impossible for me to sell something 
 We found ourselves in a dire situation, and having used all the little money   we took to America from Italy, in various quarrels   against that rascal to obtain a justice never found,   we thought of migrating again to America to New York, where   we are since a year ago, abandoning so our ungrateful homeland   with all that live there…    My children in Buenos aires wrote [asking] that we visit them,   all together with my brother, his wife and family: we replied no,   preferring to stay away from everybody, that if they wanted to help   their Beloved Parents thay could send something, that we would accept very gratefully . . . . they did not reply ever again, God forgive them!    Now, in name of God and Jesus Christ and of the Saint Church of the   Latter Days Saints, I pray the kindness of you   sir, most excellent, if you could give me an aid,   I ask this as a gift and charity after 40 years on the next 3 of March,   that I belong to the Mormon Religion.    I ask this, my most excellent sir, because I find myself without any job,   reduced to be a cook, a good profession, but   because I do not understand the English language, I am not accepted in any place   this is such a sad situation for me with my 59 years!
