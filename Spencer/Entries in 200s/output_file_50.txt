 Portland, Oregon.June 15th, 1888.President Wilford Woodruff,Salt Lake City, Utah.Dear Brother Woodruff:Your letter of the 8th inst.was duly rec'd. I am very much obligedto you for your trouble in sending theaccount of the meeting of the Board onEducation.In answering your enquiry whether ornot it would be convenient for me tocome to Salt Lake, in case you desiredto hold an important meeting, I wouldsay that it will not be practicablefor me to go, until about November next.Major Jones, who has charge of a partof the Government improvements in Oregonand Washington T[erritor]y., has been granted a leaveof absence for four months, beginningJune 20th, and his works are all to bein my charge during his absence.We are expecting the new River & Harborbill to pass very soon now, and assoon as it does, I will be very busy 
 all round to older heads, as it has been openlyexpressed even by some Bishops and leading men. And this partly is one reason why I takeup the subject. I may say I have gone throughthe Book of Mormon twenty times to find out theGe-o-graphical part of it. And I doubt theab^i^lity of any man to get up a map and locatea city as its proper site. I have seen ^two^ mapsgotten up and if my memery serves me right thetwo maps disagree. And further more the twomaps disagree with the Book of Mormon its selffor enstance if the city Jashon is placed on the mapand located in south America, and the Book lo-cate it in North america, which is dos, thesetwo do not agree. Again if Moroni's line ofdefence is placed on a map and located insouth America, running from a given pointnearly a north and south direction where itwould take a Nephite many days to cross it.And the book say it was a days journey fora nephite to cross it, from sea to sea, there isa dis agreement, and the book say so. Now 
 centered in some place where I would do good to mysisters and at the same time center my efforts.He further added that he should like to see meassociated with Sister E. B. Wells in the labors of theExponent publication. This was a very novelidea to me, as in all my hopes and aims for thefuture, no idea ^had ever occurred to me^ of actual partccipation in theediting of publishing of a paper or magazine.But the more I studied over the matter the more itseemed to open up before me. I had intended ^wished & hoped^ to usemy talents ^to do good;^ or as Aunt Eliza Snow once affection-ately remarked to me, "never write a line or aword that is not calculated to help and benefitthis Kingdom. But Heretofore however my aimswere all individual ones; now a new thoughtwas precented. At length I acted upon thesuggestion of my husband, and by his adviceaddressed a private letter to Sister RomnainaB. Pratt who was an old and valued friend, andone who was conversant with matters pertain-ing to the interests of the R.S. and its organthe Exponent. These things were The wish ofmy husband was stated, and a number of questionsasked in relation to the Board and Managementof the Exponent, and the possibilities as to the con-

Ifthis should not be practicable I might,possibly, start after one or two days notice, byusing the telegraph, or by granting myselfa weeks leave, which, under my presentduties, I am permitted to do.Regarding the plot of ground in the18th Ward, held by the Board of Trustees ofthe Young Academy of Salt Lake, I wouldsay that, as a member of the Board, and asan heir, I would be glad to have itutalized by the Board of Education, if itis possible.

 the water of Mormon I dear not say muchabout it. But with my close study I couldnever place it in south America, from thefact, the condition as a wooded thicket as Almafound it as a resort to preach and baptize inin his day. And the condition as found,280 years a go by two Franciscon Monks Iam enduced to believe it to be located in whatis now known as Guatimala. Alma says itwas a place of pure water. the above Monksin 1608 went to preach to the indians that dwelton an island in a very large Lake in Guatima-la and the indians sent them a way saying thetime had not come for them to receive christianityAnd in after years the Spanish soldiers hadto cut their way to this beautifull place of waterand with their guns frighted the natives they tookto the water and escaped to lands unknown, andthe Monks with the soldies sent a shout of victory to theheavens and thanked God they had gained an islandwith out an inhabitant. Now my next poitis one that I am a little timmid on as it 
 sent and approval of the ^R.S.^ Authorities, and as to thepossibility of Sister Wells admitting me as a partnerin the Exponent. It will be needless to relate any thingfurther of my desires in this direction, as I wish tocome at once to the answer I received from Dr.Pratt in ^this lo^ June. She apologises for her long delayand assures me that she has thought often upon myletter. Answering in part my questions, she discour-ages the plan of my attempting to get upon the Ex-ponent, her reasons for which I will copy in herown words: "But I suggest x x &c (copy letter to—)I have mentioned it to no one concerning you."Here then was an entirely new suggestion. Uponreflection, my husband decided that if the Pres-idency of the Church, and the Authorities of & Membersof the Y.L.M.I.A. felt to add thier co-operationand faith to such a scheme, he was willing Ishould undertake to fulfill a portion of thatmission. Accordingly, I wrote a letter settingthese matters forth to one who has been a friendand a brother to us, and whose counsel upon thematter would be dictated by the Spirit of theLord, that brother was Pres Joseph F. Smith.We have just received his reply in which herefers us to yourself for counsel adding thatthe "he is favorable to such an enterprize as is

 the Temple for the ordinances?"To begin with I desire to say that the ordinance of washing and anointing is one that should only be administered in Temples or other holy places which are dedicated for the purpose of giving endow-ments to the Saints. That ordinance ought not to beadministered to any one, whether she has received or has not received her endowments, in any other place or under any other circumstances.But I imagine from your question that you refer to a practice that has grown up among the sisters of washing and anointing sisters who are approaching their confinement. If so, this is not, strictly speaking, an ordinance, unless it be done under the direction of the priesthood and in con-nection with the ordinance of laying on of hands for the restoration of the sick.There is no impropriety in sisters washing and anointing their sisters in this way, under the circumstances you describe; but it should be

 Y, APRIL 10, 1887--SIXPISGAH BURYING GROUND.For the Preservation of a SacredHistorical Spot.To the Editor of THE HERALDOver two years ago, President JohnTaylor received a letter from a gentle-man owning the land at Pisgah, Iowa,where three hundred of the Saints wereburied, in their exodus from Nauvoo tothese mountains.  The gentleman. Mr.A. E. White, stated to President Taylorthat he had never suffered the land tobe plowed or disturbed, known there asthe "old Mormon Burying Ground,"and he wanted to know what the peoplehere in Utah, who had friends buriedthere, wanted to do about the groundor the remains of their friends.  In his letter, he made mention of the name ofWilliam Huntington, my father, ashaving been buried there, who was aBishop or presiding officer of the settle-ment.President Taylor sent Mr. White'sletter to me with instructions what to doin the matter.  I have followed his in-structions, and to-day, through theblessings of God, and the kindness andhumanity of Mr. White, the "Old Mor-mon Burying Ground" belongs to theChurch of Jesus Christ of Latter-daySaints.  The lot of one acre is fencedwith a good wire-netting fence, and thisspring there will be a row of poplartrees set around the lot inside thefence.It is now desired by many, in order tofully complete improvements upon theground, that a monument of some kind,or a stone, should be placed in thecenter of the lot, whereon shall be en-graved the names of all persons buriedthere, so far as can be obtained.  Thiswork will necessarily require money,which should be forwarded to me atSpringville, Utah, as soon as possible,and I will forward the same to Mr.White, who has very kindly andgratuitously attended to all businessmatters pertaining to the ground whichlies in the center of his farm.The liberality of those interested inthis matter will decide the kind andrespectability of the object that willindicate the last resting place of theirloved ones.Will every person having relativesburied there forward the names of the dead without delay, and as liberaldonations as their circumstances willpermit?  Every one should send as much as will pay for engraving thenames of their dead at least, and theythat are well-to-do should send more,that the good work may be completedin a creditable manner.When fully completed, a photographof the ground will be sent to those most liberal in donating.OLIVER B.

 understood that they do this, not as members of the priesthood, but as members of the Church, exercising faith for, and asking the blessings of the Lord upon, their sisters; just as they, and every member of the Church, might do in behalf of the members of their families.In all these matters, however, care should be taken that wrong ideas be not imbibed and wrong practices be not adopted connected with ordinances of the Gospel.In reply, therefore, to your two questions, answering you in the above light, I think you are quite justified in doing anything that you can for the benefit of the sisters who are in that condition, who may apply to you, even though they should be married to men outside of the Church; and certainly, as your second question implies, there should be no hesi-tation about administering to faithful sisters in good standing, though they may not have had the oppor-

 tunity of receiving their endowments, any more than there would be were they to apply to have hands laid upon them by an Elder to rebuke sickness.As to your third question, "Is it the proper thing for a sister to preside over a Relief So-ciety who has not yet received her endowments?" I would naturally suppose that such a person would be rarely, if ever, called to preside over a Relief Society; because a woman who would be qualified for this, if married, would certainly honor the ordinances of the Lord's house sufficiently to have her marriage solemnized in the Temple, and she could not have this done without receiving her endowments. Other cases, where a person would not have had her endowments, would be that of an unmarried woman, who, I suppose, is rarely called to preside over a Relief Society.I trust that what I have said on these points will be quite satisfactory to you and will give you the needed information.I am, with kind regards, Your Brother, W Woodruff

 This is a correct copy of the original which Sister Wells has deposited in our office.Mar. 7th, 1906. (Signed) Joseph F. Smith.Salt Lake City, Utah. April 27th, 1888.Mrs. Emmeline B. Wells,Editor "Woman's Exponent."Dear Sister,In a favor which havre received from you, under date of the 24th. inst., you ask,"First: Are sisters justified in miniestering the ordinacnce of washing and annointing previous to confinements to those who have received their endowments and have married men outside of the Church?""Second, Can anyone who has not had their endowments be thus administered to by the sisters if she is a faithful saint in good standing and has not yet had the opportunity of going to the Temple for the ordinance?"To begin with I desire to say that the ordinance of washing and annointing is one that should only be administered in the Temple or other holy places which are dedicated for the purpose of giving en-dowments to the [S]aints. That ordinance ought not to be administered to any one, whetehrer she has received or has not received her endowments, in any other place or under any other circumstances.But I imagine from your question that you refer to a practise that has grown up amoung the sisters of washing and annointing sisters who are approaching their confinement. If so, this is not, strictly speaking, an ordinance, unless it be done under the direction of the priesthood and in connection with the ordinance of laying on of h[a]nds for the restoration of the sick.There is no impropriety in sisters washing and annointing their sister[s] in this way, under the circumstances you describe; but it sho-uld understood that they do this, not as members of the priesthood, but as members of the Church, exercising faith for, and asking the blessings of the Lord upon, their sisters; just as they, and every member of the Church might do in behalf of the members of their families.

 Salt Lake City Oct 29th 1892President Wilford Woodruff,Dear BrotherI beg to acknowledge receipt of yourletter informing me that I have been selected to go on a mission to the Southern States.I unsesitatingly accept the honor thus conferedupon me, trusting that my lack of ability to properly discharge the important duties of a missionary may be made up by God's blessing.I think it is advisable to inform you that the office I at present hold is that of a Teacher. I state this because I believe it is usual for missionaries to be appointed from higher quorums in the preist-hood. However, I shall be prepared to be set apart andstart for my field of labor at the designated time.Your humble brotherGeo. L. McAllisterJohn TingeyBp 17th WardAll right.

Iwould not like to goon a Mission, unlesscalled by the Servantsof God, but if you,dear Brother tell me 
 who live in Buenos Aires, 4 boys and two married girls, one with one Baggiano Jose Fabbrica of [Fideasi] and the other with one Domingo Quadrio, head of the railway station in Bernal, that for helping them I almost lost all my money.After the death of my poor wife, good and virtuous mother, the adverse fortune continuespersecuting me until today, such that I had to abandon Italy again, ungrateful homeland, to the men that live in Sestri Levante, where I had been called by a son of mine, who, when I arrived there, robbed me, betraying and ruining me, a real heartless son, who cost me double all my other children, and he even deniedthe food from my little [nieces and] nephew 4 girls and one boy, children of my first born Cesare: he called us from America after 5 years, and when we arrived he denied us the reimbursement of the Colombo Hotel, to him with my wife we had come with the agreement that he would have reimbursed us in case of returning or call, returning the paid capital, and so he left us in the street!!The heartless person had written to us again, saying that he would havehelped us; we came, we saw, and we found everything the opposite, everything to the contrary, such a traitor. 
 I thought the matter overconsiderable and finallydecided to accept it but haveregretted it since, as I donot wish to shrink anyduties of a Latterday Saintand our Band has quite a number of Elders who areworthy to go on a missiontwo of whom have hadtheir names sent down a few days ago, one of thembeing my Brother John Done JrI do not wish to ask for a Mission but having once beencalled and released beforegoing.

 We found ourselves in a dire situation, and having used all the little money we took to America from Italy, in various quarrels against that rascal to obtain a justice never found, we thought of migrating again to America to New York, where we are since a year ago, abandoning so our ungrateful homeland with all that live there…My children in Buenos aires wrote [asking] that we visit them, all together with my brother, his wife and family: we replied no, preferring to stay away from everybody, that if they wanted to help their Beloved Parents thay could send something, that we would accept very gratefully . . . . they did not reply ever again, God forgive them!Now, in name of God and Jesus Christ and of the Saint Church of the Latter Days Saints, I pray the kindness of you sir, most excellent, if you could give me an aid, I ask this as a gift and charity after 40 years on the next 3 of March, that I belong to the Mormon Religion.I ask this, my most excellent sir, because I find myself without any job, reduced to be a cook, a good profession, but because I do not understand the English language, I am not accepted in any place this is such a sad situation for me with my 59 years!
