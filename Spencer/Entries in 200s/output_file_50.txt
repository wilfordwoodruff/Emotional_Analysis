ENDENTRY character that we are establishing, not to permit these infamous state- ments—either made by design or through ignorance—to pass out among the people of this nation without a flat and emphatic contradiction. (Ap- plause.) We are enjoined by the spirit and letter of this revelation to say that these things are false; that they are untrue in every particular; and further, we should say to the people of the United States that we claim the right to be heard upon this subject; that we have been lied about long enough; that we have been misrepresented to our injury and with- out protest as long as we intend to be. I conclude my remarks with the  closing words of the resolution, "And may God defend the right," for I believe He will. (Prolonged applause and a chorus of voices: "Amen.")  The preamble and resolutions were unanimously adopted by the congre- gation raising the right hand and shouting "Aye."  Hon. John T. Caine read the following  DECLARATION BY THE FIRST PRESIDENCY OF THE CHURCH:  Concerning the official report of the Utah Commission made to the  Secretary of the Interior, in which they allege, "During the past year,  notwithstanding the 'manifesto,' reports have been received by the Com- mission of eighteen male persons who, with an equal number of females,  are believed to have entered into polygamous marriages during the year,"  we have to say it is utterly without foundation in truth. We repeat in  the most solemn manner the declaration made by President Wilford  Woodruff at our General Conference held last October, that there have  been no plural marriages solemnized during the period named.  Polygamy or plural marriage has not been taught, neither has there been  given permission to any person to enter into its practice, but on the con- trary, it has been strictly forbidden.

This motion was carried unanimously.  THE AUTHORITIES OF THE CHURCH were presented by presented by President George Q.

Rulliger Er würde wol Arbeiten aber ENDENTRY AN EXPLANATION TO THE PUBLIC  There have been many communica- tions of late in the newspapers concern- ing Colonel Isaac Trumbo and his af- fairs. Charges have been made, ema- nating from various sources, that there  has been some financial connection be- tween himself and the Church of Jesus  Christ of Latter-day Saints. It has been repeatedly stated in years past, and the story has been revived of late,  that Colonel Trumbo has had large amounts of money in his hands and  under his control belonging to the  Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day  Saints; that he has been its agent in the expenditure of funds for the ac- complishment of certain ends that were desired to be achieved.  We have remained silent upon this  subject. It is well known that from  time to time charges are made and  circulated concerning us and our af- fairs, which we deem it unnecessary  to notice. It would be occupying too  much of our time to be contradicting stories which are put in circulation by  one and another for their own purposes. This feeling has restrained us in the past in relation to Colonel Trumbo and  his connection with us and our affairs. But it seems to be proper now, and just to ourselves, as well as common justice  to him, that we should say something  in relation to the association that has existed between Colonel Isaac Trumbo  and ourselves as the representatives of  the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- day Saints.  First of all, we wish to state most  emphatically that Colonel Trumbo has  not had property of ours in his pos- session for such purposes as alleged.  He has neither been our financial agent,  nor had any control of our property.  We have not entrusted him with  amounts of money to expend for us for  any such purposes.  In the time of our deep distress, when bitterness and hatred were manifested  against us in almost every public  quarter, Colonel Isaac Trumbo came to  Utah, and showed interest, in our af- fairs. Some of his own relatives were  involved in cases that were then before the courts. One prominent connection of his was consigned to the peniten- tiary, on the common charge that was in vogue against so many prominent  Latter-day Saints. The colonel's sym- pathies, it seems, were aroused, at least in behalf of his kinsfolk. This caused him to take interest in the whole ques- tion; and this interest absorbed him to such an extent that he withdrew from  profitable business that he had at the time in San Francisco, and devoted  himself almost exclusively to the labor of correcting the false impressions which prevailed and to the enlistment  of the press in the correction of the  many falsehoods and aspersions which  were in circulation; and afterwards,  on a wider field, using his influence  with leading men of the nation. We may say here that Colonel Isaac Trum- bo is a man of extraordinary energy.  When he undertakes anything that he thinks ought to be done, he is untiring in his efforts to accomplish it. These  characteristics were wonderfully illus- trated in the labors which he took upon  himself in behalf of the maligned and misrepresented Latter-day Saints. Be- ing a man of means, he was able to  travel from place to place, and especial- ly to visit and sustain himself at  Washington. We can never forget his  activity in visiting editors and using  his influence to correct public  opinion through the press. No  man could have displayed great- er zeal and disinterestedness than  he did in the labors that he took upon  himself. We felt that he was inspired; for, not being a member of our religious  organization, and having no financial  ends to accomplish that would be re- munerative to him, there was nothing to incite him to these extraordinary ex- ertions except a purely philanthropic  desire to defend an oppressed and un- popular people and to roll back the tide  of calumny and evil that threatened to overwhelm them. We felt thankful many times for the kind Providence  which raised him up; for he seemed to come to our aid at a time when a man in his position and with his indefatiga- ble energy was especially needed.  When the Mormon people were  threatened with disfranchisement, Col. Trumbo spent considerable time in  Washington, exerting himself to the  utmost of his ability to defeat that in- famous measure. And while there were other agencies also at work (for every- one that had any influence in the com- munity realized how necessary it was  that this measure should be defeated), still Colonel Isaac Trumbo was the  means of bringing powerful influences  to bear against the enactment of that  villainous bill. In the defeat of that  proposed legislation every member of  our Church had cause to be deeply grateful to the Lord and to the instru- ments which, under Him, were the  means of bringing it to naught.  With the same zeal and devotedness  he worked untiringly to obtain the am- nesty; and also afterwards in securing  the return of the personal property to the Church, and in preparing the way  for the return of the real estate.  He threw himself into the accom- plishment of all these ends with an  energy and wholeness of soul that won  him many friends and crowned his  labors and the labors of those who worked with him with success.  Colonel Trumbo was most fortun- ate in winning the respect and  admiration of influential men in the na- tion. By his representations of the con- dition of things in the then Territory of  Utah and his enthusiastic defense of  the Mormon people, he aroused the ac- tive interest and sympathies of very many of them. This was notably the  case with General James S. Clarkson.  This gentleman was deeply moved by  all that he learned, and he entered with  his whole soul and great influence, with  Colonel Trumbo, into the effort to make  the true character of the people known  to the nation and to remove the wide- spread and deeprooted prejudices which existed so generally at that time against the Mormon people. It would be invidious perhaps to attempt to give  names of other leading and influential  public men who, by the powerful ap- peals which were made to them, were  induced to examine what was known as the Mormon question from a dif- erent standpoint to that which they had  occupied; but their names are cherished in grateful remembrance by the men  of Utah, and their deeds will be pre- served in the history of the people. All  the influence which he had gained by  personal acquaintance Colonel Trumbo  used to make the people of Utah better known to the nation at large, and to wards preparing the way for the ad mission of Utah as a State. It is not necessary for us to go into details con cerning his labors in this direction; it  is sufficient to say that probably no sin- gle agency contributed so much to  making Utah a State as the labors of  Colonel Isaac Trumbo and his immedi- ate friends.
