 with Brother Snow and others. I had no conversation with him  They put up with Brother Snow, but I was informed they got  [to] church the friday night they came in, they were not able  to attend conference on Saturday. Brother Snow seems  to think with some caution I would be safe in Salt Lake  City, and He thought the Twelve felt the same. He seems to think  the Courts & Marshals here got so far along without the Church  records that they find they do not need them. That there  is no necessity of proving any marriage, as they seem to  have adopted Judge Howards views, that it requires very little  Law and Damn little testimony to convict a mormon.  I thought if the presidency had any views to communicate  to me about coming to S. L. C. I should be pleased to receive  them. Brother Snow will start in few days for S. L. and wished  me to go with him, but I felt Like waiting a short time  longer, as I have a chance to go in a waggon a week  after him I think probably it would not be well for  me to go by rail I am in the enjoyment of good health  and feel well in spirit. I feel that I can acknowledge  the hand of God in what is going on around us. The army worm  Canker worm, catapillar the lice, with all the plagues of Egypt  including the Judges & Marshals. I think the hand of the Lord  is in it Judgments & afflictions must begin at the hand of God  but the wicked will not escape. Our Nation must have a chance to  get ripe, and they are fast approaching the Harvest.

 Copy.  Department of the Interior  General Land Office Nov 13th 1879  Register and Receiver    Prescott Arizona    Gentlemen    I inclose herewith a copy of a letter from John L.  Harris Deputy W. S. Surveyor dated Tuscon  Arizona Ty 20th Ultimo in regard to trespass  on public timber in Trop. 17 N. R. 10 East  alleged to have been committed by William C.  McLellan Superintendant of a Saw Mill owned  by persons residing in Brigham City said  Territory. Mr Harris states that the timber  taken was hauled about 45 miles and used for  domestic purposes by the settlers along the  Little Colorado River in the vicinity of which  there is no building material. The time when  this trespass was committed, the amount and  value of the Timber taken is not stated by  Mr Harris. You are therefore directed to ascerta-  in and report these facts to this office. You  will notify the parties herein referred to, to cease  their depredations upon public timber and    should they desire to settle for the amount of  timber already taken you will require them as  a condition precedent thereto to submit to you a  full statement under oath, showing the time and  place where the trespass was committed, and the  quantity of timber cut and removed, which state-  ment you will forward to this office    Very Respectfully  Wm Armstrong  Acting Commissioner    Signed    Now Bro Taylor we want some counsel to  know what to do. Is this a Black-mail operation  or to get stumpage. We wish you to furnish us  correct information as to how the Law stands.  Has not the public a right to cut timber on the  public timber lands for domestic use? We have  cut no timber for any other purpose, and people are  cutting and sawing timber for domestic purposes  in all the Territories. Perhaps it would be well to  consult with Elias Smith. We would like an  answer immediately as we may have trouble on our

 Edmunds Tucker Bill is passed the House will   soon become a Law in some shape at least Enough   to take away all rights Gifted, Religious & politicals   from the Saints This apparently throws all our  interest in Houses, Lands, & property into the   hands of thieves & robbers and our own Liberties   & Lives sought by the same power The question   arises in my mind under these circumstan-  ces what duty requires me as an individual  to do, or what course to persue. My companion   E who has been with me some 3 Months  will soon return to her family, in fact she   is needed there as our Daughter who is   keeping house has been quite sick and she  cannot Leave the children or family permanetly  and if I have much dodging or distance of   travel I think I can do it alone better   than to have a part of my family with me  I have not as yet had any course marked  out which I have deciced to follow I have thought   when our Enemies grasp all the offices of the   Teritory and in a great measure will govern the   post offices that there would be No safety for   me in Utah and perhaps might be wisdom  for me to go to Arizona & probably on to Mexico   In that case could I have your consent for   Brothe Jack to furnish me on my Account some  $200 to assist me in my travels & living.

 We arrived at St Joseph on the evening of the 8th inst.  and on our arrival were informed that the youngest  wife of Bro Richards had a pair of twins—daughters.  one born 24 hours after the other, but they seemed  to think she was doing pretty well. I got hold of  the weekly news of Dec. 31st not having seen any news  for some 3 weeks I sat and read an hour and I  was asked to call in and see Sister Richards that   she had a poor spell, I walked into the room, I put  my hand on her head, I saw she was dying, I told  Bro. Richards he must give her up, in five min-  utes she breathed her last. She was 18 years old  her first children. In two hours after her youngest  child was dead. It was quite a loss to Bro Richards  and sudden.    We arrived at Sunset on the 9th  where I found a package of letters awaiting me among  them two from you of dade Dec 19th & 29th. Yours of  19th contained the letter of Bro. Perkins complaining  about his settlement at Sunset. He was here on busin-  ess when we got back I had him and Bro Lot Smith  together and the testimony given was that he did not

Brothers East & Green Made  a vary bad job last year by getting up  a petition with out any councel or sanction  from June N, or Lot Smith or any of the  Authorities to the Legislature to have this  county of Yavapai Divided there was but  very few of the Saints signed it and those that  did were Deceved in the Matter and when  it come to the Election the St John people  put in a ticket of Leonard Shanks and although  the Mormons had 2 votes to their one they voted  for the Dead & their horses & Dogs and got the  county seat at St Johns and elected their  own ticket and the commissioners are  Men that do not understand law & will run  the county in Debt all they can and are,  turning out all Mormon constables in their  own settlements where there is no gentils and Br.

I have been through the   Colorado Meadow it is from 10 to 15 Mils  long & 3 wide which is a level grass Meadow  Bottom there is No claims upon it except  Brs Green & Perkins have mad a location  upon it & one Mexican has taken one spring  The Brethren can take possession of that  county without cost Br Green thinks that  a good of Land outside of the Meadow can  be cultivated without Irrigatin for wheat corn  & vegitables.

 Sunset, Apache Co. Arizona Feb. 29 [18]80    President John Taylor    Dear brother:    Your letter of Feb. 20 has just come to hand  and before I recieved it I hade made my  calculations to go to St. John, Snowflake,  Round Valley and to visit the settlements with  brother John W. Young and to gather up all  the Tithing money of Arizona and start for  Utah the last of March via St. George and on to  Salt Lake, but your letter has changed my  course as I wish to attend the April Conference  which I would not have time to if I went east,  so I have made up my mind to start for St. George  on March 3rd.  Lot Smith will take me there.  Before I got your letter I had given instructions  to the bishops to sell what tithing wheat there was  to the people and it has nearly all been sold  for the money and it is doing as much good  as it would if it had been loaned or given away  for Lot Smith is supplying most that cannot  pay for flour or meal, and again we have doors  open to frieght flour from Albequirke and the

Instead of his working  all the time that he speaks of, he spent one whole  summer on a visit to Utah took his wife and family  and Lot Smith fitted him out with 4 yoke of large  fat beef cattle and wagon for he said he wanted to  bring some trees. He took the cattle to Silver Reef and  let them out to work until they were used up and  he never brought one yoke of them back to Sunset  one died on the road and all the rest were so used  up he left them by the wayside, and he borrowed  a team of Bp. Woodruff Freeman at the ferry and he  killed one of them on the road and the other was very  poor when he arrived and they had to send another  team from Sunset to get him back. Woodruff  Freeman is here and his mild opinion is that he is  one of the worst liars hypocrites he ever met with for  a Saint, as he had been in his ward for years at  Washington. he thinks Lot Smith done better by him  than he deserved, yet I have given him the privilege

 Great Salt Lake City December 16, 1850  Dear brother George    The copy of the ordinance to provide for the organization of Iron County was  forwarded to you by brother Aaron Farr which we have no doubt you have received 'ere this.    Your letter by brother Jackson Stewart was received yesterday evening,  and in reply to a question, if there were any further instructions for brother George, we say to  you, that if the weather should unfortunately set in very severe before you are enabled to reach  your destination, we would recommend to you, if you cannot get further than Salt Creek,  that we want a good settlement there; if you can get as far as Beaver Creek & should  get hemmed in with winter, we also want a good settlement there, and as soon as the  winter disappears you can then lead out for Iron County, to fulfil your present instructions.    Should you be hemmed in by Winter at either of the before mentioned  places it will be well for you to build a Fort, make yourselves secure,  & when you leave  in the Spring, leave from ten to twenty men in each or either Fort until more assistance  can reach them from this place. There is not the least fear, but that your cattle  will do well any where on the sides of the mountains, for feed is every where abundant  and fuel can be obtained in a very short distance from any point. The reason that  we are so very explicit is, that you may not hurry, or kill any of your cattle, but  preserve them and yourselves, and accomplish all the good you can. And may the God  of Israel bless and prosper you, in all that you put your hand to do, and that you  may return in safety to the bosom of your family & the society of those whom you love dear  in the Kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ.    Brigham Young    P.S. Please to make out a Schedule of your camp, and leave with James Pace at the Petiteneat to enable  me to take the census. 
 L. D. S. Historian's Office,    P. O. BOX 321,    Salt Lake City, Utah, Dec 5 1886    President John Taylor    Dear Brother    I received  your letter of Nov 26 with inclosure  from Sister Mary Jackson in Reply will  say there is most always two sides to most  questions I have looked upon Sister Mary  Jackson generally as a pretty good woman,  we did not have any difficulty or quarreling with  each other we were sealed at the time she  named I fitted out a waggon & team for  her and my Father and He drove the team to  Salt Lake in Brother Smoots Company the same  time you came to Salt Lake in the fall of  1847, she remainig in one of the rooms I  built in the old Fort untill I returned in  the fall of 1850. on my return I provided a  home for her and fed & clothed her as  the rest of my family but in time some-  body influenced her that I did not do enough  for her and she left me but I still furnished  her with means, as to the Laboring for her  support I expect she did for all my family done  the same more or Less yet I assisted them all 
 of a hearing before the Bishop and counsel as soon as he  arrives he being absent at present. the following is his  receipt of settlement    Sunset Yavapai Co A T. Dec 19th 1878  This certifies that having been connected with  the United Order company of Sunset and having  lately withdrawn, that the said company have  this day settled with me in full to my entire satis-  faction    Abraham Perkins.    Since my return to Sunset I have been  visited by a good many of the immigration and  I am turning as many to St John as I can  There is one feature in all our immigration this  season I am very sorry to see. There is hardly a  family that has emigrated to Arizona this season  that have brought breadstuff enought hardly to last  them to Sunset. Bro Smith has had to send hundre-  ds of pounds of flour back on the road to feed the  people to get them as far as here; and the hundreds  of the immigration are looking to Bro Lot Smith  to feed them for a year to come. And Sunset is the    only settlement in Arizona of the Saints who has  a bushel of grain to spare, and he has not one  bushel to spare where he should have ten to feed the  multitude. And althought they raised 3000 bushels  of grain at Snow-Flake when we were at Conference  one half of the people of that place asked him for  grain or flour to furnish them for a year to come  and a great share of the Mormon people of Arizona  are looking to him to furnish them bread as they did  last year, but he cannot do it. He has had a  good crop of wheat and corn but he cannot a  quarter supply the wants of the people if they did  not use a bushel at Sunset. He said to me today  he would have to save all his bran and shorts to  grind up for bread.  And that old fraudulent Thres-  hing Machine sent here by H. Clawson has broken  down so they cannot thresh what they have got  until a small pinion wheel is sent from St. Louis  or Z. C. M. I., he has sent to both places for it. I  have inquired of the emigration why they come without  breadstuff. Some say that Bp Johnson of Kanab

I was  rather asstonished at it as we had had no  Difficulty together I told president Young I would  give her a Bill if He said so.

 has told all the emigration not to load down  their teams with flour, they can get all they want in  the settlements as cheap as in Utah. Others say they  go by Bro Hatch's letters that tell them what to  bring to Arizona to exchange for grain. Bro Hatch  himself has not got a bushel of wheat or flour to feed his   own big family. he looks towards Sunset for bread  And even Brigham City across the river who raised  1200 bushels have sowed 300 or 400 bushels and eat  up the rest and want Lot Smith to loan them 1500  bushels to last them until harvest, and so it goes.  There was not 100 lbs of flour at St John to be boug-  ht. Bro Smith bought all the beans they had some  300 lbs and this is the condition of the Saints in  Arizona ^to day^ and we cannot buy a bushel of wheat or flour  without going several hundred miles. I do not think  nearer than Albuquerque, or Salt River. the latter  is the nearest, 250 miles but a terrible road. And I  have neither mail nor Telegraph that I can  send a word to the Bp of Kanab but I wish that  Bro Nuttall would telegraph to Bp Johnson to

 to get the engine out of  the Temple as it is doing  a great deal of damage  in blacking the walls on  the outside. It will cost  a thousand dollars to  put the Temple in as good  repair as it was when the  engine was first put in  and the longer it continues  the worse it will be.

There is  some 60 persons camped 30 miles down the river say  they are poor no bread and nothing to buy it and want  to wait two months for some children to be born  and mothers to get well and are looking to Lot Smith  to feed them while there and afterwards. And there is  certainly a peculiar spirit with many of the emigrants  this season, they seem to think and even say that Bro  Lot Smith is under obligation to feed them and never  think of paying anything for what they do get. In  fact one man said that belongs to the poor camp of  60 that come to get flour, meat and molasses that  his company was not going hungry as long as Lot  Smith had wheat or corn. But I have said quite  enough on this subject. But I hope counsel will be  given to future emigration to bring bread with them

Woodruff this morning, which gave us much news                                                     and much joy, and likewise put me in mind again                                                 of writing to you, for many times I have thought  I would sit down and write to you, but a multiplicity  of cares has prevented until now, my family are  all quite well at present except my self, my own  health is not as good as when I was in America  I was quite sick last night, and write with a trembling  hand this morning, this climate seems to damp to be  healthy, we have a little daughter her s about six  weeks old.

I am vary happy, in the society of my husband  and family I think we never enjoy'd our selves better.  the work is rolling on rapidly, them truth is progressing  among this wicked generation, and this causes our hearts  to rejoice, and our souls to be made glad, we shall sloy  be looking for four of the twelve, and many other Elders  to arrive soon, we shall be much pleased to see them,  no doubt you well know how this seems to be situated

 The destruction of Stock this year for the want of food  and water and starting flour has been dreadful. Many  have lost half of their stock and some nearly all.      We received your letter in answer to ours on the  timber question, also Bro Stayners with the scraps for  which please receive our thanks, and I am happy to  be able to inform you that we have received an answ-  er from Mr Kelly which seems favorable. The following  is a copy.        Prescott Arizona Dec 29th 1879    Lot Smith Esq. Dear Sir.  Your favor received and I have this day  transmitted the same to the Hon. Commissioner  of the General Land Office and asking further  instructions in the matter and hoping at the same  time that he will see the necessity of the case and  will not require anything further done in the  premises. Very Respectfully Your obedient Servt,    Wm N. Kelly Register  Also from Mr. Campbell the Arizona Delegate who  thinks as soon as Congress meets that he can  get the co-operation of all the Teritorial delegates      and get the law repealed or amended so as to  meet the wants of the people of the Territories      Concerning the weather I will say we have  had a few inches of snow in the valley and few  sharp days, but the snow soon goes and the  sun warm and pleasant compared with Utah  weather. I was very much gratified with the  news that there would soon be a new boat at the  ferry, for I have had my fears ^that^ there would be human  life sacraficed by crossing the river in the old boat  I will also say that I have long ago become convin-  ced that Bro Foutz is not the man to preside over  that ferry. He drinks too much whiskey speculates  too much and does not accommodate the people or att-  end to his business as he should. I did not know  anything about the man when John W. engaged  him, as soon as I learned this I requested Bro John W.  to settle with him, pay him off and discharge him,  and put the ferry into the hands of Bro Johnson who  is a worthy, industrious, acommodating honest man  who will do justice to all parties. all the emigration     
 to President Young and his party.  You met to greet Prophets, Apostles and  inspired men. This is a privilege, which  no other generation of young people  have enjoyed for eighteen hundred  years, until Joseph Smith, the Prophet  was raised up to lay the foundation  of the Church and Kingdom of God on  the earth; a privilege for which I would  have felt amply repaid if I had to travel  a thousand miles, in the days of my boyhood  to have witnessed. Now my young friends  I wish you to remember these scenes   you are witnessing, during the visit of  President Young and his brethren—You,  my young friends, treasure up the teach-  ings and saynings of these Prophets and Apostles  as precious treasures while they are living  men and don't wait until they are dead.  aA few days and President Young and  his brethren—those Prophets and Apostles  and Bros Benson and Maughan will be in  the Spirit world, you should never  forget this visitation. You are to become  men and women, fathers and mothers,  yea; the day will come, after your father's  and the Prophets and Apostles are dead 
 Great Salt Lake City, Feb. 25, 1860.    To the Citizens of Washington Co.    We embrace the opportunity afforded us  by the return of the Hon. Jacob Hamblin to address you a few  lines in relation to your agricultural pursuits. The president  and Board, as well as the members, of the Agricultural So-  ciety feel a deep interest in your industrial enterprises, &  especially in the production of cotton, which is a staple  very much needed, and as a home production will  scarcely rank second to any other.    Premiums will be offered by the Society this season,  which will be calculated to stimulate a competition in  the various settlements of your country. You have every  reason, so far as we have been acquainted, to anticipate  success in cotton culture; the sums offered by the Society  as premiums, though small, will be sufficient to en-  courage many to pay more particular attention to  cotton culture, especially those who cultivate small por-  tions of land, than has hitherto been done. Efforts are  making, which we think will be crowned, no doubt,   with success, to introduce machinery for cotton man-  ufacture, some of which will be brought this season.    The introduction of every staple in these mountains  has been attended with more or less difficulty. If  you do not become discouraged, your success is  certain. Let therefore none be disheartened, but  continue to improve the cotton lands of your county, 
 in a land of strangers far from your friends and   home, the face of an old acquaintance is dear, and  seems we are glad to behold them, several of the American  brethren sailed on the first of Jan, there are not many left  and a great field of laborur. I have vary little society  here, my time is confined to my family, the saints in Liverpool  are not so warm hearted as in America, therefore I do  not enjoy the society of the saints in this place, they  seem more free in other branches, but I have not been  from home but little. I have not much news to write  but could I see you I could talk much but this privilige  is denied me for the present I received a letter this morning  from Sister Benson dated Oct. 3 Weber river I received one  or two before from her and sister George A. they were vary  interesting she said sometimes the wind blew high and   sometimes low her health was vary poor. I hear you are  going to the vally in the spring, sometimes I almost envy  you this pleasure and then again I do not, for I feel contented  when I am with my family. If you see sister Parley give   my kind love to her and family tell her to write and  send me her address and I will write to her does she get  any letters from Parley is she contented, when will she  go to the vally. you and Br. Woodruff are often enquired  about, as as well as sister Parley, sister Enion talks much  of you and your little Susan she keeps her likeness  hanging up in the parlor. Mr. and Mrs. Collinson  come often to see us we expect they will soon come into  the church. Mr. Tuton and Nniece are vary much apposed  Br. Kelsey and Dykes arrived here about two weeks ago    Br Kelsey is with us yet    [sideways text] Orson Pratt & Lady Feb 4th  1850    Mr. P. cut my letter short by wishing to write some  himself give my love to all the sisters in the vally that inquire  after me tell Sister Young and Kimball to write to me.

 like him very much but complain of Foutz.       I was thankful to hear your health and the Council  was good and that Bros Pratt & Richards were impro-  ving. As to my health I am all right except my  lungs. When I got cold in the fore part of winter I  hardly get rid of it until spring. Let one go where I  will in this country among the Saints I hold meetings  every night. And the change of beds camping in wagons  and open houses I keep a cold on my lungs and do a  good deal of coughing, and two days while on my  journey I could hardly speak loud, but I am  well now except a ^some^ lingering cold. We have good  meetings, the Spirit of God is with us and union am  ong the people. When I am not travelling among  the Saints or Lamanites I make it my home at  Sunset. Bro Lot Smith has built me a good house  and he with the brethren & Sisters here have fitted me  up the best room I have been in in Arizona, a good  panel door, lock and key two good windows with  curtains chimney, fireplace, plenty of wood good  floor well carpeted a fine Dinwoodey bedstead       
 May 12th, 1874    Editor Deseret News    In company with C. C. Rich and Wm.  Budge we held a meeting on the 12th of May  with the Saints in Evanston.    13th. Held a meeting with the Randolph Branch  of the Church.    14th. Preached to the Saints in Laketown.    16th & 17th. Held meetings in Paris and entered  into the United Order and organization of the  Bear Lake Stake of Zion by appointing the  following officers:  President, C. C. Rich;  1st Vice President, Wm. Budge;  2nd [Vice President], H. J. Horne;  Secretary, Robt. Price;  Asst. Secretary, Geo. Passey;  Treasurer, Thos. Slight;  Directors, H. Duffin, Geo. W. Sirrine, J. C.  Rich, W. Hoge, J. A. Hunt, Geo. Osmond,  Ira Nebeker, Chas. Robinson, Niels Wilhemsen.    18th.

 and gone into the Spirit world you will  have the privilege of going into the  tower of a glorious Temple, built unto  the name of the Most High God ^East of us upon the Logan Bench^, and  while you stand in the tower of that Temple  and your eyes survey this glorious valley,  filled with cities and villages, occupied  by tens of thousands of the Latter-day Saints, you  will then call to mind this visitation  of President Young and his company.  You will say 'Tthat was in the day when  Presidents Benson and Maughan presided  over us that was the day when President  Young and the Apostles were with us—that  was before New York was destroyed by an   earthquake; it was before Boston was  swept into the sea by the sea heaving  itself beyond its bounds; it was before  Albany was destroyed by fire; yea; at  that time you will remember the scenes  of this day, treasure them up and forget  them not." President Young followed  and said "What Bro. Woodruff has said  was revelation and would ^will^ be fulfilled."    Up to the time these remarks were made  it never had entered into the heart of any man  of building a Temple in Logan. Wilford Woodruff 
 and your manner of management, until you become  master of the art of raising cotton by irrigation.    Your attention to the culture of indigo, madder,  & tobacco is also respectfully recommended. Your success  in the cultivation of  the Sorghum sucre, or Chinese  sugar cane, appears to be unrivalled in these  mountains.    We recommend the propriety of some of your  well-informed brethren visiting the various settle-  ments, and delivering public as well as private in-  struction upon the subject, and stirring the brethren  up on the necessity for, and the best manner of, rais-  ing cotton, that we may not be dependent upon  a distant market for this necessary staple,  which is so extensively called for. Bishops Coving-  ton & Judd, & Judge Mc Cullough, or other com-  petent persons, would, no doubt, willingly take   upon them this labor.    The board have ordered a machine, which  will take the cotton in the seed and make 50 lbs.  of cotton yarn per day, with twelve spindles.  Cost, about 300 dollars, delivered here. It gins, cards,  and spins, and can be turned by hand, or any  light water or other power. If any of you wish  these machines, and can order one, singly or  by clubbing together, and the money is here by   Conference, they can be delivered in Utah this  season. 
 and good bed and a good sister Mary Smith to  wait on one like a kind mother, and my room is the  council house of the fort. The emigrating brethren  call upon me by day and the Sunset brethren in  the evening and we talk together and council  upon the things of the Kingdom. And I am as hap-  py as any old bachelor can be and I think rather  more so, for when I kneel down to pray I remember  that I once did have some wives and children in  Utah and think I still have whose prayers ascend  up to g^G^od for one. When I return from a journey  the little boys and girls of the fort run to me to  shake hands with me and are as glad to see me  as though I was their father, and if the little  fellows have any difficulty they run to me to settle  it for them thinking that Bro Allen can make  everything right. There is another strange feat-  ure springing up through this country. I find a  crop of fine plump little boys from 10 days to a  year old bearing the name of Wilford. I myself  am not the father of any of them, but am the     
 Dear brother Woodruff:    I received your letter of Jany.  174th, and I can assure you that it was a great  treat to me. The news from the valley is really  glorious: The Lord is truly favoring Zion. I should  havinge written to you more frequently, but I have been  too busy to write. I expect to take the Steamer in the  fore part of March for Halifax and Boston. I am un-  certain as to the day of leaving Liverpool, but I thinke there  is a steamer which leaves on the 9th of March. I  shall probably see you in Boston as I pass through. I will  bring the I eleventh vol. of the Star for you including the  pamphlets—the ninth and tenth volumes are not complete   Some nos. are lacking. I think Elder Orson Spencer  took the ninth and tenth volums bound for you.   I am glad to hear that you are going to get  all the saints you can out from the U. S. that  the book of Mormon may be fulfilled and that  the just judgments of heaven may not be stayed  from that guilty nation. I expect to get back again  to England in July. I feel very anxious to see the   gospel preached to all nations, and to labor with  my might until it is done. Therefore I cannot think  of spending much time in America. I am overjoyed  to hear that the some of the twelve with elders are on their  way to the nations. Bro. Kelsey has arrived in good health and    [sideways text] after me tell Sister Young and Kimball to write to me.

 The Board will award about 260 dollars,  in 20 premiums, for cotton, varying from 30 to  about 5 dollars each, on fields varying from half  an acre to ten acres each; also about 90 dollars  as preminum for tobacco, and about 50 dollars for  dye-stuffs.    We forward with this, a number of circulars  of the Board, from which you will see the recom-  mendation of the parent society, of the organization  of branch societies. It is our wish that you or-  ganize a society in your county. The Com-  mittee to make the award or premiums will  be chosen from among yourselves.    We request the bishops, their counsel-  ors, teachers, and all the Elders, to use their influ-  ence and exertions to lay the foundation for the  clothing of Israel with garments of their own  make, as a religious duty, as well as a meas-  ure of political economy, public policy, and  absolute necessity for the benefit of the kingdom  of God.    You have doubtless the best climate in  the Territory for the production of fruit, especially  the culture of the grape. We hope that the en-  terprise and energy of the citizens will not let  these advantages lie unimproved.

 Cambridgeport Mass Febuary 15 AD 1849    To the Historian of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.    Dear Brother Richards, I forward to you as you are the Historian of the Church, A file of ^the^ the New   York weekly Herrald, with this communition. I have sent some to you and President Young  by Elder Rockwood & others, & will continue to send as often Ias I have an opportunity. From   the Herrald, you will draw an idea of the signs of the times throughout the word since you left  the States. Elder Appleby has kept a record of affairs as they have transpired during the past  season for the benefit of the Church which He may forward to you soon. I have also watched  the signs, And occasionally made an Extract in my Journal, & on the first day of January 18489  I recorded A summary or synopsis of the same, A portion of which I will forward in this communiac-  ation to you: As it may in some measure be interesting to have A view of things, As they are passing in   Great Babylon, which is separated from you by the sage deserts, And High Mountains of Israel.    "Thus ends the year of eighteen hundred and forty Eight. A Year big with with Events. A year in   which the fig treees tree hath rapidly put forth her leaves and blossomed for the summer. A year  which has laid the foundation for the fulfillment of more prophecy & Revelation than whole  centauries in other ages. Thrones have been cast down, whole kingdoms overturned, And the   Power of the Pope of Rome laid prostrate, and He driven from his kingdom. All the Nations of  the Earth convulsed. Revolutions, wars, Anarchy, & confusion have followed each other in rapid  succession. Cholera, plagues, fire and famine followed in the train. And last of all though not least  in importance is the foundation laid for the disolution of the Amarican Goverment. While  these theings are going on, The Ottoman Empire with many of the Nations of the East have   come to the conclusion that the Jews are human beings, and are now saying to them, you may now  go home, And rebuild Jerrusalem and your Temple and we will help you. These are some of the   leading features of the signs of the times of Eighteen hundred forty Eight.    The revolutions of Europe commenced with France. The people rose in mass, had three days fight  at the end of which they drove Louis Philipi King of the French out of the kingdom with all the  Royal family. The people entered the Turrelles, took the Throne upon their shoulders, carried it into  the streets, and dashed it to peaces upon the ground. The people then undertook to Esstablish a   Republican Goverment. It was said there were ownly 500 killed the first three days fight,  afterwords A reaction took place when it was reported that some 15000 were killed. They have   since organized, And Louis Napoleon Bonaparte is now President of France. The Jerman  states and Prusia next followed in Revolution, which still remians unsettled. Although the   King of Prusia has called A constitutional Goverment. Next the Kingdom of Austria  arose in mass, drove the Emperor from his Throne & kingdom. He afterwards returned  raised armies, & bombarded Vienna eight days. Bloodshed continued untill the Emperor  Abdicated his Throne. The Emperor of Russia has also had wars & difficulties in 
 God-father of a number of them if blessing them  would make me so. On sunday morning after our  return I was called upon by Bro Lot Smith  to bless a fine son of his 10 days old, born to him  in our absence by his wife Alice Ann Richards Smith  weighing 11 lbs when born. I sealed upon him the  name of Wilford Woodruff by request of his father.  I hope these babies may live and make better men  than their namesake. I have had a good deal of  time to read, meditate, and pray since I have been  on this mission. I have read the Bible, Book of  Mormon, Doctrines & Covenants since being here  besides the Hystory of France & England & McCabes  Hystory of the World, Blair's Lectures on Rhetoric  and Belles Lettres and other works. I have read a  good deal more than I can remember or have  digested, but I have found the Sacred books very  profitable to me. I could hardly have believed  that I could have been as contented as I have been  on this mission. I have had nothing else to do but  to try to do good, preach the gospel, strengthen the      Saints, to visit the Lamanites and try to build  up Zion. I have had no desire for gold, Silver  property on speculation. I have had no use for  money, occasionally somebody would give me 2  or 3 dollars, I would give it away the first charit-  able chance I had. All my wants have been  supplied. The Saints would take no money from  me for anything done for me. Bro Lot Smith has  supplied me with all the clothing I have wanted  reward and why should not I be contented and  happy under the circumstances in which I have  been placed. Among other blessings I have had a  good Sister McNeil ready to come at my call to offici-  ate as my scribe or copyist and I think there is great  necessity for this for I think sometimes I have mur-  dered more paper than any man living on earth  of my age. And if it was all put into one volumes  in a readable form it would be the largest book ever  produced and the greates variety of succotash and  the world might call it the greatest romance  but enough upon this subject strain.

I hope you will not sctop in the valley  long when there is such a great worke to  be done abroad. The work is rolling on in this  country. About eleven thousand baptized during the  last 17 months. I am now making preparations  to increase the circulation of the Star from 5000  to between 20 and 30000 by reducing the retail  from 2 and ^a^ half pence to one penny. The prospects  of carrying these these arrangments into effect are  very good. We shall probably issue ^every forth half month^ 20000 or more  during the last six months of the present vol. An  immence deal of good can be done through the   press. We have several native preachers in French  on the channel Islands between England & France  The ship "Josiah Bradlee" sails from this port  to-morrow loaded with saints—262 souls. The  ship "Argo" saild on the ninth of Jany—402 souls  saints. I shall send out another ship the last of   this month.

 his dominions, untill he has in many intstances been under necessity of yielding to the  wishes of the people untill his Throne has been in danger. The Irish have made A struggle  to throw off the British Yokke Yoke, but they have failed in it. Yet their is trouble brewing  for the British Goverment. The Roman Empire have risen up in their strength, And compelled  the Pope to make change after change, And at last have dashed his power to the Earth, Assassin-  ated his counsellors, And driven him from his Papal seat & Throne, which has never befor been  vacated for more than one thousand years. And He has had to seek protection by flexing  fleeing to other Nations. The world are ready to cry out that it is strange indeed that republican-  ism is about to plant ists standard at the seat of the Mother of Abominations, the head of  Rome. The Nations of the Earth at the same time are begining ^to say^ to the despised Jew, outcast &  down trodden for Eighteen centuries you, too, are at last discovered to be a man—with the common  Elements of Humanity—you, too must be free, you may not ownly enjoy the rights of citizenship  but you may return home to the land of Judea, rebuild Jerrusalem, And lay the foundation of   your Temple once more, more glorious than at the begining. "This sentiment has the past year  for the first been formerly recognized not ownly by the Sultan but by nearly all the great  powers, including the English, Russian, & Italian." One glorious feature in the Revolutions of   Europe & the signs of the times is that it is dashing in peaces & breaking asunder all bars &  petitions against the introduction of the proclamtion of the gospel of Jesus Christ to  all the world. Go forth, now ye Elders of Israel, and make A proclamation of "this gospel of  the Kingdom to Evry nation, kingdom, tounge, & people, under the whole Heaven as A witness  unto them that the End may come" I judge from A letter written by Elder Orson Spencer  that some from England are preparing to improve the present opportunity of spreading the  gospel to those Nations. He says "There will soon be some vary Effecient preaches in the  French Nations. We also have A learned Hindo in this country that speaks more than  A dozen different languages Arabic &c who is preparing to go to Asia to preach the  gospel soon." While these things are going on in the East yet as for a moment turn our thoughts  to the Position of Blood stained America. A Nation though Blessed above all other Nations under  Heaven, yet she has of late been guilty of sheding the blood of Apostles, Prophets, Patriarchs, and Saints.  she has sufferd mob rule, to take the place of constitution law and order, and what position  do we find her in at the close of this year. Not ownly one of her states, Ohio has disgraced  herself by sitting having a legislator sit for weeks and spend their time fighting for the mastery  instead of doing the business of the People. But the leaders of the whole Nation at Washington  are engendering the spirit of Party strife, hatred, disunion & war, meeting in separate parties  and laying plans for the dissolving of the Union and the Annihilation of the American Government  And James Gordon Bennett of the New York Herrald, And other Editors after Prophesying month  after month that there was no dangers of dissolving the Union, are with all there prophesies  recorded in their paper staring them in their face, under the neccessity of recording the account  of the parties, ways, And means, made use of to accomplis And bring to pass the vary things they had 
 I occassionally feel a desire to be with my Quorum  in Salt Lake City in their Prayer circles, and to occupy  a seat with them in the Tabernacle and join them  in bearing record and testimony of the Kingdom of  God and warning the people of that which is to  come. Then again I reflect and understand that there  are already more Apostles in Salt Lake who are lifting  up their voices and declairing the word of the Lord  unto both Saints & Sinners than they will listen to  with in faith and carry out their counsel and I fear  this is the case with many who profess to be Saints  The year 1880 is ushered in with a strong determinat-  ion of our Government to make war upon the Saints  and Kingdom of God, but they will prevail no  farther than the Lord permits. They are in His  hands as well as we are. And the warfare is between  God and the Nation and He will prevail.    When the Elders in Ohio in 1831 called upon   the Lord to stay His hand in Judgment upon the  Nation, the Lord informed them He could not  deny His word, but exhorted the Elders to 
 3    The Board will award about 260 dollars,  in 20 premium, for cotton, varying from 30 to  about 5 dollars each, on fields varying from half  an acre to ten acres each; also about 90 dollars  as preminum for tobacco, and about 50 dollars for  dye-stuffs.    We forward with this, a number of circulars  of the Board, from which you will see the recom-  mendation of the parent society, of the organization  of branch societies. It is our wish that you or-  ganize a society in your county. The Com-  mittee to make the award or premiums will  be chosen from among yourselves.    We request the bishops, their counsel-  ors, teachers, and all the Elders, to use their influ-  ence and exertions to lay the foundation for the  clothing of Israel with garments of their own  make, as a religious duty, as well as a meas-  ure of political economy, public policy, and  absolute necessity for the benefit of the kingdom  of God.    You have doubtless the best climate in  the Territory for the production of fruit, especially  the culture of the grape. We hope that the en-  terprise and energy of the citizens will not let  these advantages lie unimproved To supply  Zion with the choice wines of her own make,  for her Sacraments, as contemplated in the 
 labor faithfully and prune the vineyard for the  last time. The 166 & 167 pages of the D.C. as well  as the 45 section as well as other revelations show  what the Lord intends doing and He will not  deny His Word in these instances than in the  former. As a people we should trust in God and  exercise faith in His word. I feel that Bro  Cannon has a hard warfare during this Session  of Congress and needs the faith, prayers and  support of all the Saints.    It is a general time  of health with the people of this country. I have  just heard from a letter from Farmington, that  Bro Thomas Smith was appointed to take 100  or 150 families and start in March to come to  St John. I have just been conversing with Bp  Freeman and Lot Smith who came through in  February. They think Feb. would be a better  month than March to cross the Sevier country  and Buckskin Mountains. They think in  March it is more stormy and roads breaking up  than Feb. and if they put it off much later 
 been prophesying against. And while the senators & statesmen from the slaves states meet  in convention and resolve, that if slavery is Abolished or prohibited in the District of Columbia  or the Territories of New Mexico or Calafornia, that they will immediately dissolve the  Union, ^&^ lay taxes upon the shipping of the free states. At the same time citizens & statesman of  the free states meet in convention, And Resolve that if those things are not done  that they will dissolve the Union. While these parties are growing more & more  determined & further & wider Apart, still the public mind seem to be blinded as to the   result of these resolutions, And seem ignorant concerning the fruit which will be produced  from the seed of their own sowing. yes they have eyes but see not, ears but hear not, &  hearts but do not understand, while the servants, of God filled with inspiration, can behold  the scene in its true light, And comprehends the result with as much certainty as did  Noah, Lot, & Jesus, each in their day while beholding the conduct of the Antedolouvi-  ans, Sodom & Gomorrow, or the inhabitants of Jerruselem. And as the words of the Lord  were fulfilled in the former case, in like manner will they be in the latter. During the  past year the Asiatic Cholera one of the plagues of the last days has again made its appe-  arance throughout Europe slaying its tens of thousands. It has Appeared through England  & Scotland, And just Arived in America. It is in New York, New Orleans, Mobeal, Memphis  Cincinnati, Pittsburg, and nearly all the towns on the Missiissippi River the last accounts  say about 100 deaths daily in New Orleans. Crime of evry kind has apparently increased throughout  the United States during the past year, 100 per cent, it appears as though the cup of their  iniquity was full, And the hour of their judgment had come, And that calamity, confusion sorrow  And Death had recieved their commission to visit this land, And in some instances the hearts of man  are begining to fail them for fear of those things coming on the Earth. And their cry is that an awful  uncertainty is resting upon all things. I cannot close my Record upon the signs of the times of 1848  without turning my eye towards Zion, yes Zion, which is not now merely a phantom of the brain or a  name, but actually a living thing, truly she is yet but a babe, just born, yet she has a tabernacle, the mountains  of Israel, her bed is in the chamber of the rocks, her garden one of the rich gard valleys of Ephraim.  She speaks; And her vioice is as the voice of GOD. She has A spirit which burns likes flames of fire  she has power, and has started a little stone a rolling ^from the mountain her habitation^ which increases as it goes, it is causing the Earth  to quake & tremble, take care ye nations it will grind you to dust. She has messangers which go & come  at her bidding, one of them can chase a thousand, & two put ten thousand to flight, they command  the Elements & they obey them. She has an Ensign for the Nations to flee to, she has A law  which will soon govern the Earth. She is born in the generation that David had a view of.  O Praise the Lord I am a witness that mine Eyes have beheld her. She has keys to open, And no man  can shut, or shut & no man can open. Her power is from Heaven, whare she has noble senators  who plead her cause both day & night. This is the Zion I seek after, this is the Zion I speak off. Her Church  is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. Her city was sought out in 1847. And the Lord  has favored her from that time, And during the year 1848 the Church has been organized with 
 than this that they will hardly have time to  put in spring crops, the companies who come in  the spring should make some arrangements to  bring breadstuff with them, but if there could  be arrangements so that flour could be collected  at Kanab it would be better than to haul it  from Northern Utah. Another thing I want to  name, those who are coming expecting to pay for  land, if they could bring money instead of stock. I   think it would be better for there is such a loss of  stock in driving them it would be better and  much less money trouble to bring money than stock  And the men we bought St John of said ^if^ they could  get all the money down they would take $10 a  head instead of the cows but they will take cows  at any time I think from $13 to $15 a head  I think those who have money should bring it  instead of stock. Those who could sell their stock  for money would do well to do it. But as I have  lengthened out my communication altogether  beyond what I expected I will close. If you      can spare time and patience to read it I will  endeavor not to be so lengthy in my next.      My love to yourself and Council.    Br Smith wishes to be remembered to you  all.  That the blessings of God may sustain  you and give you the victory over all your  enemies is the constant prayer of your Brother  in the gospel    W. Woodruff

Organized the Fish Haven branch of  the United Order with the following Officers: 
 a first Presidency of three persons viz. Brigham Young, Heber C Kimball, & Willard Richards,  who have gatherd to the Mountains of Israel in the valleys of the Great Salt Lake, Great Basin  North America, And taken with them some three thousand saints, with there flocks & herds  which makes A population of about seven thousands souls in the City of the Great Salt Lake.  The Lord has also blest their land which has brought forth in Abundance. And while ^the^ Lord has  ^been^ multiplying blessing upon Zion in her quiet habitation, Her messengers have been crying aloud to the  Nations of the Earth & the Isles of the sea, preaching the gospel unto the & uttering their testimony  in the power of God & the gift of the Holy Ghost, untill they have gatherd their thousands  together, untill one of the Twelve Apostles of the Lamb, (Orson Pratt), Estimates that it will take  three hundred ships to remove the saints from the British Isles alone to the land of Zion.  The saints who were gathered in the valley of the Sacramento, have discoverd such vast mines of  gold, silver, copper & other precious ores that the report of it is creating great excitement throughout  the world, Esspecially in the United States, untill tens of thousands are rushing to the gold regions to try  to obtain the precious mettal. And as the hand of God has been so visible in all the signs of 1848, may  He continue his work through 1849, and All following years, untill His Arm shall be made bare  in the eyes of all Nations, untill Zion shall shall arive to her full strength of Manhood. "for Brass  may she have gold, for Iron silver, for wood Brass, & for stones Iron, may her Exacters & peace officers  be rightous men, may her Nobles be of Ephriam & Her Governoorr procede out of the midst of him. may all  of her messengers be armed with righteousness in the power of God in great glory. May all the Nations  of the Earth fear & tremble because of her Law, may the wicked find her sons terrible when they  go to Battle against her & not have power to stand before them. May her dwelling places be disting-  uished by A pillar of fire by night And A cloud by day, And in fine may she arise and shine forth  And spread Herself abroad with all that perfection of beauty, power and glory which has ever  been spoken concerning her, even to the full Expectation of GOD, Angels, and Men.

 Bro Taylor, there is another subject I wish  to say a few words upon (although it is against the  wish of Bro Lot Smith) it is this, Sunset, Brigham  City, and St Joseph who live in the United Order  have been verry zealous to sustain the Z.C.M.I. in  Salt Lake in all their purchases but they have  been the most unfortunate of human beings in all  their deal with that Institution, especially in all  Machinery. Bro Smith sent money to buy the best  threshing machine in market, sent to R Burton &  E. F. Sheets to help pick it out, it was put into  Hiram Clawsons hands and he sent an old  Whitmans threshing machine that he had had  on hand a long time and could not sell to any  body else, and it was freighted down here to  Sunset 700 miles and as soon as it was opened it  would have been taken back if it had not been  more than 300 miles. it has been a curse to them  ever since it was brought here, in spite of all  they can do it wastes grain and only can thresh     
 from 200 to 300 Bushels a day with the best of  attention, and all three of these settlements have  to depend on it to thresh their wheat. it is now brok-  en down so that it cannot be be used at all  until a pinion wheel is sent from St. Louis or  Z.C.M.I. Bro Smith has sent to both places for  me. He sent for a bill of goods to the Co-op.  when it came to Sunset it all came in one box  Indigo, Alum, Logwood Madder, slates, pencils,  school books &c, all mixed ^together^ in one compound. There  has been something wrong with almost every piece  of machinery sent for, last spring they sent to Z.  C.M.I. for a two horse large sized Molasses cane  mill. It was put into the hands of H Clawson  who sent a small one horse mill with some parts  missing when it arrived. It was entirely too  small for their use and last of all though not  least they wanted to start a tannery had their  vats in place and tanner and materials all  on hand, they wanted a bark mill and sent  money by Bro Flake and when he arrived      at Beaver he not going to Salt Lake requested  the Beaver Co-op. who is dealing with the Z  C.M.I. to send for a bark mill for the Sunset  Tannery, Bro Smith had to send on extra  team to the ferry to bring it but when it arrived  behold! and Lo! it turned out to be a little  giant, a corn-cob mill and not suitable  for grinding bark at all, now all has to wait  until a bak^r^k mill can be bought at St  Louis, brought to the terminns by rail and  then freighted from there by way of Albuquer-  que. Now is not this enough to try the patience  of Saints,? to say nothing about sinners, I think  it is. I think that persons living as far from  Salt Lake as these settlements are who wish to  patronize their own Institutions and pay  down should have a little care and pains  taken for them and not make such blunders  as have been made towards them. The people  of this country do not think that Bro Clawson  has done them justice. They did not know

 L. D. S. Historian's Office,  P. O. BOX 321,    Salt Lake City, Utah, 24 Sept. 1886    President John Taylor. Friday.    Dear Brother.    To-day I received the following  letter from Bro. W. W., which he requested  me to copy and forward to you, as his  handwriting is hardly legible in many  places, being done rather hastily in  his peculiar style of penmanship.    Respectfully,  J. Jaques.    Sept. 23, 1886.    Presidents John Taylor and G. Q. Cannon.    Dear Brethren—Last evening  I had an interview with Brother J. Jaques,  and he brought me your favor of Sep. 20,  which I read with much interest.    I have just arrived in Salt Lake  County. Among other things I had  some private business I could not well  attend to while absent. Then again,  my intention is to take Emma south  with me for the winter. Brother Wm.  H. Thompson brought me up, and

 expects to take me back in a week or ten  days. It was said to Adam it was  not good to be alone. I have been alone  a great deal since I have been a married  man, and for the last two years I have  not been with any of my family but very  little, with the exception of riding with  Emma and her family 200 miles to Ashley,  and since I last wrote you I have been  having some very poor turns of what is  called Bright's disease, or kidney disease,  the worst I have every had. In one instance  I became almost blind, speechless, and had  loss of memory for half an hour. My senses  then all returned. I was very weary  at the time, having travelled about  40 miles that day. Notwithstanding  this, my vital health is good. I have  lost considerable flesh this season. I  thought I had better have one of my wives  spend the winter with me and nurse me.  I have travelled 1000 miles since the first of  June in lumber wagons, though I had  a spring seat the last 350 miles. I am  in Salt Lake County. I do not pretend to  go to the houses of any of my families.  Very few know that I am in the county.  The fewer who know of our whereabouts the

 L. D. S. Historian's Office,  P. O. BOX 321,    Salt Lake City, Utah, 24 Sep. 1886    better, especially yours.    I thought I would take the first oppor-  tunity to notify you that I was in the  county, so that if there was any item  of business of any kind that I could per-  form of any interest to the kingdom of   God while here I wish to do it. I came  very quietly through the count^r^y. None  know of my coming, except a few  safe individuals where we stopped.  The Temple opened again on the 15th.    Now, dear brethren, I want to  lay before you my feelings. I have never  felt better in my life, in spirit, than to-day.  I have been blessed, as you have, with bodily  health and strength to a good old age.  We have both been preserved in life while the  prophets and apostles and thousands of the  Saints have been called into the spirit world,  for the Lord has taken whom he would take,  and preserved in life whom he would preserve.  I have been trying to get ready when called  to go. As to the infirmities of the body, I  expect them, I have them. As to the infirm- 
 ities of the spirit, I would to God I had less of  them. I wish I had been a better man and  done more good. But notwithstanding all  the imperfections of my nature, I rejoice in  God. I am thankful that I live in this day  and generation, that I have received the  Gospel and the priesthood, and that the  Spirit of God is still with me and my  companions. The hand of God is before  me and visible to my eye in the great work  of this last dispensation to all the inhabi-  tants of this world. Yea, the God of Israel  will teach this nation, with its congress-  men and rulers, the governors, judges,  and marshals, and all men, that He  is stronger than man, that His purposes  fail not, that He is able to perform all  that He has set His hand to do, and that  he will perform it and bring it to pass  in spite of earth or hell, or wicked men or  devils, and none can stay his hand. In  this I rejoice. We have nothing to discourage  us, so far as the Church and Kingdom  of God are concerned in their final triumph.  Of course we are called to mourn for sin  and transgression, whether in the church  or out of it. This warfare is with  God and the Heavenly hosts on one side, 
 L. D. S. Historian's Office,  P. O. BOX 321,    Salt Lake City, Utah, 24 Sep 1886    and the fallen angels and the earth beneath  on the other. The devil is ruling over his  kingdom and is making a desperate strug-  gle to overcome the kingdom of God and  its Christ. But they cannot prevail.  Here is the patience and faith of the Saints  and they that keep the commandments of God  and the testimony of Jesus. It certainly is  beginning to be a trying time to the  Saints of God. But if we had no trials,  in our day, of our faith, we would hardly  be at home with the ancient Saints,  who were persecuted and martyred for the  word of God and the testimony of Jesus  Christ. Whatever weakness we may have  as pertaining to our flesh, we certainly ought  not to be afraid to lay down our lives for the  Gospel's sake if required, and I hope and  pray that we may all be prepared for  whatever afflictions the Lord has ordained  us to pass through.    I have been asked a number of times  if I could tell where the October Conference  would be held. I have answered that I 
 presumed the public would be notified through  the proper channel, and from the proper source.    Brethren, I don't know that I have  any counsel to give. I know there is a deep  anxiety throughout the public mind of the  Saints for your safety. But I thoroughly  believe the Lord will reveal to you your  duty, and what course to pursue for your  own safety. I have had some very unpleas-  ant dreams concerning my own safety,  of being in the hands of my enemies.  But they may have been as a warning  of caution, as I have escaped so far.    I received a letter from B. Y. Duffin,  in Arizona with Brother Brigham Young,  on the Lamanite Mission, and things  were brightening up much there now.  A letter from G. Teasdale, of Chihuahua,  gives a history of affairs there, the purchase,  land, water, etc., and said all were doing  as well as could be expected; but of course  you have been made acquainted with all  those affairs by Brothers Snow and Preston  and others who have written.    You are under the protection and  watch care of God our heavenly father, and  you have the prayers of all the faith-  ful Saints of God. And I pray God

 San Berardino, August 8th, 1857.    Br' Woodruff,    Dear Sir.    I have enclosed a  variety of Pear grafts, Plums, and roses, to be forwarded  to you for the Deseret Agricultural & Manufacturing  Society of Utah, presuming you have stocks in which  to bud them. They will reach ^you^ about the time we  bud here with the greatest safety. I send these  as an experiement, and shall enclose, and  forward, a larger package by the next Mail.  The Strawberries requested, we have not been able to  obtain, (as only one person in San Bernardino has  'Hovey's Seedling,') but we intend visiting 'Los Angeles'  next month, for that purpose, and if succesful,  will forward them at once. We regret to learn  of the failure of the 'Roselle,' or 'Judea pie fruit,' in   Utah. It grows luxuriantly here, and is now ripe  for gathering. Please inform us what 'Quince'  you use for Pear Stocks? or whether you wish cutting  of the same? also whether the accompanying 'Scions'  enveloped in this manner, arrived safely. If they do,  we can send any quantity, should you desire them.  Earnestly wishing to serve you in this noble cause,   or any other which will aid in building up Zion.    We remain yours truly, Alden A M Jackson, pr C. A. Jackson.

The only thing  that I can do to secure the seeds you spoke  of will be to institute an enquirey in the  Market at Francisco. If there they can be  procured and forwarded; It is cheering ^to^ hear  the spirit of reformation is rife among  the People and my prayr is that it may  never be less until the people of the Saints  shall cease to sin and corruption is turned  away from them.

 OFFICE OF  B. F. CUMMINGS, JR., B. F.  GENEALOGIST.  Box 695, SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH.    July 9, 1888.    President Wilford Woodruff,    Dear Brother: For several years I have  devoted more or less time to collecting and compiling genealogies, and  if it meets your approval, I would like to make arrangements to pros-  ecute this work on a more extensive scale than heretofore. My plan is  to purchase as many books on the subject of genealogy, or relating  thereto, as I can, and in time collect a good library of such works.  In connection with this library I would conduct an agency or bureau  through which the Saints who might desire to patronize it might obtain  the records of their ancestry.    I already have a library of genealogical works which has cost sev-  eral hundred dollars, and which comprises a good foundation for such  a one as I would like to collect. Brother D. J. Williams of the Fif-  teenth Ward, who is my brother-in-law, is interested in the plan with  me, and if agreeable to you he will go east shortly to purchase books,  and search records for a number of families who desire their ancestry  traced.    My own time in^s^ pretty well occupied with my labors on the "News,"  and it is my desire to at once relieve myself and put the library I  have already collected to the best use, by employing him, and perhaps  others, to do the work of compiling genealogies which is steadily  growing on my hands, and has necessitated my working late evenings,

 728 First South St West  Salt Lake City  Sept 22nd 1888    President Wilford Woodriff.    Dear Brother,    I take the liberty of wrighting  you, according to the advice of  Bro Richards to ask you to  be so kind as to give me a little  counsel. I and my family em-  igrated from England to this City  one year ago and during that time  I have been very unfortunite in  obtaining employment. I am a   Mechinest and have a first class  English Certificate for Engineering. I  have worked at several mechine shops  here and also anything which  my hands have found to do. But  somehow every thing seem's to  oppose me and against me  what ever I undertake to do. 
 much of the time during the last year. I have applications to do work  for many families which I cannot entertain at all, but I think the  plan I have suggested would open the way for hundreds of families of  Saints to obtain their genealogies.    I have acquired a knowledge of and experience in this work which  would enable me to exercise a general supervision over such a library  and agency as I have suggested, without occupying much of my time; and  while I am very much interested in my work on the "News" and desire  that nothing else shall interfere with it, I have felt strongly im-  pressed that I ought not to abandon the work of gathering the records  of the dead. Indeed, I amm scarcely able to resist the requests that  are made of me to trace genealogies, so urgent^ly^ are some of them pre-  sented, and so great is my own interest in the work.    Both Brother Williams and myself desire to be governed entirely by  your counsel, but if the foregoing suggestions meet your approval, we  will proceed at once to carry them out.    Your brother,  B.

 GEMS OF TRUTH.    By B. E. Rich.    Baptism.    DEAR reader, have you truly repented of every sin? Is   your heart humble and your spirit contrite? Do you   desire to be baptized for the remission of sins? If so,   seek after a man of God who has been truly called and or-  dained unto the authority which God hath again restored by   the ministering of holy angels; and when you have found such   an one who has authority from heaven to baptize, go with   him into the water and he will baptize you in the name of the   Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost; and then   your sins shall be remitted on the earth, and the blessings shall   be sealed in the heavens; and then you shall also be baptized   with fire and the Holy Ghost.    ORSON PRATT,  Tract on Water Baptism, p. 48.    A Saul might hear the voice of the Lord from heaven [##Acts 9:3-6##] or a   Cornelius be blessed with the ministration of a holy angel; [##Acts 10:1-7##] but,   though they had been thus favored, to fulfill and comply with   all the requirements of the Lord, it was necessary for them to   be baptized to obtain remission of sins, that they might become  the recipients of the Holy Ghost through the ordinance of the  laying on of hands, and be enabled to walk in newness of life.   If they had not complied with this requirement, they would   not have been in a suitable condition to have entered into the   kingdom of God.    GEO. Q. CANNON,  Western Standard p. 162.    We want to sacrifice enough to do the will of God in prepar-  ing to bring up those who have not had the privilege of hear-  ing the gospel while in the flesh, for the simple reason that, in   the spirit world, they cannot officiate in the ordinances of the   house of God. They have passed the ordeals, and are beyond   the possibility of personally officiating for the remission of   their sins and for their exaltation, consequently they are under   the necessity of trusting in their friends, their children and   their children's children to officiate for them, that they may   be brought up into the celestial kingdom of God.    BRIGHAM YOUNG,  Journal of Discourses, vol. xviii. p. 238.    It is not in the power of any man or angel to find a license   in the Bible to receive a person into the kingdom of God with-   out baptism. Jesus Christ has never given any license, but on   the other hand, He has explicitly said, in the most unequivo-  cal language possible, that NO MAN can "enter the kingdom"   without water baptism, or being "born of the water." [##John 3:5##]    ORSON SPENCER, Spencer's Letters, p 50.    The conditions of salvation from death, hell and the grave,   are faith in God, in Jesus Christ, and in the atonement; re-  pentance, reformation, and a godly life; baptism by immer-  sion for the remission of sins administered by divine authority,   the sanctifying effects of the blood of Christ that follows the   water, and the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of   hands by properly ordained ministers. These conditions are   as essential to salvation in the kingdom of heaven to-day, as   they were in the days when Christ and His apostles and elders   declared them nearly nineteen hundred years ago. The same   authority has been restored to the earth. The same apostle-  ship and keys of priesthood, with power to officiate in the   ordinances of the house of God, are again restored to earth,   and the gospel of God is being preached in all nations for a   witness. The same signs follow the believers according to   their faith, obedience, and the will of God. The same unction   from the Holy One is enjoyed by the Saints, and gives them   a living testimony that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, and   Joseph Smith His servant, ordained to usher in the dispensa-  tion of the fullness of times. God has revealed these precious   truths to the Elders and Saints of the Church of Jesus Christ   of Latter-day Saints, and they know they are living in the last   days. Consequently He requires His people whom He hath   redeemed, and unto whom He hath made the Scriptures plain,   to live perfect lives, and to do His will on earth as it is done   in heaven.    B. H. ROBERTS,  Mill. Star, vol. 1. p. 296.    Many have looked upon baptism as merely "an outward   sign of an inward grace;" but this is one of the uninspired   precepts of man, and is not a Bible doctrine; instead of bap-  tism's being the "sign of an inward grace," it is the ordinance   through which the believing penitent obtains a remission of   sins which justifies and prepares the heart for the reception   "of an inward grace." Remission of sins, and "an inward   grace," do not precede baptism, but follow it.    The numerous multitudes that came to John were not bap-  tized in Jordan, because they had previously received forgive-  ness and "an inward grace;" but they came confessing their   sins and were baptized for the remission of them. [##Mark 1:4-5##]    ORSON PRATT,  Tract on Water Baptism, p. 43.    Jesus told Nicodemus that "except a man be born of water,   and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God." [##John 3:5##]  An entrance into the kingdom of God, then, cannot be obtained   by a man who has not been born of water and of the Spirit.   Neither sincerity nor morality will avail, except these essential   ordinances have been attended to. Though the Lord is full of   mercy and love for His creatures, yet His justice and truth   would not permit so flagrant a violation of His laws, as the   neglect of these ordinances would be, to pass unpunished;   much less would He break His own word, where He says   that the man who does not attend to these requirements can-  not enter into His kingdom, by admitting them therein.    GEO. Q. CANNON, Western Standard p. 403.    The necessity of baptism must be understood. It is taught   by some that the observance of this ordinance is optional on   the part of the candidate for celestial glory. This is danger-  ous doctrine. There is no authority for it in the scriptures.   Jesus and His apostles never taught it. It is contrary to their   teachings. Jesus never included a non-essential principle in   the great plan of salvation. Had not baptism been necessary,   He would not have said to His apostles: "He that believeth   and is baptized shall be saved." [##Mark 16:16##]    WM. JEFFERIES,   Tract, "The Gospel Pioneer," p. 15.    Whatever an over-jealous mind may fear concerning the   state of the penitent thief on the cross, and of devout and   upright men that have lived and died in every age of the   world, still let God's word be accounted true, and every man   that gainsays it be esteemed a liar! No man ever put on the   uniform of Christ's followers, such as is worn by subjects of   the kingdom of Christ, until he is "baptized into Christ" for   the remission of sins. Hereby he "puts on Christ." [##Romans 13:14##]    ORSON SPENCER, Spencer's Letters, p. 49.

Br Ray says I must  give them out forthwith, and he will take all the  blame to himself as I have mostly resurvey the City  Lots my intention was, to make out a writing According  to the last act of ^the^ Legislature and get it recorded to you  free from any cost on your part. Pres Ray said that  that ^Pres^ Young had reserved the Block north of the  State house for the first presidency and the Twelve  and all of the lots but one ^except the Block befor alluded to^ must be given out to those  who was on hand to build up the place. But I will do  all that's in my power to make things to your Satisfac  tion Br Gabriel Huntsman can inform you  more on this subject as he will carry this Letter to  the City    Yours truly in the bonds of the Covanant    Wilforod Woodruff, Chandler Holbrook

 LESSONS ON HEALTH.    BY E. F. P.    CHAPTER VI—DAILY OCCUPATIONS.    PEOPLE are employed in so many different branches of  labor, and occupy their time in such various ways that  only a few suggestions which will apply to them generally will  be given here.    If one's occupation causes him to perspire, or "sweat"  freely he should be careful to not cool his body too suddenly  by going from a warm room to a cold place, and there remain-  ing till his body is chilled. He should also use caution in  drinking cold water. When a person is warm and thirsty he  is very liable to drink too much at a time. Ice-water in warm  weather is not the proper drink for anyone, and should not be  used if avoidable.    During the daytime one should try and make it convenient  to stand up part of the time and sit down another part. Too  much sitting or standing is likely to be injurious. While sit-  ting, standing or walking, keep the body erect, with the shoul-  ders thrown back, so the lungs will not be cramped, and  to prevent consumption.    A beauty of nature is that the more graceful one's actions  are the more they tend to health and comfort. By keeping  the body upright, by closing the mouth when not in use, by  avoiding too much boistersous laughter, by appearing cheerful,  pleasant and good-natured, and by keeping our temper we can  enjoy better health than we can otherwise; so that the rules  of deportment which are calculated to make us agreeable to  our associates will also often prove good to preserve health.    If during the day, especially in cold seasons, you should  happen to get your clothing dampened through being exposed  in a rainstorm or by any other means, all wet garments should  be removed as soon as possible, as they will endanger the  health if left to dry upon the body. The feet should be kept  dry and warm by having them properly clothed. When rub-  ber overshoes or boots are used in wet weather they should be  removed from the feet when not needed to keep off the damp-  ness, as they are apt to prove an injury to the feet if this is  not done. The clothing on one's body should never be too  close-fitting or tight, neither in warm nor cold weather. Besides  being uncomfortable such clothing is ruinous to health. The  shape of the body is naturally graceful, and it cannot be im-  proved by any distortions caused by wearing tight-fitting  clothes. The clothing of the body should be suspended, as  much as possible or practicable from the shoulders. Nothing  should be worn that will hinder the free circulation of the  blood, or that will crush any of the physical organs out of their  proper positions.    The covering for the head should not be for keeping it warm  particularly. A young person who has not lost his hair needs  no artificial covering for that purpose; and the head should be  kept bare as much as possisble while indoors. This will help  to keep one from becoming bald.    A reasonable amount of hard labor is beneficial to health;  and no one should be afraid of it, since the Lord has ordained  that man should earn his bread by the sweat of his brow.  It is very seldom that people hurt themselves by too much  work. Having too many things to attend to, and worrying  over them, or an over-amount of mental work with insufficient  physical exercise, is indeed injurious. Persons should seek to  regulate their affairs so as to avoid such conditions.    The proper observance of the Sabbath day should be care-  fully attended to as the Lord commanded. This day has been  set apart as a day of rest; and it is of vital importance that  the body should not be robbed of that rest which it requires.  There is nothing that would be of more benefit to our physical  and mental organization than a relief once a week from the  cares and anxieties of our every-day occupations and studies.    No one should deceive himself with the idea that anything  is to be gained by laboring on the Sabbath as well as during  the rest of the week. The system requires a certain amount  of rest, and if it does not receive it regularly as it should, we  will have to yield to its demands sooner or later. If we refuse  to give our bodies an opportunity to get renewed vigor by a  frequent relaxation from the constant strain upon them, our  constitutions will eventually break down; and we will at last be  compelled to take time to allow them to gain strength. By  going to pleasure resorts, or indulging in sports of different  kinds, will not answer any purpose for which the Sabbath was  intended. There is more or less excitement attending such  recreations, and the mind and body are not so perfectly at rest  as when one calmly observes the Sabbath as the Lord intended  it should be, and that is by attending public worship, partaking  of the sacrament and offering up our praise and thanksgiving  to Him, and by seeking to learn such things that are for our  spiritual welfare, to be nourished with spiritual food; so that  the Sabbath was ordained to be unto man not only a spiritual  but a temporal blessing as well. It is apparent that there is  a two-fold object in every requirement the Lord makes of His  people, and there is also a double blessing attending the  obedience to that requirement.    THE TWO SIDES.    (Concluded from page 197.)    SCENE III.    Same Room.    Mrs. N. A week has passed since the visit of our friend  Aird, and still the gloom that his presence cast over our hith-  erto happy home, hangs over us to some extent.    Mr. N. Although I know the spirit he manifested was not  good, I will confess it has had quite an influence over me;  and I must overcome it.    Mrs. N. Shall I tell you what I think about it?    Mr. N. Yes, please.    Mrs. N. You know the resolution we made the evening  before he came?    Mr. N. Yes.    Mrs. N. Well, I suppose the evil one knew also, and  thought he would take the advantage in an unguarded moment,  and get us to break the resolution we had made.    Mr. N. I had not thought of that, but I believe it is so,  and we must make an effort to overcome it.    Mrs. N. I will tell you my plan. To-morrow is Fast day;  we will fast and pray, and ask God to enable us to cast this  gloom away; and when we have accomplished it, try to always  look on the bright side, for we have had enough of the dark  one.    Mr. N. I approve of your plan. The bright side of any  picture is always the most agreeable to look upon and I—  (knock at door). Come in. (Enter Mr. Andrews.

Leflers flouring Mill. to pay for  which we mortgaged a five acre  lot. we enlarged and remodled  the mill placing new machinery  therein and changing it from the burr  to the roller System. in doing so we  einvolved ourselves heavily, being about  $5000.00/100 in debt and we find ourselves  unable to meet our obligations as they  become due. Under these circumstances  we have been endeavoring to sell our  interest in the mill and redeem our  property but have been unable too  thus far. We are now likely to loose  our five acre lot and also the mill unless  we can make a turn soon.

 American Fork, Utah County, Utah  May the 17th 1889.    To the most venerable  President Wilford Woodruff  Salt-Lake-City.    Dear President and Brother!  Through the grace of our Lord and Saviour Jesus the  Christ, I have, in obedience to your call, been  permitted to finish the translation of the holy  book of Mormon into the Jewish language.    How far I have succeded in making the transla-  tion a correct one, it is not for me to say, but  others familiar with the language of the Jews will  decide upon. I feel that I have been aboundantly  blessed by the holy Ghost, while engaged in perfor-  ming this glorios Work, and in my humble judge-  ment I believe and declare it to be verbally cor-  rect according to the reading in the english book,  and I know that I am justified in saying, that  it sounds even sweeter in the language of the Jews,  then in any other language with which I am familiar  and into which the book has yet been translated.    It has been a Work of love to me, and I never  set down to do it witout invoking the assistance  of the Spirit of the most high God, and today  I am happy to bear testimony that the Lord, the  God of my fathers Abraham Isaac and Jacob, has  accepted of my prayers and blessed me in my Work.

 Wood, Ed. J.    Salt Lake City,  August 9th 1888.    President Wilford Woodruff,    Dear Brother:    Your communi-  cation of Aug. 8th [18]88, was received and  most carefully read over and perused by  me. In answer, I can say that, with  what little experience I have gained, I  realize, to a certain extent, that in or-  der for the Lord's purposes to be brought  about, missionaries must be sent from  Zion to preach the Gospel to all nations  and, in as much as you think me wor-  thy to be honored with this very im-  portant call; and have chosen me, with  others, to carry the Gospel ^to^ the Samoan  Islands, I cheerfully accept the call; for  I know that it is my duty to respond  to any call made by those in authority,  and with the help of my Father in Heaven  I will be ready and start with my  brethern from San Francisco on Thurs: Sept.  20th [18]88.  It is my earnest desire that, in my  humble way, I may be able with my brethern  to perform a successful mission in the sight  of the Lord.    Your Brother in the Gospel, Edw. J Wood.

 it possible for those ^women^ who  followed me, to speak at these  conventions.  For ten years she  has systematically misrepresented  me, & never has my name  appeared in her little paper  with credit.  Altho she would  Eulogize the women I had  made friends to Utah's question.  Belva Lockwood was very  much prejudiced, when I  first met her, gradually this  wore away, & the next year  after my return to Utah, she  wrote me a letter saying  "Get a petition signed by some  of your most influential  women in protesting against  the Suffrage being taken from   you, & I will see that it is  not thrown under the table".  I took it to a meeting in  the 14th Ward, & asked the  privilege of reading it. 
 [FIGURE]    In the providence of our holy father, you, most  venerable President Woodruff, have been spared  to live and to see the openning of a glorious  Aera for the Salvation of God's ancient children  even the house of Israel; and since the Lord has  moved upon you to order that the sacred book  of Mormon shall be put into the language of the  Jews, we can today beheld Messengers of the "Latter  Days" dispensation tarrying around in Jerusalem  the holy City of our God, and opening the way  for the fullfillement of those glorious prommisses  which have been made to the seed of Abraham, ye  to my brethern according to the flesh, the Jews.  But there is another and most wonderfull  sign, which ought to atract your consideration  dear President Woodruff, and which no doubt, will  fill your heart with joy and gratitude to our God,  and it is this: No sooner did you command  the translation of the book into the Jewish tongue,  and no sooner did our messengers the Elders  of Israel arrive in the holy land, then the Lord  moved upon the Emperor and ruler over the land  of Egypt, ye the Sultan of Turkey, to revoke  an Ukas, or a law, which dates more the 900  years bak, and to permit the Jews to return  bak into the land of their fathers, ye the land

To President Wilford Woodruff and Quorum and the Presiding  Bishops    Dear Brethren, I address you relative to the second volume  of Tullidge's Histories of Utah, which is a companion volume of the  History of Salt Lake City. The book will contain the history of all  the Northern Counties of Utah and also of Southern Idaho, as well as  of Western and Eastern Utah— Weber County, Davis, Tooele, Box Elder,  Cache, Morgan, ^Summit,^Wasatch, Rich and Southern Idaho.    Nearly all these counties with their cities are written up, and  two thirds of the book in print, and three thousand dollars worth of  steel plates have been engraved for this vol. and are waiting the issue.  There are Lorenzo Snow (the frontispiece) Lorin Farr, Father Thatcher,  Moses Thatcher, Wm. B. Preston, Chauncey W. West, Peter Maughan,  Judge Wm Hyde, Bishop S. Mollen, F. D. Richards, ^Anson Call^ Jonathan  Browning, Abraham Hatch, John Sharp, the Banker Guthrie,  the miners of the Park, R. C. Chambers & John Daily, and others,  merchants and capitalists of Ogden, besides Wm Budge and James  H. Hart who designs to send their portraits immediately to my  engravers, probably brother Nibbly; also I think others of the  railroad chiefs besides John Sharp.    The second volume is divided into two parts—namely  the general history of the Counties, occupying 600 pages, and suplemental  mental part (or vol) 300 or 600 pages say, most of the latter being  in print. The biographical sup. vol. opens with the Life and  Missions of Lorenzo Snow (25 pages) Father Thatcher, Founder of  the commerce of Cache Valley, Wm B. Preston first Bishop of  Logan, the Pioneer of Cache County, Peter Maughan Captain  James Brown, Lorin Farr, Chauncy W. West, Anson Call, Wm R. Smith

When Apostle Geo Q Cannon addressed the  Congregation Sunday mor: aprill 7th 1889 I see in the Deseret  news as reportad of his remarks that he said. I have heard that  there are some among us who say, that both the Father  and the Son are one person. If this remarks, of his,  are Reference to the case of me had before you there are  some missunderstanding, or have any tale-bearing said  so, i don't no. I do no, that this was what they would have  it to, when i said it reads; the Father Son and Holy Ghost are  one God. But not one Personage. I have never said  thesey are one person, nor wrote it, or read it so, and i can  face, any one, at any time, there that it is not from me.    Yet i believe it is true what the Prophets has spoken  both old and new, and when the Books (Bible, Book of Mormon,  Doctrine and govenants), copert together it surily can't be false.    Then what "new or False Doctrine" are am abused of  as two weeks ago Preseden Syemor B. young wrot a letter to  Pre E. D. Holt, of the 11 Quoram, asking him if E. O.

 Salt Lake City  Sept. 28th 1887.    Prest. Wilford Woodruff,  Salt Lake City  Dear Brother:    Replying to your letter  of the 20th inst. stating that you desire me to  act as the representative of our people on the Board  of Directors of the Orphan Home and Day Nursery  Association, permit me to say: If I were to  consult my personal feelings I would shrink  from the labor suggested, but as you express  a wish that I do so, I will accept the position  and will take immediate steps to connect  myself with the association    With profound respect  Your Sister  Emily S.

 of their inheritance, where according to the scripturs  they shall gather in unbelieve, and where soon af-  terwards the sound of the everlasting Gospel of this  the last dispensation, shall reach them, and bring  them back into the fold of the living Messiaha  Christ Jesus their brother, their Lord and Saviour.    Elder Izodal writing from Jerusalem says: "the ga-  thering of the Jews is no more a matter of believe  but an established fact which I see hearre every  day."    This movement did not begenn, not untill President  Woodruff, our Prophet and Seer and Revelater said  in his letter to me dated 23d of April A. D. 1888:  "your labors in this connection is the translation of  the book of Mormon into the Jewish language, it  being of great value to the Jewish race, and in  the line of fulfilling the  predictions of the  book itself," and in which you will be greatly  aided by the Spirit of the Lord"    What a wounderfull prophecy and how literaly its  fulfilling is at hand!    Yes, I have been mercyfull aided by the Spirit of  the Lord during the year past, and as I am about  to submite the book in the language of my peuple,  to you, I can not withold my burning desire to  ask of you, that it may please you, to consider  how my Way could in the future be opened before  me, that I may go back to my peuple, as it is

Perery & Judge Eldridge^ and others of their class, so that this book of biographies  (or supplement) will embody a vast amount of the history ofthe  Church, our foreign missions, our emigration and pioneer work  besides the building up of the cities and counties of Utah.    This second vol of my Histories of Utah is nearly complete,  but I am unable to finish it without help. Mr Cannon needs money  of me to purchase paper for the remaining part. I have to acknow-  ledge that Cannon & Sons have generously carried much of my  burden. Moses Thatcher has also greatly helped me. Besides  steel plates, he at one time gave me three hundred dollars, and at  another time loaned me $300, which I still owe him, Lorenzo  and further help from the Thatcher family and Bishop Preston.  Lorenzo Snow has also helped me personally with $100, and  also urged his County to help me. Indeed, it is from such personal  help, from these and numerous others, that I have been enabled  to prosecute my costly work so far, rather than from appropriations  from Cities or Counties.    Ogden City at the onset appropriated $1000, but an  injunction was put on it. Some of the citizens then agreed to raise  $1000, but only six hundred were raised, mostly by the members  of the City Council and a few of the Ogden merchants, which,  however, I returned to them in personal service and printers  bills on their biographies and commercial interests; so that it  was no appropriation in any sense. As for Weber County,  though it leads and claims the book, it has refused repeatedly  to help its own history, though ^notwithstanding^ my brother Franklin has  been solicitous for that help in my behalf. Altogether from  these County and City appropriations, I have received about  $2300, while the work has covered two years and half  of labor of myself and two assistants—Joseph Hall and  James A. Little, at a cost of salary and expences alone of

 and by the assistance of my Redeemer shall be, the  only aim of my future life, to go forth and bring  the glorious tidings of the living Messiaha to the  hungry and thirsty after the stream of everlasting  life and salvation in Emanuel the Christ!    Again I say that I have been much blessed during  the year past in which day by day I have been en-  gaged in my holy Work; I have also derived much  blessings from the associations with the Saints, worship-  ping with them our God the most High Jehovah,  where the Spirit from on high has often been poured  out upon me in the congregations of the Saints; I  have also been blessed with a faithfull and noble  daughter in Israel which the Lord gave me for a  helpmate to strengthen my faith, and for which I  am thankfull by day and by night to Him, who is  the giver of all good gifts; but on the other hand  the Lord was also willing to deprive me of the  privileges of His holy house, and I can see now  that your counsel concerning the holy house, given   to me a few months ago, was just and right, be-  cause it helped me to think more deep over  the holiness connected with the great institutions  and covenants of the Lord's Temple; Today how-  ever I can not but mention to you the following  circumstances: My dear Wife has been born and raised  in the covenant and has been allways faithfull in  doing her duties as a L.

 five thousand dollars, in traveling over all these Counties gathering  and writing their history. For a year and a quarter I had Bro  Joseph Hall engaged at $100 per month, and all travelling  and hotel expenses he are ^paid;^ and Elder James A. Little seven months  at $75 and expenses. They were constantly from home traveling,  collecting history and obtaining biographical matter, while I myself  have been out most of the time of the last two and half years  on this same work; which, giving me even a small wage to  support my family, and my expenses, apart from officers  at home, ^this^ will show that I have spent from $5000 to 7000  in making this book, which was ^has been^ far more costly and  laborious to make than the History of Salt Lake City; as that  ^book^ was a growth of years in my own hands ^and^ which was produced  in my own closet; and Moreover I had a committee to  help me in every way and to petition for me for extension of  time and further appropriations: to that Committee—Col. Winder,  Gen R. T. Burton, Geo Reynolds George A Meears, and Judge  Jonasen I owe much, while on this Northern History I have  had no such help, excepting in the personal help of those already  named.    To the cost of making this book as shown above  there must be added the printers and binders and engravers  bills (2000 vols of 1000 pages), giving a total of from ten  to fiften thousand dollars.    Had I know at the onset that the Northern  cities and counties would not have given me generous  help by appropriations, following the example of Salt Lake  City, I would never have undertaken the work, for  I knew by experience something of the labor and cost  of making large volumes of histories of a young nation,  like our modern Israel with his colonizations all over  this western country, the record of which had to be  gathered and constructed into form.
