 with Brother Snow and others. I had no conversation with himThey put up with Brother Snow, but I was informed they got[to] church the friday night they came in, they were not ableto attend conference on Saturday. Brother Snow seemsto think with some caution I would be safe in Salt LakeCity, and He thought the Twelve felt the same. He seems to thinkthe Courts & Marshals here got so far along without the Churchrecords that they find they do not need them. That thereis no necessity of proving any marriage, as they seem tohave adopted Judge Howards views, that it requires very littleLaw and Damn little testimony to convict a mormon.I thought if the presidency had any views to communicateto me about coming to S. L. C. I should be pleased to receivethem. Brother Snow will start in few days for S. L. and wishedme to go with him, but I felt Like waiting a short timelonger, as I have a chance to go in a waggon a weekafter him I think probably it would not be well forme to go by rail I am in the enjoyment of good healthand feel well in spirit. I feel that I can acknowledgethe hand of God in what is going on around us. The army wormCanker worm, catapillar the lice, with all the plagues of Egyptincluding the Judges & Marshals. I think the hand of the Lordis in it Judgments & afflictions must begin at the hand of Godbut the wicked will not escape.

 Edmunds Tucker Bill is passed the House will soon become a Law in some shape at least Enough to take away all rights Gifted, Religious & politicals from the Saints This apparently throws all ourinterest in Houses, Lands, & property into the hands of thieves & robbers and our own Liberties & Lives sought by the same power The question arises in my mind under these circumstan-ces what duty requires me as an individualto do, or what course to persue. My companion E who has been with me some 3 Monthswill soon return to her family, in fact she is needed there as our Daughter who is keeping house has been quite sick and shecannot Leave the children or family permanetlyand if I have much dodging or distance of travel I think I can do it alone better than to have a part of my family with meI have not as yet had any course markedout which I have deciced to follow I have thought when our Enemies grasp all the offices of the Teritory and in a great measure will govern the post offices that there would be No safety for me in Utah and perhaps might be wisdomfor me to go to Arizona & probably on to Mexico In that case could I have your consent for Brothe Jack to furnish me on my Account some$200 to assist me in my travels & living.

 We arrived at St Joseph on the evening of the 8th inst.and on our arrival were informed that the youngestwife of Bro Richards had a pair of twins—daughters.one born 24 hours after the other, but they seemedto think she was doing pretty well. I got hold ofthe weekly news of Dec. 31st not having seen any newsfor some 3 weeks I sat and read an hour and Iwas asked to call in and see Sister Richards that she had a poor spell, I walked into the room, I putmy hand on her head, I saw she was dying, I toldBro. Richards he must give her up, in five min-utes she breathed her last. She was 18 years oldher first children. In two hours after her youngestchild was dead. It was quite a loss to Bro Richardsand sudden.We arrived at Sunset on the 9thwhere I found a package of letters awaiting me amongthem two from you of dade Dec 19th & 29th.

 Great Salt Lake City December 16, 1850Dear brother GeorgeThe copy of the ordinance to provide for the organization of Iron County wasforwarded to you by brother Aaron Farr which we have no doubt you have received 'ere this.Your letter by brother Jackson Stewart was received yesterday evening,and in reply to a question, if there were any further instructions for brother George, we say toyou, that if the weather should unfortunately set in very severe before you are enabled to reachyour destination, we would recommend to you, if you cannot get further than Salt Creek,that we want a good settlement there; if you can get as far as Beaver Creek & shouldget hemmed in with winter, we also want a good settlement there, and as soon as thewinter disappears you can then lead out for Iron County, to fulfil your present instructions.Should you be hemmed in by Winter at either of the before mentionedplaces it will be well for you to build a Fort, make yourselves secure,  & when you leavein the Spring, leave from ten to twenty men in each or either Fort until more assistancecan reach them from this place. There is not the least fear, but that your cattlewill do well any where on the sides of the mountains, for feed is every where abundantand fuel can be obtained in a very short distance from any point. The reason thatwe are so very explicit is, that you may not hurry, or kill any of your cattle, butpreserve them and yourselves, and accomplish all the good you can. And may the Godof Israel bless and prosper you, in all that you put your hand to do, and that youmay return in safety to the bosom of your family & the society of those whom you love dearin the Kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ.Brigham YoungP.S.

Dec 19th 1878This certifies that having been connected withthe United Order company of Sunset and havinglately withdrawn, that the said company havethis day settled with me in full to my entire satis-factionAbraham Perkins.Since my return to Sunset I have beenvisited by a good many of the immigration andI am turning as many to St John as I canThere is one feature in all our immigration thisseason I am very sorry to see. There is hardly afamily that has emigrated to Arizona this seasonthat have brought breadstuff enought hardly to lastthem to Sunset. Bro Smith has had to send hundre-ds of pounds of flour back on the road to feed thepeople to get them as far as here; and the hundredsof the immigration are looking to Bro Lot Smithto feed them for a year to come. And Sunset is theonly settlement in Arizona of the Saints who hasa bushel of grain to spare, and he has not onebushel to spare where he should have ten to feed themultitude. And althought they raised 3000 bushelsof grain at Snow-Flake when we were at Conferenceone half of the people of that place asked him forgrain or flour to furnish them for a year to comeand a great share of the Mormon people of Arizonaare looking to him to furnish them bread as they didlast year, but he cannot do it. He has had agood crop of wheat and corn but he cannot aquarter supply the wants of the people if they didnot use a bushel at Sunset. He said to me todayhe would have to save all his bran and shorts togrind up for bread.  And that old fraudulent Thres-hing Machine sent here by H. Clawson has brokendown so they cannot thresh what they have gotuntil a small pinion wheel is sent from St. Louisor Z. C. M. I., he has sent to both places for it. Ihave inquired of the emigration why they come withoutbreadstuff. Some say that Bp Johnson of Kanab

Others say theygo by Bro Hatch's letters that tell them what tobring to Arizona to exchange for grain. Bro Hatchhimself has not got a bushel of wheat or flour to feed his own big family. he looks towards Sunset for breadAnd even Brigham City across the river who raised1200 bushels have sowed 300 or 400 bushels and eatup the rest and want Lot Smith to loan them 1500bushels to last them until harvest, and so it goes.There was not 100 lbs of flour at St John to be boug-ht. Bro Smith bought all the beans they had some300 lbs and this is the condition of the Saints inArizona ^to day^ and we cannot buy a bushel of wheat or flourwithout going several hundred miles.

 notify all people who emigrate here to buy breadstuff enough to last them till they can raise, and Iwish Bro Taylor would have a notice published inthe News to warn all persons who contemplate emigra-ting to Arizona to bring a supply of bread stuff withthem as there will be the want of bread here. There issome 60 persons camped 30 miles down the river saythey are poor no bread and nothing to buy it and wantto wait two months for some children to be bornand mothers to get well and are looking to Lot Smithto feed them while there and afterwards. And there iscertainly a peculiar spirit with many of the emigrantsthis season, they seem to think and even say that BroLot Smith is under obligation to feed them and neverthink of paying anything for what they do get. Infact one man said that belongs to the poor camp of60 that come to get flour, meat and molasses thathis company was not going hungry as long as LotSmith had wheat or corn. But I have said quiteenough on this subject. But I hope counsel will begiven to future emigration to bring bread with them

Kelly RegisterAlso from Mr. Campbell the Arizona Delegate whothinks as soon as Congress meets that he canget the co-operation of all the Teritorial delegatesand get the law repealed or amended so as tomeet the wants of the people of the TerritoriesConcerning the weather I will say we havehad a few inches of snow in the valley and fewsharp days, but the snow soon goes and thesun warm and pleasant compared with Utahweather. I was very much gratified with thenews that there would soon be a new boat at theferry, for I have had my fears ^that^ there would be humanlife sacraficed by crossing the river in the old boatI will also say that I have long ago become convin-ced that Bro Foutz is not the man to preside overthat ferry. He drinks too much whiskey speculatestoo much and does not accommodate the people or att-end to his business as he should. I did not knowanything about the man when John W. engagedhim, as soon as I learned this I requested Bro John W.to settle with him, pay him off and discharge him,and put the ferry into the hands of Bro Johnson whois a worthy, industrious, acommodating honest manwho will do justice to all parties. all the emigration 
 to President Young and his party.You met to greet Prophets, Apostles andinspired men. This is a privilege, whichno other generation of young peoplehave enjoyed for eighteen hundredyears, until Joseph Smith, the Prophetwas raised up to lay the foundationof the Church and Kingdom of God onthe earth; a privilege for which I wouldhave felt amply repaid if I had to travela thousand miles, in the days of my boyhoodto have witnessed. Now my young friendsI wish you to remember these scenes you are witnessing, during the visit ofPresident Young and his brethren—You,my young friends, treasure up the teach-ings and saynings of these Prophets and Apostlesas precious treasures while they are livingmen and don't wait until they are dead.aA few days and President Young andhis brethren—those Prophets and Apostlesand Bros Benson and Maughan will be inthe Spirit world, you should neverforget this visitation. You are to becomemen and women, fathers and mothers,yea; the day will come, after your father'sand the Prophets and Apostles are dead 
 Great Salt Lake City, Feb. 25, 1860.To the Citizens of Washington Co.We embrace the opportunity afforded usby the return of the Hon. Jacob Hamblin to address you a fewlines in relation to your agricultural pursuits. The presidentand Board, as well as the members, of the Agricultural So-ciety feel a deep interest in your industrial enterprises, &especially in the production of cotton, which is a staplevery much needed, and as a home production willscarcely rank second to any other.Premiums will be offered by the Society this season,which will be calculated to stimulate a competition inthe various settlements of your country. You have everyreason, so far as we have been acquainted, to anticipatesuccess in cotton culture; the sums offered by the Societyas premiums, though small, will be sufficient to en-courage many to pay more particular attention tocotton culture, especially those who cultivate small por-tions of land, than has hitherto been done. Efforts aremaking, which we think will be crowned, no doubt, with success, to introduce machinery for cotton man-ufacture, some of which will be brought this season.The introduction of every staple in these mountainshas been attended with more or less difficulty. Ifyou do not become discouraged, your success iscertain. Let therefore none be disheartened, butcontinue to improve the cotton lands of your county,

 and gone into the Spirit world you willhave the privilege of going into thetower of a glorious Temple, built untothe name of the Most High God ^East of us upon the Logan Bench^, andwhile you stand in the tower of that Templeand your eyes survey this glorious valley,filled with cities and villages, occupiedby tens of thousands of the Latter-day Saints, youwill then call to mind this visitationof President Young and his company.You will say 'Tthat was in the day whenPresidents Benson and Maughan presidedover us that was the day when PresidentYoung and the Apostles were with us—thatwas before New York was destroyed by an earthquake; it was before Boston wasswept into the sea by the sea heavingitself beyond its bounds; it was beforeAlbany was destroyed by fire; yea; atthat time you will remember the scenesof this day, treasure them up and forgetthem not."

The emigrating brethrencall upon me by day and the Sunset brethren inthe evening and we talk together and councilupon the things of the Kingdom. And I am as hap-py as any old bachelor can be and I think rathermore so, for when I kneel down to pray I rememberthat I once did have some wives and children inUtah and think I still have whose prayers ascendup to g^G^od for one. When I return from a journeythe little boys and girls of the fort run to me toshake hands with me and are as glad to see meas though I was their father, and if the littlefellows have any difficulty they run to me to settleit for them thinking that Bro Allen can makeeverything right.

 Dear brother Woodruff:I received your letter of Jany.174th, and I can assure you that it was a greattreat to me. The news from the valley is reallyglorious: The Lord is truly favoring Zion. I shouldhavinge written to you more frequently, but I have beentoo busy to write. I expect to take the Steamer in thefore part of March for Halifax and Boston. I am un-certain as to the day of leaving Liverpool, but I thinke thereis a steamer which leaves on the 9th of March. Ishall probably see you in Boston as I pass through. I willbring the I eleventh vol. of the Star for you including thepamphlets—the ninth and tenth volumes are not complete Some nos. are lacking. I think Elder Orson Spencertook the ninth and tenth volums bound for you. I am glad to hear that you are going to getall the saints you can out from the U. S. thatthe book of Mormon may be fulfilled and thatthe just judgments of heaven may not be stayedfrom that guilty nation. I expect to get back againto England in July. I feel very anxious to see the gospel preached to all nations, and to labor withmy might until it is done. Therefore I cannot thinkof spending much time in America.

 The Board will award about 260 dollars,in 20 premiums, for cotton, varying from 30 toabout 5 dollars each, on fields varying from halfan acre to ten acres each; also about 90 dollarsas preminum for tobacco, and about 50 dollars fordye-stuffs.We forward with this, a number of circularsof the Board, from which you will see the recom-mendation of the parent society, of the organizationof branch societies. It is our wish that you or-ganize a society in your county. The Com-mittee to make the award or premiums willbe chosen from among yourselves.We request the bishops, their counsel-ors, teachers, and all the Elders, to use their influ-ence and exertions to lay the foundation for theclothing of Israel with garments of their ownmake, as a religious duty, as well as a meas-ure of political economy, public policy, andabsolute necessity for the benefit of the kingdomof God.You have doubtless the best climate inthe Territory for the production of fruit, especiallythe culture of the grape.

 Cambridgeport Mass Febuary 15 AD 1849To the Historian of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.Dear Brother Richards, I forward to you as you are the Historian of the Church, A file of ^the^ the New York weekly Herrald, with this communition. I have sent some to you and President Youngby Elder Rockwood & others, & will continue to send as often Ias I have an opportunity. From the Herrald, you will draw an idea of the signs of the times throughout the word since you leftthe States. Elder Appleby has kept a record of affairs as they have transpired during the pastseason for the benefit of the Church which He may forward to you soon. I have also watchedthe signs, And occasionally made an Extract in my Journal, & on the first day of January 18489I recorded A summary or synopsis of the same, A portion of which I will forward in this communiac-ation to you: As it may in some measure be interesting to have A view of things, As they are passing in Great Babylon, which is separated from you by the sage deserts, And High Mountains of Israel."Thus ends the year of eighteen hundred and forty Eight. A Year big with with Events. A year in which the fig treees tree hath rapidly put forth her leaves and blossomed for the summer. A yearwhich has laid the foundation for the fulfillment of more prophecy & Revelation than wholecentauries in other ages. Thrones have been cast down, whole kingdoms overturned, And the Power of the Pope of Rome laid prostrate, and He driven from his kingdom. All the Nations ofthe Earth convulsed. Revolutions, wars, Anarchy, & confusion have followed each other in rapidsuccession. Cholera, plagues, fire and famine followed in the train. And last of all though not leastin importance is the foundation laid for the disolution of the Amarican Goverment. Whilethese theings are going on, The Ottoman Empire with many of the Nations of the East have come to the conclusion that the Jews are human beings, and are now saying to them, you may nowgo home, And rebuild Jerrusalem and your Temple and we will help you. These are some of the leading features of the signs of the times of Eighteen hundred forty Eight.The revolutions of Europe commenced with France. The people rose in mass, had three days fightat the end of which they drove Louis Philipi King of the French out of the kingdom with all theRoyal family. The people entered the Turrelles, took the Throne upon their shoulders, carried it intothe streets, and dashed it to peaces upon the ground. The people then undertook to Esstablish a Republican Goverment. It was said there were ownly 500 killed the first three days fight,afterwords A reaction took place when it was reported that some 15000 were killed. They have since organized, And Louis Napoleon Bonaparte is now President of France. The Jermanstates and Prusia next followed in Revolution, which still remians unsettled. Although the King of Prusia has called A constitutional Goverment. Next the Kingdom of Austriaarose in mass, drove the Emperor from his Throne & kingdom. He afterwards returnedraised armies, & bombarded Vienna eight days. Bloodshed continued untill the EmperorAbdicated his Throne. The Emperor of Russia has also had wars & difficulties in 
 God-father of a number of them if blessing themwould make me so. On sunday morning after ourreturn I was called upon by Bro Lot Smithto bless a fine son of his 10 days old, born to himin our absence by his wife Alice Ann Richards Smithweighing 11 lbs when born. I sealed upon him thename of Wilford Woodruff by request of his father.I hope these babies may live and make better menthan their namesake. I have had a good deal oftime to read, meditate, and pray since I have beenon this mission. I have read the Bible, Book ofMormon, Doctrines & Covenants since being herebesides the Hystory of France & England & McCabesHystory of the World, Blair's Lectures on Rhetoricand Belles Lettres and other works. I have read agood deal more than I can remember or havedigested, but I have found the Sacred books veryprofitable to me. I could hardly have believedthat I could have been as contented as I have beenon this mission. I have had nothing else to do butto try to do good, preach the gospel, strengthen theSaints, to visit the Lamanites and try to buildup Zion. I have had no desire for gold, Silverproperty on speculation. I have had no use formoney, occasionally somebody would give me 2or 3 dollars, I would give it away the first charit-able chance I had. All my wants have beensupplied. The Saints would take no money fromme for anything done for me. Bro Lot Smith hassupplied me with all the clothing I have wantedreward and why should not I be contented andhappy under the circumstances in which I havebeen placed. Among other blessings I have had agood Sister McNeil ready to come at my call to offici-ate as my scribe or copyist and I think there is greatnecessity for this for I think sometimes I have mur-dered more paper than any man living on earthof my age. And if it was all put into one volumesin a readable form it would be the largest book everproduced and the greates variety of succotash andthe world might call it the greatest romancebut enough upon this subject strain.

 his dominions, untill he has in many intstances been under necessity of yielding to thewishes of the people untill his Throne has been in danger. The Irish have made A struggleto throw off the British Yokke Yoke, but they have failed in it. Yet their is trouble brewingfor the British Goverment. The Roman Empire have risen up in their strength, And compelledthe Pope to make change after change, And at last have dashed his power to the Earth, Assassin-ated his counsellors, And driven him from his Papal seat & Throne, which has never befor beenvacated for more than one thousand years. And He has had to seek protection by flexingfleeing to other Nations. The world are ready to cry out that it is strange indeed that republican-ism is about to plant ists standard at the seat of the Mother of Abominations, the head ofRome. The Nations of the Earth at the same time are begining ^to say^ to the despised Jew, outcast &down trodden for Eighteen centuries you, too, are at last discovered to be a man—with the commonElements of Humanity—you, too must be free, you may not ownly enjoy the rights of citizenshipbut you may return home to the land of Judea, rebuild Jerrusalem, And lay the foundation of your Temple once more, more glorious than at the begining. "This sentiment has the past yearfor the first been formerly recognized not ownly by the Sultan but by nearly all the greatpowers, including the English, Russian, & Italian." One glorious feature in the Revolutions of Europe & the signs of the times is that it is dashing in peaces & breaking asunder all bars &petitions against the introduction of the proclamtion of the gospel of Jesus Christ toall the world. Go forth, now ye Elders of Israel, and make A proclamation of "this gospel ofthe Kingdom to Evry nation, kingdom, tounge, & people, under the whole Heaven as A witnessunto them that the End may come" I judge from A letter written by Elder Orson Spencerthat some from England are preparing to improve the present opportunity of spreading thegospel to those Nations. He says "There will soon be some vary Effecient preaches in theFrench Nations. We also have A learned Hindo in this country that speaks more thanA dozen different languages Arabic &c who is preparing to go to Asia to preach thegospel soon." While these things are going on in the East yet as for a moment turn our thoughtsto the Position of Blood stained America. A Nation though Blessed above all other Nations underHeaven, yet she has of late been guilty of sheding the blood of Apostles, Prophets, Patriarchs, and Saints.she has sufferd mob rule, to take the place of constitution law and order, and what positiondo we find her in at the close of this year. Not ownly one of her states, Ohio has disgracedherself by sitting having a legislator sit for weeks and spend their time fighting for the masteryinstead of doing the business of the People. But the leaders of the whole Nation at Washingtonare engendering the spirit of Party strife, hatred, disunion & war, meeting in separate partiesand laying plans for the dissolving of the Union and the Annihilation of the American GovernmentAnd James Gordon Bennett of the New York Herrald, And other Editors after Prophesying monthafter month that there was no dangers of dissolving the Union, are with all there prophesiesrecorded in their paper staring them in their face, under the neccessity of recording the accountof the parties, ways, And means, made use of to accomplis And bring to pass the vary things they had 
 I occassionally feel a desire to be with my Quorumin Salt Lake City in their Prayer circles, and to occupya seat with them in the Tabernacle and join themin bearing record and testimony of the Kingdom ofGod and warning the people of that which is tocome. Then again I reflect and understand that thereare already more Apostles in Salt Lake who are liftingup their voices and declairing the word of the Lordunto both Saints & Sinners than they will listen towith in faith and carry out their counsel and I fearthis is the case with many who profess to be SaintsThe year 1880 is ushered in with a strong determinat-ion of our Government to make war upon the Saintsand Kingdom of God, but they will prevail nofarther than the Lord permits. They are in Hishands as well as we are. And the warfare is betweenGod and the Nation and He will prevail.When the Elders in Ohio in 1831 called upon the Lord to stay His hand in Judgment upon theNation, the Lord informed them He could notdeny His word, but exhorted the Elders to

It is our wish that you or-ganize a society in your county. The Com-mittee to make the award or premiums willbe chosen from among yourselves.We request the bishops, their counsel-ors, teachers, and all the Elders, to use their influ-ence and exertions to lay the foundation for theclothing of Israel with garments of their ownmake, as a religious duty, as well as a meas-ure of political economy, public policy, andabsolute necessity for the benefit of the kingdomof God.You have doubtless the best climate inthe Territory for the production of fruit, especiallythe culture of the grape.

 labor faithfully and prune the vineyard for thelast time. The 166 & 167 pages of the D.C. as wellas the 45 section as well as other revelations showwhat the Lord intends doing and He will notdeny His Word in these instances than in theformer. As a people we should trust in God andexercise faith in His word. I feel that BroCannon has a hard warfare during this Sessionof Congress and needs the faith, prayers andsupport of all the Saints.It is a general timeof health with the people of this country. I havejust heard from a letter from Farmington, thatBro Thomas Smith was appointed to take 100or 150 families and start in March to come toSt John. I have just been conversing with BpFreeman and Lot Smith who came through inFebruary. They think Feb. would be a bettermonth than March to cross the Sevier countryand Buckskin Mountains. They think inMarch it is more stormy and roads breaking upthan Feb. and if they put it off much later 
 been prophesying against. And while the senators & statesmen from the slaves states meetin convention and resolve, that if slavery is Abolished or prohibited in the District of Columbiaor the Territories of New Mexico or Calafornia, that they will immediately dissolve theUnion, ^&^ lay taxes upon the shipping of the free states. At the same time citizens & statesman ofthe free states meet in convention, And Resolve that if those things are not donethat they will dissolve the Union. While these parties are growing more & moredetermined & further & wider Apart, still the public mind seem to be blinded as to the result of these resolutions, And seem ignorant concerning the fruit which will be producedfrom the seed of their own sowing. yes they have eyes but see not, ears but hear not, &hearts but do not understand, while the servants, of God filled with inspiration, can beholdthe scene in its true light, And comprehends the result with as much certainty as didNoah, Lot, & Jesus, each in their day while beholding the conduct of the Antedolouvi-ans, Sodom & Gomorrow, or the inhabitants of Jerruselem. And as the words of the Lordwere fulfilled in the former case, in like manner will they be in the latter. During thepast year the Asiatic Cholera one of the plagues of the last days has again made its appe-arance throughout Europe slaying its tens of thousands. It has Appeared through England& Scotland, And just Arived in America. It is in New York, New Orleans, Mobeal, MemphisCincinnati, Pittsburg, and nearly all the towns on the Missiissippi River the last accountssay about 100 deaths daily in New Orleans. Crime of evry kind has apparently increased throughoutthe United States during the past year, 100 per cent, it appears as though the cup of theiriniquity was full, And the hour of their judgment had come, And that calamity, confusion sorrowAnd Death had recieved their commission to visit this land, And in some instances the hearts of manare begining to fail them for fear of those things coming on the Earth. And their cry is that an awfuluncertainty is resting upon all things. I cannot close my Record upon the signs of the times of 1848without turning my eye towards Zion, yes Zion, which is not now merely a phantom of the brain or aname, but actually a living thing, truly she is yet but a babe, just born, yet she has a tabernacle, the mountainsof Israel, her bed is in the chamber of the rocks, her garden one of the rich gard valleys of Ephraim.She speaks; And her vioice is as the voice of GOD. She has A spirit which burns likes flames of fireshe has power, and has started a little stone a rolling ^from the mountain her habitation^ which increases as it goes, it is causing the Earthto quake & tremble, take care ye nations it will grind you to dust. She has messangers which go & comeat her bidding, one of them can chase a thousand, & two put ten thousand to flight, they commandthe Elements & they obey them. She has an Ensign for the Nations to flee to, she has A lawwhich will soon govern the Earth. She is born in the generation that David had a view of.O Praise the Lord I am a witness that mine Eyes have beheld her. She has keys to open, And no mancan shut, or shut & no man can open. Her power is from Heaven, whare she has noble senatorswho plead her cause both day & night. This is the Zion I seek after, this is the Zion I speak off. Her Churchis the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. Her city was sought out in 1847. And the Lordhas favored her from that time, And during the year 1848 the Church has been organized with 
 than this that they will hardly have time toput in spring crops, the companies who come inthe spring should make some arrangements tobring breadstuff with them, but if there couldbe arrangements so that flour could be collectedat Kanab it would be better than to haul itfrom Northern Utah. Another thing I want toname, those who are coming expecting to pay forland, if they could bring money instead of stock. I think it would be better for there is such a loss ofstock in driving them it would be better andmuch less money trouble to bring money than stockAnd the men we bought St John of said ^if^ they couldget all the money down they would take $10 ahead instead of the cows but they will take cowsat any time I think from $13 to $15 a headI think those who have money should bring itinstead of stock.

 a first Presidency of three persons viz. Brigham Young, Heber C Kimball, & Willard Richards,who have gatherd to the Mountains of Israel in the valleys of the Great Salt Lake, Great BasinNorth America, And taken with them some three thousand saints, with there flocks & herdswhich makes A population of about seven thousands souls in the City of the Great Salt Lake.The Lord has also blest their land which has brought forth in Abundance. And while ^the^ Lord has^been^ multiplying blessing upon Zion in her quiet habitation, Her messengers have been crying aloud to theNations of the Earth & the Isles of the sea, preaching the gospel unto the & uttering their testimonyin the power of God & the gift of the Holy Ghost, untill they have gatherd their thousandstogether, untill one of the Twelve Apostles of the Lamb, (Orson Pratt), Estimates that it will takethree hundred ships to remove the saints from the British Isles alone to the land of Zion.The saints who were gathered in the valley of the Sacramento, have discoverd such vast mines ofgold, silver, copper & other precious ores that the report of it is creating great excitement throughoutthe world, Esspecially in the United States, untill tens of thousands are rushing to the gold regions to tryto obtain the precious mettal. And as the hand of God has been so visible in all the signs of 1848, mayHe continue his work through 1849, and All following years, untill His Arm shall be made barein the eyes of all Nations, untill Zion shall shall arive to her full strength of Manhood. "for Brassmay she have gold, for Iron silver, for wood Brass, & for stones Iron, may her Exacters & peace officersbe rightous men, may her Nobles be of Ephriam & Her Governoorr procede out of the midst of him. may allof her messengers be armed with righteousness in the power of God in great glory. May all the Nationsof the Earth fear & tremble because of her Law, may the wicked find her sons terrible when theygo to Battle against her & not have power to stand before them. May her dwelling places be disting-uished by A pillar of fire by night And A cloud by day, And in fine may she arise and shine forthAnd spread Herself abroad with all that perfection of beauty, power and glory which has everbeen spoken concerning her, even to the full Expectation of GOD, Angels, and Men.Wilford WoodruffAmong the signs of the last days I will name that there has of late been a shower of living worm foundon the top of the snow about one inch in length in many parts of the Eastern states, it is spoken offin a Number of the papers.

 Bro Taylor, there is another subject I wishto say a few words upon (although it is against thewish of Bro Lot Smith) it is this, Sunset, BrighamCity, and St Joseph who live in the United Orderhave been verry zealous to sustain the Z.C.M.I. inSalt Lake in all their purchases but they havebeen the most unfortunate of human beings in alltheir deal with that Institution, especially in allMachinery. Bro Smith sent money to buy the bestthreshing machine in market, sent to R Burton &E. F. Sheets to help pick it out, it was put intoHiram Clawsons hands and he sent an oldWhitmans threshing machine that he had hadon hand a long time and could not sell to anybody else, and it was freighted down here toSunset 700 miles and as soon as it was opened itwould have been taken back if it had not beenmore than 300 miles. it has been a curse to themever since it was brought here, in spite of allthey can do it wastes grain and only can thresh 
 from 200 to 300 Bushels a day with the best ofattention, and all three of these settlements haveto depend on it to thresh their wheat. it is now brok-en down so that it cannot be be used at alluntil a pinion wheel is sent from St. Louis orZ.C.M.I. Bro Smith has sent to both places forme. He sent for a bill of goods to the Co-op.when it came to Sunset it all came in one boxIndigo, Alum, Logwood Madder, slates, pencils,school books &c, all mixed ^together^ in one compound. Therehas been something wrong with almost every pieceof machinery sent for, last spring they sent to Z.C.M.I. for a two horse large sized Molasses canemill. It was put into the hands of H Clawsonwho sent a small one horse mill with some partsmissing when it arrived. It was entirely toosmall for their use and last of all though notleast they wanted to start a tannery had theirvats in place and tanner and materials allon hand, they wanted a bark mill and sentmoney by Bro Flake and when he arrivedat Beaver he not going to Salt Lake requestedthe Beaver Co-op. who is dealing with the ZC.M.I. to send for a bark mill for the SunsetTannery, Bro Smith had to send on extrateam to the ferry to bring it but when it arrivedbehold! and Lo! it turned out to be a littlegiant, a corn-cob mill and not suitablefor grinding bark at all, now all has to waituntil a bak^r^k mill can be bought at StLouis, brought to the terminns by rail andthen freighted from there by way of Albuquer-que. Now is not this enough to try the patienceof Saints,? to say nothing about sinners, I thinkit is. I think that persons living as far fromSalt Lake as these settlements are who wish topatronize their own Institutions and paydown should have a little care and painstaken for them and not make such blundersas have been made towards them. The peopleof this country do not think that Bro Clawsonhas done them justice. They did not know

 L. D. S. Historian's Office,P. O. BOX 321,Salt Lake City, Utah, 24 Sep. 1886better, especially yours.I thought I would take the first oppor-tunity to notify you that I was in thecounty, so that if there was any itemof business of any kind that I could per-form of any interest to the kingdom of God while here I wish to do it. I camevery quietly through the count^r^y. Noneknow of my coming, except a fewsafe individuals where we stopped.The Temple opened again on the 15th.Now, dear brethren, I want tolay before you my feelings. I have neverfelt better in my life, in spirit, than to-day.I have been blessed, as you have, with bodilyhealth and strength to a good old age.We have both been preserved in life while theprophets and apostles and thousands of theSaints have been called into the spirit world,for the Lord has taken whom he would take,and preserved in life whom he would preserve.I have been trying to get ready when calledto go. As to the infirmities of the body, Iexpect them, I have them. As to the infirm- 
 ities of the spirit, I would to God I had less ofthem. I wish I had been a better man anddone more good. But notwithstanding allthe imperfections of my nature, I rejoice inGod. I am thankful that I live in this dayand generation, that I have received theGospel and the priesthood, and that theSpirit of God is still with me and mycompanions. The hand of God is beforeme and visible to my eye in the great workof this last dispensation to all the inhabi-tants of this world. Yea, the God of Israelwill teach this nation, with its congress-men and rulers, the governors, judges,and marshals, and all men, that Heis stronger than man, that His purposesfail not, that He is able to perform allthat He has set His hand to do, and thathe will perform it and bring it to passin spite of earth or hell, or wicked men ordevils, and none can stay his hand. Inthis I rejoice. We have nothing to discourageus, so far as the Church and Kingdomof God are concerned in their final triumph.Of course we are called to mourn for sinand transgression, whether in the churchor out of it. This warfare is withGod and the Heavenly hosts on one side, 
 L. D. S. Historian's Office,P. O. BOX 321,Salt Lake City, Utah, 24 Sep 1886and the fallen angels and the earth beneathon the other. The devil is ruling over hiskingdom and is making a desperate strug-gle to overcome the kingdom of God andits Christ. But they cannot prevail.Here is the patience and faith of the Saintsand they that keep the commandments of Godand the testimony of Jesus. It certainly isbeginning to be a trying time to theSaints of God. But if we had no trials,in our day, of our faith, we would hardlybe at home with the ancient Saints,who were persecuted and martyred for theword of God and the testimony of JesusChrist. Whatever weakness we may haveas pertaining to our flesh, we certainly oughtnot to be afraid to lay down our lives for theGospel's sake if required, and I hope andpray that we may all be prepared forwhatever afflictions the Lord has ordainedus to pass through.I have been asked a number of timesif I could tell where the October Conferencewould be held. I have answered that I 
 presumed the public would be notified throughthe proper channel, and from the proper source.Brethren, I don't know that I haveany counsel to give. I know there is a deepanxiety throughout the public mind of theSaints for your safety. But I thoroughlybelieve the Lord will reveal to you yourduty, and what course to pursue for yourown safety. I have had some very unpleas-ant dreams concerning my own safety,of being in the hands of my enemies.But they may have been as a warningof caution, as I have escaped so far.I received a letter from B. Y. Duffin,in Arizona with Brother Brigham Young,on the Lamanite Mission, and thingswere brightening up much there now.A letter from G. Teasdale, of Chihuahua,gives a history of affairs there, the purchase,land, water, etc., and said all were doingas well as could be expected; but of courseyou have been made acquainted with allthose affairs by Brothers Snow and Prestonand others who have written.You are under the protection andwatch care of God our heavenly father, andyou have the prayers of all the faith-ful Saints of God.

My plan isto purchase as many books on the subject of genealogy, or relatingthereto, as I can, and in time collect a good library of such works.In connection with this library I would conduct an agency or bureauthrough which the Saints who might desire to patronize it might obtainthe records of their ancestry.I already have a library of genealogical works which has cost sev-eral hundred dollars, and which comprises a good foundation for sucha one as I would like to collect. Brother D. J. Williams of the Fif-teenth Ward, who is my brother-in-law, is interested in the plan withme, and if agreeable to you he will go east shortly to purchase books,and search records for a number of families who desire their ancestrytraced.My own time in^s^ pretty well occupied with my labors on the "News,"and it is my desire to at once relieve myself and put the library Ihave already collected to the best use, by employing him, and perhapsothers, to do the work of compiling genealogies which is steadilygrowing on my hands, and has necessitated my working late evenings,

I and my family em-igrated from England to this Cityone year ago and during that timeI have been very unfortunite inobtaining employment. I am a Mechinest and have a first classEnglish Certificate for Engineering. Ihave worked at several mechine shopshere and also anything whichmy hands have found to do. Butsomehow every thing seem's tooppose me and against mewhat ever I undertake to do. 
 much of the time during the last year. I have applications to do workfor many families which I cannot entertain at all, but I think theplan I have suggested would open the way for hundreds of families ofSaints to obtain their genealogies.I have acquired a knowledge of and experience in this work whichwould enable me to exercise a general supervision over such a libraryand agency as I have suggested, without occupying much of my time; andwhile I am very much interested in my work on the "News" and desirethat nothing else shall interfere with it, I have felt strongly im-pressed that I ought not to abandon the work of gathering the recordsof the dead. Indeed, I amm scarcely able to resist the requests thatare made of me to trace genealogies, so urgent^ly^ are some of them pre-sented, and so great is my own interest in the work.Both Brother Williams and myself desire to be governed entirely byyour counsel, but if the foregoing suggestions meet your approval, wewill proceed at once to carry them out.Your brother,B.

 GEMS OF TRUTH.By B. E. Rich.Baptism.DEAR reader, have you truly repented of every sin? Is your heart humble and your spirit contrite? Do you desire to be baptized for the remission of sins? If so, seek after a man of God who has been truly called and or-dained unto the authority which God hath again restored by the ministering of holy angels; and when you have found such an one who has authority from heaven to baptize, go with him into the water and he will baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost; and then your sins shall be remitted on the earth, and the blessings shall be sealed in the heavens; and then you shall also be baptized with fire and the Holy Ghost.ORSON PRATT,Tract on Water Baptism, p. 48.A Saul might hear the voice of the Lord from heaven [##Acts 9:3-6##] or a Cornelius be blessed with the ministration of a holy angel; [##Acts 10:1-7##] but, though they had been thus favored, to fulfill and comply with all the requirements of the Lord, it was necessary for them to be baptized to obtain remission of sins, that they might becomethe recipients of the Holy Ghost through the ordinance of thelaying on of hands, and be enabled to walk in newness of life. If they had not complied with this requirement, they would not have been in a suitable condition to have entered into the kingdom of God.GEO. Q. CANNON,Western Standard p. 162.We want to sacrifice enough to do the will of God in prepar-ing to bring up those who have not had the privilege of hear-ing the gospel while in the flesh, for the simple reason that, in the spirit world, they cannot officiate in the ordinances of the house of God. They have passed the ordeals, and are beyond the possibility of personally officiating for the remission of their sins and for their exaltation, consequently they are under the necessity of trusting in their friends, their children and their children's children to officiate for them, that they may be brought up into the celestial kingdom of God.BRIGHAM YOUNG,Journal of Discourses, vol. xviii. p. 238.It is not in the power of any man or angel to find a license in the Bible to receive a person into the kingdom of God with- out baptism. Jesus Christ has never given any license, but on the other hand, He has explicitly said, in the most unequivo-cal language possible, that NO MAN can "enter the kingdom" without water baptism, or being "born of the water." [##John 3:5##]ORSON SPENCER, Spencer's Letters, p 50.The conditions of salvation from death, hell and the grave, are faith in God, in Jesus Christ, and in the atonement; re-pentance, reformation, and a godly life; baptism by immer-sion for the remission of sins administered by divine authority, the sanctifying effects of the blood of Christ that follows the water, and the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands by properly ordained ministers. These conditions are as essential to salvation in the kingdom of heaven to-day, as they were in the days when Christ and His apostles and elders declared them nearly nineteen hundred years ago. The same authority has been restored to the earth. The same apostle-ship and keys of priesthood, with power to officiate in the ordinances of the house of God, are again restored to earth, and the gospel of God is being preached in all nations for a witness. The same signs follow the believers according to their faith, obedience, and the will of God. The same unction from the Holy One is enjoyed by the Saints, and gives them a living testimony that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, and Joseph Smith His servant, ordained to usher in the dispensa-tion of the fullness of times. God has revealed these precious truths to the Elders and Saints of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and they know they are living in the last days. Consequently He requires His people whom He hath redeemed, and unto whom He hath made the Scriptures plain, to live perfect lives, and to do His will on earth as it is done in heaven.B. H. ROBERTS,Mill. Star, vol. 1. p. 296.Many have looked upon baptism as merely "an outward sign of an inward grace;" but this is one of the uninspired precepts of man, and is not a Bible doctrine; instead of bap-tism's being the "sign of an inward grace," it is the ordinance through which the believing penitent obtains a remission of sins which justifies and prepares the heart for the reception "of an inward grace." Remission of sins, and "an inward grace," do not precede baptism, but follow it.The numerous multitudes that came to John were not bap-tized in Jordan, because they had previously received forgive-ness and "an inward grace;" but they came confessing their sins and were baptized for the remission of them. [##Mark 1:4-5##]ORSON PRATT,Tract on Water Baptism, p. 43.Jesus told Nicodemus that "except a man be born of water, and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God." [##John 3:5##]An entrance into the kingdom of God, then, cannot be obtained by a man who has not been born of water and of the Spirit. Neither sincerity nor morality will avail, except these essential ordinances have been attended to. Though the Lord is full of mercy and love for His creatures, yet His justice and truth would not permit so flagrant a violation of His laws, as the neglect of these ordinances would be, to pass unpunished; much less would He break His own word, where He says that the man who does not attend to these requirements can-not enter into His kingdom, by admitting them therein.GEO. Q. CANNON, Western Standard p. 403.The necessity of baptism must be understood. It is taught by some that the observance of this ordinance is optional on the part of the candidate for celestial glory. This is danger-ous doctrine. There is no authority for it in the scriptures. Jesus and His apostles never taught it. It is contrary to their teachings. Jesus never included a non-essential principle in the great plan of salvation. Had not baptism been necessary, He would not have said to His apostles: "He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved." [##Mark 16:16##]WM. JEFFERIES, Tract, "The Gospel Pioneer," p. 15.Whatever an over-jealous mind may fear concerning the state of the penitent thief on the cross, and of devout and upright men that have lived and died in every age of the world, still let God's word be accounted true, and every man that gainsays it be esteemed a liar! No man ever put on the uniform of Christ's followers, such as is worn by subjects of the kingdom of Christ, until he is "baptized into Christ" for the remission of sins. Hereby he "puts on Christ." [##Romans 13:14##]ORSON SPENCER, Spencer's Letters, p. 49.

 LESSONS ON HEALTH.BY E. F. P.CHAPTER VI—DAILY OCCUPATIONS.PEOPLE are employed in so many different branches oflabor, and occupy their time in such various ways thatonly a few suggestions which will apply to them generally willbe given here.If one's occupation causes him to perspire, or "sweat"freely he should be careful to not cool his body too suddenlyby going from a warm room to a cold place, and there remain-ing till his body is chilled. He should also use caution indrinking cold water. When a person is warm and thirsty heis very liable to drink too much at a time. Ice-water in warmweather is not the proper drink for anyone, and should not beused if avoidable.During the daytime one should try and make it convenientto stand up part of the time and sit down another part. Toomuch sitting or standing is likely to be injurious. While sit-ting, standing or walking, keep the body erect, with the shoul-ders thrown back, so the lungs will not be cramped, andto prevent consumption.A beauty of nature is that the more graceful one's actionsare the more they tend to health and comfort. By keepingthe body upright, by closing the mouth when not in use, byavoiding too much boistersous laughter, by appearing cheerful,pleasant and good-natured, and by keeping our temper we canenjoy better health than we can otherwise; so that the rulesof deportment which are calculated to make us agreeable toour associates will also often prove good to preserve health.If during the day, especially in cold seasons, you shouldhappen to get your clothing dampened through being exposedin a rainstorm or by any other means, all wet garments shouldbe removed as soon as possible, as they will endanger thehealth if left to dry upon the body. The feet should be keptdry and warm by having them properly clothed. When rub-ber overshoes or boots are used in wet weather they should beremoved from the feet when not needed to keep off the damp-ness, as they are apt to prove an injury to the feet if this isnot done. The clothing on one's body should never be tooclose-fitting or tight, neither in warm nor cold weather. Besidesbeing uncomfortable such clothing is ruinous to health. Theshape of the body is naturally graceful, and it cannot be im-proved by any distortions caused by wearing tight-fittingclothes. The clothing of the body should be suspended, asmuch as possible or practicable from the shoulders. Nothingshould be worn that will hinder the free circulation of theblood, or that will crush any of the physical organs out of theirproper positions.The covering for the head should not be for keeping it warmparticularly. A young person who has not lost his hair needsno artificial covering for that purpose; and the head should bekept bare as much as possisble while indoors. This will helpto keep one from becoming bald.A reasonable amount of hard labor is beneficial to health;and no one should be afraid of it, since the Lord has ordainedthat man should earn his bread by the sweat of his brow.It is very seldom that people hurt themselves by too muchwork. Having too many things to attend to, and worryingover them, or an over-amount of mental work with insufficientphysical exercise, is indeed injurious. Persons should seek toregulate their affairs so as to avoid such conditions.The proper observance of the Sabbath day should be care-fully attended to as the Lord commanded. This day has beenset apart as a day of rest; and it is of vital importance thatthe body should not be robbed of that rest which it requires.There is nothing that would be of more benefit to our physicaland mental organization than a relief once a week from thecares and anxieties of our every-day occupations and studies.No one should deceive himself with the idea that anythingis to be gained by laboring on the Sabbath as well as duringthe rest of the week. The system requires a certain amountof rest, and if it does not receive it regularly as it should, wewill have to yield to its demands sooner or later. If we refuseto give our bodies an opportunity to get renewed vigor by afrequent relaxation from the constant strain upon them, ourconstitutions will eventually break down; and we will at last becompelled to take time to allow them to gain strength. Bygoing to pleasure resorts, or indulging in sports of differentkinds, will not answer any purpose for which the Sabbath wasintended. There is more or less excitement attending suchrecreations, and the mind and body are not so perfectly at restas when one calmly observes the Sabbath as the Lord intendedit should be, and that is by attending public worship, partakingof the sacrament and offering up our praise and thanksgivingto Him, and by seeking to learn such things that are for ourspiritual welfare, to be nourished with spiritual food; so thatthe Sabbath was ordained to be unto man not only a spiritualbut a temporal blessing as well. It is apparent that there isa two-fold object in every requirement the Lord makes of Hispeople, and there is also a double blessing attending theobedience to that requirement.THE TWO SIDES.(Concluded from page 197.)SCENE III.Same Room.Mrs. N.

 American Fork, Utah County, UtahMay the 17th 1889.To the most venerablePresident Wilford WoodruffSalt-Lake-City.Dear President and Brother!Through the grace of our Lord and Saviour Jesus theChrist, I have, in obedience to your call, beenpermitted to finish the translation of the holybook of Mormon into the Jewish language.How far I have succeded in making the transla-tion a correct one, it is not for me to say, butothers familiar with the language of the Jews willdecide upon. I feel that I have been aboundantlyblessed by the holy Ghost, while engaged in perfor-ming this glorios Work, and in my humble judge-ment I believe and declare it to be verbally cor-rect according to the reading in the english book,and I know that I am justified in saying, thatit sounds even sweeter in the language of the Jews,then in any other language with which I am familiarand into which the book has yet been translated.It has been a Work of love to me, and I neverset down to do it witout invoking the assistanceof the Spirit of the most high God, and todayI am happy to bear testimony that the Lord, theGod of my fathers Abraham Isaac and Jacob, hasaccepted of my prayers and blessed me in my Work.[FIGURE]

Perery & Judge Eldridge^ and others of their class, so that this book of biographies(or supplement) will embody a vast amount of the history oftheChurch, our foreign missions, our emigration and pioneer workbesides the building up of the cities and counties of Utah.This second vol of my Histories of Utah is nearly complete,but I am unable to finish it without help. Mr Cannon needs moneyof me to purchase paper for the remaining part. I have to acknow-ledge that Cannon & Sons have generously carried much of myburden. Moses Thatcher has also greatly helped me. Besidessteel plates, he at one time gave me three hundred dollars, and atanother time loaned me $300, which I still owe him, Lorenzoand further help from the Thatcher family and Bishop Preston.Lorenzo Snow has also helped me personally with $100, andalso urged his County to help me. Indeed, it is from such personalhelp, from these and numerous others, that I have been enabledto prosecute my costly work so far, rather than from appropriationsfrom Cities or Counties.Ogden City at the onset appropriated $1000, but aninjunction was put on it. Some of the citizens then agreed to raise$1000, but only six hundred were raised, mostly by the membersof the City Council and a few of the Ogden merchants, which,however, I returned to them in personal service and printersbills on their biographies and commercial interests; so that itwas no appropriation in any sense. As for Weber County,though it leads and claims the book, it has refused repeatedlyto help its own history, though ^notwithstanding^ my brother Franklin hasbeen solicitous for that help in my behalf. Altogether fromthese County and City appropriations, I have received about$2300, while the work has covered two years and halfof labor of myself and two assistants—Joseph Hall andJames A.

 five thousand dollars, in traveling over all these Counties gatheringand writing their history. For a year and a quarter I had BroJoseph Hall engaged at $100 per month, and all travellingand hotel expenses he are ^paid;^ and Elder James A. Little seven monthsat $75 and expenses. They were constantly from home traveling,collecting history and obtaining biographical matter, while I myselfhave been out most of the time of the last two and half yearson this same work; which, giving me even a small wage tosupport my family, and my expenses, apart from officersat home, ^this^ will show that I have spent from $5000 to 7000in making this book, which was ^has been^ far more costly andlaborious to make than the History of Salt Lake City; as that^book^ was a growth of years in my own hands ^and^ which was producedin my own closet; and Moreover I had a committee tohelp me in every way and to petition for me for extension oftime and further appropriations: to that Committee—Col. Winder,Gen R. T. Burton, Geo Reynolds George A Meears, and JudgeJonasen I owe much, while on this Northern History I havehad no such help, excepting in the personal help of those alreadynamed.To the cost of making this book as shown abovethere must be added the printers and binders and engraversbills (2000 vols of 1000 pages), giving a total of from tento fiften thousand dollars.Had I know at the onset that the Northerncities and counties would not have given me generoushelp by appropriations, following the example of Salt LakeCity, I would never have undertaken the work, forI knew by experience something of the labor and costof making large volumes of histories of a young nation,like our modern Israel with his colonizations all overthis western country, the record of which had to begathered and constructed into form.
