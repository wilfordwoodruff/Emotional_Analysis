Dear Sir: I trust the interest I take in the subject men- tioned will be an excuse sufficient for the liberty I take in thus addressing you. For several years I have read and studied every thing I could find relating to the Mormon church, its morale and its people, its origin and growth and prosperity, and with especial interest I have watched the various measures of Congress relating to the matter. I am forced to admit that there is something far above the ordinary in the teachings and practices of this people that has enabled them to spread and propogate their peculiar system so extensively and successfully, and to do this against poverty and the bitterest persecution, oppression and vituperation. Above all this, I admire this people for the great good they have wrought for our common country in redeeming the waste places in the desert and most abandoned sections of that country. They have done this, and spent millions of money, thousands of lives in conquering the savage, clearing the forests, clothing the desert plains and arid valley with fruitage, towns, cities, roads and other incident of civilization. All done seemingly in a spirit of self- denial, patience, fortitude and patriotism!  I have just finished reading a little book by Austin Phelp, "Our Country," in which he says, among many ENDENTRY feel to Excuse him, Please send him a letter to that Effect as he is very sensitive on such points  yours very truley Bp.

Mormonism is not simply a church, but a state; an 'imperium in imperio,' ruled by a man who is prophet, priest, king and pope, all in one." Howe's "Western America", 1852, V. II, that under authority from the Legislature of the state of Nauvoo passed an ordinance making it imprisonment for life for any person, with or without process, to attempt to arrest the Prophet for any offense growing out of the Missouri difficulties, also another ordinance making it penal to even a fine of $10000 and six months' imprisonment, for any officer to serve a process in Nauvoo without first securing the endorsed sig- nature of the Mayor thereon!! p. 340. I am unable to tell whether these and other similar and se- rious charges be true or not. I trust they are false, and that there is not the danger to American institutions and safety that modern prejudiced authors would have us believe.

Dear Brother Woodruff:  Your letter of the 8th inst. was duly rec'd. I am very much obliged to you for your trouble in sending the account of the meeting of the Board on Education.  In answering your enquiry whether or not it would be convenient for me to come to Salt Lake, in case you desired to hold an important meeting, I would say that it will not be practicable for me to go, until about November next. Major Jones, who has charge of a part of the Government improvements in Oregon and Washington Territory., has been granted a leave of absence for four months, beginning June 20th, and his works are all to be in my charge during his absence.  We are expecting the new River and Harbor bill to pass very soon now, and as soon as it does, I will be very busy ENDENTRY all round to older heads, as it has been openly expressed even by some Bishops and leading  men. And this partly is one reason why I take up the subject. I may say I have gone through the Book of Mormon twenty times to find out the Ge-o-graphical part of it. And I doubt the ab^i^lity of any man to get up a map and locate a city as its proper site. I have seen ^two^ maps gotten up and if my memery serves me right the two maps disagree. And further more the two maps disagree with the Book of Mormon its self for enstance if the city Jashon is placed on the map and located in south America, and the Book lo- cate it in North america, which is dos, these two do not agree. Again if Moroni's line of defence is placed on a map and located in south America, running from a given point nearly a north and south direction where it would take a Nephite many days to cross it. And the book say it was a days journey for a nephite to cross it, from sea to sea, there is a dis agreement, and the book say so. Now ENDENTRY centered in some place where I would do good to my sisters and at the same time center my efforts.  He further added that he should like to see me associated with Sister E. B. Wells in the labors of the Exponent publication. This was a very novel idea to me, as in all my hopes and aims for the future, no idea ^had ever occurred to me^ of actual partccipation in the editing of publishing of a paper or magazine. But the more I studied over the matter the more it seemed to open up before me. I had intended ^wished and hoped^ to use my talents ^to do good;^ or as Aunt Eliza Snow once affection- ately remarked to me, "never write a line or a word that is not calculated to help and benefit this Kingdom. But Heretofore however my aims were all individual ones; now a new thought was precented. At length I acted upon the suggestion of my husband, and by his advice addressed a private letter to Sister Romnaina B. Pratt who was an old and valued friend, and one who was conversant with matters pertain- ing to the interests of the R.S. and its organ the Exponent.

I should have about 20 days notice of an expected meeting, in order to enable me to get a leave in regular form. If this should not be practicable I might, possibly, start after one or two days notice, by using the telegraph, or by granting myself a weeks leave, which, under my present duties, I am permitted to do.  Regarding the plot of ground in the 18th Ward, held by the Board of Trustees of the Young Academy of Salt Lake, I would say that, as a member of the Board, and as an heir, I would be glad to have it utalized by the Board of Education, if it is possible.

But with my close study I could never place it in south America, from the fact, the condition as a wooded thicket as Alma found it as a resort to preach and baptize in in his day. And the condition as found, 280 years a go by two Franciscon Monks I am enduced to believe it to be located in what is now known as Guatimala. Alma says it was a place of pure water. the above Monks in 1608 went to preach to the indians that dwelt on an island in a very large Lake in Guatima- la and the indians sent them a way saying the time had not come for them to receive christianity And in after years the Spanish soldiers had to cut their way to this beautifull place of water and with their guns frighted the natives they took to the water and escaped to lands unknown, and the Monks with the soldies sent a shout of victory to the heavens and thanked God they had gained an island with out an inhabitant.

Here then was an entirely new suggestion. Upon reflection, my husband decided that if the Pres- idency of the Church, and the Authorities of and Members of the Y.L.M.I.A. felt to add thier co-operation and faith to such a scheme, he was willing I should undertake to fulfill a portion of that mission. Accordingly, I wrote a letter setting these matters forth to one who has been a friend and a brother to us, and whose counsel upon the matter would be dictated by the Spirit of the Lord, that brother was Pres Joseph F.

To begin with I desire to say that the  ordinance of washing and anointing is one that should  only be administered in Temples or other holy places  which are dedicated for the purpose of giving endow- ments to the Saints. That ordinance ought not to be administered to any one, whether she has received or  has not received her endowments, in any other place  or under any other circumstances.  But I imagine from your question  that you refer to a practice that has grown up among  the sisters of washing and anointing sisters who are  approaching their confinement. If so, this is not,  strictly speaking, an ordinance, unless it be done  under the direction of the priesthood and in con- nection with the ordinance of laying on of hands  for the restoration of the sick.

ENDENTRY Y, APRIL 10, 1887--SIX  PISGAH BURYING GROUND.  For the Preservation of a Sacred Historical Spot.  To the Editor of THE HERALD  Over two years ago, President John Taylor received a letter from a gentle- man owning the land at Pisgah, Iowa, where three hundred of the Saints were buried, in their exodus from Nauvoo to these mountains.  The gentleman. Mr. A. E. White, stated to President Taylor that he had never suffered the land to be plowed or disturbed, known there as the "old Mormon Burying Ground," and he wanted to know what the people here in Utah, who had friends buried there, wanted to do about the ground or the remains of their friends.  In his  letter, he made mention of the name of William Huntington, my father, as having been buried there, who was a Bishop or presiding officer of the settle- ment.  President Taylor sent Mr. White's letter to me with instructions what to do in the matter.  I have followed his in- structions, and to-day, through the blessings of God, and the kindness and humanity of Mr. White, the "Old Mor- mon Burying Ground" belongs to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  The lot of one acre is fenced with a good wire-netting fence, and this spring there will be a row of poplar trees set around the lot inside the fence.  It is now desired by many, in order to fully complete improvements upon the ground, that a monument of some kind, or a stone, should be placed in the center of the lot, whereon shall be en- graved the names of all persons buried there, so far as can be obtained.  This work will necessarily require money, which should be forwarded to me at Springville, Utah, as soon as possible, and I will forward the same to Mr. White, who has very kindly and gratuitously attended to all business matters pertaining to the ground which lies in the center of his farm.  The liberality of those interested in this matter will decide the kind and respectability of the object that will indicate the last resting place of their loved ones.  Will every person having relatives buried there forward the names of the  dead without delay, and as liberal donations as their circumstances will permit?  Every one should send as  much as will pay for engraving the names of their dead at least, and they that are well-to-do should send more, that the good work may be completed in a creditable manner.  When fully completed, a photograph of the ground will be sent to those most  liberal in donating.  OLIVER B. HUNTINGTON. SPRINGVILLE, Utah Co., Utah, March 30, 1887. ENDENTRY A.S.

As to your third question, “Is it the  proper thing for a sister to preside over a Relief So- ciety who has not yet received her endowments?” I would  naturally suppose that such a person would be rarely,  if ever, called to preside over a Relief Society; because  a woman who would be qualified for this, if married,  would certainly honor the ordinances of the Lord’s house  sufficiently to have her marriage solemnized in the  Temple, and she could not have this done without  receiving her endowments. Other cases, where a person  would not have had her endowments, would be that of  an unmarried woman, who, I suppose, is rarely called  to preside over a Relief Society.

Wells,  Editor “Woman’s Exponent.”  Dear Sister,  In a favor which havre received from you, under date of the 24th.  inst., you ask,  “First: Are sisters justified in miniestering the ordinacnce of  washing and annointing previous to confinements to those who have  received their endowments and have married men outside of the Church?”  “Second, Can anyone who has not had their endowments be thus  administered to by the sisters if she is a faithful saint in good  standing and has not yet had the opportunity of going to the Temple  for the ordinance?”  To begin with I desire to say that the ordinance of washing and  annointing is one that should only be administered in the Temple or  other holy places which are dedicated for the purpose of giving en- dowments to the Saints. That ordinance ought not to be administered  to any one, whetehrer she has received or has not received her endowments,  in any other place or under any other circumstances.  But I imagine from your question that you refer to a practise  that has grown up amoung the sisters of washing and annointing sisters  who are approaching their confinement. If so, this is not, strictly  speaking, an ordinance, unless it be done under the direction of the  priesthood and in connection with the ordinance of laying on of hands  for the restoration of the sick.  There is no impropriety in sisters washing and annointing their  sisters in this way, under the circumstances you describe; but it sho- uld understood that they do this, not as members of the priesthood,  but as members of the Church, exercising faith for, and asking the  blessings of the Lord upon, their sisters; just as they, and every  member of the Church might do in behalf of the members of their  families.
