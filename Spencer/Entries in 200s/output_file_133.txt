 There were present on the stand Prest W. Woodruffwho addressed the conference on the kind providence of God in giving the Saints such abundant crops. 
 Prest. W. Woodruff said, if we could have the privi-lege of looking behind the veil, we would notneed any sermons on Temple building; we wouldbe so eager to rear them understanding the greatnecessity of this work, just think there are 50generations waiting for us to do the work for them. 
 Prest. W. Woodruff compared this church to David who fought Goliath and like him we would come off victorious - 
 Prest W. Woodruff was pleased to see the saintsenjoy so many blessings. There is but one way of buildingup the Kingdom of God and that is by paying strictattention to the performance of our duties. 
 Prest. W. Woodruff said that the Lord had commencedthis work and he will see that it be victorious. 
 Prest. W W. Woodruff addressed the conferenceon our duty to be faithful in our covenantsand to be diligent in Temple building. TheSaints should not bear any feelings againstone another. God will overrule all for ourgood. 
 Prest W Woodruff said he had beenin the Church 50 years – related several incidentsof the conduct of the prophet Joseph – Borehis testimony that he was a true prophet. 
 Apostle Wilford Woodruff said he was pleasedto meet the Saints in conference. The Lord has sethis hand to gather Israel in fullfilment of prophecy, had been with the Church for fiftyyears, a little one has become an hundred and fiftythousand: The Lord has decreed he will raise upa righteous nation out of this people, yet we havea work to do, as the war between God and Satan willcontinue untill Christ comes. 
 Pres. Woodruff was much pleased to meet with the young peopleHe said they have a work before them that no other generation has ever had. Spoke of the responsibility that would in the near future rest upon the yong people, that they would have to bear of this Kingdom.  Singing and Benediction

Young sent me word to meet him at Snowflake as therewere some unsettled Sunset Matters.Now what on earth I have to do with them if there things unsettledconnected with that company I could not tell for the life of me, as yearssince I, as perhaps you will recollect, I turned over to receivers everydollar I had belonging to that Co. and positively declaired havinganything to do in the settlement of the business of the Company.But Bro. Snow instisted that I shold meet with the committee.I did so and they almost entirely ignored me in the business which wasmore pleasant to me than to have been a connected with it.I did know more about the business of the company than any personliving but NOW I positively know nothing and what I am trying to getat I want you to protect me so that I am moyed & perplexed tith thatdisagreeable matter, disagreeable to me because I am sure I was mostshamfully cheated in connection with it.Is this asking something something unjust or unfair?

 W. WoodruffJune 30 [18]80Salt Lake City, June 19, 1880.President Lot Smith, Sunset.Dear Brother—I received yourletter of June 7, and was glad tohear from you, but sorry to learn thatyou had let that colt kick you in theface. That is a trick that I thoughtyou never allowed your horses to do,but I suppose he being a colt had not learn-ed the lesson. I hope it will not be alasting injury to you. I am gladto learn that you had a good conference.I should certainly have been glad tohave been with you. You speakof the spring crops, etc. It seemsto me that winter has just broken here.We are now having hot weather. Ithas been so cold that corn could notgrow. It stands just on topof the ground, but it is now begin- 
 ning to grow.All crops are back-ward, but we have plenty of water.I am glad to hear your stock is doingwell, and to learn of a good start on thetannery, and that it is doing well. Iwanted to know how that bark milldid. I think you had a goodoffer for the fifty heifers, $20 each, butperhaps they will do you as much good as the money. Has yourmare Mary got a horse colt? Give mylove to my Indian friends when theyask about me. J. W. Y. said hehad baptized Tenney Comiaga's son(I want to say right here that I spokeat Provo on my Indian visit, and thereporter published it in the Territorial En-quirer without my seeing it, and itwas a very incorrect report, represen-ting me as saying many thingswhich I did not say. It was abad, jumbled mess. I name it 
 here in case you should read it, for Ido not claim it as my report at all.)I am in hopes someday ofseeing Sunset and other settlementsin Arizona again. Willyou please inform me in your nextletter what those tithing orders arethat Jesse N. Smith has given onyou, for we do not know anything about them here in theSalt Lake office. I want toadvise you and all the settlementsin Arizona to make an annualreport of all tithing to the generaltithing office here, as other stakesdo, for it will remove all chanceof prejudice against those whoare living in the United Order.But we do not know where thosetithing orders are from, nor whohas given them, that you speakof. 
 I named what you wrote concerninganswering any calls that President Taylormight make on you, but he prefers altogetherfor you to make up your regular tithingaccount annually, and let that be sub-ject to his order and no more. I wasglad to learn that Foutz and Walker and J. W. Y.were getting settled all right. Rememberme kindly to Brother Neilson, and say to himthat I got his ferry stock account all right,which will enable me to give credit to whom due.It is a general time of health with us, withfew exceptions. Elder O. Pratt's health isstill quite delicate. We expect: Geo. Q. Cannon with us on Tuesday. I amalways glad to hear from you. Rememberme kindly to all in the fort. Please deli-ver the inclosed to whom directed, and obligeyour brother in the Gospel.W. Woodruff 
 Salt Lake City, Nov. 10", 1882.Dear Brother Lot.Your letter dated Dec 1" (you meant Nov. 1") arrived all safe and I was very glad to get it.I had not time to say all I thou-ght about the matter when I wrote;I did not say that I believed the reports that were written to Prest. Taylor, for I consider that I am somewhat acquainted with you and I have been satisfied a good while that many things have been said about Br. Lot Smith that are not true.  I was somewhat surprised at what you said about the Pitkins for they sent a letter to Prest. Taylor - I do not know that it was signed by the young man 
 [sideways text] April 12 [18]81W. Woodruff [end of sideways text]Salt Lake City, [page torn] [April 12] 1880.Pres. Lot Smith,Dear Brother,I received your first letter after you returned home. I was truly glad to hear from you, and that Jim.had got well. I have been so overwhelmed since I got home, with Conference meetings, councils, company day & night that I have hardly had time to look a wife in the face. I have had no time to write and have not now, only a few moments. I was appointed at the Conference the Supt of the Young Men's M. I. Assns for the Terry. & Moses Thatcher and Jos. F. Smith; Counselors. I went to Ogden on Saturday to attend the Stake Conference of the Young Men.I forwarded the Tithing Receipts for the money I broughtfrom Arizona. I sent back the Order of L. Hatch as they could not change it. I sent them back to you.I hope you got them. Half of Farmington and part of Salt Lake County enquired about you. Your wife from Farmington called upon me and wanted to know how you get along. I told them well. The apostles seemed to appreciate washat assistance you are rendering to the needy who want bread. I wish also to say in this connection that the mother of Joseph H. Wil-kins of St John, she lives in Ogden. He is one of the car-penters we took dinner with at St John. His mother has heardthat he had nothing to eat but black beans. She wanted to know if she could not deposit 25 or 30 bus. of wheat in the Tithg Office 
 but by the father stating as I said that he brought in a new wagon, worth (I think) $140 and got one of no use except for old iron etc. and that you held an iron rod over his head and made him sign a receipt, fully by force, before you would let him go.  I did not thinka man would put such a tale as that in writing without something to make it out of.  I do not wish you to send any statement of all your operations to Prest. Taylor since you have been in the order, not on my account for I do not think he would have time to read them for I think he has now more than he wants to attend to; but it is well for you to keep all evidence in your hands to meet any accusations that may ever be brought against you. 
 I am much pleased with your nar-rative of the Echo Canyon war, in the Contributor.  It is very interestingThis is about all I want to say at this time.  Give my love to your wives and children and all the men.women, & children in Sunset.You brother in the Gospel,W. Woodruff  
 and let him [page torn] in Arizona. I talked with Bp. Hunterabout it, and he said he would do it. But I did not know where he could get the wheat in Arizona, except it was of you.So I told her to deopposit some wheat in the office and I would send the order to you and I hope you will do what you can about it. I think you took a bucket of flour to him, when we went there. We had a good conference, a large assembly, and the Spirit of the Lord with us. I want you to give my love and blessings to all the inhabitants of Sunset not leaving out the sisters and chil-dren. I have not time now to write upon any thing much only on business and hardly that. I found my family all well & glad to see me, as I was them. Please say to Bro Pitkin, I recd his letter & will write him when I can get time. Give my love to Bro LakeBrigham City, St Joseph and all my friends who enquire. I judged from what I learned from your letter that you was not going to have much trouble on the timber question, which I am thank-ful for, I shall always be glad to hear from you.Your Brother in the Gospel W Woodruff 
 Private. I wish to say that the subject came up of our permitting the young people to be married by the Authorities of the Church in Arizona, without going to the Temple. And the Council all sustained it where they were so far from the Temple. And the remark was made, that it would seem neces-sary to establish a place for Endowments at some future time in Arizona so that young people could get legally married, without going so far. I got a telegram from J. W. Y. at Albu-querque—was buying goods. I hope Bro Tenney will not mix any Mdse with the St John Purchase. And the Council wish all Co-op stores to be governed by the Presidency of the Stake. W

 W. Woodruff, Dec. 14, 1880St. John Mission, 200 familiesshould go there to settle.Bishop Udall authorized to recieve any tithing in Arizona:for payment of St. John.Salt Lake City, Dec. 14, 1880.Mr. Lot Smith, Sunset, Arizona.Dear Brother—Your letter of Nov. 24th arrived all safe, but I have not had time to answer it before.I was pleased to hear that you had a pros-perous journey to the west and back.I would have liked to have been with you at St. George, but could not be. I have thought perhaps that I might visit St. George some time during the winter, to attend to some Church business.It is a general time of health with us, with few exceptions.C. C. Rich is gaining some.O. Pratt's health is quite poor-ly .My health is quite good. Igot on the scales the other day. I weighed 166 lbs., about 4 lbs. more than I ever weighed before.My first wife a week ago had twenty five 
 teeth drawn at one time, under the in-fluence of ether, which made her sick for 24 hours, and she has had a sore mouth ever since.We had the coldest November I ever saw.It is more mild this month.Geo. Q. Cannon is in Washington.I have not heard from him since he left.I was sorry to hear of the bad luck of Brigham CitySaints with their crops.Are they all leaving?Where does Brother Lake go?How much wheat did you have, and how much corn?Bishop Udall of St.John has been with us to get help to pay for that place. He supposed, from Brother Tenney's representation, that the purchase was made for the Church,that is, that the Trustee was made responsible for the payment. This was a wrong idea entirely. It was bought for the Latterday Saints to go there, take possession of the land, 
 Salt Lake City, April, 15, 84.Lot Smith.Dear Brother:-Enclosed you will find a sheet containing the apportionment of the various Stakes in Utah to strengthen St. Johns.We held a meeting in the Social Hall last night and called 30 families from this stake; if 20 of them go I will be satisfied.  I sent out a copy last night to all the presidents of Stakes in the Ter-ritory hoping that they will act promptly.I received two letters from A.M. Tenney who says it is quiet at present but the enemies are hold-ing secret meetings and planning mischief.I am sending a copy of the apportionment to Bp. Udall to Jesse N. Smith to be forwarded by 
 and pay for it, but it has got in such a fix that the trustee had has had to stretch out his hand to assist to save the place.He gave an order onthe Southern herds for some 275 cows.Brother Udall conveyed an idea that you told him that you had 100 cows held in reserve to help to pay for that place.Brother Udall said he had not received them, and the question arises, Where are they? I did not know whether there was any mis-understanding about it. We want him to have any Church tithing of any kind in Arizona, that he can make use of, until that place is secured and paid for.Again, Brother Taylor has put it upon me to have all the emigration of the Saints that go to Arizona, to go to St. John, until there is enough there to take the land and water and use it.Brother Udall said 
 private conveyance, so that he may know what we are doing.Prest. Taylor, Cannon, and several others start for the Iron works on Wednesday and the Presidency go on to St. George for a short visit.My kind love to all, Your Brother in the gospel,W. Woodruff 
 that he met nearly 100 wagons going to Arizona, but he knew nothing about them, nor where they were going to, and thought many of them were going on their own hook, perhaps to get off by themselves.But as most of the emi-gration will go by Sunset, I want to dele-gate you to say to them that the counsel of the Presidency and Twelve Apostles to them is to go direct to St. John and settle there under the direction of Bishop Udall until he says it is enough.There should be nearly 200 families settlethere.There should be men enough to make use of all the water during emigration time, or we shall constantly have outsiders squatting down and claiming waste water.We wish you to say to all emigration of the Saintswho wish to claim fellowship with us,that we want them to take our counsel in this matter and go to St. John, 
 instead of going everywhere else, untilthat place is settled, and if they will not do this they cannot have our fel-lowship.When St. John is settled,after it is done satisfactorily, they can make changes if they wish.We look upon the St. John country as being as good as any part of Arizona, and unless the Saints possess and control St. John, there is no Mormon settlement will have any peace in that territory.It seems rather strange to us, the manner in which the last election was controlled.Brother Tenney's representation to me was that the Barth's asked for none of the offices whatever, only for our people to vote for the county seat to remain at St. John. But, instead of this, in the election the Mormons lost every office in the county.When I think that they hold the legal 
 majority of votes in the county, I think our people will find hard work to live under the control of that class of men who have held control of Apache County.It seems as though there was a screw loose somewhere in that election.But I feel that we should never rest until we have full control of St. John and root out that nest that dwellsthere.If there is any tithing stock,grain or money in any part of Arizona that Brother Udall can use for the payment of this debt, we wish him to have it.My love to your family and all the Saints in Sunset, not forgetting the children.Your brother in the Gospel,W. Woodruff

 SALT LAKE CITY, APRIL 18, 1884.Dear Brother,We presume that the statement of the number of families apportionedto be selected from your Stake to strengthen the settlement at St. John, Ari-zona, has been received by you and acted upon.We desire these brethren to proceed upon their journey as soon as theycan possibly make it convenient to do so.Some of those who are called may prefer to go by railroad, which ismuch more expeditious and expensive. We cannot say positively what the fare will be by rail, but perhaps not less than forty dollars for adults, chil-dren under ten years, half price. But all this business can be satisfactorily arranged in this city.We deem it more prudent, in the majority of cases, for the brethrento go across country with teams. True, by team it is a long and tediousjourney, but healthful and comparatively inexpensive. Then, when thebrethren arrive at their destination, they have their teams, wagons, harnessand many useful implements to begin to build up homes with and maketheir families comfortable.The proper route for teams will be up the Sevier river, over the dividevia Johnson to the Pahreah (formerly Lee's) Ferry, on the Big Coloradoriver, thence to Willow Springs, thence to Little Colorado river, up said rivervia Brigham City, Sunset, St. Joseph, Holbrook, Woodruff, Greer's Ranch, to St. John.Those who desire to go by railroad will travel by the Denver & RioGrande Railroad to Pueblo, thence by the Atchison, Topeka & Santa FeRailroad to Albuquerque, thence by the Atlantic & Pacific Railroad toNavajo Station, which lies about forty miles north of St. John. Completearrangements can be made for transportation by railroad, from this city toNavajo Station, thence by teams to St. John, by communicating with W. C.Spence, at President John Taylor's office, in this city.W. WoodruffChairman. 
 W. Woodruffhad any little difficulty, they wouldcome to me with their troubles. Ishould like to meet with all of themonce more.We have had a good conference;we set apart 107 missionaries theMonday following many of whomwere for the Southern States. Bro's. Ivensand Pratt are beginning to baptizea good many in Mexico. One ofErastus Snow's sons and Helaman Pratt are called to go there andassist in the work.We are looking for the Commission-ers to arrive at any time now, butthere is no excitement over them.We are having our March weatherin April -- it snows, rains & everyfew days.I understand that you havebeen East some where for bloodedbulls and stallions. What have yougot? How many sheet [sheep], horned stock &c 
 have you now? I What famalies haveyou with you? Do you still keepup a dairy at Pleasant Vally? Yourwill, of course is gone. How do youget your lumber?I am asking too many ques-tions but by visiting that country Ifeel interested in such questions.As everYour Brother in the Gospel,W. Woodruff

 Woodruff April21 [18]80Salt Lake City, April 21, 1880.President Lot Smith.Dear Brother—I have a goodmany things I want to say to youwith my pen, but up to the presenthour I have found but very littletime. We have been in either coun-cils, conferences, or meetings, of somekind, ever since I came home. Iwrote to you on the 12th and sent the ti-thing receipts and a letter to J. W. Y.Since then I have received a letter fromJ. W. Y., saying they were buying goods atAlbuquerque for Young, Christofferson,and others. He also spoke about takinga contract on the railroad for our people.President Taylor and myself telegraphedback that the Co-op. stores should be underthe direction of the presidency of the stakesand those who furnish the money. 
 Salt Lake City, Mar. 23rd, 83.Bro. & Sister Lot Smith:I have just received your letter containing the painful news of the loss of your little son Wilford. I feel to deeply sympathize with you in your loss and by such a death. My oldest son, Wilford is 43 years to-day. When a child he dranklye which came very nearly killing him. His throat grew up so that he came verynear choking to death for years afterwards and has not got entirely over it yet. I have sometimes thought the name itself was rather unfortunate; still I do not think that a name 
 I also got a letter, directed to BrotherTaylor and W. Woodruff, saying thatBrother Tenney had sent an agentto borrow a hundred cows, to BrotherFlake, to make a payment thisspring on the St. John purchase.Brother Hatch wanted the council tofurnish Brother Murdock or bearer$1,000 for Brother Flake, and forBrother Flake to furnish that amountof barley to Brother Hatch for the people tosow and make bread of. But the coun-cil did not wish to do it. The coun-cil has decided that the presidents ofstakes and bishops furnish Brother A.M. Tenney, as a loan, what tithingstock they may have on hand to helppay the 100 cows this spring, and wewant to continue to pay for thatpurchase until it is settled for, butwe want the people who go there topay the debt, and not the church. 
 has anything to do with good or bad fortune. Truly the loss of children in that way is painfulbut there is one consolation in the matter—you will have him again in the morning of the first resur-rection in your family organization, of the same age and size that you laid him away. I hopeyou may be comforted in your affliction. I would like to see you and your wives and children once more. Give my kind love to them all.I expect that little Lorenzo who used to help me about my break-fast is getting to be quite a boy. I should like to see all the children of the Sunset fortonce more.I understand that you went with Brothers Young and Grant 
 But we think it is necessary to helpabout it, so that we shall not losethe purchase. I thought there hadpeople enough gone there to raisethe 100 cows this spring. But wethink the church and the branchesin Arizona will be under the ne-cessity of helping about it, as aloan, until the place is secure.I have not had word from BrotherTenney since I left about St. John onthe mission.I found my family all well onmy arrival, and we were again gladto meet. We are having good times inour Conference meetings and councils.We are united in our councils and thespirit of the Lord is with us. Therewas a good deal of inquiry aboutyou at the conference by Farmingtonpeople and others. I hope to hearfrom you and know how all is 
 to the Seven Villages. I wish when you get time you would give me a little sketch of your visit among them—how muchtime you spent with them, holding meetings, with what success &c &c.How did as fat a man as Brigham get up and down amongthem? I should be glad to hear any information concerning their visit with you. What are the pros-pects among the Lamanites and what is A. M. Tenny ^doing^? What is the prosperity in your settlement?Any thing of that kind would be of interest to me. Give my kind love to the people of the fort.Write when you can.Your Brother in the Gospel,W Woodruff 
 getting on in Sunset. I miss mysociety there very much, especiallythose dear children. I want to sendmy love and blessing to all sunset, men,women, and children. I inclosea letter to J. W. Y., which you willplease forward to him, for I do notknow where to find him. I alsoforward in this the order for 30 bushelsof wheat for Brother J. W. Watkins atSt. John. The brethren thought thatas he was a missionary they wouldlet him have as much wheat thereas his mother put in here. I didnot know but you would be close runon the wheat question, but whateveryou can do in that line will be ablessing to him. It is still verycold here. On the 17th we hadnearly a foot of snow. The mountains 
 are full of snow, and if we were tohave warm weather we would standa chance to have a heavy flood.I want to send in your lettera few lines to Bishop Lake, of Brig-ham City, which please send to him.Your brother in the Gospel,W WoodruffBrother Lot Smith—I wouldrecommend that when you markyour lambs that you mark yourtithing lambs for the Church, andalso when you brand your calvesput the church brand on your tithingcalves, and that at the end of theyear you make a report of whattithing you have on hand, and 
 W. WoodruffSalt Lake City, Oct. 23, 1882.Elder Lot Smith.Dear Brother - I have felt a desire towrite to you for some time past. PresidentTaylor is receiving letters from persons who leaveyour fort and go to other places to settle.They complain bitterly of your treatmentof them in the settlement of their accounts.Among others, the Pitkins said that theirproperty was priced very low when takenin, and very high when taken out.They said they gave in a wagon worth$125, which was priced at $50, and gota wagon in return good for nothingbut old iron, and he was forced tosign a bill of receipt with an iron rodover his head, or something of thatkind. Now of course these stories are all on one side of the questionBut they have their effect against you,and I would like not to have anymore such stories come to the First Pres-idency, if possible to avoid it. 
 that this instruction be given to allthe branches in your stake.Brother Taylor says they get noreport of the tithing in Arizona,but I told him what had beenpaid on the ferry and the tithingmoney I brought. Please impartthis instruction to Brothers Lake,Richards, etc. 
 2Now I think that a man who has doneas much for Israel as you have in yourday, can afford to be generous with thosewho leave your settlement, and let them have as good as they bring toyou, inasmuch as they get no in-crease. There is hardly any manspeaks well of you, who leaves yoursettlement. They generally go awaydissatisfied. Brother Ira Hatchwas called by the authorities to go toSavoy, to assist Brother Titien. I haveNever heard of his saying anythingupon the subject. The quorumof the Twelve have been districtingUtah and the other territories on theIndian Mission question, but ithas been referred to the Presidency,and is now in their hands.We appointed you to stand at the headof the mission in Sunset Stake, andJesse N. Smith in Snowlake Stake, 
 3and if this thing is confirmed bythe Presidency, there may be someof the Twelve to visit all Arizona, NewMexico, etc., to assist in this organ-ization, as we shall want to gatherall the missionary strength we canin all those stakes. There is a great desire to make the Lamanitemission as effectual as possiblethroughout all the territories.President Taylor has received arevelation, in which George Teasdaleand Heber J. Grant were appointedto fill the vacancies in the Quorumof the Twelve Apostles, and SeymourB. Young and Abram H. Cannonwere appointed to fill the vacancies inthe quorum of the First Presidencyof the Seventies, all four of whomhave been ordained. We had agood Conference, strong preaching andstrong testimony. John T. Caine is 
 4the People's candidate for Congress, andVan Zile the ring candidate. Now,Brother Lot, I want you to write me a letter and tell me how manyfamilies you have got left with you.How your crops are this season. Howis the Indian question? What isthe prospect of labor among theNavajoes, Moquis, etc.? How isyour health, and how is your fami-ly? Give my love to them all.C.C. Rich was with us at Conference apart of one meeting. We anointedhim and blessed him.

 W. WoodruffSalt Lake City, Feb. 26th, 1884.Lot Smith.Dear Brother.I received your letter of Feb. 18th and I was glad to hear from you as I always am. I was sorry to have thatinteresting letter get drown-d and the money too, but it was better forthat to be lost than forthe man, at least if he was worth more than a hundred dollars and heought to be.I would be glad tovisit you again and tovisit your settlements, butI do not know when it will be. I would liketo visit your new settle- 
 ments at least the onein the mountains. I wouldlike to know what youare doing with Sunsetare you occupying theplace now; is it yourpost office? I see that youdate your letter there. TheMoquis are an innocentpeople but I think quitesuperstitious in some things. There seems to be quitean opening among the Maricopas and Pimas the leading men are receiv-ing the work and I thinkthe tribes will follow. Theyhad quite a difficultyof late with Crismonand his boys. I think his boys are hard cases. they take up Indian stock put them in the pen andcharge $1 a head and the Indians put someof Crismon's cattle in thepen and charge 50¢ each 
 and the Crismon boys undertook to take them byforce and threatened theirlives and there would havebeen a fight and the Cris-mon family wiped out if it had not been for Hinck-ley, Ray and Hawks, our missionaries who stoppedthe Crismon boys comingout on the ground to fight; that family hasmade a good deal oftrouble with Lamanites andMormons. Br. Young is visiting in California;I expect him home soon. Br. Thatcher has retur-ned from Washington andBr. Cannon is on hisway home which leavesBr. Caine alone. I donot know what Cong-ress will do but they aregetting wicked enough to do anything.It is a general time 
 Salt Lake City,Jan. 27, 1881.Lot Smith,Dear Brother; I recieved your letter of Dec. 28, 1880. I have not been able to answer it before.I am very sorry for your accident and hope you will recover from it, and that you may not be permen^an^tly lame. I do not hear a word from E. Snow or B. Young; in fact, do not know where they are or what they are doing, but suppose they are some-where in Arizona.We learned that Bishop Udell has crossed the Lees Ferry with all his stock, all well. I hope he will have good luck in getting them to St. John in safety.I see the editors of the "Dem-ocrat" seems to have a key to get knowledge. I know nothing of the 
 of health with us. I am somewhat troubled with acold at present which is a common complaintin this country at present. Br. Fowler who was labor-ing in the Tithing Office,died rather suddenly; webury him tomorrow. We are having pleasantweather overhead but ourstreets are very muddy.Our Legislators are grin-ding away the best theycan, but I do not know what they will accomplish.I spent the most of De-cember in St. George Tem-ple and had a good time and a good con-ference. I wish you wouldtell me by letter how manyyou have with you and 
 elections only from Brother Tenny.I am glad you are so fruitful.I hope your posterity will honor both God and their parents.I think the Navajoes were suc-cessful on their hunt.I hope Mary's boys will prosper as well as the rest.Remember me kindly to all your family and all in the Fort.We got a letter from George Q. Cannon.He feels well and is boyant in spirit.Says God reigns, and is thoroughly con-vinced that Gov. Murry has hurt him-self and his party much more than George Q and the Saints.The Apostles are all well ex-cept O. Pratt and C. C. Rich. The lat-ter is gaining very slowly, and O. Prattis quite poorly: mostly confined to his bed and room—is quite weak. But we hope for the best.

 Salt Lake City, Nov.28, 1882.President Lot Smith.Dear Brother - I received yourletter of Nov. 15, and in reading it Iwould judge that you had not receivedthe letter I wrote you Nov. 10. You didnot say that you had received it. Istated plainly in that letter in a privatenote that I did not believe the reports givenabout you. It is true, you cannot hin-der people talking, any more than I canand I do not care what people say againstone, if they do not tell the truth. I couldtell my enemies a great many failings Ihave that they do not know anything about,but I do not feel disposed to tell them. Theymay lie about me as much as they please,and I suppose they will do the same by you.I probably did not explain myself clearlywhen I said that I did not want anymoreof the stories to come to Brother Taylor.

 Salt Lake City, Dec 7th, 1882.Lot Smith.Dear Brother:Your letter of Nov. 28th, is before me, and I feel to say a little more upon the subject before us. I wrote to you on Nov. 28th which of course you had not received whenyou wrote last.I will here explain what I meant in speaking of Prest. Taylors' not having time to read such accounts as you spoke of. Of course he could ^read^ a letter, but if you sent a history of every man that has been with you in that order,what he brought in, and what he took out, it would be a document as large as the New Testament, and 
 unless you were on trial for these things it would not be necessary.I received a very interesting letter yesterday from Br. Christian Lingo Chris-tensen upon the Indian question. The administration to that lame Indian was very interesting. The time has come when we are commanded to turn unto them and it is beginning to be a day of God's power among them, and it is our duty now to go among them.I have felt to volunteer to go among them in Arizona and labor with them; but Br. Taylor rather claimed the right to distribute us. So he sends B. Young and H. J. Grant to Arizona & New Mexico.They will start about Jan. 6th, [18]83 and visit you and will look to you and Jesse N. to assist in their labors among them. E. Snow and M. Thatcher are now in Mexico, I suppose. F. M. Lyman goes 
 through the Uintah reservation, G. Teasdale to the Indian Territory, Cherokees, &c. L. Snow & F. D. Richards attend to the northern tribes. I shall give my views to Br.Brigham about his labor with you and the brethren in that territory.Concerning Br. Charles W. Stayner, he has been getting a code of revelations as big as the New Testament, and he, himself was to be the great coming man. Arthur Stayner at first said it was all from the devil; if he had stuck to it, it would have been well, but he finally fell in with and believed them. Chas. W. has been brought before a High Council and finally confessed they were not of God, asked forgivenessand has been forgiven; now, if he gives them up, all will be well with him.Prest. Taylor requires me to tarry in this country and not go into the 
 W. WoodruffIndian field. He thinks I am most too old and then I have the Historian's Office on my hands and a great dealof correspondence concerning the templesand other matters, and he wants me to attend the conferences in this country.Br. Taylor and myself with those of the Twelve who are here are now travelling two-thirds of the time. We have justbeen through Sanpete, Juab, and Utah counties. We start in the morning for the north.Manti Temple is ready to turn thearches over the upper story windows, andLogan Temple will be ready for dedi-cation by next Sept.— it might be by April if they had means enough. Weare in hopes that the Salt Lake Tem- 
 ple will be up to the square next fall.From what I learn I suppose a part of the county offices in the late election fell into the Mormons.I and my family are as well as usual; the Presidency and Twelve are also well. L. John Nuttall is around his house again. Elias Smith is stillvery bad, being confined to his bed, and in great pain most of the time. In his fall, he feel upon his lame side and paralyzed his right leg; and it looks as though it would be months before he can walk again if he can at all. Capt. Hooper came near dying of late. Br. Van Cott is very low with brights disease. Br. Peck is able to be 
 out again.Prest. Arthur thinks there has been en-ough legislation at present for the Mor-mons. But Gov. Murry thinks differently, and Murry may attempt to appoint another Prest.—Van Zile for instance.Remember me to all with you, es-pecially your wives and children.Your Brother in the Gospel,W.

 Salt Lake City, Utah.Nov. 8th, 1883.Lot Smith.Dear Brother.Your very kind letter of Nov. 1st arrived all safeand I read a portion of it in Council yesterday (I left out that portion concerning my interest in humanity as my company might have differed from you in that sentiment—I would not read it to them). All were much pleased with your account of the Indians. Br. Teas-dale has returned from the Cherokee Nation; he has labored hard for six months and not 
 baptized a soul. Brs. Daulton and felt are still there but find it an up-hill business. I would rather go among the wild Indi-ans to convert them to the gospelthan among those who are so much Christianized and priest rid-den.I was glad you agreed with me about your family here.  I understand they were calculating to go back, I have not seen them since.I suppose that Brs. Young and Grant are some where in your country—you will probobly see them.We buried Brs. Lewis Robison and Israel Barlow; we have buried a good many aged people during the present year.We attended Logan Conference 
 on Saturday and Sunday. Wewent all through the Temple and expect to see it ready for dedi-cation by March. The roof of the Manti Temple will soon be finished. Salt Lake Temple is up to the square—there will be a few more rocks laid before it is put aside for the winter.Brs.

Academy, Provo.Dear Brother:Your favor of Dec. 5th has been received. We regret thatany circumstances have arisen to cause you to so write. We believe weappreciate the good that the B. Y. Academy is doing, and would not donor say anything, nor have others do or say anything, that would lessenits influence for good among the youth of Israel. We are, however, ledto think that possibly you received an exaggerated account of what Bro.Grant said at the Y.M.M.I.A. Conference, as we understand you were not present, and had to depend on what others, who were, possibly, undulyexcited, told you. Bro. Joseph F. Smith was present, and did not recog-nize in the remarks made those difficulties that present themselves toyour mind and those of your associate teachers, and he thought that when,later in the day, Bro. Grant made an explanation, if not an apology, thathe covered the objectionable features of his earlier remarks. We believethat you will act wisely in letting the matter drop, as we do not thinkthe incident was of sufficient importance for you to entertain theindignant feelings that your letter suggests.With kindest regards,Your Brethren,Wilford WoodruffJos.

 An account of the mission to the Cherokee, Creek and Choctam Indians in the years 1855 to 1860.At the April Conference held in G.S.L. Cityin the year 1855, Elders Henry W. Miller,Robert C. Petty, Wash ton N. Cook, Wm. Richeyand John A. Richards were appointeda mission to the Indians west of Missouriand Arkansas States. They left Salt Lakevalley in May 1855 and reached Mormongrove in June; after reaching Kaw riverthe President, Bro. Miller appointed BrosCook and Richards to labor among the DelawareIndians, the remainder of the brethren wentto the Cherokee Nation, where they reached inthe fore-part of July. They stopped amonga small number of brethren on Spavenaw river in the Cherokee N., who had come fromTexas, but meeting some of  J. J. Strong'sdisciples in the Cherokee Nation, they concludedthat matters were rather wrong in Salt Lakeand located in the C. [] Some of those beth-ren had been with Lyman Wight and becoming 
 dissatisfied with his course, had left him. Bro. Millerwith his associates soon convinced those brethrenconcerning the leadership of the Church andthe majority of them numbering betw. 40 and 50emigrated to the valley in 1856. In 1858 and 1859 the remaining few of the Lyman Wight followerslocated at the same place; among the number arethe Colonel's first wife, who had of late receiveda letter from Sidney Rigdon, in which he denouncesthe authorities of the Church in the valley and prophesies evil concerning this people. ElderHenry Eyring has preached in 1859 to those people, they however uphold their own views and likelywill until the Lord chooses to interfere in their be-half.Bros Cook and Richards who had been un-successful among the Delaware joined theirbrethren in the Cherokee Nation in the forepartof fall 1855 and commenced their labors inthe Cherokee nation. Mormonism being quitea new thing in that country the people cameby great numbers ^to hear^ and as a general thinga good many believed and a few werebaptized. Prest Orson Spencer and Elder JamesMc Gaw came from St Louis to counsell with the brethren concerning the work in that country 
 and had an interview with the chief of the CherokeesJohn Ross, who granted them the privilege to preach. Prest Miller deemed it wisdom to callon the St Louis church for some Elders to assistamong the Cherokees and other nations if required. Subsequently upon the return of Prest Spencer ata Conference, held in St Louis Octob 6 1855 EldersJames Case, Wm Bricker, Geo Higginson Wm O.Flavell and Henry Eyring were sent to assistthe Elder on the Ch. Mission. They arrived all but Wm O. Flavell who concluded to return toKeokuk after going with the rest as far asSpringfield Mo on the 10th Novemb 1855 at thesettlement on Spavinaw, Ch. N. At a meetingheld in the same place Pres Case, Richards, Brickerand Eyring were appointed to labor among the Creek, and Bros Cook and Higginson among theChoctaw Indians. Bro Miller and Richeyto remain in the Cherokee Nation principally. Bro R C Petty was in very poor health andfinally died Feb 1st 1856. Bros Richards and Bricker andon their wayto the Creek Nation stopped at the house of Some Cherokees (Wm Burgess and family)Mrs Mary Burgess an old lady was at the point of death and was given up by the doctor 
 4and her children to die. The brethren administ-ered to her and the Lord raised her up and she and most of her family subsequent-ly were baptized. December 31st 1855 BrosCase and Eyring arrived in the Creek Nationand commenced to lay the foundation for the workin that country. Bro Case and Richards went to see the chief of the Creeks, Gen [] Rollie McIntoshwho thought that there were already preachers enoughin the country and there was no need of any more.He however did not forbid us to preach. Thewinter in the forepart of 1856 was very severe andthe Elders on that mission being obliged to laborfor their board, suffered to a good extent.At the opening of spring they receieved their labors and were syccessful in baptizing some. Bro Eyring baptized an Indian Town chief, who through his influence inclineda number to be baptized The same springBro Case organizied a branch called PrincesCreek branch Creek N.; at present they are not fully organized in that locality; the firstPrest resigned, the 2nd died and the thirdapostatised and the fourth resigned; they nowhave a teacher and meet ocasionally for worship. In April 56 Bro Eyring having received an invitation, made a trip into the Cherokee Nation and baptized 6 in the course ofthe summer and ordained one Elder, one of those bapitzed was aged 145, helived 2 years after his baptism anddied in the faith. Several were also added 
 by the other Elders and a branch organized onPriors Creek Cher. N. in the summer of 1856. Thoseconnected with that branch have removed toanother locailty and the branch was dissolved. Sickness now made considerable []upon the Elders, they were all take with the []and fever and at a Conference held on PriorsCreek Octob 6th 1856 there was not one of themin the enjoyment of health. Bro Miller beingreleased, appointed Bro Cook Prest of the missionand released Bro Case who was then quite low. Bro Bricker had previously recievedleave to visit his wife in St Loudis and had leftbefore Conference, but never returned andsince has denied the faith. Pres Miller and Case left in November 1856 and returned to thevalley in 1857. - Bros Cook and Higginsonreturned in Oct 56 from the Cherokee nation, without being able to baptize any. ThatNation has since been left without Elderswith the exception of 2 trips which BroEyring made there in the summer of 1859without having any success apparently. In October 1856 an order was issued by theChief of the Cherokees for all Mormon 
 Elders to leave the nation forthwith. Thus all united to labor among the Creeks with theexception of Bro Richey who remained amongthe Cherokees unmolested by avoiding public speaking. Bro Richey has been a faithful ministerto the Cherokees and although unsuccessfulin baptizing any, he has borne a faithful testimonyand considering his age and bodily infirmitieshe certainly has done more than many woulddo under the same circumstances. Having also beenrestricted in the Creek Nation but little wasdone for the remainder of the year 1856 by theElders. April 6th 1837 a conference was heldin the Creek Nation Bro Cook presiding; ElderP.P. Pratt present; we had a time of rejoicingand Bro Pratt experienced himself satisfied with the labors of the Elders. Bro Higginsonhaving been requested by Bro Pratt before hisdeath to see his family in the valley, left inthe summer of 57. The same summer an order was issued by the Creek council for all Mormon Elders to leave the Nation. Bros Cook and Richards left for the Cherokee Nation where they recommenced their laborswithout being disturbed. Bro Eyring waspermitted to stay in the ^the^ Creek Nation on the 
 condition that he be employed to work for a native. The general excitement against the church in 1857 made it impossible to domuch good and but little was effected everafterwards. Pres Cook who won the love andrespect of saint and sinner, after a short but severe illness died September 24th 1858 of quick consumption. At a conference heldin the Cherokee Nation Bro Henry Eyring wasnorminated and sustained as Bro Cook's successor. A general work of reformation was then commenced,and the saints required to be rebaptizedIn the year 1859 Prest Eyring travelled in the Cherokee Creek and Choface nations, and added a numberto the church and organized one branch(Lehi branch in Cher. N) and one (Nephi branch) inthe Creek Nation. The former branch was dis-organized, the Prest and teacher emigrating to the valley. There is one Elder in that locality who has change of the few remaining saints there. The branch in the Creek nation is still organized, the Prest having charge ofall the saints in the Creek Nation. The number of saints in the Cherokee andCreek nations was Octob 6 1859 43 in the former 
 and 48 in the latter nation but out of that number but very few are alive in the cause, the majorityare careless and indifferent. The prospect to do further good at present being quite slimElders Wm Richey and Henry Eyring leftMay 23rd 1860 for the valley and reachedSalt Lake City Aug. 29th. Bro Richardsstill remains on his own accord in the Cherokee Nation, not situated however to do much good.In taking retroactive view over the laborsof the Elders among those Indians for 5years, it is quite evident that the resultof those toils, privations and hardshipsand the sickness of all and the deathof 2 Elders connected with it, is but verysmall apparently. But it is to be hopedthat in after years spontaneous fruits may spring up frrom the exortions of theservants of God among the seed of Jacob.-The Cherokees are to a great extent mixedwith the Gentiles and to some degree with the negroes. A majority of themspeak the english language and arein their manners, customs, habits and traditions similar to if not equal unto the whites. Quite a number have goodbrick and frame houses and have 
 good farms well stocked with negroes, cattle horses and hogs etc. They are as a people hospitable to strangers they will feed and lodge an Elder, but they don't realize that he has to have clothing towear and that they out to contributeto that portion of his wants; The Elderstherefore were oblihed to labor with theirhands from time to time to obtain thosenecessaries. They are politically organized similar to the whites, having a 1th and 2nd chief upper and lowerhouse of represaentatives, judges, courts and plenty of lawyers, which by thebye is no essential benefit to anycountry . Wickedness is on the in-crease among them; murders are com-mitted almost every week. Muchexcitement also prevails on a/c of the slavery question.Their country is excellent for farming, timber as grass are abundant. The full blooded Cherokees are generally indolent and farm on a very smallscale, many however raise cotton 
 and sheep and spin, dye and weave theirown clothing. They have some steam andwater power mills in operation. -The Creeks are less united with the Gentiles but more with the negroes than the Cherokees. They are as respects good houses, farmsand general improvements behind theCherokees, murder is but seldom committed(although on the increase) and generally speaking the Creeks are more peaceable, but lessenterprizing than the Cherokees. Their politicalorganization is similar to that of the Cherokeesbut remains a good deal of yet of old customsand traditions. Some have extensive herdsof cattle numbering a thousand head and upwards, also ponies by large quantities.Sectarianism has been disseminatedamong both nations to a great extentand although much has been saidagainst the Elders by them yet they haveused no violence to them all most understanding some having made threats to that effect.The Cherokees at present number about16000 the Creeks near about the same. 
 Much might be added to this account but I hardly deem it wisdom to be too lengthly, hoping that what I have written may be accepted.I subscribe myself with high esteemyour Bro in the gospelHenry EyringTo Elder Wilford WoodruffHistorian's Office

 Having got to the city of Helsingborgthe 6th day of Juli I did not feel werrywal I laid down about 2. O'klok in the afternon and I fell asleap and sleapt betven one and two hours the dreamis this, I dreamt that I saw a great big Bilding the largest that I ewer saw the wals was up and theRoof was on but a great deal of work was yat to be done there where somanny arches of wood and of bricks andso manny brases and stais wherewer I lockt that I tought I newer saw anny-thing like it before & I also had to work in this Bilding this made me feel verry Temed to think of working in such a large Bilding and I Tought everybody wold be locking at me but as I lockedaround to se the workmen that the had ther I thought that I was just as good a mason as the had there so I tock kurig and went after my tols as I tought that I had laid them in a Corner of the bilding 
 but it semed that my tools wher a littel diferent to wat the had thereand al the Peopel in the Bilding tur-ned around to lock at me but for al it semed that I was sent there to work and cold not get out of it but I had it to do and I cold se the nesesety for ther was a great deal of work to do and werry few to do it, and I wokeThis dream gave me enkurigment and I wondered but felt much betterthan I had preveasly done acording to my interpetation of this dream I tought it suted my circomstanses the Bilding being the Churh the arches brayses and stays the Holy skriptures to seport the Bilding and also seport me in my administration or work in the bilding I being a mason by trade my tools be- ing the langwig  wich was not werry esey to get along wiht for I was astrainger in my own landI find in traveling among the Peopel 
 that the do not care about our religion as the can find a much esier way of going to Heven than we teach them and that is the say the Lord have done al for them He has died for ther^since^ and al the can do is to sin this faihtto my astonihment have almost taken the lead of the Peopel in that Land but stil we are doing a littel a few is be-ing added to the Churh by BaptisimI wil her make mention of a remarkebel insedent as hapened at Trelleborg a seatow^n^on the sothern costs of Sveden a yong women having aplied for Baptisim and no other plase but the sea the windhad been bloing hard al day and the waves was roling heavy the yongman as was to administer the ordinance I told him to be verry carful so that the waves do not take you bought under but to our astonishment the waves went down and the water stod per-fektly stil and the sea was smoved 
 for about a rod al around them and as the come up the sea come gust a roling after them and wold dashup upon the land from tvo to fifeefiveyards ther was present seven personstvo of whom was not in the Church and as the al remarked ^to me^ the had never seen anything like it before this aswal as manny other mannefestations of the power of God made manefetst before my eyes have strengtened my faith in thework that I am engaged in I have also seen the Power of God made mannefest in several instanses in heling of the sick under my hands not onely in Sveden but right here at home as my yongest Child have almost been raised from the dead gust before I started on my mistion he them being about tvo yars old and is stil livingI have traveled on fot nearly tre tousand miles and atended one hundred and seven-teen metings Blesed one Child Baptised

 612 Van Ness AvenueSan Francisco, Cal. Sept. 29th, 1896Pres. Wilford WoodruffSalt Lake City, UtahDear Brother:I returned from Sacramento and Latrobe last Thursday. We heldsome very successful meetings and were well represented by the press.We have just added six more to the church. There is a gradual increasein all of our congregations, yet we have plenty of indifference tocontend with. I received the tracts and Voice of Warning you sentby the Elders.I have been waiting anxiously for definite word about me staying in the mission. My wife is not enjoying very good health and beingwhooly dependent upon others, it is almost more than she can do tocare for herself and three litttle ones. If you decide for me toremain here and it be consistent with your feelings I would like to have my family with me. But that would increase the expense andadd unto your burden and it makes me feel that perhaps it would bebetter for you to send some one who is able to bear the expense. Thereare Elders who would carry the mission successfully if they could comeand stay with me a little while until they become familiar with ourmethods and I believe it would be well to consider it before you de-cide to keep me. However the matter rests wholly with you. I amwilling to do as you say and do my best to further the cause whetherhere or elsewhere.Perfect harmony exists among the Elders and we are enjoying ourlabors, but we have some unpleasant things occasionally among themembers. The other power has been working to divide our flocks butso far all little troubles have proven a benefit to us. I have justreleased Elder B. W. Henderson on account of the financial depression.He is a member of the Henderson and Sons firm at Oneida, Idaho, andis an excellant young man with good judgment. He has been in the Mission 19 months.When I sent in my report on the 2nd inst. the mission indebted-ness was $114.18. I borrowed the money of Bro. Scowcroft to carry mealong but another month is almost gone and rents are due. I hope youwill be able to make an appropriation of $150.00 for the benefit ofthe mission.We will hold our northern conference here next Sunday, October 18thwe will hold our Southern Conference in Los Angeles. I hope to leavefor there about the 12th. Brother and Sister Scowcroft will accompany mesouth. I expect to be south two and one-half months. I will leave 
 estimate approximately at 25.00, if I get away in two weeks which I think sufficient time to stay. My ticket to Frisco will be $10.00 and I wouldbe glad to return by Portland which would add $10.. to the home trip, making it $29.00 to Salt Lake, whcih will make immergent expenses amountto $150.00. If you will send me that amount I can settle the Missionexpense and get home at the end of the expected time. I have borrowed whatmoney I have needed here for the Mission expense which is included in theabove amount.Please write me at your earliest convenience at 612 Van Hess Ave.,San Fransisco, and let me know if it meets your approval for me to returnvia Portland, and if I can do anything for you while here.I have put the Richards matter in the hands of Elder Millard Scoveroft who is a thoroughly competent business man and he will report to you the outlook of the Richards claim and his proposals.I hope to receive a receipt of the above tithing account and also a check to balance the mission expenses as soon as convenient.We held our conference here in Los Angeles the 18th ulcimo, wherevery encouraging reports were made. Our meetings in the south have notbeen largely attended though we look for better opportunities now thepolitical confusion has ended for a season.The elders are well organized in the two conferences under the imediatedirection of Presiding Elders of experience so that Elder Nye, if he feelsthat our plans are good ones, can easily direct the mission and continuethe plans already adopted with out trouble.The Elders will all give Bro Nye their support and I feel that greatgood will be accomplished. Hoping to hear from you soon, and that arelong I will have the pleasure of seeing you. I am very thankful for thesupport I have received and above all that I can feel in my heart that Ihave filled my mission in honor. My prayers will continue with the workthough I may have to deal with sterner realities.May God ever bless and prosper you and the people under your ^watch^ careis the prayer of your humble servant.Your brother(Sgt)  Henry S.

Wilford WoodrufSalt Lake City, Utah.Dear Bro:Having returned from a mission to the Southern States without the privilege of meeting with or visiting any of the Apostles I thought I would write you a few lines that you might know of the safe arivelof My myself and Elder J. S.Cram of Kanab.  It was my desire to report to you in personbut because of the illness of Elder Cram I was instructed by PrestElias S. Kimball & Prest. S. P.Oldham of the S.C. Conferenceto see to his safe arival at  Bel-nap station on the Riogrand Western 
 Ky. six miles above here, where his folks would meet and take care of him. Before we reached here we learned, that his folks were waiting for him at Belwah, and as he had improved ^in health^ some on the journey he thought it unnecessairy for me to go on with him to that place.  I was set apart for a miss-ion to the Southern States Feb 22nd 1895 and started out on the following day. On ariving at ChattanoogaTenn. I was appointed to lavorin the S. C. Conference. In company with Elders Bond Stephenson & Fortie I want to Columbia where we met Prest Beatie I first labored with Elder G. S. Bralley in Chester Co. then with Elder J. F.Hyatt in York Co. After conference which was held in Williamsburg Co. in the month of October I was sent with Prest. S. P. Oldham to open up Barn

C.THE TEMPLE, SALT LAKE CITY. S. C., 189well Co. I remained there until Aug 1896.My next field of labor was York Cowhich place I continued untill my release which was June 23. 1897.Because of false reports the people of York Co are generally very much oppos-ed to Mormons and Mormonism untill it was often that we could not get to talk or hold meetings with the people as we would have liked. But with all I think a greate deal of prejudice has and will continue to be alayed. Twenty or more persons have been united to the church since Elder Hyatt and I went to that Co. and I think there are several others amongst the first friends that the Lord raised up to us that will come into the Church before very very much longer. 
 We have near Blacksburg (which place was in York Co but is now cut off and forms a part of Cherokee Co) a Sunday School with about forty members.My health was very good the most of the time.  While traveling I was greately bless-ed and protected of the Lord and have received many testimonies that the work is of the Lord. These blessings and testimonies will be given to every elder that will do the best he can however weake he may be.I believe the S.C. Conference is in a thriving condition and will no doubt continue to prosper for I believe the elders do desire and are trying to carry out council. Wall Dear President I feel that I have not lost anything by going on this mission and if there is any other labor the Lord desires me to preform with His blessings Ihope to be able to preform it.May the Lord help us to preform every duty and labor and keep us in the faith is the preayer ofYour Bro.J.

 July 30 [189]7President W. WoodruffBox BSalt Lake CityUtahDear Brother,For some time past we have been trying to discover some good method to adapt in this stake to bring our people closer together. We have felt that politics have scattered them in such a manner as to bring much injury to many of those who should be more closely commited with all our church organizations and in watching our local newspapers we see them filled from week to week with nothing but politicalquarrels. Our people are great readers of the local papers and we are of the opinion that if a local paper were started here under the direction of the Presidency 
 of this stake with some of our leading bishops, have it free from politics and devoted to the upbuilding of our stake and the organizationsof the church, it would do more towards bringing our people together and creating a better feeling among the people of the various wards than any other one thing we could do just at present. But before doing anything in the matter we have felt that it would be our duty to write you regarding the same and ask if it would meet with your approval. If you have no objections we would like to try the adventure.An early answer would greatly obligeWe are Your Brethren in the GospelT E RicksWm F RigbyThos. E. Bassett

 [OF]FICE OFThe First Presidencyof theChurch of Jesus ChristofLatter-day SaintsP.O. Box, B.Salt Lake City, Utah. Oct. 14, 1893.Prest. W. T. Stewart,New Zealand.Dear Brother:Your favor of Aug. 12th reached our office while we wereabsent at the World's Columbian Exposition at Chicago, or it would havebeen answered by the last mail.With regard to the matter—the emigration of some of theMaori Saints—that occupies the most prominent place in your communicationwe will say that, as you are aware, we have hitherto felt reluctant toencourage the wemigration of any of this people from their native islandsto Zion; our experience with our Kanaka brethren and sisters not havingbeen altogether encouraging; but after perusing your letter and learn-ing therefrom their characteristics, their industry and capability forsuch work as is incidental to the opening of a new country we have feltthat a limited number of the best and most capable brethren and theirfamilies might at the present be permitted to gather, such ones as youand your associate missionaries would deem most suitable to meet andovercome the difficulties and peculiarities of so great a change in theirmode of life as would be incidental to their removal to the^se^ mountains.Neither do we think it would be well to treat them as our emigrants ofthe white races are treated—permit them when they reach here to make away for themselves, locate where they choose and provide for theirnecessities as seems best to their judgment. We believe that it will bedesirable to have our Maori friends placed in the charge of some one ormore of the brethren who know their language and who have love and 
 sympathy for them as a people; and further that they be advised to settlein some district or region of our country where the climate is as suitableto them as can be found, and the natural productions consistent with themodes of life that will be most advantageous to them. In considering thismatter, we have come to the conclusion that Kanab and its neighborhoodwill be as suitable for settlement by the limited number that you suggest,as any other portion of the inter-mountain region with which we areacquainted.Such of the intending emigrants as can do so, of thosewhom you decide are proper persons to come, should accompany you onyour return hiome, so that they can have the benefit of your counsel andguidance on the way. Further, we should be pleased to have you continueyour supervision over them when they reach their future home, that theystill may have a father to look to for the instruction, guidance andsupport that they will undoubtedly need. But of the details of this,and who shall be called to assist you, when such are needed, we can morefully arrange when we meet you.It is probable that all the missionaries for whom youhave asked for New Zealand, Australia and Tasmania will not leave by theNovember boat. The stringency of the times is such that a number of thebrethren who have been called on foreign missions have not been able toraise their passage money by the time appointed and their departure hashad to be postponed. So, we have reason to believe, will be the casewith some of those called to labor under your presidency.We will now say, Brother Stewart, that you are honorablyreleased, with our approval and blessing on your labors, from thePresidency of the Australasian Mission, with the privilege of returninghome whenever you consider the best interests of the mission will per-mit. You will please transfer to Elder William Gardner, who has beenchosen to succeed you, all the books, papers and property of the mission, 
 and aid him in assuming his new duties by affording him all the informa-tion with regard to the churches and their members that lies in your power.It has been the custom to require half yearly StatisticalReports from the various Stakes of Zion and from the Foreign Missions,but at our last General Conference, it was decided that in future anAnnual Report made up to December 31st of each year would better answerthe purpose. In the past the reports have, in many cases, been incompletecovering various periods of time, and ending at almost every day of thecalander year. This irregularity has robbed these reports of allreliability regarding the facts which they are intended to represent andmade them misleading rather than trustworthy. It is hoped that thischange will not only secure uniformity but completeness also, if aneffort is made by the Secretaries and others, whose dutiy it is to attendto these things, to have them as perfect as possible. You will thereforemake your next Statistical report include the period from the date ofyour last report to the end of this year, and annually thereafter.The brethren chosen for Tasmania are Elders F. W. Ellis(North Ogden) and Lysander C. Pond (Pocatello). Elder Ellis is a man offine ability, lengthy experience and a good singer. He is about 40years of age. Elder Pond is a younger man, also well recommended. Hehas written for permission to have his wife accompany him, stating thatshe was a young woman admirably adapted for missionary work. We wroteback that Tasmania would be a hard missionary field for a sister, but ifhe still desired it, we would not object. At this writing, we have notlearned which way he has decided. Two of the other brethren will beinstructed to secure tickets for Sidney, and on their arrival you canchange the field of labor of any or all of them as you, from yourknowledge of the needs of the mission, may deem best. 
 With love to yourself, your fellow missionaries, and allthe Saints,We remain, Your Brethren,Wilford WoodruffGeo. Q. CannonJos. F. Smith

 Mar 8th [189]8Pres Wilford WoodruffSalt Lake City UtahDear BrotherWe quote the following extract from a letter from Bp. Wm. B. Preston to us under date of Mar 1st"We beg to inform you that in the future we can not allow the Tithing Department to be charged with the expense of buggy for Pres. Ricks, as also the feed and care of horses for him.  These items must be eliminated from the amount of 1898 unless permission is given in writing by the First Presidency"A word of explanation as to what we have beendoing in this particular might not be out of placeWe have on hand a large two [axled] buggy that was furnished for our use a few years ago under the direction of Bp Preston.  We also have a buggy harness here belonging to the Tithing DepartmentBro Ricks has furnished his own team gratuitously,but the expenses of feed, repairs, horshoeing etc have been charged to the general expense account of our 
 Stake office. We estimate that between Fifty and Fifty Five Dollars on Hay and Grass has been fedthe team and about Twentyfive or Thirty Dollars in repairs sharing etc per annum has been expendedin keeping the outfit in a reasonable condition for service.  Our reasons for so doing are that our stake is so large that we felt that we could not do justice to our duties in our official capacity unless some convenience of this nature was provided.While we have your attention we beg to state thatunder existing instructions we feel somewhat delicate in drawing anything on our customary appropriationuntil receiving your order to do so. Should it meet your approval an order for the amount usually allowed Pres Ricks and Rigby would be appreciated Brother Bassett feels in a condition to get along without any for the present at least.I shall be pleased to know your minds on both matters mentioned above whenever convenient for you to favor us with their consideration. With Kindest regards we remain Yours Very truly  T E RicksWm F Rigby T. E. Bassett 
 Jany 28 [189]8Pres W. WoodruffSalt L. City UtahDear Brother:We enclose herewith communication from Elder Don. C. Driggsexplaining itself.  If the arrangements are as he states we have a misunderstanding of the caseOur impressions were that no one of our missionaries to Montana were to be called for only three months with the exception of those who had previously had an experience in the missionary field.When Bro Jone Henry Smith was here at our late Stake Conference Bro Drigg's name was suggested for a mission to Montana but on account of his business interests he was allowed a certain length of time to make the necessary preparations.We are not posted as to whether any other arrangements have been made by Bro John Henry or yourself, and would be pleased to know 
 as to whether such is or is not the case so as to be able to explain your wishes to Bro Driggsand give him the necessary information as to his Railroad permit, License, setting apart etcupon his arrival here on Monday next also as to whether his call is for three months only.With best wishes we remainYour Brother T E RicksT.

 Mar 15th [189]8Pres Wilford Woodruff and CounselorsSalt L. City UtahDear Brethren:I am in receipt of a communication from Elder Geo Reynolds under date of Mar 14th stating that you would be pleased to learn from me what were my legal and other reasons that caused me to look with disfavor on the effort to remove the County Seat from StAnthony to Rexburg.My legal reason is in Sec 2 Art 18 of our State Constitution which reads as follows.Sec 2 3 county seat shall be removed unless upon petition of a majority of the qualified elctors of the county and unless two thirds of the qualified electors of the county vote [for] the proposition at a general election shall vote in favor of such removal. A[word faded] petition of removal of the county seatshall not be submitted in the same county more than once in one year, except as provided 
 by existing laws.The election that made St Anthony the Permanent County seat was held in the fall of 1894. With some, I admit it is held that the six year provision does not apply to the first removal of a permanent county seat and that it only refers to a proposition of removalafter a similar attempt has been previously made Others hold that it would apply with equal propriety in a first attempt of removal. As to just how the courts would interpret this is a question that the future only could decide and to combat the opposition that would undoubtedly be made on this technicality in case of our obtaining the necessary votes would unquestionably entail considerable expenses and of course with our favorable chances of losing even then.A careful canvass of the votes by precinct at our last election indicated very strongly to me that it was an absolute impossibility to acquire the necessary votes for its removal atthe coming election and that an almost super human 
 effort would have t[o] be made to come anywhere near that number involving an outlay of thousands of dollars, much valuable time and a serious division in the good feelings and unity of our people that would inevitably result from a contest of this nature.With the growing sentiments in favor of Rexburg by reason of our religious and educational interest and the standing morality of our people and the waning sentiment in favor of St Anthony caused by the encouragements to crimes of various ^kinds^given there and other causes, I felt that our vote in the future say 2 or 4 years hence would be stronger and that should ^we^ be successful in then obtaining the necessary 2/3 vote all legal questions that now embarras us would be removedwithout the expense and annoyance of having to fight them in the courts.While at Salt Lake City a few weeks ago [text faded] see you personally on this matter I left [text faded] us not only of 6 of the committee of [text faded] but had been selected to investigate and 
 determine whether or not a contest should be made but by others of our leading business and influential men in the hands of Brother Geo. F. Gibbs, all of whom sustained me in the cource I took and to which I beg to refer you for further information on this subjectIf however these are not sufficiently explanatory I shall be pleased to answer any questions you may desire to ask at any time.I beg to assure you that my advice on this matter was only taken after a careful consideration of all sides of the question having in view the best good of our people as a whole and with no desire to harm even the ^an^ hair of the headof any man.Hoping that at your convenience you will favor me with your opinion as to whether my cource in the premecis did or did meet with your approval I remainYours very truly.  T E RicksWe endorce the above sentiments andCoincide with Pres Rick's actions in the foregoing. Wm F Rigby Thos E. Bassett.
