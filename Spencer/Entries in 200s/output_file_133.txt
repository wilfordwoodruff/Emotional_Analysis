 There were present on the stand Prest W. Woodruff  who addressed the conference on the kind providence   of God in giving the Saints such abundant crops. 
 Prest. W. Woodruff said, if we could have the privi-  lege of looking behind the veil, we would not  need any sermons on Temple building; we would  be so eager to rear them understanding the great  necessity of this work, just think there are 50  generations waiting for us to do the work for them. 
 Prest. W. Woodruff compared this church to David who fought Goliath and like him we would come off victorious - 
 Prest W. Woodruff was pleased to see the saints  enjoy so many blessings. There is but one way of building  up the Kingdom of God and that is by paying strict  attention to the performance of our duties. 
 Prest. W. Woodruff said that the Lord had commenced  this work and he will see that it be victorious. 
 Prest. W W. Woodruff addressed the conference  on our duty to be faithful in our covenants  and to be diligent in Temple building. The  Saints should not bear any feelings against  one another. God will overrule all for our  good. 
 Prest W Woodruff said he had been  in the Church 50 years – related several incidents  of the conduct of the prophet Joseph – Bore  his testimony that he was a true prophet. 
 Apostle Wilford Woodruff said he was pleased  to meet the Saints in conference. The Lord has set  his hand to gather Israel in fullfilment of   prophecy, had been with the Church for fifty  years, a little one has become an hundred and fifty  thousand: The Lord has decreed he will raise up  a righteous nation out of this people, yet we have  a work to do, as the war between God and Satan will  continue untill Christ comes. 
 Pres. Woodruff was much pleased to meet with the young people  He said they have a work before them that no other generation has ever had. Spoke of the responsibility that would in the near future rest upon the yong people, that they would have to bear of this Kingdom.  Singing and Benediction 
 Jany 14, [189]5    President Wilford Woodruff  Salt Lake City    Dear Brethen,    Referring to Shelley  Branch of Fayden ward which is  located on stake Railroad about 8  miles south of Eagle Rock. The people  there remember 1 12 61 saints in about 25  families, they had so asked for a ward   organization and we feel their circumstances  would justify granting their desires.

 Feb 12 5    Prest. Wilford Woodruff  Salt Lake City    Dear Brethren,    Our Stake Conference  was held Sunday and Monday 10 & 11th.  when we had present Apostle Heb.  J. Grant and President Jon. G. Kimball.  There Brethren imparted much  good council and administration to us  especially on the word of wisdom and  as to guarding the youth of our wards.  The Saints realized and sensed the  importance of all that was said to  us in there matters and we look  for an increasing conformity to the laws  of the Lord among us. We have had  a good deal of sickness and some deaths.  The weather was seasonable and all enjoyed  the conference very much. Temporally  we are being prospered notwithstanding the low  price of products.    Your Brethren in the Gospel    T E Ricks  Wm F Rigby

 Dec. 4 [189]4    Prest. W.

We are doing  our best to continue the academy but under  this load feel it quite a struggle. If it  is not inconsistent with circumstances  we would ask if you can see your way  to appropriate this amount. With kind  regards We are Your Brethren in the Gospel    T E. Ricks  Wm F Rigby  Jas.

 June 15 [189]5    President W. Woodruff  Salt Lake City    Dear Brother,    Some time ago there was a  move to organize a company of militia  here but we headed it off with the  understanding that you did not think  it was a wise thing to encourage at  that time. There is opportunity again  to move in that direction and we would  like to hear what you have to say in  regard to the matter    Your Brother in the Gospel    T. E.

 June 17th [189]5    Pres Wilford Woodruff and Counsellors  Salt Lake City Ut.    Dear Brethren:  This afternoon we held   a meeting of our Stake Board of Education   as the matter of a suitable person to take   charge of our Sunday School Normal Course   in our Academy this winter was agitated   Several names was suggested but after   mature deliberation ^we feel^ we really are at a loss   for such a one, who in our opinion would   do justice to the position except it be Bro   Willard Johnson of Rexburg.    We find however that Bro Johnson   has been called and accepted a mission   to the Southern States to leave home   August next.    We desire to submit the matter to   you and ask your early consideration as t [page torn]  had you would advise us to do in the [page torn]  matter and whether you think it would [page torn]  [illegible]ll to release Bro Johnson and this [page torn] 
 ok or not.    We were sorry to hear that Bro  Johnson had been called from us, as   we had fully depended upon him  helping us and very materially in our   Sunday School work, he having taken  a course of study at the Provo Academy  for that purpose at the expense of our  stake    We are willing however to submit  to your wishes either way as also is  Bro Johnson and awaiting your early  reply in the premises, which whatever  way you decide will be appreciated  by us and remain    Your Brethren  T E Ricks  Wm F Rigby  Thomas E Bassett  [Stake] [illegible]

Smith and President  B. H. Roberts of the Seventies. We had a  large attendance and very enjoyable time  throughout. The health of the people is  good and the blessings of the Lord are  attending our labors. Brother Smith  attended to the division of our stake in accordance  with instructions in your letter to which  we read. The new organization was completed  with all its officers, it is named "Bingham  Stake" and embraces all the wards of that  former part of Bannock Stake south of  the south fork of snake river.

 April 15 [189]5    President W. Woodruff  Salt Lake City    Dear Brother,    We have thought best  to organize by your permission a  ward of what is now Teton Island  Branch. It is a district of country about  3 miles square with about 180 souls.  At our last High Council Meeting  we decided to recommend George A.

 April 24    President Wilford Woodruff  Salt Lake City    Dear Brother,    Enclosed we send you a  letter addressed to you from Daniel A.  Miller of Parker in response to your  call upon him to go on a mission to  the Southern States. Bishop Carbine who  endorses said letter also says in regard  to Brother Workman who also has been  called from Parker ward that Brother  Workman has answered your direct that  he will go but the Bishop does not  think he should for the reason that  he is 60 years old in July and his health  is not good one lung is nearly gone and  he takes cold very readily.

 Sept. 9 [189]5    President W. Woodruff  Salt Lake City    Dear Brother,    Our quarterly conference  was held Saturday and Sunday Sept 7  and 8 when we had with us apostle  John H.

 Reservoir  March 11, 1890    Pres. W. Woodruff  Dear Brother:    I have thought for quite a little while time I would ask you  what to do with the papers of the transfer of Lees Ferry. I have  them left with me by Bro. Snow I think and I have met another matter  I thought I must mention to you as I am getting old, or my health is  not good. Bro. B. Young sent me word to meet him at Snowflake as there  were some unsettled Sunset Matters.    Now what on earth I have to do with them if there things unsettled  connected with that company I could not tell for the life of me, as years  since I, as perhaps you will recollect, I turned over to receivers every  dollar I had belonging to that Co. and positively declaired having  anything to do in the settlement of the business of the Company.    But Bro. Snow instisted that I shold meet with the committee.  I did so and they almost entirely ignored me in the business which was  more pleasant to me than to have been a connected with it.    I did know more about the business of the company than any person  living but NOW I positively know nothing and what I am trying to get  at I want you to protect me so that I am moyed & perplexed tith that  disagreeable matter, disagreeable to me because I am sure I was most  shamfully cheated in connection with it.    Is this asking something something unjust or unfair? If so never take  any notice of tithis letter. I have had so much to annoy & Know no more than  I do. I am tired.    There is another matter I want to speak to you about but will not  now. O how keea ^Queer^ I have felt about the situation you folks are in up there  now. dGod help you is the only thing I can think of. All are pretty well.  The Lord bless you for ever. Lot Smith

We do not know anything about the   suitability of the house but apparently   from Brother Hopkins letter you may have   heard more fully from Elders Stevenson  and Cawley: I will say that the branch  was organized Devember 20 last and no  yet very little tithing has come to us.   We will be pleased to hear your mind  on the subject when convenient    Your Brother in the Gospel  T E. Ricks 
 W. Woodruff  June 30 [18]80    Salt Lake City, June 19, 1880.  President Lot Smith, Sunset.    Dear Brother—I received your  letter of June 7, and was glad to  hear from you, but sorry to learn that  you had let that colt kick you in the  face. That is a trick that I thought  you never allowed your horses to do,  but I suppose he being a colt had not learn-  ed the lesson. I hope it will not be a  lasting injury to you. I am glad  to learn that you had a good conference.  I should certainly have been glad to  have been with you. You speak  of the spring crops, etc. It seems  to me that winter has just broken here.  We are now having hot weather. It  has been so cold that corn could not  grow. It stands just on top  of the ground, but it is now begin- 
 ning to grow.    All crops are back-  ward, but we have plenty of water.  I am glad to hear your stock is doing  well, and to learn of a good start on the  tannery, and that it is doing well. I  wanted to know how that bark mill  did. I think you had a good  offer for the fifty heifers, $20 each, but  perhaps they will do you as much   good as the money. Has your  mare Mary got a horse colt? Give my  love to my Indian friends when they  ask about me. J. W. Y. said he  had baptized Tenney Comiaga's son  (I want to say right here that I spoke  at Provo on my Indian visit, and the  reporter published it in the Territorial En-  quirer without my seeing it, and it  was a very incorrect report, represen-  ting me as saying many things  which I did not say. It was a  bad, jumbled mess. I name it 
 here in case you should read it, for I  do not claim it as my report at all.)    I am in hopes someday of  seeing Sunset and other settlements  in Arizona again. Will  you please inform me in your next  letter what those tithing orders are  that Jesse N. Smith has given on  you, for we do not know any  thing about them here in the  Salt Lake office. I want to  advise you and all the settlements  in Arizona to make an annual  report of all tithing to the general  tithing office here, as other stakes  do, for it will remove all chance  of prejudice against those who  are living in the United Order.  But we do not know where those  tithing orders are from, nor who  has given them, that you speak  of. 
 I named what you wrote concerning  answering any calls that President Taylor  might make on you, but he prefers altogether  for you to make up your regular tithing  account annually, and let that be sub-  ject to his order and no more. I was  glad to learn that Foutz and Walker and J. W. Y.  were getting settled all right. Remember  me kindly to Brother Neilson, and say to him  that I got his ferry stock account all right,  which will enable me to give credit to whom due.  It is a general time of health with us, with  few exceptions. Elder O. Pratt's health is  still quite delicate. We expect: Geo. Q.   Cannon with us on Tuesday. I am  always glad to hear from you. Remember  me kindly to all in the fort. Please deli-  ver the inclosed to whom directed, and oblige  your brother in the Gospel.    W. Woodruff 
 Salt Lake City, Nov. 10", 1882.  Dear Brother Lot.    Your letter dated   Dec 1" (you meant Nov. 1") arrived all   safe and I was very glad to get it.  I had not time to say all I thou-  ght about the matter when I wrote;  I did not say that I believed the   reports that were written to Prest. Taylor,   for I consider that I am somewhat   acquainted with you and I have   been satisfied a good while that many   things have been said about Br. Lot   Smith that are not true.  I was   somewhat surprised at what you   said about the Pitkins for they sent   a letter to Prest. Taylor - I do not know   that it was signed by the young man 
 [sideways text] April 12 [18]81  W. Woodruff [end of sideways text]    Salt Lake City, [page torn] [April 12] 1880.    Pres. Lot Smith,    Dear Brother,    I received your first letter after you   returned home. I was truly glad to hear from you, and that Jim.  had got well. I have been so overwhelmed since I got home, with   Conference meetings, councils, company day & night that I have hardly   had time to look a wife in the face. I have had no time to write   and have not now, only a few moments. I was appointed at the   Conference the Supt of the Young Men's M. I. Assns for the Terry. & Moses   Thatcher and Jos. F. Smith; Counselors. I went to Ogden on Saturday   to attend the Stake Conference of the Young Men.  I forwarded the Tithing Receipts for the money I brought  from Arizona. I sent back the Order of L. Hatch   as they could not change it. I sent them back to you.  I hope you got them. Half of Farmington and part of   Salt Lake County enquired about you. Your wife from   Farmington called upon me and wanted to know how   you get along. I told them well. The apostles seemed   to appreciate washat assistance you are rendering   to the needy who want bread. I wish also to say   in this connection that the mother of Joseph H. Wil-  kins of St John, she lives in Ogden. He is one of the car-  penters we took dinner with at St John. His mother has heard  that he had nothing to eat but black beans. She wanted to know   if she could not deposit 25 or 30 bus. of wheat in the Tithg Office 
 but by the father stating as I said that   he brought in a new wagon, worth   (I think) $140 and got one of no use   except for old iron etc. and that you held   an iron rod over his head and made   him sign a receipt, fully by force, before   you would let him go.  I did not think  a man would put such a tale as   that in writing without something to make   it out of.  I do not wish you to send   any statement of all your operations to   Prest. Taylor since you have been in the   order, not on my account for I do not   think he would have time to read them   for I think he has now more than he   wants to attend to; but it is well for you to   keep all evidence in your hands to   meet any accusations that may ever be   brought against you. 
 I am much pleased with your nar-  rative of the Echo Canyon war, in the   Contributor.  It is very interesting    This is about all I want to say   at this time.  Give my love to your   wives and children and all the men.  women, & children in Sunset.    You brother in the Gospel,  W. Woodruff    
 and let him [page torn] in Arizona. I talked with Bp. Hunter  about it, and he said he would do it. But I did not know   where he could get the wheat in Arizona, except it was of you.  So I told her to deopposit some wheat in the office and I would   send the order to you and I hope you will do what you can   about it. I think you took a bucket of flour to him, when we   went there. We had a good conference, a large assembly, and the   Spirit of the Lord with us. I want you to give my love and blessings   to all the inhabitants of Sunset not leaving out the sisters and chil-  dren. I have not time now to write upon any thing much only   on business and hardly that. I found my family all well & glad to   see me, as I was them. Please say to Bro Pitkin, I recd his letter &   will write him when I can get time. Give my love to Bro Lake  Brigham City, St Joseph and all my friends who enquire. I judged   from what I learned from your letter that you was not going   to have much trouble on the timber question, which I am thank-  ful for, I shall always be glad to hear from you.    Your Brother in the Gospel W Woodruff 
 Private. I wish to say that the subject came up of our permitting the   young people to be married by the Authorities of the Church in Arizona, without   going to the Temple. And the Council all sustained it where they were so   far from the Temple. And the remark was made, that it would seem neces-  sary to establish a place for Endowments at some future time in   Arizona so that young people could get legally married, without   going so far. I got a telegram from J. W. Y. at Albu-  querque—was buying goods. I hope Bro Tenney will not   mix any Mdse with the St John Purchase. And the Council   wish all Co-op stores to be governed by the Presidency of the Stake. W

 W. Woodruff, Dec. 14, 1880  St. John Mission, 200 families  should go there to settle.  Bishop Udall authorized to   recieve any tithing in Arizona:  for payment of St. John.    Salt Lake City, Dec. 14, 1880.  Mr. Lot Smith, Sunset, Arizona.    Dear Brother—Your letter of Nov.   24th arrived all safe, but I have   not had time to answer it before.  I was pleased to hear that you had a pros-  perous journey to the west and back.  I would have liked to have been with you   at St. George, but could not be. I have   thought perhaps that I might visit St. George   some time during the winter, to attend   to some Church business.    It is a   general time of health with us, with   few exceptions.    C. C. Rich is gaining   some.    O. Pratt's health is quite poor-  ly .    My health is quite good. I  got on the scales the other day. I   weighed 166 lbs., about 4 lbs. more   than I ever weighed before.    My   first wife a week ago had twenty five 
 teeth drawn at one time, under the in-  fluence of ether, which made her sick for 24   hours, and she has had a sore mouth ever   since.    We had the coldest November   I ever saw.    It is more mild this   month.    Geo. Q. Cannon is in   Washington.    I have not heard from   him since he left.    I was sorry to   hear of the bad luck of Brigham City  Saints with their crops.    Are they all   leaving?    Where does Brother Lake go?  How much wheat did you have, and how   much corn?    Bishop Udall of St.  John has been with us to get help to pay   for that place. He supposed, from   Brother Tenney's representation, that the   purchase was made for the Church,  that is, that the Trustee was made   responsible for the payment. This   was a wrong idea entirely. It   was bought for the Latterday Saints   to go there, take possession of the land, 
 Salt Lake City, April, 15, 84.  Lot Smith.  Dear Brother:-    Enclosed you   will find a sheet containing the   apportionment of the various Stakes   in Utah to strengthen St. Johns.  We held a meeting in the Social   Hall last night and called 30   families from this stake; if 20 of   them go I will be satisfied.  I   sent out a copy last night to all   the presidents of Stakes in the Ter-  ritory hoping that they will act   promptly.    I received two letters from A.  M. Tenney who says it is quiet   at present but the enemies are hold-  ing secret meetings and planning   mischief.    I am sending a copy of the   apportionment to Bp. Udall to Jesse   N. Smith to be forwarded by 
 and pay for it, but it has got in such   a fix that the trustee had has had to   stretch out his hand to assist to save   the place.    He gave an order on  the Southern herds for some 275 cows.  Brother Udall conveyed an idea that   you told him that you had 100 cows   held in reserve to help to pay for   that place.    Brother Udall said   he had not received them, and the   question arises, Where are they? I did   not know whether there was any mis-  understanding about it. We want   him to have any Church tithing of any   kind in Arizona, that he can make use   of, until that place is secured and   paid for.    Again, Brother Taylor   has put it upon me to have all the   emigration of the Saints that go to   Arizona, to go to St. John, until there is   enough there to take the land and water   and use it.    Brother Udall said 
 private conveyance, so that he   may know what we are doing.    Prest. Taylor, Cannon, and   several others start for the Iron   works on Wednesday and the   Presidency go on to St. George for   a short visit.    My kind love to all,   Your Brother in the gospel,    W. Woodruff   
 that he met nearly 100 wagons going   to Arizona, but he knew nothing about   them, nor where they were going to, and   thought many of them were going on   their own hook, perhaps to get off by   themselves.    But as most of the emi-  gration will go by Sunset, I want to dele-  gate you to say to them that the counsel of   the Presidency and Twelve Apostles to them   is to go direct to St. John and settle there   under the direction of Bishop Udall   until he says it is enough.    There   should be nearly 200 families settle  there.    There should be men enough to   make use of all the water during   emigration time, or we shall constantly   have outsiders squatting down and   claiming waste water.    We wish   you to say to all emigration of the Saints  who wish to claim fellowship with us,  that we want them to take our counsel   in this matter and go to St. John, 
 instead of going everywhere else, until  that place is settled, and if they will   not do this they cannot have our fel-  lowship.    When St. John is settled,  after it is done satisfactorily, they can   make changes if they wish.    We look   upon the St. John country as being as   good as any part of Arizona, and unless   the Saints possess and control St. John,   there is no Mormon settlement will have   any peace in that territory.    It seems   rather strange to us, the manner in   which the last election was controlled.  Brother Tenney's representation to me was   that the Barth's asked for none of the offices   whatever, only for our people to vote for   the county seat to remain at St. John.   But, instead of this, in the election the   Mormons lost every office in the county.  When I think that they hold the legal 
 majority of votes in the county, I think   our people will find hard work to live   under the control of that class of men   who have held control of Apache County.  It seems as though there was a screw   loose somewhere in that election.  But I feel that we should never rest   until we have full control of St. John   and root out that nest that dwells  there.    If there is any tithing stock,  grain or money in any part of   Arizona that Brother Udall can   use for the payment of this debt,   we wish him to have it.

I felt as though I  wanted to give you a little council  to put some young man onto that  machine next year and not to kill  yourself at that thing of work. I heard  a rumor yesterday that you was very  sick & very low and for that reason  I feel to write this morning to enquire  of you or your family to know how  you are Erastus Snow got a letter a  few days ago from Br Brigham Young He did  not convy an idea that you was danger-  ously sick but I want to know how it is  E Snow sprained his ankle the day he  arived here so he is quit lame.

 Salt Lake City, Apr. 17th, 1883.    Lot Smith.    Dear Brother:    I received  your very welcome letter of March 9th,  which I read with much interest;  it is the only information I have  received concerning Bros. Young and  Grant's travels in Arizona. I have  had three short notes from them, but  they gave me no account of their  travels. Br. Grant spoke of attending  the funeral of your little son.    I feel interested in the labor of  the brethren among the Lamanites of  all that country. The Oribas and  Moquies are very dull and super-  stitious and hard of understanding  compared with the Navajoes, Zoonies,  Lagooneies, and Islatos. I am sor-  ry to hear of so much depredations  from the Apaches; there are some  renegades among them which will

 probably make war untill they are  destroyed, but I hope the body of  them will be at peace.    Bro's. Teasdale and Daulton  have started for the Indian Territory.  Br. Lyman has not started for the  Uintah Reservation yet.    We are all as well as usual  including the Twelve and Presidency.  Mrs. Phebe Woodruff's health is rather  poor but she does all of her house-  work which is too much for her.    Br. Morgan has returned from  the south and he spoke in meeting  last Sunday giving a very good  account of the Southern Mission. The  public mind is much more favor-  able toward us now than formerly.  There are over 100 missionaries in  that part of the vineyard, and but  little opposition.    I am thinking of taking the D &  Rio Grand road to Manassa some  time in June or early summer to  visit the saints there and attend con-  ference; the road goes within three  miles of the settlement.

 SALT LAKE CITY, APRIL 18, 1884.    Dear Brother,    We presume that the statement of the number of families apportioned  to be selected from your Stake to strengthen the settlement at St. John, Ari-  zona, has been received by you and acted upon.    We desire these brethren to proceed upon their journey as soon as they  can possibly make it convenient to do so.    Some of those who are called may prefer to go by railroad, which is  much more expeditious and expensive. We cannot say positively what the   fare will be by rail, but perhaps not less than forty dollars for adults, chil-  dren under ten years, half price. But all this business can be satisfactorily   arranged in this city.    We deem it more prudent, in the majority of cases, for the brethren  to go across country with teams. True, by team it is a long and tedious  journey, but healthful and comparatively inexpensive. Then, when the  brethren arrive at their destination, they have their teams, wagons, harness  and many useful implements to begin to build up homes with and make  their families comfortable.    The proper route for teams will be up the Sevier river, over the divide  via Johnson to the Pahreah (formerly Lee's) Ferry, on the Big Colorado  river, thence to Willow Springs, thence to Little Colorado river, up said river  via Brigham City, Sunset, St. Joseph, Holbrook, Woodruff, Greer's Ranch, to St. John.    Those who desire to go by railroad will travel by the Denver & Rio  Grande Railroad to Pueblo, thence by the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe  Railroad to Albuquerque, thence by the Atlantic & Pacific Railroad to  Navajo Station, which lies about forty miles north of St. John. Complete  arrangements can be made for transportation by railroad, from this city to  Navajo Station, thence by teams to St. John, by communicating with W. C.  Spence, at President John Taylor's office, in this city.    W. Woodruff    Chairman. 
 W. Woodruff    had any little difficulty, they would  come to me with their troubles. I  should like to meet with all of them  once more.    We have had a good conference;  we set apart 107 missionaries the  Monday following many of whom  were for the Southern States. Bro's. Ivens  and Pratt are beginning to baptize  a good many in Mexico. One of  Erastus Snow's sons and Helaman   Pratt are called to go there and  assist in the work.    We are looking for the Commission-  ers to arrive at any time now, but  there is no excitement over them.    We are having our March weather  in April -- it snows, rains & every  few days.    I understand that you have  been East some where for blooded  bulls and stallions. What have you  got? How many sheet [sheep], horned stock &c 
 have you now? I What famalies have  you with you? Do you still keep  up a dairy at Pleasant Vally? Your  will, of course is gone. How do you  get your lumber?    I am asking too many ques-  tions but by visiting that country I  feel interested in such questions.    As ever    Your Brother in the Gospel,    W. Woodruff

 Woodruff April  21 [18]80    Salt Lake City, April 21, 1880.    President Lot Smith.    Dear Brother—I have a good  many things I want to say to you  with my pen, but up to the present  hour I have found but very little  time. We have been in either coun-  cils, conferences, or meetings, of some  kind, ever since I came home. I  wrote to you on the 12th and sent the ti-  thing receipts and a letter to J. W. Y.  Since then I have received a letter from  J. W. Y., saying they were buying goods at  Albuquerque for Young, Christofferson,  and others. He also spoke about taking  a contract on the railroad for our people.  President Taylor and myself telegraphed  back that the Co-op. stores should be under  the direction of the presidency of the stakes  and those who furnish the money. 
 Salt Lake City, Mar. 23rd, 83.    Bro. & Sister Lot Smith:    I have just   received your letter containing the   painful news of the loss of your   little son Wilford. I feel to deeply   sympathize with you in your   loss and by such a death. My   oldest son, Wilford is 43 years to-  day. When a child he drank  lye which came very nearly killing   him. His throat grew up so that   he came verynear choking to death   for years afterwards and has   not got entirely over it yet. I   have sometimes thought the name   itself was rather unfortunate; still   I do not think that a name 
 I also got a letter, directed to Brother  Taylor and W. Woodruff, saying that  Brother Tenney had sent an agent  to borrow a hundred cows, to Brother  Flake, to make a payment this  spring on the St. John purchase.  Brother Hatch wanted the council to  furnish Brother Murdock or bearer  $1,000 for Brother Flake, and for  Brother Flake to furnish that amount  of barley to Brother Hatch for the people to  sow and make bread of. But the coun-  cil did not wish to do it. The coun-  cil has decided that the presidents of  stakes and bishops furnish Brother A.  M. Tenney, as a loan, what tithing  stock they may have on hand to help  pay the 100 cows this spring, and we  want to continue to pay for that  purchase until it is settled for, but  we want the people who go there to  pay the debt, and not the church. 
 has anything to do with good   or bad fortune. Truly the loss of   children in that way is painful  but there is one consolation in the   matter—you will have him again   in the morning of the first resur-  rection in your family organization,   of the same age and size that   you laid him away. I hope  you may be comforted in your   affliction. I would like to see   you and your wives and children   once more. Give my kind love   to them all.    I expect that little Lorenzo who   used to help me about my break-  fast is getting to be quite a   boy. I should like to see all   the children of the Sunset fort  once more.    I understand that you went   with Brothers Young and Grant 
 But we think it is necessary to help  about it, so that we shall not lose  the purchase. I thought there had  people enough gone there to raise  the 100 cows this spring. But we  think the church and the branches  in Arizona will be under the ne-  cessity of helping about it, as a  loan, until the place is secure.  I have not had word from Brother  Tenney since I left about St. John on  the mission.    I found my family all well on  my arrival, and we were again glad  to meet. We are having good times in  our Conference meetings and councils.  We are united in our councils and the  spirit of the Lord is with us. There  was a good deal of inquiry about  you at the conference by Farmington  people and others. I hope to hear  from you and know how all is 
 to the Seven Villages. I wish   when you get time you would   give me a little sketch of your   visit among them—how much  time you spent with them, holding   meetings, with what success &c &c.  How did as fat a man as   Brigham get up and down among  them? I should be glad to hear   any information concerning their   visit with you. What are the pros-  pects among the Lamanites and   what is A. M. Tenny ^doing^? What is   the prosperity in your settlement?  Any thing of that kind would be   of interest to me. Give my kind   love to the people of the fort.    Write when you can.    Your Brother in the Gospel,  W Woodruff 
 getting on in Sunset. I miss my  society there very much, especially  those dear children. I want to send  my love and blessing to all sunset, men,  women, and children. I inclose  a letter to J. W. Y., which you will  please forward to him, for I do not  know where to find him. I also  forward in this the order for 30 bushels  of wheat for Brother J. W. Watkins at  St. John. The brethren thought that  as he was a missionary they would  let him have as much wheat there  as his mother put in here. I did  not know but you would be close run  on the wheat question, but whatever  you can do in that line will be a  blessing to him. It is still very  cold here. On the 17th we had  nearly a foot of snow. The mountains 
 are full of snow, and if we were to  have warm weather we would stand  a chance to have a heavy flood.    I want to send in your letter  a few lines to Bishop Lake, of Brig-  ham City, which please send to   him.    Your brother in the Gospel,    W Woodruff    Brother Lot Smith—I would  recommend that when you mark  your lambs that you mark your  tithing lambs for the Church, and  also when you brand your calves  put the church brand on your tithing  calves, and that at the end of the  year you make a report of what  tithing you have on hand, and 
 W. Woodruff  Salt Lake City, Oct. 23, 1882.  Elder Lot Smith.  Dear Brother - I have felt a desire to  write to you for some time past. President  Taylor is receiving letters from persons who leave  your fort and go to other places to settle.  They complain bitterly of your treatment  of them in the settlement of their accounts.  Among others, the Pitkins said that their  property was priced very low when taken  in, and very high when taken out.  They said they gave in a wagon worth  $125, which was priced at $50, and got  a wagon in return good for nothing  but old iron, and he was forced to  sign a bill of receipt with an iron rod  over his head, or something of that  kind. Now of course these   stories are all on one side of the question  But they have their effect against you,  and I would like not to have any  more such stories come to the First Pres-  idency, if possible to avoid it. 
 that this instruction be given to all  the branches in your stake.    Brother Taylor says they get no  report of the tithing in Arizona,  but I told him what had been  paid on the ferry and the tithing  money I brought. Please impart  this instruction to Brothers Lake,  Richards, etc. 
 2  Now I think that a man who has done  as much for Israel as you have in your  day, can afford to be generous with those  who leave your settlement, and let   them have as good as they bring to  you, inasmuch as they get no in-  crease. There is hardly any man  speaks well of you, who leaves your  settlement. They generally go away  dissatisfied. Brother Ira Hatch  was called by the authorities to go to  Savoy, to assist Brother Titien. I have  Never heard of his saying anything  upon the subject. The quorum  of the Twelve have been districting  Utah and the other territories on the  Indian Mission question, but it  has been referred to the Presidency,  and is now in their hands.  We appointed you to stand at the head  of the mission in Sunset Stake, and  Jesse N. Smith in Snowlake Stake, 
 3  and if this thing is confirmed by  the Presidency, there may be some  of the Twelve to visit all Arizona, New  Mexico, etc., to assist in this organ-  ization, as we shall want to gather  all the missionary strength we can  in all those stakes. There is a   great desire to make the Lamanite  mission as effectual as possible  throughout all the territories.  President Taylor has received a  revelation, in which George Teasdale  and Heber J. Grant were appointed  to fill the vacancies in the Quorum  of the Twelve Apostles, and Seymour  B. Young and Abram H. Cannon  were appointed to fill the vacancies in  the quorum of the First Presidency  of the Seventies, all four of whom  have been ordained. We had a  good Conference, strong preaching and  strong testimony. John T. Caine is 
 4  the People's candidate for Congress, and  Van Zile the ring candidate. Now,  Brother Lot, I want you to write   me a letter and tell me how many  families you have got left with you.  How your crops are this season. How  is the Indian question? What is  the prospect of labor among the  Navajoes, Moquis, etc.? How is  your health, and how is your fami-  ly? Give my love to them all.  C.C. Rich was with us at Conference a  part of one meeting. We anointed  him and blessed him. He is some  better, but no prospect of getting well.  We have had a long wet cold spell,  but now it is quite pleasant weather.  Write as soon as convenient and give  me all the news with you.  Your brother in the Gospel  W. Woodruff.  Per J. J. 
 W. Woodruff    Salt Lake City,   Feb. 26th, 1884.    Lot Smith.    Dear Brother.    I received   your letter of Feb. 18th and   I was glad to hear from   you as I always am.   I was sorry to have that  interesting letter get drown-  d and the money too,   but it was better for  that to be lost than for  the man, at least if he   was worth more than a   hundred dollars and he  ought to be.    I would be glad to  visit you again and to  visit your settlements, but  I do not know when   it will be. I would like  to visit your new settle- 
 ments at least the one  in the mountains. I would  like to know what you  are doing with Sunset  are you occupying the  place now; is it your  post office? I see that you  date your letter there. The  Moquis are an innocent  people but I think quite  superstitious in some things.   There seems to be quite  an opening among the   Maricopas and Pimas the   leading men are receiv-  ing the work and I think  the tribes will follow. They  had quite a difficulty  of late with Crismon  and his boys. I think his   boys are hard cases. they   take up Indian stock   put them in the pen and  charge $1 a head and   the Indians put some  of Crismon's cattle in the  pen and charge 50¢ each 
 and the Crismon boys   undertook to take them by  force and threatened their  lives and there would have  been a fight and the Cris-  mon family wiped out if   it had not been for Hinck-  ley, Ray and Hawks, our   missionaries who stopped  the Crismon boys coming  out on the ground to   fight; that family has  made a good deal of  trouble with Lamanites and  Mormons. Br. Young is   visiting in California;  I expect him home soon.   Br. Thatcher has retur-  ned from Washington and  Br. Cannon is on his  way home which leaves  Br. Caine alone. I do  not know what Cong-  ress will do but they are  getting wicked enough   to do anything.    It is a general time 
 Salt Lake City,  Jan. 27, 1881.    Lot Smith,    Dear Brother; I recieved   your letter of Dec. 28, 1880. I have   not been able to answer it before.  I am very sorry for your accident   and hope you will recover from it,   and that you may not be permen^an^tly   lame. I do not hear a word from   E. Snow or B. Young; in fact, do   not know where they are or what they   are doing, but suppose they are some-  where in Arizona.    We learned that Bishop Udell   has crossed the Lees Ferry with all   his stock, all well. I hope he will   have good luck in getting them to   St. John in safety.    I see the editors of the "Dem-  ocrat" seems to have a key to get   knowledge. I know nothing of the 
 of health with us. I am   somewhat troubled with a  cold at present which is   a common complaint  in this country at present.   Br. Fowler who was labor-  ing in the Tithing Office,  died rather suddenly; we  bury him tomorrow. We   are having pleasant  weather overhead but our  streets are very muddy.    Our Legislators are grin-  ding away the best they  can, but I do not know   what they will accomplish.    I spent the most of De-  cember in St. George Tem-  ple and had a good   time and a good con-  ference. I wish you would  tell me by letter how many  you have with you and 
 elections only from Brother Tenny.    I am glad you are so fruitful.  I hope your posterity will honor both   God and their parents.    I think the Navajoes were suc-  cessful on their hunt.    I hope Mary's boys will prosper   as well as the rest.    Remember me kindly to all your   family and all in the Fort.    We got a letter from George Q. Cannon.  He feels well and is boyant in spirit.  Says God reigns, and is thoroughly con-  vinced that Gov. Murry has hurt him-  self and his party much more than   George Q and the Saints.    The Apostles are all well ex-  cept O. Pratt and C. C. Rich. The lat-  ter is gaining very slowly, and O. Pratt  is quite poorly: mostly confined to   his bed and room—is quite weak. But   we hope for the best. 
 what your prospect is for   farming in your new settle-  ment. Are you going to  abandon Sunset; if so will  you move your buildings   to your new settlement? What  will be done with the place  what is done with the mill;  are there any inhabitants in  Brigham City? What is Br.  Lake doing and where is   he?    Remember me kindly to   your Wwives children and   friends, and write when you  can.    Your time [true] friend and brother   in the Gospel,    W Woodruff 
 I am spending a good deal of time   attending quarterly conferences.    We had a very cold November, but   quite open December and January.    Will you please read the enclosed   to the emegration who passes through   Sunset to Arizona and oblige?    We have eight members of the   Idaho Legislature—Joseph Rich the   most conspicuous.    Have the Saints entirely abandoned   Brigham City? What are they going  to do with the place? Has Brother   Tenny left Sunset? Where has he  gone? How is the timber question   with you? Is it settled all right   with the officials?    As ever,  Your Brother in the gospel,    W. Woodruff 
 Salt Lake City, Nov.28, 1882.    President Lot Smith.    Dear Brother - I received your  letter of Nov. 15, and in reading it I  would judge that you had not received  the letter I wrote you Nov. 10. You did  not say that you had received it. I  stated plainly in that letter in a private  note that I did not believe the reports given  about you. It is true, you cannot hin-  der people talking, any more than I can  and I do not care what people say against  one, if they do not tell the truth. I could  tell my enemies a great many failings I  have that they do not know anything about,  but I do not feel disposed to tell them. They  may lie about me as much as they please,  and I suppose they will do the same by you.  I probably did not explain myself clearly  when I said that I did not want anymore  of the stories to come to Brother Taylor. I have  always held uup to all men what you had  done for years in the support of the Saints

I will now say that  the Twelve are being districted throughout  the Indian country. E. Snow and Mo-  ses Thatcher go to Mexico. B. Young  and H. J. Grant go to Arizona. G.  Teasdale to the Indian Territory. L. Snow  and F. D. Richards to all Indians in the  north, as far as wisdom dictates. F. M.  Lyman through Uintah reservation.  I felt like volunteering to go to Arizona.  Brother Taylor thought I was almost too  old, and ought to stay here.( He did not  say to preach to the Indians and heathen  in Salt Lake City ) but I shall have to  attend conferences. I would have  been glad to have visited you once  more in Sunset and the Saints in Ari-  zona. Geo. Q. Cannon started this  morning for Washington with John T.

John Nuttall is  able to be about his house, not to  come to the office. Judge Elias   Smith is barely able to sit in a rocking  chair, he is still very feeble.

 Salt Lake City, Dec 7th, 1882.    Lot Smith.    Dear Brother:    Your letter of   Nov. 28th, is before me, and I feel to say   a little more upon the subject before   us. I wrote to you on Nov. 28th which   of course you had not received when  you wrote last.    I will here explain what I meant   in speaking of Prest. Taylors' not having   time to read such accounts as you   spoke of. Of course he could ^read^ a letter,   but if you sent a history of every man   that has been with you in that order,  what he brought in, and what he   took out, it would be a document   as large as the New Testament, and 
 unless you were on trial for these   things it would not be necessary.    I received a very interesting letter   yesterday from Br. Christian Lingo Chris-  tensen upon the Indian question. The   administration to that lame Indian was   very interesting. The time has come   when we are commanded to turn   unto them and it is beginning to be   a day of God's power among them, and   it is our duty now to go among them.  I have felt to volunteer to go among   them in Arizona and labor with them;   but Br. Taylor rather claimed the right   to distribute us. So he sends B. Young   and H. J. Grant to Arizona & New Mexico.  They will start about Jan. 6th, [18]83 and   visit you and will look to you and   Jesse N. to assist in their labors among   them. E. Snow and M. Thatcher are now   in Mexico, I suppose. F. M. Lyman goes 
 through the Uintah reservation, G. Teasdale   to the Indian Territory, Cherokees, &c. L. Snow   & F. D. Richards attend to the northern   tribes. I shall give my views to Br.  Brigham about his labor with you and   the brethren in that territory.    Concerning Br. Charles W. Stayner, he   has been getting a code of revelations   as big as the New Testament, and   he, himself was to be the great coming   man. Arthur Stayner at first said   it was all from the devil; if he had   stuck to it, it would have been well,   but he finally fell in with and believed   them. Chas. W. has been brought before   a High Council and finally confessed   they were not of God, asked forgiveness  and has been forgiven; now, if he gives   them up, all will be well with him.    Prest. Taylor requires me to tarry   in this country and not go into the 
 W. Woodruff    Indian field. He thinks I am most   too old and then I have the Historian's   Office on my hands and a great deal  of correspondence concerning the temples  and other matters, and he wants me   to attend the conferences in this country.  Br. Taylor and myself with those of the   Twelve who are here are now travelling   two-thirds of the time. We have just  been through Sanpete, Juab, and Utah   counties. We start in the morning for   the north.    Manti Temple is ready to turn the  arches over the upper story windows, and  Logan Temple will be ready for dedi-  cation by next Sept.— it might be by   April if they had means enough. We  are in hopes that the Salt Lake Tem- 
 ple will be up to the square next   fall.    From what I learn I suppose a   part of the county offices in the late   election fell into the Mormons.    I and my family are as well as   usual; the Presidency and Twelve are   also well. L. John Nuttall is around   his house again. Elias Smith is still  very bad, being confined to his bed, and   in great pain most of the time. In   his fall, he feel upon his lame side   and paralyzed his right leg; and it   looks as though it would be months   before he can walk again if he can   at all. Capt. Hooper came near dying   of late. Br. Van Cott is very low with   brights disease. Br. Peck is able to be 
 out again.    Prest. Arthur thinks there has been en-  ough legislation at present for the Mor-  mons. But Gov. Murry thinks differently,   and Murry may attempt to appoint   another Prest.—Van Zile for instance.    Remember me to all with you, es-  pecially your wives and children.    Your Brother in the Gospel,  W. Woodruff. 
 Salt Lake City, Utah.  Nov. 8th, 1883.    Lot Smith.    Dear Brother.    Your very kind   letter of Nov. 1st arrived all safe  and I read a portion of it   in Council yesterday (I left   out that portion concerning my   interest in humanity as my   company might have differed   from you in that sentiment—I   would not read it to them). All   were much pleased with your   account of the Indians. Br. Teas-  dale has returned from the   Cherokee Nation; he has labored   hard for six months and not 
 baptized a soul. Brs. Daulton   and felt are still there but find   it an up-hill business. I would   rather go among the wild Indi-  ans to convert them to the gospel  than among those who are so   much Christianized and priest rid-  den.    I was glad you agreed with   me about your family here.  I   understand they were calculating   to go back, I have not seen   them since.    I suppose that Brs. Young   and Grant are some where in   your country—you will probobly   see them.    We buried Brs. Lewis Robison   and Israel Barlow; we have   buried a good many aged   people during the present year.    We attended Logan Conference 
 on Saturday and Sunday. We  went all through the Temple and   expect to see it ready for dedi-  cation by March. The roof of   the Manti Temple will soon be   finished. Salt Lake Temple is up   to the square—there will be a   few more rocks laid before it   is put aside for the winter.    Brs. Cannon, Richard, and   Caine are at Washington looking   after the business of Zion.    Remember me kindly to   your family and my friends   with you.    Your Brother in the Gospel,  W. Woodruff

 Dear Bro Brimhall: I do not exactly understand  this letter. Bro Miles is on your list of S. S. Normals   but not Bro Sproul.    GR    St. George, Sept. 27, 1898.  Prest. Wilford Woodruff. & Brethren,    I hope you will pardon  us for being a little slow, in   complying with your circular  June the 1st, but after  receiving it we commenced  to feel around, and I asure  you it was a difficult task  to find persons having the  qualifications named in your  conditions, and has got the money  to pay for their board and expenses,  and the only unsual disapoint-  ments in the stock buyers, in  delaying their payments, and  making them good to our brethren  and since then the bottom of our  money matters have fell rights 
 through. No one seems to have a  cent of money, and the y storees  are crowding every one who owe  them a dollar: I suppose these  are the conidtions of the people  all over the nation, but we havn't  been quite asleep.    We have selected two young  men and they were in Provo  at the coommencement of this  term. Fransis Sprowul, from   Washington and son of the Bishop  and grandson of our old brother  Sprowul the singer, and George  Miles of St George, A smart   bright young man, half brother  to the celebrated bro. Miles. also  a university student. 
 We have in our city Mrs Mary  Lund Judd, second wife of  Bishop Thomas Judd, who took  five weeks term in August.  Being quite freehanded and an  experienced hand we thought  her quite suitable, providing you  would call her, without going  again to Provo. This would give   this Stake three, which would  be quite a quorm to start with  Brother Sprowuls boy made arrange-  ments to pay his board in  produce from Dixie. This made us  late in sending you the names, but  we wished to have every certain.  The Residency is agreeable in   this matter. I remain your Bro.    Supt. St. Geo. Stake. R. Morris 
 OFFICE OF  The First Presidency  of the  Church of Jesus Christ  of  Latter-day Saints    P.O. Box B.    Salt Lake City, Utah. Dec. 12, 1894.  189    Elder B. Cluff Jr.,  B. Y. Academy, Provo.    Dear Brother:    Your favor of Dec. 5th has been received. We regret that  any circumstances have arisen to cause you to so write. We believe we  appreciate the good that the B. Y. Academy is doing, and would not do  nor say anything, nor have others do or say anything, that would lessen  its influence for good among the youth of Israel. We are, however, led  to think that possibly you received an exaggerated account of what Bro.  Grant said at the Y.M.M.I.A. Conference, as we understand you were   not present, and had to depend on what others, who were, possibly, unduly  excited, told you. Bro. Joseph F. Smith was present, and did not recog-  nize in the remarks made those difficulties that present themselves to  your mind and those of your associate teachers, and he thought that when,  later in the day, Bro. Grant made an explanation, if not an apology, that  he covered the objectionable features of his earlier remarks. We believe  that you will act wisely in letting the matter drop, as we do not think  the incident was of sufficient importance for you to entertain the  indignant feelings that your letter suggests.    With kindest regards,  Your Brethren,    Wilford Woodruff  Jos. F. Smith

 An account of the mission to the Cherokee,   Creek and Choctam Indians in the   years 1855 to 1860.    At the April Conference held in G.S.L. City  in the year 1855, Elders Henry W. Miller,  Robert C. Petty, Wash ton N. Cook, Wm. Richey  and John A. Richards were appointed  a mission to the Indians west of Missouri  and Arkansas States. They left Salt Lake  valley in May 1855 and reached Mormon  grove in June; after reaching Kaw river  the President, Bro. Miller appointed Bros  Cook and Richards to labor among the Delaware  Indians, the remainder of the brethren went  to the Cherokee Nation, where they reached in  the fore-part of July. They stopped among  a small number of brethren on Spavenaw   river in the Cherokee N., who had come from  Texas, but meeting some of  J. J. Strong's  disciples in the Cherokee Nation, they concluded  that matters were rather wrong in Salt Lake  and located in the C. [] Some of those beth-  ren had been with Lyman Wight and becoming 
 dissatisfied with his course, had left him. Bro. Miller  with his associates soon convinced those brethren  concerning the leadership of the Church and  the majority of them numbering betw. 40 and 50  emigrated to the valley in 1856. In 1858 and   1859 the remaining few of the Lyman Wight followers  located at the same place; among the number are  the Colonel's first wife, who had of late received  a letter from Sidney Rigdon, in which he denounces  the authorities of the Church in the valley and   prophesies evil concerning this people. Elder  Henry Eyring has preached in 1859 to those people,   they however uphold their own views and likely  will until the Lord chooses to interfere in their be-  half.    Bros Cook and Richards who had been un-  successful among the Delaware joined their  brethren in the Cherokee Nation in the forepart  of fall 1855 and commenced their labors in  the Cherokee nation. Mormonism being quite  a new thing in that country the people came  by great numbers ^to hear^ and as a general thing  a good many believed and a few were  baptized. Prest Orson Spencer and Elder James  Mc Gaw came from St Louis to counsell with   the brethren concerning the work in that country 
 and had an interview with the chief of the Cherokees  John Ross, who granted them the privilege to   preach. Prest Miller deemed it wisdom to call  on the St Louis church for some Elders to assist  among the Cherokees and other nations if required.   Subsequently upon the return of Prest Spencer at  a Conference, held in St Louis Octob 6 1855 Elders  James Case, Wm Bricker, Geo Higginson Wm O.  Flavell and Henry Eyring were sent to assist  the Elder on the Ch. Mission. They arrived all   but Wm O. Flavell who concluded to return to  Keokuk after going with the rest as far as  Springfield Mo on the 10th Novemb 1855 at the  settlement on Spavinaw, Ch. N. At a meeting  held in the same place Pres Case, Richards, Bricker  and Eyring were appointed to labor among the   Creek, and Bros Cook and Higginson among the  Choctaw Indians. Bro Miller and Richey  to remain in the Cherokee Nation principally.   Bro R C Petty was in very poor health and  finally died Feb 1st 1856.   Bros Richards and Bricker andon their way  to the Creek Nation stopped at the house of   Some Cherokees (Wm Burgess and family)  Mrs Mary Burgess an old lady was at the   point of death and was given up by the doctor 
 4  and her children to die. The brethren administ-  ered to her and the Lord raised her up   and she and most of her family subsequent-  ly were baptized. December 31st 1855 Bros  Case and Eyring arrived in the Creek Nationand   commenced to lay the foundation for the work  in that country. Bro Case and Richards went   to see the chief of the Creeks, Gen [] Rollie McIntosh  who thought that there were already preachers enough  in the country and there was no need of any more.  He however did not forbid us to preach. The  winter in the forepart of 1856 was very severe and  the Elders on that mission being obliged to labor  for their board, suffered to a good extent.  At the opening of spring they receieved their   labors and were syccessful in baptizing   some. Bro Eyring baptized an Indian   Town chief, who through his influence inclined  a number to be baptized The same spring  Bro Case organizied a branch called Princes  Creek branch Creek N.; at present they are   not fully organized in that locality; the first  Prest resigned, the 2nd died and the third  apostatised and the fourth resigned; they now  have a teacher and meet ocasionally for   worship. In April 56 Bro Eyring having received   an invitation, made a trip into the Cherokee   Nation and baptized 6 in the course of  the summer and ordained one Elder, one   of those bapitzed was aged 145, he  lived 2 years after his baptism and  died in the faith. Several were also added 
 by the other Elders and a branch organized on  Priors Creek Cher. N. in the summer of 1856. Those  connected with that branch have removed to  another locailty and the branch was dissolved.   Sickness now made considerable []  upon the Elders, they were all take with the []  and fever and at a Conference held on Priors  Creek Octob 6th 1856 there was not one of them  in the enjoyment of health. Bro Miller being  released, appointed Bro Cook Prest of the mission  and released Bro Case who was then quite   low. Bro Bricker had previously recieved  leave to visit his wife in St Loudis and had left  before Conference, but never returned and  since has denied the faith. Pres Miller and   Case left in November 1856 and returned to the  valley in 1857. - Bros Cook and Higginson  returned in Oct 56 from the Cherokee nation,   without being able to baptize any. That  Nation has since been left without Elders  with the exception of 2 trips which Bro  Eyring made there in the summer of 1859  without having any success apparently.   In October 1856 an order was issued by the  Chief of the Cherokees for all Mormon   
 Elders to leave the nation forthwith. Thus all   united to labor among the Creeks with the  exception of Bro Richey who remained among  the Cherokees unmolested by avoiding public   speaking. Bro Richey has been a faithful minister  to the Cherokees and although unsuccessful  in baptizing any, he has borne a faithful testimony  and considering his age and bodily infirmities  he certainly has done more than many would  do under the same circumstances. Having also been  restricted in the Creek Nation but little was  done for the remainder of the year 1856 by the  Elders. April 6th 1837 a conference was held  in the Creek Nation Bro Cook presiding; Elder  P.P. Pratt present; we had a time of rejoicing  and Bro Pratt experienced himself satisfied   with the labors of the Elders. Bro Higginson  having been requested by Bro Pratt before his  death to see his family in the valley, left in  the summer of 57. The same summer an   order was issued by the Creek council   for all Mormon Elders to leave the Nation.   Bros Cook and Richards left for the Cherokee   Nation where they recommenced their labors  without being disturbed. Bro Eyring was  permitted to stay in the ^the^ Creek Nation on the 
 condition that he be employed to work for   a native. The general excitement against the church in 1857 made it impossible to do  much good and but little was effected ever  afterwards. Pres Cook who won the love and  respect of saint and sinner, after a short but   severe illness died September 24th 1858 of   quick consumption. At a conference held  in the Cherokee Nation Bro Henry Eyring was  norminated and sustained as Bro Cook's successor.   A general work of reformation was then commenced,  and the saints required to be rebaptized  In the year 1859 Prest Eyring travelled in the Cherokee   Creek and Choface nations, and added a number  to the church and organized one branch  (Lehi branch in Cher. N) and one (Nephi branch) in  the Creek Nation. The former branch was dis-  organized, the Prest and teacher emigrating   to the valley. There is one Elder in that   locality who has change of the few remaining   saints there. The branch in the Creek nation   is still organized, the Prest having charge of  all the saints in the Creek Nation.   The number of saints in the Cherokee and  Creek nations was Octob 6 1859 43 in the former 
 and 48 in the latter nation but out of that number   but very few are alive in the cause, the majority  are careless and indifferent. The prospect   to do further good at present being quite slim  Elders Wm Richey and Henry Eyring left  May 23rd 1860 for the valley and reached  Salt Lake City Aug. 29th. Bro Richards  still remains on his own accord in the Cherokee   Nation, not situated however to do much good.    In taking retroactive view over the labors  of the Elders among those Indians for 5  years, it is quite evident that the result  of those toils, privations and hardships  and the sickness of all and the death  of 2 Elders connected with it, is but very  small apparently. But it is to be hoped  that in after years spontaneous fruits   may spring up frrom the exortions of the  servants of God among the seed of   Jacob.-    The Cherokees are to a great extent mixed  with the Gentiles and to some degree   with the negroes. A majority of them  speak the english language and are  in their manners, customs, habits and   traditions similar to if not equal unto   the whites. Quite a number have good  brick and frame houses and have 
 good farms well stocked with negroes,   cattle horses and hogs etc. They are as a   people hospitable to strangers they will   feed and lodge an Elder, but they don't   realize that he has to have clothing to  wear and that they out to contribute  to that portion of his wants; The Elders  therefore were oblihed to labor with their  hands from time to time to obtain those  necessaries. They are politically organ  ized similar to the whites, having a   1th and 2nd chief upper and lower  house of represaentatives, judges, courts   and plenty of lawyers, which by the  bye is no essential benefit to any  country . Wickedness is on the in-  crease among them; murders are com-  mitted almost every week. Much  excitement also prevails on a/c of the   slavery question.    Their country is excellent for farming,   timber as grass are abundant.   The full blooded Cherokees are generally   indolent and farm on a very small  scale, many however raise cotton 
 and sheep and spin, dye and weave their  own clothing. They have some steam and  water power mills in operation. -    The Creeks are less united with the Gentiles   but more with the negroes than the Cherokees.   They are as respects good houses, farms  and general improvements behind the  Cherokees, murder is but seldom committed  (although on the increase) and generally speaking   the Creeks are more peaceable, but less  enterprizing than the Cherokees. Their political  organization is similar to that of the Cherokees  but remains a good deal of yet of old customs  and traditions. Some have extensive herds  of cattle numbering a thousand head   and upwards, also ponies by large quantities.    Sectarianism has been disseminated  among both nations to a great extent  and although much has been said  against the Elders by them yet they have  used no violence to them all most   understanding some having made threats   to that effect.    The Cherokees at present number about  16000 the Creeks near about the same.

O'klok in the   afternon and I fell asleap and sleapt   betven one and two hours the dream  is this, I dreamt that I saw a   great big Bilding the largest that I   ewer saw the wals was up and the  Roof was on but a great deal of work   was yat to be done there where so  manny arches of wood and of bricks and  so manny brases and stais wherewer I   lockt that I tought I newer saw anny-  thing like it before & I also had to work   in this Bilding this made me feel verry   Temed to think of working in such a   large Bilding and I Tought everybody   wold be locking at me but as I locked  around to se the workmen that the had   ther I thought that I was just as good   a mason as the had there so I tock kurig   and went after my tols as I tought that   I had laid them in a Corner of the bilding 
 but it semed that my tools wher a   littel diferent to wat the had there  and al the Peopel in the Bilding tur-  ned around to lock at me but for al   it semed that I was sent there to work   and cold not get out of it but I   had it to do and I cold se the nesesety   for ther was a great deal of work to   do and werry few to do it, and I woke    This dream gave me enkurigment   and I wondered but felt much better  than I had preveasly done acording to   my interpetation of this dream I tought   it suted my circomstanses the Bilding   being the Churh the arches brayses and   stays the Holy skriptures to seport the   Bilding and also seport me in my   administration or work in the bilding   I being a mason by trade my tools be-   ing the langwig  wich was not werry   esey to get along wiht for I was a  strainger in my own land    I find in traveling among the Peopel 
 that the do not care about our religion   as the can find a much esier way of   going to Heven than we teach them   and that is the say the Lord have   done al for them He has died for ther  ^since^ and al the can do is to sin this faiht  to my astonihment have almost taken   the lead of the Peopel in that Land but   stil we are doing a littel a few is be-  ing added to the Churh by Baptisim  I wil her make mention of a remarkebel   insedent as hapened at Trelleborg a seatow^n^  on the sothern costs of Sveden a yong   women having aplied for Baptisim   and no other plase but the sea the wind  had been bloing hard al day and the   waves was roling heavy the yongman   as was to administer the ordinance I   told him to be verry carful so that   the waves do not take you bought under   but to our astonishment the waves   went down and the water stod per-  fektly stil and the sea was smoved 
 for about a rod al around them and   as the come up the sea come gust   a roling after them and wold dash  up upon the land from tvo to fifeefive  yards ther was present seven persons  tvo of whom was not in the Church   and as the al remarked ^to me^ the had never   seen anything like it before this aswal   as manny other mannefestations of the   power of God made manefetst before my   eyes have strengtened my faith in the  work that I am engaged in I have also   seen the Power of God made mannefest   in several instanses in heling of the sick   under my hands not onely in Sveden   but right here at home as my yongest   Child have almost been raised from the   dead gust before I started on my mistion   he them being about tvo yars old and is   stil living    I have traveled on fot nearly tre tousand   miles and atended one hundred and seven-  teen metings Blesed one Child Baptised 
 nine confirmed eleven ordained one   Elder and Two techers.    The persekution is not so great as it use  to be in that land we have a right to   Preach but not to administer anny of aur   ordinanses but thees things we genorally   find a time for although the laws them-  selves are not so much changed but the   Peopel have grown more careles than the   was in the first rise af the Church in   that contry we are sometimes abused  a littel af the people wiht the tong but  that is nothing for that al slides af  as I am satisfied that som persekution  in some shape fmust follow the blever  I do not know but wahat a littel af   the condition and circomstanses af the   saints ther wold proberbly be af some   interest as I have traveled and seen   every famely and saint in that com-  forence wiht the exseption of one or two   fameles ther is wery few acording to   the condition of afairs at present that 
 wil ewer geat means anef to gather to   Zion and it seems ther greatest desiers   are to al the time how shal we get to   Zion I have told them if the wold be   fathful and do ther duty that the way   wold be opened for them in some way   but some af them seem to think that   the time is going and a great manny  af them are pasing away without get-  ting ther blesings and anointings but I  wold tel them that if the had been faith-   ful the wold in no ways lose ther reward   manny af them have been in the churh  from 12 to 20 yars and have ther done   ther dutes in paing ther thithings and   upheld the Elders that have been sent  to them the condition af the saints in   that contry is realy worse than I had  anny idear af, having been away from   ther so long but after getting more  aquanted wiht afairs it was astonishing   to know how the live wages being ver-  ry low last harvest. A man wold get 
 one krona a day or about 25 sents in our  monny and wemen half that amount and   prvitions is as high there as it is here  but laber is verry much saught after  even at that as a great deal af laber-  saving mashinery is being intreduced  so that it takes the laber away from   the poor man for instance in my   youht. itA man wold stand and trish   al day winter wiht the flael but now  is done wiht mashines and a great deal  af the laber done by wemen as it is  much cheper than men it is astonishing  to see the wemen that is employed in   out dor laber you wold almost think  that the had no men    It was told me before I emigreted   to this contry that we Mormons so   caled was coming to America to be  slaves it is true I have workt hard  as I told them ower ther but I cold   see how I in time cold better my   condition in life, the cannot see

 612 Fan Ness Ave.,  San Francisco, Oct 12, 96.    The President of the Church of Jesus Christ of L. D. S.   Salt Lake City, Utah.    Dear Brethren:    Sunday the 4th inst. we held our semi-annual conference  here in San Francisco. We had a very delightful time. We had a full  house at each of the three meetings. Much interest was manifest. The  Elders have gone to their fields of labor with renewed determination  all feeling well and enjoying good health. We had three applications  for baptism last night. We had a crowded house.    It seems that we are meeting with some success here in San  Francisco than elsewhere. We don't feel the opposition of our enemies  so much here as we do in the [blank] places.    I haven't yet received a receipt of the tithing report sent in  Sept. 2nd.

It was received with pleasure, yet I hate to leave  the many friends here. I cant say that the release was a surprise as I  have felt it for some time and I feel that it was the Lord's will for me  to return, though my best energy would have been spent in furthering the   cause had I remained. I hope to always be doing all that is required of   me. I am very thankfurl for the kind expressions your favor contains. I   shall explain everything pertaining to the Mission to Brother Nye before  I leave him. I will leave Tuesday for San Francisco where I hope to meet   my successor and establish his in the work of the mission.    I desire to leave every thing in a proper condition. I would not be  satisfied to leave with a burden on the Mission for my successor to carry,   so I will send a report of the Mission up to date, and I hoep that satis-  factory arrangments can be made for me square up all accounts here before   I leave.

 612 Van Ness Avenue  San Francisco, Cal. Sept. 29th, 1896    Pres. Wilford Woodruff  Salt Lake City, Utah    Dear Brother:    I returned from Sacramento and Latrobe last Thursday. We held  some very successful meetings and were well represented by the press.  We have just added six more to the church. There is a gradual increase  in all of our congregations, yet we have plenty of indifference to  contend with. I received the tracts and Voice of Warning you sent  by the Elders.    I have been waiting anxiously for definite word about me staying   in the mission. My wife is not enjoying very good health and being  whooly dependent upon others, it is almost more than she can do to  care for herself and three litttle ones. If you decide for me to  remain here and it be consistent with your feelings I would like   to have my family with me. But that would increase the expense and  add unto your burden and it makes me feel that perhaps it would be  better for you to send some one who is able to bear the expense. There  are Elders who would carry the mission successfully if they could come  and stay with me a little while until they become familiar with our  methods and I believe it would be well to consider it before you de-  cide to keep me. However the matter rests wholly with you. I am  willing to do as you say and do my best to further the cause whether  here or elsewhere.    Perfect harmony exists among the Elders and we are enjoying our  labors, but we have some unpleasant things occasionally among the  members. The other power has been working to divide our flocks but  so far all little troubles have proven a benefit to us. I have just  released Elder B. W. Henderson on account of the financial depression.  He is a member of the Henderson and Sons firm at Oneida, Idaho, and  is an excellant young man with good judgment. He has been in the   Mission 19 months.    When I sent in my report on the 2nd inst. the mission indebted-  ness was $114.18. I borrowed the money of Bro. Scowcroft to carry me  along but another month is almost gone and rents are due. I hope you  will be able to make an appropriation of $150.00 for the benefit of  the mission.    We will hold our northern conference here next Sunday, October 18th  we will hold our Southern Conference in Los Angeles. I hope to leave  for there about the 12th. Brother and Sister Scowcroft will accompany me  south. I expect to be south two and one-half months. I will leave 
 estimate approximately at 25.00, if I get away in two weeks which I think   sufficient time to stay. My ticket to Frisco will be $10.00 and I would  be glad to return by Portland which would add $10.. to the home trip,   making it $29.00 to Salt Lake, whcih will make immergent expenses amount  to $150.00. If you will send me that amount I can settle the Mission  expense and get home at the end of the expected time. I have borrowed what  money I have needed here for the Mission expense which is included in the  above amount.    Please write me at your earliest convenience at 612 Van Hess Ave.,  San Fransisco, and let me know if it meets your approval for me to return  via Portland, and if I can do anything for you while here.    I have put the Richards matter in the hands of Elder Millard Scoveroft   who is a thoroughly competent business man and he will report to you the   outlook of the Richards claim and his proposals.    I hope to receive a receipt of the above tithing account and also a   check to balance the mission expenses as soon as convenient.    We held our conference here in Los Angeles the 18th ulcimo, where  very encouraging reports were made. Our meetings in the south have not  been largely attended though we look for better opportunities now the  political confusion has ended for a season.    The elders are well organized in the two conferences under the imediate  direction of Presiding Elders of experience so that Elder Nye, if he feels  that our plans are good ones, can easily direct the mission and continue  the plans already adopted with out trouble.    The Elders will all give Bro Nye their support and I feel that great  good will be accomplished. Hoping to hear from you soon, and that are  long I will have the pleasure of seeing you. I am very thankful for the  support I have received and above all that I can feel in my heart that I  have filled my mission in honor. My prayers will continue with the work  though I may have to deal with sterner realities.    May God ever bless and prosper you and the people under your ^watch^ care  is the prayer of your humble servant.    Your brother  (Sgt)  Henry S. Tanner 
 Elder Henry Peterson in charge here when I am away.    I hope all is well with you and that I may hear from you at  your earliest convenience.    We look for more success here as soon as the political kettle  settles a little.    With kindest remembrance to you all, I remain    Your brother    (Sgd)  Henry S. Tanner

We think when Trustees  in our several wards having such  property were elected, meetings for the  purpose of election were called by  means of blanks you furnished us.  We are out of the blanks, will you  kindly send us some and necessary  instructions and oblige    Yours truly  Jas Gillespie

Dear Bro:  Having returned from a mission   to the Southern States without the   privilege of meeting with or visiting   any of the Apostles I thought I   would write you a few lines that   you might know of the safe arivel  of My myself and Elder J. S.  Cram of Kanab.  It was my   desire to report to you in person  but because of the illness of Elder   Cram I was instructed by Prest  Elias S. Kimball & Prest. S. P.  Oldham of the S.C. Conference  to see to his safe arival at  Bel-  nap station on the Riogrand Western 
 Ky. six miles above here, where his   folks would meet and take care   of him. Before we reached here   we learned, that his folks were   waiting for him at Belwah, and   as he had improved ^in health^ some on the   journey he thought it unnecessairy   for me to go on with him to that   place.  I was set apart for a miss-  ion to the Southern States Feb 22nd   1895 and started out on the following   day. On ariving at Chattanooga  Tenn. I was appointed to lavor  in the S. C. Conference. In company   with Elders Bond Stephenson &   Fortie I want to Columbia where   we met Prest Beatie I first labor  ed with Elder G. S. Bralley in   Chester Co. then with Elder J. F.  Hyatt in York Co. After conference   which was held in Williamsburg   Co. in the month of October I was sent   with Prest. S. P. Oldham to open up Barn

THE TEMPLE, SALT LAKE CITY.   S. C., 189    well Co. I remained there until Aug 1896.  My next field of labor was York Co  which place I continued untill my   release which was June 23. 1897.    Because of false reports the people of   York Co are generally very much oppos-  ed to Mormons and Mormonism untill   it was often that we could not get to talk   or hold meetings with the people as we   would have liked. But with all I think   a greate deal of prejudice has and will   continue to be alayed. Twenty or more   persons have been united to the church   since Elder Hyatt and I went to that   Co. and I think there are several   others amongst the first friends that   the Lord raised up to us that will come   into the Church before very very much longer. 
 We have near Blacksburg (which place was in York Co but is   now cut off and forms a part of Cherokee Co) a Sunday   School with about forty members.    My health was very good the most of   the time.  While traveling I was greately bless-  ed and protected of the Lord and   have received many testimonies that the   work is of the Lord. These blessings   and testimonies will be given to every   elder that will do the best he can however   weake he may be.    I believe the S.C. Conference is in a   thriving condition and will no doubt   continue to prosper for I believe the   elders do desire and are trying to carry   out council. Wall Dear President   I feel that I have not lost anything   by going on this mission and if there is   any other labor the Lord desires me   to preform with His blessings I  hope to be able to preform it.  May the Lord help us to preform every   duty and labor and keep us in the faith   is the preayer of    Your Bro.  J. W. Parker.    The receipt of this letter should be kindly ackn-  owledged, and the letter should be filed at the H.O.  J. F. S. 
 July 30 [189]7    President W. Woodruff  Box B  Salt Lake City  Utah    Dear Brother,    For some time past we   have been trying to discover some   good method to adapt in this stake   to bring our people closer together. We   have felt that politics have scattered them   in such a manner as to bring much   injury to many of those who should be   more closely commited with all our   church organizations and in watching our   local newspapers we see them filled from   week to week with nothing but political  quarrels. Our people are great readers   of the local papers and we are of the   opinion that if a local paper were started   here under the direction of the Presidency 
 of this stake with some of our leading bishops,   have it free from politics and devoted to   the upbuilding of our stake and the organizations  of the church, it would do more towards   bringing our people together and creating   a better feeling among the people of the   various wards than any other one thing   we could do just at present. But before   doing anything in the matter we have   felt that it would be our duty to   write you regarding the same and   ask if it would meet with your   approval. If you have no objections   we would like to try the adventure.  An early answer would greatly oblige    We are   Your Brethren in the Gospel  T E Ricks  Wm F Rigby  Thos. E. Bassett

Dear Brother:    It gives us pleasure to inform you that we have appointed  Elder Ephraim Nye to succeed you in the presidency of the California  Mission. You will therefore please transfer to him all books, papers,   accounts and whatever else is necessary to enable him to satisfactorily  take hold of the business of the Mission as well as of its spiritual   concerns, at whatever date is most convenient to you both; you will also  give him all the information necessary to enable him to assume the   duties of his new position in the most acceptable manner. You will then  be at liberty to return home whenever you deem it most proper.    While thus releasing you from the many and varied respon-  sibilities connected with this mission, we feel to say that your earnest  and devoted labors in the presidency are appreciated by us, and we   trust that you will continue to be highly blessed of the Lord in all your  duties after you return to your home and friends in Zion.

 [OF]FICE OF  The First Presidency  of the  Church of Jesus Christ  of  Latter-day Saints    P.O. Box, B.    Salt Lake City, Utah. Oct. 14, 1893.    Prest. W. T. Stewart,  New Zealand.    Dear Brother:    Your favor of Aug. 12th reached our office while we were  absent at the World's Columbian Exposition at Chicago, or it would have  been answered by the last mail.    With regard to the matter—the emigration of some of the  Maori Saints—that occupies the most prominent place in your communication  we will say that, as you are aware, we have hitherto felt reluctant to  encourage the wemigration of any of this people from their native islands  to Zion; our experience with our Kanaka brethren and sisters not having  been altogether encouraging; but after perusing your letter and learn-  ing therefrom their characteristics, their industry and capability for  such work as is incidental to the opening of a new country we have felt  that a limited number of the best and most capable brethren and their  families might at the present be permitted to gather, such ones as you  and your associate missionaries would deem most suitable to meet and  overcome the difficulties and peculiarities of so great a change in their  mode of life as would be incidental to their removal to the^se^ mountains.  Neither do we think it would be well to treat them as our emigrants of  the white races are treated—permit them when they reach here to make a  way for themselves, locate where they choose and provide for their  necessities as seems best to their judgment. We believe that it will be  desirable to have our Maori friends placed in the charge of some one or  more of the brethren who know their language and who have love and 
 sympathy for them as a people; and further that they be advised to settle  in some district or region of our country where the climate is as suitable  to them as can be found, and the natural productions consistent with the  modes of life that will be most advantageous to them. In considering this  matter, we have come to the conclusion that Kanab and its neighborhood  will be as suitable for settlement by the limited number that you suggest,  as any other portion of the inter-mountain region with which we are  acquainted.    Such of the intending emigrants as can do so, of those  whom you decide are proper persons to come, should accompany you on  your return hiome, so that they can have the benefit of your counsel and  guidance on the way. Further, we should be pleased to have you continue  your supervision over them when they reach their future home, that they  still may have a father to look to for the instruction, guidance and  support that they will undoubtedly need. But of the details of this,  and who shall be called to assist you, when such are needed, we can more  fully arrange when we meet you.    It is probable that all the missionaries for whom you  have asked for New Zealand, Australia and Tasmania will not leave by the  November boat. The stringency of the times is such that a number of the  brethren who have been called on foreign missions have not been able to  raise their passage money by the time appointed and their departure has  had to be postponed. So, we have reason to believe, will be the case  with some of those called to labor under your presidency.    We will now say, Brother Stewart, that you are honorably  released, with our approval and blessing on your labors, from the  Presidency of the Australasian Mission, with the privilege of returning  home whenever you consider the best interests of the mission will per-  mit. You will please transfer to Elder William Gardner, who has been  chosen to succeed you, all the books, papers and property of the mission, 
 and aid him in assuming his new duties by affording him all the informa-  tion with regard to the churches and their members that lies in your   power.    It has been the custom to require half yearly Statistical  Reports from the various Stakes of Zion and from the Foreign Missions,  but at our last General Conference, it was decided that in future an  Annual Report made up to December 31st of each year would better answer  the purpose. In the past the reports have, in many cases, been incomplete  covering various periods of time, and ending at almost every day of the  calander year. This irregularity has robbed these reports of all  reliability regarding the facts which they are intended to represent and  made them misleading rather than trustworthy. It is hoped that this  change will not only secure uniformity but completeness also, if an  effort is made by the Secretaries and others, whose dutiy it is to attend  to these things, to have them as perfect as possible. You will therefore  make your next Statistical report include the period from the date of  your last report to the end of this year, and annually thereafter.    The brethren chosen for Tasmania are Elders F. W. Ellis  (North Ogden) and Lysander C. Pond (Pocatello). Elder Ellis is a man of  fine ability, lengthy experience and a good singer. He is about 40  years of age. Elder Pond is a younger man, also well recommended. He  has written for permission to have his wife accompany him, stating that  she was a young woman admirably adapted for missionary work. We wrote  back that Tasmania would be a hard missionary field for a sister, but if  he still desired it, we would not object. At this writing, we have not  learned which way he has decided. Two of the other brethren will be  instructed to secure tickets for Sidney, and on their arrival you can  change the field of labor of any or all of them as you, from your  knowledge of the needs of the mission, may deem best. 
 With love to yourself, your fellow missionaries, and all  the Saints,    We remain, Your Brethren,    Wilford Woodruff  Geo. Q. Cannon  Jos. F. Smith 
 Salt Lake City, 8 April 1891    Elder William T. Stewart,  Kanab.    Dear Brother:    Your name has been suggested and accepted as a Missionary to  Australasia—to preside in that mission.

 Mar 8th [189]8    Pres Wilford Woodruff  Salt Lake City Utah    Dear Brother    We quote the following   extract from a letter from Bp. Wm. B. Preston to us   under date of Mar 1st    "We beg to inform you that in the future we   can not allow the Tithing Department to be charged   with the expense of buggy for Pres. Ricks, as also   the feed and care of horses for him.  These items   must be eliminated from the amount of 1898 unless   permission is given in writing by the First   Presidency"    A word of explanation as to what we have been  doing in this particular might not be out of place  We have on hand a large two [axled] buggy that   was furnished for our use a few years ago under   the direction of Bp Preston.  We also have a buggy   harness here belonging to the Tithing Department  Bro Ricks has furnished his own team gratuitously,  but the expenses of feed, repairs, horshoeing etc have   been charged to the general expense account of our 
 Stake office. We estimate that between Fifty and   Fifty Five Dollars on Hay and Grass has been fed  the team and about Twentyfive or Thirty Dollars   in repairs sharing etc per annum has been expended  in keeping the outfit in a reasonable condition for   service.  Our reasons for so doing are that our   stake is so large that we felt that we could not   do justice to our duties in our official capacity   unless some convenience of this nature was provided.    While we have your attention we beg to state that  under existing instructions we feel somewhat delicate   in drawing anything on our customary appropriation  until receiving your order to do so. Should it meet   your approval an order for the amount usually   allowed Pres Ricks and Rigby would be appreciated   Brother Bassett feels in a condition to get along   without any for the present at least.    I shall be pleased to know your minds on both   matters mentioned above whenever convenient for you   to favor us with their consideration. With Kindest   regards we remain Yours Very truly  T E Ricks  Wm F Rigby   T. E. Bassett 
 Jany 28 [189]8    Pres W. Woodruff  Salt L. City Utah    Dear Brother:    We enclose herewith   communication from Elder Don. C. Driggs  explaining itself.  If the arrangements are as   he states we have a misunderstanding of the case    Our impressions were that no one of our   missionaries to Montana were to be called for   only three months with the exception of those   who had previously had an experience in the   missionary field.    When Bro Jone Henry Smith was here   at our late Stake Conference Bro Drigg's name   was suggested for a mission to Montana but   on account of his business interests he was   allowed a certain length of time to make the   necessary preparations.    We are not posted as to whether any   other arrangements have been made by Bro John   Henry or yourself, and would be pleased to know 
 as to whether such is or is not the case so as to   be able to explain your wishes to Bro Driggs  and give him the necessary information as to   his Railroad permit, License, setting apart etc  upon his arrival here on Monday next   also as to whether his call is for three months   only.    With best wishes we remain    Your Brother   T E Ricks  T. E. Bassett

 Mar 15th [189]8    Pres Wilford Woodruff and Counselors  Salt L. City Utah    Dear Brethren:    I am in receipt of a   communication from Elder Geo Reynolds under date   of Mar 14th stating that you would be pleased to   learn from me what were my legal and other reasons   that caused me to look with disfavor on the   effort to remove the County Seat from St  Anthony to Rexburg.    My legal reason is in Sec 2 Art 18   of our State Constitution which reads as   follows.    Sec 2 3 county seat shall be removed   unless upon petition of a majority of the   qualified elctors of the county and unless two   thirds of the qualified electors of the county   vote [for] the proposition at a general election   shall vote in favor of such removal. A  [word faded] petition of removal of the county seat  shall not be submitted in the same county   more than once in one year, except as provided 
 by existing laws.    The election that made St Anthony the   Permanent County seat was held in the fall of   1894. With some, I admit it is held that   the six year provision does not apply to the   first removal of a permanent county seat and   that it only refers to a proposition of removal  after a similar attempt has been previously made   Others hold that it would apply with equal   propriety in a first attempt of removal. As to   just how the courts would interpret this is a   question that the future only could decide and   to combat the opposition that would undoubtedly   be made on this technicality in case of our   obtaining the necessary votes would unquestionably   entail considerable expenses and of course with our   favorable chances of losing even then.    A careful canvass of the votes by precinct   at our last election indicated very strongly to   me that it was an absolute impossibility to   acquire the necessary votes for its removal at  the coming election and that an almost super human 
 effort would have t[o] be made to come anywhere   near that number involving an outlay of   thousands of dollars, much valuable time and a   serious division in the good feelings and unity of   our people that would inevitably result from   a contest of this nature.    With the growing sentiments in favor of   Rexburg by reason of our religious and educational   interest and the standing morality of our people and   the waning sentiment in favor of St Anthony   caused by the encouragements to crimes of various ^kinds^  given there and other causes, I felt that our vote   in the future say 2 or 4 years hence would be   stronger and that should ^we^ be successful in then   obtaining the necessary 2/3 vote all legal questions   that now embarras us would be removed  without the expense and annoyance of having to   fight them in the courts.    While at Salt Lake City a few weeks ago   [text faded] see you personally on this matter I left   [text faded] us not only of 6 of the committee of   [text faded] but had been selected to investigate and 
 determine whether or not a contest should be   made but by others of our leading business   and influential men in the hands of Brother   Geo. F. Gibbs, all of whom sustained me in   the cource I took and to which I beg to refer   you for further information on this subject  If however these are not sufficiently explanatory   I shall be pleased to answer any questions you   may desire to ask at any time.    I beg to assure you that my advice on this   matter was only taken after a careful consideration   of all sides of the question having in view the   best good of our people as a whole and with   no desire to harm even the ^an^ hair of the head  of any man.    Hoping that at your convenience you   will favor me with your opinion as to whether   my cource in the premecis did or did meet   with your approval I remain    Yours very truly.  T E Ricks  We endorce the above sentiments and  Coincide with Pres Rick's actions in the foregoing.   Wm F Rigby Thos E. Bassett.

 Feb. 21 [189]8    President W. Woodruff  Salt Lake City, Utah    Dear Brother,    In connection with Bishop  E. Z. Carbine we visited Arcadia Branch  of Parker ward Sunday 13th inst.  The branch has 22 families, a good   lively Sunday school, have built  a comfortable meeting ^house^ 20 x 40 ft. which  is paid for and on the occasion of our  visit we dedicated the house.    It was the general opinion of myself  the Bishop and the unanimous feeling   of the people that they should have a   ward organization. The branch is fifteen  miles apart from Parker ward proper.  The name of the ward was talked of   and decided upon viz: that it should  be called Ora that being the name   of the Port Office. At a High Counsel
