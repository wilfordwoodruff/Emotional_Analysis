I wish to refer to the first doctrin preached  that God in the Revelation called the  ollive leaf it says that "the Devil gathered together the Hosts of Hell And Michael the Arkangel gathered together the Hosts of  Heaven and he overcame the devil and his Angels and this is the  Battle of the Godreat God" who is this Michael the Ark Angel it is Adam who was Michael in the creation of the World. Again in regard to the redemption of the dead I believe it will  take all the ordinances of the gospel of Christ to save soul as  much as another. Jesus himself obeyed all the ordinances of the Gospel that he might fulfill all righteousness. Therefore those who have died without the gospel will have to receive the  gospel in the spirit world from those who preach to the  spirit in Prision, and those who dwell in the flesh will have to  attend to all the ordinances of the gospel for and in their behalf by Proxy and it will take 1000 years with Jesus Christ at the head of all the Prophets and Apostles before the work will be finished in attending to all the ordinances for all the dead who have died without the gospel. Again concerning Revelation I Believe it to be the privilege of Evry Apostle and Elder who bears any  portion of the Holy Ghost and  Revelation to guide them in all things. But I do not Believe that the Lord will Reveal to any man a New Principle, doctrin or Law, to govern the Church and kingdom of God on the Earth Except through the Mouth of the Prophet, Seer, Revelator President and Law given unto the Church, this is his place and position to receive the word of the Lord and give it unto the  people. There are some Joseph held which No other man held while he lived. and there are some  which President Brigham Young holds which No other Man holds the keys of the sealing power for instance But he permits other Apostles to administer in this ordinance   ENDENTRY Jan 24, 1868   Again their is another subject I wish to speak off. There is one subject upon my mind and has been for years that is contra- ry to my Practice and the Practice of this People and that is corncerning the sabbath I have never thought that the Jews or ten Tribes of Israel would Ever keep the gentile Sabbath that is the first  day of the week when I was Baptized into this Church I  was keeping Saturday for the Sabbath. But I knew that  the Later day saints were the tru Church of Christ and if I  had imbibed 100 tradition I would have given them up for  this I dont know as the Latter Day Saints will Ever keep this day and it does not make any difference whether they do or not for the Lord will dictate them Just as he please in all those things. But when Moses received this comm- andment to keep the seventh day of the week The Lord said this  Law shall remain as a statute Betwen me and the House of Israel forever throughout all your Generation I  have Never found this commandment changed By any revelation from God. ##Exodus 20:8-11## Jesus and the Apostles kept the 7 day of the week called the Jewish Sabbath. Yet the Apostles did meet in some Instances on the first day of the week to Break bread andc. Constantine changed the day of  worship from the seventh to the first day of the week  about 600 years after Christ, we received a Revelation in the doctrins and covents in the Early age of this Chirch to Meet upon the Lords day to Break Bred andc. But the Lord did not reveal which day of our time was the Exact diy that the Lord Commanded Israel to keep. At the close of the remarks. President Young read the revelation and  said that there had been so much change in time that we do not know the Exact time that was the seventh day President Young made many remarks upon various subjects    ENDENTRY January 25, 1868 ~ Saturday   25 FIGURES I spent the fore part of the day in the Endowment House we gave Endowments to 46.
