 Nov 24, 1889.  Revelation given to Wilford Woodruff, Sunday Nov 24, 1889.  Thus Saith the Lord, to my servant Wilford, I the Lord have heard thy  prayers and thy request, and will answer thee by the voice of my   spirit. Thus Saith the Lord, unto my servants the Presidency of my church,  who hold the Keys of the Kingdom of God on this earth, I the Lord  hold the destiny of the courts in your midst, and the destiny of this  nation, and all other nations of the earth in mine own hands, and all  that I have revealed, and promised and decreed concerning the generation  in which you live, shall come to pass, and no power shall stay my hand.   Let not my servants who are called to the Presidency of my church, deny  my word or my law, which concerns the salvation of the children   of men. Let them pray for the Holy Spirit, which shall be given them to guide   them in their acts. Place not yourselves in jeopardy to your enemies   by promise, your enemies seek your distruction and the distructions  of my people. If the Saints will hearken unto my voice, and the counsel  of my servants, the wicked shall not prevail. Let my servants, who   officiate as your counselors before the courts, make their pleadings as  they are moved upon by the Holy spirit, without any further pledges  from the Priesthood. I the Lord will hold the courts, with the officers of  government, and the nation responsible for their acts towards the  inhabitants of Zion. I, Jesus Christ, the Savior of the world, am   in your midst. I am your advocate with the Father. Fear not  little flock, it is your father's good pleasure to give you the Kingdom.   Fear not the wicked and ungodly. Search the scriptures, for they  are they which testify of me, also those revelations which I have  given to my servant Joseph, and to all my servants since the world began,  which are recorded in the records of divine truths. Those revelations  contain the judgments of God, which are to be poured out upon all   nations under the heavens, which include Great Babylon. These judg-  ments are at the door, they will be fulfilled as God lives. Leave  judgment with me, it is mine saith the Lord. Watch the   signs of the times, and they will show the fulfillment of  the words of the Lord. Let my servants call upon the Lord  in mighty prayer; retain the Holy Ghost as your constant com-  panion, and act as you are moved upon by that spirit, and  all will be well with you. The wicked are fast ripening in  iniquity, and they will be cut off by the judgments of God.   Great events await you and this generation, and are  nigh at your doors. Awake, O, Israel, and have faith in  God, and His promises, and he will not forsake you. I the Lord  will deliver my Saints from the dominion of the wicked, in mine own  due time and way. I cannot deny my word, neither in blessing nor  judgments. Therefore let mine Anointed gird up their loins,   watch and be sober, and keep my commandments. Pray  always and faint not; exercise faith in the Lord and   in the promises of God; be valient in the testimony of Jesus  Christ. The eyes of the Lord and the Heavenly Hosts are watching  over you and your acts. Therefore be faithful until I come. I come   quickly to reward every man according to the deeds done in the  body. Even so, amen.

Dear Brother:    I am in receipt of yours  of the 2nd inst. and in answer  I will say:    My heart is with the work.  My time is my God's: My  services are also his. But  I regret that my circumstan-  ces at the present make  it impossible for mye to  comply with the present call  with the date affixed.

 and further, I was called a  little better than a year ago.  I responded to the call, came  to Salt Lake City and was  sent back to labor at home,  which I have been doing ever-  since. I was told that my work  for the present would be at   home. I thought from that  that I would not be needed  again soon, for a foreign mis-  sion, and I have not been  making my calculations  for it. I have been buying  some land and other property.  I have sold my home, and at  present I have none, and I   do not think you would ask  me to go and leave my wife  homeless, (for I have been mar-  ried since I was sent back   before.) 
 the help of my Heavenly Father  and by improving my time, I   hope to be able to fulfill an  honorable mission, and that  I may be an instrument in the  hands of God to bring many to  a knowledge of the th truth, of the  Everlasting Gospel, is my humble desire.    I must tell you my present  circumstances. I have not a cent  of money in my possession now  and unless the Lord interceeds in  my behalf (which He will if I  have sufficient faith in Him.) I say   unless He will open up a way for  me between now and the 26th  of March to obtain sufficient means  to take me to my field of labor, I  could not go. I therefore, on the  condition that I obtain money  enough to take me there, cheerfully  accept the mission and hope to be
