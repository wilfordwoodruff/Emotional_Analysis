FEELING an anxious desire for the salvation of souls, we now lay before the world those principles which were taught by our Lord Jesus Christ, and his  apostles; and as we implicitly believe the word of  God, we declare that a full salvation cannot be ob- tained, except through obedience to all the command- ments laid down in the New Testament. Our Lord Jesus Christ, previous to his ascension, gave this commission to his apostles: “Go ye into all the  world and preach the gospel to every creature; he that believeth and is baptized, shall be saved: but  he that believeth not, shall be damned; and these signs shall follow those that believe: in my name they shall cast out devils—they shall speak with new  tongues—they shall take up serpents—and if they  drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them—they  shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover.” Luke (chap. xxiv. 45—50) writes, that he (Jesus)  then opened their understandings, that they might understand the Scriptures, and said unto them, Thus it is written, thus it behoveth Christ to suffer, and to  rise from the dead the third day; and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem; and ye  are witnesses of these things, and behold I send the  promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the  city of Jerusalem until ye be endowed with power from on high; and he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands and blessed them.

I Remain Yours Resp. Alonzo G. Sedgwick.  Henry Rampton Bishop Counselor ENDENTRY AN ADDRESS.  To the Officers and Members of the  Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- day Saints:  The near approach of the date for  the dedication of the Temple of our  God moves us to express with some  degree of fullness our feelings to our  brethren, the officers of the Church  who with us bear the Priesthood of the  Son of God, and to the Latter-day  Saints generally; to the end that in entering into that holy building we  may all be found acceptable ourselves,  with our households, and that the  building which we shall dedicate may  also be acceptable unto the Lord.  The Latter-day Saints have used  their means freely to erect other  Temples in these valleys, and our  Father has blessed us in our  efforts. Today we enjoy the great  happiness of having three of these  sacred structures completed, dedicated  to and accepted of the Lord, wherein  the Saints can enter and attend to those ordinances which He, in His  infinite goodness and kindness, has re- vealed. But for forty years the hopes,  desires, and anticipations of the entire  Church have been centered upon the completion of this edifice in the prin- cipal city of Zion. Its foundation was  laid in the early days of our settle- ment in these mountains; and  from that day until the present,  the eyes of the members of the  Church in every land have been  lovingly directed toward it. Looking  upon it as the Temple of Temples, the  people during all these years have  labored with unceasing toil, undi- minished patience and ungrudging  expenditure of means to bring it to  its present condition of completion;  and now that the toils and the sacri- fices of forty years are crowned so  successfully and happily; now that  the great building is at last finished  and ready to be used for divine pur- poses, need we say that we draw near an event whose consummation is to  us as a people momentous in the  highest degree? Far-reaching in its  consequences as that occasion is certain  to be, what remains for us to say in  order to impress the entire Church  with a sense of its tremendous im- portance!  On this point, surely nothing; yet may we offer a few words upon a phase that directly touches it. No member  of the Church who would be deemed  worthy to enter that sacred house can  be considered ignorant of the prin- ciples of the Gospel. It is not too much  to presume that every one knows what his duty is to God and to his fellow  man. None is so forgetful as to have lost sight of the admonition that we  must be filled with love for and  charity toward our brethren. And  hence none can for a moment doubt  the supreme importance of every member of the congregation being at  peace with all his or her brethren and sisters, and at peace with God. How  else can we hope to gain the blessings He has promised save by complying  with the requirements for which those  blessings are the reward!  Can men and women who are vio- lating a law of God, or those who are derelict in yielding obedience to His  commands, expect that the mere going into His holy house and taking  part in its dedication will render them  worthy to receive, and cause them to receive, His blessing?  Do they think that repentance and turning away from sin may be so  lightly dispensed with?  Do they dare, even in thought, thus  to accuse our Father of injustice and  partiality, and attribute to Him care- lessness in the fulfillment of His own  words?  Assuredly no one claiming to belong  to His people would be guilty of such  a thing.  Then must those who are unworthy  cease to expect a blessing from their attendance at the Temple while sin unrepented of still casts its odor about  them, and while bitterness or even an unforgiving coolness exists in their hearts against their brethren and sis- ters.  On this latter subject we feel that  much might be said. In the striving  after compliance with the apparently  weightier matters of the law, there is a possibility that the importance of  this spirit of love and kindness and  charity may be underestimated. For ourselves, we cannot think of any  precept that at present requires more  earnest inculcation.  During the past eighteen months there has been a division of the  Latter-day Saints upon national party  lines. Political campaigns have been  conducted, elections have been held,  and feelings, more or less intense,  have been engendered in the minds  of brethren and sisters upon one side and the other.  We have been cognizant of conduct ENDENTRY Bountiful Davis Co Utah Nov 30th 1896  Pres Wilford Woodruff Dear Sir I received your letter of the 30th and will Say I will except your call to go on a mission to the Southern States and will do the best I can if all is well I can get ready by the 14th of January  From your Brother in the Gospel Amos Cook Jr  David Stoker Bp ENDENTRY John D.

In answer to your esteemed of Jan 31th, will say, That the idea of a foreign mission to Norway, was received with satisfaction. I feel like it would be a source of happiness to go an tell my people that I was not decived when I embraced what is called Mormonism as I have tasted some of the sweets which follow obedience to the gospil of Christ.  Since the arrival of your latter, I have been trying to dispose of property so that I could pay my debts, and get mony to go with, but as yet without success. What I have to sell is mainly Ephraim City property and as we know that such has suffered more by the depressions in value then farming land. I stand a poor chance at present. In counciling with my Bishop and one of his councelors, ENDENTRY Alma Wright April 20 1896 ENDENTRY years’ sojourn with him, were not fully qualified to  preach the gospel—they had not been endowed with  power from on high. In testimony of this, turn to  the ##Acts 2:1-4|2nd chapter## of Acts, which reads thus: “And  when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one accord in one place: and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sit- ting: and there appeared unto them cloven tongues  like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them: and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began  to speak with other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance.” These things caused the people to mar- vel; some said they were drunk, but Peter, standing up with the eleven, said, “Ye men of Judea, and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and hearken to my words—these are not drunken, as  ye suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the day;  but this is that which was spoken by the Prophet Joel: And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh, and  your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams: and on my servants, and on my handmaidens, I will pour out in those days of my Spirit, and they shall prophesy.” ##Acts 2:14-18## Now, we observe,  that the apostles, after having received the Holy Ghost, were clothed with power, and began to preach  unto the people Jesus crucified; and they being  pricked to the heart, cried out, “Men and brethren,  what shall we do?  Then Peter said unto them, re- pent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of sins, and ye shall  receive the gift of the Holy Ghost: for the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are  afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call.  And with many other words did he testify and ex- hort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward generation. Then they that gladly received his word were baptized, and the same day were added unto  them three thousand souls.” ##Acts 2:37-41## ENDENTRY Alonzo G. Sedgwick Dec. 18 1896 ENDENTRY Amos Cook Jr Nov. 30 1896. ENDENTRY and have heard of many expressions that have been very painful to us and have grieved our spirits.  We know they have been an offense unto the God of peace and love, and a stumbling-block unto many of the Saints.  We feel now that a time for recon- ciliation has come; that before  entering into the Temple to pre- sent ourselves before the Lord in  solemn assembly, we shall divest our- selves of every harsh and unkind feel- ing against each other; that not only  our bickerings shall cease, but that the cause of them shall be removed, and every sentiment that prompted and has maintained them shall be dispelled; that we shall confess our sins one to another, and ask forgiveness one of another; that we shall plead with the Lord for the spirit of repentance, and, having obtained it, follow its prompt- ings; so that in humbling ourselves before Him and seeking forgiveness from each other, we shall yield that charity and generosity to those who crave our forgiveness that we ask for and expect from Heaven.  Thus may we come up into the holy place with our hearts free from guile and our souls prepared for the edification that is promised! Thus shall our supplications, undisturbed by a thought of discord, unitedly mount into the ears of Jehovah and draw down the choice blessings of the God of Heaven!  As your brethren, sustained by your vote and in your faith as the First Presidency of the Church, we have this to say to the Latter-day Saints, in our individual as well as our official capacity: If there is a single member of the Church who has feelings against us, we do not wish to cross the threshold of the Temple until we have satisfied him and removed from him all cause of feeling, either by explana- tion or by making proper amends and atonement; neither would we wish to enter the sacred portals of that edifice until we have sought an explanation, or amends, or atonement from any against whom we may have either a real or fancied grievance.  In now announcing this course for ourselves, we say to all the other offi- cers of the Church that we desire them to follow our example. We wish them from the highest to lowest and throughout all the Stakes and Wards of Zion to take heed of this counsel. Let them invite all who may have feelings against them to come forward and make them known; let them then en- deavor to correct any misapprehen- sions or misunderstandings which may exist, or give redress for any wrong or injury that may have been done.  We say the same—and when the offi- cers have taken the course indicated we wish them to say the same—to the individual members of the Church.  We call upon them to seek to have the fellowship of their brethren and their sisters, and their entire confidence and love; above all to seek to have the fellowship of their brethren and their sisters, and their entire confidence and love; above all to seek to have the fellowship and union of the Holy Ghost. Let this spirit be sought and cherished as diligently within the the smallest and humblest fam- ily circle as within the membership of the highest organiza- tion and quorum. Let it permeate the hearts of the brothers and sisters, the parents and children of the household, as well as the hearts of the First Presi- dency and Twelve. Let it mellow and soften all differences between members of the Stake Presidencies and the High Councils, as well as between neighbors living in the same ward.  Let it unite young and old, male and female, flock and shepherd, people and Priesthood in the bonds of gratitude and forgiveness and love, so that Israel may feel approved of the Lord, and that we may all come before Him with a conscience void of offense before all men. Then there will be no disappointment as to the blessings promised those who sin- cerely worship Him. The sweet whisperings of the Holy Spirit will be given to them and the treasures of Heaven, the communion of angels, will be added from time to time, for His promise has gone forth and it cannot fail!  Asking God’s blessing upon you all in your endeavor to carry out this counsel, and desirous of seeing it take the form of a united effort on the part of the whole people, we sug- gest that Saturday, March 25th, 1893, be set apart as a day of fasting and prayer. On that occasion we advise that the Presidencies of Stakes, the High Councils, the Bishops and their Counselors, meet together with the Saints in their several meeting houses, confess their sins one to another, and draw out from the people all feelings of anger, of distrust, or of unfriendli- ness that may have found a lodgment; so that entire confidence may then and there be restored and love from this time prevail through all the con- gregations of the Saints.

Sep 9, 1896  President Wilford Woodruff:  Dear Sir: I received your letter of the 4th stateing my name had been accepted as a Missionary to the Northern States and inquireing as to my feelings consearning the same and I acan say that though the call was unexpected and found me unprepared still I am willing to go and perform the same to the best of my ability and have made my arrangements to start upon the date mentioned: Yours respectfully,  Andrew Peterson.  Robert Davidson Bp ENDENTRY By this we plainly see, that the promise of the Holy  Ghost was not confined to the apostles, neither to that nor  any other particular age of the world; for Peter dis- tinctly and positively said to you and to your children—to them that are afar off—even as many as the Lord our God shall call. ##Acts 2:39## Now, if this promise of the Holy Ghost was to continue, then, certainly, faith, repentance, baptism,  must continue also: as the Holy Ghost was granted as  the seal of their obedience unto these ordinances. If  one of these principles be not essential, you may lay  aside the whole, since all are equally the commandments  of God. In proof of this, the Saviour, in the last chapter of Matthew, says, “Go ye, therefore, and teach all na- tions, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of  the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: teaching them to ob- serve all things, whatsoever I have commanded you. And lo! I am with you alway, even unto the end of the  world. Amen.” ##Matthew 28:19-20## Now, every person possessing common sense, must allow, that when the Saviour said all things he did not mean apart. The question is frequently  asked, on hearing a quotation from the word of God, “What does it mean?” We wish to be distinctly un- derstood, that when the Lord speaks, or reveals his word unto the children of men, he means just what he  says. The manner in which the word of God has been  spiritualised, and the diverse interpretations which have  been given by commentators and teachers of the people, in this day and generation of the world, is one great cause of the apostasy of the churches of the present day  from the ancient Apostolic Religion. There has evi- dently been a departure from the faith once delivered to the Saints. Of this the many different systems is a sufficient proof, as the Scriptures teach us that there is  one Lord, one faith, one baptism, and one body, as set forth by Gal. i.##, the apostle also  says, “Though we, or an angel from heaven, preach  any other Gospel unto you than that which we have  preached unto you, let him be accursed.”  What was  the Gospel which Paul preached? Why, that which  was taught by Jesus Christ, Peter, and the rest of his apostles—baptism for the remission of sins, andc.  We now refer you to John, the forerunner of Christ,  who preached faith in the Son of God, and baptism for  the remission of sins.

Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to John, to be baptized of him; but John forbade him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee,  and comest thou to me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Suffer it to be so now, to fulfil all righteousness: then he suffered him; and Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water, and lo! the heavens were opened upon him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him:  and lo! a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.” ##Matthew 3:13-17## If it were necessary that the Saviour, who was a holy Being, should be bap- tized, in order to fulfil all righteousness, and to obtain the approbation of his Father—how much more neces- sary it is that we, being unholy, should be baptized for the remission of our sins, that we may lay claim to the  promises of God. We find, in ##John 3:2-5|John, iii.##, that “Nico- demus came to Jesus by night, to inquire concerning these things; and Jesus answered and said unto him,  Verily, verily I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. Nicodemus inquired, how can these things be? Jesus answered,  Verily, verily I say unto thee, Except a man be born of  water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of  God.” Thus we see that these same principles were taught by our Lord Jesus Christ. Many persons be- lieve that the Saviour intended this in a spiritual sense: whereas, Jesus distinctly said, of the water and of the  Spirit.  Now, we can no where, in the teachings and sayings of the Saviour, find anything that can justify the custom of sprinkling, because the Redeemer said, “Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.” Now, we know that the word  birth, as it is here signified, is a transition from one ele- ment to another; and this could not possibly take place unless a man go down into the water, and become buried in it. Paul, in writing to the Romans, says,  “Know ye not, that as many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ, were baptized into his death?  Therefore, we are buried with him by baptism into death, that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we should walk in the newness of life: for if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the like- ness of his resurrection. ##Romans 6:3-5## For as many of you as have ENDENTRY Randolph Feb 3 1896  President Wilford Woodruff  Dear Brother  My Son Malcolm was recently called to take a mission to the Southern States and is appointed to leave about the first of June, his contract with the School Trustees as Teacher expires then hisMother's Folks and Myself are anxious to get geneologies from Scotland our Native country I now write to ask you whither his appointment could be changed to Great Britain without int- erfering with arraingements that are already made, but he desires me to say that he desires to Labor only where the Lord through his servants consider his labors most needed. your Brother in the Gospel  Archd McKinnon ENDENTRY Anton Peterson Mar 1 1896  I can.

Now, unless we are buried in the water like unto Jesus Christ, we cannot be said to be buried with him by bap- tism. Neither can we expect to receive the approbation of the Father, by setting aside the ordinance of his Son, and substituting one in its stead, which has been made by man—which sprinkling evidently has, since it is no- where to be found in the New Testament. We con- sider that baptism, by immersion, is equally necessary for our salvation, as faith, repentance, and the gift of  the Holy Ghost. We also consider, that all the com- mandments of God are equally essential to be observed,  as Jesus said, “He that believeth and is baptized, shall  be saved: he that believeth not, shall be damned.” ##Mark 16:16## These are the Saviour’s words; we have neither added nor taken from them. We will farther refer you to  ##Acts 10|Acts, x.,## which speaks of Cornelius, a devout man, and  one that feared God with all his house—which gave much alms to the people and prayed to God alway.   Notwithstanding all this, Cornelius was commanded by an angel to send for Peter, to tell him what he ought to do. When Peter came, he preached unto him Jesus.   While he yet spake, the Holy Ghost fell upon all of  them which heard the word, for they heard them speak  with tongues and magnify God. Then answered Peter, Can any man forbid water that these should not be bap- tized, which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we? And he commanded them to be baptized, in the  name of the Lord. This evidently proves that baptism is essential, notwithstanding that the Holy Ghost had been already poured out; if not, then the heavenly messenger had been sent in vain. This is the only in- stance on record wherein we read of the Holy Ghost  being poured out previous to baptism.  We will farther refer you to the ##Acts 9|9th chapter## of Acts, and bring before you in testimony, the circumstances of  Damascus, whither he was directed, that he might be informed of all things which were appointed for him to do, by one  Ananias, a servant of God. Ananias said unto him, “Why tarriest thou? arise and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.” ##Acts 22:16## We might give various other testimonies; for instance,  Eunuch, who stopped the chariot at the first water, that he might obey the ordinance of bap- tism (although he had, but a few moments previous to  ENDENTRY 135 E.

Both of these persons went down into the water, and came up straight- way out of the water. The Eunuch went on his way  rejoicing. ##Acts 8:26-39## We might also mention the jailor and his household, and many others.  We have given sufficient proof that baptism, by im- mersion, is one of the ordinances of the Gospel, and that it was instituted by Jesus Christ.  Now, we desire to show, that according to the order of the Gospel, the Holy Ghost is to be conferred by the laying on of hands. This ordinance ought also to be administered by those who have authority from God,  otherwise it is illegal. It should also be administered  only to those persons who believe, repent, and are bap- tized for the remission of sins. See ##Acts 8:12|Acts, viii. 12,## “But  when they believed Philip preaching the things con- cerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus  Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.” Again, ##Acts 8:14-17|verses 14 to 17##—“Now when the apostles, which were at Samaria had received the  word of God, they sent unto them John, who,  when they were come down, prayed for them, that they  might receive the Holy Ghost: for as yet he was fallen upon none of them; only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. Then laid they their hands  on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.” Here it is evident that they received the Holy Ghost by the lay- ing on of hands, for Simon, seeing that this was the  case, offered them money, that he might receive that  power: but he was rebuked for his wickedness, in sup- posing that the Holy Ghost could be purchased with  money.  For farther testimony, let us refer to ##Acts 19:4|Acts, xix. 4##— “Then said John verily baptized with the bap- tism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they  should believe on him which should come after him— that is, on Jesus Christ. And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came on them, and they spake with tongues and prophesied.” See, also, ##Hebrews 6:2|Hebrews, vi. 2##—“Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of  laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.” Now, you discover in this pas- sage, that baptism is mentioned in the plural, which  signifies, the baptism of water, and of the Holy Ghost;  which was conferred by the laying on of hands—and  that it is in accordance with the order of the ancient  Apostolic Church.

Let us turn to Cor. xii.—  The Apostle Paul tells us that no man can say that  Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost. Now, there  are diversities of gifts, or blessings—namely, wisdom,  knowledge, faith, healing, miracles, prophecy, discern- ing of spirits, diverse kind of tongues, interpretation of tongues, dreams, visions, andc., andc.; which were all  manifested in the Body or Church of Christ; in which  were set, apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors,  teachers, andc., which were given for the perfecting of the Saints, and the work of the ministry, for the edi- fying of the Body of Christ, till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature  of the fulness of Christ.—Eph. iv.  Having presented before the public, in these pages,  the Gospel of Jesus Christ, as it was anciently taught by Christ and his apostles, which consisted of faith, re- pentance, baptism for the remission of sins, the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands, and the gifts, graces, and blessings, which were for the work of the ministry, and the edifying of the body of Christ; and which were to continue until that which is perfect should  come; we also wish to say, that as God is an un- changeable Being, we firmly believe that the same Gos- pel and plan of salvation, Holy Ghost, gifts, and graces,  are equally necessary for the salvation of men, the edi- fying of the body, and the work of the ministry, in this generation, as they were eighteen hundred years ago; as the Gospel was committed to the Gentiles for the  express purpose of preparing them for the second com- ing of Christ—which coming is nigh at hand; this is  evident, from the signs of the times.  That the people in this city may be without excuse in the great and coming day of the Lord; and in order  that our garments may be clear of their blood, we feel  unwilling to close our subject until we bear testimony,  by laying before them, that the Lord has set his hand  again the second time to recover the remnant of his  people, which are of the house of Israel, and with them the fulness of the Gentiles.

We are well aware that many persons feel disposed to condemn us, and to calumniate our characters, by styling us false prophets, and  false teachers, without even taking the trouble to inquire into the  truth of our mission, or concerning the doctrines which we preach;  we would, therefore, call upon all those who are sincere searchers  after truth, to act according to the apostle’s advice—“Prove all things —hold fast that which is good.” Solomon says, “He that judgeth a  matter before he heareth it, is not wise.” And the Saviour says,  “With what judgment we judge, we shall also be judged—and with  what measure we mete, it shall be measured to us again.”  Any person desiring farther information respecting our doctrines, may obtain our publications at 40, Ironmonger Row, St. Luke’s,  London.

In that golden chain of valleys that lies across the breast of Utah, there is no brighter link than Cash No other county within the Territory can show such verdant hills, such sparkling streams, such fertile soil. To describe its won- derful and picturesque suroundings requires time and space not at the disposal of the writer. Suffice it to say that a fairer spot, more varied scenery or finer climate exists not on the face of the earth. The Valley is an oblong basin, of which the Wasatch mountains form the rim. It is 15 miles in width, and 60 miles in length, 4200 feet above the level of the sea, can cultivate a hundred thousand inhabitants, Logan, the county seat, being the largest, with over six thousand. Cache County is first above all other western places; the climate is all that can be desired, short, mild winters and the balance of the year such as cannot be excelled. Cache County has at present but one railroad, the Union Pacific. The Agricultural  College, capable of accommodating 1000 students, is a creditable institution and worthy patronage. All lines of business are represented here, such  in the west, "the best show and plow factories, nurseries, etc., all doing a safe and profitable trade.

J. F. S. ENDENTRY Joseph Johnson Dec. 31 1895 ENDENTRY  W. WOODRUFF'S ADDRESS,  TO THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS.  I deem it to be a duty which I owe to God and his church, to express my feelings  and bear my testimony unto you, concerning certain things that are presented to you for your consideration; especially, the claims of elder Sidney Rigdon to the exclusive right to lead and govern the church of Latter-day Saints. I have care- fully examined the trial which elder Rigdon has had before the authorities of the  church in Nauvoo, as given in the Times and Seasons, Vol. v. No. 17, and I am  satisfied that a righteous decision has been given in his case. I do not make these  remarks without my reasons, and I will hereby give those reasons.  I will commence by asking where has elder Rigdon been since he made his  flaming speech in Far West, which had a tendency to bring persecution upon the  whole church, especially the head of it? Has he stood by the side of the prophet  and patriarch as a true friend, to assist in carrying them through their trials, tribu- lations, and persecutions? Has he walked up into his place as a man of God, and  stood beside the prophet as his counsellor? Has he in any way, been a pillar or support to the church, from that day until this? Has he sustained the cause, and  used an influence to spread the work abroad since the persecution in Far West?  Has he in any way sustained the priesthood with dignity and honour, for the last  five years of his life? Or, has the prophet, in any point of view, leaned upon him as a counsellor, a staff, or support, for the last five years? Or has the prophet Joseph found elder Rigdon in his councils, when he organized the quorum of the  Twelve a few months before his death, to prepare them for the endowment? And when they received their endowment, and actually received the keys of the kingdom  of God, and oracles of God, keys of revelation, and the pattern of heavenly things;  and thus addressing the Twelve, exclaimed, “upon your shoulders the kingdom  rests, and you must round up your shoulders and bear it, for I have had to do it  until now. But now the responsibility rests upon you. It mattereth not what  becomes of me.” I say, has this been the case with elder Rigdon, in any wise. No, no, verily no; but the reverse, until he had become like a millstone upon the  back of Joseph Smith, the prophet, seer, and revelator. And I hereby bear my  testimony, that I heard the said Joseph Smith declare, that elder Rigdon had be- come like a millstone upon his back—a dead weight—and he had carried him long  enough, and must throw him off; and in my hearing requested one of the quorum  of the Twelve to bring him up before the Church, that he might be dealt with according to the law of the Church, that he might be cut off as a dead branch, and  no longer encumber the tree, as there was sufficient testimony against him. But  through the pleadings of brother Hyrum Smith and others, he has been spared.  Elder Brigham Young has been his friend—spoke in his favour, in consequence of  his age and former standing, hoping that he might reform, get the spirit of the  work, and magnify his calling. Upon this principle he has been sustained long,  until the branch became twice dead, and necessary to be severed from the tree.  Elder Rigdon, for the last five years of his life, has mostly been shut up in the  post-office; confined himself mostly to his own temporal affairs, manifesting but  little interest in the affairs of the church; and when any alarm or report was in  circulation unfavourable to the cause, if we could judge at all from the course he ENDENTRY worke fore them in  the temple  Your brother in  the gosple  Joseph Larsen D. B. Brinton Bp  upside-down text Jos. Larson July 11 1895 end of upside-down text ENDENTRY pursued, it had a tendency to increase trouble and disturbance, instead of decreasing  it. It is true, that elder Rigdon attended some of the councils that president  Smith held with the Twelve and others, before his death, while giving them instruc- tions; but I heard president Smith say, that he came in without his wish or invi- tation, as he had no confidence in him. Elder Rigden and his friends would now  claim, before the church and the world, that he holds the keys of the kingdom of God of the last dispensation, above the Twelve, the church, andc. I am ready to  admit before the whole church and the world, that he does hold one key be- yond the Twelve; one that they do not hold—one that God never held, nor Jesus  Christ, nor any true prophet, patriarch, or apostle; Joseph and Hyrum Smith were utter strangers to it. And if we can judge from his own mouth, according to the testimony given on his trial, we would suppose that Lucifer, who made war in heaven, was its author; and that it had been handed down unto the present day, and with it elder Rigdon has unlocked his heart, and pour- trayed before our eyes what was in it. What is it? Hear it, all ye Latter-day  Saints! Listen, O Earth, and judge the fruits of this Key. He threatens to turn traitor, publish against the church in public journals, intimating that he would bring a mob upon the church, stir up the world against the saints, and bring dis- tress upon them, andc. Times and Seasons, vol. v. p. 650—653. This ought to be  a sufficient reason for any true hearted Latter-day Saint to turn away from him with disgust, and treat all such men and principles according to their desert, which is, to let them entirely alone; for a more despicable principle never ex- isted in heaven, earth, or hell, than to prove a traitor to our God, our cause, and  our friends, and bring distress upon the innocent, and that too by turning against  the very cause that a man has spent a portion of his life to build up, and declared,  while in the faith, that it was true and righteous; for in all such cases there is  entirely a misrepresentation of truth and facts, in order to accomplish the intended evil, while a true statement of facts would advance the cause. This same prin- ciple was manifest in the case of Lucifer, Judas, Arnold, and many apostates in  this church, who, when they could not get their own ends answered, would  threaten to bring mobs upon the church, and in some instances have done so. I  would ask has Joseph or Hyrum Smith ever held such a key as this, or manifested  such a spirit as this? No, never; they have despised it in their hearts. President  Smith seemed to be sensible that such fruit was growing in the breast of elder  Rigdon; and if he had accomplished what duty appeared to present to his mind  upon that subject, that branch would have been severed from the tree before his  death; but through mercy it was spared until it has produced fruit which is evil in  its tendency, and dangerous to the welfare of the Church and Kingdom of God.  I would again ask, has elder Brigham Young ever manifested any knowledge of  the key above spoken of, or any spirit or disposition to turn against the church in any time of trial or persecution from its commencement? Has he ever deserted  Joseph, Hyrum, his brethren, or the cause, in one instance, since the foundation of  this church? No, never, in one instance. He has always been ready to go and come at the bidding of the Lord. He has not said so; but he has always said come. He has set the example and led the way, until he has traversed sea and  land, at home and abroad, native and foreign countries, until he has borne off the  keys of the kingdom of God in connexion with the Twelve, with honour and dig- nity, since they were committed to his charge. He has followed President Smith’s  footsteps closely for the last twelve years of his life, and especially the last five  years; while elder Rigdon has, at the same time, been confined to the Post-office,  apparently manifesting no interest in the welfare of the church and building up of  the cause. The spirit of wisdom and counsel has manifested itself in the course and deliberations of elder Young. He has not only had much experience with  president Smith, but he has proved himself true and faithful in all things commit- ted to his charge, until he was called to hold the keys of the kingdom of God in all  the world, in connexion with the Twelve, was the first to receive his endowment,  from the hands of the prophet and patriarch, who have leaned upon him in con- nexion with the Twelve, for years, to bear off this kingdom in all the world. And  they have done it with honour, labouring both day and night, making every sacrifice ENDENTRY required of them; leaving their homes, families and country, to establish the work  of God, and lay the foundation for the deliverance and redemption of Israel. And I can say with every sentiment of my heart, and feelings of my soul, as has president  Joseph and  the temple, and are willing to do right in all things, let me be one of that number.”  If it cost me my life to defend the truth of the everlasting gospel of the Son of God,  and to build upon the great and mighty foundation which God has laid in this last dispensation and fulness of times, through the instrumentality of his servant Joseph,  the prophet, seer, and revelator, for the pruning of the vineyard once more for the  last time, for the warning of the Gentiles, for the salvation of the honest in heart,  and meek of the earth, the building up of Zion, the establishment of Jerusalem, the  final deliverance of Israel, and to prepare the Saints for the hour of judgment which is to come, and to secure unto the righteous an exaltation of glory beyond the veil; I say, if it cost me my life, let it go; I want to be among the number; I am ready  to follow the example of those who have gone before me—when my work is done, I am ready to be offered, if necessary.  I had rather see ten men seal a righteous testimony with their blood, than to see one  man turn traitor, shed innocent blood and damn his own soul—for the object in living and  labouring in the cause of God is to secure a part in the first resurrection, eternal life,  and immortal glory. A religion that is not worth maintaining at the expense of life is not  worth having, “for he that will seek to save his life shall lose it, and he that will lay down his life for my sake, the same shall find it.” “And again, I will prove you, whether you will abide in my covenant, even unto death, saith the Lord.” Many of the patriarchs,  prophets, Jesus, the apostles, Hyrum, and many others, have sealed  their testimony with their blood.  Shall we then, as elders of Israel, or Latter-day Saints, back out, fear and tremble, or give  up the work, because elder Rigdon threatens to turn traitor or bring mobs upon us, because he cannot make the church bow to his notion of things? No, God forbid. It shows very  clearly that he has not the spirit of Christ, for the Lord nor one of his followers ever did  such a thing; and it is sufficient to open the mind of every saint to see where he stands. As far as my faith, prayers, influence, and labor, will effect anything, they will go to sus- tain president Young, and in connexion with him the quorum of the Twelve, in holding the keys of the kingdom of God, as they have been delivered unto them by the revelation  of Jesus Christ, and in the endowments they have received under the hands of the prophet  Joseph, and also all the quorums of the church as they have been set in order in the church and kingdom of God in these last days, through the voice of the prophet, seer, and  revelator, who has been raised up and laid the foundation, and sealed his testimony with  his blood.  And I wish to say to all the elders of Israel and saints of God, that the time has come,  when we need a double portion of the spirit of Joseph’s God to rest upon us, we should  gird up the loins of our minds. Watch and be sober, maintain the priesthood with dignity,  have the cause of God fully at heart, labor faithfully for its promotion while the day lasts,  for night will soon come when no man can work. We should practice virtue and holiness  before the Lord, and shun the very appearance of evil. We should enter our closets, and call upon God for wisdom to direct us in every duty in life. Our object should be to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ to this generation, and present those principles that will  save the souls of men.  If there is any man in this church that does wrong, that breaks the law of God, it mat- tereth not what his standing may be, whether among the Twelve, the High Priests, Seven- ties, or Elders, or in any other standing, there is a tribunal that will reach their case in  process of time, there is authority before whom they can be tried. Therefore let no one  turn against the cause of God, and stop in the road to destruction, on the plea that some- body has done wrong: it is no excuse for you or I to do wrong because another does:  the soul that sins, alone must bear it. Should I step aside from the path of duty it would  not destroy the gospel of Jesus Christ, or even one principle of eternal truth, they would  remain the same. Neither would it be any excuse for you to commit sin! but I should  have to bear my own sins, and not the sins of others—so with all men.  Therefore, let me exhort all ye elders of Israel and saints of God to rise up in the ma- jesty and dignity of your calling, make full proof of your ministry and covenant. Sustain by your works the authorities, keys, and priesthood, of God in all its bearings and appen- dages, through this last dispensation, for the eyes of God, angels and men, are over you,  and when the work is finished, you will receive your just recompence of reward.
