 Nov 24, 1889.Revelation given to Wilford Woodruff, Sunday Nov 24, 1889.Thus Saith the Lord, to my servant Wilford, I the Lord have heard thyprayers and thy request, and will answer thee by the voice of my spirit. Thus Saith the Lord, unto my servants the Presidency of my church,who hold the Keys of the Kingdom of God on this earth, I the Lordhold the destiny of the courts in your midst, and the destiny of thisnation, and all other nations of the earth in mine own hands, and allthat I have revealed, and promised and decreed concerning the generationin which you live, shall come to pass, and no power shall stay my hand. Let not my servants who are called to the Presidency of my church, denymy word or my law, which concerns the salvation of the children of men. Let them pray for the Holy Spirit, which shall be given them to guide them in their acts. Place not yourselves in jeopardy to your enemies by promise, your enemies seek your distruction and the distructionsof my people. If the Saints will hearken unto my voice, and the counselof my servants, the wicked shall not prevail. Let my servants, who officiate as your counselors before the courts, make their pleadings asthey are moved upon by the Holy spirit, without any further pledgesfrom the Priesthood. I the Lord will hold the courts, with the officers ofgovernment, and the nation responsible for their acts towards theinhabitants of Zion. I, Jesus Christ, the Savior of the world, am in your midst. I am your advocate with the Father. Fear notlittle flock, it is your father's good pleasure to give you the Kingdom. Fear not the wicked and ungodly. Search the scriptures, for theyare they which testify of me, also those revelations which I havegiven to my servant Joseph, and to all my servants since the world began,which are recorded in the records of divine truths. Those revelationscontain the judgments of God, which are to be poured out upon all nations under the heavens, which include Great Babylon. These judg-ments are at the door, they will be fulfilled as God lives. Leavejudgment with me, it is mine saith the Lord. Watch the signs of the times, and they will show the fulfillment ofthe words of the Lord. Let my servants call upon the Lordin mighty prayer; retain the Holy Ghost as your constant com-panion, and act as you are moved upon by that spirit, andall will be well with you. The wicked are fast ripening ininiquity, and they will be cut off by the judgments of God. Great events await you and this generation, and arenigh at your doors. Awake, O, Israel, and have faith inGod, and His promises, and he will not forsake you. I the Lordwill deliver my Saints from the dominion of the wicked, in mine owndue time and way. I cannot deny my word, neither in blessing norjudgments. Therefore let mine Anointed gird up their loins, watch and be sober, and keep my commandments. Prayalways and faint not; exercise faith in the Lord and in the promises of God; be valient in the testimony of JesusChrist. The eyes of the Lord and the Heavenly Hosts are watchingover you and your acts. Therefore be faithful until I come. I come quickly to reward every man according to the deeds done in thebody. Even so, amen.
