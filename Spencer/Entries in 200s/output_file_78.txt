The University of Utah.  DEPARTMENT OF  GEOLOGY AND MINERALOGY.  Salt Lake City.    June 18th, 1896.    President Wilford Woodruff.  Dear Brother,    Your letter of June 9th came duly to hand.  I accept the call to Switzerland and Germany and  can be ready to start on the date named in your letter: viz.,  Aug. 8th, 1896. I have saved up money in order to be able  to continue my studies in some of the eastern   or perhaps foreign universities and hence have some  means with which to pay expenses to my field of  labor.    Being a schoolteacher by profession whose specialty  is work in the lines of Geology and and and Mineralogy, and  a plumber by trade, I would appreciate the kindness  if it could be so arranged that I could, in connection  with my other duties, familiarize my self as much  as possible with the European school systems, schools,  especially the high schools and the universities, museums,  mines and places of geological interest, as well as become  acquainted with the European materials and methods  of work in the department of plumbing and sanitary  science. Trusting that the above reply will be satisfactory,    I am, dear sir,  very respectfully,    Wm. D. Neal.    (over)

I regret  very much the financial condition in  which I am placed makes it almost if not  quite imposible for me to go this Spring,   I having invested all the means I can  muster in an interprise that demands  my personal attention, for should I leave  at preasent my business would have to be run  byastranger and should any disaster befall  the busniess I would be financially ruined  I a not only this my elth as not been the best  being subgect to piles. I am in the meat packing  busness, I have no disposition whatever 
 ture to you but there are meny things to take  place that I cannot write in my opinion. I am  but a poor scritbe and my health is not good and  has not been since I suffered so much in trying  to escape the wrath of our enemies in the time  of our persecution traveling and working with wet  and cold feet for 6 weeks in the breaking up of winter  was finely settled here. since my heathh has been poor.  And now, I would ask if it is proper and you think  me worthy if you are willing to rermber me in your   crircle as you pray in the temple that I may gain  my helth for I should be glad to live a while yet  if the Lord and my brethren were willing for when  our bodies die they go down to silence and the spirit  of those who have ben baptised go to a place of rest where  I suppose there is no laber, and to be deprived of laber  it must seem like a prison to me, and I wish for  that reason to serve the Lord a little longer in the  flesh. I am only 78 y[ear]s old since the 28th day of August  I have have kept the word of wisdom since 1859,  and my blessing received from Patrarch John young  promises me to live to be gathered up to Zion the center

 Emery Stake Tithing Office.    STAKE PRESIDENCY:  C. G. LARSON, President,  ORANGE SEELY,  WM. HOWARD, Counselors,  A. E. WALL, Clerk.    Huntington, Emery County, Utah, March 14th, 1897    President Wilford Woodruff,   Salt Lake City,    Dear brother:    The Missionary Committee, of the   Apostles, wrote me Apr. 15, 1895, as to my willingness and   circumstances, to fill ^a^ mission to the Southern States.    This inquir'y I answered at once, explaining my  circumstances. The First Presidency then wrote April 24  statoing that no call would be made at that time, but,   that when I felt able and free to go, to report to President  Woodruff. This I would have done some time ago,   but on Oct. 12th 1896, ^another letter came^ releasing me, for the present, "from any   obligations to go on a mission, with the understanding" that   I teach the Church Seminary at Huntington for the  school year (1896-7) for such time as it might be kept in  session. Have complied with this provision, as the school  year, arranged by the Seminary Board, is nearly completed.    Will try to answer any call made of me, by you or  the Missionary Committee, any time after the fist of   May 1897.    Your brother in the Gospel,  Alonzo. E. Wall

 THE DESERET WEEKLY.    Truth and Liberty.    No. 7 SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH, FEBRUARY 3, 1894. Vol. XLVIII.    THE POWER OF FAITH.    Discourse Delivered at the Sixty-fourth  Semi-Annual Conference, of the  Church, in the Tabernacle, Salt Lake  City, Sunday Afternoon, October  8th, 1893, by    PREST. WILFORD WOODRUFF.    REPORTED BY ARTHUR WINTER    I have never attended a conference   since I have been a member of this   Church—now nearly sixty years—at   which I have refused, when called upon   by the proper authority and the Spirit   of God, to speak and to bear my testi-  mony according to the light that I had   in me, and I disliked to pass over this   conference without saying something.   I have been in poor condition for public   speaking, having had a severe cold upon   my lungs during the past week, which   has prevented me from doing almost   any kind of business.    I have been deeply interested in the   testimonies of the servants of God who   have addressed us during this confer-  ence. They have laid before us many   great truths. My mind rests upon the   subject of faith. Faith is the first prin-  ciple of the Gospel. What is faith?   Paul, in writing to the Hebrews, under-  takes to explain it He says that "faith   is the substance of things hoped for, the   evidence of things not seen;" and to   prove this he goes on to tell what dif-  ferent men accomplished through faith.  (See xi chap. of Hebrews). I look upon   faith as one of the most important prin-  ciples that God ever revealed to man.   Here we have four temples in these   mountains, and hundreds of people are   laboring in them. Who for? Both for   the living and the dead. Why do they   labor for the dead? Have they ever   seen the resurrection of the dead? No,   except by vision or revelation. But   they have faith in it, and as an evidence   of that faith they perform this work.   They look forward to the resurrection   and eternal judgment, to the celestial   kingdom and the great blessings which   God has revealed for the salvation and   exaltation of the children of men. They   do this by faith, and it is by this power   that they have accomplished what they   have during the last sixty years. By   faith this tabernacle has been built,   these temples have been reared, and   these people have been gathered from   the nations of the earth.  Thousands of   Elders have been called, not from col-  leges, but from the various occupations   of life, and sent forth into the world to   preach the Gospel without money and   without price. Now for many years   they have gone forth and preached this   Gospel. Men have listened to them,    and some spirit or power has convinced   them that the testimony which these   Elders have borne was true. These   humble men of God have gone forth   and said: "The fullness of the ever-  lasting Gospel has been revealed by the   administration of angels; the Lord has   raised up prophets and inspired men;   He has organized the Church on the   earth as it was in the days of Jesus   Christ and the Apostles; we have   brought you this Gospel; hearken to it,   and we promise you, in the name of the   Lord Jesus Christ, if you will receive   our testimony, repent of your sins, go   down into the water and be baptized   for the remission of your sins, you shall   receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, that   shall bear record and witness unto you   that what we say is true." What has   been the result of this? Thousands have   believed that testimony and proved that   it was true. These Elders labored by   faith; they traveled by faith; they worked   by faith. It was faith that sustained   them all the way through. They trav-  eled without purse and scrip, and through   their faith the God of heaven fed and   clothed them, and opened the way be-  fore them. This has been the case now   for sixty years. And many people be-  lieved the testimony of these simple   men. They repented of their sins, were   baptized for the remission of them, in   the name of the Father, and of the Son,   and of the Holy Ghost; they received   that Holy Ghost, and it bore testimony   to them of the truths of the Gospel.    Brethren and sisters, it is by faith that   you are here today, gathered from the   nations of the earth. By that power you   have been sustained, until you have ac-  complished these things that are now   before you in your history. We ought   to look at these things as they are. We   ought to have faith, not only in what is   past but in what is to come. It is by   faith that we look forward to the resur-  rection of the dead. Our forefathers are   in the spirit world. They died without   the Gospel. They never saw the face of   a prophet or an apostle. They laid   down their bodies, and their spirits went   into the spirit world. There they have l  istened to the Gospel of Christ. Jesus   taught the Gospel in the spirit world   while His body lay in the tomb. Joseph   Smith, Hyrum Smith and those Elders   of Israel who have been martyred and   who have died for the word of God and   testimony of Jesus have gone to preach   this Gospel there. Spirits in prison have   received their testimony. The prison   doors have been opened. These spirits   will come forth in the morning of the   resurrection, and they will receive these   blessings and glories, the same as if they   had heard and received the Gospel in   the flesh. And these Latter-day Saints   have built these temples and gone to    work in them with just as much assur-  ance of the truth of these things as   though it had been sounded in their ears   by the trump of the archangel of God.   They have had this faith, and they will   not be disappointed.    That is the condition the Latter-day   Saints are in today. As to opposition,   we may expect that, because the arch-  enemy has labored against the work of   God in all ages of the world. But we   have reason to rejoice and to be thank-  ful to our Heavenly Father that we are   as well as we are today before Him. I   want the Latter-day Saints to bear in   mind that the ancient patriarchs and   prophets spoke as they were moved   upon by the Holy Ghost, and they spoke   the truth. The Lord has said just what   He meant, and meant what He said.   The word of the Lord will never fall un-  fulfilled. If you want to know what is   coming to pass, read the revelations of   God in the Bible, in the Book of Mormon   and in the Book of Doctrine and Cove-  nants. The revelations of the Lord   through the Prophet Joseph Smith are   glorious revelations. What the Lord   promised in the commencement of this   work has been fulfilled to the very letter   up to the present. So it will continue.   We should lay these things to heart.    There has been a good deal said with   regard to our temporal affairs. That is   all right. What the brethren have said   concerning our temporal condition is of   importance to us. I still am of the   opinion that inasmuch as Zion is going   to be built up on the earth, it is the   mind and will of God that we should do   something for ourselves. We ought to   cultivate the earth. We ought not to   wait for the world to come and   plant and dig our potatoes, or   plant and harvest our wheat, or   to build railroads and carry them on.   The Presidency of the Church have   shouldered a very heavy load connected   with this sugar factory. Why should we   not make sugar? Utah sends a very   great amount every year out of the   Territory for sugar. This should not   be. The soil is here and the talent is   here to raise beets and to make sugar.   Why should not the Latter-day Saints   do this and keep their money at home?   Is there any sin in this? Not at all; the   more of these things we would do, the   better, I think, the Lord would be pleas-  ed with us. I know there has been   quite a feeling one way or another, be-  cause we have burdened ourselves with   these labors. But it is our duty to try   to get the Latter-day Saints to cultivate   the earth and to produce what they eat   and drink and what they wear. We have   tried to do this. It is true, it cost a great   deal to establish the sugar plant, and the   Church had to shoulder a great measure   of responsibility in connection with it,

 Junction Piute Co. Utah  July 22nd 1898    President Wilford Woodruff    Dear Brother    Your letter of July  15th was duly received and in reply  to same will say that I regret that  my present circumstances are such that  I feel that it would be unwise for me  to arrange to start on my mission to the   Southern States on the 18th of August next.  I have not been so successful financially  as I expected and therefore not quite pre-  pared to start so soon, but the main obsta-  cle seems to be a sore on my lip of a can-  cerous nature for which I have been receiving  treatment for some time and was in hopes that  it was cured, but found it was not.    I understand that another company of   missionaries are to start toward the last  of next September, and if possible I   should be pleased to make arrangements to  start at the time or a little late if  others should be going sometime this fall.    I should be glad to hear from you  again, and also to recive such instructions  as will be necessary to enable me to be pre-  pared so that I may know what amount  of means &c would be necessary to fromfit

 This Elder is called to Oregon but can easily be  changed to the Northern States if you think well  to do so. G. R.    Ephriam Mar. 12, 1898.    President Wilford Woodruff.    Dear Brother.    Your letter announcing  me as a missionary was  duly received. I thank  the Lord that I have been  worthy of being called as His  servant and trust that I   m[a]y prove myself worthy  to be His servant.    Although the field appointed  me was somewhat surprising  I am willing to go and  try to do the best that I   can. I had somewhat  cherished the hope of seeing  my relatives in Chicago  and laboring a short time  with them, who are at 
 in order to carry it out. I do not think   we have done wrong in that. When I   go before my Father in heaven I am   willing to bear my part of the respon-  sibility, because if there is anything on   earth that I was ever moved upon by the   Spirit to do it was to unite in that enter-  prise with my brethren. I believe it is   our duty to manufacture what we use,   as far as we can, at home. We refer to   these temporal things because they are   and always will be connected with us.    I feel to rejoice myself that we are as   well off as we are. There has never   been a period when we have been any   better off than we are today. I look   back to the days when we came here.   We found a barren desert. The man   that led us here was Brigham Young.   He was a prophet, seer and revelator.   He was never destitute of revelation   from the day that I first knew him until   his body was laid in the tomb. He was   a great man—a man of God. We see   the result of his work here. He was   our architect, so to speak. He fulfilled   his mission in a great and wonderful   manner, and when he laid his body   down he went to mingle with his breth-  ren and the Gods.    The Gospel of Christ is true. The   Zion of God is true. We are here in   fulfilment of the revelations and visions   of the ancient patriarchs and prophets.   Read Isaiah, Jeremiah and the other   prophets, and see what they said. We   came here by the revelations of God.   Many of the brethren felt it hard to   leave our beautiful Nauvoo and to go to   the mountains. Had we not done this,   some of the revelations of God would   have fallen unfulfilled. I say to the   Latter-day Saints, have faith. Let us   have faith in the promises and revela-  tions of God. Do you comprehend   what is manifest in the earth today? The   seeds of destruction are everywhere.   The judgments of God are beginning to   go forth. But who acknowledges the   hand of God in these things? I rejoice   that the cloud of darkness is being lifted   from the eyes of our countrymen in re-  gard to the Latter-day Saints, and that   they are manifesting kindness towards   us. Speaking of our visit East, I con-  fess it was marvelous in my eyes to see   how different these things are today to   what they have been in the past. They   begin to see that the people in the moun-  tains of Israel are white men, and that   they have some talent. I thank God   for these things. I thank Him for the   kindness we have received at the hands   of the friends of our nation. My prayer   to God is that His blessings may rest   upon our nation and upon the leaders   thereof, and that the spirit of liberty, of   law, of righteousness and of truth may   rest upon all American citizens and   everybody that dwells under this great   government. It is one of the greatest   governments God ever raised upon the   earth. What has it been raised up for?   That in the midst of it the Lord might   establish His Zion and His work.    Brethren and sisters, let us be true and   faithful to our duties and to our God.   Let us look forward to the exaltation   and the blessings that God has in store   for those who keep His commandments.   Every man will be judged according to   the deeds done in the body. There are   laws celestial, laws terrestrial, and laws   telestial. We speak of the celestial   glory and of the heavenly hosts. Who   are the heavenly hosts? They are those   who have tabernacled on this earth, been   faithful to God, and passed behind the   veil. And they are interested in the   welfare of the inhabitants of the earth.   They are interested in the salvation of   the human family. They have labored   for it in the flesh; they do so today in   the spirit world. These are the people   we look to by faith. We are here upon   a mission. We are trying to fulfill that   mission. I hope we may be true and   faithful to it.    I am thankful before the Lord for the   blessings that I have enjoyed in this con-  ference and for the testimonies I have   heard from these Apostles. They speak   as men having authority, inspired by the   Spirit of God, and they speak the truth.   Many of our friends that have labored   with us have passed away. We our-  selves shall pass away in our time. I   may say that if it had not been for the  prayers of these thousands of Latter-  day Saints, I today should have been   mingling with my brethren in the spirit   world. I know that I have been preser-  ved by the prayers of my brethren and   sisters, and I am still with you. I feel   very weak, and hardly qualified to mag-  nify my calling as an Apostle, as the   leader of the people of Israel; in fact, no   man is, only as moved upon by the   power of God. What little time I may   stay here I hope my heart will not be set   on the riches of this world, but on doing   the will of God and uniting with my   brethren in bearing off the great work   and responsibility resting upon us. If   we will do this, all will be right. When   we get to the other side of the veil, we   shall know something. We now work   by faith. We have the evidence of   things not seen. The resurrection, the   eternal judgment, the celestial kingdom,   and the great blessings that God has   given in the holy anointings and endow-  ment in the temples, are all for the   future, and they will be fulfilled, for   they are eternal truths. We will never   while in the flesh, with this veil over us,   fully comprehend that which lies before   us in the world to come. It will pay   any man to serve God and to keep His   commandments the few days he lives   upon the earth. With regard to our   position before we came here, I will say  that we dwelt with the Father and with   the Son, as expressed in the hymn, "O   my Father," that has been sung here.   That hymn is a revelation, though it was   given unto us by a woman—Sister Snow.   There are a great many sisters have the   spirit of revelation. There is no reason   why they should not be inspired as well   as men. We dwelt in the presence of   God before we came here, and we have   been sent here upon a mission, and I do   not want to live any longer myself than   I can magnify that calling. What bene-  fit is it to any man to dwell here and to   miss the object for which he was sent,   even eternal life? Therefore, it does   not pay any man to sin. When a man   sins it is because he yields to the enemy,   not because the devil has power over   him irrespective of his agency. The   devil is laboring for the destruction of   the human family. But the Gospel is   sent into the world to save them.    Brethren and sisters, God bless you.   I am glad to meet with you and to have   a little time to speak to you. I hope   and trust we may be true and faithful to t  he end of our days, that we may be   satisfied when we get through with our   work; that our hearts may not be set up-  on anything that perisheth, but that we  may do what we can to build up Zion    and bring forth salvation to mankind as   far as we have the opportunity while we   dwell in the flesh. God bless us and   guide us all i our work, for Jesus'   sake. Amen

 IN EXPLANATION.    Purpose—The purpose of the Press Clipping  Bureau is to supply people with those matters of  especial interest to them printed in the newspapers  of the country.    Ground Covered.—It reads papers from every  region of the United States and Canada, including  all the dailies of large cities, most of the dailies of  small cities, and thousands of weeklies. A cus-  tomer may limit his order to any group of States,  or any single State.    Delivery.—A daily service is given whenever it  is asked; otherwise its frequency depends on the  size of the order, but the clippings are delivered at  least once a week to all.    Payment.—The Bureau has two systems of pay-  ment, by the piece and by the month. The  method of payment does not affect the thorough-  ness of service.    The piece price is five cents  a clipping and prevails on all orders producing  less than 100 clippings a month, on orders of a  temporary nature, and on personal orders. No  order will be taken for less than 100 clippings,  and a minimum charge of ONE DOLLAR A MONTH  will be made for keeping any customer on our  books, whether clippings are found to that amount  or not.    Monthly rates are common in the  case of orders in business lines, making the cost  ordinarily much less than by the piece, though  a low piece price can be quoted on large standing  orders and is sometimes preferable.    Remittance.—Payment in advance is not re-  quired. Bills are rendered monthly, and we stipu-  late that remittance be made to us every month, no  matter what the size of the bill.    Credits.—In general, acceptance of clippings  binds the customer to pay for them. Credit for  matter not coming under the order cannot be given  after thirty days. In justice to us we should be 
 me out and take me to my field of  labor. My desire is to go as soon as possible  and fulfill the mission and believe the   way will be opened for me to do so.

I am pleased to say that the  call is agreeable to me and  I shall be present on the spec-  ified time to be set apart  for the labor, if my heavenly  Father will permit me the  privilege. I feel the call is a re-  sponsible one and unless the  Lord will help me I shall feel  incompetent to do the work.    Your brother in the Gospel    Andrew S. Larson.

 informed at once if we are sending classes of mat-  ter that are not wanted.    Duplicates.—It is not our intention to send any  customer repetitions of the same fact, or copies of  the same comment, unless they are specifically  requested, but some duplication is unavoidable.  Credit is given for duplicates returned at once or  at the end of each month.    Trivialities.—We decline to undertake that our  employees shall exercise any judgment on ques-  tions of triviality. We sell memory, not discrimi-  nation. Customers are asked to bear in mind  that though more or less of the clippings may be  trivial, a single clipping is often worth enough to   offset the cost of many that are worthless.    Restrictions.—The more an order is restricted,  the harder it is to remember its limits and the  greater the danger useful matter will be omitted.  Better pay a little more, and make sure to get all  you want. An order may extended or re-  stricted at any time.    Discontinuance.—One week's notice of discon-  tinuance is to be given. This condition is waived   in the case of orders given for a definite term, as  for one month; but if without demur the customer  recieves and retains clippings sent to him after the  expiration of that term, he is to be responsible  for payment therefor at the same rate, no matter  what previous conditions may have been imposed.   No order will be accepted without this proviso, meant  simply to protect us in case service is inadver-  tently continued and the customer fails to call our  attention to it.    Competetion.—We will content ourselves with  the simple statement that whenever our work is to  be put in comparison with that of any other clip-  ping bureau, we will make no charge for a week's  trial if ours is not then acknowledged the better.   We invite such comparisons.

 CLIPPINGS IN BUSINESS.    Clippings are of use to any business man seek-  ing business or doing business outside his own  neighborhood.    They give earliest information of all State,  county, city and town appropriations; keep sub-  scribers posted on the published projects of corpor-  ations, military and civic organizations, political  and athletic clubs, fraternal and religious societies;  and transmit information on a great variety of  other enterprises involving the expenditure of  money. In no other way can this information be  so thoroughly, accurately, and promptly obtained,  as it is here taken directly from the local press.  Some of it may sooner or later be found in the  trade papers, but the Bureau beats them always by  two days, and from that up to eight days, thereby  giving subscribers a decided advantage over rivals  who depend on the trade papers alone.    At the opportune time clippings furnish the  names and addresses of people in a position to  become buyers, such as tradesmen opening new  stores, extending, changing location, burned out;  men retiring from business and therefore with  money to invest or to spend, perhaps in travel;  men suffering from accidents, resulting, for in-  stance, in amputations, necessitating the purchase  of artificial limbs; women recently becoming moth-  ers, and likely to buy baby food or baby carriages;  women just married and therefore needing visiting  cards or cook books.    For general circularizing the addresses to be  obtained from newspapers have been little used,  presumably because it costs money to get them so,  but in the end it is at least a question if that is not  more economical than the use of lists which every  day makes more full of errors because of deaths,  removals, reverses of fortune, etc., and of the origi-  nal accuracy of which there was little guarantee.  Clippings furnish the addresses of society ladies in

In reply, will say that I will  be ready and on hand on the date mentioned, Oct. 20, 1897.    I am not as well prepared intellectually and financially  as I should like to be.

"We regard your Bureau as very valuable to all desiring quick and  correct information from a wide territory."—Woodbury, Moulton &   Stearns, Investment Bankers, Springfield.    "We take pleasure in saying that we are very much pleased with  your service, finding it very complete and prompt."—Bureau of  Information, General Electric Co., Boston and New York.    "We think your system of Press Clippings if thoroughly followed  up, is of value to those looking for new trade. In several instances  we were, by this means, brought into contact with parties who after-  wards became our customers."—Derby & Kilmer Desk Co., Boston.    "It gives us great pleasure to say that we find your Bureau a con-  stant source of valuable information, which it would be well-nigh  impossible to secure in any other way. At the risk of causing you to  increase the rates of service, we acknowledge that a single c[l]ipping  is sometimes more valuable to us than the entire cost of clippings for  a year."—Edwin Rogers & W. E. Decrow, N. E. Agents, Game-  well Fire Alarm Telegraph Co., Boston.    "We were one of the original subscribers to your Press Clipping  Bureau, and it gives me pleasure to state that the service has been  satisfac[t]ory in every respect. While perhaps a half of the squibs  which you send may be of indifferent value to us, we frequently  receive from you a clipping which alone is worth many times more  than we pay for it. Your service has not only been thorough, but  particularly prompt, it being nothing unusual for us to receive a clip-  ping from a distant paper within a few hours from the arrival of the  paper in Boston. We expect to be subscribers to your Bureau as  long as we two do last[.]"—Nath'l C. Fowler, Jr., Advertising  Dept., Pope Mfg. Co, Boston.

 IN CONSTRUCTION LINES.    Dealers in building supplies,  — in materials, in  fixtures, in furniture, — nowadays invariably make  use of some source of information about construc-  tion work. They may get it from contractors',  architects', building, or real estate journals; or  from type-written bulletins. In each of these cases  the great bulk of the news in reality comes from  local newspapers. We have for sale the source it-  self, that is, the newspaper item, which is prefer-  able for several reasons: First, re-publishing takes  time; the journals are printed either weekly or  monthly, and their news must be from three days  to a month behind ours; the daily bulletin is one  or two days behind us. Secondly, in all transcrip-  tion there is a percentage of error, and all conden-  sation is likely to omit useful details; the pretence  that news re-published in bulletins has been veri-  fied by correspondence with architects and owners,  is rarely backed up by the facts; clippings give all  the news to be had, and give it with the maximum  of accuracy. Thirdly, both journals and bulletins  ordinarily give but one mention of any structure;  by means of clippings, howeve[r, ] you can keep  posted continuously as to the progress of the work,  and in the case of all considerable edifices the  references in the local press are frequent. Fourth-  ly, the value of any business news decreases as the  number of users increases; the more competitors,  the less profit for each; journals and bulletins are  accessible to everybody; the use of clippings, by  the very nature of the business, is restricted. No  other building news medium whatever furnishes  anything like the quantity of news about building  in small places.    Clippings cost about the same as the type-writ-  ten bulletins; and much more than a single jour-  nal, but no more than the subscription price of all  the journals that would have to be taken to furnish  [h]alf the news obtainable through clippings, to say

 nothing of promptness, exhaustiveness, accuracy,  and the trouble of handling many trade papers.  In short, we believe that clippings furnish the most  and best building news at least cost.    We make no pretence that a clipping is more  than it shows on the face. If there are errors in it,  the fault is the newspaper's, not ours. We do not  guarantee to send everything; we send all our  readers can find. We send much useless matter,  but thereby we make sure that no useful matter  shall be lost through our own exercise of judg-  ment, which is not and cannot be so good as the  dealer's.    It need hardly be pointed out that here more  than anywhere else the earliest news is far the best  news. The salesman or catalogue or letter first  on the spot, stands much the best chance of getting  the order. We invite comparisons to show if the  bulk of our news is not the earliest to be had, and  will make no charge for a week's trial if it prove  otherwise.    Comments on Construction Clippings.

"We cannot see very much to be improved upon in the service  which you have been furnishing us." — Berlin Iron Bridge Co., East  Berlin, Conn.    "Your service is in every way satisfactory. Your clippings are fresh and we find the information uniformly reliable." — Sidney School Furniture Co., Sidney, O.    "The c[l]ippings you have sent us have been very satisfactory. Of  course quite a number are of no use, but taken altogether we like  your enterprise v[e]ry much." — S. C Nightingale & Childs, Manu-  facturers' Supplies, Boston .    "It gives us pleasure to say we have found the clippings from the  Bureau of great assistance to us in our business, and we are very  much pleased with the prompt and efficient service rendered us." —  Sprague Electric Railway & Motor Co., N. E. Agency.    "We have for several years been using your clippings to aid the  sale of our goods, (stable fixtures,) and that we have no idea of dis-  continuing the service, is the best proof we can give of our apprecia-  tion of it[.] We know of no equally quick, accurate, and thorough way  of getting building news from a large extent of territory. The  promptness and regularity with which your work is done, lead us to  the belief that business methods prevail in your office, and that yours  is the best service for business men." — W. A.

 FOR TRADE AND CLASS PAPERS.    Through practical experience in the editorial  and business management of two class papers, we  were led to realize the helpfulness of clippings to  class and trade journals, and were enabled to de-  velop our business in this line with results mutu-  ally beneficial to publishers and ourselves. For  some time we have been serving more than a hun-  dred of these publications, and believe we are safe  in saying that we serve more trade papers than all  the other Bureaus in the country put together.  Among them are most of the leading journals, such  as the Iron Age, Jeweler's Weekly, Boot and Shoe  Recorder, Engineering News, Electrical Review,  Street Railway Journal, American Banker, Brew-  er's Journal, Bicycling World, Hotel World, Har-  ness Gazette, Coal Trade Journal.    We act as exchange editors for these publica-  tions, so far as the reading and cutting go, sending  to each all the pertinent news and miscellany our  readers can find. Our shears do much toward fill-  ing their columns of news notes; supplying them  with fresh anecdotes, jokes, and special articles  relating to their respective interests; furnishing  topics for editorials.    In the business office the clippings are not of  least value, for they give a continual stream of  addresses to which to send sample copies and  letters soliciting subscriptions, as well as news of  concerns starting in business who may advertise.    Clippings supplement correspondence in  places where papers have representatives, ensuring  that in case of their sickness or negligence the  paper shall "get left" on no important happening.  They show whether the correspondent is covering  the ground thoroughly or not, and if he is relying  on the local papers for the bulk of his matter.  Well enough for all practical purposes we cover  hundreds of places, and even whole States, where  it would not pay any publication to maintain a cor-
