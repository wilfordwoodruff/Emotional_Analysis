The intelligence from the valley is quite cheering.  The discovery of a coal  an iron are of far more value to us than a gold mine would be. Since my arrival here I have been pretty busy among grave Senators, impulsive representatives of the people, and other functionaries. Business progresses very slowly in Congress, the organ- ization of the House is not yet completed, though more than six weeks of the session have already passed. Though there is scarcely a ray of hope of our admission into the Union as a State, the prospect of our obtaining a territorial ^organization^ is far from being discouraging, and an influential Senator has given me encouragement to hope that we may be authorized to elect our own officers. Some time ago I understood that Mr Kentucky had received a remonstrance to our memorial.  I suspect- ed its character and called to see him, he kindly favored me with a perusal of it. It charges us with a number of the foulest deeds and abominations in the dark catalogue of crimes, and is signed by William Smith and thirteen others.  Mr Stanton was very friendly, but deemed it his duty to present it in the House.  On the 31st Ult.

So long as my Husban money to give those dear brothers, and a home for then month after month it was all well enogh, but when he was reducted in his circumstances by fowllowing them west by the mob, and sickness and he had nothing more to give; then he must be cast off as not worth saveing.

The honorable Senator was somewhat excited, gave a synopsis of its contents, thought the charges aught to be investigated, and moved its reference to the Committee on Territories of which he is a member. The other remonstrance was also presented in the House the same day, an abstract of which appeared in the papers the following morning, and created consider- able sensation. The same evening I called at Judge Underwood's, but he was absent, however the next morn- ing I had an interview with ^him,^ and another two or three days afterward, explained matters to him, and got him pretty well satisfied.  I also called on the Chairman of the Committee on Territories in the House, and other members,and with the review of counteracting the effect it had produced and was producing I deemed it expedient to have the enclosed article published in the Republic, the government organ and afterward called on the editors of ^the^ Union, Globe and National Intelligencer, and requested them to republish it while they did, two of them with some prefatory remarks. Immediately after this I received, and I thanked God for it, Mr Kinkead's account, and other favorable intelligence from the valley, which I have had published in the four principal papers of this city.  I omitted to mention that Mr. Underwood at the time he presented ENDENTRY what he said just as soon with out the papers, as with them.  I would never hurt my Husbands feellings by leting him see the letter you sent if he has not allready seen you as he proposed to do, ^when he^ whent away, I epect he is on his return now in a vessel that malled from this port.  God: forgive me if I say any thing amiss, but when I think how my husband was respected before he came in to this Church, in the Baptist church to which he belonged he was beloved as a member, and looked up to as one of the pillars of the church and now he must be belied by a set of misecrents that is not worthy to carry his old shoes after him, and as long as I can speak I will not hear my husband so belied as I know he has been and hold my peace, this you may tell Orson Hide on any one else.  I know how my husband was treated in St Louis by the Presideing Elder and other would be  page torn ask Brother E T Benson he knows my husband better than any one else and prehaps will render a more just account.  I do not blame you for I well know by whose instignation it is that you speak as you do, and I hope I shall not say anything to hurt your feellings but you must be ware how you condem an inocent man who posesses more soul than as many of those (insignificant beings I could mention) as could stand between here and the salt lake.

I shall have it immediately republished in all the principal papers of the City.  I shall send you a copy of it.  I have addressed a note to the Honorable Senator to-day, requesting him to give it publicity at his earliest convenience.  I was presented to the President some time since, and stated to him the object of my visit to Washington, his reply was, "That lies in the breast of Congress." A report has recently been in circulation to a limited extent, that the President had said at a dinner party at the White House that he would veto any bill that may be passed for the benefit of the Mormons, and I have reason to beleive that it is not entirely without foundation in truth, but notwithstanding that there will be no difficulty in that quarter I beleiieve on what I regard as excellent authority.

Do not be surprised to learn that this Union may be shaken to its centre before the close of the present session. The South is determined that the "vexed question" of slavery shall be disposed of, and in their own way, and the North seem equally determin- ed not to yield an inch. One Southern ^Senator^ said to me not long since "ninety nine to one but the Union will be disolved" Another Southern Senator told me that  just before New Year that this question was now to be settled, and was to take precedence of all other business—The South have been caucusing, but they  have not been able to agree among themselves. They can- not all be brought to unite on Mr Calhoun or on any other man as their leader. In compliance with an ivitation I visited Col Benton, who was quite friendly, and said it was clear that we aught to have a territorial government. I have also had an inter- view with Mr Calhoun who is a very agreeable and affable man, and remarked that we should have the same chance as other territories. When our memorial and consti- tution were presented in the Senate, Gen. Cass came to me and said, "I shall go for a state, your folks can manage a state as well as anybody else". William Smith's memorial has prevented me from seeing Mr Webster which however I shall do very shortly. I have an excellent little trait by Brother Parley, which contains a synopsis of our faith and Doctrine, which I distribute, and preach to members of Congress and others whenever a favorable opportunity presents itself--I visit Mrs judges of the Supreme Court of the United States, once a week to instruct her in the principles of our faith and doctrine. She has read the Voice of Warning and Brother Spencer's Letters, with which she has expressed herself highly gratified. She is now reading the Book of Mormon, and a little work entitled the Book of Mormon proved.  She has a Spirit of inquiry, and her interest in the work is increasing.  Sideways text Remember me to Sister Woodruff, and accept for yourself the assurances of your friend; J. M. Bernhisel End sideways text ENDENTRY Washington City March 22, 1850  Dear Brother, I hope you will excuse my delay  in replying to your last favor, my time since  its reception has been very much occupied. Our application for a government over the valley of the Great Salt Lake and the adjacent region, has given me many anxious moments since my arrival in Washington. There is not a shadow of a doubt that we shall not be admitted into  the Union as a State. But the Hon Truman Smith has proposed to me a plan for a territorial govern- ment, which authorises us to elect our own officers, and the Central Government to pay their saleries. This would do admirably well, Judge Douglass has proposed a plan somewhat similar, which is to legalize our present constitution and form of government—Either would entitle us to a delegate in Congress, but not Senators—It is how- ever exceedingly doubtful whether Congress can be induced to grant us such a government. If we get but an ordinary territorial government, I entertain but faint hopes, from my knowledge ENDENTRY of men and measures here, that the President would nominate such officers as we would elect, and if he did the Senate would not confirm them, and if they did, they would at any moment be liable to be removed, and would almost certainly be when the present incumbent of the Presidency goes out of office. There are already hungry office hunters here  who are seeking for the offices in the event that we get a territorial government, and if some whippersnappers or broken down politicians should be sent out, who would not be accepta ble to us, to tyranize over us, we should certain- ly be brought into collison with the General Government, and if a common territorial govern ment be given us, and we should not accept it, it would be rebellion, and we should bring down upon us the indignation of the whole nation, and measures would be taken to enforce it, and it is superfluous for me to tell you what the consequences would be. For these reasons I have, after much anxious  reflection and serious deliberation, come almost to the determination, If I find that Congress will ENDENTRY not grant us such a form of government as will authorize us to elect our own officers, to withdraw our application for a government, at least temporarily, until I can see the authorities in the valley, or hear from them. We can get along very well with our provisional govern- ment, until our population is sufficient to entitle us to admission into the Union as a State, and this would be carrying out the President's wishes. Now, dear brother, I want you to tell me candidly what you think of this matter, and whether I should, in your  judgment, in the absence of instructions from the valley, be warrented in adopting this course I need not add that as early an answer as you can make will be acceptable—Brother Babbitt has taken his departure for the west.

We have not  heard anything later by the East. The Mail was accompanied by  our friend Devils gate with  about 20 of the brethren. They suffered much: subsisting for one  month on poor beef, and the next month on Hides. Brother Hey- wood considers he has gained quite an experience in cooking raw hides:  they boiled, roasted, stewed and fried all ways; they all lived through  it; and left as soon as they could get through for snow, and came  near leaving the Mail at last. Many had much anxiety about brother  Heywood, and all were glad to see him come home: he looks well,  with his long sandy beard. The Mail brought me 6 letters from you,  including the one sent by A. W. Babbitt, who as you know was  killed by the way. I was truly glad to hear from you and that  you was preserved in the railroad smash up.  I was glad to hear that you had got along so well with  bro. Taylor, in getting us out so good a history of the death of  Joseph. I have not yet seen it. I have not heard how it was  sent, if by mail I expect it will turn up by and bye when the  Winter mails arrive. I called on Bathsheba and read all my letters to her: she had received letters from you too. I was pleased with your dream,  and I believe that you will be enabled to start the cars, engine or  no engine that is visible, it will be right anyway. We will file it in the office.  We have had a hard winter in Utah, if 8 feet of snow in the  ^sideways text Received Sept. 3 1857 at Salt Lake  April 1st, 1857 Historian's Office Geo. A. Smith  Wilford Woodruff ^Copied^ end of sideways text^ ENDENTRY vallies, and from 1 to 100 in the mountains makes a hard winter; but we have lost but little stock in comparison with last year. The snow in the vallies has gone off so gradually, the ground is thorough- ly soaked 3 feet deep.  I do not know how much deeper. Spring has broke upon us mild and warm, the top of the ground is beginning to be dry, but the wells are raising.  Every kind of fruit trees; from the apple to the currant, are loaded with fruit buds, and some of the Peaches and Apricots are ready to blossom. I think it will be a fruitful year, for all kinds of fruit, grain and veget- ables. The cottonwood canal is nearly finished; it has been a great job. I expect the stone will come floating to the Temple, they are now hauling with cattle. The Temple foundation is surrounded with stone cutters who make rich sweet music. I expect after conference there will be several hundreds cutting stone, and the Temple will be pushed.  We have had a great Reformation this winter, some of the fruits are, all have confessed their sins either great or small, restored their stollen property, all have been baptized from the Presidency down: all are trying to pay their Tithing, and nearly all are trying to get wives, until there is hardly a girl 14 years old in Utah, but what is married, or just going to be. President Young has hardly time to eat, drink or sleep, in consequence of marrying the people and attending to the endowments. I never have had so much to do in my life. I would think it would wear him out. There has hardly been a ball or party for recreation through this Territory for the last 6 months. I have attended a meeting of some kind about every evening through the past winter, and have not visited your family much, nor any body else, not among my own but little, for 5 months. I generally get to bed about 11 or 12 o'clock. I have never ENDENTRY seen this people feel the importance of living their religion as much as they have done the past winters. I hope it will continue. the power of God has been with in preaching and teaching in all the Quorums and Ward meetings. I commenced with J. M. Grant before he died, and after his death the burthen burden of the care of the Missionaries rested upon me and bro. F. D. Richards: who was unwell consid- erable but attended most of the time. O. Hyde have been with me a part of the time. The Presidency and Twelve (except my self) and about 100 others are expecting to go on a summer Trip North to Salmon river.  This Spring C. C.  Rich will be with us about the first of May. I expect they will take a European mission, some missionaries will be called to Europe, and to the islands. President Japan- ese islands. The Lamanites are doing well, Arrowpeene and Kanosh with other chiefs are making great improvement. Arrow- peene preached a short discourse in the Tabernacle lately, it was good.  We have given up the Lead mines after making about 10 or 12.00 lbs. it is quite expensive and does not work as well as expected. a cotton company are called to go to the Rio Virgin. We are going to try the chinese Sugar cane this summer as far as we can get seed.  All is peace and prosperity with us throughout this Territory. some are going to California this Spring, several in the Southern settlements have started on the short roads, or cut off to go there, and no doubt some others will follow them soon.  Your family are all well, you and the brethren associated with you are ENDENTRY earnestly remembered in our prayers.  As far as the History is concerned, we finished matters up to the death of Joseph as far as we could; then brought up the other matters including the history of the Twelve up to the organization of the church Augt. 8. I then have taken up the history of Brigham  Young and his fathers family briefly, and now am at work on the history of the Twelve, from their first organization in a brief form, taking all that belonged to it, up to the 8 August 1844. We have no trouble now with the Gentiles here in court or anywhere else. It would amuse you to read one of the late scenes while in court filed in our office—too lengthy to insert—with Dr. Burr and some smaller fry, to bullyrag all our laws and their defenders, a  part of them came armed with colts, revolvers, it ended in T. S.  Williams resignation and Gen. Burr's dismissal from the Bar; and some others who intended to use the pistols went out of the house in the form of a sled using the seat of their honor for run- ners, dropping their loaded weapons while going out, which they never afterwards found. all has been quiet since, having but little lawing on hand.  Please not expose my succatash letter to the press, for I write for your own benefit and amusement, not guarded as I would while writing to men who publish papers.  Gen. Burr has written to the department as we are informed, accusing us of cutting off and wasting the government timber in the Kanyons. I expect he will have an invitation this Spring  of going to the upper mill in big cottonwood kanyon, and taking a ride down to Jordan on the top of a big pine log, (if he can stay on the top of it) and when he has finished his trip, if he thinks it will not cost all it is worth to get it, we will pay to Government all that is over, leaving him to be the judge.  Yours truly W. Woodruff ENDENTRY OFFICE OF The First Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints  P. O. Box, B.  Salt Lake City, Utah. May 22, 1893.  TO THE PRESIDENTS OF STAKES THROUGHOUT ZION,  Dear Brethren:  We deem it desirable and also consistent with the promises made to the Saints that a record be opened in which will be written the names of all who have contributed by way of donations towards the erection of the Salt Lake Temple, with the amount that each one has given. The name of no person, no matter how young, nor how small the amount subscribed, should be omitted. We shall be pleased to have you forward to this office a list of donors belonging to your Stake at as early a date as practicable giving the full name and address of every giver, with the correct amount placed opposite each name.  We are particularly desirous of obtaining particulars of those who have donated for this purpose since the laying of the cap-stone (6th April, 1892), but would also like your report to go back as far as possible and contain all amounts paid, including the fifty cent monthly donations, no matter how long ago they were received. We prefer that the names in these lists should be arranged alphabetically, but if this is inconvenient, the report can be made out by wards, with the names in each ward placed in alphabetical order.  With kindest regards, we remain, Your Brethren,  Wilford Woodruff Geo. Q. Cannon Jos. F. Smith ENDENTRY Aleppo, Turkey Feb 21st 1894  Prest. Wilford Woodruff.  Dear Brother  I write you in relation to a matter that is the cause of much trouble to us here in this branch of the church. Dispensing with preliminaries and to be brief I will say that we have an Elder here by the name of Geo. A. Vizerian who is giving us much trouble as follows—  In the latter part of Dec. last, while residing at Aintab in the performance of my mis- sionary labors I recieved a letter signed by all of the Saints except about three, asking me to come here (Aleppo) immediately as there was trouble existing in the church.  On my arrival here I found them to be in a sad condition. There was considerable enmity between Elder Vizerian on the one hand and the two Priests and the Saints on the other. Things had been going from bad to worse until a short time previous to my coming, when the Elder, (Vizerian would come to meeting on Sunday, administer the Sacrament and the Saints refusing to partake of it, he would say they were all damned and call them ap- ostates etc. and dismiss the services and go away.  I did not think it wisdom to enter into a judicial investigation of the matters for fear of iritating or widening the gap between them, so I appointed a meeting and after reminding them that we all had our faults and imperfections succeeded in having them all ask ENDENTRY forgiveness of each ^other^ promising to forget the past and live better in the future. I thought we had made a perma- ment reconciliation but it has proven not to be so. As I have now learned the facts I find the trouble came about in this way.  About two years or more ago, Elder Vizerian, the two Priests, and some of the Saints now here were living in Aintab. An elder by name of Garoutch was presiding over them. Elders Garoutch and Vizerian told the Saints that they were prophets, and Garoutch had a revelation, or revelations for their guidance; and he did many things that did not reflect any credit on the Latter Day Saints. Some months afterwards he (G) became insane, and some months later died a violent death. The American physicians after examination, by his convulsions etc. pronounced his death to be by poison. There seems to be some mystery concerning his death, of which Elder Vizerian knows but refuses to divulge.  The Priests and some of the Saints did not believe in the revelations of Garoutch whereupon he denounced them as apostates etc. Since Garoutchs' death Elder Vizerian denounces all who speak against him (G) and his revel- ations, especially one of the priests whom he calls a Judas, and they remained away from church.  Now that they have removed here, the troubles are renew- ed here of course. Elder Vizerian has been presiding here with the results as above stated, until my arrival. ENDENTRY He has been keeping the books, tithing etc. After our reconciliation as stated above, the saints desired and elected or sustained unanimously a brother Hagopian as clerk to keep the tithing accts etc.  When Elder Vizerian came to turn over the books and funds on hand he took his tithing and donations for several years past out of the fund and refused to turn it over. For the only man here holding the higher Priesthood to act in such a manner hurt the saints very much. To my questions as to why he did so he would only answer that he acted according to the dictates of the Spirit. I could only with much difficulty apease the indignation of the saints and I felt it my duty to say that a non-tithing payer was not in good standing or fellowship and according to Church order should not be allowed to ad- minister in any of the ordinances of the Gospel, which I have carried into effect, knowing that the saints would not recieve administrations at his hands.  For two months past we have been holding meeting three or four times a week having a little peace then turmoil alternately, caused by this elders' actions and sayings.  He comes to the meetings and sits quietly, but every opportu- nity he has he condemns the saints and prophesies that trouble will come upon them (not saying what the trouble will be) and thus keeps up an agitation that will give us no rest. Two nights ago at 12 oclock midnight he baptised two young men and administered Sacrament ENDENTRY to them etc. without my knowledge or that of the saints. When I learned of this I told him that under existing circum- stances he should not have done so, that the saints here nor myself did not approve it, to which he said "I do not care for you, the church or any man so long as God com- mands it me." When I ask him for evidence that I may know that he is commanded to do these things he only says "I bear my testimony to you that it is true: if you wish to know more ask God he will tell you."  He is an unmarried man and together with a young man named Geo. live in a house by themselves, where they have dreams and visions almost without number. From his mysterious sayings and actings actions I infer that he thinks they are those two prophets that are to come on this continent; in fact I am told that he has said so. Astounding as this statement may seem I verily believe that he considers themselves to be such, and he does not hesitate in telling me that all things are made known to them.  I say nothing against the manifestations of the Spirit for personal advancement and benifit, on the contrary I advocate it, but I understand from Doc and Cov's that he only who stands at the head of the church can recieve revelations for the church: else order would be subverted. He told me to day that he was spiritual president of the church here, I was but temporal. I was not inclined to believe, although I heard it said many times, that he ENDENTRY thought I accidentally saw a copy of his letter to you dated about Jan 12 or 13th 1894 in which he speaks of those two prophets.  He since told me several times that he expected a letter from you, shortly, which would open my eyes to things impossible to believe now and which would account for all his peculiar actions. I think you will under- stand his short, mysterious letter better after reading this. I think his letter was written to you upon the subject mentioned for your approval and confirmation. I present this case to you because he will not submit it to any lower authority, considering himself above any but yourself and agreeing to abide by your reply to his letter.  You will have perhaps have answered his letter before this reaches you. If you have understanding it fully, I hope it may settle our affairs here. If you did not understand it fully or have not yet an- swered it, I ask you to do so at your earliest convenience and let it be direct and emphatic that he may have a plain understanding of the same that we may be en- abled to establish peace and harmony, for a continuance of affairs as we have had them for the last two months or more will soon lead to the utter anihilation of this branch of the church. I ask you to answer this com- munication with all the instructions you deem it nec- essary for me to have upon this matter, or any others, also a copy toof your reply to him. ENDENTRY I ask these things only if in your best judgement and by the dictation of the Holy Ghost you see fit so to do.  I remain your brother in the Gospel of Jesus Christ  F. A. Huish.  PS. I think you know this bro. by correspondence at least.  Our church membership might have been doubled but for him, and some (especially the Priests) are remaining away from our services, and some postponing baptism because of him.  (I understand that it is informal to refer church troubles directly to yourself but as I stated he will submit it to no other, not even to the prest. of European mission promising to govern himself according to your reply) I have stated the root of the troubles only and there are many branches growing out of it. It is impossi- ble to describe the tumult and contentions we have had.  Trusting you may approve my actions I am, Respectfully,  F. A. H.

I desire from the bottom of my heart to comminu cate you my joy in beginning to a new year with the poeple of God. I thank God and know by the power of his Spirit that that Joseph Smith is Prophet, and his revelations are true, as it is written in the book of ENDENTRY Doctrines and covenants.  The Revelator asks— What is to be understood by the two witnesses, in the 11th  chapter of Revelations?  Such it was answered—  They are two Prophets that are to be raised up to the Jewish nation in the last days, at the times of restoration and to prophesy to the Jews, after they are gathered and build the city of Jerusalim in the land of their fathers.  How joyful to have faith to these words of happiness?  Another question— ENDENTRY What are we to understand by the sounding of the trumpets, mentioned in the 8th chapter of Revelations?  The Answer is given as you read Section 77. and 12 Verse.  I Raise God with power and spirit he has bestowed upon me, because the spirit knows the sixth Angel, having autherity to ordain eldesrs, one for destruction and one for salvation.

ENDENTRY Provo City, June 12  1889  President Wilford Woodruff.  Dear Brother,  In conformity with Circular No. 4, and given Notice of the Secretary of the General Board of Education, the three appointed Examiners met with the Graduates for Normal Certificates, at the B. Y. Academy, Provo, Monday, May 27, at 9 A.M. Sixteen, that is 14 gentlemen, and 2 ladies, reported. There were two more who had previously announced their in- tention to graduate, but one was taken ill, and the other was prevented from attending by a death in the family. It had been decided by the Board of Examiners to have the first three days devoted to the written examination, and the questions, (copies of which are herewith enclosed to be placed on file by the Secretary G. B. S.,) which had been previously submitted by each one of us to the Board of Examiners for approval, were placed successively on the Blackboard, and were worked out by the Graduates under my own supervision. Every answer received its percentage, the total of the whole set making the total of efficiency in that respective branch together them with the total in the practical and oral examination in the same study. A Graduate considering himself as ENDENTRY by any of the Examiners in any one point, should have the right of asking for an explanation, and if then not satisfied, of an appeal in the case to the Board of Examiners. Several explanations have been asked, which, however, proved satis- factory in every instance, and no appeal became necessary. It had been decided that in case of the Percentage in General Efficiency should fall^ing^ below 60, no Certificate should be issued. This occurred only in the case of Michael Barclay, 49%. That man is absolutely unqualified for a teacher; his answers in Grammar, Theory of Teaching, and Geography, seem almost to indicate a partially unsound mind. When he reported his intention to me to graduate, I cautioned him privately, but he is so full of his own conceit that nothing could con- vince him of his incapacity. He only attended the Acade- my one term some years ago, failing them entirely. I have also notified all Graduates that fell below 75% in any one branch to pass another examination in that par- ticular branch next ^under one^ year, until they reach an efficiency of at least 75%. During Thursday and Friday each one of us three held oral and practical examinations simultaneously in separate rooms, having a class ENDENTRY of schoolchildren (30 in number) divided between us for that purpose. Saturday morning we spent in consul- tation and arranging the statistics of our Examination. The results of which have been put into the hands of the Secretary in the form of a Schedule. As there may be cases presenting themselves during the summer, or the next school- year, of persons soliciting examination; we have proposed, therefore, that any one of us three, residing or being in the region of country of said person, might be commissioned by the chairman of Examiners, upon due application having been made in time, to hold that examination, each one of us furnishing the questions pertaining to this department. If this arrangement should meet your approval, our work may be facilitated considerably in such cases.  As the B. Y. Academy commences Aug. 5, and you have given me the privilege to remain with that institution the first 10 weeks for the purpose of organizing and starting the Normal Department in conformity with the requirement of Circular No. 4, I shall be at liberty to travel wherever you should desire me to go, on or after October 11 or rather October 4 already, the tenth ENDENTRY week being Conference week. I should desire to visit the northern Stakes, where churchschools are, during the hotter season and take the South during the fall and winter, if possible. As President Geo. Q. Cannon has granted me the privilege to have my name retained as Principal of the B. Y. Academy for the next year, I shall draw up the Circular for that institution, meet with the newly organized Stake Board, and make with them such ar- rangements as the interests of the institution maty re- quire during the protracted periods of my absence after the first ten weeks. By a private letter from Bro. Benj- Cluff, now at Ann Arbor, I learn, that he is inclined to come home at once, if his services would be required and a suitable salary could be promised him. It does not seem wisdom to me to make any more assurances and promises of definite position or salary before en- tering the churchschool-service, which step should al- ways be taken by the candidate bonafide, nor could we venture to place any man into s such a responsible position as the Principalship of the B. Y. Academy is, nor in on coming directly from the East, before we have  ENDENTRY ascertained to what extent his spirit and methods have been influenced by his eastern sojourn. I h Thus, I think, Bro. Cluff might work himself into it as my deputy during my periods of absence, until he can take it all. That was partly the course Bro. Tanner pursued after his return home and before going to Logan. In other respects Bro. Cluff would be preferable for that position to anyone else I know of. I also understand that the authorities of Bear Lake Stake have made ouvertures to Bro. Cluff; to be the Principal of their Academy. These Bear Lake people have done so many queer things educationally and  otherwise that I do not wonder at that course so much at variance with the instructions contained in the Circulars. The next four weeks will have to be spent most- ly at my office in order to have everything arranged in order by July 15th, when the Records should all be straight, and the annual Report to the General Board be made. The remaining three weeks, at least a portion of it, I hope to use for some much needed recuperation in the mountains.  With constant prayers for your welfare I remain  Your brother in the Gospel Karl G. Maeser ENDENTRY Provo City, July 17 89  President Wilford Woodruff.  Dear Brother,  The telegram of Bro. Reynolds, concerning those Stakes that have not yet secured Principals was just received. In answer Bannock  Stake Academy at Rexburg has not reported, but it is presummed that Bro. Nielson, will continue, although the former is just now on the Underground in consequence  of the unfortunate test oath trouble. To Cassia Stake Board I have written today in answer to Bro. Thos. E. Harper's letter  sent to me by Bro. Reynolds and among other points sugges- ted to them the name of Bro. Geo. Cole, who graduated this spring before the Board of Examiners and lives in that Stake. Franklin has not yet re- ported nor has asked for a successor to Bro. Cornwall, retired on account of ill health. Bear Lake Academy at Box Elder Stake Academy has no Principal and does not know how to pay one as they say. I have transferred Bro. Jos. J. Anderson from there to Richfield, and Bro. Hayes, resigned on account of taking a course in the Sciences. ENDENTRY Office General Board of Education. April 4, 1889.  President Wilford Woodruff.  Dear Brother,  In compliance with your letter of March 2nd, instruc- ting me to visit the Stake Academies at Salt Lake, I started on the thus appointed circuitvisit Thursday, March 21, and have the honor to submit herewith and subjoined re- port of the work assigned me.  All necessary appointments in regard to my in- tended visit having been made with the respective Stake Boards and Faculties, and having placed my- self at their disposal for any good they might think I could do while with them, for the cause of true edu- cation, I met with the Salt Lake Stake Board of Education, Thursday, March 21, at 8 P.M. President Angus M. Cannon presiding, all members of the Board, and the Principal, Prof. Talmage, present.  During the progress of the meeting, a petition of this Stake Board to the General Board was called up again and read. The Secretary stating that it ^had^ had been duly forwarded a long time ago but no answer had been returned. The purport of the petition was the suggestion, upon the advice of the church-attorneys, that the General Board should take at once proper steps to in corporate the Stake Board of Education, as many very important property questions were involved. It was also stated that difficulties had arisen in regard to the name of their Academy, and a majority of the members seemed to favor the name of Brigham Young Academy, to assure ENDENTRY continued.  Kaysville Local Board of Education, wrote to me applying for a Principal for their "Academy". I have answered him, that I supposed the Board of Education for Davis Stake had  fully approved of their organization this being the case, the name of Bro. Allison, their heretofore district school teacher, so he is an entire stranger to me, and whom they desired for their Principal, should be presented to the Stake Board also for approval. If on their requested, that Bor. Allison should write a letter of application to me signifying his intention to enter the Churchschool- Service, which letter should be accompanied by a Bishop's Certificate of his standing in the Church, a Certificate of Efficiency of his Normal training from wherever he had graduated, and any testimonials for his practiced labor as a teacher which he may have. Then I should notify him when and where to report for his examination by a Representative of the Board of Examiners, in order to obtain a Certificate without which he could not assume the duties of that office. Davis Stake Academy in Farmington has correspon- ENDENTRY the benefits of certain bequests. The members ex- pressed themselves much satisfied with the labors of the Principal of the Academy and of his Associates.  Friday, March 22nd. I attended the classexercises of the  Salt Lake Stake Academy, in Theology, Grammar, Arithmetic, Physics, and a General Theological Class in the afternoon. If the unappropriateness of the premises of this institution for educational purposes, par- tially over some by many clever makeshiftarrange- ments, would only be the cause of some inconve- nience for teachers and students, this circumstance would be entitled to but a passing remark in my present report, but ventilation as well as light are so defective that the health of the students, in spite of  the great caution and vigilance of the Principal, is continually endangered. Although the exceeding- ly narrow stairs caused some crowding of students during changes of classes, the discipline and order- in the general management of the exercises deserves honorable mention. The students seem interested in their studies, their answers were bright and readily given, and their written work very commendable. I found the Daily Programme judiciously arran- ged, and the Plan of Studies carefully followed by the teachers. In the Faculty meeting at the close of the school in the afternoon, the reports of the Principal and teachers showed to me a united fand harmonious feeling in spirit and method of teaching. The general prospects of this Academy, intellectually and spiritually are exceedingly en- couraging. Although the singing of the Academy ENDENTRY continued  ded with me about a Principal. I proposed to them the name of Bro. Joshua Greenwood as Principal, who has since then visited there and the preliminaries for his engagement has already been made, pending the fixing of his salary, he demanding $800. I do not think this organization of a seperate "Academy" at Kaysville in so small a Stake a wise move. A secondary school as a feeder for their Stake Academy, should have been a better plan. I am afraid there is local jealousy at the bottom of it, and it forebodes no good for the educational interests of that Stake. The 18th Ward L. D. S. School has proposed Bro. David R. Allen as Principal, and Miss Mattie Snow as Lady Teacher. I have submitted that case to the S. L. S. Board and they write that they had no objection to Bro. Allen, provided he complies with the regulations for churchschool-teachers, set forth in Gen. Circ: No. 4. I have written Bro. Allen in the same manner, as I required Bro. Allison at Kaysville to do. With Coalville arrangements for the continuance of their former Principals have ENDENTRY Choir was creditable, the vocal art of Singing has not yet recieved that attentionin this institution which its importance demands, and the engagement of a Singing teacher for next schoolyear should form a point of earnest consideration for the S. L. S. Board. I regret that I had no opportunity to make the aquaintence of this lady teacher, Ms. Mattie Hughes, and ^therefore could not^ confer with her concerning her labors among the female students.  The S. L. Stake Board have made great efforts in preserving scientific apparatus and many valuable recommendations for the benefit of the Academy. By special request I delivered a lecture before the Students' Society that Friday evening, which was well attended.  Saturday, March 23rd I arrived in Logan at noon, and was informed at my arrival that I was expected to lecture that evening before the Polysophi- cal Society of the B. Y. College. The subject having been previously agreed upon. Although scarcely recovered ffrom a severe spell of sickness, and suffering under the affects of a cold I endeavered to perform that duty to the best of my ability, and was rewarded with a very appreciative audience. Sunday, March 24, I attended the Missionarymee- ting of the Collegestudents in the forenoon, and cannot express myself warmly enough in com- menting upon the Spirit pervailing in that meeting, manisfesting itself in the singing, prayers, and testimonies of the young people. After attending divine service in the afternoon I spent the remainder of the day in conversing ENDENTRY continued  been made. Tooele Stake has  erected a fine Academy building at Grantsville, and that they desire Bishop Wm. Collett one of my dear old Graduates, to be the Principal. But neither they nor he have mentioned anything to me about it. Bro. Wasatch Stake Board has conferred with me in person and in writing, sta- ting that they are vigorously striving to have everything ready by October 2 for opening. We promised to meet again and I am waiting for his communication in order to make a suitable selection for a Principal, as for various reasons a very careful choice for that Stake has to be made. Springville L. D. S. High School is without a Principal; Bro. Simon Eggertson the for- mer occupant of that position, having been called to the position of Bishop's Counsellor in the II Ward, Provo, will goin teach the District school in that Ward by general request. The Local Board have not yet ap- plied for a successor hoping to persuade Bro. Eggertson to remain with them. Ephraim and Filmore Academies retain their Principals like  ENDENTRY with the Principal and some teachers of the College about the affairs of their institution in order to obtain as thorough an information in regard to their station as words could convey. Monday, March 25, was devoted entirely to witnessing the class- exercises, in Theology, Rhetoric, Grammar, Mathe- matics, Geography, Reading, Theory of Teaching, General History, and Penmanship. Although only the Principal, Prof. Tanner, and one of his teachers, Bro. Todd, are Graduates of our Normal Academy, and, therefore, thoroughly posted in regard to our method and system of teaching, it was very gratifying to ob- serve the readiness with which especially, their  the teachers of Mathematics, Bro. Kerr, has identified with himself with the new plan of teaching.  The premises and accomodations of the College are excellent both in regard to senitary as well as disciplinary arrangement. The Ladies' Depart- ment, comprising ^also^ a Library and Readingroom, in charge of Mrs. Jennie Tanner, constitute a promi- nent feature in this institution. In Music, both instrumental and vocal, the B. Y. College stands ahead of any of the institutions in our Church- schoolorganization, and I commend Bro. H. Wahl- strom as a Music teacher of highmerits. The Vocal Art should raise great attention throughout our Churchschoolorganization, and I should suggest to the General Board to make this branch of study an object of special recommendation in the next Circular. Since the appointment of Prof. Tanner as Principal, the B. Y. College has ENDENTRY continued  Provo. There is, however, a circumstance arising in I have to report to you. Some time ago, Bro. C. N. Lund, of that place, wrote to me for instructions in regard to the estab- lishment of a L. D. S. school in that there as an offset to the sectarian schools which they are ifflicted with. I told him to apply to their Stake Board for permission to organize and then I should take pleasure in assisting them to the best of my ability. It appears, however, that President Peterson is afraid that a local institution at Mt. Pleasant will interfere with the development of their Stake Academy at Ephraim, and refuses his consent. There is now ^being^ at Mt. Pleasant, Bro. Geo. Chris- tensen, who graduated with the highest honor this spring before the Church Board of Examiners. He taught formerly a Grammar School at Mt. Pleasant, is a favorite with the people, and carries an enormous influence with the young people. They are now afraid that I will call that young man away and give him a prominent position in one of  our Academies, and implore me not to make ENDENTRY undergone a very thorough reorganization in order to bring it more into line with our another church- schools, a change, which naturally should suggest a corresponding retardation in the regular and accustomed advancement of the students. It gives me great pleasure, however, to state, that the general- ity of the students not only seem to be reconciled to the new regime, but appear to have entered into the spirit of it with vim and delight.  By mangement, Bro. Samuel Cornnell, Princi- pal of Franklin, Idaho met me at Logan, and I learned from him following points of interest concerning his Academy: His health has been greatly im- paired by overtaxing himself. He had only a lady teacher to assist him, who was not acquain- ted at all with any systematic way of teaching. He had no maps, charts, or any utensils of con- sequence to assist him in his labors, and no apparatus of any kind. Over 100 students in atendance.  He gave a public examination which was highly commended upon. The peculiar situation of the Saints in his neighbor- hood has had a depressing effect upon this new educational enterprise at present. He is worn out, intends resigning at the end of the present term, and take another years's Normal Course as a Postgraduate. ENDENTRY continued  any appointment for him, until they would write again, trying in the meantime to get Pres. Peterson's con- sent. I should plead this cause before you, that you might assist them by your counsel. Bro: Allen R. Cutler, Principal of Panguitch Stake Academy writes, that the Stake Board there has concluded to keep their Academy only 30 weeks per year, and that they would pay him monthly at $7500. Bro. Cutler is not willing to continue under such conditions as he wants to be employed for the whole year, he rather will go to the Provo and study the higher courses I wrote Bro. Allen with the request to submit my letter to that Stake Board also, stating that Pres. Woodruff did not approve of limiting the school year to such an extent, and that I had no Principal that would be willing to accept position under such a condition. We expected our teachers to be employed all the year round, will not to be compelled to travel around the country as bookagents, serving machine agents etc. a portion of the year to make a living, or keeping strolling  ENDENTRY In meeting with the Faculty of the B. Y. College, on Mon- day afternoon, I found the Daily Programme ju- diciously arranged, the progress in the exercises re- gistered weekly, and the plans and instructions of the Principal conscientiously observed. A con- traction in the number of instructors for next schoolyear seems to be desired, and Bro. Apperly, who is also County Superintendent of Distr. Schools, intends to retire from the College. On account of the absence of most of the members, a meeting of the Stake Board of Education could not be held, but it was suggested by Bro. Geo. W. Thatcher, that the members of that Board could meet at Salt Lake during Conference. The title of College for this institution is at yet somewhat inappropriate, but the facilities of the school are so excellent, that by judicious management the Collegestatus may be obtained within a comparatively short time. I arrived at Brigham City, Tuesday, March 26 at 2 P.M. and was hospitably recieved and entertained by Apostle Lorenzo Snow. A meeting had been appointed in the Tabernacle in the evening, in which by request I addressed the congregation on the objects of our churchschoolorganization in gener- al and ^of^ the Box Elder Stake Academy in particular. The fornoon of the following day was devoted to attending the class exercises at the Academy used to meeting with the Faculty at the consultation. The Faculty had consisted of the Principal, Bro. Jos. J.

My son Reinhard has concluded to remain another year as Principal. I met twice with the Stake Board, and procured them an Assistant Teacher in the person of Bro. Daniel Beck, and of our last Spring's Graduates. The Academy will occupy the so called II Ward Meeting house until after the end of the September term of the District Court by Nov. 1 when the new Court house is to be occufined and the old promisses of the Academy will be vacated. Kanab Stake Board will be ready by October and will write again for a Principal, when all arrangements have been per- fected. I ahve been compelled to recall Bro. Oscar  Vance from the District school at Parowan, and to send him to Moench. Bro. Vance being one of our most intelligent church school teachers will be an indispousable acquistitive to the Weber Stake Academy at Ogden. This move being  ENDENTRY of the Programme to suit the reduced number of attendance. The Principal as well as his Assistent, Ms Sadie Tanner, are working by a carefully de- vised Daily Programme, are following closely their laid out Plan, and register their weekly labors acording to instructions. Several classes had to be reconstructed at the beginning of the present term on account of the change of teachers, but it was gratifying to note the readiness with which the students had accommodated them- selves to the new classification. This is the first, or experimental year of this Academy and, like all new enterprises, has to establish its reputation more corresponding influence. The good begin- ning made will furnish the institution a fair starting for the next academic year. Bro. Anderson, being a young man, has needed sev- eral times kind words of encouragement to arouse him from a growing despondency in regard to the work assigned him. A very interesting Board-  meeting was held the previous afternoon, which was attended by Pres. Lorenzo Snow, the Principal, all the members of the Board but one, and by myself. The Principal complained of lack of ap- paruyus, maps, and books, of sufficient prepar- ation of students on entering the Academy, and the frequent changes of the teachers. The members of the Board expressed sucessively their satisfac- tion with the teachers and their determination to advance the interests of the Academy. The Board intends to enlarge the premises and the illegible ENDENTRY vigorously but mainly protested against by the school- authorities at I suggested to them the advise- bility of organizing a Stake Board and get a Church- school, where it should give me great pleasure to send them as good a Principal for their Academy, as I for- merly had done for their district school. I was told in St. George Academy continues under the same Principalship and Faculty. Snowflake Academy, Arizona, writes under June 26, for President Jesse M. Smith, that their Academy building is now in good condition, having comfortable ac- comendations for 50 scholars. But they are in a  quarndary for a Principal, as Bro. Webb, their Principal heretofor, has a large family and cannot afford to labor any longer for such a small salary. They would like to have Bro. Dennis Harris, now in the Southern Mission, but think the same difficulty will be incountered  in his case, although it might be more advan- tageous for him to be with them in Arizona than to be exposed to perciovation in Utah.

The prospects of this institution are bright and there is no doubt that the people of the Stake will pat- ronize ^the institution^ in future to a great extent. Wednesday, March 27, I started in arrived with the afternoon train at Ogden, where I was cordially received by President Shurtliff, and conveyed to his house; to recuperate before the meeting of the Stake Board in the evening. My health being some- what impaired. The meeting of the Stake Board of Education, President Shurtliff presiding, was held in the Courthouse and was attended by all the members. The amount of tuition formed a great part of the discussion,  as it had to be fixed very  low in consideration of the peculiar sitution of educational affairs in Ogden. They have accom- modation just now for about 1575 students, and have three rooms at their disposal. The necessity of a schoolbuilding of their own was declared to be very urgent, and Pres. Shurt- liff intimited that he had a scheme, although not yet fully matured, to obtain one. The em- ployment of a Ladyteacher, and of a teacher of Music was recognized as a matter of great importance. The entire schooltime on the following day from 8 A.M. until 4 P.M. was spent in witnessing the classexercises of the Principal and his first Assistant, Bro. Waldram,  in attendance; his second Assistant, Bro. E. Cutler, one of the Normal students of the B. Y. Academy ENDENTRY Bro. Smith writes in a beautiful spirit and if anything would be done for the Snowflake Acad- amy, it should be done. St. John's Academy for President David K. Udall, reports that their Principal, Bro.

These are all the Acad- mies which I have anything about.  Lady Teachers I have carried on quite an extensive correspondan- ce in regard to Lady teachers, and I think as got all the schools supplied in some way. Several places like Beaver for instances, arrange- sments have been made for ^daily^ seasonal visits of a Matren to talk with all with the girls.  Music Teachers.

Considering that Bro. Moench has been out of practice for a number of years, his classwork, consisting thus for mostly of the intermediate grade, is very satisfactory, and some points which I called his attention to will by strict observance, facilitate his labors greatly in future. Bro. Waldram is what may be called a teacher of the old school, whose methods of teaching will scarcely harmonize for a great length of time with the rest of the Faculty of this Academy. The Primary Grade was conducted by one of Bro. Moench's Normals in a mattnner highly credi- table for this young beginner, especially as he conducts his classes only temperarily during the absence of Bro. Cutler, who has since returned to Ogden. I addressed in the evening a large audience under the auspices of the Polysophical Society of the Weber Stake Academy, and started Friday, March 29, in the morning with the train for Farmington, where I had been re- quested to attend the monthly Priesthoodmee- ting of that Stake on the establishment of a Stake Academy.

That same morning returned to Salt Lake City, and thus close this circuitvisit  There are several pionts of a general nature that have been brought out during this circuitvisit in my conversations with members of Stake boards and Faculties.  1. That only teachers be employed by Stake Boards that hold a Certificate in this for a Pri- mary, Intermediate, or Academic Teacher, issued by the General Examining Board.  2. The difference in the grades of a among our Church Academies is so wide, that ^a^ well defined grade should be established for each, until changed by order of the General Board.  3.

Dear Brother,  Since my last letter of the 3rd inst. to you the work in our church- school-organization has been going on at an increasing ratio, and consider it my duty to make a short summary report to you as far as I have been able to obtain information. As until the times of the issuing of Circular No. 2, my intercourse with the various Academies was confined to illegible occasions when I was either instruc- ted by you to write to certain parties, or my assistance was so- licited by Stake Authorities or Teachers themselves, a systemat- ic operation of all our existing schools, tending to a harmo- nious blending of all our labors to a common end, could not very well be attempted, without the appearance of of- ficiousness on my part, which very suspicion would do more harm than any possible good could have been gained by premature overanxiety. But your Circular, putting affairs at once into proper shape, enjoins simply upon me the duty to inform myself to some extent in regard to the spirit, condition, and results of every church- school, and to labor with the end in view, that every school of our organization feels itself as a constituent part of a ENDENTRY Provo City, June 29, 89  President Wilford Woodruff. Dear Brother,  Referring to a passage in my letter of the 24th inst. to the Secretary Bro. Joshua Green- wood whom Box Elder Stake Academy, versa Bro. J. J. Anderson resigned, I beg leave to make following additional reports: Bro. Greenwood, being a man with a family, and naturally anxious about any disposition to be made of him in the church school ser- vice, wrote to me about some decision. I did quiet him until I should receive an ^answer^ from President Clawson of Brigham City to my letter of inquiry. Thatis answer ar- rived this morning but leaves me in the dark as much as ever, at least as far this Academy is concerned.   Bro. R. Clawson states in the first place, that they should like to know to what extent the General Board will assist them, and then, what amount Bro. Greenwood desires as salary. In the second place he says, if the General Board would pay the Principal's salary, the Stake Board could meet the other obligations such as providing for assis- tant teachers, running expenses viz. viz.; otherwise they ENDENTRY continued.  harmonious whole, is conducted in accordance with the spirit of the Gospel, and by methods corresponding with those that thus far have enjoyed the sanction of the General Authorities of the Church, and the support of the Saints through- out Zion. I submit, herewith a few points, intended to be communicated to the various Principals for report, so that I can make a summary report to you previous to next April Conference.  Suggestive Points to the Academy Principals. 1. Give full name, Priesthood, Graduating, and Curriculum, Age, and Salary of every teacher, whether regular or Specialist. 2. When was your Academy organized? 3. Give names of successive Principals, and ^names of^ teachers under each. 4. Which department does your Academy consist of? 5. Make a general report about the condition of your promises, furniture, and utensils. 6. What is the condition or prospect of your Laberatory, Cabinet, Library, and Scientific apparatus? 7. Do you hold regular faculty meetings with Minutes on record? ENDENTRY 2. continued  could not see their way through. Thirdly, that they had paid Bro. Anderson $60000; 1/2 Cash; 1/4 Mdse; 1/4 Tithing which arrangement had been of considerable benefit to the Academy. As points 2 and 3 hinge on the outcome of point 1, no definite idea presents itself to my mind upon which I could formulate a proposition to Bro. Green- wood, who wants to make his arrangements before  the opening of the school year.  There is a great deal of crowding upon me just now going on by many of the teachers that have not  yet been disposed of, "to know what their disposition is to be, as the district schools are after them with enticing propositions. I wish these Stake Boards would hurry up their reports, in regard to their wants of Principals and Teachers, that I could dispose of them. I am afraid, that when all available teachers have secured positions for themselves, we in the church- school-service have to take what is left, instead of having the first choice.  With constant prayers for your welfare I remain Your brother in the Gospel. Karl G. Maeser ENDENTRY continued.  8. Do you keep your Register of Studies, Term Record, and Annual Record? 9. Please to furnish me a copy of your Plan and your Daily Programme. 10. What dates are your Public Examinations? Please to instruct me in regard to these or other points of a similar nature you should desire to have attended to.  As the B.Y. Academy has now reached the number of 326 registered students and still more coming, and in addition to this, Bro. N. L. Nelsen, one of my principal teachers has been prevented from being at his post on ac- count of dyphtheria in his family with no prospect of speedy recovery, my labors have multiplied greatly upon me, and prevent me, therefore, from visiting occasional- ly one or the other of those Academies just now, al- though quite a number of them are constantly asking me to come.  Bro. St. George seems to be getting on nicely and reports enthusiastically about his labors.  Beaver, at my advice has  ENDENTRY Provo, November 29 88  President Wilford Woodruff.  Dear Brother,  According to your instructions, received this morning per letter from Bro. Pan- guitch, that Bro. Allen R. Cutler had arrived here from his mission last Monday, and occupied himself with taking notes and getting posted in regard to organizing and conduc- ting that new Academy, ^and that^ he will start at once south, and telegraph from Milford when he expects to reach Panguitch, when it would be desirable to meet at once with the Stake Board of Education for the purpose of arranging matters. I explained to Bro. Crosby the unavoidable cause of delay which has caused them so much disappointment.  Bro. Olaf Larsen has started for Woodruff to take charge of their churchschool, and Bro. A. N. Tolestrup started this morning for Morgan City, to open that Ac- ademy, Dec. 3.

Although the people feel to sustain him, he is much discouraged for want of financial support, having to run the "Southern Utonian" as proprieter and editor to make a living, as he cannot get more than about 50% of his pay from the Academy.  Bro. Josiah Hickman, found the Millard Stake Academy, at Fillmore, almost dried up, so that he had to commence with only 10 students the first day; but he is a very ener- getic man, and expects to work up the institution soon to a living status.  Bro. Isaac Hages at Richfield, is a general favorite with the Authorities, people, and students, and his in- fluence for good among the youth in that region is very gratifying.  Bro. Ephraim, has opened with an attendance of over 70, and reports himself much pleased with the encouragement which he receives from the Authorities and the people of Sanpete Stake.  Bro. Springville, has suc- ENDENTRY continued.  ceeded in stopping altogether the attendance of Mormon children at ther Gentile-schools, and is doing a good work in that place.

They are in an overcrowded condition, had to dismiss the Preparatory Department in order to make room for the larger students, and almost a hundred applicants had to be refused admission. This case demands serious consideration, and I should suggest, that the Bishops of Salt Lake City take this matter in hand, and organize at least four Preparatory Churchschools in appropriate parts of the city, under our super- vision.  A letter of the 22nd inst. from Bro. Morgan City informs me, that they have organized there also a Stake Board of Education, himself Secretary, and want a teacher to commence school on the first Monday in December.

A letter from Bro. St. John's Stake Academy, in Arizona, arrived yesterday, asking me to send them a Principal for an Academy to be started within a month. I have no one to send this winter, as all competent teachers are engaged now.  The same answer must be given to Bishop A. Lofgreen, of St. David, Arizona, who calls for a teacher.  The B. Y.

President Wilford Woodruff.  Dear Brother,  Your favor of Nov. 1. came duly to hand. I most sincerely apologize to you for having put you to so much trouble for an entire- ly personal affair ^of^ mine, the impropriety for so doing is now perfectly clear to me. Not knowing how to get the desired assistance, as I was under the impression, that it could have been granted as well as not, I consulted with one of the Bretheren around you, who advised me to write to you about it. In future I shall fol- low the promptings of my new feelings in such things.  By request of Pres. Budge of Bear Lake Stake, I sent Bro. Jedediah Taylor, ENDENTRY continued.  From I have received no word anymore in regard to what they are doing or intend doing educationally.  If they should feel sour toward me for not sending them a more scientific teacher, they must blame themselves for not being more explicit in the beginnng, as I could have told them then, that I had none to send.  Bro. Spori Principal of Bannack Stake Academy, at Rexburg, writes that they have had a very encouraging opening with fine prospects before them.  I also received a communication from Bro. La Jara, Colorado, desiring information in regard to a building for a churchschool, which I have answered as well as I knew how at the 15th inst  Bro. Jos. G. Nelson, of Coalville, reports the inau- guraton of the Summit Stake Academy, and speaks in glowing terms of the energy and foresight of the Authori- ties of that Stake in providing for the new Academy.  Thus I have endeavored to lay before you a short summary report of our Academies, as for as  ENDENTRY continued  one of our Past graduates, to take temporary charge of the B. Y. S. Academy at Paris, with a letter of explanation. I suppose that there were no students in that part of country yet ready for higher academic studies, but that they needed it a solid fundamental instruc- tion previous to next school year's work. when I should find a Professor for them, as it was done in Logan. They seem to have, however, higher views up there already, and Bro. Taylor was not accepted for not teaching the higher mathe- matics. Bro. Tayler has accepted, therefore, the districtschool at Montpelier for this winter.  I have written the Bretheren at Pan- guitch, as directed, that Bro. A. R. Cutler, ENDENTRY continued  I have been able to gather information.  The idea that more Academies might be attempted to be started this winter, worries me, as I should have no more teachers for them.  The Preparatory Schools in Salt Lake, I spoke of above, do not trouble me so much, for, if they ever be organized, I think I can find teachers for that kind of work.  I am troubled in my mind abut this lengthy communication to you, especially in these days of tribulation, when all hell seems to have her forces out to attack the Cause of God, but I hope, that after the perusal of the letter, you will find  few moments time, to dictate a few instructions to me, in  side of which I may go ahead in the great work of education of the youth of Zion.  May the God of Israel ever sustain you and the Bretheren of the Twelve in your great respon- sibilities is the constant prayer of  Your brother in the Gospel Karl G. Maeser ENDENTRY continued  would be released from his mission to take charge of their Academy. I have opened correspondence with them, in order to assist in the work of organization.  The reports from the St. George Academy are very cheering, and will come before you as soon I shall be instructed by you to officially communicate with all the Principals in order to get some reports from them.  My son Reinhard, Principal of Beaver Academy, is very much discouraged there, but I have labored with him that he should not send in his resignation, until he had asked your advice in the matter.

As they want it also for a lecturehall, to hold their quarterly conferences in, and both purposes re- quire different sizes it will be necessary to erect a twostory building, the groundfloor for the school, and the upper story for the Hall.

Dear Brother,  Your favor of the 24th ult., enclosing letter from Brother Udall in regard a Stake Academy building was duly re - ceived, and enclosed please find a suggestive rough sketch, as I have been able to adjust the required items in my mind.  A Lectureroom for Stake Conference pur- poses, to hold about 500 people, and premises for an Academy are so widely different in their nature of operation, that I could find no other plan suitable, but by separating them into a lower and upper story. The classrooms below have been designed on the prin- ciple of 16 sq ft. to the pupil, which allows sufficient room for aisles, recitation place before blackboard and teacher's desk.  I have located no windows, leaving that to the building committee to determine, in regard to their number, size, and form, all of which  depend upon their taste and extent of means. Any good mechanic can construct the building or its general plan after these rough Specifications.

Dear Brother,  The Brigham Young Academy commenced its  fourteenth academic year last Monday morning with  over 100 students, which number is still increasing, and  by the indications we expect one of the largest atten- dances this Academy has ever seen. There are now al- ready 45 Normals enrolled, of whom 10 come under  the Church appropriation thus far. The names of  those selected on the strength of promises given dur- ing last academic year, are as follows: Ephraim; Wm. Winters of ; John Johnson, of  ;  Alex- ander Nielson, of Provo; American  Fork; Panacca, Nev.; Mary L. Hansen,  of Annie  E. Carlsen, of   . There have been, however, so many Normals last year, who have paid their  tuition all along in the hope to come under the  appropriation, that I am in great embarrassment  in regard to some of them. Several have been  ENDENTRY 2. continued  pacified by me, and have made up their minds  to pay their tuition this second year also, while  others had no such expectations at all, and  have, therefore, asked for no benefits.  But a  few remain concerning whom I do not know  what to do. I have either to send them home again,  or pay their tuition myself. They are deserving, and  have had partly a promise to the effect, if there  should be a chance; their names are: Alice  Reynolds, of Annie Brown, of  Manti; and  George Middleton, of Jos.  Dunyon, of Draper. I lay the case of these five  last named students before you in the hope of  getting some instructions in regard to the course,  I shall take concerning them. The last two ^but one^ have  been practical teachers already. Our Normal  Department once enjoyed an additional appro- priation for ten students from the Utah County  Court, which for fear of "Liberal" opposition  had to be withdrawn, and we have kept up ENDENTRY Provo City, August 24, 1889  President Wilford Woodruff.  Dear Brother,  It is with great diffidence that I yeild to the necessity of submitting to ^you^ enclosed correspondence.  But as Bro. Crosby has written to you also about the difficulty, enclosing my letter to the P. S. Board per A. N. Cutler. I see no other way be- sides finishing the controversy.  Permit me to call your attention to the passage in my summary report to you, of July 17, where on page 6, I refer to the Panguitch Stake Academy.  As my letter concerning the matter has been forwarded to you by Bro. Crosby, a comparison bet- ween my report to you and that letter will show the correctness of my statement.  My enclosed letter to Bro. Crosby of today, will furnish the last argument in the case, and I shall abide by your decision.  If you shall direct not otherwise, please let Bro.  Geo. Reynolds send my letter to Bro. Crosby.  With kind regards  Your brother in the Gospel  Karl G. Maeser  Please return Bro. Crosby's letter to him.

The reorganization of the de- partment also now, in order to meet the require- ments of our advanced grade in the Churchschool- service; and the special course for lady teachers, all of which arrangements the Junior Normals classes in the other Academies are not yet prepared  to comply with, necessitate extra pecuniary efforts,  that it will be impossible for this Academy alone  to make! I once before proposed to the General  Board the establishment of a Primary Drill  Department for our Normals, composed of about  24 to 30 children from Chartclass up to 11 Reader- grade, free of charge, to be conducted on the alterna- ting plan by Normalstudents entirely under the su- pervision of the Normal Professor.

Dear Brother,  Again I am under the necessity of submitting an enclosed letter to you for the purpose of getting instructions in regard to further proceedings in the matter. As the letter explains itself I need not refer to the special points there in myself.  Bro. Harnes of Kaysville, chairman of the local Board there, wrote me about two weeks ago, that Bro. Jedediah Taylor, whom I had recommended to them as their Princi- pal for this Seminary, had not sufficiently impressed them at his visit at Kaysville, and theyproposed, there- fore, to engage him only temporarily for one term.  This proposition Bro. Taylor refused to accept, and I wrote them that I had no teacher for them under such a con- dition as t would be extremely unfair to any teacher to be set adrift under some pretext, after all schools were supplied, and he stood a poor chance to get a position. Another thing it would be, if there were just complaints which should prove by investigation to be well grounded. They have reconsidered their original proposition, ENDENTRY 4. continued  future time, as I know and am convinced of its utility. I have opened correspondence with the leading  Publishing Houses of the United States in regard to  their educational works, especially Kindergarten- work, Normal Training, Courses in Ladies' Work,  Drawing, and Music, in order to recommend to our  teachers the best that can be found for their private  studies, or professional use. Upon your advice and  instructions on any or all of these stated points will  depend my course to a great extent in this Normal  Department. Knowing your great sense for justice  and equality for all, and at the same time the fin- ancial difficulties surrounding you, I do not  make these statements for the purpose of obtaining  more means, but to get your direction in regard to  the best course for me to pursue in the matter.  With kind regards Your brother in the Gospel Karl G. Maeser ENDENTRY 2. continued  and have engaged Bro. Taylor for the year.  I have instructed Bro. Taylor to call me the Stake President, Chairman of the Stake Board, and Principal of the Stake Academy at his earliest con- venience, and work in harmony with their instruc- tions. A course for which a promise mostly  complete is set by the 18. Ward L.D.S. Seminary and the L.D.S. College at Salt Lake City.  I am ready to visit Kays- ville at any time you shall appoint.  As I have an appointment for Mt. Pleasant, Friday, Aug. 30, to meet with the people in their in- terest of their Seminary, I should be thankful for any instructions you should desire to give me for the occasion.  Please let Bro.

Rg, Saturday, Febr. 8, at 1 P.M. having tele- graphed my arrival to Bro. L. M. Olsen, at that place. Arri- ving at Price at 5 P.M. was kindly recieved by Bro. Olsen and hospitably entertained by him until Sunday morn- ing. Starting for Huntington at 5 A.M. arriving at the place at 9 A.M. met President Emery Stake at the residence of Bro. Howard, his second counsellor, and President of the Stake Board of Education. One hour's conversation before the morning meeting convinced me of the existence of a strong party feeling about the location of the Academy. Huntington or Castle Dale were the watchwerds, and each party endeavored of its influence are in their favor Stating, however, to these bretheren your instructions, that neither yourself nor the General Board desired to influence them either way, leaving the settlement of their question entirely to the Saints of Emery Stake, I had no authority whatever to take sides.  When I found that Presidency of the Stake was divided, the Stake Board in its majority lean- ing one way, the High Council in its majority leaning  ENDENTRY continued  the other, and that even some bitter feeling was exis- ting, finding expression of in various insinuations and recriminations, which it would have been extremely unwise to permit to break out in open Conference.

I expected under God's blessing to have oppor- tunity to engender a spirit of unanimity on this sub- ject among the Saints before that Council should meet. The meeting was crowded both in the fore- and in the afternoon, the bretheren making the most of me both times as far as physical effort in talking was con- cerned. The subject of the welfare of the rising genera- tion and our educational system forming the chief- topic of all the discourses by the speakers. The Council was as stated above, and by request of Pres. Larsen I laid ^before the bretheren^ the principles according to which this whole deliberation should be conducted. To the great ENDENTRY continued  honor of the bretheren it must be said, that each side was represented sincerely, honestly, and in spirit wil- ling to abide by the decision of the whole Council. Once only a voice called for explanations of the cause of all the bad feeling in the past, that was frowned down, however, by the almost unanimous sentiment of the meeting. After Pres. Larsen had several times called for more expression of views on the subject, none re- sponding, "ipoustive" was called, and the vote taken. Pres. Larsen never committing himself for either side during all the proceedings. Votes stood: Huntington 10, Castle Dale 29. One of the bretheren from Huntington moved to have this vote made unanimous, which was carried. Seldom has it been my happy lot in my ministry to witness such a brotherly feeling as there was mannifested in that Council-Meeting, and I blessed the brotheren in the name of the Lord, tel- ling them, that I should have done the same of the vote had gone the other way, recognizing that the Spirit of God had guided them in their deliberations. The meetings on Monday more equally crowded and blessed with a spirit of anonimity and rejoicing ENDENTRY continued  The Conference sustained the decision of the Coun- cil to have the Academy located at Castle Dale. Only five brothern from Huntington voting against it. With  the exception of the rather ominous beginning of my mission on Sunday morning before meeting time, this has been one of the happiest educational visit  I have made. The Stake Board of Education met  at noon on Monday, accepted Bro. Alexander Jameson as Principal, voted him a salary of $60 per month, and concluded to run the Academy for two terms to the end of the schoolyear. I had intended to go over to Castle Dale with the brothern and start the Academy, but very stormy weather having set in during the day, the bretheren thought it better for me to return with Bro. Price at once, as it would not be safe to risk a return to Price, 22 miles on terrible road, in stormy weath- er this time of year. Arrived at Price at 9 P.M. and returned to Provo Tuesday morning.  With kind regards Your brother in the Gospel Karl G. Maeser ENDENTRY Provo city, Febr. 22nd, 1890  President Wilford Woodruff.  Dear Brother,  The copy of the letter of Bro. Attewall Wootton, Pres. of the Wasatch Stake Board of Education, to President  me and has been purused with  great care. As I cannot speak by personal knowledge of the case, but have before me only Principal Enoch Jorgensen's letter and two printed extracts from the "Wasatch Wave," which do not coincide entirely with  Bro. Wootton's report to Pres. Hatch, it reduces itself  in my mind to a question of veracity between the  statements in my possesion and the proceedings of  investigation before the Wasatch S.B.E. As the case has been reported, however, to the General Board by me, I have  nothing to remark anymore in regard to the merits of  the case. There is a statement, though, in Bro. Wootton's letter to which I must take exception. He criticises  Bro. Jorgensen's action in reporting ^to me^ the disgraceful conduct of a member of the Stake Board, by which  the efforts of the Stake Academy in reforming the general spirit of the youth in that neighborhood— were paralyzed to some extent Bro. Wootton con ENDENTRY continued  tents that the case should never have gone outside  of the Stake. Not mentioning the circumstance that the  offence had been known to every member of that Board for some time without anything being done about it until the General Board demanded an investigation, it was clearly that Principal's duty to ask my advice  in the matter, what position he should take in the  premises. I did advise Bro. Jorgensen in my answer in following words: "I fully realize, dear Brother, the  difficulties of your position in that peculiar Stake of  Zion, in fact, I was aware of it before you went there, and, as you know, for this reason the Lord directed me to  select you for that position. I have carefully read the two  clippings from the " Wasatch Wave" and your own com- mends upon them. It is a serious matter for a member  of a Board of Education to disgrace himself in the manner  in which Geo. Cluff has done it, and I shall report  the circumstance at the meeting of the General Board  next Friday, Febr. 7 for instructions." There were some  general instructions in my letter to Bro.

Dear Brother,  In compliance with your instructions of Sept 7th recieved per telegram, Far- mington and Kaysville for Sept 11 and 12 respectively. Having a few hours to spare on Tuesday, Sept. 10, between my calls at your office, I spent them visiting the 18 Ward L.D.S. Seminary, Horace Cummings, Principal, Mrs. Hardy and Miss Snow, Assistants.  I found the three classrooms, thus far occupied well filled with pu- pils, and the recitations in running order.  I found, however, the Daily Pogramms not yet in a settled and well defined order, nor was there a Plan for the various classes made out.  The discipline in Bro. Cum- mings' department did not seem to be as yet firm- ly established, while the recitations of the two lady- teachers deserve much commendation in this respect. I have called Bro. Cummings' attention to these points and have received the assurance that I shall find these draw backs over come at my next  visit.  The recitations themselves, how ever, reflect much credit upon those three teachers.  The pupil  ENDENTRY continued  emergency. I am decidedly of the opinion that Bro. Jos- gensen has simply acted in the line of his well defined duty, as much as it was mine to report the case to the General Board. I should very much desire, that Bro. Wootto should be instructed to that effect, as this case estab- lishes a precedent for similar ones in the future. If the President of that Stake Board and the other members are of the opinion that the Principal of the Academy has overstepped his lines, the position of Bro. Jorgensen becomes to that extent more difficut, than it is already.  With kind regards Your brother in the Gospel Karl G. Maeser ENDENTRY went through this exercies with spirit attention, and lively interest, showing such progress the short time taken into consideration.  My next visit will be one whole day, when I shall be able to form a more correct estimate of the spiritual and intellectual standing of the insti- tution.  Wednesday, Sept. 11 I arrived at Farmington in time for the opening of the morning exercises at the Davis Stake Academy, Bro. Joshua Greenwood, Principal, James Steed, and Mr. Welling, Assistant. The students were divided into three departments, located one in the main- hall of the Meetinghouse and the other two in Council- shop wherf and vestry.  Considering the somewhat inconvenient arrangement of the passages and studies, and the entire unappropriateness of the locality for schoolpurposes, the order, quickness, and discipline maintained by the students did not only reflect very creditabilty upon the Principal and Teachers, but madd purified as much at home with them as if that school had been in operation for years in our churchschool system.  I attended every recitation in the fore-and afternoon, alternating between them as circumstances suggested, and cannot ENDENTRY too much in praise of the labors of these teachers and their Principal. In the afternoon a young Bro. Willer from Farmington made his appearance, in the Academy, and took charge of classes in Gen. History, Algebra, and Physiology in a manner that astonished me, and I recommend that young man to your attention, for there is a rising young teacher in him. I have advised Bro. Greenwood to have Bro. Miller apply for a license as teacher in the Churchschool- service. The Students of that Academy, are full of enthusiasem for their studies, and go any length for their Principal, as do the Authorities and People of Farmington. President Smith, his counselors, and several mem- bers of the Stake Board of Education met with me also in consultation about the educational affairs of the Stake especially in regard to the Kaysville embroglio. It was arranged that the Stake Presidency and myself should meet on day ^Thursday^ Sept. 12 at 5 P.M. with the Local Board of the Kaysville Seminary and try to come to an understanding.

Pleasant Wednesday, March 12, at 5 P.M  Mt. Pleasant Seminary.  March 13. Bro. Clementine  Erickson, Assistant and Lady-teacher. The Seminary occupies the upper story of the Coop-Store, two rooms, commodious, well lighted and ventilated, nicely furnished, separate entrances to each room, aby the liberality of Bro. Madsen, owner of the building, under very resonable conditions in regard to rent for premises and use of furniture. There can be over 200 student accommodated. 100 stu dents have been in attendance during the two terms the  Seminary has been in existance thus far; they were classified in a IV and V Reader grade; forming, how- ever, for a start, only one department, called Preparatory. The members of the Local Board have taken a very active part in the development of their Seminary, realizing the necessity for their utmost efforts in counteracting the influence of the Presbyterian Academy at Mt. Pleasant. Bro. Christensen, the Principal, is one of our most prom- ising Churchschool-teachers, combining his labors in the Seminary with his appointments in the Sunday- ENDENTRY and energy of the Authorities and People of that Stake. After schoolhouse at Farm City, some members of the Stake Board, and School illegible  students said myself meet in the upper room of the Academy.  Prin- cipal and Teachers made their reports and I had to answer several points of inquiry about manag- ment and organization where I especially accen- tuated the duties of the Lady teacher to regard to her particular mission in our churchschools.  Counsellor Hays took me the same pruening in his buggy to Kaysville in answer to a special invitation from that Local Board to attend a Soiree in the Seminary building gotten up for the purpose of raising some more means for school furniture and utensils. At the visit and at Pres. John R. Barnes we were joined by Presidents Smith and Call of Davis Stake. The new Seminary-building is finished and reflects much credit upon the enterprise of the people of Kaysville and the management of Bro. Barnes, as Chairman of the Board.  It was arranged, that all discussion of the misunderstanding between the stake Authorities and the Kaysville Board ENDENTRY school and in the Mutual Improvement Association. The influence of that young man among the young people at Erickson, as lady- teacher, seconds the labors of the Principal in her manage- ment of the lady-students. The classwork done under my observation during the day showed a satisfactory efficiency considering the short time the Seminary has been in existence. A Boardmeeting and a lecture on our Churchschool system in the meetinghouse at night on our Churchschool System, concluded the proceedings of the day. The following day, Friday, March 14, was Public Examination at the Seminary. Class exercises, Resitations, Vocal Music, and Presentations of tokens of respect to the Teachers from the Students, Speeches by Members of the Board, Patrons of the Institution, exhib- ition of Ladies Work, Specimens of Drawing and of Penmanship, were features of the occasion, that marked the opening of a new era of education in  Mt. Pleasant. The mission I gave ^offered^ to the young people in the name of President Woodruff, to set henceforth a good example in all things before their companions was respect accepted by them enthusicastically.  Saturday, March 15. brought me to Ephraim, where I spent the day in getting posted about the affairs of the Stake Academy in conversations with President Greenwood.  Sanpete Stake Academy.  The Academy occupies as yet a building not very well adapted for schoolpurposes. The lower room houses ENDENTRY should be postpound until the councilormeeting on the following day, in consequence of which arrangment we spent a very enjoyable at that inceedingly will coudor- ted entertainment. The size of the Kaysville Seminary- building is the same as that of Farmington Academy- building with the difference that Farmington is now building the right wing from the main entrance, while Kaysville has built the left wing. The finishing in- side is tasteful and subsationtial and will be similar in both also. As the Kaysvile Seminary was not ready for opening until September 16, I had the time on Thursday, Sept. 7 at my disposel until 5 P.M.  Th. which I thought I could occupy to greater ed- vantage by opening a few hours at the Weber Stake Academy at Ogden, and took therefore, the morning train for that city. Bro. L. F. Moench, Principal and Oscar Vance, Assistant, with usual Volunteer Insuibels as Tutors, were found busily at work. The attendence is about 90, for an Academic and In terms with and ^I^ Preparator Dept. with some academic word smudged this added. Bro.

The Board owns a building which has been occupied thus far by the districtschools, but will be taken possession of by the Academy in the fall, with prospects of gre some improvements to insure greater convenience and facilitates to teachers and students. A lecture by my- self to the Polysophical Society concluded the day. Sunday, March 106 gave me the opportunity of witnessing the finest work in the organization of a Sunday school Theological Class that it ever has been my privilege to become acquainted with. The credit for which is accorded by the brethren to the untiring efforts of Bro. Alma Greenwood, that class seems to have collec- ted all the young people of Ephraim, of more mature aged filling the large hall to overflowing; they being attracted and held there from Sunday to Sunday by the spirited manner with which the exercises are conducted. An address the afternoon meeting in the Tabernacle, and a lecture in the evening at the same place concluded my share of that day's work. Monday, March 167, found me spending the whole day in witnessing the exercises at the Academy, conducted by Principal Greenwood, and his Assistant and Lady- teacher, Miss Carrie Henry. The students are divided into a Preparatory and an Intermediate Department, with several students taking advanced studies preparatory to a Normal Course. All the classes re- cited very creditably, and the spirit and discipline, ENDENTRY is in the first place the "Freeschool system, recently inaugure- ted in Ogden, to content against, them the indifference of a great many leading citizens from among our people, the many other schoolships. Seeing that Bros. Moench and Vance were actually doing good work, and that the blame could scarcely be with them, I called on, Apostle F. D. Richards for advice in the matter.  Although Bro. Richards was seriously indispossed, he entered at once with deep earnest into the subject, and it was thought best to lay this matter before you, if you would not instruct me, perhaps to confer with Pres. Shurtliff: for the purpose meeting with that Stake Board and the Faculty, and devise some plan by which the in- terest of the people of Weber Stake could be aroused in the educational movement of the Church for the welfare of their own sons and daughters asking instructions you should feel to give me in this re- gard shall be carried out to the best of my abil- ity.

But as the bre- therem of the Local Board in the following council meetings declared never to have seen Gen. Circ.

Bro. John R. Barner in the chair. Present: The Stake Presiden- cy, Bishop Barton and Councillors, the Members of the Local Board. Having became posted in general about some existing misunderstanding between the Stake Authori- ties and those of Kaysville, I was expected to open the dis- cussion and was called on by the Chairman to speak first. I outlined to the Brothern the mode of proceedure which the General Board under your direction has adopted and while has been my course throughout, gallos- trating it from instances occurring in our Church school- Organization, unphasising the fact that the order of the Priesthood and the Spirit of the Church was the keynote of all our operation. Saying that the best thing in the world can be spoiled by the wrong way of doing it. I showed the Brothern of Kaysville where in they had missed it, especially in not counselling with  ENDENTRY establish a Seminary.  Salina  Prest. myself spent an evening at that place and addressed the people in the evening on educational topics. Although one of my most trustworthy Normal Graduates has been laboring here for two years as a teacher in the district-school, having been recommended by me for that position, by special request of the Stake Author- ities, it seems that the contrary influences of that place are too much for all our efforts. Bro Hayes, the teacher, reported to me, that it has been impossible for him to keep the Mutual Improvement Association alive, and he is going away now altogether discouraged in regard to the outlook. That place seems to be a "Forlorn Hope," and ought to be held at any price.  Richfield.  Arrived at Richfield, Friday, March 21, and had to address the by special invitation, the County Teachers Association immediately after my arrival, and spent the rest of the day in conversation with Bro. Jos. J. Anderson about Academy-affairs.  Saturday, March 21. Went with Pres. Seegmiller and others to Monroe to fill an appointment for the evening. The Stake Authorities and Board of Education deem it advisable to have a churchschool in this place, although the mans ENDENTRY their Stake President, ever acting upon any advice of his in their educational movement. In honor to the brethern of Kaysville it must be said, that one after another acknowledges his ^and their^ mistakes declaring, if they had under- stood this matter as they did now, this ill feeling and misunderstanding would never have arisen. Only one member seemed to remain unreconciled and said so. President Smith addressed the meeting with great form, logic, and feeling, promising to get at the root of all these hankerings by communening with the High Council of the Stake. There certainly was mani- sested in the beginning of the remarks of all the Kaysville Brotheren a sentiment of accusations a- gainst the Stake Presidency, which I endeavored to  show them, was the very cause of taking them off the track. The meeting adjourned with the best of feeling, apparently, between all parties, and the difficulties amicably settled, pending some points to be adjusted here after at the High Counsil.  By special appointment I addressed at 8 P.M. a large audience of young people in the interest of edu- cation in the Kaysville Meeting house ENDENTRY home, the only available place for that purpose, is ill adapted, being too high in the ceiling, making a large echo and being too cold in winter, therefore.

Praying that Israel's God may be constantly with you and reveal unto you His Holy will concerning the welfare of His people  I remain  Your brother in the Gospel Karl G. Maeser ENDENTRY Somehow, however, Bro. Anderson has labored under the disadvantage of suceeding Bro. Isaac  Hayes, who had possessed the hearts of the Au- thorities, the pupils, and the people at large, to an unusual degree. He being different from his predecessor, and yet being measured by according to the latter's standard, my difference was charged against him, and some influential men having secretly made up their mind before hand, in spite of my protestation, to have Bro. Hayes back anyway, no matter who succeeded him—all this combined to operate against Bro. Anderson, obstacles which his own disposition was not cal- culated to remove either. Hence a very un- pleasant scene, entirely undecerved and un- called for at on the at the Boardmeeting in the afternoon took place, in consequence of which Bro. Anderson's labors as Principal of the Sevier S.A. will cease at the close of the term, and I have prom- ised to sustain Bro. Hayes as his successor, if the Board can make satisfactory arrangements with him. In company with Pres. Seegmiller drove over to Glenwood and addressed a meeting there in the evening.

Wednesday, April 16 Left Provo for Beaver via Milford and arrived at Beaver the following day at 3 P.M. meeting that evening with the Prin- cipal Daniel Book in consultation about the Academy-affairs.  Friday MarchApril 18. Spent the day in witnessing the exer- cises in the Academy, conducted entirely by Bro. Book, assisted by a Normal-student in repetition-work the classes comprised only children of the Primary Grade this last term, the higher grade having been discontinued at the close of the previous term on account of too small attendance. The Prin- cipal exercising only a general supervision over the Academy during the first and fourth term, and being actively engaged only in class work during the second and third terms. This arrange- ment is decided unsatisfactory on general principles, but must be tolerated temperarily in consideration of the surrounding circum- stances. Bro. Book was recommended by me to that Stake Board for the purpose of preparing himself for the successership as Principal, my son Reinhard desiring to resign. It is generally to the advantage of any school, if sudden change in the Principalship can be calcu- lated for such a great change. Bro. Book went to Bro.

Dear Brother, In conformity with your instructions and those of the General Board as published in the Deseret News and date of June 11, exam- inations of Church school teachers were held at Cedar, Salt Lake, and Provo at the specified times. Records of pro- ceedings have been carefully kept and are respectfully submitted in accompanying book. Results thus far obtained show, that 15 Candidates have passed ^for^ the Primary Grade, 47 for the  Intermediate Grade, and 3 as Specialists in Music.  The Board of Examiners had held several consultations pre- vious to the appointed times for examinations, to decide upon the propositions and the general mode procedure, minutes of  which deliberations have also been recorded in the book before you.  Owing to the serious illness of Bro. Benjamin Cluff jr. recently returned from Michigan University, acted, accord- ing to your instructions, as Assistant Examiner, taking spea- cial charge of the examination-exercises at Salt lake City, while Bro. I those at Gunnison, Cedar, and Provo, although attending also ENDENTRY to study hard outside of schoolhours, preparatory to his expected responsibilities. But although he has done most excellent work in the lower grade, his advancement in his studies is not yet marked enough to notify me in recommending him to the Principalship for next year, and the time of probation must be extended. The Board have sent me a petition to nominate him as Prin- cipal, he being quite popular, but mere popu- larity and efficient primary work are not the only essential qualifications of a Principal. The Beaver Stake Board of Education have in cor- porated, bought a lot in town, have the foundation laid for an Academy-building, and hope to have it ready for occupancy in the fall. The plan is good. Two story-building; seatingroom for 250  students. I suggest that all Boards of Education in the Church deposit there copy of their plans with^send^ specifications with the Secretary of the General Board.  Parawan.  Saturday, April 19. Left for Parawan, arriving there at 4 P.M. Bro. Morgan Richards entertaining me hospitably during my stay.  Sunday, April 20. Addressed Sunday school in the morning, public meeting in the afternoon, and gave an educational address in the evening.  Monday, April 231. The Bretheren at Parowan requested me last year to supply them again ENDENTRY with a districtschool teacher, as I have done for a number of years in the past. In sending them a Bro. Jensen one of last year's Graduates I hoped to have prepared the way for the establishment of a churchschool, which was our mutual aim. Although Bro. Jensen has given entire satisfaction, the people looked longingly back to Bro. Oscar  Vance, their former teacher, until now laboring as teacher in the Ogden, and Bro. Jensen himself, being a married man, desires to be nearer Sanpete, the home of his relatives. Bro. Jensen goes, but Bro. Vance does not come back as he intends to take a course of higher studies at the L.D.S. College. This arouses the breth- eren at Parowan to start at once a church school, for which I will have to find a Principal.  Cedar City  Tuesday, April 22 left for Cedar where I had to fill an appointment to address in the new beautiful Tabernacle the people in the evening.  Wednesday, April 23. spent the day during school hours the exercises at the Stake Academy, conduc- ted by the Principal Bro. Mayhew H. Dalley, Miss Sarah Higbee, Assistant and Lady-teacher, and Bro. Caslett as Music-teacher. There were a Prep- ratory and an Intermediate Department, with some advanced classes in academic studies.

This being the first experiment of the kind in our Church- school-Organization, a great many difficulties had to be over- come and much patience and persuasion to be brought into requisition in order to accomplish the object in view, namely to lay a sure foundation of efficiency in our Church- school-Service.  As the manuscript list of Percentages now before you shows several vacancies as yet it has been impossible for the Board of  Examiners to determine the Percentage of "General Efficiency." Several of the candidates were not able to attend the regular ex- aminations in consequence of which special examinations eith- er in writing or oral had to be held, involving a large am- ount of correspondence. The Board of Examiners asks here- by for instructions, whether the "General Efficiency" should be determined upon the Percentages obtained thus far, and or whether it should be left open until next year, until the Certificates be made out accordingly.  By As instructed, Bro. Benjamin Cluff jr. is now engaged to have his academic diploma as Bachelor of Mathematics and Didactics (BMD) corresponding to his diploma from the Michigan University as B.S. and will submit it to the President for signature in due time.

I have visited the Church schools at Provo, Cottonwood, 14 Ward, 18 Ward, and the L. D. S. College since the opening of the school season, met with the Seventies, Boards, and in several instances also with the people of the respective districts in public meetings. Several schools have started in August, some in September, some before Conference in October, and some intend star- ting Oct. 13 and 20. The establishment of special theological classes for children not attending church schools has been made  one of the subjects of my remarks to the people. A course of  instructions from the General Board is one of the essential requirements for this movement. In connection with  this I recommend also to the General Board the imme- diate consideration of the report of the Ladies’ Committee. In consideration of the importance of vocal instructions in our church schools, I have requested that all Lady- Normals in our Normal classes should make that branch one of their specialties. ENDENTRY is becoming affected in many instances, and a much larger continuance of the school under such conditions would incur responsibilities upon some- one, that no body should dare to assume. The exercises conducted by Bro. Nephi Savage, as Prin- cipal, Bro. Ro- seinia Jarvis, Assistant, and by two Normal-stu- dents with single classes, were exceedingly creditable. But Mrs. Jarvis as Lady-teacher, has not worked up sufficient courage to commence a course of special instructions to the lady-students, a deficiency which I hope will be overcome in the future with the help of the general instruc- tions to be published by our General Ladies Committee, for the guidance of all our Lady Teachers throughout the Organization. From among the many interesting remarks made by the Members of the Board, Stake- and Temple- Authorities present at the occasion, I only state the one as characteristic of the spirit of the whole school, viz: "That it had not be found ne- cessary to establish any special domestic regula- tions for the students outside of school, as their conduct had been conceded by all to be so that they  enjoyed the fullest confidence of Board since illegible of it is the highest testimonial that can be given to any school in point of worship Saturday April 26, addressed by spirit I invite illegible and illegible school-teacher. 4 illegible words ENDENTRY Immediately after my visits to the church schools in the  North, it will become necessary to attend the church schools at St Joseph, Arizona, that have never been visited, and are clamoring for a visit. The dis- tance I would entail ^cause^ expenses which I could not venture to in- cur without special instructions from the General Board.  The irregularity with which many of our church schools have  commenced this year’s operations have in several instances proved disadvantageous to our interests, in as much as some very efficient teachers could not afford to wait until so late in the season before the schools to which I had assigned them would open, and I had to grant them the privilege of accepting positions in district–schools. Some are asking now for teachers after all available talent has been disposed of.  Karl G. Maeser, Gen. Supt.  P. S. Some Principals complain that there are members of their respective Boards that have never taken an active part, never  attend Board–meetings, nor care for the school, or patronize it in any way.

The basement- walls were up ready for the joists, to commence the upper story.

Attended the exercises of the Academy, conducted entirely by the Principal, Bro.

Swenson has made his mark among the young people at Panguitch. He has a herculean task before him, for the cowboy-element has thus far the controlling one in the neighborhood. Horseracing, gambling, footracing andc andc on the  Sunday andc are the characteristics of the young men there, and nowhere in all my travels among the people in Zion have I seen such a looseness in manners, even in public meeting, as it showed itself there, although I was told, the young boys had been uncommonly well behaved that day. But the President of the Stake and the Bretheren of the Board stand by Bro. Swenson, and quite a number of young men have already forsaken their evil ways. There were students of the Pre- paratory and Intermediate Departments, and some of the Primary Dep, mixed, and Bro. Swen- son has his hands full among his 60 pupils. He did splendid work though.

Found the records of the Academy in fine shape. The Academy occupies three classrooms and a Principal's office in the Courthouse. The premises are convenient, but not sufficient for the large attendance during the winter. It is said that within a  short time the "State House" will be sold at auction. If so that opportunity should not be suffered to pass by in securing it, and not let- ting it go into the hands of our enemies. There is, however, ^throughout the whole Stake^ a very pronounced feeling a- gainst the ^permanent^ location of the Stake Academy at Fillmore, they prefer Holden for that end. It will require the advices of President Wood- ruff to guide the people in the solution of the problem. A Boardmeeting was held in the evening  in which it appeared, that Primary Church ENDENTRY conds up to the III Readergrade, to be conducted by some lady-teachers were badly needed in the settlements, under supervision of the Stake Boards.

Dear Brethern, When I last reported to you I was  at Zara to visit the Branch of our  church there. I found them very faithful and filled with the love  of the Gospel. They were, of course, very anxious to gather, and were  very happy in the thought that the Lord would soon open up de  liverence for them from bondage. They are not so hard up  for food as are the saints in Aintab, but they are more  in thraldom which makes life tiresome. The hope which the  Gospel gives is their life. Elder Nishan Sheriman presides. He is a faithul man and much beloved of the saints. He is also  respected of the outsiders and of the Government. The prospects there  are not flattering, a few are investigating. They were very fortu nate in not having to go through the massacre. The saints  fasted and prayed for seven days when they noticed prepa rations for slaughter and God heard their prayers and delivered the  town from destruction, for which they are very thankful.  They plad with me continually to ask the Brethern in Zion  not to forget them, that they might also be gathered to some place  where they could learn more of the ways of the Lord and  help to build up His Kingdom. A circumstance happened while at Zara which impressed me with a new idea about  traveling and preaching the Gospel in Turkey. I was for a little  while mistaken for an English Consul. From the whole af- ENDENTRY F. F.

According to instructions from Apos- tle Lund I started north emediatly after his leaving Zion.  At Beyrout I mailed him some information including a map of El gere, the villige for sale, all of which I learn by letter from him has safely reached him at Islington 42.  As he will present that part of our work I will not mention it here.  May 23rd We arrived at Allepo (Halep) And found President Maycock and Elder Larsen together with the saints well and  happy.  During the week we were envi- ted to a discussion with the Catholics ENDENTRY -fair I understood that if I were careful to notify my  Consul of my intended trip and obtained a Gen I'arme from the Government, that I could travel and stay at pleasure  without trouble. To prove this I determined on a trip to Gürüne where I knew the Government did not want any foreigners  to go if they could help it. As soon as I arrived at Sivas  I turned my pass over to my consul Dr. Jewet who trea ted me with ^consideration^. He sent it by the Dragoman to the Government  who fix it O.K. and gave me a guide. I also asked him to  inform the Kaimakam at Gürüne of my coming. When  I arrived at Gürüne I had perfect liberty, was treated with re spect by the officials and met only the opposition which our  presence always produces with the Protestants. The experiment  was a success. It was said that several were ready to be  baptized but I did not so find it. There were good people and investigators, and probably those who would have been  baptized had not the Protestants raised such a storm. Brethern, the breaking loose from this world is hard every  where, but it is harder where no political rights are en joyed. neither have we had any formal acknowledgement  from the Government so that we could offer the needed  protection. I know we say have faith in the Lord, do right  and obey the gospel and let the consequences follow. But that  is hard for them to do ^who^ have, as a rule, but little moral force  of character. Much less than a century ago they were ignorant  priest-ridden Armenians. Now the Protestants have enlightened  them alittle. They are far from possessing that courage and  stability which our fathers have transmitted to us, and which  they possessed long before we heard the Gospel, Many are  ENDENTRY in an anti chamber of the Chaldean Catholic church of Aleppo. We excepted the invitation. And for two evening we were discussing the question of athe Original Sin. Many were present and we hope much good was done, yet you know the Catholics atre, as a rule, not open to conviction. It was more remar^k^able because we were envited to a catholic Church. They suposed the victory easy, but found on the last end that the question envolved a great deal which they could not explain away. I was much troubled because I had to speak through an enterpretor.  On May 29th we had the pleasure to baptize 8 persons. Several were persons of good families.  June the first we arrived at Aintab and the following Sunday, fast day, we baptized 5 persons, One of whom is ^a^ man of some standing, his children ^are^ well educated. A- nother leading man is redy to be baptized.  The step is a great trial to them. Every effort is being made by the Protestants to hinder new members from joining. ENDENTRY honest and good, but thy need the same development  as we have to do as we do. They have not inherited the  experience, the self reliance nor the development of moral thought  and courage that we inherited from our parents, and which is in- creased and intensified in us by the knowledge of the gospel and  by the free institutions with which we are invironed.  At Gürüne Albistan about 75 miles south of there. He ^is^ what is called a Campbellite. He was  quite interested and told ^me^ of a little church in Albistan which  are seeking for truth. But his position was like the others. He  asked, are you recognized? I told him no. He urged recognition as did the others. The dominant churches over tax our people, They annoy them in numerous ways so that to step out  to begin anew takes courage. The Alepo branches  were organized before the lines were drawn so sharply. I therefore  earnestly plead with you, my Brethern, that you do all you can  for our Brothers and Sisters in GTurkey. In their present  condition they will need help continually, but if they can be  gathered out to one place they will evidently soon improve  as they are smart and apt to adopt new ideas and practices. That  you did not at once adopt our report and decide to buy the  Gire' property did not suprise me, indeed, had you done  so I should have been suprised. But it was all we could see in the short time we were investigating. We were looking more  for what we wanted, pr. instructions, than for what we could get. I am now looking for what we can get and where we can get  it. My observations will be reported promptly to you from time to time.

They site with some force the fact that we are not rec- congnized by the Government of Turkey, while this is true it is certainly no crime; still it is being worked to a good advantage which you will see by the following account of our trip north. At Aintab our land- lord has been rather dilatony about fixing up outr room according to agreement and it bothers us some, but he will probably make it right on the last end. It is not so easy to accomplish just what you want here owing to the poor mail and transpor- tation service in this land.  Then maybe he also feels this as we are not recognized we are not very dangerous. Regcogniztion au- thority or a display of power is a great thing in this land of despotism.

We do not need to go  so far, All we need to do is to brave the danger of frontier  life as we did in Utah, and we can get plenty of Good land  and water almost for nothing. Mesopotania  with its ancient water canal systems is empty and iddle. I am  told by those who know that there is not finer country in the  world, But ^it^ is well inland. Yet Uncle Sam backed by the Lord  is good enough for anybody. Since seeing what I have on this  trip my language is quite insufficient to express my gra  titude to God for America and her institutions, even aside  from what I know of the gospel. I shall, however, do nothing  except by your authority, but I have not lost hope in the  Ottoman Government giving us land on easy terms now that  we are not opposed by our own U.S. officials. They used to oppose  us now we have their assistance. I am told by Mr. Allaimby  U. S. Marshall to Turkey, that the Legation here 10 years ago went so far as to tell the Porte that we were not acknowledge as  a church at home and that they could not protect us. The Porte snubed them nicely by giving them to understand that we would  have the same recognition and protection as others. This was most  agreable news to me. The Marshall said it was on file at the  Legation and if I can secure a copy of it I will send it to you. Mr Allaimby has visited Utah, and has in his possession a letter  from President John Taylor. He offered me any needed as- sistance in his power, For which I was thankful.  Since coming to Constantinope I have labored with the  question of recognition. I move slow and I find it Benificial. Dr. Angel, the Minister received me kindly but left at once  ENDENTRY After encouraging the saints to faith- fulness at Aintab and having arranged all matters as best we could we left Presi- dent Maycock and the Saints June the 7th for Shusni Mansur whence we had re- ceived a number of pressing invitations to come and baptize etc. Our caravan being a large one we had no police or soldier with us. In four days we arrived safely and found that the whole town was in one stir about us and our coming. The wildest rumors about our giving many wives and much money to all who would join had deceived many who had such bugs in their brains. Could we have complied with their wish we could have done great business. But when they found our business of a quite different nature, that we required faith and works, that we received from members, tithing etc, and did not give the whole thing flatened with that crowd. In the mean time we had been visited by the police, my teskere (pass) and books had been taken to the police station, and a charge or suspicion had been trumped up by the ENDENTRY (second sheet)  for the United States. The Charge d'Affaires, Mr John Riddle has assited me very willingly. He at once sent  a dragoman to the Government ^to find out^ how to proceed in this  matter, and finally we were refered to the Minister of Religions,  Mr. me from former visits. He explained  to us that it was nessesary first to send the petition to Alepo and  have it signed by the native Elders of our Church, then to the  Vali who would investigate if we had a people there and certify  to the findings. Then the petition would come here and be  considered by the sublime Porte. This government could not recogni- ze us as we are foreigners but it would consider a petition from its own citizens. He promised his assistance. He has read and  formally excepted the petition with a slight correction and it is  now ready to sent to Sivas and Alepo. Please find a copy with this report in seperate envelope marked A.  Just at the time of getting up this petition I was in a little trouble how to begin and where to get assistance. Mr. Riddle pre sented me with a ticket to go to Sultan  drive to the Hamidiea Mosque to prayer. I attended and upon  my return I was hailed by Brother Binyad, our Greek brother and  a sort of lawyer by profession. We were so pleased to meet. After  investigating his condition I sent him to find out from some  high officials all he could of how we should proceed and he re turned a report identical with Ziver Bey's advise. He at once  struck up a plan or form which was excepted as above stated. Ziver Bey and the Legation people promised such aid as we would  need when the petition comes back. And Mr. Garqiula the  Legation enterpreters presence upon each visit gave a great deal of force to my position. ENDENTRY Protestants and the Government to gather that we were agitators.

They chose to send us at once and in a short time we were sent out of town, a horse back at our own expence, under two gaurds to Malatia, Of course we suffered a great deal of indignity from a worldly standpoint but we were happy. Brother Nishan proved a great healp to me as he was used to such indignities has advise had a good effect. My obstainasy saved us from further trouble and in two days, we i. e. part of three days travel we were at Malatia. The road, or trail, was of the roughest I ever traveled and still entitlled to the name of ENDENTRY As these men at the Legation and General Consulate would not take any backshish for services, I offered them a  Book of Mormon as a present from the Church. They seemed  very much gratified with the proposition and would except the  books with thanks. I have therefore ordered a Book of Mor mon for Mr. Garqiula and a Voice of Warning for Mr. Dimitri  adus of the General Consulate, from Bern as they desire French. I hope you will approve of this as it is an easy, and may be a  benificial way to remember them and to show our appricia- tion of their assistence which we may need much more  in the future. The cash expences of the petition will be about five^eight^ Dollars.  I called on Mr. Turkey. He re ceived me very cordially and answered my questions without reserve. He said that America had better treaty rights with turkey than  any other nation, and that we were perfectly secure in property holding  in Turkey, that is, said he, as secure as ^a^ governmeent like this can  make it. He said the Turkish Government lived up to the treaty  better than the Americans, and that he was sorry that there were some  Americans who seem to think it an honor if they could defy the  Turks or say something to offend them under the Juristection  of the U.S. Government. Mr. Dimitriadus, the vice Consul and  sec. of the Consulate has furnished me a copy of the protocal and  enterpretation of our priviledges relating to property rights, and secu rity from interference by Turkish officials. The copy is also  made part of this report and is marked B.  I would ask these questions. Is the gathering limited  to Palestine? And further, Shall I look toward a petition to the  Porte for land for our saints if we are successful with the  petition for recognition? ENDENTRY malil route. Over mountain passes, down washout's, crossing several ranges the trail being many places very dangerous. At Malatia we were soon released, or told there was no change. We were told we were not arrested but that as the road was un safe (also true) we were only gaurded from the robbers etc. This was a cute explaina- tion. My pass and books had been seized and sent here under double seal. I gave them to understand I quite knew the difference between arrest and liberty. It was clear that we were not entirely free as the Mu- tesarif desierd we should lodge in the barracks telling us it was better that the filthy khan. I thanked him but told him if I was free I would go to the khan a little discussion issued between themselves, and the police commissioner, who proved to be a gentlemen, came and told us we might go to the Khan. They evidently were figuring on some plan to let us go, which is not the easiest thing in the world in this land were no one seems to know just what to do es- pecially in cases envolving foreignors. ENDENTRY I ask these questions now that I may receive an answer  in time to continue my labors when I come back to  Pa lestine to see the Gire' property and Palestine in Sept. according  to the instructions from Apostle Lund. Afterwards I will go north  to Alepo to help the petition work there. And if you think  proper I will investigate chances for land in Northern  Syria. As for the natives I see no more to fear from them than we had to fear from the Indians in Utah. There are dif ficulties but they can be overcome by the Lord's assistance. Go where we will and we shall find difficulties to surmount  but if we begin right by sending enough foreigners to our  place of settlement to beget confidence and ^to^ establish respect and  confidence in the movement we will soon be alright. A foreign hat is a great power in Turkey.  A friend and investigator Mr. Negro, a Polish Gentlemen of fine education and attainments came here as an exile from Poland. He is now a Turkish subject and has worked for years for them as an ingeneer. He also states that there is plenty  of land to be had in Syria and that good tittles can be had. A  little backshish is needed. Then let a man who is a citizen  and in whom we have confidence buy and imidiately trans fer to an American. He has extensive experience in land  matters. I became aquainted with him 10 years ago and he seems  like and exceedingly good man.  In regard to the mission in General I believe  it is progressing favorably. The probability of a place  of gathering gave a good deal of new life and energy as  it does in all countries. This is natural to the Gospel. ENDENTRY We left the barracks, however, and went to the Khan were we found to our surprise that we had a guard placed over us. I at once sent a nother soldier to notify the government that I positively objected to any such indignity. The soldier was prompt- ly removed. It was some time before we could decide washat was coming next. But it soon dawned on us that the Mustesarif had telegraphed the Govenorrnor at Kharpoot for instructions. The Vali telegraphed back that in as much as we were desirous of going to Sivas not to hinder us, but to give me back my books, and examine any Armenian papers found. This was com- plied with. Our Armenian writings were endorsed O. K. by the Commissionor. So far so good, but it was not until two days out from Malatia that we were noright sure that we were not in some un- derhanded way being sent to Sivas. But one of the Gen I'arneo hwho ackcompanied us was induced to show us his papers by speaking of the general method of protecting travelors. This was a great relief to us. As I was all the ENDENTRY New hopes have been engendered by this prospects of the  realization of the promises to the House of Israel.  I have  not heard whether or not Brothers Vizirian and Nadjarian  have been released from prison, but they are reported as  bearing faithful testamonies in their cell in Diarbekr and  they have found believers, Those men are very energetic.  I would reco^m^mend that one or two more experienced  Elders be sent here. And that each Utah Elder traveling  has a native Brother as his assistance. The native Bro- ther to act as interpretor, He can do the preaching, as a rule, better than we. It also helps to put the Utah Elder in good stan ding before the Government and people. The actual expence of  keeping a native Elder is not much. And alone the native  can do nothing. The situation has entirely changed since  the massacre. Natives are under restrictions all the time and  are not safe from arrest unless in the imploy of some  foreignor. And Foreingners must put themselfves in a position  to hold the respect of the people by the dignity and authority which  our treaties and consular aid affords, otherwise we are  liable to arrest and much trouble. We hope this condition  will soon change but until then we must proceed in  some such way to preach the Gospel in Turkey. Turkey  is a peculiar country with peculiar laws and customs, and  very strange ways of inforcing them as few persons under  stand the laws. But if they think you are in Good standing in Stamboul or well backed by your own Government they  look upon you as Lords. And it is very profitable and convenient  to have them continue to think so. A show of superiority seems  necessary. The people here must look up to some authority  ENDENTRY time more anxious about Bro Nishan than about myself. Sivas was a U. S. Consul who would protect one while if Bro. Nishan should be taken from me in anyway it m^i^g^ht^ prove a heaard case for  him, besides hurting his enfluence at Zara, his home, where hise is the leading Christian citizen. We are thankful that God delivered us and that at this writing we ^have^ passed police examination and all is well. It is awful to think that men whose acts are strickly honest and whose conscience is clear and who try earnestly to comply with the law of the land shall still fear and tremble at meeting and officer lest something unfore- seen shall turn up and one be mistrusted. At Husni Masur a good and faithful testomony was left to hundreds. At Ma- latia only little was done beyound destributing track. We felt that our liberty depended largely upon our leaving town soon so we left at once otherwise we would have been sent to Kharpoot the  Governor's seat and of the case had been augmented from there to Constantinople. The lower officers at Husni ENDENTRY Mansur tryed hard to fix suspicion on my journal. This they could not read and it came back unread. While it is free from any thing obnoxious to the Ottoman Government Yet it contains much important matter pertaining to our special mission which might for a while have put me in ^a^ wrong light and done us injury. but all is now well. This trap was set by the College people at Lund will tell you. they have notified their preachers near and narefar of our intentions of visiting their cities. They have been instructed to notify the city authorities that we are sedicious and un- recognized therefore have not rights. Theis was a smart trick. We have been told the whole scene by Army officers and  others who deplored our fate but could not help us. Now that it is over it is clear to me that the time is ripe for an ap- plication to become recognized. This ex- perience wisely used will furnish an excelent-opening wedge. Not as a complaint but as a reason to our Minister at Con- stantinople to whom I hold a special ENDENTRY (third sheet)  in man which they themselves do not possess. When they see a superiority then they are humble and submissive. This is their education for centuaries, with them it is second  nature. If we try to be their equals, as the Gospel teaches, and as we  would naturally like to be, we destroy our influence, To the mem bers we may be what the Gospel teaches, but to the others we must  appear above.  I thank you for the appropriation fo  the schools in Zara a young sister is instructing the  children of the saints and it works very well. I have not  heard ^what^ is being done at Aintab aboout the school. Bread has gone up at Constantinope and it is possi ble our Saints at Aintab will have to be assisted as  they will undoubtedly be short of food when winter comes. Work is so poor that it seems at best as though it would  keep no one. They manage, however, if they can only find  work. I think the saints in Livas and Zara will not suffer. The crops are good there, bread is cheap and work better than  at Aintab. The saints at Haifa continue the same. Sister Hilt continues unwell I am sorry to say. She is the  soul of that branch.  Personally I am well as I believe President  Larsen are. Individually I feel well in the  Gospel and take great pleasure in my labors. Yet I confess that the trial to leave home and family has been much  greater this time than ever before. And then I feel a  great responsibility connected with this whole mis sion. So long as I had the pleasant copmpany and advise of  Apostle Lund I was all right but now I feel lost often ENDENTRY in these ever changing conditions.  In conclusion I would ask you kindly to  write me a few lines to Arminag. That I may know your wish about some of these  important questions.

Dear Brother,  In compliance with your isntructions concerning my educational tour to the church schools in Arizona, I have written to the each of the Presidents of Snow- flake, St. Joseph, and Maricopa Stakes, placing myself at their disposal during the time of my stay in their respective Stakes to fill any appointments they should deem proper to make for me in the interest of our church schools, Religion Classes, Sunday schools, and M. I. Associations.  The program of this tour is as follows:  Wednesday, November 18.  Start from Provo to Holbrook November 18—21.  Railroad from Provo to Holbrook. November 21—24.  Snowflake.

The first is at Escalante, Gar- field County, for which, by request, I have nom- inated this day Bro. Martin I. Bushman, a Normal of the West Jordan, Salt Lake Co. As I have not yet been officially notified by that Local Board, but only by Counsellor Jos. E. Taylor in private conversation, I cannot make a definite appoint- ment, but have selected in my mind Bro. Bloomington, Idaho.  Bro. Hart was until recently a teacher on the Bear Lake Stake Ac- ademy, Paris, but had to discontinue with the other teachers, except the Principal, on account of the financial embarrassment of that in- stitution.  Ever praying for the blessings of the Lord to rest upon you, I remain With kind regards, Your brother in the Gospel, Karl G. Maeser ENDENTRY Provo, September 12th 1891  President Wilford Woodruff.  Dear Brother,  Bro. me after explaining to me your approval of the plan of having ^gotten up^ a series of textbooks for the three grades of religions instructions in our Churchschools, Sundayschools, Primaries et. et. When Bro. Talmage first sugges- ted this idea to me, I saw at once the great benefits that would probably be derived from such a step, in as much as I have realized for a long time the want of a religious textbook constructed upon correct Normal principles. Hence my enthusiastic endorsement of the Sunday school Leaflets, the first real step in that direction. With great joy I learned, therefore, of your approval of Bro. Talmage's plan, which he had laid before you upon my suggestion. Considering also the many difficulties which the introduction of the Religion-Classes is encountering in some Stakes, among which the want of proper methods is the most promin- ent, the publishing of suitable textbooks would remove many objections that have been raised against this wise move of the First Presidency. The Religious Classes is a supplement ^and effect^ to the secularisation of  our district-schools have become a necessity in  ENDENTRY those Stakes of Zion, or Bishop's Wards, where the schools are in the hands of the opponents to the Latterday Work, and where Sunday schools and  Primaries, can with these new textbooks as guides, would prove too feeble bulwarks against the flood- of evil influences bearing down upon our children during the whole working school directed by in many cases professionally efficient teachers ^but opposed to our faith^. In some Stakes also noble work has already been done in those Religion-Classes, promising a further de- velopment, especially when assisted by those books in contemplation, the results of which cannot be measured by human calculation.  The question of authorship appears to me very simple as for the qualification is concerned, in as much as we have no educational author thus far among as equal to Dr. James E. Talmage. If he shall find time for this work depends en- tirely upon the direction of the First Presidency. I shall take great pleasure in rendering all possible assistance in this work, but Bro. Talmage ought to be the man to do it.  I have looked over with Bro. Talmage the manu- script for Gen. Circ. No. 7, and approve fully of his suggestions.  Bro. Woodbury has been recalled to Farmington and will see that your daughter Mary gets there also. He staid with me here yesterday.  With kind regards, Your brother in the Gospel,  Karl G. Maeser. ENDENTRY Provo City, April 13. 1891  President Wilford Woodruff.  Dear Brother,  In conversations held separately with Bros. Howard and Larson of Emery Stake, during Conference, and by letters from Bro. Eli A. Day, Principal of their Stake Academy, I discovered such a hopeless case of disunion existing in the Stake Board of Education, that steps leading to an improvement in this state of affairs become imperative. Both Principals, the one of the Stake Academy at Castle Dale, and the other of the Seminary at Huntington are completely discouraged. The latter has quit already and has gone home, and the former wants to quit at the end of this term, and intends to attend^ the Normal Course at the B.Y. Academy for a term or two, if he shall get a chance.  He has been arrested again during Confer- ence on the ongoing charge, having served already a term in the pen.  It appears from all that I can learn, that the old jealousy between Huntington and Castle Dale, especially on the part of the former place, led by Bros. Howard and Johnson, is handicapping all the operations of the Stake Board, of which Bro. Howard is the nominal President. Bro. Larsen, the Stake President, being no member of the Board at all on account of some mistaken modesty of his.  ENDENTRY As this is a matter concerning Board affairs I have no authority to give instructions, but report the case to you. Counselor Seely implored me to see that something be done, and I promised him that I would lay this case before for you, so that relief from this strained condition of affairs could be obtained.

ENDENTRY Provo City, January 19th 1892  President Wilford Woodruff  Dear Brother,  At an official visit Brigham Young Academy, taking notes, attending the recitations of the teachers, and meeting with the Faculty after school in special session, of which proceedings I shall make due report to you in connection with my report of my southern circuit commencing with today—I found that all the teachers of the Brigham Young Academy, teaching academic studies, are using officially the title "Professor" on the bulletin-boards and elsewhere in the Academy. As this is against the rule adopted by the General Board of Education, laid down in General Circular No. 7, page 5, I objected to this at the Faculty- meeting. None of these teachers, except Professor Cluff, who has his Diploma, holds even a License for these academic studies. Several of them have handed to me last night their applications for Licenses in their re- spective academic studies, endorsed by Prof. Cluff as Principal. I have filled out blanks accordingly and submit them herewith respectfully for your con- sideration. These teachers solicit the permission of  ENDENTRY the General Board to use the title "Professor" on the strength of these Licenses, as they are ready to pass their examination for the "Academic Degree" next spring.  According to your instructions to submit my opinion on all pending questions in Church School matters, I venture to state, that this question does not concern the teachers of the Brigham Young Academy alone, but can be applied to the Colleges at Salt  Lake and Logan as well. The granting of the request of the B.Y.A. teachers would necessitate, therefore, some modification of the paragraph in the Gen. Circ. No. 7, above alluded to.  I shall return from Provo, Friday, Jan. 29th, when I should be pleased to receive any instructions from you on this point, or can call on you any day between January 30 and February 1st.  With kind regards Your brother in the Gospel, Karl G. Maeser ENDENTRY Provo City, April 2nd 189  President Wilford Woodruff.

ENDENTRY Provo City, March 2d 1892  President Wilford Woodruff.  Dear Brother,  According to program submitted in my letter to Bro. Reynolds, January 15, I have visited in the interest of our Church School Organization the Stakes of Sanpete, and  Sevier from January 19 until February 26; attended during that  period the Stake Academies at Castle Dale, Hunting- ton, Gunnison, spending in each of these schools  one whole day, from the opening exercises in the morning  until the closing exercises in the afternoon; taking notes,  examining the the records required in Gen. Circ. No 7, page 17; met with the respective Faculties for consultation; and met  also with the Stake and the Local Boards to ascertain the  condition of their general affairs.  Appointments by the  Stake Superindendents for me to address public meetings  were made at Nephi, Fillmore, Deseret,  Orangeville, Ephraim, Manti, Gunnison, and Richfield, at all of which  occasion our Church Schools and Religion Classes were the leading subjects; Sunday Schools, Primaries, and Mutual Improvement Associations, as corroborate institutions, re- ENDENTRY III Students.  Students in attendance at our Church schools during the first half of the present scholastic year have been registered  a; according to Sex as  2091 Males and 1728 Females = Total 3819.  b; according to Grade:  in the Normal Departments: 186  in the Academic Departments: 280  in the Intermediate Departments: 1857  in the Preparatory Departments: 807  in the Primary Departments:  689 = Total 3819.  Four Church schools, however, have not yet reported, but their atten- dance according to insidental information would aggregate about 550, which would make our whole attendance until January 1st about 4369.  It will be seen from these Statistics that the introduc- tion of the Freeschool System in our District Schools has not materially ^interfered^ with our attendance.  IV.  Studies.  Our Church schools have conducted thus far following number of classes, viz: in Theology 81; in Rhiteric 6; in Grammar and Composition 127; in Elocution 7; in Reading 139; in Orthography 48; in Arithmetic 171; in Algebra 14; in Geometry 4; in Trigono- metry 2; in Phonography 1; in Bookkeeping 29; in Astronomy 1; in Geology 2; in Phys- ical Geography 16; in Standard Geography 82; in Physics 3; in Chemistry 4; in Physiology 30; in Hygiene 43; in Natural History 11; in Biology 2; in Civil Government 5; in General History 7; in U.

The school's, without one exception, have been better patronized than the previous year and a marked  progress toward permanency is observable in all of  them.  The only drawback is the financial embarrass- ment under which some of them are laboring yet. There is one feature, however, to which I take the liber- ty of calling the attention of the General Board for  the earliest possible consideration viz:  The annual change  of Principals in many of our Church Schools, in con- sequence of which such schools can never ^hope to^ emerge out  of the experimental stage and to reach a leading po- sition ahead of the District Schools at least not to  a very pronounced degree.  The main reason is the  comparatively poor salary, and the absence of any pro- spective improvement in this regard, forcing us to  supply these schools every year or so with new be- ginners, as their predecessors are compelled to seek  for better chances elsewhere.  A proposition has  suggested itself to my mind which, if it can be car- ried out, might circumvent this difficulty.  I should  suggest an addition to any Principal's salary after five  years' service in one school, and so on after every five years more until a stipulated maximum should be reached.

Dear Brother,  In as much as the time for our Annual Church School Convention is near at hand, it becomes my duty to submit to you a few suggestions for your consideration to instruct members of the General Board present at the occasion to bring what extent they might bring before the Convention any or all of them, or other points of importance which you may desire to have them speak upon.  1. It has been noticed with regret that several Church Schools have not yet made arrangements that the copies of the Juvenile Instructor, containing the "Church School Papers", are kept on file for reference, in consequence of which omis- sion many of our Church School Teachers are kept in ignorance of this content.  2. As the Religion-Classes are an appendage to our Church School Organization, and as such are under the control of the respective Stake Boards of Educa- tion, and the Principal of the Stake Academy, whereas practicable, should act as Stake Superintendent over these classes, but the majority of our Religion-Class- Instructors are not professional teachers, all our ENDENTRY continued  Woodruff would kindly permit the Mae- ser's name for next year as Principal, and that Pres. Smoot be re- quested to secure the services of Bro. Geo. Brimhall, Principal of the Provo District Schools, as teacher for the Normal Department. With these arrangements being granted, they were willing to labor on at any sacrifice for the sake of bridging over the trying position into which their dear Academy were just now placed.  They all have received their training, spiritual and mental, in the Academy, and owed this debt of gratitude to her.  There was much emotion exhibited in that meeting.  Last night I had a private interview with Pres. Smoot at his residence, by appointment.  By representing to him the fact that the B. Y. Academy had passed through many and severe struggles, among which the ordeal of fire was not the least, and had been gaining in spite of all that in influence and usefulness, and had manifestly enjoyed the approval of the Lord and His Servants, she would continue to hold her own as long her Board and Faculty would keep in the line of the Spirit of the Gospel. I told Bro. Smoot that the First Presidency were loyal to the B. Y. Academy, and that, in establishing a much needed Univer- sity at Salt Lake, for the purpose of eventually stopping that pernicious annual exodus of our young people to  Eastern ENDENTRY regular Church-School-Teachers should render us all possible assistance in the further development of that great work.  3. It is very desirable that a report of the complete or- ganization of these Religion Classes should be received from every stake of Zion on or before Sept. 15.  4. Many of our "District-Conventions" have passed through the experimental stage, and are in good working order. Several Branch Conventions have been organized for the greater convenience of far off members, and promise to become soon independent District-Conventions. As the office of Chairman of Convention has been found to develop into one of great responsibility, it is thought best that the General Board should reserve ^to itself^ the nominations for that office.  5. Attention is called on it more to the instructions given in our General Circulars that no branches of studies should be announced in Church School Annuals, was placed into the Curriculum, for which there is not ^properly^ licensed or certificated teacher in that school. This rule applies also to Normal Classes in Stake Academies.  6. The unprecedented development of our Church Schools Organization recalls to mind the ia discussion in the General Board of Education preceding the issuance of one of the General Circulars, when it was understood ENDENTRY High Schools, it was not intended to interfere in the least with the  noble mission which the B. Y. Academy was performing. The First Presidency had called away, it is true, thus far the leading teachers from the Academy, but simply for the reason that there had been no others available at the time, and not for the reason of keeping down the Academy. Bro. Smoot feels some what more encouraged, and instructed Brimhall for the purpose above alluded to.  In connection with this B. Y. Academy affair, I beg leave to call your attention also to the JM. Tanner has an- nounced his intention to go East after the close of the schoolyear, and study also for a year or two as Bros. Cluff have done in order "to be even with them". Now, there is the Agricultural College at Logan with its financial advantages gaining influence and power in ever increasing ratio. The B. Y. College  must not be suffered to be swamped by that Gentile Institution, which it certainly would be, if Bro. Tanner, who has been working up a fine spirit among the young people there, leaves and no suitable man to continue the work. Suitable is only one that comes with an already established reputation. There are hundreds of young mean in Israel that will be in a short time just as good and probably better than any ofthe present known Educators among the Latterday Saints, but they have to make their reputation first. I have no one to suggest as suitable to carry on the work, if Bro. Tanner should leave this year. If you could induce Bro. Tanner to stay one more year the difficulty ENDENTRY continued  by the members present that it would take about five years before our contemplated standard of efficiency could be reached. Two of these five years have now passed, and although much has been accomplished, a by far greater work is yet bifore us to attend to. Among the many problems awaiting solution is the one that requires all desirous of occupying the high responsibility of Principal of a Stake Academy to hold the "Academic Degree." It is to be hoped that this point can be reached within the remaining three years.  7. The permanency of the position of Principal is another point of vital importance, the attainment of which no Board of Education can afford to lose sight of. Not only is the annual change in the Principalship deterimental to the best interests of the school in the special instances, but ^also^ has a tendency of lowering the startndard of the whole profession, in not giving security to talented persons for permanent homes and for the creation of personal influences for golasting good in any given locality.  8. Fully realizing the financial difficulties the most of our Boards of Education have to contend with, ENDENTRY continued  may ^be^ successfully met.  A very similar case presents itself at the Millard Stake Acad- emy, I. N. Hinckley has obtained from Governor Thomas the use of the "State House" at Fillmore, and is now engaged with his Brothern to secure the building for a long term of years by a well fortified Lease. This move will require some extra financial ex- ertion on the part of the Saints in that Stake, but just at this junc- ture, Bro. Josiah Hickman, the Principal of the Stake Academy, intends to resign for the purpose of taking a higher course at the L.D.S. College. I bound myself by my word to him last year, not to raise any objec- tion to his leaving this year, if he would hold on another year, as I had no suitable successor then, Bro. Hickman having done a splendid work down there and became the idol as it were of his Board, Students, and the People. That makes it very difficult for any one to follow after such a man, for everything he does or say will be measured by the standard of his predecessor. Pres. Hinckley requested me to use my influence with Bro. Hickman to remain an- other year until the S. Academy should be fairly started in the new building. As my word had been given to the contrary, I could not do so, but Bro. Hickman will abide by your counsel in the matter. He will call on you on the subject.  There is a great deal of diffidence on the part of several ENDENTRY the General Board, nevertheless, can not urge earnestly enough the necessity of having the services of every Prin- cipal at least secured for the whole schoolyear, that is 40 weeks. For, if this cannot be done, we will be beaten in the long run. The District School Services is only too anxious to secure our best teachers by offers of pecuniary remuneration exceeding ours by far, and asking for less efficiency. We would only educate teachers practically for two or three years, in order to turn them over as experienced teachers into the District School Service. Teachers cannot be asked to labor always on missionary rates, or fill out the balances of the year with other occupations to make both ends meet.  9. It is very desireable that the Stake Presidents should be presiding over the Stake Boards of Educations whenever practicable, and that noone ^member^ should continue his membership in such a Board that is not willing to put forth his energies for the advancement of the respective school.  10. It has come to the notice of the General Board that the interests of our educational movement are greatly interfered with in some Stakes by local jealousies. Wherever this spirit has shown itself it has proven itself antagonistic to the true interest in Zion.  11. There is no Stake Board of Education in Cache Stake of Zion. The Board of Trustees of the B. Y. College at  ENDENTRY Stake Presidents in regard to the introduction of these "Religion Classes", and one, President Smith of Davis Stake, told me at Farmington during the meeting, Sunday afternoon, that they did not need these classes in Davis Stake.  Questions have been asked me from many sides, if these Instructors in the Religion Classes, should not be set apart for their mission by their Bishopric? Although I am of the opinion that they should be, I had no authority to give such instruction. If this should be your mind, please to instruct me accordingly, that I could put it into the next "Church School Papers."  With kind regards, Your brother in the Gospel, Karl G. Maeser ENDENTRY continued  Logan is composed in its majority of Brethren not be- longing to the Stake, I understand. As the Religion-Classes are under the direction of a "Stake Board of Education" some provision should be made in this regard.  12. As the Principals of the Stake Academies at Brigham City, ^and^ Ephraim, and also hold no Academic Diplomas as yet, but these Academics have appropriations for Junior Normal Classes, in what moment can these Principals be authorized to teach those classes? This point needs some adjustment in order to bring it in harmony with our general instructions.  13. Bros. Hickman in  Fillmore have also carried on for several years quite successfully some normal instructions, and raised a number of good district-school-teachers. It would prove almost disastrous to these two insti- tutions to discontinue that work for the future. No provisions for the examination in a course in Pedagogy have been made as yet, pending the instructions on the subject by the General Board in the revised edition of the General Circulars. What is to be done in these two cases for the time being ENDENTRY
