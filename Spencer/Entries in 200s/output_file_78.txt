I regretvery much the financial condition inwhich I am placed makes it almost if notquite imposible for me to go this Spring, I having invested all the means I canmuster in an interprise that demandsmy personal attention, for should I leaveat preasent my business would have to be runbyastranger and should any disaster befallthe busniess I would be financially ruinedI a not only this my elth as not been the bestbeing subgect to piles. I am in the meat packingbusness, I have no disposition whatever 
 ture to you but there are meny things to takeplace that I cannot write in my opinion. I ambut a poor scritbe and my health is not good andhas not been since I suffered so much in tryingto escape the wrath of our enemies in the timeof our persecution traveling and working with wetand cold feet for 6 weeks in the breaking up of winterwas finely settled here. since my heathh has been poor.And now, I would ask if it is proper and you thinkme worthy if you are willing to rermber me in your crircle as you pray in the temple that I may gainmy helth for I should be glad to live a while yetif the Lord and my brethren were willing for whenour bodies die they go down to silence and the spiritof those who have ben baptised go to a place of rest whereI suppose there is no laber, and to be deprived of laberit must seem like a prison to me, and I wish forthat reason to serve the Lord a little longer in theflesh. I am only 78 y[ear]s old since the 28th day of AugustI have have kept the word of wisdom since 1859,and my blessing received from Patrarch John youngpromises me to live to be gathered up to Zion the center

 THE DESERET WEEKLY.Truth and Liberty.No. 7 SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH, FEBRUARY 3, 1894. Vol. XLVIII.THE POWER OF FAITH.Discourse Delivered at the Sixty-fourthSemi-Annual Conference, of theChurch, in the Tabernacle, Salt LakeCity, Sunday Afternoon, October8th, 1893, byPREST. WILFORD WOODRUFF.REPORTED BY ARTHUR WINTERI have never attended a conference since I have been a member of this Church—now nearly sixty years—at which I have refused, when called upon by the proper authority and the Spirit of God, to speak and to bear my testi-mony according to the light that I had in me, and I disliked to pass over this conference without saying something. I have been in poor condition for public speaking, having had a severe cold upon my lungs during the past week, which has prevented me from doing almost any kind of business.I have been deeply interested in the testimonies of the servants of God who have addressed us during this confer-ence. They have laid before us many great truths. My mind rests upon the subject of faith. Faith is the first prin-ciple of the Gospel. What is faith? Paul, in writing to the Hebrews, under-takes to explain it He says that "faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen;" and to prove this he goes on to tell what dif-ferent men accomplished through faith.(See xi chap. of Hebrews). I look upon faith as one of the most important prin-ciples that God ever revealed to man. Here we have four temples in these mountains, and hundreds of people are laboring in them. Who for? Both for the living and the dead. Why do they labor for the dead? Have they ever seen the resurrection of the dead? No, except by vision or revelation. But they have faith in it, and as an evidence of that faith they perform this work. They look forward to the resurrection and eternal judgment, to the celestial kingdom and the great blessings which God has revealed for the salvation and exaltation of the children of men. They do this by faith, and it is by this power that they have accomplished what they have during the last sixty years. By faith this tabernacle has been built, these temples have been reared, and these people have been gathered from the nations of the earth.  Thousands of Elders have been called, not from col-leges, but from the various occupations of life, and sent forth into the world to preach the Gospel without money and without price. Now for many years they have gone forth and preached this Gospel. Men have listened to them,and some spirit or power has convinced them that the testimony which these Elders have borne was true. These humble men of God have gone forth and said: "The fullness of the ever-lasting Gospel has been revealed by the administration of angels; the Lord has raised up prophets and inspired men; He has organized the Church on the earth as it was in the days of Jesus Christ and the Apostles; we have brought you this Gospel; hearken to it, and we promise you, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, if you will receive our testimony, repent of your sins, go down into the water and be baptized for the remission of your sins, you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, that shall bear record and witness unto you that what we say is true." What has been the result of this? Thousands have believed that testimony and proved that it was true. These Elders labored by faith; they traveled by faith; they worked by faith. It was faith that sustained them all the way through. They trav-eled without purse and scrip, and through their faith the God of heaven fed and clothed them, and opened the way be-fore them. This has been the case now for sixty years. And many people be-lieved the testimony of these simple men. They repented of their sins, were baptized for the remission of them, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost; they received that Holy Ghost, and it bore testimony to them of the truths of the Gospel.Brethren and sisters, it is by faith that you are here today, gathered from the nations of the earth. By that power you have been sustained, until you have ac-complished these things that are now before you in your history. We ought to look at these things as they are. We ought to have faith, not only in what is past but in what is to come. It is by faith that we look forward to the resur-rection of the dead. Our forefathers are in the spirit world. They died without the Gospel. They never saw the face of a prophet or an apostle. They laid down their bodies, and their spirits went into the spirit world. There they have listened to the Gospel of Christ. Jesus taught the Gospel in the spirit world while His body lay in the tomb. Joseph Smith, Hyrum Smith and those Elders of Israel who have been martyred and who have died for the word of God and testimony of Jesus have gone to preach this Gospel there. Spirits in prison have received their testimony. The prison doors have been opened. These spirits will come forth in the morning of the resurrection, and they will receive these blessings and glories, the same as if they had heard and received the Gospel in the flesh. And these Latter-day Saints have built these temples and gone towork in them with just as much assur-ance of the truth of these things as though it had been sounded in their ears by the trump of the archangel of God. They have had this faith, and they will not be disappointed.That is the condition the Latter-day Saints are in today. As to opposition, we may expect that, because the arch-enemy has labored against the work of God in all ages of the world. But we have reason to rejoice and to be thank-ful to our Heavenly Father that we are as well as we are today before Him. I want the Latter-day Saints to bear in mind that the ancient patriarchs and prophets spoke as they were moved upon by the Holy Ghost, and they spoke the truth. The Lord has said just what He meant, and meant what He said. The word of the Lord will never fall un-fulfilled. If you want to know what is coming to pass, read the revelations of God in the Bible, in the Book of Mormon and in the Book of Doctrine and Cove-nants. The revelations of the Lord through the Prophet Joseph Smith are glorious revelations. What the Lord promised in the commencement of this work has been fulfilled to the very letter up to the present. So it will continue. We should lay these things to heart.There has been a good deal said with regard to our temporal affairs. That is all right. What the brethren have said concerning our temporal condition is of importance to us. I still am of the opinion that inasmuch as Zion is going to be built up on the earth, it is the mind and will of God that we should do something for ourselves. We ought to cultivate the earth. We ought not to wait for the world to come and plant and dig our potatoes, or plant and harvest our wheat, or to build railroads and carry them on. The Presidency of the Church have shouldered a very heavy load connected with this sugar factory. Why should we not make sugar? Utah sends a very great amount every year out of the Territory for sugar. This should not be. The soil is here and the talent is here to raise beets and to make sugar. Why should not the Latter-day Saints do this and keep their money at home? Is there any sin in this? Not at all; the more of these things we would do, the better, I think, the Lord would be pleas-ed with us. I know there has been quite a feeling one way or another, be-cause we have burdened ourselves with these labors. But it is our duty to try to get the Latter-day Saints to cultivate the earth and to produce what they eat and drink and what they wear. We have tried to do this. It is true, it cost a great deal to establish the sugar plant, and the Church had to shoulder a great measure of responsibility in connection with it,

 This Elder is called to Oregon but can easily bechanged to the Northern States if you think wellto do so. G. R.Ephriam Mar. 12, 1898.President Wilford Woodruff.Dear Brother.Your letter announcingme as a missionary wasduly received. I thankthe Lord that I have beenworthy of being called as Hisservant and trust that I m[a]y prove myself worthyto be His servant.Although the field appointedme was somewhat surprisingI am willing to go andtry to do the best that I can. I had somewhatcherished the hope of seeingmy relatives in Chicagoand laboring a short timewith them, who are at 
 in order to carry it out. I do not think we have done wrong in that. When I go before my Father in heaven I am willing to bear my part of the respon-sibility, because if there is anything on earth that I was ever moved upon by the Spirit to do it was to unite in that enter-prise with my brethren. I believe it is our duty to manufacture what we use, as far as we can, at home. We refer to these temporal things because they are and always will be connected with us.I feel to rejoice myself that we are as well off as we are. There has never been a period when we have been any better off than we are today. I look back to the days when we came here. We found a barren desert. The man that led us here was Brigham Young. He was a prophet, seer and revelator. He was never destitute of revelation from the day that I first knew him until his body was laid in the tomb. He was a great man—a man of God. We see the result of his work here. He was our architect, so to speak. He fulfilled his mission in a great and wonderful manner, and when he laid his body down he went to mingle with his breth-ren and the Gods.The Gospel of Christ is true. The Zion of God is true. We are here in fulfilment of the revelations and visions of the ancient patriarchs and prophets. Read Isaiah, Jeremiah and the other prophets, and see what they said. We came here by the revelations of God. Many of the brethren felt it hard to leave our beautiful Nauvoo and to go to the mountains. Had we not done this, some of the revelations of God would have fallen unfulfilled. I say to the Latter-day Saints, have faith. Let us have faith in the promises and revela-tions of God. Do you comprehend what is manifest in the earth today? The seeds of destruction are everywhere. The judgments of God are beginning to go forth. But who acknowledges the hand of God in these things? I rejoice that the cloud of darkness is being lifted from the eyes of our countrymen in re-gard to the Latter-day Saints, and that they are manifesting kindness towards us. Speaking of our visit East, I con-fess it was marvelous in my eyes to see how different these things are today to what they have been in the past. They begin to see that the people in the moun-tains of Israel are white men, and that they have some talent. I thank God for these things. I thank Him for the kindness we have received at the hands of the friends of our nation. My prayer to God is that His blessings may rest upon our nation and upon the leaders thereof, and that the spirit of liberty, of law, of righteousness and of truth may rest upon all American citizens and everybody that dwells under this great government. It is one of the greatest governments God ever raised upon the earth. What has it been raised up for? That in the midst of it the Lord might establish His Zion and His work.Brethren and sisters, let us be true and faithful to our duties and to our God. Let us look forward to the exaltation and the blessings that God has in store for those who keep His commandments. Every man will be judged according to the deeds done in the body. There are laws celestial, laws terrestrial, and laws telestial. We speak of the celestial glory and of the heavenly hosts. Who are the heavenly hosts? They are those who have tabernacled on this earth, been faithful to God, and passed behind the veil. And they are interested in the welfare of the inhabitants of the earth. They are interested in the salvation of the human family. They have labored for it in the flesh; they do so today in the spirit world. These are the people we look to by faith. We are here upon a mission. We are trying to fulfill that mission. I hope we may be true and faithful to it.I am thankful before the Lord for the blessings that I have enjoyed in this con-ference and for the testimonies I have heard from these Apostles. They speak as men having authority, inspired by the Spirit of God, and they speak the truth. Many of our friends that have labored with us have passed away. We our-selves shall pass away in our time. I may say that if it had not been for theprayers of these thousands of Latter-day Saints, I today should have been mingling with my brethren in the spirit world. I know that I have been preser-ved by the prayers of my brethren and sisters, and I am still with you. I feel very weak, and hardly qualified to mag-nify my calling as an Apostle, as the leader of the people of Israel; in fact, no man is, only as moved upon by the power of God. What little time I may stay here I hope my heart will not be set on the riches of this world, but on doing the will of God and uniting with my brethren in bearing off the great work and responsibility resting upon us. If we will do this, all will be right. When we get to the other side of the veil, we shall know something. We now work by faith. We have the evidence of things not seen. The resurrection, the eternal judgment, the celestial kingdom, and the great blessings that God has given in the holy anointings and endow-ment in the temples, are all for the future, and they will be fulfilled, for they are eternal truths. We will never while in the flesh, with this veil over us, fully comprehend that which lies before us in the world to come. It will pay any man to serve God and to keep His commandments the few days he lives upon the earth. With regard to our position before we came here, I will saythat we dwelt with the Father and with the Son, as expressed in the hymn, "O my Father," that has been sung here. That hymn is a revelation, though it was given unto us by a woman—Sister Snow. There are a great many sisters have the spirit of revelation. There is no reason why they should not be inspired as well as men. We dwelt in the presence of God before we came here, and we have been sent here upon a mission, and I do not want to live any longer myself than I can magnify that calling. What bene-fit is it to any man to dwell here and to miss the object for which he was sent, even eternal life? Therefore, it does not pay any man to sin. When a man sins it is because he yields to the enemy, not because the devil has power over him irrespective of his agency. The devil is laboring for the destruction of the human family. But the Gospel is sent into the world to save them.Brethren and sisters, God bless you. I am glad to meet with you and to have a little time to speak to you. I hope and trust we may be true and faithful to the end of our days, that we may be satisfied when we get through with our work; that our hearts may not be set up-on anything that perisheth, but that wemay do what we can to build up Zionand bring forth salvation to mankind as far as we have the opportunity while we dwell in the flesh. God bless us and guide us all i our work, for Jesus' sake. Amen

 IN EXPLANATION.Purpose—The purpose of the Press ClippingBureau is to supply people with those matters ofespecial interest to them printed in the newspapersof the country.Ground Covered.—It reads papers from everyregion of the United States and Canada, includingall the dailies of large cities, most of the dailies ofsmall cities, and thousands of weeklies. A cus-tomer may limit his order to any group of States,or any single State.Delivery.—A daily service is given whenever itis asked; otherwise its frequency depends on thesize of the order, but the clippings are delivered atleast once a week to all.Payment.—The Bureau has two systems of pay-ment, by the piece and by the month. Themethod of payment does not affect the thorough-ness of service.The piece price is five centsa clipping and prevails on all orders producingless than 100 clippings a month, on orders of atemporary nature, and on personal orders. Noorder will be taken for less than 100 clippings,and a minimum charge of ONE DOLLAR A MONTHwill be made for keeping any customer on ourbooks, whether clippings are found to that amountor not.Monthly rates are common in thecase of orders in business lines, making the costordinarily much less than by the piece, thougha low piece price can be quoted on large standingorders and is sometimes preferable.Remittance.—Payment in advance is not re-quired. Bills are rendered monthly, and we stipu-late that remittance be made to us every month, nomatter what the size of the bill.Credits.—In general, acceptance of clippingsbinds the customer to pay for them. Credit formatter not coming under the order cannot be givenafter thirty days. In justice to us we should be

 informed at once if we are sending classes of mat-ter that are not wanted.Duplicates.—It is not our intention to send anycustomer repetitions of the same fact, or copies ofthe same comment, unless they are specificallyrequested, but some duplication is unavoidable.Credit is given for duplicates returned at once orat the end of each month.Trivialities.—We decline to undertake that ouremployees shall exercise any judgment on ques-tions of triviality. We sell memory, not discrimi-nation. Customers are asked to bear in mindthat though more or less of the clippings may betrivial, a single clipping is often worth enough to offset the cost of many that are worthless.Restrictions.—The more an order is restricted,the harder it is to remember its limits and thegreater the danger useful matter will be omitted.Better pay a little more, and make sure to get allyou want. An order may extended or re-stricted at any time.Discontinuance.—One week's notice of discon-tinuance is to be given. This condition is waived in the case of orders given for a definite term, asfor one month; but if without demur the customerrecieves and retains clippings sent to him after theexpiration of that term, he is to be responsiblefor payment therefor at the same rate, no matterwhat previous conditions may have been imposed. No order will be accepted without this proviso, meantsimply to protect us in case service is inadver-tently continued and the customer fails to call ourattention to it.Competetion.—We will content ourselves withthe simple statement that whenever our work is tobe put in comparison with that of any other clip-ping bureau, we will make no charge for a week'strial if ours is not then acknowledged the better. We invite such comparisons.

 CLIPPINGS IN BUSINESS.Clippings are of use to any business man seek-ing business or doing business outside his ownneighborhood.They give earliest information of all State,county, city and town appropriations; keep sub-scribers posted on the published projects of corpor-ations, military and civic organizations, politicaland athletic clubs, fraternal and religious societies;and transmit information on a great variety ofother enterprises involving the expenditure ofmoney. In no other way can this information beso thoroughly, accurately, and promptly obtained,as it is here taken directly from the local press.Some of it may sooner or later be found in thetrade papers, but the Bureau beats them always bytwo days, and from that up to eight days, therebygiving subscribers a decided advantage over rivalswho depend on the trade papers alone.At the opportune time clippings furnish thenames and addresses of people in a position tobecome buyers, such as tradesmen opening newstores, extending, changing location, burned out;men retiring from business and therefore withmoney to invest or to spend, perhaps in travel;men suffering from accidents, resulting, for in-stance, in amputations, necessitating the purchaseof artificial limbs; women recently becoming moth-ers, and likely to buy baby food or baby carriages;women just married and therefore needing visitingcards or cook books.For general circularizing the addresses to beobtained from newspapers have been little used,presumably because it costs money to get them so,but in the end it is at least a question if that is notmore economical than the use of lists which everyday makes more full of errors because of deaths,removals, reverses of fortune, etc., and of the origi-nal accuracy of which there was little guarantee.Clippings furnish the addresses of society ladies in

 IN CONSTRUCTION LINES.Dealers in building supplies,  — in materials, infixtures, in furniture, — nowadays invariably makeuse of some source of information about construc-tion work. They may get it from contractors',architects', building, or real estate journals; orfrom type-written bulletins. In each of these casesthe great bulk of the news in reality comes fromlocal newspapers. We have for sale the source it-self, that is, the newspaper item, which is prefer-able for several reasons: First, re-publishing takestime; the journals are printed either weekly ormonthly, and their news must be from three daysto a month behind ours; the daily bulletin is oneor two days behind us. Secondly, in all transcrip-tion there is a percentage of error, and all conden-sation is likely to omit useful details; the pretencethat news re-published in bulletins has been veri-fied by correspondence with architects and owners,is rarely backed up by the facts; clippings give allthe news to be had, and give it with the maximumof accuracy. Thirdly, both journals and bulletinsordinarily give but one mention of any structure;by means of clippings, howeve[r, ] you can keepposted continuously as to the progress of the work,and in the case of all considerable edifices thereferences in the local press are frequent. Fourth-ly, the value of any business news decreases as thenumber of users increases; the more competitors,the less profit for each; journals and bulletins areaccessible to everybody; the use of clippings, bythe very nature of the business, is restricted. Noother building news medium whatever furnishesanything like the quantity of news about buildingin small places.Clippings cost about the same as the type-writ-ten bulletins; and much more than a single jour-nal, but no more than the subscription price of allthe journals that would have to be taken to furnish[h]alf the news obtainable through clippings, to say

 nothing of promptness, exhaustiveness, accuracy,and the trouble of handling many trade papers.In short, we believe that clippings furnish the mostand best building news at least cost.We make no pretence that a clipping is morethan it shows on the face. If there are errors in it,the fault is the newspaper's, not ours. We do notguarantee to send everything; we send all ourreaders can find. We send much useless matter,but thereby we make sure that no useful mattershall be lost through our own exercise of judg-ment, which is not and cannot be so good as thedealer's.It need hardly be pointed out that here morethan anywhere else the earliest news is far the bestnews. The salesman or catalogue or letter firston the spot, stands much the best chance of gettingthe order. We invite comparisons to show if thebulk of our news is not the earliest to be had, andwill make no charge for a week's trial if it proveotherwise.Comments on Construction Clippings."We are pleased with the service you have given us up to this time." — Cutler Mfg.
