There  were huge bodies of the glacier contin- ually breaking off, it is said that  from 100 to 1000 tons sometimes break off at once. It is supposed that this  has been going on for thousands of years, and yet it appears to make no  difference to the glacier. It is from these glaciers that the ice bergs come that fill the ocean.
