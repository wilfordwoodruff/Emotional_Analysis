I enclose a letter to Prest.  John Taylor in regard to my  financial matters. I have been  impressed to do this, seeing  no other way out, only to  sell the lot, which would let  me secure my home to my  family, for I have struggled  hard to do this, as you are  aware of the location, you  know something of the lot and  its value, though property here   is at low ebb, and cannot  scarcely be sold, and it is  almost impossible to borrow  money here on real estate.

 Naugatuck Conn;  March 25 1895.    Presedent Woodruff—    Dear Sir—    I hope you  will excuse me for taking the  liberty of addressing you. I have  a brother in Utah he went there  some five years ago. He sent a  letter to his mother but it got  mislaid somewhere and we lost  his address and as he belongs  to the Mormon Church, I thought  that if you would be kind  enough you might find out   his address and send it to me.  His name is James Hodgen and  he has a family. I don't think  he is in Salt Lake City for I  wrote two letters there and got them  returned. I b would be very much  Obliged to you

 In the autumn of 1842  a mormon missionary took  supper at Fathers and preach-  ed in the school house in  the vicinity of Milwaukee  Wis. Among other things he  said the Mormons were   going beyond the Rocky   Mountains but they were  going to return again, armed  with a sword of fire which  would prove the distruction of  all their enemies.

 the brethren and sisters from the  North, sent here to labor this  winter, are diligent in their  studies, and are taking hold  in earnest to learn their duties  and callings as laborers, and  it would be unwise for me to  express an opinion as to their  capabilities at this early date,  even if I were authorized to  do so. We feel to extend to  them every facility within  our reach to aid them to  be thorough practiced workers.    We are having good times  in the Temple, and good  congregations for the time of  year and the busy crowded  season, which our people  in this land are now experiencing.

 among his general remarks he stated that he would  be very thankful if he could once more speak to the  people in Nauvoo. I was rather surprised at such a remark,  but had no idea of the sequel, or I should have been  more particular to rem^em^ber his conversation. I however tried  to rally him from his apparent gloom and dispondency  feelings, and told him I had confidence that he would yet  speak to his brethren many times in Nauvoo; he thanked  me for my remarks, and my efforts; my motives he  of course perfectly understood.    On the next morning, the 27th it was ascertained  that the Governor was preparing to leave for the city, as  was already intimated, and that the trial had been postponed  to suit the occasion; not fearing any danger at hand I sug-  gested to the prophet, that unless he desired me to remain  with them that day, I should like to also go to the city  to witness the proceedings there, and again return to see  the thing out in Carthage during the trial. Both he and Hiram  approved of my going, and in addition gave me a mission to  assist Bro. C. H. Wheelock, whom they had already dispatched to no-  tify a number of witnesses to attend the coming trial. To provide  for my safety to Nauvoo, I procured a pass from the Governor  through the jailor; this pass I have had for years in my possession,  but is now mislaid or entirely lost. I followed the troops  at some distance, not wishing to travel with them; was in  time to hear the Governor deliver to a large assembly one of the  most scandalous and outragous and untruthful speeches that could  well be fabricated. This ended, I made a flying visit to my  family for the night; and at the break of day next morning,  as I was arranging to start on my mission, a startling cry was  over

As soon as you shall have collected  the money, please write me, or as soon  as you make the attempt to do it, write  me and let me know how you succeed.    When you collect the the money, deduce  from it the amount of your expenses and  troubles.    All is well with us. We are daily  looking for news from the valley.

I am a native of Switzer-  land, and, besides the languages  above mentioned, I speak Spanish  and Italian, though neither of   these latter perfectly.

Yet I would not like at that season  to make the studies too hard for  the children, and this way they  may learn without much labor.    These systems are very good for  a beginning, but they do not ex-  clude the hard work that has to  come afterwards, necessarily.

And  besides this L I left one thousend dollars or more   worth of Books of Mormon, Receved at h wholesale   Price all free and clear of debt, and the Binding   paid for out of my own Pocket, for which I had   Rec'd Books of Mormon at full price to pay my   self. the Account of these Book, and the thousand   dollars worth, clear I Gave a bill of to Elder   Young and the twelve when I arived in America.   And they afterwards noted them to be spent in send   ing out certain Emigrants. And to this day I   have never had but one Book of Mormon out of that   whole Edition without paying full price for it   cash in hand, and I even charged myself with   all that was missing for Bad debts. Say 30 Pounds   Sterling to John Ma tuley, for which I have  never Rec'd a farthing, and many other such like   debts in the Book agency.

 Now if Mr N Fielding and Clark have neglect-  ed to settle these things, according to agreement, it is  wilful neglect on their part, or at least on the  part of Br Fielding, as he had money enough to   do it with. But if on the other hand, they have  done what I have paid them for doing, then the  families claiming passage on ac. of money had by  me is all a fraud or forgery. and in either case  it is both unjust, and unreasonable, and unlooked  for by me. I owe nobody in Eng, for any  thing but Mr Brown for the flour, and that I   Expected the office had settled years ago.    I appeal to Elder Ward, for testimony that I was  very particular in settleing every thing in a fair  and honerable way with the office, and that I g[ave]  an exact [and] particular account, of all who ha[ve]  deposited money to go to america with, and made ar  rangements for it to be met, and paid it over in  settlement with El's Fielding, Clark, and Ward.    I mistrust there is something very wrong, or neglectful  some where, and perhaps Elder Ward, will know where   the wrong or neglect lies.    On the subject of a Box of hardware sent to me from  Liverpool to sell, the duties are fifty Dollars, and the  same articles selling in New York at one half the price  marked in the Bill. I have not the first picaune,  to pay the duties, nor even to by a pare of trousers, or  to pay a barber for shaving me. I have men in debt  for my passage clothing and other expences about a hun-  dred and fifty dollars since I left home. And I have  finally left New York because I could not maintain my  self, and preach and write, Gratis any longer, especially to  empty walls. I am now in Boston. I have more hear-  ers and better attention here, but no support, or even means  to pay expenses or clothing.

 Saint Louis Septr 12th 1848    Brother W. Woodruff    The foregoing in a copy of a  letter sent to England  by Brother Levi Richards and have taken the opportunity of presenting the same  to you that you might understand the arrangement made there.    Brother Philo Dibble's Sceneries Museum &c  Beloved brethren Orson Pratt and Osrson Spencer.    Levi Richards to England  affords me an opportunity of addressing you upon a subject the interest of which I  know lies very near your hearts. Inasmuch as your name Bro Spencer was given ^1st^ to  sanction and influence my feeble efforts in support of the noble cause of illustrating  by painting the history of the Church. Others in common with yourself gave  the helping hand, until the pencil of the Artist yielded to the inspiration of mind  and the mighty passing events, the changing scences, the Vicissitudes of the Saints  under the direct persecutions, and the travails of the Church, contending against the  oppressions, errors, and superstitions of ungodly men.    Which will stand forever as a "way mark" of the rise and progress of the Church of  the last days. As the importance of the work grew, upon me and I needed a more extensive  patronage.    The 1st Presidency and the leading authorities of the Church were the willing supporters  and the hearty co-operaters, in placing these high objects before the saints, scattered   throughout all the world and their magnitude.    The importance of uniting their Interests, with my labors in this Department of  of the building up the Kingdom of God    To you also Bro Pratt I am indebted, for your whole soul engagedness as a living  witness of the Truthfulness of my humble efforts to make a Joseph and a Hyram appear  and speak to the Eye and heart of the thousands of Saints assembled at nauvoo,  Winter Quarters, and Council Bluffs, and may I not say, shall yet speak to  the millions of this generation.    Permit me therefore dear brethren to lay before the the Saints in England, Ireland,  Scotland and Wales and wherever your infulence can be extended.    The nature, design, history, and importance of this work. I have already   nearly completed two scenes of a series, one illustrating Joseph addressing the  Nauvoo Legion three Days prior to his imprisionment in Carthage Jail  The other the murder of Joseph and Hyrum, while under arrest each  scene comprising 128 feet of canvass.    The designs are by Bro Robert Campbell who is engaged in visiting  places taking sketches, and making himself acquainted with all the essential  matters and facts, as they may connect themselves with historical paintings  The execution of the designs of the above sceneries, established the reputation  of Bro Campbell among as for faithful portraiture    Bro Major of many years experience, has also devoted his labors in this work  Many painters have made a sacrifice of time in responding to my calls upon their labors.  Bro Campbell has many sketches of the sceneries mentioned in my "preface"  These will appear as soon as means can be obtained to carry on the work in the  Valley of the Great Salt Lake    Eschition [Exhibition] of the Sceneries are given from time to time, as wisdom shall dictate

 But I donot complain, the saints have done well   in tithing, and in sending their, arms and means to Nauvoo,   and in contributing to Wm. Smith G. J.

 Every exhibition, increases the interest in as much, as they display at one glance  the most striking likenesses, of the great actors of these scenes,  The familiarity they assosciate with times, places, buildings &c   Even the persons who are the specttators have frequently to exclaim, "I was there"  So that the while they feel anxious to hand down to posterity, our illustrious  Martyrs, and record these visions of the past events, at once embraced subjects  connecting their own salvation, and interests with these sceneries.    Again these exhibitions form a text from which the most important transaction  are expatiated upon at large by our public speakers, and a flow of light and   intelligence burst upon the audience.    And here let me remind you of the evening when the most thrilling effects  were produced by the brilliant addresses of Bro Woodruff yourself &  Bro Joseph Young during the april Conference.    Nor was the eschibition given on the 4th July without its interest, many  things were elicited from Bro George A. Smith worthy of record, touching  the death of Joseph & Hyrum Smith, of the few remaining since the first organ-  isation of the Church, of himself, and those left of the smith family.    Of the honor conferred on Bro George D. Watt for his "hen scratching"  (Phonographic outline of the trial of the murderers of the Smiths)  Brother Campbell was present also and made ^remarks^ relative to the sceneries  coming up through sacrafice and Tribulation.    I would wish to speak further upon the necssity of the Saints abroad  waking up to this subject, that God has from time, to time, by revelation  and by Epistle made it their duty to help by their means, and substance  in the building up a Museum, and my object in addressing you is to get all  the necessary materials of Glass, Nails, Oils, Paints, &c to take to the valley  next spring for the purpose of building A. Museum.    Will not all the Saints scattered throughout England, Scotland, Ireland,  and Wales, help me in this matter.    That A Museum may be established, in the Valley of the Great Salt  Lake as a repository in which shall be collected from all parts of  the Earth specimens of the works of nature and art, to connect with  these sceneries.    And you will ^will you^ not Dear Brethren, continue to exert an influence in   supporting and aiding in this work, that returns may be made by the  fall season.    I hope also the artisit, will not fail to bring all necessary means  connected with their profession to assist in painting these designs.  Deposits necessary to obtain a perpetual right to the Museum &c  Any person depositing one Dollar has a free admission to the Museum  until the Dollar is withdrawn    Any person depositing Five Dollars, may obtain a medal which  Shall be a perpetual right to admission, shall record his history in  the "Museum" Record, shall also be entitled to a Portrait of himself  upon a seperate scenery so connecting him with Bro "Joseph" & "Hyrum"  and the "Twelve" as the principal actors in this great work, to be handed  down to the rising generation

But to our great  surprise we found a people prepared to recieve  us gladly. After a little labour with them 12  adults presented themselves as candidates for  baptism. A Branch was organized out of this  new material, & others were shortly after added  by baptism, untill it beame a flourishing  branch of the Church.

As a rule the people were very  bitter & much predjudiced. Notwithstanding   through courtesy & the spirit of kindness we  succeeded in making many friends  although our labours were located in a very  wicked & corrupt portion of the country

Dear Sir:   I have been commissioned by a number of leading journals to prepare an articl on "The Longevity of Noted Americans," and the reasons therefor,   and it would greaatly aid me in my purpose if you would kindly give brief answers to th follwing questions:      1. Were you strong or delicate in youth, and how much of that period of  your life did you spend in the open air? {[Strong] in youth; spent most the time in the open air.}  2. Was your health favorably influenced by an special manner of living  while young?{Regular diet consisted of plain food; worked hard on farm and in flouring mill.}   3. What changes in your daily habits did you make on the approach of a  ripe old age? {None particularly, excepting that I did not work so hard, but I work all the same.}  4. What have been your recreations in recent years? {None excepting fishing.}  5. How long do you sleep? lie in bed about 8 hours  6. What are your habits with regard to taking food? {Meals 3 times a day,; [illegible] the [pleasure] of a good potato I enjoy all kinds of food.}  7.

 New York Dec. 26th 1845    Dear Brother Woodruff. With a very bad pen  and in great haste, I imbrace the opportunity  that this evening to answer your kind letter, which  very unexpectedly came to hand this morning.  The Saints in the eastern country are all alive  in the cause of gathering across the mountains  moreso so than they have been heretofore in  gathering to Nauvoo. I have heard nothing  said by the Twelve concerning what course  would be persued by the saints in England, nei-  ther of your stay or return, but I pre-  sume it will be much cheeper for the  saints their to emigrate by water—for it  is a great deal cheeper for the eastern  saints to emigrate from here by water and  of course it will be for you. I have chartered  a Bark of 450 tons for $6000. I shall  take about 200 tons ^of^ freight for the san  Sandwich Islands at 16 dollars per ton  which will reduce the expence about to  about 3800 say four 4000 dollars  I shall carry about 126^5^ saints with me,  which will be more ^less^ than one half of the  expence than going by land. Brother Sherrill  was in here this evening having just arrived

 Springville Nov. 21st 1884    Prest Wilford Woodruff Historian of the Church  of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints,    Dear Brother;    Feeling the importance of having  incidents that have transpired in our history and  phenomena which we accept as evidence of the com-  ing forth of the work of the last days—therefore  I consider it my duty to present a few items  for your consideration to be placed upon the pages  of our History, if you deem it worthy of a place there.    One circumstance was a phenomenon  which occured in my boyhood, which was seen  by my Father's family—I being among them. I  think it must have occurred 1825 and 1830. I  should think about the month of September between  the hours of 6 and 9 o'clk. in the evening.    We saw a very large army of Soldiers (to all  appearance) marching in the firmament, coming from  a North Westerly direction and meeting a similar army  from a South Easterly direction, nearly over our heads.  We were standing at the West door of my father's house  and saw the army from the North West most distinctly  and saw the front of the opposite army also.    We saw them march up and apparently discharge  firearms and I am almost sure that I saw the  flash of the same, and probably heard the report, but  being but a child, and it being about 55 years ago,  I would not like to be too positive as to hearing 
 On the 20th of October 1881 Bro David Cook &  of East Bountiful, Davis Co & myself whilst  engaged in conducting services in the open air  notwithstanding we were strictly guarded in our  utterances. We were violently assauted by a reckless  mob led on by the following persons. James Cousins  carpenter, James Dutton market Inspector, Samuel  Yarwood cab proprietor, & Matthew Sweetman  coal proprietor, they followed us with threats &  imprecations to our abode & then requested that  we should be brought forth to them. The first  named of those leaders, has annoyed our brethren for  many years past, & in my hearing has declared that  he will never cease as long as he has a breath to  draw.

When to all appearance they  had discharged their pieces they would open  to the right and left, and countermarch to  the rear, and others come to the front and so  continued to march to the front—discharge and  counter march—this continued for about an hour  and probably longer.

 My dear Sir,    I have not answered your kind Letter  as I intended, through mingled stress of business and  sickness. My state of health has of late forbid  all unnecessary labor on my part, and I now only   write to bid you good bye. I sail for the West  Indies from New York on Friday next—to be gone,  God only knows how long—perhaps it is well I do not  surely know myself. My health at last seems to be  rapidly declining. So bid good bye to all my friends  for me; I do not name them, lest in my haste I should  omit any. Sorry indeed I am I should have   lived to know of a point of difference between us;

Dear Brother;  Some six or eight years ago,  at Kanarrah, you kindly proffered me  a home and support in Salt Lake City,  I did not then accept, not desiring to be a  burden to the Church or my friends, but I find  my sight failing me and my children  unable to render me needed assistance,  I therefore feel under obligation to accept  any kindness at your hands, that you will be  pleased to give me. I am without a home and  would like one near the Manti Temple so that  I can do the work for my dead. Dear Brother  I have wrote this to you that you may assist me  to a home at Manti, if it meets with your wishes,  please write to me and let me know.    With very kind regards Your Brother  Thomas Woolsey

Respected, and Dear Sir-    If agreeable to yourself, I would be pleased to  have an interview with you relative to the great beneficiary work in  which it is my privilege to be engaged.    The "Woodmen of the world," is one of the most liberal, yet one  of the most careful, societies in the world, as to the habits, morals,  and character of the men who compose its membership. The practical  benefits it brings to its membership, are of the most desirable char-  acter. It is non-religious, and non-political in its realation to the  various churches, or poloitical parties.    Your people, are just as much entitled to the benefits of this  society, as any in the broad earth; and it is to tell you all about  "The Woodmen," and looking toward the enlisting of your people in  this purely mutual benefit society, that I desire to see you.    Will you kindly name the time and place that I may call.    Praying the blessing of HIM who can, and will direct  in all good, to bless you with great wisdom, and grace,    I am my dear sir-    Yours Very Truly-  W S Falkenburg.  Deputy Head Consul,  W. O.

 Ogden Utah May 31st 1896    President Wilford Woodruff  Salt Lake City Utah    Dear Brother:  Some months ago Bro E. T. Wooley  of this city handed to you a letter written  by me Nov 28 [18]95; regarding a memorial arch  and Pioneer square in Salt Lake city;   without any Explaination; Said you was verry  busy at the time; ^I^ was verry sorry he did not  expain my position; I gave Bro Wooley the manuscript  & with it my reasons for sending a copy to you, he  took off two copyes in duplicate, one he sendt to  me & the other he took to you. There is a slight mistake  or two in the Type written copiys; After writing  this article; my wife read it over to me the  first time, after reading it she said, Pa you  aught to send that to President Woodruff!  At the same instant, the same feeling came upon  me. Soon after this my Brother in Law Bishop  White ^Brothers^ Jos Parry & David M Stewart called  in to see me. I let them read the article 
 I wish also to state that I have at different times heard  my Father Asahel Perry state that he was at Kirtland O.  to visit the Prophet at the time that the first Council was  called in relation to building the Temple in that place.    Aaron C. Lyon had accompanied my Father from our residen  ce in Genesee Co. N. Y. to Kirtland O.  Joseph invi-  ted them to attend the Council, and after opening the same  he presented the business of building the Temple to the  people convened, and then called upon those present for an  expression of their feelings.  When most of the brethren pres-  ent seemed to feel that the Church was too poor to build  a building of the magnitude required, and thought they  had better build something smaller and less expensive.  During the discussion Father Lyon and my Father, step'd  to one side and conferred together as to whether they  had any money to spare for this purpose, and have  sufficient left to take them home. They concluded  they could spare a trifle each. They returned and pre-  sented (if my memory serves me right) A. C. Lyon $10.00  Asahel Perry $5.00 Whereupon Joseph arose (and as  my Father said) spoke in a very energetic manner saying  the work had commenced and the House would be built  according to the pattern presented.    In the month of May  1836 we moved to Kirtland and bought a farm. Some  time after many of the Saints being in very distressed  circumstances, my Father gave to Joseph $10000 in  money for the benefit of the poor.

I thought  to report my labors during conference time as it would  cost me much less than to proceed with the company and  return. I found my family on arriving all well But  on Sunday 26th two days after my arrival the two  children of my second wife were taken ill with the  "Malignant type of scarlet fever." After several days  of anxiety &c they died Oct 4th and 5th.  This has  been the severest trial of my life. It seemed from the  first that they were to go As nothing we could do seemed  to benefit them in the least. Truly the Lord had a  design in taking them away. I feel to recognise His  hand and our only hope is That we may prove  ourselves worthy to receive them in morning of the  first resurrection. I have had quite a serious  time with my wife as they were all she had. However  she is becoming more reconciled. The recent visit of our  beloved Sister Zina Young seems to have done her  a great deal of good. However I dont wish to

 Philadelphia  April 19th 1846    Dear Br W. Woodruff    I arrived here yesterday after  noon to assist in organizing the Branch of the Church &c.  here as Elder Lutz leaves with his family on Wed  nesday next for the West. I had purposed of coming  too, But circumstances, has seemed to place me other  wise. You know of Mothers sickness, as you heard in   Philadephia. She is confined to her Room at my house  yet, but she is getting better, but she has not been  able to move, neither can I tell at present when  she will be. I have lost a neice 24 years old ( I  believe or more) and also a Brother—the niece was   buried the thirsday before I left you in Philadephia  and my Brothers funeral I attended last thirsday  Both died in a few minutes after they were too   hear; and what is worst of all, had never obeyed  the Gospel. We durst not let Mother know it under  her present weak circumstances. Therefore under the   present existing affairs I do not know, when I shall   get started. If not son, I shall endeavor to assist  Elder Little in getting up a ship. As I have  received a letter from Br Hyde since I saw  you telling me that is what they wish me to do, and  to go my whole length and breadth in getting  out a compay to follow Elder Brannan. I  have wrote back, to Br Hyde, giving him a de  tail of my proceedings as I informed you

I was appointed  to Labor in the Sheffield conference under the direction  of Prest Geo R. Emery.

I was appointed to  labor in the Leeds conference under the  direction of Prest Isaac Smith and B. S. Young  consecutively. My labors in this section were  very gratifying as I made many friends  among strangers spreading a Knowledge of the  truth &c.

 Out of Tune.  There are rumors of war in local musical  circles, but as yet hostilities are confined  threats, insinuations and prophecies. The  prospective beligerants are the Salt Lake  Theatre orchestra and the Musicians Pro-  tective union. The union now has a mem-  bership of about 125, and the officers claim  that the members of the orchestra are  about the only musicians in the city who  have not come into the fold. The Duff  Opera company will play an engagement at  the theatre this week and it is stated the   orchestra will have to be enlarged for the  occasion. The union officers say no mem-  ber of the union will be permitted to play   and there are on other available musicians   in the city.    Mr. Burton treats the matter very lightly  and says he does not know yet that he will  be required to increase his orchestra, but if  it is necessary he anticipates no trouble.  It is a matter of no concern to him whether  the members of his orchestra join the  union or not.

I said if that  is your mind you may set me apart  he answered, No I must have the  consent of Bro Woodruff, some time  ago I got a letter from Bro L Snow   saying I had better write you on the  Subject, hence my reason for writing to you 
 4    In the Winter of 1837 and 8 When Joseph's Family  started for Missouri, my eldest brother Isaac Perry  furnished them a new wagon in which to make the move    In the Spring of 1838 my Father turned out  his farm which he had bought in Kirtland selling it  for the sum of $3400.00 receiving only $20000 of  the money—the rest going to settle a debt against  the Church in the City of New York—the names of  Joseph Smith Jr., Hyram Smith and Sidney Rigdon be-  ing signed to ^this obligation^ and held for the payment of the same.    For this remaining amount of $3200.00 he drew  orders on the Church in Missouri. We arrived in  Mo. in June 1838 but were driven from our homes in  Davis Co. in Nov. following, and subsequently in Feb.  1839 we were expelled from the state in the general exo-  dus of the Church. Subsequently at the first Con-  ference held at Commerce (afterwards Nauvoo) in the  fall of 1839 he gave up his obligation against the Church  consecrating the same thereto. From this   time forward he managed to live without becoming  a charge to any considerable extent upon any body  except myself.  This I also submit for your  consideration.

 If I can be of more service to the cause of God  and his people by staying here, and assisting  Elder Little in getting up a ship and send  ing out Emigrants. I desire to be here.

He does not yet belng to the Church but  he is a firm believer, he accompanies Br Lutz  and Malin out. I have given him a letter of  introduction, he has been very kind. I solicited    and got him to advance three hundred dollars  for Elder Lutz, and two hundred for Br Malin  to assist them in gathering out.

 health being troubled with indigestion and liver  to that extent Bro Budge thought were I to  remain another winter it would permanently  injure my health.

 TO THE SAINTS SCATTERED ABROAD—GREETING:    BELOVED BRETHREN AND FRIENDS:    After so long a time, we have heard direct from Elder LYMAN WIGHT, and have learned his whereabouts. He is in Texas, and I think  on one of the tributaries of the Colorado River, about seventy five miles from the city of Austin. He has addressed a pamphlet of sixteen  pages to the Latter Day Saints, scattered abroad, and to every body else, containing his appeals to them, and the cogitations of his own mind.    If the Lord had inspired him to write his appeal, it would have been received with respect and cordiality. But it would seem that his  inspiration came from no higher source than George Miller. He speaks much about being put out of his place and some one also called to fill  it. If this had been contemplated, and even carried into effect, the Council of the Church would not have gone beyond their power and right, if  they had thought it necessary to be done: But to reproach the person supposed to occupy his place with the appellation of "A LONG EARED JACK  ASS," is but to reproach the Council by whom he was appointed, if appointed at all. The spirit of alienation and jealousy is too apparent in his  writings: No person has been suggested to fill his place, to my knowledge; and if he had been dictated by the Spirit of the Lord, he would have  written a confidential letter to the Council of his brethren, and enquired into all these matters, before venturing to throw out such a volley of most  extravagant and uncalled for language as his pamphlet contains. But it seems that he has taken Bishop Miller for his prompter, who lost the  Spirit of the Lord by his over anxiety to run forward to Grand Island, to Punkand, and to "Bullyhuck," that he might show himself a little  smarter man than any other in the camp: and when the Spirit of the Lord had left him, he learned that the Twelve were not right, and resolved  to follow them no longer, when the truth was, he never would follow, but always run ahead. He left the body of the Church without counsel  and without the fellowship of the Saints.    If Bro. Wight had been as anxious to keep up a friendly intercourse and correspondence with the Church and Council, and maintain a perma-  nent union and alliance with them, as he now is to sow the seeds of dissension, by scattering his pamphlets among the OUTER BRANCHES of the  Church, could he not long ago have sent a messenger to hunt us up, as well as to send one now to distribute his pamphlets, the products of his  own misguided zeal, breathing manifestly the spirit of separation from the Church and Council? If we were broken up and gone from Nauvoo,  we were not gone out of the world. The very spirit of his apology for not writing to us, clearly shows that he lacked more the inclination to  write than the opportunity of sending a letter. This is in accordance with some expressions of his concerning his desire to be accounted as one  of the Twelve on his leaving Nauvoo. It may be proper, at some time, to note them.    He appeals to those of like ordination with himself to know if they have any power or authority given them to remove him from his station.  For one, I can say that I have been ordained to all the power and authority that Bro. Wight ever was, and I can inform him that he is not yet so  high that the voice of the Council cannot reach him and bring him down, and even put another in his place if they deem it necessary. Sidney  Rigdon was ordained to all that Bro. Wight ever was, and rather more, but the arm and voice of God's Council brought him down and dried up  the fountain of his spirits. Lucifer was even higher than Bro. Wight, yet he was thrust down by those with whom he stood connected: and be  it known, and known to all, that the Council has power to expel any member of its body from the same, when that member ceases to act pursu-  ant to its dictates. If this be not a true doctrine, Lucifer could have stood his ground in heaven and bid as loudly defiance to the powers there, as  Bro. Wight has in his pamplet to all the powers of the world, the Church, Angels and men. But the former was cast down, and the Council at  the Salt Lake City, with the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, must determine the portion of the latter after having canvassed his pamphlet and  considered it in connection with this circular.    Why does Bro. Wight teach and enforce a doctrine that Joseph Smith never did nor never would sanction? Namely: a community of goods,  or property thrown in together as common stock. Though this doctrine has sometimes been practiced by good men, but the original purpose and  design of God was to make men accountable for their stewartship, and therefore, "to one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one;   and to every man according to his several ability." The whole course and order of nature—the constitutional organization of man—the voice  of the martyred prophet of the last days, and the eternal purpose of God, all stand opposed to Bro. Wight's "common stock" principles; and no  people can prosper that enforce this as a law among themselves. I call not upon Heaven and Earth, Angels and men for my "indemnity," but  let my communications be yea, yea, and nay, nay; and leave the remainder to Bro. Lyman.    With regard to keys and priesthood, Bro. Wight is just as lame as he is about the power not existing to displace him, and one day it will  meet him in the face; and though I am a fool, there ARE men in this Church that can measure his bushel in their peck without shaking down or  pressing it together. Men have done something here besides wearing fine clothes, and have learned something better and more generous than to  throw out any such low insinuations.    When men get a mission according to their own hearts' desires in answer to long and repeated importunities, they ought not to murmur or  complain at their hardships if they even have "to sell their last coat for food." It was a work craved because of an apparent unwillingness to  remain with the Council and fare as they did, receive the chastisements and corrections which they did, and thus become perfected in the midst  of counsel. Israel once received a king because of their great murmurings and importunities, but was he a blessing or a curse to them? It is  said not to be the nature of "the wild ram of the mountains" to herd in the domestic fold, and if it does not yet appear that Joseph Smith gave to  Lyman Wight his great mission with a similar motive to that with which the Lord gave a soul to Israel, I will confess my mistake.    The Churches are exhorted to continue their emigration and in the discharge of their various duties, as counselled and directed in the late  General Epistle of the Twelve, and pay no attention to Bro. Wight's call until it is sanctioned by the First Presidency of the Church, at the Salt  Lake City, and also by the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. Bro. Wight may collect around him the whole phalanx of wild, disaffected and in-  dependent spirits, even from the "Pagan Prophet" down to the "Brewster Seer." But these combustible materials, gathered together, render  explosion more certain and its consequences more destructive. None of us are at war with Bro. Wight's mission, but with his boasting and de-  fying spirit.    The next circular that I issue, I hope may come from our own press at Council Bluffs, under the head of the "FRONTIER GUARDIAN."    Now, Brethren, farewell! May the blessing of Him who died and rose again from the dead, be with you always and keep you steadfast and  immovable in the truth, and guide your steps to the celestial city where the Saints meet in peace.    With great respect, I have the honor to be,    Your brother in the Bonds of the Covenant,    ORSON HYDE. 
 Cambridgeport Mass Feb 24th 1849    President Young & Council,    Dear Brethren,    Since I have   been travelling in this eastern country which is so Highly famed   for the education of their children, I have endeavoured to bear in mind   that portion of the epistle which councils the Saints, "To secure at least A copy of   Evry valuable treatise on Education" &c, &c. I have reflected much upon this subject, &   the situation of the Saints in the valley, the thousands of children that will be   congregated there. And not ownly the importance of their having school Books to   read & learn from, but the importance of their having such Books as will attract   their attention, and be adapted to the capacity of children, & youth. Also of intro-  ducing a class of Books that will be accepted & recommended by the Presidency or  a Board of Education which they may appoint, as their would be a great Benefit   derived in Having a uniformity of school Books introduced throughout the   schools of the Latter day Saints. I have not supposed that the Saints would   vary materially from the world in introducing the first rudiments of education   into their schools, ownly to make the best selection they could. The Saints   would of course differ from the world & Christendom in their religious teaching   which in some measure would be a seperate branch from teaching the common   branches of education.    It has been under this view of the   subject that I have taken pains to investigate the present system of education   in New England, And obtain copies of some maps, charts, Books &c and the  report of their board of education. The State of Maine & others are making   great improvements in their system of education, introducing new modes of   teaching, using the Black board, making New school Houses upon a New plan, ventilating  at the top of the windows, making pleasure grouds &c &c. A copy of the drafts I   forward to you with this letter which you will find is a Book entitled   Report of the Board of Education of the State of 1847. A New series of Books   are now being introduced through the U. S. which are prefered before all others   they were got up by a company of Men in the city of Portland Maine   by A board of Education which was composed (it was said) of the best talent,   of the country, who collected a copy of all the works in use in the United States,  and out of them & their own branes formed the Books. The name of the Readers   1, 2, 3, 4, Are called Town's Also the speller and Definer, and Analysis. His name was given to them   as He was the author of much of their contents: yet the Board made great Alterations from

 Philadelphia April 5th 1849    President Young & Council    Dear Brethren    As near two months  have passed away since I wrote my other letters I thought I  would add a little more before they go. two companies of  Saints are preparing to leave the Eastern States for the west  & will start in few days. Those at Boston & East & North  of there rendezvous at Worcester &Mass & go with Br Haven via  of Abany, Buffalo, Chicago & St. Louis to the Bluffs, but I think  that company will be small, those at New Haven New York  & philadelphia &c Start from Phil & are led lead by Elder  Appleby will take the Southern route about 50 will go from  the philadelphia Brach. Since I last wrote I have observed  wherever I have traveld & preached, A revival of the Spirit of  Enquiry & investigation of the principles of the Latter Day Saints  & feeling after the Gospel of Jesus Christ by that portion of com-  munity who are honest in heart & are reflecting upon the signs  of the times which are now developing themselves before the Eyes of  this generation in fulfillment of ancient and modern prophecy  & the Revelations of Jesus Christ. It is true this class are like the  gleaning of grapes after the vintage is done, few when compared with  the mass, yet with them I find at the present time the strong  foundations of their prejudice against our cause is giving away  they are candidly enquiring after our principles religion & welfare  & in a good number of instances are Embracing the work, as  an Exh example I will say that before I came here I spent  several weeks with my family in Cambridgeport during which  time I held meetings on the Sabbath & weekday evenings in  my own hired house & those of my Brethern & we had full  houses, & many began to investigate & some strong minded men  & the result was we Baptized 8 in few days & as many more are  ready for the water, when I left, among those which I Baptized  was A Mr Snow & Lady that attended with Br Whipple Also 
 St George,   2nd June 1877.    To   President Brigham Young,  Salt Lake City.    Dear Brother,    Enclosed please  find Exhibit of Ordinance-work done in  St George Temple during the Month of May.    We worked during the month 5 days in  Baptizing averaging 721 per day; and we  gave Endowments 14 days averaging 129 En-  dowments per day.    We are thankful that a deeply earnest,  devout, spirit characterizes the administrations  of the brethren and sisters who assist in the  Temple and the same spirit evidently rests  upon those who are administered to.    Part of the month, as you have already  learned, my health has been poor, such indeed  as to keep me away from the Temple on some  of the working days. I thank the Lord my  health is much improved now, though some  of the saints say I look very thin and pale yet. 
 St George, Augt 20th 1877.    To   President Brigham Young,  Salt Lake City.    Dear Brother,    As October  Conference is approaching we desire to ask  if you approve of our leaving here, say  about the middle of next month, for Salt  Lake City to attend Conference and briefly  visit our famlies and friends?    The Temple needs a thorough clean-  ing of floors, and of some of the painted  work; carpets need to be taken up, beaten  and replaced; screens need to be washed  and, after some nine months use, a  little general renovation, will be timely.  If you approve of our going to Salt  Lake City, shall we adjourn Temple  Ceremonial work for, say, six weeks, and  have this work attended to?    After we have the floors cleaned 
 Salt Lake City Jan 1, 1871.    President Brigham Young    Dear Brother    I wish you  A Happy New Year, and all associated with you. I trust  you in a measure are having a rest for a season from the  many cares and labors which have rested upon you while in  this City. I think all things are as well with us as can  be expected in your absence. We have had good  meeting and the spirit of the Lord has attended us in our  school, and In the Tabernacle. We had a full House to  day Brother Bywater spoke in the Morning, and C. C. Rich  this Afternoon and I followed. I think Brother Wells  has manifested the spirit of Wisdom in presiding since you  left. Our Quorum are all well as usual. Brother Taylor is  recovering, was with us this Evening in the prayer circle.  My object in writing at present is to say a few words concerning  Wilford who has been residing at St Thomas for several years,  when he was called there I told him to go & stay as long as presidt  Young wished him to. I learn they are now abandoning that  place. I fitted him out & have sustained him there at an   expens of some $1500. And if he now can be honorably released  I would like to have him come home if he can have your  consent and Approbation to do so, but not with without, for I do not 
 Stanley Buildings, Bath St  Liverpool, Oct. 1st 1845    President Brigham Young    Beloved Brother and President in the  Kingdom of God, whom I love of a truth for the Truth's sake  that dwelleth in you. I seat myself once more in this  life to make an address to you with pen and ink. I have  now lying before me three letters from you of dates—Feb'y 11th  (by A. Fielding) June 27th and lastly August 21st for all of which  favors I feel thankful; for you may rest assured they operate  upon my spirit like a live coal from off the altar and kindles  a flame in my soul. I feel to magnify the name of God  for the manner he has sustained, inspired and upheld you since  the death of Joseph and Hyrum and the way he is giving a  signal victory to the citizens of Zion the city of Joseph. I look  upon it myself, as a great omen and evidence that the time  has come to favour Zion, and that her Sun and Light must and  shall speedily go forth propelled by the spirit and strength of  the God of Israel, until Zion arises with all her strength, power,  Beauty and Glory until she fully accomplishes all that the ancient  prophets anticipated; yea: I rejoice in the prosperity of all, of which  your letters speak. My prayers have ascended day and night  before God that he would not only do by His servant Brigham  Young as he did by Joshua of old after the death of Moses  but that he would do as much better by him as the greatness  labour and work of this dispensation required. [##Joshua 1:1-9##] I have  also remembered all the Twelve and Elders in all the world.  I thank you for all the information and instruction you have  given me and of so often speaking of our only son in Zion. We   are all well at present. Our youngest son is two months old, the  largest and healthiest child we ever had of his age. All is  going on as well as can be expected in this country considering  all thinges. the few wise labourers &c. Elder Jones I think is  doing well in Wales; he has laboured faithfully and sown  much seed that is now taking root and beginning to bring  forth much fruit; within a few days past they have baptized  two Campbellite Evangelists or ministers and they are ordained  priests (I ordained one of them) and a prospect of their doing much  good. Brother Jones has preached very extensively in the largest  cities and towns through the Welsh domains, and said, there  were nearly a hundred added to the branches in that land  a few weeks before he left to pay me a visit.    I have held on to what few American Elders there are in  this land according to your request except Elders Holmes  and Hardy from George Town, Masss—they had settled their  affairs and were about ready to sail when your letter arrived,  and Elder Hardy's family is in such a situation, he is obliged  to go home so I did not stop them. But I think we can hold  our own until some help comes from Nauvoo. The company of  some Elders from there as soon as they get their endowment will  meet with a welcome reception in this land. And now while  I think of it, I have two requests to make of President Young  The first is that he will particularly instruct all Elders who  come to this land to see me first before they go into the field  and hearken to my counsel and cooperate with me in all  things in the vineyard (you will see the reason of this request when  you have read the whole of this communcation) and also that  you will notify me who have received their endowment and  who have not. And the next very important request is, that 
 Their original form. They use Greenleaf's Arithmetic, & Welds English Grammar   The main publishers of the mentioned works Are sand Sanborn & Carter of Portland   Maine. They have three steam presses in operation & have all they can do, they are   introducing those works not ownly in the old states But New ones such as Texas, Arkansas &c  & wish to introduce them into the New Territories. They called upon me & made inquiries  concerning the probable population of the valley. They conversed with me much upon the subject  & wished to make you a present of a copy of their works for your Examination, esspecially  the readers, which they forwarded to me & I forward them to you according to their  requst. I forward 13 Books As A present from them. four Towns Readers, Towns  speller & definer, Three sizes of Greenleaf' Arithmetic & one Key, Towns Analysis, Welds  parsing Book & Grammar, And Weld' Latin Lesson & Reader. I also foward with  them, The report of the board of Education in the State of Maine, Laws  statury [statutory] to public schools in the State of Maine, And the report of  the superintending school committee of Jay. My motive in forwarding the things is  that peradventure there may be sumthing gleaned out of them that may be  of some benefit to the Saints in their School Arangements.    Mr Carter said that should you feel disposed to adopt the Towns Readers   into your schools, That they would furnish theym already made, at a low rate.  or send you A new set of sterrotype plates, to print them in the valley at a small  percentage A thousand, or if we felt disposed to take them in the printed sheet, they would let  us have them cheaper than we could do the press work in the valley, unless we had steam presses  the printed sheeets would come to but little more by the ream or token than than the blank paper  I conversed with them upon all these points. They would deliver the Books or printed sheets  well packed in Boxes at New Orleans, free of charge ^for freight^ at any place we should direct. I  do not know as you will feel disposed to Enter into any arangement of the kind whatever  yet I felt it my duty to obtain all information I could upon this subject & all   others whare any benefit could be derived from it for the general good of the Church  The following is an extract of a letter from Mr Carter to me upon the subject    Mr Woodruff    We send you a few Books for examination All of which we make except the  Arithmetics. Our Books are better made than any others in the United States and so known. if  your people like them we should be glad to furnish them. We will sell you 1000 each of the   readers, spellers, Grammars, parcing Books, Analysis, & Arithmetics, for 50 per cent or half the following  trade or retail prices, for introduction & After introduction, for 40 percent disct delivered in  New Orleans without charge for freight. 
 Cambridgeport Mass Feb 15th 1849    To President Young And Council,    Beloved Brethren,    As an opportunity is presenting itself for me to forward  A communication to you in the spring Mail by private conveyance, I feel it my  duty to improve it by giving you an account of my stewardship, and of affairs  in these Eastern lands. I left the Saints in Pottawatamie Co Ioway on the 21st of June with  my family to procede by land to the Mississippi River. I held A meeting in company with Elder O.  Hyde with the Saints, at Mount Pisgah, Appointed A new Presiding Elder, & Council, Had a good  meeting, & left all parties Apparently satisfyed. I Also held A meeting with Elder Kington &   the Saints At garden Grove And had A pleasant time with them. On the 5th July while on my  Journey I drove my carriage into the dooryard of Br James Williams to spend the night I tied  my multes to A large sound oak tree in A lot on the opposite side of the road. As I was  about to retire to bed in my carriage with my family as usual, A still small voice whispered to  me in in An intelligent manner And told me to remove my Mules and carriage from whare they  were, I looked Around And could see no danger: yet I done As the spirit told me, tied my  Mules in A little groves, And moved mey waggon some rods And set it beside the House, And retired  to bed: but had not been there but few moments before A whirlwind struck us, And tore  the oak tree from its foundation And it came thundering to the Earth, And the main body of  it fell length ways whare ymy carriage stood, which had it not have been moved would probably  have been crushed to the Earth, And myself And family killed, Also the Mules. But through the  mercy of God we were all saved, for which blessing I felt to offer up the gratitude of my heart.  It was A striking proof of the benefits to be derived from harkning to the teachings of that still  small voice. On Sunday the 9th July in company with Brs John Snider & Dana, I went on to the  roof of the Temple in Nauvoo, And had A view of that once flourishing but now desolate city.  The people were in quite A state of Excitement from A report in circulation that Elder Hyde  was to preach in the Temple on that day's many came in waggons from the country to hear A  Preach or have a fight, it Appeared to be all the same with them. But Br Hyde had given out no  appointment. And their was no fighting, And no Preaching, Except what I done to A single individual  who had come As A deligate, from some People living in Mishigan on his way to Council Bluffs to  investigate Mormonishm, who professed to be ready to embrace truth wharever they could find it  I preached to him one hour, then Baptized him, confirmed him, (in George A Smith' House) and  ordained him An Elder, gave him A licence And what council I could. He got A Book of  Mormon, Doctrins And Covenants, And went home again. I got A letter from him soon after He  got home saying that A number of his friends were believing the truth. On the 16th July Sabbath   I met with the Saints At St Louis And Herd Elder Hyde deliver A discourse upon the subject  of the Resurrection. I spoke A short time in the after noon they had A good place of worship

It is not for me   to council you But I would ask if it would not be well   for you to come direct to Boston, get the letter & hold a council   in some way, things are still vary critical in the west, we do not   know whare it will End. I spent the Sabbath here spoke three times   comforted the Saints what I could, had a good time, the Saints   bear the shock well. I am well & in good spirits I do not know   whare I can get a letter to you, shall write to Lowell, Peterboro   & Bradford hopeing to reach you in one of these places I shall   go immediately go to Farmington New Haven Ct & New York  If you wish to write to me Direct to Farmington Ct  Yours in the kingdom of God    Wilford Woodruff 
 shall we put down the Provo new carpet  on the First floor main room?    The stoves which were borrowed  for use last winter are still in the Tem-  ple, though some of them will probably  be called for by the owners for next  winter use, shall we put them up after  the Temple is cleaned?    If you desire that the ceremonial  work shall not be stopped Brother Mc  Allister says he is willing to stay and  attend to it.    We shall be pleased to learn your  mind on the points named, as  early as may be convenient to  you, either by telegram or by letter.    Your family here well and all  wish to be most kindly remembered.    Last Friday we buried Sister  Matilda Moody wife to Bro Jno. M.  Moody she had been an invalid  for a long time.    The general health of the peo-  ple we are happy in stating 
 Sister Mary Bigelow has been a very sick  woman for several days and still continues  so.    The sickness among the people referred  to in our letter of 5th May has abated to   a considerable extent, but quite a number  are still complaining.    The Presidency of the Stake are still hold-  ing meetings to combine the mechanics. Since  our last writing the Stone Masons and Cutters,  Adobie layers, Quarrymen, Adobe makers, Lime  Burners and Plasterers, and Mason tenders &c.  have joined the Woodworkers and Painters,  previously organized; the entire combination form-  ing a "Builders' Union of St George." Nothing further  has been done, since our last letter, in organiz-  ing the tanners and leather workers.    Brother MacAllister and his counselors start  on the 15th of this month to visit Pine Valley,  Pinto, Hebron, and Panacca Wards, and ex-  pect to be back on the 30th.    Price City has been organized as a Branch  with Wm Lang as Presiding Elder and has been  attached to the 2nd Ward of St George. 
 My wife' Father Aged 76 & 3 days when He was Baptized, Mrs  Woodruff rejoiced & praised the Lord that she had lived  to have the privilege to wait upon her aged Fathr  to the waters of Baptism. His doors were opened to the  Twelve in their first Mission to Main^e^ & have been open  evry since. He has always been friendly from the time He  herd the work the Old Gentleman is smart & walked to the  top of Bunker Hill Monument with me 222 feet high & down  as spry apparently as any of us, A Son of Sister Foss my  Nephew who was visiting with Father Carter was also baptized  one of that Number Baptized was a learned intelligent  Gentleman from Sweeden Sweeden since we baptized him  He has the spirit of God upon him, & feels the importance of  this work hand has a great desire to visit his Native  country & proclaim these glad tidings unto them  but He wishes to visit the valley first which I have  councilled him to do I think He will yet be a usful  man in his Nation but He is willing to wait untill  the Lord & his servants say go. Another Individual who  gave in his name for Baptism an ownly put it off  untill He could visit his family who were out of town  &as He wish to bring his wife with him Was a Philosipher on  what Christians would call an Infidel. He had never met  with any sect or religion, but what He could desect or  overthrow, as He thought & hearing of my meetings He came  to try his touch stone to Mormonism, expecting to be able  to manage it the same as He had done evry thing els  after spending a few evenings with me investigating our principles,  reading our works, hearing us preach, and closely scanning  Orson pratts work, Entitled was Joseph Smith sent of God.  He had to Exclaim I am used up, I have run against a stump,  I am in water I cannot fathom. I little thought when I began this job  of taking A peep into Mormonism that I so soon had got to bcome A Christain  And acknowledge Christ, but acknowled so it is. I am in the net & must  become a Latter Day Saint, or take a stand against reason, Judgment  good sense and my faith. He is now a firm Believer in the work. 
 wish to give him any council upon this subject which may  be contrary to your mind & will, on what the spirit of God  ma Dictate. I expet He will be in St George soon and if you  should see him please give him such council upon this subject  as you may think best.    My respects to yourself & family, Brother George A., Brigham Jr  Brother Snow & all Enquring friends    Yours in the Gospel of Chist    W.

And if the presidency should feel disposed   to adopt any particular class of Books say Towns   Readers or any others & their could be means   raised from any sourse to purchase a few thousand of them And a way to get   them to the valley that it would be an immediate benifit to the children  & youth; Yet I do not consider it to be my place Neither do I feel dispose to  attempt to council you upon this or any other subject that I speak of, ownly   to lay them before you for your consideration, then let them be   governed by your counsel & Direction. I am picking up some maps, charts,   Histories &c which I have not an opportunity of forwarding at this time    Wilford Woodruff    PS. The thought suggests to my mind that should you think proper to have   some of these books brought to the valley, that if Capt Russel or any man who   is going to the valley with means might buy a quantity & take with him & sell   them at a reasonable price there    Since I wrote this letter I have forwarded the package of school Books to Brother   Jesse Haven Directed to President Brigham Young 
 for the Lord's sake and mine and for the general good of the cause  you will entirely put a stop to all Elders bringing hundreds of  letters with them to this country. it has been wholly through the  mercy of God that we have not been entirely ruined by it. This  Government are altering many of their laws and drawing the reins  very tight on many things and this is one of them: it matters  not whether letters are sealed or unsealed or whether there be  any directions or address upon them or whether they are open in  sheets in a portfolio or done up it is all the same. if there  be a sheet of writing of any kind except what directly concerns  the individual himself, it is £5 or 25 dollars fine for every such  piece of paper and there is no getting away from it. Brother Fielding  and others escaped only with the skin of their teeth. If an Elder  should be caught with 200 letters about his person or in his trunk,  nothing could save him. Neither we nor himself could pay the  fine. Imprisonment or transportation would be the result, besides  ruining us. for if they knew this was done by one of our society  their vengeance would be heaped on our heads. I have made  this or similar statements in several letters to Nauvoo but it  seems to have no effect, however. I pray that this may suffice.  All Elders that receive letters should put them all into the Letter  bag when they come to the ship. I do not ask any man to  send any letter to me only what comes through the post. I  had much rather pay the postage than endanger the cause  of God. I got damned the other day, enough to sinke a 120-  gun-ship, in getting Brother Taylor's Times and Seasins through  the custom House merely because they were Mormon papers.    I received, for the first time, yesterday—The Proclamation  of the Twelve Apostles of the Church of Christ to the Kings and  Rulers of the Nations of the Earth. It is truly a solemn proclam-  ation and I consider it will be to the Kingdoms of the Gentiles,  the same as "Mene, Mene, Tekel, Upharsin" to Belshazzar. I see  that I am to give it as wide a circulation as possible through-  out these dominions (I suppose this request was made, of course, by  your counsel) so I shall endeavour to attend to it. what the  effect will be in this government, time must determine. some  think this Government will notice it and turn their persecutions  upon us. But, be it so. The Lord God has spoken and I will  obey. The Presidency have counselled and I will give heed, if  it cost me my life. The Kings, Lords, Rulers and Rich among  the Gentiles shall never have it to say in the Day of Judgment  that they were hindered from having an invitation to the Great  Feast and marriage supper of the lamb because Wilford  Woodruff was ^afraid^ of his life. No. God forbid I would rather  go to the Scafford or the guillotine. My voice is—Let the  Kings and princes hear the word of the Lord and the solemn  proclamation of the Twelve Apostles of the Lamb whether they  will hear ofr forbear, then, if they reject it, they will be left   without excuse in the day of the judgments of God Almighty, and  if I were to fall in such a cause, I could fall in no better,  and it would sweeten death to know that I had assisted in  giving this great proclamation and invitation to the Gentile  world, thereby fulfilling the commands of God and assisting  to prepare the way for the coming of the Son of Man and the  Redemption of Man and Israel. truly there are solemn and  important events approaching theis generation in which we  live and "For Zion's sake I will not hold my peace and for  Jerusalem's sake I will not rest until the light thereof go forth  as brightness and their salvation as a lamp that burneth"    I think I can get the work published in Hebrew among  the Jewes. I shall do what I can to spread it abroad.    You spoke of visiting this country. I shall be truly glad  to see you at any time. I feel my labours and responsibilities  very great at the present time. I rejoice that we share in your  prayers and the prayers of all the Lord's anointed. Remember us  to the Twelve and all who inquire after us. Mrs Woodruff wishes  to be remembered to all. I still remain your friend and brother in the Truth  W. Woodruff.
