 among his general remarks he stated that he wouldbe very thankful if he could once more speak to thepeople in Nauvoo. I was rather surprised at such a remark,but had no idea of the sequel, or I should have beenmore particular to rem^em^ber his conversation. I however triedto rally him from his apparent gloom and dispondencyfeelings, and told him I had confidence that he would yetspeak to his brethren many times in Nauvoo; he thankedme for my remarks, and my efforts; my motives heof course perfectly understood.On the next morning, the 27th it was ascertainedthat the Governor was preparing to leave for the city, aswas already intimated, and that the trial had been postponedto suit the occasion; not fearing any danger at hand I sug-gested to the prophet, that unless he desired me to remainwith them that day, I should like to also go to the cityto witness the proceedings there, and again return to seethe thing out in Carthage during the trial. Both he and Hiramapproved of my going, and in addition gave me a mission toassist Bro. C. H. Wheelock, whom they had already dispatched to no-tify a number of witnesses to attend the coming trial. To providefor my safety to Nauvoo, I procured a pass from the Governorthrough the jailor; this pass I have had for years in my possession,but is now mislaid or entirely lost. I followed the troopsat some distance, not wishing to travel with them; was intime to hear the Governor deliver to a large assembly one of themost scandalous and outragous and untruthful speeches that couldwell be fabricated. This ended, I made a flying visit to myfamily for the night; and at the break of day next morning,as I was arranging to start on my mission, a startling cry wasover

 Now if Mr N Fielding and Clark have neglect-ed to settle these things, according to agreement, it iswilful neglect on their part, or at least on thepart of Br Fielding, as he had money enough to do it with. But if on the other hand, they havedone what I have paid them for doing, then thefamilies claiming passage on ac. of money had byme is all a fraud or forgery. and in either caseit is both unjust, and unreasonable, and unlookedfor by me. I owe nobody in Eng, for anything but Mr Brown for the flour, and that I Expected the office had settled years ago.I appeal to Elder Ward, for testimony that I wasvery particular in settleing every thing in a fairand honerable way with the office, and that I g[ave]an exact [and] particular account, of all who ha[ve]deposited money to go to america with, and made arrangements for it to be met, and paid it over insettlement with El's Fielding, Clark, and Ward.I mistrust there is something very wrong, or neglectfulsome where, and perhaps Elder Ward, will know where the wrong or neglect lies.On the subject of a Box of hardware sent to me fromLiverpool to sell, the duties are fifty Dollars, and thesame articles selling in New York at one half the pricemarked in the Bill. I have not the first picaune,to pay the duties, nor even to by a pare of trousers, orto pay a barber for shaving me. I have men in debtfor my passage clothing and other expences about a hun-dred and fifty dollars since I left home.

 New York Dec. 26th 1845Dear Brother Woodruff. With a very bad penand in great haste, I imbrace the opportunitythat this evening to answer your kind letter, whichvery unexpectedly came to hand this morning.The Saints in the eastern country are all alivein the cause of gathering across the mountainsmoreso so than they have been heretofore ingathering to Nauvoo. I have heard nothingsaid by the Twelve concerning what coursewould be persued by the saints in England, nei-ther of your stay or return, but I pre-sume it will be much cheeper for thesaints their to emigrate by water—for itis a great deal cheeper for the easternsaints to emigrate from here by water andof course it will be for you. I have chartereda Bark of 450 tons for $6000. I shalltake about 200 tons ^of^ freight for the sanSandwich Islands at 16 dollars per tonwhich will reduce the expence about toabout 3800 say four 4000 dollarsI shall carry about 126^5^ saints with me,which will be more ^less^ than one half of theexpence than going by land.

Ithink it must have occurred 1825 and 1830. Ishould think about the month of September betweenthe hours of 6 and 9 o'clk. in the evening.We saw a very large army of Soldiers (to allappearance) marching in the firmament, coming froma North Westerly direction and meeting a similar armyfrom a South Easterly direction, nearly over our heads.We were standing at the West door of my father's houseand saw the army from the North West most distinctlyand saw the front of the opposite army also.We saw them march up and apparently dischargefirearms and I am almost sure that I saw theflash of the same, and probably heard the report, butbeing but a child, and it being about 55 years ago,I would not like to be too positive as to hearing

 Ogden Utah May 31st 1896President Wilford WoodruffSalt Lake City UtahDear Brother:Some months ago Bro E. T. Wooleyof this city handed to you a letter writtenby me Nov 28 [18]95; regarding a memorial archand Pioneer square in Salt Lake city; without any Explaination; Said you was verrybusy at the time; ^I^ was verry sorry he did notexpain my position; I gave Bro Wooley the manuscript& with it my reasons for sending a copy to you, hetook off two copyes in duplicate, one he sendt tome & the other he took to you. There is a slight mistakeor two in the Type written copiys; After writingthis article; my wife read it over to me thefirst time, after reading it she said, Pa youaught to send that to President Woodruff!At the same instant, the same feeling came uponme. Soon after this my Brother in Law BishopWhite ^Brothers^ Jos Parry & David M Stewart calledin to see me. I let them read the article 
 I wish also to state that I have at different times heardmy Father Asahel Perry state that he was at Kirtland O.to visit the Prophet at the time that the first Council wascalled in relation to building the Temple in that place.Aaron C. Lyon had accompanied my Father from our residence in Genesee Co. N. Y. to Kirtland O.  Joseph invi-ted them to attend the Council, and after opening the samehe presented the business of building the Temple to thepeople convened, and then called upon those present for anexpression of their feelings.  When most of the brethren pres-ent seemed to feel that the Church was too poor to builda building of the magnitude required, and thought theyhad better build something smaller and less expensive.During the discussion Father Lyon and my Father, step'dto one side and conferred together as to whether theyhad any money to spare for this purpose, and havesufficient left to take them home. They concludedthey could spare a trifle each. They returned and pre-sented (if my memory serves me right) A. C. Lyon $10.00Asahel Perry $5.00 Whereupon Joseph arose (and asmy Father said) spoke in a very energetic manner sayingthe work had commenced and the House would be builtaccording to the pattern presented.In the month of May1836 we moved to Kirtland and bought a farm. Sometime after many of the Saints being in very distressedcircumstances, my Father gave to Joseph $10000 inmoney for the benefit of the poor.

After several daysof anxiety &c they died Oct 4th and 5th.  This hasbeen the severest trial of my life. It seemed from thefirst that they were to go As nothing we could do seemedto benefit them in the least. Truly the Lord had adesign in taking them away. I feel to recognise Hishand and our only hope is That we may proveourselves worthy to receive them in morning of thefirst resurrection. I have had quite a serioustime with my wife as they were all she had. Howevershe is becoming more reconciled. The recent visit of ourbeloved Sister Zina Young seems to have done hera great deal of good. However I dont wish to

 Philadelphia  April 19th 1846Dear Br W. WoodruffI arrived here yesterday afternoon to assist in organizing the Branch of the Church &c.here as Elder Lutz leaves with his family on Wednesday next for the West. I had purposed of comingtoo, But circumstances, has seemed to place me otherwise. You know of Mothers sickness, as you heard in Philadephia. She is confined to her Room at my houseyet, but she is getting better, but she has not beenable to move, neither can I tell at present whenshe will be. I have lost a neice 24 years old ( Ibelieve or more) and also a Brother—the niece was buried the thirsday before I left you in Philadephiaand my Brothers funeral I attended last thirsdayBoth died in a few minutes after they were too hear; and what is worst of all, had never obeyedthe Gospel. We durst not let Mother know it underher present weak circumstances. Therefore under the present existing affairs I do not know, when I shall get started. If not son, I shall endeavor to assistElder Little in getting up a ship. As I havereceived a letter from Br Hyde since I sawyou telling me that is what they wish me to do, andto go my whole length and breadth in gettingout a compay to follow Elder Brannan. Ihave wrote back, to Br Hyde, giving him a detail of my proceedings as I informed you

The union now has a mem-bership of about 125, and the officers claimthat the members of the orchestra areabout the only musicians in the city whohave not come into the fold. The DuffOpera company will play an engagement atthe theatre this week and it is stated the orchestra will have to be enlarged for theoccasion. The union officers say no mem-ber of the union will be permitted to play and there are on other available musicians in the city.Mr. Burton treats the matter very lightlyand says he does not know yet that he willbe required to increase his orchestra, but ifit is necessary he anticipates no trouble.It is a matter of no concern to him whetherthe members of his orchestra join theunion or not.

We arrived inMo. in June 1838 but were driven from our homes inDavis Co. in Nov. following, and subsequently in Feb.1839 we were expelled from the state in the general exo-dus of the Church. Subsequently at the first Con-ference held at Commerce (afterwards Nauvoo) in thefall of 1839 he gave up his obligation against the Churchconsecrating the same thereto. From this time forward he managed to live without becominga charge to any considerable extent upon any bodyexcept myself.  This I also submit for yourconsideration.Yours in the Gospel CovenantStephen C. Perry

 TO THE SAINTS SCATTERED ABROAD—GREETING:BELOVED BRETHREN AND FRIENDS:After so long a time, we have heard direct from Elder LYMAN WIGHT, and have learned his whereabouts. He is in Texas, and I thinkon one of the tributaries of the Colorado River, about seventy five miles from the city of Austin. He has addressed a pamphlet of sixteenpages to the Latter Day Saints, scattered abroad, and to every body else, containing his appeals to them, and the cogitations of his own mind.If the Lord had inspired him to write his appeal, it would have been received with respect and cordiality. But it would seem that hisinspiration came from no higher source than George Miller. He speaks much about being put out of his place and some one also called to fillit. If this had been contemplated, and even carried into effect, the Council of the Church would not have gone beyond their power and right, ifthey had thought it necessary to be done: But to reproach the person supposed to occupy his place with the appellation of "A LONG EARED JACKASS," is but to reproach the Council by whom he was appointed, if appointed at all. The spirit of alienation and jealousy is too apparent in hiswritings: No person has been suggested to fill his place, to my knowledge; and if he had been dictated by the Spirit of the Lord, he would havewritten a confidential letter to the Council of his brethren, and enquired into all these matters, before venturing to throw out such a volley of mostextravagant and uncalled for language as his pamphlet contains. But it seems that he has taken Bishop Miller for his prompter, who lost theSpirit of the Lord by his over anxiety to run forward to Grand Island, to Punkand, and to "Bullyhuck," that he might show himself a littlesmarter man than any other in the camp: and when the Spirit of the Lord had left him, he learned that the Twelve were not right, and resolvedto follow them no longer, when the truth was, he never would follow, but always run ahead. He left the body of the Church without counseland without the fellowship of the Saints.If Bro. Wight had been as anxious to keep up a friendly intercourse and correspondence with the Church and Council, and maintain a perma-nent union and alliance with them, as he now is to sow the seeds of dissension, by scattering his pamphlets among the OUTER BRANCHES of theChurch, could he not long ago have sent a messenger to hunt us up, as well as to send one now to distribute his pamphlets, the products of hisown misguided zeal, breathing manifestly the spirit of separation from the Church and Council? If we were broken up and gone from Nauvoo,we were not gone out of the world. The very spirit of his apology for not writing to us, clearly shows that he lacked more the inclination towrite than the opportunity of sending a letter. This is in accordance with some expressions of his concerning his desire to be accounted as oneof the Twelve on his leaving Nauvoo. It may be proper, at some time, to note them.He appeals to those of like ordination with himself to know if they have any power or authority given them to remove him from his station.For one, I can say that I have been ordained to all the power and authority that Bro. Wight ever was, and I can inform him that he is not yet sohigh that the voice of the Council cannot reach him and bring him down, and even put another in his place if they deem it necessary. SidneyRigdon was ordained to all that Bro. Wight ever was, and rather more, but the arm and voice of God's Council brought him down and dried upthe fountain of his spirits. Lucifer was even higher than Bro. Wight, yet he was thrust down by those with whom he stood connected: and beit known, and known to all, that the Council has power to expel any member of its body from the same, when that member ceases to act pursu-ant to its dictates. If this be not a true doctrine, Lucifer could have stood his ground in heaven and bid as loudly defiance to the powers there, asBro. Wight has in his pamplet to all the powers of the world, the Church, Angels and men. But the former was cast down, and the Council atthe Salt Lake City, with the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, must determine the portion of the latter after having canvassed his pamphlet andconsidered it in connection with this circular.Why does Bro. Wight teach and enforce a doctrine that Joseph Smith never did nor never would sanction? Namely: a community of goods,or property thrown in together as common stock. Though this doctrine has sometimes been practiced by good men, but the original purpose anddesign of God was to make men accountable for their stewartship, and therefore, "to one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; and to every man according to his several ability." The whole course and order of nature—the constitutional organization of man—the voiceof the martyred prophet of the last days, and the eternal purpose of God, all stand opposed to Bro. Wight's "common stock" principles; and nopeople can prosper that enforce this as a law among themselves. I call not upon Heaven and Earth, Angels and men for my "indemnity," butlet my communications be yea, yea, and nay, nay; and leave the remainder to Bro. Lyman.With regard to keys and priesthood, Bro. Wight is just as lame as he is about the power not existing to displace him, and one day it willmeet him in the face; and though I am a fool, there ARE men in this Church that can measure his bushel in their peck without shaking down orpressing it together. Men have done something here besides wearing fine clothes, and have learned something better and more generous than tothrow out any such low insinuations.When men get a mission according to their own hearts' desires in answer to long and repeated importunities, they ought not to murmur orcomplain at their hardships if they even have "to sell their last coat for food." It was a work craved because of an apparent unwillingness toremain with the Council and fare as they did, receive the chastisements and corrections which they did, and thus become perfected in the midstof counsel. Israel once received a king because of their great murmurings and importunities, but was he a blessing or a curse to them? It issaid not to be the nature of "the wild ram of the mountains" to herd in the domestic fold, and if it does not yet appear that Joseph Smith gave toLyman Wight his great mission with a similar motive to that with which the Lord gave a soul to Israel, I will confess my mistake.The Churches are exhorted to continue their emigration and in the discharge of their various duties, as counselled and directed in the lateGeneral Epistle of the Twelve, and pay no attention to Bro. Wight's call until it is sanctioned by the First Presidency of the Church, at the SaltLake City, and also by the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. Bro. Wight may collect around him the whole phalanx of wild, disaffected and in-dependent spirits, even from the "Pagan Prophet" down to the "Brewster Seer." But these combustible materials, gathered together, renderexplosion more certain and its consequences more destructive. None of us are at war with Bro. Wight's mission, but with his boasting and de-fying spirit.The next circular that I issue, I hope may come from our own press at Council Bluffs, under the head of the "FRONTIER GUARDIAN."Now, Brethren, farewell! May the blessing of Him who died and rose again from the dead, be with you always and keep you steadfast andimmovable in the truth, and guide your steps to the celestial city where the Saints meet in peace.With great respect, I have the honor to be,Your brother in the Bonds of the Covenant,ORSON HYDE. 
 Cambridgeport Mass Feb 24th 1849President Young & Council,Dear Brethren,Since I have been travelling in this eastern country which is so Highly famed for the education of their children, I have endeavoured to bear in mind that portion of the epistle which councils the Saints, "To secure at least A copy of Evry valuable treatise on Education" &c, &c. I have reflected much upon this subject, & the situation of the Saints in the valley, the thousands of children that will be congregated there. And not ownly the importance of their having school Books to read & learn from, but the importance of their having such Books as will attract their attention, and be adapted to the capacity of children, & youth. Also of intro-ducing a class of Books that will be accepted & recommended by the Presidency ora Board of Education which they may appoint, as their would be a great Benefit derived in Having a uniformity of school Books introduced throughout the schools of the Latter day Saints. I have not supposed that the Saints would vary materially from the world in introducing the first rudiments of education into their schools, ownly to make the best selection they could. The Saints would of course differ from the world & Christendom in their religious teaching which in some measure would be a seperate branch from teaching the common branches of education.It has been under this view of the subject that I have taken pains to investigate the present system of education in New England, And obtain copies of some maps, charts, Books &c and thereport of their board of education. The State of Maine & others are making great improvements in their system of education, introducing new modes of teaching, using the Black board, making New school Houses upon a New plan, ventilatingat the top of the windows, making pleasure grouds &c &c. A copy of the drafts I forward to you with this letter which you will find is a Book entitled Report of the Board of Education of the State of 1847. A New series of Books are now being introduced through the U. S. which are prefered before all others they were got up by a company of Men in the city of Portland Maine by A board of Education which was composed (it was said) of the best talent, of the country, who collected a copy of all the works in use in the United States,and out of them & their own branes formed the Books. The name of the Readers 1, 2, 3, 4, Are called Town's Also the speller and Definer, and Analysis. His name was given to them as He was the author of much of their contents: yet the Board made great Alterations from

 Philadelphia April 5th 1849President Young & CouncilDear BrethrenAs near two monthshave passed away since I wrote my other letters I thought Iwould add a little more before they go. two companies ofSaints are preparing to leave the Eastern States for the west& will start in few days. Those at Boston & East & Northof there rendezvous at Worcester &Mass & go with Br Haven viaof Abany, Buffalo, Chicago & St. Louis to the Bluffs, but I thinkthat company will be small, those at New Haven New York& philadelphia &c Start from Phil & are led lead by ElderAppleby will take the Southern route about 50 will go fromthe philadelphia Brach. Since I last wrote I have observedwherever I have traveld & preached, A revival of the Spirit ofEnquiry & investigation of the principles of the Latter Day Saints& feeling after the Gospel of Jesus Christ by that portion of com-munity who are honest in heart & are reflecting upon the signsof the times which are now developing themselves before the Eyes ofthis generation in fulfillment of ancient and modern prophecy& the Revelations of Jesus Christ. It is true this class are like thegleaning of grapes after the vintage is done, few when compared withthe mass, yet with them I find at the present time the strongfoundations of their prejudice against our cause is giving awaythey are candidly enquiring after our principles religion & welfare& in a good number of instances are Embracing the work, asan Exh example I will say that before I came here I spentseveral weeks with my family in Cambridgeport during whichtime I held meetings on the Sabbath & weekday evenings inmy own hired house & those of my Brethern & we had fullhouses, & many began to investigate & some strong minded men& the result was we Baptized 8 in few days & as many more areready for the water, when I left, among those which I Baptizedwas A Mr Snow & Lady that attended with Br Whipple Also

I thank the Lord myhealth is much improved now, though someof the saints say I look very thin and pale yet.

 Stanley Buildings, Bath StLiverpool, Oct. 1st 1845President Brigham YoungBeloved Brother and President in theKingdom of God, whom I love of a truth for the Truth's sakethat dwelleth in you. I seat myself once more in thislife to make an address to you with pen and ink. I havenow lying before me three letters from you of dates—Feb'y 11th(by A. Fielding) June 27th and lastly August 21st for all of whichfavors I feel thankful; for you may rest assured they operateupon my spirit like a live coal from off the altar and kindlesa flame in my soul. I feel to magnify the name of Godfor the manner he has sustained, inspired and upheld you sincethe death of Joseph and Hyrum and the way he is giving asignal victory to the citizens of Zion the city of Joseph. I lookupon it myself, as a great omen and evidence that the timehas come to favour Zion, and that her Sun and Light must andshall speedily go forth propelled by the spirit and strength ofthe God of Israel, until Zion arises with all her strength, power,Beauty and Glory until she fully accomplishes all that the ancientprophets anticipated; yea: I rejoice in the prosperity of all, of whichyour letters speak. My prayers have ascended day and nightbefore God that he would not only do by His servant BrighamYoung as he did by Joshua of old after the death of Mosesbut that he would do as much better by him as the greatnesslabour and work of this dispensation required. [##Joshua 1:1-9##] I havealso remembered all the Twelve and Elders in all the world.I thank you for all the information and instruction you havegiven me and of so often speaking of our only son in Zion. We are all well at present. Our youngest son is two months old, thelargest and healthiest child we ever had of his age. All isgoing on as well as can be expected in this country consideringall thinges. the few wise labourers &c. Elder Jones I think isdoing well in Wales; he has laboured faithfully and sownmuch seed that is now taking root and beginning to bringforth much fruit; within a few days past they have baptizedtwo Campbellite Evangelists or ministers and they are ordainedpriests (I ordained one of them) and a prospect of their doing muchgood. Brother Jones has preached very extensively in the largestcities and towns through the Welsh domains, and said, therewere nearly a hundred added to the branches in that landa few weeks before he left to pay me a visit.I have held on to what few American Elders there are inthis land according to your request except Elders Holmesand Hardy from George Town, Masss—they had settled theiraffairs and were about ready to sail when your letter arrived,and Elder Hardy's family is in such a situation, he is obligedto go home so I did not stop them. But I think we can holdour own until some help comes from Nauvoo. The company ofsome Elders from there as soon as they get their endowment willmeet with a welcome reception in this land. And now whileI think of it, I have two requests to make of President YoungThe first is that he will particularly instruct all Elders whocome to this land to see me first before they go into the fieldand hearken to my counsel and cooperate with me in allthings in the vineyard (you will see the reason of this request whenyou have read the whole of this communcation) and also thatyou will notify me who have received their endowment andwho have not. And the next very important request is, that 
 Their original form. They use Greenleaf's Arithmetic, & Welds English Grammar The main publishers of the mentioned works Are sand Sanborn & Carter of Portland Maine. They have three steam presses in operation & have all they can do, they are introducing those works not ownly in the old states But New ones such as Texas, Arkansas &c& wish to introduce them into the New Territories. They called upon me & made inquiriesconcerning the probable population of the valley. They conversed with me much upon the subject& wished to make you a present of a copy of their works for your Examination, esspeciallythe readers, which they forwarded to me & I forward them to you according to theirrequst. I forward 13 Books As A present from them. four Towns Readers, Townsspeller & definer, Three sizes of Greenleaf' Arithmetic & one Key, Towns Analysis, Weldsparsing Book & Grammar, And Weld' Latin Lesson & Reader. I also foward withthem, The report of the board of Education in the State of Maine, Lawsstatury [statutory] to public schools in the State of Maine, And the report ofthe superintending school committee of Jay. My motive in forwarding the things isthat peradventure there may be sumthing gleaned out of them that may beof some benefit to the Saints in their School Arangements.Mr Carter said that should you feel disposed to adopt the Towns Readers into your schools, That they would furnish theym already made, at a low rate.or send you A new set of sterrotype plates, to print them in the valley at a smallpercentage A thousand, or if we felt disposed to take them in the printed sheet, they would letus have them cheaper than we could do the press work in the valley, unless we had steam pressesthe printed sheeets would come to but little more by the ream or token than than the blank paperI conversed with them upon all these points. They would deliver the Books or printed sheetswell packed in Boxes at New Orleans, free of charge ^for freight^ at any place we should direct. Ido not know as you will feel disposed to Enter into any arangement of the kind whateveryet I felt it my duty to obtain all information I could upon this subject & all others whare any benefit could be derived from it for the general good of the ChurchThe following is an extract of a letter from Mr Carter to me upon the subjectMr WoodruffWe send you a few Books for examination All of which we make except theArithmetics. Our Books are better made than any others in the United States and so known. ifyour people like them we should be glad to furnish them. We will sell you 1000 each of the readers, spellers, Grammars, parcing Books, Analysis, & Arithmetics, for 50 per cent or half the followingtrade or retail prices, for introduction & After introduction, for 40 percent disct delivered inNew Orleans without charge for freight. 
 Cambridgeport Mass Feb 15th 1849To President Young And Council,Beloved Brethren,As an opportunity is presenting itself for me to forwardA communication to you in the spring Mail by private conveyance, I feel it myduty to improve it by giving you an account of my stewardship, and of affairsin these Eastern lands. I left the Saints in Pottawatamie Co Ioway on the 21st of June withmy family to procede by land to the Mississippi River. I held A meeting in company with Elder O.Hyde with the Saints, at Mount Pisgah, Appointed A new Presiding Elder, & Council, Had a goodmeeting, & left all parties Apparently satisfyed. I Also held A meeting with Elder Kington & the Saints At garden Grove And had A pleasant time with them. On the 5th July while on myJourney I drove my carriage into the dooryard of Br James Williams to spend the night I tiedmy multes to A large sound oak tree in A lot on the opposite side of the road. As I wasabout to retire to bed in my carriage with my family as usual, A still small voice whispered tome in in An intelligent manner And told me to remove my Mules and carriage from whare theywere, I looked Around And could see no danger: yet I done As the spirit told me, tied myMules in A little groves, And moved mey waggon some rods And set it beside the House, And retiredto bed: but had not been there but few moments before A whirlwind struck us, And torethe oak tree from its foundation And it came thundering to the Earth, And the main body ofit fell length ways whare ymy carriage stood, which had it not have been moved would probablyhave been crushed to the Earth, And myself And family killed, Also the Mules. But through themercy of God we were all saved, for which blessing I felt to offer up the gratitude of my heart.It was A striking proof of the benefits to be derived from harkning to the teachings of that stillsmall voice. On Sunday the 9th July in company with Brs John Snider & Dana, I went on to theroof of the Temple in Nauvoo, And had A view of that once flourishing but now desolate city.The people were in quite A state of Excitement from A report in circulation that Elder Hydewas to preach in the Temple on that day's many came in waggons from the country to hear APreach or have a fight, it Appeared to be all the same with them. But Br Hyde had given out noappointment. And their was no fighting, And no Preaching, Except what I done to A single individualwho had come As A deligate, from some People living in Mishigan on his way to Council Bluffs toinvestigate Mormonishm, who professed to be ready to embrace truth wharever they could find itI preached to him one hour, then Baptized him, confirmed him, (in George A Smith' House) andordained him An Elder, gave him A licence And what council I could. He got A Book ofMormon, Doctrins And Covenants, And went home again. I got A letter from him soon after Hegot home saying that A number of his friends were believing the truth. On the 16th July Sabbath I met with the Saints At St Louis And Herd Elder Hyde deliver A discourse upon the subjectof the Resurrection. I spoke A short time in the after noon they had A good place of worship

It is not for me to council you But I would ask if it would not be well for you to come direct to Boston, get the letter & hold a council in some way, things are still vary critical in the west, we do not know whare it will End.

Sinceour last writing the Stone Masons and Cutters,Adobie layers, Quarrymen, Adobe makers, LimeBurners and Plasterers, and Mason tenders &c.have joined the Woodworkers and Painters,previously organized; the entire combination form-ing a "Builders' Union of St George."

 My wife' Father Aged 76 & 3 days when He was Baptized, MrsWoodruff rejoiced & praised the Lord that she had livedto have the privilege to wait upon her aged Fathrto the waters of Baptism. His doors were opened to theTwelve in their first Mission to Main^e^ & have been openevry since. He has always been friendly from the time Heherd the work the Old Gentleman is smart & walked to thetop of Bunker Hill Monument with me 222 feet high & downas spry apparently as any of us, A Son of Sister Foss myNephew who was visiting with Father Carter was also baptizedone of that Number Baptized was a learned intelligentGentleman from Sweeden Sweeden since we baptized himHe has the spirit of God upon him, & feels the importance ofthis work hand has a great desire to visit his Nativecountry & proclaim these glad tidings unto thembut He wishes to visit the valley first which I havecouncilled him to do I think He will yet be a usfulman in his Nation but He is willing to wait untillthe Lord & his servants say go. Another Individual whogave in his name for Baptism an ownly put it offuntill He could visit his family who were out of town&as He wish to bring his wife with him Was a Philosipher onwhat Christians would call an Infidel. He had never metwith any sect or religion, but what He could desect oroverthrow, as He thought & hearing of my meetings He cameto try his touch stone to Mormonism, expecting to be ableto manage it the same as He had done evry thing elsafter spending a few evenings with me investigating our principles,reading our works, hearing us preach, and closely scanningOrson pratts work, Entitled was Joseph Smith sent of God.He had to Exclaim I am used up, I have run against a stump,I am in water I cannot fathom.

And if the presidency should feel disposed to adopt any particular class of Books say Towns Readers or any others & their could be means raised from any sourse to purchase a few thousand of them And a way to get them to the valley that it would be an immediate benifit to the children& youth; Yet I do not consider it to be my place Neither do I feel dispose toattempt to council you upon this or any other subject that I speak of, ownly to lay them before you for your consideration, then let them be governed by your counsel & Direction. I am picking up some maps, charts, Histories &c which I have not an opportunity of forwarding at this timeWilford WoodruffPS. The thought suggests to my mind that should you think proper to have some of these books brought to the valley, that if Capt Russel or any man who is going to the valley with means might buy a quantity & take with him & sell them at a reasonable price thereSince I wrote this letter I have forwarded the package of school Books to Brother Jesse Haven Directed to President Brigham Young 
 for the Lord's sake and mine and for the general good of the causeyou will entirely put a stop to all Elders bringing hundreds ofletters with them to this country. it has been wholly through themercy of God that we have not been entirely ruined by it. ThisGovernment are altering many of their laws and drawing the reinsvery tight on many things and this is one of them: it mattersnot whether letters are sealed or unsealed or whether there beany directions or address upon them or whether they are open insheets in a portfolio or done up it is all the same. if therebe a sheet of writing of any kind except what directly concernsthe individual himself, it is £5 or 25 dollars fine for every suchpiece of paper and there is no getting away from it. Brother Fieldingand others escaped only with the skin of their teeth. If an Eldershould be caught with 200 letters about his person or in his trunk,nothing could save him. Neither we nor himself could pay thefine. Imprisonment or transportation would be the result, besidesruining us. for if they knew this was done by one of our societytheir vengeance would be heaped on our heads. I have madethis or similar statements in several letters to Nauvoo but itseems to have no effect, however. I pray that this may suffice.All Elders that receive letters should put them all into the Letterbag when they come to the ship. I do not ask any man tosend any letter to me only what comes through the post. Ihad much rather pay the postage than endanger the causeof God. I got damned the other day, enough to sinke a 120-gun-ship, in getting Brother Taylor's Times and Seasins throughthe custom House merely because they were Mormon papers.I received, for the first time, yesterday—The Proclamationof the Twelve Apostles of the Church of Christ to the Kings andRulers of the Nations of the Earth. It is truly a solemn proclam-ation and I consider it will be to the Kingdoms of the Gentiles,the same as "Mene, Mene, Tekel, Upharsin" to Belshazzar. I seethat I am to give it as wide a circulation as possible through-out these dominions (I suppose this request was made, of course, byyour counsel) so I shall endeavour to attend to it. what theeffect will be in this government, time must determine. somethink this Government will notice it and turn their persecutionsupon us. But, be it so. The Lord God has spoken and I willobey. The Presidency have counselled and I will give heed, ifit cost me my life. The Kings, Lords, Rulers and Rich amongthe Gentiles shall never have it to say in the Day of Judgmentthat they were hindered from having an invitation to the GreatFeast and marriage supper of the lamb because WilfordWoodruff was ^afraid^ of his life. No. God forbid I would rathergo to the Scafford or the guillotine. My voice is—Let theKings and princes hear the word of the Lord and the solemnproclamation of the Twelve Apostles of the Lamb whether theywill hear ofr forbear, then, if they reject it, they will be left without excuse in the day of the judgments of God Almighty, andif I were to fall in such a cause, I could fall in no better,and it would sweeten death to know that I had assisted ingiving this great proclamation and invitation to the Gentileworld, thereby fulfilling the commands of God and assistingto prepare the way for the coming of the Son of Man and theRedemption of Man and Israel. truly there are solemn andimportant events approaching theis generation in which welive and "For Zion's sake I will not hold my peace and forJerusalem's sake I will not rest until the light thereof go forthas brightness and their salvation as a lamp that burneth"I think I can get the work published in Hebrew amongthe Jewes. I shall do what I can to spread it abroad.You spoke of visiting this country. I shall be truly gladto see you at any time. I feel my labours and responsibilitiesvery great at the present time. I rejoice that we share in yourprayers and the prayers of all the Lord's anointed. Remember usto the Twelve and all who inquire after us. Mrs Woodruff wishesto be remembered to all. I still remain your friend and brother in the TruthW. Woodruff.
