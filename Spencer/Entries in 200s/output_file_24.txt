There was no time to ask your advice ^for the university opened in a few days.^ and I took this liberty, for another reason he represented that he believed a new opening to preach the gospel ^among the students^ could be made and he strenuously advo- cated giving the educated classes a chance.

President Wilford Woodruff, Salt Lake City.  Dear Brother:  You may possible remember that on the last day of Cenference a brother from this town named Henry Lewis stepped up to the stand and spoke to you about his wife being sick, his name had been proposed as a missionary by the Liverpool office as a young man who would made a good missionary to the British Isles; he is one of our steadiest and best hands working on the Sugar Factory, and he had agreed when Lehi made up its subscription list for stock in the fFactory to put in $500.00, when he was called on this mission he had already paid $250.00 and he came to me and told me that if he could sell that stock that he had already paid and be realeased also from that, that he had agreed to pay that he would have enough means to go with, and his family could live in his absence. I told him that if he was really called that we would do our best to pay him the $250.00 that he had already paid.  His wife is now much better and he is ready to go in about two weeks if he is required to go, but I was quoting his case in the Directors met^e^ting in Brother James Jack's office on Tuesday evening last merely to show the difficulties that some times we have to contend against. wWhere people have agreed to take stock in the Factory and failed for some cause or other. It is va very tight time just now andd to be candid it is going to cripple us in this town to a certain extent both to part with him and also to have to pay him the money as we are having a very hard pull to do as we have agreed to, on account of lacks of funds amongst the people.  Bros. Thatcher and Grant who were at the Directors meeting felt that he ought to be released, and while I feel very delicate in asking such favors still I desire to present the case before you and if you could release him under these circumstances it would be a great favor to Lehi. I will say that he does not know any- thing of this letter. He is also one of the liveliest men we have got in collecting means for the Defence fund, and though I also ^but^ claim that I take pride in sending some of the most useful men we have from this Ward as missionaries. We have already four in the European mission and who are some of our best men.

It is not necessary for me to make a long story about the matter of your claim to the purchase of that piece of land.  I consider a bargain a bargain, and in all honesty and fairness the bargain which was made between you and Bp. Hunter should have been conplied with, and carried out; and that it was not, always did seem to me arbitrary and unjust to you.  I did all I could to provail upon Prest. Tay- lor to let you have the land as agreed be- tween Bp. Hunter and yourself, and while he never to my knowledge refused to do so, he persisted in putting it off and never, so far as I know, came to any conclusion about it. I have felt very sorry and chigrinned over it, to think that when the agreement was made in good faith, that any one should hesitate, or stand in the way of its fulfillment.

I received your telegraphic dispatch very late this evening and at once pro- ceed to reply. The Scenes of "Early Church History" which I have, are painted on can- vas (12 + 7 1/2 foot each) and I can therefore not send them. I have only two printed pictures: "Joseph Smith receiving the plates from the Angel Moroni" and "The Restoration of the Aaronic Priesthood," which I can send you by mail on Monday, if so desired, as ^but^ it is too late to-night.  But now, my beloved brethren, this your proposition gives me much anxiety and distress of mind, as it appears to me, that what you thus intend to do, is virtually taking the main support away from me and my family, and that too, at a time, when I badly can afford it.  I have lately returned from a mission, in which I have employed my means and abilities for the benefit of the Church, and I find, that the crops in this valley have failed, leaving us in a very poor fix.

You will no doubt recoll- ect that I have mentioned the matter several times to you and to the Council in the hope that Dr. Joseph's claims upon it by reason of an understanding and agreement had between Bp.

So far as my personal knowledge of the matter is concerned, I have been convinced from the start that there was a fair and square bargain made between Bp. E. Hunter and J. S. Richards in regard to that piece of land; but when it came before Prest. Taylor for settlement, as pr. the agreement with Bp Hunter, Prest. Taylor delayed and postponed the matter until circumstances changed and it became apparent to me it was no use pressing him further in regard to it.  I then advised Dr. Richards to wait awhile until a more favorable time should come, and I believed then he would get the land.  I think a bargain is a bargain, and it should be respected. If Bp. Hunter had no right to make a bargain with Dr. Richards, then both the Bp. and Dr. R. were laboring under a mistake.  I am fully persuaded that Bp.

At that time money was an object and land was not so much sought for, and that Bp. Hunter made the agreement at all, is proof that he did it in good faith and I never could tell why it was not, or ought not to be carried out in good faith.  The only reason I could give why it was not done is that Prest. Taylor had a habit of putting off almost everything of this kind indefinitely. I do not think Dr Richards has been dealt with fairly in the matter, not that I blame any body, I simply charge it to Prest. Taylor's habit of procrastination. I spoke to him many times about it, and while he never denied Joseph's claims or refused to ace- sed to them, he persisted in putting it off until I advised the Dr. to wait till some more favorable time.

It is an apparent fact that not enough of the youth of Utah are adopt- ing the mechanical trades as a means of livelihood, and as a consequence mechanics from other parts of the Country are filling the places that  could and should be occupied by our own people; which condition of af- fairs has been viewed with apprehension by some of those who have the material interests of the people of our Territory most at heart, and a remedy has been studied by them; the outgrowth of which is the contemp- lated opening of such an Academy as above referred to, with a Capital stock of $200,000.00 divided into 4000 shares of the par value of $50.00 per share.  It is hoped that all who are interested in the best advancement of our young people will subscribe for enough of the stock in said contemplated Company to effect an incorporation at once.
