Mr. Nelson was formerly in our employ, but left our services be- fore settling his debts, and went to Sweden to work as a missionary He wrote us from Sweden, an apology for so doing, but we think you will agree with us, this is not the proper way for men to pay their debts, and could not be used in licquidating any claims which we may have to pay. We believe Miss Glassford presented it to some of the officials who had charge of Mr. Nelson's work and they re- ferred her to you. Through a combination of circumstances iover which she had no controll, she was unable to see you at the time she expected, and hence we have thought it wise to drop you a note and present yout the bill. Miss Glassford has always spoken in highest terms of her treatment in Salt Lake City and has assured us many times that there would be no doubt of this obligation be- ing met as soon as it was placed before the proper authorities, and as we have exercised great patience in saying nothing of this matter for so long a time, we trust you will show your appre- ciation of this fact by giving this matter your personal super- vision, so that it may be liquidated at once.  Will you kindly let h us hear from you by return mail, and state just what we may depend upon, for it seems to us that the time has almost come when patience has ceased to be a virtue, and we feel the matter should have prompt attention.

Saul made a great fuss, for a while and abused the man God set up in the stead of Joseph. ##1 Samuel 18:9-12## So Brigham abused the  man James, yet God was with James both by signs, and wonders, and proved to the church James was the Successor of Joseph.

I have given the subject some thought and reflection, and I now feel prepared to answer the question, ac- cording to my views. You asked me if I  knew any reason, in case of the death of the President of the Church, why the Twelve Apostles  should not choose some other person to be the  President of the Church, instead of the President of the Twelve Apostles. I think I do know  of several good sound reasons; which I will now give you. In the first place there are two or three plain truths which are eter- nal, everlasting, unchangeable, and immovable, as the pillars of Heaven, as far as this Dis- pensation is concerned; which have been established by the Revelations of God through the mouth of the Prophet Joseph Smith. These truths stare us in the face. First: When the ENDENTRY US POSTAL CARD.

The answer was given to the Utah man, but it did not agree with what Joseph Smith taught his people concerning his suc- cessor thirteen years before his death. The Utah man claimed to be an honest seeker for truth, and wanted to learn who the successor of Joseph Smith was.  We made up our mind to point the Utah man, to what God and Joseph Smith said on that question. Men have claimed they were the duly Ordained, and all others were usurpers, when they were the greatest villains in all the land, and led many to ruin. There was no need of this, as Joseph left all doctrinal questions plainly written in the book of D. and C. Men have seced- ed, and others have cried, Mormon delusion, when these very men were the most deluded of all men. Mormonism, proper, is no delusion. It will bear as close criticism as any other ism, and will stand clear as the sun and fair as the moon, when all other isms will travel with that stone John told of in Rev. xviii, 21.  No man ever contended for good order and the true sciences, clearer than did Mr. Smith. No man despised unsound doctrine in State or Church more than Joseph. And the policy of government he handed down to us yet speaks, though he sleeps with the worthy dead. This subject of Prophet Making is just as clearly set forth in the church Book of Rules, as is any city or state law on election of city or state officers. As early as 1831, he told the church how his successor would be planted in his stead. At his death, all the people had to do to learn the duly appointed man, was to heed the rules he gave them 13 years before his death.  There was no excuse for divisions; the honest man who could read could see when, and through whom he was to be appointed, and would identify the man Angels ordained, to be the successor. But they set the law aside, and set up their own ways. And men are doing the same this day, in sending out Sermons and Tracts far away, deceiving the people by their opin- ions, and the testimony of dead apostates, who preached lies when alive -- and many are led this day by these false teachers. Much of the past work of these villians has been laid to Joseph Smith, when he had no more to do with them  or their principles, than Jefferson Davis.  Many have claimed that Mr. Smith was not parliamentary, and did not claim nor contend for good order. No greater mistake could been made. He claimed the government of God (the church) on earth, could only exist and prosper as it heeded the Priest-hood of the Son of God. And then added: "As no city or State can do legal business without duly authorized officers, no more could the church." We give his views on Prophet Making, and on what terms to accept their Revelations: "We do not consider ourselves bound to receive any revelations from any man or woman without their being called or legally constituted and ordained, and given sufficient proffs of it." -- Joseph Smith's Letter of April, 1833.

Yet we know L. D. S. who have accepted and published to the broad world, Revelations from men that had no more right to get or give reve- lations than Ben Butler or Gen. Sheridan, yet these saints feast on the false tales of usurpers, and call it good. As many as four times during his ministry, he called the attention of his people to his death, and the appointing of another  in his stead. In 1830 he told the church how he was ordained by James and John, (angels). ##Doctrine and Covenants 128:20## In 1831 he, in a definate and a plain way, told the plan that would be adopted in setting a man in his place. This was done that the people might not be deceived by by false brethren or usurpers. Yet with all of these land marks, men have led their fellows from the Rook of Christ to fables and lies. A Book of Rules was adopted by the church, which contained provisions  for filling up any vacancy that might occur by death or otherwise. By this book I will show who the man was that was appointed and ordained to fill Joseph's place. There is no great mystery in this matter, we only take the Book of Rules, and by that, identify the man:  First, When was the Man to be Appointed? Book of Rules, Section 43, Part 1st: "And this ye shall know assuredly, that there is none other appointed unto you to receive Commandments, until he be taken."  There is nothing mysterious about this. All there is of it, there was no one to be appointed until he was taken. This settles the question adversely, with those usurpers and false teachers, who claim Joseph did ever ordain a man (or boy) to stand as President of the church before he was taken. Comment is not necessary. The next question is to let the Book tell us through whom was the successor to be appointed. It reads: "But verily, verily, I say unto you,  that none else shall be appointed unto this gift, except it be through him," -- Book of Rules, Section 43, Part 2. We need nothing plainer on who was to ap- point. We all know how President Harrison appoints officers in the Federal Government, and the plan was carried out on the same principle by Mr. Smith in appointing his successor. Further comment on this is not needed.  The next question we want to learn is the extent of Mr. Smith's power in  planting a man in his stead. We will let the Book settle this also: ##Doctrine and Covenants 43:4|Book of  Rules, Section 43, 2nd Part,## -- says, "If it (the gift) be taken from him, he shall  not have power except to appoint another in his stead. This limits Mr. Smith's  power to simply appoint another in his stead, etc. Then in addition to this the Book reads, -- "And this I give unto you that you may not be deceived -- that you may know they are not of me. ##Doctrine and Covenants 43:6## Will these Rules fail to detect all usurpers, and help us to disern the duly appointed man? We say they will not, for God said: "And this I give unto you that you may not be deceived." Therefore by these Rules we can criticise all that have put up claims, and directly identify the man that was legally appointed, and by Angels ordained, as he told us before, -- (1831).  We have learned when, and through whom, the successor was to be ap- pointed; also the extent of Mr. Smith's power in planting the man to fill his place. We now ask, Who was to ordain the successor? Let the Book answer the question: "For verily I say unto you, that he that is ordained of me, shall come in at the gate and be ordained as I have told you before," -- ##Doctrine and Covenants 43:7|Book of D. and C. Section 43, Part 2.##  This part of the planting the man into the Presidency, is like all the other parts, plain and definite. He was to be ordained as he had told us before, this date or time. In 1830 we are told, the Prophet Joseph, was ordained by Peter,  sideways text It make no odds, if you build your nests in  the clouds, illegible or tops of mountains he will bring you down, as well as he did the Jews for executing the Son of Man.

Because he was the President of the Twelve Apostles.  And when the Twelve Apostles came to organize a First Presidency again, which of the Twelve Apostles was moved upon to claim the right to preside over the Church above John Taylor? Such a thing did not enter into the heart of  one of the Twelve, nor any other man,  except Brother Daniel H. Wells, and  he said he had a Revelation that Joseph F.

By this we learn that the successor was to be or- dained as the predecessor was ordained, no less no more. This compels us to hold that the successor was to be ordained by Angels. The Book (D. and C.) brings us to these and no other conclusions. Thus we have fulfilled our prom- ise, by simply telling the public what the Book says on the appointment and ordination of the successor to Joseph Smith.  After setting forth the law on appointing and ordaining the successor, we will add our own testimony: First, Joseph Smith was duly called and legally ordained even by Angels, and stood to the nations of the earth as did Moses. He filled his mission like a brave man. He translated from the records the Book of Mormon, which contains the history of the Indians, and many other important facts concerning the nations of this day. He need not suffered as he did, yet he chose it rather than the honors of this short life. He was aware of the fate that should befall him, but he stood up to do the work given him to do. He died as a servant of God and the Christ Jesus Christ and has his reward.  At the death of Joseph, Mr. James J. Strang claimed he had been ordained in the same way that Joseph was (by Angels) and had been legally constituted the President of the Church. He published his claims, sent them abroad, and published to the world he was ready and willing to meet, and discuss his claims with any that were willing to compare their views with his. He clearly proved his authority to all that took pains to criticise them. He was identified by the public in and around the country where he lived and died, as the legal succes- sor of Joseph Smith. He translated from the recoreds that was taken from Laban the Book of the Law of the Lord, a work that Lehi had in view when he said that Joseph should write. See 2nd Book of Nephi, 2nd Chapter. This Book of the Law of the Lord, is often spoken of in the Bible, and has been called one of the lost Books.  James, like Joseph, had bitter persecutions, yet he bravely stood for the truth and right. He had presented views of his martyrdom, and called his friends aside and gave them hints of coming trouble. He, like Joseph, might of avoided it by leaving the church and seeking his own ease in the world. But he chose to stand to his duty as the leader of God's people, and meet his fate. We need not speak of his noble life, for it is read and known by the hon- orable men that meet him in the legislative halls of his state.  It is true, many of the usurpers lied, and to cover their false claims they misrepresented him and his teachings. But they stand on the page of history, and will be read and known as long as sun and moon endure--while the usurp- ers will fall with their lies. Men will yet rise up and honor the names of Joseph and James as the chosen of God. ^Son^  We would like to end our testimony here and say, Peace to all Men; but we want to warn all honest men, that they be not led by usurpers and false teachers. It is a fact well known in all the factions of the Mormon schools, that Wisconsin and terminated in the Re-organization, have from the first, accused the others of holding bad faith. And to this day have accused the Utah people of holding to lies, and teaching false doctrine. By the land laws, they had a right to hold up to public gaze what they held to, so long as their views were not opposed by the Government.  But let us take a look into the eyes of this re-organized child and see if we don't find sand: This child of Gurley and Briggs has given the Martyr the lie, and if Clark Braden knew how to handle the truth and lies, he would need no  sideways text I only teach the Revelations, of God, to his duly sent prophets.

(Now if Brother Cannon has become converted  from this theory, or any one of the Twelve, they certainly must have some very strong reasons  for it.)  Now Brother Grant, I have given you one of the reasons why I consider the President of  the Twelve should become the President of the Church, in case of the death of the President. If the President of the Twelve is not fit to become the President of the Church, he is not fit to be the President of the Twelve Apostles.  Again, there is another eternal truth stares  me in the face. In case of the death of the President of the Church, Brother George Q. Cannon,  Wilford Woodruff, the President of the Twelve, nor any six of the Twelve Apostles, combined, have the power to appoint a President for the Church. It takes Twelve men or  a majority of them, to appoint a President for the Church.

ENDENTRY been a dissenting voice with the Twelve A- postles. And I certainly do not believe, should President Taylor die to-day, that Brother George Q Cannon, nor any other man, could use argument enough, to convert a major- ity of the Twelve Apostles to depart from the beaten track laid out, and followed by the inspiration of Almighty God, for the last fifty seven years, by the Apostles, as re- corded in the history of the Church.  As far as I am concerned, it would require not only a much stronger argument than I have ever heard, but a Revelation from the same God who had organized the Church, and guided it by inspiration in the chan- nel in which it has travelled for fifty- seven years, before I could give my vote, or influence, to depart from the path followed by the Apostles since the organization  of the Church.  Again, President John Taylor and Wilford Woodruff are the only two men now living in the flesh, who listened to the words and charge of Joseph Smith the Prophet to the Twelve Apostles before his death. When he said: "Brethren, I have had sorrow of heart ENDENTRY better ropes (doctrine false) to hang the boys he has been playing with who claim to defend Joseph as a Prophet. They tell us that Joseph Smith did in 1843 anoint and ordain his son, and publicly on the stand in Nauvoo, said: "I am no longer your Prophet, but this, my son, is your Prophet."  When this same Joseph had told the church years before, that all the part he would be able to take in planting another man in his stead would be to ap- point, and that he would not do until he was taken. Gentlemen of No. 17, will you tell us what to call you? Speak out, and tell us what to call you. We want to call men and things by their right name. One thing is sure, Joseph either lied or else you have in that No. 17. Them Books and writings that Joseph left us, don't lie. Nor do we have to hunt from Bos- ton to Oregon, to find witnesses to prove what they teach. The writings of Malichi and the prophets, stood true and inde- pendent of even the words of Christ and his Apostles.  So with the work of Joseph, what he told the world was true, independent of the testimony of thousands. Yet false witnesses came against Moses, Christ, and all the servants of God; we have page after page of their lies against the truth. So with Joseph and James, we have their merit and on it we stand, and the usurpers may compile and send out their tracts with the testimony of apos- tates and dead Psuedoes who, when alive, told and published lies against Joseph But the words of the Prophets Joseph and James, stand to us as the north star to the Mariners on the ocean, at the midnight hour.  It looks bad to see a certain school of Saints throwing stones at Utah, when they are telling lies daily. It reminds us of the old tricks of Ephraim, as found in ##Hosea 12:1|Hosea, xii-1##; he lied daily in them days. Let the tales of modern Ephraim speak for thsmelves. One thing is certain, if Clark-Braden knew how to handle Joseph Smith and his works, he could find plenty of ropes (lies) in sight of these men he has been debating with, to hang them, but not a string as large as a fine thread to hurt Joseph or James. Joseph said in 1831 he would only have power to appoint a successor; he also said the successor would not be ap- pointed until Joseph was taken. This was all right, and came to pass just as Joseph said thirteen years before--it was fulfilled in 1844. But here comes up a school of fellows and tell us that Joseph did anoint and ordain his son in 1843, and constituted him the President of the Church. Clark-Braden can't hurt Joseph nor his successor on the policy of these wise Mormon Legislators, who try to make Joseph a man-made and man-sent prophet. But if he can't take Joseph's words and make them false teachers like himself, then he is small potatoes and few in a hill, (to use a figure).  In conclusion, we say that we have proved that Mr. Smith pointed out the policy that would be taken at his death, in planting a man in his stead. Mr. Strang was the only man that ever presented legal claims to that office. We might call up the names of scores that came out at that time and gave their testimony to the world that James was the man. We might call over the names of men and women, but we have our case without. If men will not accept of what we have taken from the Books, they can go where all unbelievers go. But there is one question that I am often asked: Who stands at the head of the work of God, now? I answer, the man that holds the highest Priesthood! It is the work of God, and He builds or pulls down when and whom he will. Joseph Smith could not ordain a man to fill his place, but he could ordain a man to fill any other office in the church. It took Angels to ordain him, and it  sideways text Yes as God cast out all the Hebrews, but Joshua and Calib by then. So by  his Prophet he cast Brigham and those that followed him.

But we have no record that James should appoint a man to fill his place. Yet we can tell our friends, who held the highest Priesthood in the Church at the death of James.  Nov. 6, 1846, James J. Strang was commanded to go and anoint and ordain Hiram held. We have all the proof we want that James did obey God. And that left the son of Joseph as one of the Presidents of the Church, and the Book of Rules says in case of death of either of the 1st Presidents, the other shall preside until the vacancy is filled. This was the situation of the church at the death of James. So that by the virtue of the ordination Joseph obtain under the hands of James and no other ordination. We hold him the legal President of the Church from the death of James to this day.  Let those that want light on this last statement, get the Revelation of Nov. 6, 1846. That will tell on what young Joseph stands, and on what he don't stand. Then I am questioned as to why I don't join the Gurley and Briggs Re- form, handled now by young Joseph, my reply is: I was baptised in 1842, stood by Joseph until death, then I accepted James, and stood by him until he was shot; then when I learned that James did obey God and did anoint and ordain the youth, I have identified him as the President and Patriarch as was Hyram Smith, and I have nothing to join or disjoin. I stand in the same church that I was baptised into in 1842. If the church will not save men and me, I fear that one got up by men that accuse Joseph of lying and not doing as he promised, will be no help to me.  I hold Mr. Smith as President of the Church, yet he don't hold the degrees of Priesthood that Joseph did; he don't hold the keys of Mysteries; he don't hold the Sceptre in his hand as did Strang, yet he will stand as President until God removes him and sends another. But says one, "How can you hold him as President, when he will not identify you in the Priesthood you obtained under James?" What need I care how he holds me or don't hold me, when I know what I have got and what he has. I am not a Republican, yet I will hold Har- rison as President whether he pleases me or not, until his term is out. Yet I will not endorse his veto or Bills he don't veto. I will stand back and say, Mr. Harrison, go on, your time will run out! So I say of young Joseph, go ahead, I will not adopt nor endorse your teachings. But I will say to all men, that he is the President and only man in all the earth that holds Keys as did Hyram Smith. I am just as well satisfied that young Joseph is doing the work, as that John the Baptist, yet his people teach many things contrary to the order of God's House.

And still, after sixteen years of revolution and change Brigham Young was President of the Church, without turning to the right or left, from the path marked out by the Revelations of God. And that pro- phecy is also recorded; and there was not one chance in ten for that prophecy to be fulfilled, that there is for Joseph F. Smith to be president, in the regular channel of the  oOrder of God.  Now, Brother Grant, I have given you my reasons for believing that, in case of the death of the President of the Church, it is the right of the ^President of the^ Twelve Apostles to become the President of the Church, and that the  majority of the Twelve Apostles will so decide, until the coming of the Son of Man.  Now, Brother Grant, if you have any argument, or light, outside of what I have presented, as the path for the Twelve Apostles to walk in, dif- derent from what we have followed as a Church, and will forward it to me, I will carefully give it investigation. But, I will confess, I do not know the reason why Brother George Q. ENDENTRY Tooele, July 14, 1895.  President Wilford Woodruff  Salt Lake City.

Dear Brother:  In reply to your letter of the 17th. inst. calling me as a missionary to the Southern States, will say that I fear it  will be impossible for me to leave by the time stated in your letter as Brother Burgoyne is about to leave on a trip to Eurpope and will  probably be absent until the first of October. And as I am in his e employ as manager of his business here, cannot arrange to leave before his return.  If you can possibly arrange to change my mission to the British Isles I would consider it a great favor, as I have a number of  relatives there whom I would like to see and to collect the gen- eology of our family. If this change can be made I will be ready  to start as soon as Brother Burgoyne returns which will be some time in October.

I see no reason why we should be so anx- ious to fix up bridges to cross over, that we may never see in this life. It is a  bridge, I never expect to cross, for I never  expect to outlive the President of the Church.  And I think we all have sufficient business  on hand to attend to, without troubling our- selves about affairs we may never see.  Of course President Taylor, like all other men,  will die some timeâ€”when that day comes, it will be quite time enough for the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles to attend to the organiza- tion of the Presidency of the Church.
