 I know that the work is in  need of the help of every true  Latter-Day-Saint, and as I   said before, I am on hand  just as soon as I can get  ready to take a mission. But  at present I am in debt,  which I could not leave.    Now I do not wish you to  think that I am pleading  poverty, for am not. I am  richly blessed of God, and  am truly thankful. But I  could not leave till I have  payed for this property which   is now only partly paid for.    If you think that I am of  more value as a foreign mis-  sionary than I am at home,  which I do not doubt, I am  at the service of the calling

 Boston July 8th 1845    Dear Brother Woodruff    I take this oppertunity of  writing to you.  As, I, understand that your business calls  you all over England.  I, wish to make you an agent  for my Mother. I, must in the first place make you  acquainted with the circumstances.  We are Natives of  Halifax. Nova Scotia and about forty five, or seven years  ago, George Peck. the only Brother of Frederick Peck,  left Halifax for England.  We do not know that this  is the precise time of his leaving, but it is near it  we have since seen his name on the Navy List,  and about 20 or 22 years ago there was letters, and  came to Halifax stating that there was property  advertised for the Heirs of the said Frederick Peck  A man by the name of William Peck, but no relation,  to the person above stated, took the letters from the  Post office, but we beleive received no satisfaction.  Frederick Pecks wife, was, Ann, Mary, Bartling of  Dartmouth Nova Scotia, and her oldest Daughter  Ann Mary Peck is the person who now directs  this letter.  She thinks the surest way to get this  information would be from the Agents of the  General Recorders office of London or Liverpool.  I shall be happy to hear from you as soon as

 Willard City Box Elder County  Febry 11th, 1892    Presdt Woodruf & Council    Dear Brethren:    In answer to yours of recent date, in regard to my  feelings & circumstances to going on a mission to the  Continent.

Last summer I had the misfortune to  fall from a load of Hay, breaking my leg and frac-  turing my hip, and am quite lame yet.

Your Brother    Ulrich Stauffer    We leave it to his Judgment as to wheth-  er he can or ought to go or not - If  he has faith & strength to go let  him say so - if he thinks his condition  not suited for a mission, I would honorably  release him from the call.

 world from the hour of his death.   What I the Lord have revealed   in that testament and decreed  upon the nation, and upon all   the nations of the earth, shall be  fulfilled Saith the Lord of hosts.  I the Lord have spoken and   will be obeyed. My purposes   shall be fulfilled upon this   nation, and no power shall stay   my hand. The hour is at the  door when my wrath and in-  dignation will be poured out   upon the wicked of the nations.  Their murders, blasphemies,  lyings, whoredoms and abom-  inations have come up before   my face and before the heavens,  and the wrath of my indigna-  tion is full. I have decreed   plagues to go forth and waste ^away^  mine enemies, and not many   years hence they shall not be  left to pollute my heritage. The  devil is ruling over his kingdom,  and my spirit has no place in  the hearts of the rulers of this
