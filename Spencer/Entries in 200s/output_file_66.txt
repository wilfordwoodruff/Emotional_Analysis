Dear Brother Little.  In great haste I sit down to say a few words to you before I leave the City. Had a long in- terview with Mr. Benson yesterday and he exceedingly desires to do business with us he says if he does it for nothing. I was much pleased with my interview with him. He appears to me to be a gentleman. I think it will be well to keep upon good terms with him as far as possible. I would like to have Emigration continue as fast as doors are open either by sea or lands. But I think it right for us to see our way clear in charter- ing ships.—by getting subscriptions among the Saints for that purpose before running any risks, that would be detrimental to the course and a disadvantage to the Church. I like the spirit manifested by Mr. Benson with my interview with him yesterday. And as far as you can, do business with him as cheap as elsewhere. I would prefer to continue business with him, as he apparently manifests much interest in our welfare. I hope the Lord will open your way to get a goodly number out by fall if not before. Bro. Appleby has left the business entirely in regards to chartering a vessel in your hands and is going out with a company by lands,  My respects to Sister Little and all the  Saints.

And Doctor Willard Richards family yesterday carried in 100 apples as their Tithing apples. The currants were  a mammoth crop this season. Brother Hemanway brought me a specimen which were larger than cherries, and of a very fine flavour.  We have much cause to be grateful to our Heavenly Father for his abundant goodness to us as a people this season, the elements have conspired just to favor us. We have had several excellent showers this summer; and hay lots, on which 2 and 3 tons of hay were cut last season, have produced this season 10 and 12 tons.  September 4th.

The weather for the past month was considered warm and dry—a rich harvest has been reapt in many settlements and others are busingly engaged reaping.  The 4th of July was celebrated with a grand military review; many of the regiments appeared to great advantage with their new  uniform.  The 24th was celebrated at the head waters of Big Cottonwood Kanyon—I embraced the privilege of accompanying the invited of that secluded retreat, where we spent a pleasant time. The G. S. L.  City Springville brass and martial bands were present and filled the air with melody.  The party consisted of 2507 persons with 464 carriages and wagons, 1028 horses and mules and 332 oxen and cows. The light artillery brought a howitzer along, which spoke in high tones from its exalted position. While here Elders Judson Stoddard arrived from the States, bringing the intelligence that the Mail Contract had been taken from Cummins was appointed Governor and a full bench of Judges and other officers  were appointed - to be accompanied by 2500 troops as a small body guard and 700 teams and wagons laden with baggage and provisions for 15 months.

This company will be formed upon this basis; take out small dividends and allow the reserved profits to be used as Capital. There is room for the mulipli- cation of the capital because it will require today 400 Factories to supply the United States with sugar, and this capital will be used in this direction.  I know already of some 8 or 10 places in Nebraska and  Iowa who are offering bonuses of from $40,000 to $100,000 and in one case $150,000 for a company to erect a Sugar factory within their neighborhood. I am prepared to show, as I have already explained to you that it is possible with proper effort to make each Factory pay 10% and a reserve of one half (at least) of its cash (say $250,000). With the capital mentioned above and such bonus as may be received, the first factory will be built and leave enough surplus of the capital which added to a second bonus the reserved profits of the itself to build a second factory the second year; then the two Factories ENDENTRY A.

The four factories the fifth year will build two more making six and the sixth year the six will build three making nine factories.          Thus in 1891 one factory pay 10% =  340,000     1892 two factory pay 10% = 80,000     1893 three factory pay 10% = 120,000    1894 four factory pay 10% = 160,000     1895 six factory pay 10% = 240,000     1896 nine factory pay 10% = 360,000     Total. $1000,000 dividends     The nine factories will be worth at least $300,000 each or $2,700,000 if it is desired to sell them to local syndicates, or if to keep them they will bring an income, if youwe do not build any more factories, of 2¼ millions a year provided the bounty is still continued, if it is not continued the income would be only one half of that amount. The capital at above estimate would be paid back nine times over in Six years.    But supposing only one half of this be realized it is then as good an investment as can be heard of nowadays. ENDENTRY OFFICE OF  THE UTAH SUGAR CO., P. O. BOX 499. Secretary's Department.  Salt Lake City, Utah, 18  This is no wild scheme, it is perfectly feasible and easy of solution.  I had hoped to have been able to carry it out with the home company as a nucleus, but I plainly see that I have no oppor- tunity of doing so, therefore am compelled to seek new associations for the purpose. I have already secured some capital in this direction with the understanding that I be a partner to the extent of one eighth and I have no doubt of securing all I need from selected persons. The plan is in perfect line with the principle of production and belongs to that branch of financial power; and its efficacy has already been demonstrated by such men as Rockefeller and many others of the world's giants who have got hold of the end of a big thing, clung to it, and being satisfied with small dividends at first have multiplied their capital in the same line of business.

I wish to come to your place. I have still some fortune in Germany, consisting of a house and farming land, also three children. The children say they will come to this country. I  have read in the newspapers that you have agents in Switzerland, and thought per- haps you had one in Alsaice. If you have I wish you would have him attend to my  business there, and meet my children and explain to them. If you will do this I will send you authority to act for me; and if I receive any mony from them then I will come to your country. I have already received some information from a member of your church by the name of James Myer Hill. What he told me I have long thought to be true, and I have already experienced that it was true. A great many families here have only one or two children, and they think by so doing they are doing right but they have no luck either in their increase or their life. Goes on to relate that a pastor there had one son; ^the pastor^ took sick and died suddenly; his wife after a long sickness also died; the son became crazy and was put in an asylum; he after- wards came out, married a French lady, moved to France; she got the fortune and left him pennyless. He asks for information concerning church doctrines, and how to get here. Encloses stamps and requests immediate answer - he is evidently in a hurry.  ENDENTRY University of Utah.

J A Donaldson ENDENTRY MR. SMITH'S "REVELATION."  THE new declaration of Mormon faith adopted at the recent conference of the  Elders at Salt Lake City is, with the ex- ception of the article expressing obedience to the law, identical with the original declaration drawn up and promulgated in 1842 by JOSEPH SMITH, the founder of the sect. It therefore — although the Elders may not be aware of the fact — affords an opportunity of an early test of the genuine- ness of one at least of the Divine revela- tions which SMITH claimed to have re- cieved. Both declarations contain the following article: "We believe in the  " literal gathering of Israel and in the  " restoration of the ten tribes; that Zion " will be built upon this continent; that " CHRIST will reign personally upon the " earth, and that the earth will be renewed " and receive its Paradisiacal glory." Now, in his "Autobiography," SMITH told his followers that it had been revealed to him when the second coming of CHRIST would take place. He did so in the fol- lowing passage: "I was once praying " very earnestly to know the time of the " coming of the Son of Man when I heard " a voice repeat the following: 'JOSEPH, " ' my son, it thou livest until thou art " ' eighty-five years old, thou shalt see " ' the face of the Son of Man; there- " ' fore, let this suffice, and trouble me " ' no more in this matter,'" As JOSEPH was born on December 23, 1805, this "re- "velation" fixes as the same date of the present year as the time of the second coming. On that day, then, the honesty of the founder of Mormonism will be put to the test. Should the "revelation" prove to have been incorrect it will, of course, be open to the  present head of the Church to assert that he also has had one explaining the diffi- culty in a satisfactory manner, just as he has had one authorizing him to throw polygamy overboard at a time when its retention had become embarrassing and was likely to prove disastrous to the  Church. But this will not do. Either the "revelation" made to JOSEPH SMITH is true or it is not. If on December 23 next we find that it is not, there will be even more reason than ever to believe the  founder of Mormonism to have been a  rank imposter. As it is, no one outside of the Mormons themselves believes other- wise of him, bit it will be satisfactory to have even at this late day a new proof of his imposture.  EDITORIAL NOTES.

I must of course run the risk of its ever reaching you. I wrote you a long letter by Docr Bernhisel, which I trust you got. I then told you my feelings, and our determinations with regard to submitting any longer to the oppression of our enemies. The army sent by the President of the United States, approached to Fort Bridger one hundred and fifteen ^miles^ from this City, and there stopped for the winter, the inhabitants of that Country burned every thing to the ground at the approach of the enemy; they burned up improvments worth about $300,000 dollars and retired into Salt Lake County. The  army is now in Winter Quarters, we shall defend ourselves as long as we can, then burn every thing and flee to the Mountains; we all feel it to be more honorable to even loose our lives in maintaining those rights and blessing guaranteed unto us by the Constitution and Laws of our  Country, than to longer submit to tyranny, oppression and  religious persecution.

You may ask what we will do? I will tell you  and all our friends what we shall do, and it is the only  thing we can do, and preserve ourselves, and that is to fight. What, fight the United States? Yes, and all Hell, if  they come against us to destroy us. We have either got to  do this, or put ropes on our necks and walk out and say  'Gentlemen, will you please hang us,' and this we are not  disposed to do; we had rather die fighting for our lives,  liberties and rights, and defending the Constitution of  the United States, against a mob, even if this mob be  legalized by a town, city, county, state, or the nation  than to any longer bear the persecution we as a people  have had to pass through for the last 25 years. We are  determined to bear these things no longer, even if we are  opposed by the United States, or the world.  We have broken no law, either of God or man; the  Constitution and Laws of the United States guarantee unto  us all that we ever have asked for, and if they make  war upon us it is because of our religion, and the ungodly  persecution and treatment of our Government towards Utah  is too plainly manifest not to be mistaken.

The  Government has sent the most corrupt set of scoundrels to  rule over us that can be found on earth, and yet we  have treated them with kindness, and they have gone  away and lied about us as bad as they had power to  do.  You may laugh at the idea of our standing against  the United States if they come against us, but when they  fight against us they will fight against God, and they  will find it out before they get through with it; they will  find it worse than the Florida war, and they will want  to let out the job of killing the Mormons before they get  half through with it, and when this nation begins to  destroy any part of the the inhabitants for their religion  it will be a signal for the downfall of our Government,  and it is as sure to fall as there is a God in Israel.  Capt. U. S Army  came in advance of the troops with 30 men as his body- guard, to visit our Ham's  Fork, and came in with two of our brethren. He has been  here several days and has been kindly treated by the Governor  and all the people. Governor Young has told him all our intentions and kept nothing back. He is satisfied that we are belied and abused, and he will do all he can to avert the impending storm.

The history of the Galatin election riot, as  given in Mother Joseph Smith the Prophet,  page 221, is, I believe, incorrect. As you took a pro- minent part in that affair you will confer a favour by  furnishing this office with a correct account of that trans- action, it being the first blow struck by the mob to- wards expelling the Saints from the State of Missouri.  Your early attention to this matter is desirable, as the  book is undergoing correction.  W. Woodruff ENDENTRY God we shall carry them out, so if they undertake to  wage a war of extermination against the 'Mormons' they  will find a war upon their hands which will be the  dearest one they have ever undertaken since they have  been a nation, for long before the United States of America  conquer the Almighty, kill 100,000 'Mormons', and 1,000,000 of Indians, and have to march 1000 miles over a  barren desert, through mountains and Kanyons to accom- plish it, they will find themselves with an empty treasury  in the grave. But if they are determined to try it, let  them try it, and you watch the signs of the times, and  you will see where victory lies, you will find that the  victory is not to the strong, nor the race to the swift: but  I leave this subject.  Several of the Government baggage trains are in  our Territory, with nothing to protect them. Some 800 soldiers are on the way, this side of Laramie; where they  will winter I do not know, but it will not be this side  of the mountains.  We are making all the preparations for war we  can. There will not probably be any mails, but if  you can send me letters any how, do so as I would  like to hear from you. You can correspond with Dr  Washington.  There are many things I would like to write, which I must omit. Mrs Woodruff and the children are all well.

The brief sketch of the History of the Twelve, had been forwarded to the Printers, they are only intended as a synopsis, leaving each of them the opportunity to publish the same in full, at their leisure.

He was the President of the Twelve, and the quorum backed him up and sustained him, you  claiming more authority than the Eleven, went your own way, we regret the result exceedingly: it was your duty not only to council with the Twelve, but to take their counsel.

Brother Lyman we ask you, to think for a moment of the great promises made to men in ^an^ the foundation of Jany 1841 who have fallen, or who have apostatized us and remember that all those promises are upon cond^it^ions We will name Bennet the Lord promised to crown him with glory if he continued; also William Lowe you remember had great blessings in the same revelation, and the conditions of them all, that he continue to observe the counsels of the Presidentcy. when Joseph was taken away, the Priesthood continued with the quorum of the Twelve, with the fulness of the authority of the Priesthood, and when you turned your heels against it, Satan had you in his sive, and like chaff you were blown away. Come back again, brother Lyman, and dwell in Zion, and resume your duty enjoined upon you by the Lord, and preach for Zion in meekness, and listen to the councils of the Presidency, the Church, and dare to arrogate to yourself authority over your brethren. Brigham Young ordained you to the apostleship he was the President of the quorum, and every member of that quorum whom Satan did not blow away as chaff, have stood with and by him, and faced every storm with him, as you would have done, if the light of the Spirit had been with you, "and he that gathereth not with us, scattereth abroad".  Prest. Young by his persevering industry, untiring energy, and unexampled faithfulness, has been enabled to gather the Saints into the mountains, to the very place that Joseph had organized a company to explore: sent the Elders to almost every nation; translated the  book of Mormon, and the revelations into many languages, and published them to the four quarters of the earth; and been enabled to defend the Saints from the unconstitutional aggressions of our chief Magistrate. The God of Israel hath done him thus his servant Brigham, and his faithful brethren who have stood by him while those who led away factions, have wasted and are forgotten: many from your State and even some of your own posterity have found their way to Zion ENDENTRY Such a Nation ought to feel the wrath of Almighty God, and be broaken in peaces, and the sceptre any Government taken out of their hands and given into the hands of rightous men which will be the case as the Lord Loves, For No Nation never did nor never can live longong after persuing the course the United Stats are doing today.

Dear Sir -- I am compiling the history of our exodus from Nauvoo to these valleys of the mountains in 1846.  This part of the history of theChurch of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints will be not only presented as one of the most striking and prominient events in the dealings of God with this people in their rise and progress, but it will stand in bold relief as the main key of the American history of the nineteenth century.  Closely intermingled with this conmemora- ble history, which will be read with feelings of deep interest by future generations, the name of Col. Thos. L. Kane stands most prominent, not only as a philanthropist, and one that made superhuman exertions to dam up and roll back a mighty flood of wrath, indignation, and persecution, issuing forth from a powerful nation of twenty millions of freemen, with the intention of anni- hilating, at one fell swoop, thirty thousand men, women, and children, because they had the independence of mind to worship God according to the dictates of their own consciences, and to fulfil the destiny marked ^out^ for them by the God of heaven, but as an instrument in the hands ENDENTRY since My return from I Have felt that as soon as I could get my Business and family straitened around so that they would not suffer, that if My Brethren felt the spirit that it was the Lord's will I would be more than willing to be one of about five  Missionaries to go to the Yakies in Sonora Mexico that same People that are or Have been in trouble with the Mexicans and who are of the same grade or inteligence as the Ysletas now there are some reasons that to me seems good that it is a proper time to open the door of the Gospell to them, Amediately.  My experience in this direction and with this Peopl is that they are very strong Catholicks it Has been rooted and grounded in them for ages together with the Power that the Priests Have over them, thus forming as it were an iron Band which up to date our Elders Have found to be a very great Barier ENDENTRY You complain that T. B. Marsh have been received into the Church. Hyde and Phelps were received and endowed by Joseph Smith, and we have yet to learn that even you objected to it in his life time. Marsh lived upon fauks for more a score of years, and finally wandered a miserable object of pity, poor, naked, destitute and disconsolate, and appeared before a congregation of 8000 Saints, and humbly asked them to forgive him, and let him at least dwel in our midst; they did forgive him, and permitted him to be baptized, and he remains a member, a living, palsied, limping spectacle of the fruits of apostacy, had you have been in the midst of Zion, he would have asked you, as he did all the Saints, to forgive him.  You remind us that in Caldwell, you were called upon to lead the Armies of Israel, when they were surrounded by their enemies, the hosts of hell; the reason you was called upon was, you was at your post, then, you was there in the midst of Israel, valiant in the testimony of Jesus and the defence of Israel; but when the tremendous power of one great man James Buchanan goaded on by the clamor of the people, was hurling his legions upon the Children of Zion, ^to crush from the Earth, the Priesthood;^ and when the nerve of every faint hearted member trembled to the center, and the bloody war cry was reiterated from every corner of Christendom "wipe out Mormonism", where was its old defender? was he in the midst of the trouble; was he the foremost to defend the innocent; to lift the Standard of Zion; to face the monster; fearless, and  determined to encourage the Saints in the dread encounter? or was he reclining at his ease in the sunny plains of the far famed Elysium of bliss, Texas, writing to me and  my Brethren the Twelve, as if in bitter irony "I thought you was too popular to think of an old codger like me."  You was cut off from the Church in the latter part of 1848, the subject was brought up on the receipt of a pamphlet which you published against the Authorities of the Church.  Brother Lyman come home to Zion, mingle in our midst, confess and forsake your sins, and do right, as we and all men have to do, in order to enjoy the favor of God, and the gift of the Holy Ghost, and have fellowship with the Saints, then, and not 'till then, will your path be lit up so that you can walk in safety, ENDENTRY 2 of God, and inspired by him, to turn away,  in 1858, the edge of the sword, and save the effu- sion of much blood, performing what the combined wisdom of the nation could not accomplish, and changing the whole face of affairs, the effects of which will remain forever.

We have on file your letters to us and communications with the leaders of this people, commencing while we were on our pilgrimage in the wilderness, and continuing more or less up to this day. We have also copies of some letters to you from your worthy, noble, and honored father, breathing forth nothing but the inspirations of a great and good heart, and good will towards an oppressed people.

We would like also to publish your corespondence, as we advance in the dates, and some letters from your father (God bless him! he posessed a noble soul), one bearing date Aug. 18, and the other Sep. 4, 1846. His letters contain nothing but good will to an afflicted people, and great anxiety for his son, who was sick in our midst. We wll endeavour to use prudence in anything we print. Nothing of our history goes to press until it has been thoroughly inspected by President B. Young. Please drop me a note upon this subject at your convenience, and you will much oblige me.

We would be very sorry to publish any thing that is not correct, and especially to injure the char- acter or feelings of any of our brethren, but the History of Joseph Smith Feby. 5th, 1858 stresses that "Elder Lyman Wight stated, that he considered all other accu- sations of minor importance compared to their selling their lands in Jackson county; that they (Phelps and Whitmer) had set an example which all the Saints were liable to follow. He said that it was a hellish principle, and that they had flatly denied the faith in so doing."  Now, whether the fact was so, or not, is not the  point at issue, but the above shows that Lyman considered it was so, and that is all that is stated; and as this history was compiled while you were one of the Historians, we consider the written authority sufficient reason for our declining to publish a contradic- tion of the statement and particularly as it now leaves "Lyman to lie on his own hook."

As you and myself have been on terms of intimacy for some time, I felt that I would like to write you as to some of these experiences I have stated above, because they are largely the external witnesses that helped to fasten in my breast the "assurance of faith" that I now enjoy of the correctness and divinity of the mission of Joseph Smith, and the "latter day work."

ENDENTRY present situation My immediate and ultimate  resolve is to be a proper ordained  missionary for Hindustan but as you may also see this impracticable just now, the rules not admitting of it, I must be content to work as a lay missionary. I have some adherents but the different the opions  they are serving is a great deal in their way of honest thinking.  There I may just briefly  state that though for 34 years of my life I have been  a Presbyterian, I have never  ceased to hanker for some thing not completed. ENDENTRY and remember with what joy and satisfaction my faith in the gospel gave me. I have attended testimony meetings with my father where the spirit of the Lord was so strongly diffused, that I have felt as though I was in the presence of God Himself. My feelings have been so buoyant, so light, that it seemed as though I was walking on air; and when I retired to rest at night, with that calm, that "Heavenly frame," surrounding me,—yes, entirely enveloping me—I have been led to exclaim "Surely goodness and mercy will follow me all the days of my life, and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever."  After I left England and I remained in Kansas. My faith remained strong for a good while, in fact I never denied the faith, but my surroundings were such that I drifted away, and the good spirit I enjoyed left me. When I came out of the Army in 1864 my relatives and friends were nearly all Presbyterians, I had donated a sum of money to help build a church and the Pastor wished me to be one of the board of Trustees, to which I consented, but later requested me to allow my name to go on the church books.

After some importunity on the part of my relatives, I consented provided I should not be required to subscribe to the Con- fession of Faith, which the Pastor and the "Lession" consented to. I became a Presbyterian in that way, my only baptism (except when a child by the church of England) being that I received when I first became a Latter day Saint.  Becoming involved in political controversy, I gave very little attention to theological subjects, and for some time I went along quite smoothly. Later along I began to give the subject some thought, but the moment I began to think, to study and enquire, that moment I became uneasy, and doubts and fears would encompass me about until I was really unhappy. I attended prayer  meetings, but found no comfort.  In the town in which I resided there existed quite an atheistic, an infidel element, which caused me to begin a metaphysical investigation. I read Spencer Tindal, in fact both sides, but landed in the Theistical school, and began to combat the other side. ENDENTRY 1— Q. S. W. Richards as reported in Vol. 14 of the Millennial Star at page 259, which reads as follows: "It is the duty of every officer in the Kingdom of God to turn his heart, his feelings and his affections to his President, and as you seek after the spirit of the Lord to enable you to do his will, so with the same fervency of soul seek after the spirit and the will of your President to do the same with all lowliness of heart."  Permit me to ask you whether or not you do not now believe and teach in accordance with the above doctrine? If you no longer believe in that doctrine, when and where has any modi- fication of it ever been published?  1— A. ENDENTRY This diverted my attention for a year or two, but finding I could not give the requisite time to a full investigation, I  was compelled to drop it. The time however that I had given the subject, caused me to investigate the faith that I was supposed to defend. I began on predestination, but it staggered me. The question that confronted me, stared me in the facte, disturbed my sleep at night, and my thoughts by day, was. "Am I one of the elect?" How shall I determine this question. I went to my Pastor I laid my condition  before him. I asked him for some assurance. He told me to "go to the Lord in prayer." He would preach the eternal sufferings of the damned, a suffering, a torment so terrible, that when the mind would attempt to calculate its duration, and would figure on the countless ages of eternity as they rolled along, and passed beyond our conception, then this suffering, this agony had just begun. It is difficult for me to express my feel- ings. It occassionally occurred to me of the infinite satisfaction I had in my early days, and I would say to myself  "O! that I could feel that way now."

Do you not believe and teach this to be true, holding that President Wilford Woodruff as the successor to Brigham Young enjoys the same gift? If not, when was the  privilege of the mouth piece of God curtailed in this re- spect?  2— A. ENDENTRY a "slough of despond" as Bunyan describes, that one was me. In 1886 I was taken quite sick, and my physicians ad- vised me to take a trip to the mountains. When I was able to travel I came to Salt Lake City. The next sunday I went to the tabernacle. They sung "The Spirit of God like a fire is burning," and Bishop Whitney preached. While I sat there some very strange sensations came over me. The long ago came be- fore my eyes, and I thought "How strange."  When I left my home in Kansas I intended to return, but strange as it may appear I am here yet.  Being out of the church, what part I took in political mat- ters, was necessarilly with the Liberal party, but while I so acted I think every one will hear me witness that I never de- nounced a "Mormon." I alway would say to myself, "that is the faith my father died in," and I know he was honest.  In 1890 I began a thorough investigation of theological matters. My mind was drifting towards "Mormonism." I determined to satisfy myself, and it was that which caused me in February 1892 to write the letter I did withdrawing from the Liberal party.

Of course I forsaw what would follow. I knew that contumely would be heaped upon me. I knew that the finger of scorn would follow me. I knew that social ostracism would come, but I determined to take the step, and leave the consequences with my God. And with that step came peace of mind, tranquility of soul, and I feel to exclaim "I know that my Redeemer lives." The assurance of faith that for so long I sought for, but never found, today I have, and enjoy. The despair I encountered as a Presbyterian, today is changed to a joyous hope of a glorious immortality, and that if I endure to the end, if I prove faithful, that I shall gain the crown of glory, shall regain the presence of my Heavenly Father, and dwell with hHim in His eternal Kingdom "Worlds without end"  I have written you quite a lengthy letter.

Woodruff,  Judging by yr former cau^r^se of devotedness to, and wellwishes for the best interests of the Welsh Saints, ^nation^ methinks t'wil be interesting to hear of their present prosperity and future prospects; this interesting topic has merited a place in the bosom of the Prophets and Apostles of this dispensation to some extend, it was our favorite theme in the Western climes; and now, those glorious anticipations which we fondly cherished for many a sweet hour while pacing the Deck, at the still hours of ^the^ midnight watch, are being realised beyond my expectations; in fulfilment of the predictions of our beloved prophet e'er I started on this mission and e'er his exit to the abode of bliss. Bro. Manchester, bent our course  through Birgmingham, were we met the Saints in good spirits, all alive for the "Joint Stock Co." realising as Father Crook told them ^that^ their life and atc depended on its success: here we parted with our beloved Bro.

The object of the meeting was to explain to the Saints and others, that the banish ment of the Saints from Nauvoo, was so far from being the downfall of Mormonism and the last of Zion, and the gathering, as the Priests of Baal and newspapers Editors prophecy that the reverse is precisely the case, tis another "Arcemedis lever," to propel Mormonism over the snowy clifts of ^the^ Rocky Mountain; tis another nail in the coffins of scoffers, and lay^ing^ another corner stone in Zion. poor folks, their little hearts are shut up in nutshells, the Saints rejoiced to understand the superiority of Zion over Nauvoo, and their desire is to reach there. Sunday Held a conference in the same Hall, representing 18 branches all in a healthy and thriving conditions, showing an increase of about 200, since last April, about half of that no. in this branch alone, and making in all about 600 Saints in Wales, and nearly all of the pure stock of Ancient Britons, and yet these are but the first fruits of the "hosts of Eomer from the sides of the North," and judging by the daily increase tis well you go and prepare a place for the glorious Co. that will be, in "The fields of the woods" were else than California will afford us our lgenght and breadth of consecrated ground?

The evening meeting was ocupied by several of the Elders in Welsh and English alternately, testifying of the great and wonderful works of God in the age of the world and each one seemed to be filled with the Spirit of their office, the Hall was crowded with anxcious hearers, many acknowledged the power of the truth, three were babtised that night, making 7 during the Conference Monday at 10 Saints met for buissness -- when I in Welsh followed by Bro Henshaw in English and others showed the different duties of different Officers, the absolute nessesity of a concentration of efforts to success -- and also the danger of hiding a talent when given to Officer or member, that all could act for good in their sphere andc thence called out, and ordained 4 Elders, 19 Priests, 9 Teachers, 6 Deacons, and advised them to prepare to go out when their circumstances wd. permit, all to a man rejoiced in the honor of his Office and pledged their fidelity to the cause. Twas agreed on, that all the Oficers shd. meet once a week to instruct each other in all things nessesary the no of Officers before were 10 Elders, 10 Priests, 8 Teachers and 7 Deacons, Total now in Wales are 14 Elders, 31 Priests, 17 Teachers, 13 Deacons, in all 76. then organised three new branches and the meeting closed to give room for a another scenery, and judging by the busy move of a myriad of the fair, the music of the China by the base of the trays, the laurels, evergreens and flowers to adarn the Hall youd have thought twas a preparation for a splendid tea party, however I was not left long in doubt, for ocular demostrations like tables well set and lined, amounts to facts you know, yes a picture this not of fancy, but of real life, long to be remembered, a type of the "feast  of fat things, of wines on the lees," which shall be, on Mount Zion.  I have been informed that some 400 cards were sold previous to the time and perhaps twice the number partook of the feast, the Co. was as respectable in apearance, conduct, and circumstances as any tea party of the times: and I had ample proof that it was the means of doing good in various ways, all the preposessed prejudices of the guests gave way before it, many of the Sectarians and some of the Priests I was informed came through the Hall to see our "liberty," and the more the better, for we had a specimen of that worthy of their admiration.

The motto over the Stage, "Peace, Union and brotherly love," was a good introduction to the subject, altho this subject is rather new here, it met the almost universal aprobation, and cheered up the hope of the Saints in delightful anticipation of the happy day when the lamb and the lion shall lie down together andc, when peace, love and union shall universaly prevail, and nothing, an imate or inanimate (if such there be) shall hurt or destroy in all the holy Mount.
