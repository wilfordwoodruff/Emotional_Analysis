My desire has always been that if ever I were called on a mission,that I could could reply, that I am ready and willing to go where and when asked. I am sorry to have to report that I do not feel able to go as soon as requested. I do not like ^to^ state my reason, but no harm to tell ^the^ truth. I am at present involvedto such an extent, that I can not seehow I can pick up and go so soon.I would ask till April 1896, instead of 1895. I am the adminustrater of my mothers Estate, which I cannot have settled up by April 13, 1895. I desireto have everything settled up on my accounts settled^Balanced^ before going. I feelthat I could perform a better mission than I could to go under differentcircumstances.

 THE DESERT WEEKLYPIONEER PUBLICATION OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAIN REGION.ESTABLISHED JUNE, 1850.TRUTH AND LIBERTYNO. 15 SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH, SATURDAY, APRIL 6, 1889. VOL. XXXVIII.DISCOURSEDelivered by President Wilford Wood-ruff, at Springville, Tuesday Morn-ing, March 5th, 1889.REPORTED BY ARTHUR WINTER.Brethren and sisters: I feel to say,God bless you. I am glad to meet with you and have the privilege of once more bearing my testimonyto the Gospel of Jesus Christ and the Kingdom of God. What Brother Cannon has told you with regard to the work of the Lord, is true. I have traveled in my day a great many miles with the Prophet JosephSmith. I once heard him say thatif he were the emperor of the world and had control of the whole human family, we would defend every man, woman and child in the en-joyment of their religion, no matter what their religion was, whether it was true or false. He said they had a right to that privilege, and the exercise of that agency which God had given to the whole human family. Those were his sentiments. They are my sentiments today. The Revelator, St. John, represented to us that there would be about six hundred three-score and six differ-ent religions upon the earth in these last days—the number of the name that was spoken of by him. Today that number, I presume, is very nearly filled. The whole Christian world are as diverse in their views and principles of religion and roads to heaven or hell, as the stars are diverse in their position in the heavens. And while I would grant this privilege that I have spoken of,to all mankind, I claim the same privilege for myself and for all our people. We have a right to the en-joyment of our religion and belief, and to practice the same on the earth; and all other sects and parties have the same right.Inasmuch as I claim this, I want to give some of my views and tell you my feelings with regard to the Gospel of Jesus Christ. To com-mence with, I will quote the words of the Apostle Paul. You are doubt-less familiar with Paul's history, and know what a persecutor of the Saints he once was, and how hebecame converted to the truth; andhis conversion was so thorough and complete that he finally laid downhis life in defense of the Gospel of Christ. That same Paul said:"Though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel un-to you than that which we havepreached unto you, let him be accursed."That was a strong declaration; and to make it more emphatic, he repeated it.Now, brethren and sisters, and friends, that Gospel which Paul taught is what I believe in. It is what I have believed in since I was old enough to read the New Testa-ment. My belief in that Gospel was so strong that I never joined any sect or denomination on the earth until I heard a man preach to me

 450 THE DESERET WEEKLYthat Gospel. He held the Priest-hood, and he taught me the same Gospel that Paul taught. As many of you have heard me remark before, I went to Sabbath school, in my boyhood, under Dr. Porter, in Farmington, Connecticut. He and Dr. Haws, of Hartford, Conn., were Presbyterian divines, and were considered great men in that day. In that Sabbath school I read the New Testament. I learned verse after verse and chapter after chap-ter. What did the Testament teach me? It taught me the Gos-pel of life and salvation; it taught me a Gospel of pow-er before the heavens and onthe earth. It taught me that the organization of the Church consist-ed of Prophets, Apostles, Pastors and Teachers, with helps and gov-ernments. What for? "For the per-fecting of the Saints, for the workof the ministry: for the edifying of the body of Christ, till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God,unto a perfect man, unto the meas-ure of the stature of the fulness of Christ." These are the things which I learned, and theymade an impression upon me.I believed in them; yet I had never heard them taught by any clergy-man or divine upon the earth. In my early manhood I attended the meetings of almost every denomina-tion there was. On one occasion I attended one of those great meet-ings which were sometimes held inConnecticut, at which forty or fifty ministers of various denominations were gathered together. They prayed for a pentecostal season and for a good many other things. At this meeting permission was given for anybody to make remarks. I was quite young then. I arose and stepped into the aisle, and I said to that body of ministers: "My friends, will you tell me why you don't contend for the faith once de-livered to the Saints? Will you tell me why you don't contend for that Gospel that Jesus Christ taught, and that His Apostles taught? Why do you not contend for that religion thatgives unto you power before God, power to heal the sick, to make the blind to see, the lame to walk, andthat gives you the Holy Ghost and those gifts and graces that have been manifest from the creation of the world? Why do you not teach the people those principles that theancient Patriarchs and Prophets taught while they were clothed with the revelations of God? They hadthe administrations of angels; theyhad dreams and visions, and con-stant revelation to guide and direct them in the path in which they should walk." The presiding eldersaid: "My dear young man, youwould be a very smart man, and a very useful man in the earth, if youdid not believe all those foolish things. These things were given to the children of men in the dark ages of the world, and they were given for the very purpose of en-lightening the children of men in that age, that they might believe in Jesus Christ. Today we live in theblaze of the glorious gospel light, and we do not need those things." Said I: "Then give me the dark ages of the world; give me those ages when men received these prin-ciples."There is where I stood in my youth. I did not believe that these gifts and graces were done away, only through the unbelief of the children of men. They were done away when men rejected the law ofthe Gospel of Jesus Christ; turned away from the Kingdom of God, built up altars to Baal, and sought to carry out principles of their own. And the earth remained in that con-dition until the Lord raised up a Prophet in these last days. He raised up Joseph Smith, who laid the foundation of this Church and Kingdom. And from that day un-til the present, whenever any one has embraced the Gospel of Christ and lived that religion, the gifts and blessings of that Gospel have been bestowed upon them. And this will be so unto the end.I have traveled many thousands of miles, at home and abroad, preaching the Gospel of Christ to my fellow-men; and, in my experi-ence, I have never known a man or woman who, when they received the Gospel with honest hearts and were baptized, did not receive a tes-timony for themselves. While in England, in 1840, I was inspired of the Lord to go to Herefordshire.There had never been any Elders in that part of the country. When I arrived there I found about six hun-dred people called United Brethren. They had broken off from the Wes-leyan Methodists. They sought forthose ancient gifts that I have been speaking about. They had been praying to God to open the way be-fore them. What was the conse-quence? All of them, except one, including forty-five preachers, were baptized in thirty days. They re-ceived the Gospel, and the gifts andgraces followed them.As I said before, these are the principles that I believe in. And I will say here that this same Gospelwas with Father Adam, with Noah, with Enoch, and with all the an-cient patriarchs and prophets. There has been no change. And I say, as a servant of God, there is no change in the eternal and everlast-ing Priesthood. It is without be-ginning of days or end of years. It is from eternity unto eternity. By the power of that Priesthood, God, our Eternal Father, has organized all worlds, and redeemed all worlds that have ever been redeemed. By that same Priesthood men have ad-ministered on the earth in the or-dinances of the Gospel of Christ. There is no change to the Gospel ofJesus Christ, nor to one of the or-dinances thereof. And whenever that Gospel is offered to the children of men, it is by the power of thePriesthood. No man who has ever breathed the breath of life, since God made the world, has ever had the power to go forth and minister in one of the ordinances of the Gos-pel of Christ, without that Priest-hood; and no man ever will. This may not be believed by many of the inhabitants of the earth; but it is true.We have been gathered to these valleys of the mountains by the power and inspiration of God. We might have gone forth and preachedtill we had become as old as Methu-selah, and if the power of the Al-mighty had not attended that preaching, Utah might still havebeen a desert. But the Spirit of God bore record to the teachings of the Elders of Israel, and the honest inheart and meek of the earth re-ceived the Gospel and gathered to these valleys. This is in fulfill-ment of the revelations of God. John the Revelator, in his vision on the Isle of Patmos, saw "another an-gel fly in the midst of heaven, hav-ing the everlasting Gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, saying with a loud voice, Fear God and give glory to Him; for the hour of His judgment is come." [##Revelation 14:6-7##] Those words have been fulfilled. The angel of God has visited the earth and deliv-ered the fulness of the Gospel unto the inhabitants thereof, and they arereceiving it. By the power of that Gospel you left your homes and cameto these mountains of Israel.Now, Paul says that if we preach any other gospel than that which he taught, we should be accursed. [##Galatians 1:8##] The first principle in that Gospel is faithin Christ as the Savior of the world.

 THE DESERET WEEKLY. 451When men have faith, then they are required to repent of their sins andbe baptized for the remission of sin. This is what Jesus Christ taught, and He set the example himself. Though He committed no sin, He went unto John the Baptist and de-manded baptism of him. John the Baptist said he was not worthy to do it. But Jesus said, "Suffer it to be so now; for thus it becometh us tofulfill all righteousness." [##Matthew 3:15##] After be-ing baptized it is necessary that we should have hands laid upon us by men holding the Holy Priesthood, for the reception of the Holy Ghost. Now, if you have the Holy Ghost with you—and every one ought tohave—I can say unto you that there is no greater gift, there is no greater blessing, there is no greater testimo-ny given to any man on earth. Youmay have the administration of an-gels; you may see many miracles; you may see many wonders in the earth; but I claim that the gift of the Holy Ghost is the greatest giftthat can be bestowed upon man. It is by this power that we have per-formed that which we have. It is this that sustains us through all thepersecutions, trials and tribulationsthat come upon us. We also have the gifts of the Spirit among us. I can bear testimony that the sick have been healed, the blind have been made to see, the deaf to hear and the lame to walk, and devilshave been cast out, by the power of God. These gifts and graces havebeen with this people from the or-ganization of the Church until the present hour. There sits a man [pointing to Brother Philo Dibble ] who, fifty-five years ago, while inJackson County, Missouri, was shotthrough the body because of his re-ligion. If it had not been for the power of God, which was manifest-ed in his behalf, he would have goneto the grave. Other men have beenin like circumstances. The Lord hastaken whom He pleased and when He pleased, and preserved in life those whom He would preserve, ac-cording to the counsel of His ownwill. I bear record that these gifts are enjoyed by this people, according to their faithfulness before God. If we lack these things, it is because we do not live our religion; for if we do our duty before the Lord, those blessings will be with us.Brethren and sisters, the Lord hasset His hand, in fulfillment of the words of the Prophet Daniel, to es-tablish His Kingdom once more and for the last time on the earth and to prune His vineyard with a mighty pruning. [##Daniel 2:26-47##] He has called men and ordained them and sent them forthto prune the vineyard for the last time, before the judgments of God overtake the world. [##Jacob 5:61-77##] These princi-ples are true, and if we will do our duty, the blessings of God will at-tend us. The Lord has set His hand to call forth His Church out of the wilderness. The world has been in darkness and error from the day that Jesus and His disciples died. TheLord took the Priesthood to Him-self. He left the Christian and the Jewish world without the Gospel ofChrist, without a solitary man who had power to administer in the or-dinances of the Gospel. These are the truths of heaven, and I bear re-cord of them to all men, and you will find that they are true when you go into the presence of God. If the Lord ever fulfills His predictions, it is quite time that He began to have a people on the earth who will acknowledge His name. The time has come when God is going to per-form His work. If you want to know what is going to take place, read the Bible. Let the Christianworld read the Bible; they don't be-lieve the Book of Mormon or the Doctrine and Covenants. Let them see what the Revelator St. John saysis going to take place in the last days. Read of the opening of the seals, the pouring out of the plagues the turning of the rivers and the seas intoblood, and of the death and judge-ment that are going to overtake the world. John wrote these things as hewas moved upon by the Holy Ghost, and his words will come to pass. [##Revelation 6-9##]We are living in a great day. These mountains are filled with Lat-ter-day Saints, in fulfillment of the revelations of God. The Lord has commenced this work, and He is not going to leave it. I warn all men of that. Zion is going to bebuilt up. Zion is going to be establish-ed. Zion is going to be clothed with the glory of God. And the Kingdom of God will be like the littlestone cut out of the mountain with-out hands; it will fill the whole earth, and prepare the way for the coming of the Son of Man.Brethren and sisters, this is my testimony. This is the religion that I believe in. Have not I a right tobelieve in it? I say I have. I say to every Methodist, to every Catho-lic, to every Presbyterian, and to all, you have a right to your own belief. We have a little time to dwell herein the flesh. I shall soon be calledto go into the presence of God, and I am willing to meet all theworld there with regard to my testi-mony. I know my testimony is true. I know Joseph Smith's testi-mony is true. I know he sealed his testimony with his blood. It re-quired his blood, apparently, toseal this dispensation, as it did theblood of Jesus and the prophets of old, to seal their dispensations.Brethren and sisters, I want to see you faithful. I want you to be saved in the Kingdom of God. I want to be saved, too. What is gold,what is silver, what is honor, what is the glory of this world? It all per-ishes with the using. Where are the ancient prophets and apostles? They have fallen asleep. Where are thegenerations that have existed before us? They have gone to sleep. Our forefathers are in the spirit world. I shall very soon follow them, I ex-pect. So will you. Our future des-tiny lies on the other side of the vail. When I die I want the priv-ilege of going where God my Heavenly Father is, and where Jesus Christ, the Savior of theworld is— He who taught the doc-trines that Brother Cannon and I are teaching you today, and that the Elders of Israel have taught fromthe commencement of this work. I want to dwell with them, and with our people who have been true and faithful to God. I believe God will save all people, except the sons of perdition, in some glory. There is a glory of the sun; there is a glory of the moon, and a glory of the stars, as one star differeth from another star in glory, so is the resur-rection of the dead. [##Doctrine and Covenants 76:50-113##] All sects, all parties, all people, except those who shed innocent blood or commit un-pardonable sin, will have a glory ac-cording to their condition and the lives they have lived on the earth. As Brother Cannon has said, God offers the Gospel to a generation, andif they reject that Gospel it will cost them dearly. It is a serious thing for any dispensation to reject the Gospel of Christ and to shed the blood of the prophets. What did it cost to shed the blood of the Savior? He came to His Father's house— the Jews. He brought the Gospel tothem, and warned them of thewrath to come. But they rejected the Gospel; they crucified Him and put Him to death. [##Matthew 27:35##] What did it costthem? Jesus told them himself what it would cost them. He said: "And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away cap-tive into all nations; and Jerusalem shall be trodden down by the Gen-tiles, until the times of the Gentilesare fulfilled." [##Luke 21:24##] That yoke has beenupon the Jewish nation until the present day, and it is not broken

 452 THE DESERT WEEKLYyet, and will not be until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled, which is close at our door. Look at Jerusalem after Christwas slain. Look at the trouble and suffering the Jews endured in the great war against Jerusalem, under Titus. Twelve hundred thousand people were taken out of the gatesJerusalem and fell by the famine and by the sword. A remnant was scattered throughout the world, and remains in that condition today. At the present time they are persecuted inRussia, in Austria, in Germany, and in other nations of the earth. They will be persecuted until Christ comes, or near that time.It is the same in this generation, and in every generation in which God has had a people upon the earth. It costs something to shed the blood of righteous men.I say to the Latter-day Saints, do your duty, honor God and remem-ber your covenants. I want these young men and young women of Israel to honor God, to honor their parents, and remember their pray-ers. This Kingdom has got to restupon your heads. The world do not believe these things; but their un-belief does not make the truths of God of none effect. Therefore, I have a right to urge these youngmen to qualify themselves and pre-pare themselves to take the placesof their fathers, and to honor Godand be united. United you stand, divided you fall. Union is that which God requires of us, as a peo-ple. I hope you will lay these thingsto heart. Read in the Bible and you will find that they are true, and they will have their fulfillment. God bless you. Amen.

 The word of the Lord to the Citizens of London, of every sect and denomination: and to every indi-vidual into whose hands it may fall—showing forth the plan of Salvation, as laid down in the New Testament: namely, Faith in our Lord JesusChrist—Repentance—Baptism for the Remission of Sins—and the Gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands. Presented by two of the Elders ofthe Church of Jesus Christ, of Latter Day Saints.FEELING an anxious desire for the salvation of souls,we now lay before the world those principles whichwere taught by our Lord Jesus Christ, and his apostles; and as we implicitly believe the word of God, we declare that a full salvation cannot be ob-tained, except through obedience to all the command-ments laid down in the New Testament. Our LordJesus Christ, previous to his ascension, gave thiscommission to his apostles: "Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature; hethat believeth and is baptized, shall be saved: but he that believeth not, shall be damned; and thesesigns shall follow those that believe: in my namethey shall cast out devils—they shall speak with new tongues—they shall take up serpents—and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them—they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover."Luke (chap. xxiv. 45—50) writes, that he (Jesus) then opened their understandings, that they mightunderstand the Scriptures, and said unto them, Thusit is written, thus it behoveth Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day; and that repentanceand remission of sins should be preached in his nameamong all nations, beginning at Jerusalem; and ye are witnesses of these things, and behold I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem until ye be endowed with powerfrom on high; and he led them out as far as toBethany, and he lifted up his hands and blessedthem. Thus we see that the apostles, notwithstand-ing all the teachings and the many instructions which they had received from their Lord during a three 
 318 The Mormons.The Mormons.CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS.(Statement prepared for THE WORLD ALMANAC by First President Wilford Woodruff.)The following statement of the doctrines of the Church was issued with the approval of the Prophet Joseph Smith:1. We believe in God, the Eternal Father, and in His Son Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Ghost.2. We believe that men will be punished for their own sins, and not for Adam's transgression.3. We believe that through the atonement of Christ all mankind may be saved, by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel.4. We believe that these ordinances are: First, Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; second, Repentance; third, Baptism by im-mersion for the remission of sins; fourth, Laying on of hands for the Gift of the Holy Ghost.5. We believe that a man must be called of God, by "Prophecy, and by the laying on of hands," by those who are in authority to preach the Gospel and administer in the ordinances thereof.6. We believe in the same organization that existed in the primitive church, viz.: Apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers, evangelists, etc.7. We believe in the gift of tongues, prophecy, revelation, visions, healing, interpretation of tongues, etc.8. We believe the Bible to be the word of God, as far as it is translated correctly: we also believe the Book of Mormon to bethe word of God.9. We believe all that God has revealed, all that He does now reveal, and we believe that He will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the Kingdom of God.10. We believe in the literal gathering of Israel and in the restoration of the Ten Tribes; that Zion will be built upon this continent; that Christ will reign personally upon the earth, and that the earth will be renewed and receive its paradisic glory.11. We claim the privilege of worshiping Almighty God according to the dictates of our conscience, and allow all men the same privilege, let them worship how, where, or what they may.12. We believe in being subject to kings, presidents, rulers, and magistrates, in obeying, honoring, and sustaining the law.13. We believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and in doing good to all men; indeed, we may say that wefollow the admonition of Paul. "We believe all things, we hope all things," we have endured many things, and hope to be able to endure all things. If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report, or praiseworthy, we seek after these things.GENERAL AUTHORITIES OF THE CHURCH, 1896.First Presidency--Wilford Woodruff, George Q.

 AN ADDRESS.To the Officers and Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints:The near approach of the date for the dedication of the Temple of our God moves us to express with some degree of fullness our feelings to our brethren, the officers of the Church who with us bear the Priesthood of the Son of God, and to the Latter-day Saints generally; to the end that inentering into that holy building we may all be found acceptable ourselves, with our households, and that the building which we shall dedicate may also be acceptable unto the Lord.The Latter-day Saints have used their means freely to erect other Temples in these valleys, and our Father has blessed us in our efforts. Today we enjoy the great happiness of having three of these sacred structures completed, dedicated to and accepted of the Lord, wherein the Saints can enter and attend tothose ordinances which He, in His infinite goodness and kindness, has re-vealed. But for forty years the hopes, desires, and anticipations of the entire Church have been centered upon thecompletion of this edifice in the prin-cipal city of Zion. Its foundation was laid in the early days of our settle-ment in these mountains; and from that day until the present, the eyes of the members of the Church in every land have been lovingly directed toward it. Looking upon it as the Temple of Temples, the people during all these years have labored with unceasing toil, undi-minished patience and ungrudging expenditure of means to bring it to its present condition of completion; and now that the toils and the sacri-fices of forty years are crowned so successfully and happily; now that the great building is at last finished and ready to be used for divine pur-poses, need we say that we draw nearan event whose consummation is to us as a people momentous in the highest degree? Far-reaching in its consequences as that occasion is certain to be, what remains for us to say in order to impress the entire Church with a sense of its tremendous im-portance!On this point, surely nothing; yetmay we offer a few words upon a phasethat directly touches it. No member of the Church who would be deemed worthy to enter that sacred house can be considered ignorant of the prin-ciples of the Gospel. It is not too much to presume that every one knows whathis duty is to God and to his fellow man. None is so forgetful as to havelost sight of the admonition that we must be filled with love for and charity toward our brethren. And hence none can for a moment doubt the supreme importance of everymember of the congregation being at peace with all his or her brethren andsisters, and at peace with God. How else can we hope to gain the blessingsHe has promised save by complying with the requirements for which those blessings are the reward!Can men and women who are vio-lating a law of God, or those who arederelict in yielding obedience to His commands, expect that the mere goinginto His holy house and taking part in its dedication will render them worthy to receive, and cause them toreceive, His blessing?Do they think that repentance andturning away from sin may be so lightly dispensed with?Do they dare, even in thought, thus to accuse our Father of injustice and partiality, and attribute to Him care-lessness in the fulfillment of His own words?Assuredly no one claiming to belong to His people would be guilty of such a thing.Then must those who are unworthy cease to expect a blessing from theirattendance at the Temple while sinunrepented of still casts its odor about them, and while bitterness or even anunforgiving coolness exists in theirhearts against their brethren and sis-ters.On this latter subject we feel that much might be said. In the striving after compliance with the apparently weightier matters of the law, there isa possibility that the importance of this spirit of love and kindness and charity may be underestimated. Forourselves, we cannot think of any precept that at present requires more earnest inculcation.During the past eighteen monthsthere has been a division of the Latter-day Saints upon national party lines. Political campaigns have been conducted, elections have been held, and feelings, more or less intense, have been engendered in the minds of brethren and sisters upon one sideand the other.We have been cognizant of conduct

I feel like it would be asource of happiness to go an tell my peoplethat I was not decived when I embracedwhat is called Mormonism as I have tastedsome of the sweets which follow obedienceto the gospil of Christ.Since the arrival of your latter, I have beentrying to dispose of property so that I couldpay my debts, and get mony to go with, butas yet without success. What I have to sellis mainly Ephraim City property and as weknow that such has suffered more by thedepressions in value then farming land. I standa poor chance at present.

 years' sojourn with him, were not fully qualified to preach the gospel—they had not been endowed with power from on high. In testimony of this, turn to the ##Acts 2:1-4|2nd chapter## of Acts, which reads thus: "And when the day of Pentecost was fully come they wereall with one accord in one place: and suddenly therecame a sound from heaven as of a rushing mightywind, and it filled all the house where they were sit-ting: and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them: andthey were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues as the Spirit gave themutterance." These things caused the people to mar-vel; some said they were drunk, but Peter, standingup with the eleven, said, "Ye men of Judea, and allye that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto you,and hearken to my words—these are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the day; but this is that which was spoken by the ProphetJoel: And it shall come to pass in the last days, saithGod, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, andyour young men shall see visions, and your old menshall dream dreams: and on my servants, and on myhandmaidens, I will pour out in those days of mySpirit, and they shall prophesy." [##Acts 2:14-18##] Now, we observe, that the apostles, after having received the HolyGhost, were clothed with power, and began to preach unto the people Jesus crucified; and they being pricked to the heart, cried out, "Men and brethren, what shall we do?  Then Peter said unto them, re-pent and be baptized every one of you in the name ofJesus Christ, for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost: for the promiseis unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call. And with many other words did he testify and ex-hort, saying, Save yourselves from this untowardgeneration. Then they that gladly received his wordwere baptized, and the same day were added unto them three thousand souls." [##Acts 2:37-41##]

 and have heard of many expressionsthat have been very painful to us andhave grieved our spirits.We know they have been an offenseunto the God of peace and love, anda stumbling-block unto many of theSaints.We feel now that a time for recon-ciliation has come; that before entering into the Temple to pre-sent ourselves before the Lord in solemn assembly, we shall divest our-selves of every harsh and unkind feel-ing against each other; that not only our bickerings shall cease, but that thecause of them shall be removed, andevery sentiment that prompted andhas maintained them shall be dispelled;that we shall confess our sins one toanother, and ask forgiveness one ofanother; that we shall plead with theLord for the spirit of repentance, and,having obtained it, follow its prompt-ings; so that in humbling ourselvesbefore Him and seeking forgivenessfrom each other, we shall yield thatcharity and generosity to those whocrave our forgiveness that we ask forand expect from Heaven.Thus may we come up intothe holy place with our hearts freefrom guile and our souls prepared forthe edification that is promised! Thusshall our supplications, undisturbed bya thought of discord, unitedly mountinto the ears of Jehovah and drawdown the choice blessings of the Godof Heaven!As your brethren, sustained by yourvote and in your faith as the FirstPresidency of the Church, we havethis to say to the Latter-day Saints, inour individual as well as our officialcapacity: If there is a single memberof the Church who has feelings againstus, we do not wish to cross thethreshold of the Temple until we havesatisfied him and removed from himall cause of feeling, either by explana-tion or by making proper amends andatonement; neither would we wish toenter the sacred portals of that edificeuntil we have sought an explanation,or amends, or atonement fromany against whom we may haveeither a real or fancied grievance.In now announcing this course forourselves, we say to all the other offi-cers of the Church that we desire themto follow our example. We wish themfrom the highest to lowest and throughoutall the Stakes and Wards of Zion totake heed of this counsel. Let theminvite all who may have feelingsagainst them to come forward andmake them known; let them then en-deavor to correct any misapprehen-sions or misunderstandings which mayexist, or give redress for any wrong orinjury that may have been done.We say the same—and when the offi-cers have taken the course indicatedwe wish them to say the same—to theindividual members of the Church. We call upon them to seek to have thefellowship of their brethren and theirsisters, and their entire confidenceand love; above all to seek to have thefellowship of their brethren and theirsisters, and their entire confidenceand love; above all to seek to have thefellowship and union of the HolyGhost. Let this spirit be sought andcherished as diligently within thethe smallest and humblest fam-ily circle as within themembership of the highest organiza-tion and quorum. Let it permeate thehearts of the brothers and sisters, theparents and children of the household,as well as the hearts of the First Presi-dency and Twelve. Let it mellowand soften all differences betweenmembers of the Stake Presidencies andthe High Councils, as well as betweenneighbors living in the same ward. Let it unite young and old, male andfemale, flock and shepherd, people andPriesthood in the bonds of gratitudeand forgiveness and love, so thatIsrael may feel approved of the Lord,and that we may all comebefore Him with a consciencevoid of offense before all men. Thenthere will be no disappointment as tothe blessings promised those who sin-cerely worship Him. The sweetwhisperings of the Holy Spirit will begiven to them and the treasures ofHeaven, the communion of angels, willbe added from time to time, for Hispromise has gone forth and it cannotfail!Asking God's blessing upon you allin your endeavor to carry out thiscounsel, and desirous of seeing it takethe form of a united effort on the partof the whole people, we sug-gest that Saturday, March 25th, 1893,be set apart as a day of fasting andprayer. On that occasion we advisethat the Presidencies of Stakes, theHigh Councils, the Bishops and theirCounselors, meet together with theSaints in their several meeting houses,confess their sins one to another, anddraw out from the people all feelingsof anger, of distrust, or of unfriendli-ness that may have found a lodgment;so that entire confidence may thenand there be restored and love fromthis time prevail through all the con-gregations of the Saints.WILFORD WOODRUFF,GEORGE Q.

 Logan, Utah.Sep 9, 1896President Wilford Woodruff:Dear Sir: I receivedyour letter of the 4th stateingmy name had been acceptedas a Missionary to the NorthernStates and inquireing as tomy feelings consearning thesame and I acan say that thoughthe call was unexpected andfound me unprepared stillI am willing to go and performthe same to the best of myability and have made myarrangements to start upon thedate mentioned: Yours respectfully,Andrew Peterson.Robert Davidson Bp 
 By this we plainly see, that the promise of the Holy Ghost was not confined to the apostles, neither to that nor any other particular age of the world; for Peter dis-tinctly and positively said to you and to your children—tothem that are afar off—even as many as the Lord our Godshall call. [##Acts 2:39##] Now, if this promise of the Holy Ghost wasto continue, then, certainly, faith, repentance, baptism, must continue also: as the Holy Ghost was granted as the seal of their obedience unto these ordinances. If one of these principles be not essential, you may lay aside the whole, since all are equally the commandments of God. In proof of this, the Saviour, in the last chapterof Matthew, says, "Go ye, therefore, and teach all na-tions, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: teaching them to ob-serve all things, whatsoever I have commanded you.And lo! I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen." [##Matthew 28:19-20##] Now, every person possessing commonsense, must allow, that when the Saviour said all thingshe did not mean apart. The question is frequently asked, on hearing a quotation from the word of God,"What does it mean?" We wish to be distinctly un-derstood, that when the Lord speaks, or reveals hisword unto the children of men, he means just what he says. The manner in which the word of God has been spiritualised, and the diverse interpretations which have been given by commentators and teachers of the people,in this day and generation of the world, is one greatcause of the apostasy of the churches of the present day from the ancient Apostolic Religion. There has evi-dently been a departure from the faith once delivered tothe Saints. Of this the many different systems is asufficient proof, as the Scriptures teach us that there is one Lord, one faith, one baptism, and one body, as setforth by Paul, in ##1 Corinthians 12:12-27|Cor. xii.## In ##Galatians 1:8-9|Gal. i.##, the apostle also says, "Though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other Gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed."  What was the Gospel which Paul preached? Why, that which was taught by Jesus Christ, Peter, and the rest of hisapostles—baptism for the remission of sins, &c.We now refer you to John, the forerunner of Christ, who preached faith in the Son of God, and baptism for the remission of sins. We read that "all Judea andJerusalem came to John, to be baptized of him in Jor-dan, confessing their sins; and John testifies of him (Jesus) and said, I indeed baptize you with water, but

 he that cometh after me shall baptize you with the HolyGhost and with fire. Then cometh Jesus from Galileeto Jordan, unto John, to be baptized of him; but Johnforbade him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me? Jesus answered and said untohim, Suffer it to be so now, to fulfil all righteousness:then he suffered him; and Jesus, when he was baptized,went up straightway out of the water, and lo! theheavens were opened upon him, and he saw the Spiritof God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him: and lo! a voice from heaven, saying, This is my belovedSon, in whom I am well pleased." [##Matthew 3:13-17##] If it were necessarythat the Saviour, who was a holy Being, should be bap-tized, in order to fulfil all righteousness, and to obtainthe approbation of his Father—how much more neces-sary it is that we, being unholy, should be baptized forthe remission of our sins, that we may lay claim to the promises of God. We find, in ##John 3:2-5|John, iii.##, that "Nico-demus came to Jesus by night, to inquire concerningthese things; and Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily I say unto thee, Except a man be bornagain, he cannot see the kingdom of God. Nicodemusinquired, how can these things be? Jesus answered, Verily, verily I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God." Thus we see that these same principles weretaught by our Lord Jesus Christ. Many persons be-lieve that the Saviour intended this in a spiritual sense:whereas, Jesus distinctly said, of the water and of the Spirit.Now, we can no where, in the teachings and sayingsof the Saviour, find anything that can justify the customof sprinkling, because the Redeemer said, "Except aman be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enterthe kingdom of God." Now, we know that the word birth, as it is here signified, is a transition from one ele-ment to another; and this could not possibly take placeunless a man go down into the water, and becomeburied in it. Paul, in writing to the Romans, says, "Know ye not, that as many of us as were baptizedinto Jesus Christ, were baptized into his death? Therefore, we are buried with him by baptism intodeath, that like as Christ was raised up from the deadby the glory of the Father, even so we should walk inthe newness of life: for if we have been planted togetherin the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the like-ness of his resurrection.

 been baptized into Christ, have put on Christ." [##Galatians 3:27##] Bap-tize, in the original, signifies to immerse—to overwhelm. Now, unless we are buried in the water like unto JesusChrist, we cannot be said to be buried with him by bap-tism. Neither can we expect to receive the approbationof the Father, by setting aside the ordinance of his Son,and substituting one in its stead, which has been madeby man—which sprinkling evidently has, since it is no-where to be found in the New Testament. We con-sider that baptism, by immersion, is equally necessaryfor our salvation, as faith, repentance, and the gift of the Holy Ghost. We also consider, that all the com-mandments of God are equally essential to be observed, as Jesus said, "He that believeth and is baptized, shall be saved: he that believeth not, shall be damned." [##Mark 16:16##]These are the Saviour's words; we have neither addednor taken from them. We will farther refer you to ##Acts 10|Acts, x.,## which speaks of Cornelius, a devout man, and one that feared God with all his house—which gavemuch alms to the people and prayed to God alway.  Notwithstanding all this, Cornelius was commanded byan angel to send for Peter, to tell him what he ought todo. When Peter came, he preached unto him Jesus.  While he yet spake, the Holy Ghost fell upon all of them which heard the word, for they heard them speak with tongues and magnify God. Then answered Peter,Can any man forbid water that these should not be bap-tized, which have received the Holy Ghost as well aswe? And he commanded them to be baptized, in the name of the Lord. This evidently proves that baptismis essential, notwithstanding that the Holy Ghost hadbeen already poured out; if not, then the heavenlymessenger had been sent in vain. This is the only in-stance on record wherein we read of the Holy Ghost being poured out previous to baptism.We will farther refer you to the ##Acts 9|9th chapter## of Acts,and bring before you in testimony, the circumstances of Paul's conversion while on his way to Damascus,whither he was directed, that he might be informed ofall things which were appointed for him to do, by one Ananias, a servant of God. Ananias said unto him,"Why tarriest thou? arise and be baptized, and washaway thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord." [##Acts 22:16##] Wemight give various other testimonies; for instance, Philip and the Eunuch, who stopped the chariot at thefirst water, that he might obey the ordinance of bap-tism (although he had, but a few moments previous to

 THE DESERET WEEKLY. 517President WoodruffSaid:  I do not think anyone cantell the hour of the coming of theSon of Man. I think those thingshave been sufficiently revealed tous; so that we need not look for thetime of that event to be made known. I will say here that in my dreams I have had a great manyvisits from the Prophet Joseph since his death. The last time I met himwas in the spirit world. I methim at the Temple. Hespoke to me. Calling meby name, he said, "I cannot stop to talk to you, for I am in a hurry." I met Father Smith. He, too, said to me, "I am in a hurry." I met a great many of the Apostles and oth-ers who are in the spirit world, and they all seemed to be in a hurry. Imarveled at this, and wondered very greatly in my mind why any-body should be in a hurry in the Paradise of God.I had an interview with the Prophet Joseph afterwards and asked him the question, "Why are you all in such a hurry here?" I said, "I have alwaysbeen in a hurry in the world sinceI was born, but I thought there would be no occasion for it when Idied and entered the spirit world." He replied, "Well, I will tellyou: The Prophets and Apostles in this dispensation have had no timenor opportunity to prepare themselvesto go to the earth with the great bridegroom when He goes to meet the bride, the Lamb's wife. We inthis dispensation have not had time. We have first as much work to per-form, to prepare ourselves as in otherdispensations." He said the timewas at hand for the coming of theSon of Man, for Christ to go forthin fulfilment of revelation and pro-phecy, to meet the bride, the Lamb's wife, the Church and Kingdom of God upon the earth. Says He,"That is not revealed to us, nornever will be until the hour comes; but we have much work to do to pre-pare ourselves for the event."I have always believed from the revelations that we never wouldknow the exact time of the comingof the Son of man; and I am moreconvinced of this from what the Prophet said to me in my dreams.I have had a many interviews with President Young since he died, a great many teachings fromhim, and from others who held im-portant positions here in the flesh, but who have gone into the spiritworld, and seem, in a measure tohave an interest and watch-careover the Church and Kingdom of God though they have passed to the other side of the veil. 
 FIFTY-FIRST SEMI-ANNUALCONFERENCE.PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFFRead a revelation through the Pro-phet Joseph Smith to Orson Pratt,given November 4th, 1830, as fol-lows:"1. My son Orson, hearken and hear andbehold what I, the Lord God, shall say untoyou, even Jesus Christ your Redeemer;2. The light and the life of the world; a light which shineth in darkness and the darknesscomprehendeth it not;3. Who so loved the world that he gave hisown life, that as many as would believe mightbecome the sons of God: wherefore you aremy son,4. And blessed are you because you have believed;6. [5.] And more blessed are you because you are called of me to preach my gospel,6. To lift up your voice as with the sound of a trump, both long and loud, and cry re-pentance unto a crooked and perverse gene-ration, preparing the way of the Lord forhis second coming;7. For behold, verily, verily I say unto you, the time is soon at hand, that I shall come in a cloud with power and great glory.8. And it shall be a great day at the time of my coming, for all nations shall tremble.9. But before that great day shall come, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon be turn-ed into blood, and the stars shall refuse their shining, and some shall fall, and great de-struction await the wicked:10. Wherefore lift up your voice and spare not, for the Lord God hath spoken; therefore prophesy, and it shall be given by the power of the Holy Ghost;11. And if you are faithful, behold, I am with you until I come;12. And verily, verily, I say unto you, I come quickly. I am your Lord and your Re-deemer. Even so. Amen."Brother Woodruff said if he was to express his desires to the Lord it would be, O Lord, give us grace thatwe may be able to accomplish the work required of us. But O, the chains that bind this immortal spirit! Sometimes he felt, O thathe could break the bands of mortal-ity and open his eyes in the spiritworld to receive that which Orson Pratt is now enjoying. But we must be patient and be willing toabide our time. It would be impos-sible to give the history of that greatman or to depict the glory that awaits him. It would take the trump of the sixth angel to do that.He had been associated withBrother Pratt many years; the firsttestimony he ever heard from him was in a house in Kirtland, in April,1834. He went with him to Mis-souri, in Zion's Camp. In travelinga thousand miles with the Prophet,those who were in that company re-ceived an experience that they can never forget. Men were reduced to mere skeletons with the cholera, and many died. Bro. Pratt, while suf-fering from its effects, manifested that indomitable will which has since been many times ex-hibited.He struggled with death and overcame by faith in God.Brother Pratt had lived longer in this Church, traveled more miles and preached more sermons thanany man in it. He had baptized thousands, and fulfilled the revela-tion just read. His garments wereclear from the blood of this genera-tion. He had studied and written more upon the gospel and upon sci-ence than any man in the Church. He had now gone home. It was allright. This event the speaker had expected for some months. Beforehe left on his late visit to St. George he laid his hands upon Bro. Prattand blessed him. This was record-ed in his journal which the histori-ans could read after the speaker'sdeath. If Bro. Pratt could speak to this assembly, after meeting with the Prophet Joseph and his breth-ren in the spirit world, he would say to the Apostles, the Seventies,the High Priests, the Elders, theLesser Priesthood, and the Saints,can you afford to spend one hour in neglect of this great work, upon thethings of this world?" The spirit ofBro. Pratt is alive to-day and will live as long as our heavenly Father lives. His testimony is closed, his voice is hushed in death, but it willnot be a great while for some of usbefore we hear it in the spiritworld. Let the living work whilethe day lasts. Bro. Pratt makes the ninth Apostle that had left us who came through Emigration Cañon in 1847. This enjoined us tobe also ready; to be faithful to God and the responsibility resting upon us. The speaker thanked God for the Gospel and Priesthood revealedand exhorted all to be faithful as saviors on Mount Zion, "Sleep on Brother Orson, then with thy quo-rum thou shalt meet in the bliss and spend eternal day. Amen."

 this, heard of Jesus for the first time). Both of thesepersons went down into the water, and came up straight-way out of the water. The Eunuch went on his way rejoicing. [##Acts 8:26-39##] We might also mention the jailor and hishousehold, and many others.We have given sufficient proof that baptism, by im-mersion, is one of the ordinances of the Gospel, and thatit was instituted by Jesus Christ.Now, we desire to show, that according to the orderof the Gospel, the Holy Ghost is to be conferred by thelaying on of hands. This ordinance ought also to beadministered by those who have authority from God, otherwise it is illegal. It should also be administered only to those persons who believe, repent, and are bap-tized for the remission of sins. See ##Acts 8:12|Acts, viii. 12,## "But when they believed Philip preaching the things con-cerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women."Again, ##Acts 8:14-17|verses 14 to 17##—"Now when the apostles, whichwere at Jerusalem, heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John, who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost: for as yet he was fallenupon none of them; only they were baptized in thename of the Lord Jesus. Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost." Here itis evident that they received the Holy Ghost by the lay-ing on of hands, for Simon, seeing that this was the case, offered them money, that he might receive that power: but he was rebuked for his wickedness, in sup-posing that the Holy Ghost could be purchased with money.For farther testimony, let us refer to ##Acts 19:4|Acts, xix. 4##—"Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the bap-tism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which should come after him—that is, on Jesus Christ. And when Paul had laid hishands upon them, the Holy Ghost came on them, andthey spake with tongues and prophesied." See, also,##Hebrews 6:2|Hebrews, vi. 2##—"Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, andof eternal judgment." Now, you discover in this pas-sage, that baptism is mentioned in the plural, which signifies, the baptism of water, and of the Holy Ghost; which was conferred by the laying on of hands—and that it is in accordance with the order of the ancient Apostolic Church.

 THE DESERET WEEKLY. 525President Woodruff.Said: I will say, as the question is often asked, "What do the Latter-day Saints believe in?" we feel dis-posed to read the Articles of Faithof the Church of Jesus Christ ofLatter-day Saints, and should therebe any strangers present, they mayunderstand our faith in this respect.The question is often asked, "Dothe Mormon people believe in theBible?" so the principles that are read will show our faith and belief appertaining to the Gospel of Christ.The articles were then read by Bishop Orson F. Whitney. They are here introduced:ARTICLES OF FAITHOf the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.1. We believe in God, the Eternal Father, and in His Son Jesus Christ,and in the Holy Ghost.2. We believe that men will bepunished for their own sins, and not for Adam's transgression.3. We believe that through theatonement of Christ all men may be saved, by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel.4. We believe that the ordinances are: First, faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; second, repentance; third,baptism by immersion for the remis-sion of sins; forth, laying on ofhands for the gift of the Holy Ghost.5. We believe that a man must be called of God by "prophecy and by the laying on of hands," by those who are in authority, to preach the Gospeland administer in the ordinancesthereof.6. We believe in the same organiza-tion that existed in the primitivechurch, viz.: apostles, prophets, past-ors, teachers, evangelists, etc.7. We believe in the gift of tongues,prophecy, revelation, visions, healing,interpretation of tongues, etc.8. We believe the Bible to be the word of God, as far as it is translatedcorrectly; we also believe the Book ofMormon to be the word of God.9. We believe all that God has re-vealed, all that He does now reveal,and we believe that He will yet revealmany great and important thingspertaining to the Kingdom of God.10. We believe in the literal gath-ering of Israel and in the restorationof the Ten Tribes. That Zion will bebuilt upon this continent. ThatChrist will reign personally upon theearth, and that the earth will be re-newed and receive its paradisic glory.11. We claim of the privilege of wor-shiping Almighty God according to the dictates of our conscience, and al-low all men the same privilege, letthem worship how, where or whatthey may.12. We believe in being subject tokings, presidents, rulers and magis-trates, in obeying, honoring and sus-taining the law.13. We believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, andin doing good to all men: indeed we maysay that we follow the admonition ofPaul, "We believe all things, we hopeall things," we have endured manythings, and hope to be able to endureall things. If there is anythingvirtuous, lovely or of good reportor praiseworthy, we seek after thesethings. —JOSEPH SMITH. 
 THE DESERET WEEKLY.  509President Wilford Woodruffnext addressed the assemblage, the following being the substance of what he said:It was his duty as a leader of this Church, as a Prophet, Seer and Reve-lator as he was called, to bear his tes-timony to what President Cannon hadjust said; for he had told the truth. He himself realized the delicate position which any of them were placed in when they touched upon political mat-ters; at the same time he was very glad that Brother Cannon had touched upon that subject so far.There were the Twelve Apostles. One part of their number—he did not know how many—were Democrats, the other Republicans; and it was so with every quorum in this Church and kingdom. He confessed that the spirit which he had seen manifested towards some of the Twelve, and that by othermen of high standing in the Church had pained him ex-ceedingly. It might be asked in what way? In the fist place, every man had as much right—Prophets, Apostles, Saints and sinners—to his political convictions as he had to his religious opinions. There was no necessity for quarrelling one with an-other, but there had prevailed a spirit,since the political division, among theLatter-day Saints which was greatlyto be deplored. As Brother Cannon had said, that spirit would lead them toruin, to sorrow and affliction, unless a different course was taken. He had seen some good men in the Church come together on these politi-cal matters and display a spirit that they had no business to. A good deal had been said about Brother John Henry Smith, and why he was a Republican. He took it up, and gave his views to the public. The question arose and was put straight out, "Is he going to apostatize? because a man cannot be a Latter-day Saint and a Republican!" That was the feeling. Others might think that a man could not be a Latter-day Saint and a Democrat as well. Now, a man could be both, and if we behaved our-selves and did what was right as Latter-day Saints they would not have any trouble. He, however, wanted to say to the congregation before him that all the devils in hell and on earth were united together to destroy this Church and Kingdom. Whether it was one in-dividual or a hundred, they labored to that end, and the Saints had to be careful to watch their position in these things. There was an election held recently in the North—the town of Logan—where the Republicans were victorious. They (the Presidency) were accused of guiding, directing and ordering, as it were, the operation of this; but such was untrue. Hehimself had sons who were both Republicans and Democrats but hehad never once in his life told either of them how to vote. God knew he had allowed them to do as they liked. He wanted the Apostles to do as they liked, also every other man in Israel; "but for God's sake don't quarrel; don't throw filth and dirt and non-sense at one another, because of anydifference on political matters." Let all present give heed to this. Let them go about their business and attend to their political affairs as they pleased; but do not quarrel. If there were any people on the face of this earth that ought to be full of unity, of faith, ofthe Holy Ghost and the revelations of heaven it was the congregation before him today.He thanked God from the bottom of his heart that he had lived to see this day—to see such a vast congregation as this in the valleys of these moun-tains. He had grown up and lived with the Church almost from its organ-ization, and when he remembered how few were now living in the flesh of those whom he knew in Kirtland or even Nauvoo, and who associated withthe Prophet Joseph, he marveled that his own life had been preserved so long.
