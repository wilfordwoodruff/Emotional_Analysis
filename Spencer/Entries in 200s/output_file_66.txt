 I have ever been willing  to assist any missionary  work, as donate to any  good cause, but yet am  unprepaired to say what  I can do in this case, as   I am in no way prepaired   to go on a mission at presont  but hope this explanation  will meet with your approval  and to hear from you soon    Respectfully  Hyrum Jones.    Let us say to him, we are in no   hurry, he can take what time  he needs, and when he settles  down again with his family,  and can do so he can report him-  self ready for a mission. J. F. S.

 St. John, Jan 13, 1895.    Pres. Wilford Woodruff  Salt lake City,    Dear Bro,    At last   I reply to yours of Dec. 13, 1894.    I would have answered sooner, could I   have answered, as I would like to have  done. My desire has always been that   if ever I were called on a mission,  that I could could reply, that I am   ready and willing to go where and   when asked. I am sorry to have   to report that I do not feel able   to go as soon as requested. I do not   like ^to^ state my reason, but no harm to   tell ^the^ truth. I am at present involved  to such an extent, that I can not see  how I can pick up and go so soon.    I would ask till April 1896,   instead of 1895. I am the adminustrater   of my mothers Estate, which I cannot have   settled up by April 13, 1895. I desire  to have everything settled up on my   accounts settled^Balanced^ before going. I feel  that I could perform a better mission   than I could to go under different  circumstances.

I consider  it a great honor to be counted  worthy to fill a mission. If I  understand the expense of going  on a mission and keeping a wife  and ten children, it will be  imposible to go on a mission at  the present time. Who ever suggested  my name to you as a missionary  either knew nothing of my circumstances  or had other objects in view besides  that of gocarrying the Gospel to  the nations of the earth.

Brother Petersen lost his wife by death about  2 weeks ago who left him with a family of  8 children, the oldest being a boy of 17 years. He  has the children with him and would like  to keep them together. It will be very difficult  for him to arrange this and go at the time  set which is October 26th next. He however  is willing to do as you wish but he thought  it proper to let you know his circumstances.  He will be pleased if you will answer  this and he will go or stay as your desire.    Very Respectfully    Your brother in the Gospel  James Jensen    Bishop of Grover Ward    [sideways text]  I think bro. Ole Petersen should be honorably released  from this call, until he is able to leave his children  safely, and go on his mission without loss. J. F. S.  [end of sideways text] 
 THE DESERT WEEKLY  PIONEER PUBLICATION OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAIN REGION.  ESTABLISHED JUNE, 1850.  TRUTH AND LIBERTY  NO. 15 SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH, SATURDAY, APRIL 6, 1889. VOL. XXXVIII.    DISCOURSE  Delivered by President Wilford Wood-  ruff, at Springville, Tuesday Morn-  ing, March 5th, 1889.    REPORTED BY ARTHUR WINTER.    Brethren and sisters: I feel to say,  God bless you. I am glad to meet   with you and have the privilege   of once more bearing my testimony  to the Gospel of Jesus Christ and   the Kingdom of God. What Brother   Cannon has told you with regard to   the work of the Lord, is true. I   have traveled in my day a great   many miles with the Prophet Joseph  Smith. I once heard him say that  if he were the emperor of the world   and had control of the whole human   family, we would defend every   man, woman and child in the en-  joyment of their religion, no matter   what their religion was, whether it   was true or false. He said they had   a right to that privilege, and the   exercise of that agency which   God had given to the whole human   family. Those were his sentiments.   They are my sentiments today. The   Revelator, St. John, represented to   us that there would be about six   hundred three-score and six differ-  ent religions upon the earth in these   last days—the number of the name   that was spoken of by him. Today   that number, I presume, is very   nearly filled. The whole Christian   world are as diverse in their views   and principles of religion and roads   to heaven or hell, as the stars are   diverse in their position in the   heavens. And while I would grant   this privilege that I have spoken of,  to all mankind, I claim the same   privilege for myself and for all our   people. We have a right to the en-  joyment of our religion and belief,   and to practice the same on the   earth; and all other sects and parties   have the same right.    Inasmuch as I claim this, I want   to give some of my views and tell   you my feelings with regard to the   Gospel of Jesus Christ. To com-  mence with, I will quote the words   of the Apostle Paul. You are doubt-  less familiar with Paul's history,   and know what a persecutor of the   Saints he once was, and how he  became converted to the truth; and  his conversion was so thorough and   complete that he finally laid down  his life in defense of the Gospel of   Christ. That same Paul said:    "Though we, or an angel from   heaven, preach any other gospel un-  to you than that which we have  preached unto you, let him be   accursed."    That was a strong declaration;   and to make it more emphatic, he   repeated it.    Now, brethren and sisters, and   friends, that Gospel which Paul   taught is what I believe in. It is   what I have believed in since I was   old enough to read the New Testa-  ment. My belief in that Gospel was   so strong that I never joined any   sect or denomination on the earth   until I heard a man preach to me

 450 THE DESERET WEEKLY    that Gospel. He held the Priest-  hood, and he taught me the same   Gospel that Paul taught. As many   of you have heard me remark   before, I went to Sabbath school, in   my boyhood, under Dr. Porter, in   Farmington, Connecticut. He and   Dr. Haws, of Hartford, Conn.,   were Presbyterian divines, and were   considered great men in that day.   In that Sabbath school I read the   New Testament. I learned verse   after verse and chapter after chap-  ter. What did the Testament teach   me? It taught me the Gos-  pel of life and salvation; it   taught me a Gospel of pow-  er before the heavens and on  the earth. It taught me that the   organization of the Church consist-  ed of Prophets, Apostles, Pastors   and Teachers, with helps and gov-  ernments. What for? "For the per-  fecting of the Saints, for the work  of the ministry: for the edifying   of the body of Christ, till we all   come in the unity of the faith and   of the knowledge of the Son of God,  unto a perfect man, unto the meas-  ure of the stature of the fulness   of Christ." These are the   things which I learned, and they  made an impression upon me.  I believed in them; yet I had never   heard them taught by any clergy-  man or divine upon the earth. In   my early manhood I attended the   meetings of almost every denomina-  tion there was. On one occasion I   attended one of those great meet-  ings which were sometimes held in  Connecticut, at which forty or fifty   ministers of various denominations   were gathered together. They   prayed for a pentecostal season and   for a good many other things. At   this meeting permission was given   for anybody to make remarks. I   was quite young then. I arose and   stepped into the aisle, and I said to   that body of ministers: "My   friends, will you tell me why you   don't contend for the faith once de-  livered to the Saints? Will you tell   me why you don't contend for that   Gospel that Jesus Christ taught, and   that His Apostles taught? Why do   you not contend for that religion that  gives unto you power before God,   power to heal the sick, to make the   blind to see, the lame to walk, and  that gives you the Holy Ghost and   those gifts and graces that have been   manifest from the creation of the   world? Why do you not teach the   people those principles that the  ancient Patriarchs and Prophets   taught while they were clothed with   the revelations of God? They had  the administrations of angels; they  had dreams and visions, and con-  stant revelation to guide and direct   them in the path in which they   should walk." The presiding elder  said: "My dear young man, you  would be a very smart man, and a   very useful man in the earth, if you  did not believe all those foolish   things. These things were given   to the children of men in the dark   ages of the world, and they were   given for the very purpose of en-  lightening the children of men in   that age, that they might believe in   Jesus Christ. Today we live in the  blaze of the glorious gospel light,   and we do not need those things."   Said I: "Then give me the dark   ages of the world; give me those   ages when men received these prin-  ciples."    There is where I stood in my   youth. I did not believe that these   gifts and graces were done away,   only through the unbelief of the   children of men. They were done   away when men rejected the law of  the Gospel of Jesus Christ; turned   away from the Kingdom of God,   built up altars to Baal, and sought   to carry out principles of their own.   And the earth remained in that con-  dition until the Lord raised up a   Prophet in these last days. He   raised up Joseph Smith, who laid   the foundation of this Church and   Kingdom. And from that day un-  til the present, whenever any one   has embraced the Gospel of Christ   and lived that religion, the gifts and   blessings of that Gospel have been   bestowed upon them. And this   will be so unto the end.    I have traveled many thousands   of miles, at home and abroad,   preaching the Gospel of Christ to   my fellow-men; and, in my experi-  ence, I have never known a man or   woman who, when they received   the Gospel with honest hearts and   were baptized, did not receive a tes-  timony for themselves. While in   England, in 1840, I was inspired of   the Lord to go to Herefordshire.  There had never been any Elders in   that part of the country. When I   arrived there I found about six hun-  dred people called United Brethren.   They had broken off from the Wes-  leyan Methodists. They sought for  those ancient gifts that I have been   speaking about. They had been   praying to God to open the way be-  fore them. What was the conse-  quence? All of them, except one,   including forty-five preachers, were   baptized in thirty days. They re-  ceived the Gospel, and the gifts and  graces followed them.    As I said before, these are the   principles that I believe in. And I   will say here that this same Gospel  was with Father Adam, with Noah,   with Enoch, and with all the an-  cient patriarchs and prophets.   There has been no change. And I   say, as a servant of God, there is no   change in the eternal and everlast-  ing Priesthood. It is without be-  ginning of days or end of years. It   is from eternity unto eternity. By   the power of that Priesthood, God,   our Eternal Father, has organized   all worlds, and redeemed all worlds   that have ever been redeemed. By   that same Priesthood men have ad-  ministered on the earth in the or-  dinances of the Gospel of Christ.   There is no change to the Gospel of  Jesus Christ, nor to one of the or-  dinances thereof. And whenever   that Gospel is offered to the children   of men, it is by the power of the  Priesthood. No man who has ever   breathed the breath of life, since   God made the world, has ever had   the power to go forth and minister   in one of the ordinances of the Gos-  pel of Christ, without that Priest-  hood; and no man ever will. This   may not be believed by many of the   inhabitants of the earth; but it is   true.    We have been gathered to these   valleys of the mountains by the   power and inspiration of God. We   might have gone forth and preached  till we had become as old as Methu-  selah, and if the power of the Al-  mighty had not attended that   preaching, Utah might still have  been a desert. But the Spirit of God   bore record to the teachings of the   Elders of Israel, and the honest in  heart and meek of the earth re-  ceived the Gospel and gathered to   these valleys. This is in fulfill-  ment of the revelations of God.   John the Revelator, in his vision on   the Isle of Patmos, saw "another an-  gel fly in the midst of heaven, hav-  ing the everlasting Gospel to preach   unto them that dwell on the earth,   and to every nation, and kindred,   and tongue, and people, saying with   a loud voice, Fear God and give   glory to Him; for the hour of His   judgment is come." [##Revelation 14:6-7##] Those words   have been fulfilled. The angel of   God has visited the earth and deliv-  ered the fulness of the Gospel unto   the inhabitants thereof, and they are  receiving it. By the power of that   Gospel you left your homes and came  to these mountains of Israel.    Now, Paul says that if we preach   any other gospel than that which he   taught, we should be accursed. [##Galatians 1:8##] The   first principle in that Gospel is faith  in Christ as the Savior of the world.

 THE DESERET WEEKLY. 451  When men have faith, then they are   required to repent of their sins and  be baptized for the remission of sin.   This is what Jesus Christ taught,   and He set the example himself.   Though He committed no sin, He   went unto John the Baptist and de-  manded baptism of him. John the   Baptist said he was not worthy to do   it. But Jesus said, "Suffer it to be   so now; for thus it becometh us to  fulfill all righteousness." [##Matthew 3:15##] After be-  ing baptized it is necessary that we   should have hands laid upon us   by men holding the Holy Priesthood,   for the reception of the Holy Ghost.   Now, if you have the Holy Ghost   with you—and every one ought to  have—I can say unto you that there   is no greater gift, there is no greater   blessing, there is no greater testimo-  ny given to any man on earth. You  may have the administration of an-  gels; you may see many miracles;   you may see many wonders in the   earth; but I claim that the gift of   the Holy Ghost is the greatest gift  that can be bestowed upon man. It   is by this power that we have per-  formed that which we have. It is   this that sustains us through all the  persecutions, trials and tribulations  that come upon us. We also have   the gifts of the Spirit among us. I   can bear testimony that the sick   have been healed, the blind have   been made to see, the deaf to hear   and the lame to walk, and devils  have been cast out, by the power of   God. These gifts and graces have  been with this people from the or-  ganization of the Church until the   present hour. There sits a man   [pointing to Brother Philo Dibble ]   who, fifty-five years ago, while in  Jackson County, Missouri, was shot  through the body because of his re-  ligion. If it had not been for the   power of God, which was manifest-  ed in his behalf, he would have gone  to the grave. Other men have been  in like circumstances. The Lord has  taken whom He pleased and when   He pleased, and preserved in life   those whom He would preserve, ac-  cording to the counsel of His own  will. I bear record that these gifts   are enjoyed by this people, according   to their faithfulness before God. If   we lack these things, it is because   we do not live our religion; for if   we do our duty before the Lord, those   blessings will be with us.    Brethren and sisters, the Lord has  set His hand, in fulfillment of the   words of the Prophet Daniel, to es-  tablish His Kingdom once more and   for the last time on the earth and to   prune His vineyard with a mighty   pruning. [##Daniel 2:26-47##] He has called men and   ordained them and sent them forth  to prune the vineyard for the last   time, before the judgments of God   overtake the world. [##Jacob 5:61-77##] These princi-  ples are true, and if we will do our   duty, the blessings of God will at-  tend us. The Lord has set His hand   to call forth His Church out of the   wilderness. The world has been in   darkness and error from the day   that Jesus and His disciples died. The  Lord took the Priesthood to Him-  self. He left the Christian and the   Jewish world without the Gospel of  Christ, without a solitary man who   had power to administer in the or-  dinances of the Gospel. These are   the truths of heaven, and I bear re-  cord of them to all men, and   you will find that they are true when   you go into the presence of God. If   the Lord ever fulfills His predictions,   it is quite time that He began to   have a people on the earth who will   acknowledge His name. The time   has come when God is going to per-  form His work. If you want to   know what is going to take place,   read the Bible. Let the Christian  world read the Bible; they don't be-  lieve the Book of Mormon or the   Doctrine and Covenants. Let them   see what the Revelator St. John says  is going to take place in the last days.   Read of the opening of the seals,   the pouring out of the plagues the   turning of the rivers and the seas into  blood, and of the death and judge-  ment that are going to overtake the   world. John wrote these things as he  was moved upon by the Holy Ghost,   and his words will come to pass. [##Revelation 6-9##]  We are living in a great day.   These mountains are filled with Lat-  ter-day Saints, in fulfillment of   the revelations of God. The Lord   has commenced this work, and He   is not going to leave it. I warn all   men of that. Zion is going to be  built up. Zion is going to be establish-  ed. Zion is going to be clothed with   the glory of God. And the Kingdom   of God will be like the little  stone cut out of the mountain with-  out hands; it will fill the whole   earth, and prepare the way for the   coming of the Son of Man.    Brethren and sisters, this is my   testimony. This is the religion that   I believe in. Have not I a right to  believe in it? I say I have. I say   to every Methodist, to every Catho-  lic, to every Presbyterian, and to all,   you have a right to your own belief.   We have a little time to dwell here  in the flesh. I shall soon be called  to go into the presence of God,   and I am willing to meet all the  world there with regard to my testi-  mony. I know my testimony is   true. I know Joseph Smith's testi-  mony is true. I know he sealed his   testimony with his blood. It re-  quired his blood, apparently, to  seal this dispensation, as it did the  blood of Jesus and the prophets of   old, to seal their dispensations.    Brethren and sisters, I want to see   you faithful. I want you to be   saved in the Kingdom of God. I   want to be saved, too. What is gold,  what is silver, what is honor, what   is the glory of this world? It all per-  ishes with the using. Where are the   ancient prophets and apostles? They   have fallen asleep. Where are the  generations that have existed before   us? They have gone to sleep. Our   forefathers are in the spirit world. I   shall very soon follow them, I ex-  pect. So will you. Our future des-  tiny lies on the other side of the   vail. When I die I want the priv-  ilege of going where God my   Heavenly Father is, and where   Jesus Christ, the Savior of the  world is— He who taught the doc-  trines that Brother Cannon and I   are teaching you today, and that the   Elders of Israel have taught from  the commencement of this work. I   want to dwell with them, and with   our people who have been true and   faithful to God. I believe God will   save all people, except the sons of   perdition, in some glory. There is   a glory of the sun; there is a   glory of the moon, and a glory of   the stars, as one star differeth from   another star in glory, so is the resur-  rection of the dead. [##Doctrine and Covenants 76:50-113##] All sects, all   parties, all people, except those who   shed innocent blood or commit un-  pardonable sin, will have a glory ac-  cording to their condition and the   lives they have lived on the earth.   As Brother Cannon has said, God   offers the Gospel to a generation, and  if they reject that Gospel it will   cost them dearly. It is a serious   thing for any dispensation to reject   the Gospel of Christ and to shed the   blood of the prophets. What did it   cost to shed the blood of the Savior?   He came to His Father's house— the   Jews. He brought the Gospel to  them, and warned them of the  wrath to come. But they rejected   the Gospel; they crucified Him and   put Him to death. [##Matthew 27:35##] What did it cost  them? Jesus told them himself what   it would cost them. He said: "And   they shall fall by the edge of the   sword, and shall be led away cap-  tive into all nations; and Jerusalem   shall be trodden down by the Gen-  tiles, until the times of the Gentiles  are fulfilled." [##Luke 21:24##] That yoke has been  upon the Jewish nation until the   present day, and it is not broken

I am very greatful for the opportunity to preach  the gosple in my native Land, for I know it is one of the  principle duties of a servant of god to promulgate the  gosple in the World. My financial affairs are not very flattering  I have 3 acres of ground in the shape of city lots valued at $300.00  to help support my fammilie of 7 persons while I am gone I there-  fore have to depend largly upon the aid of the people for the  nessisary means to go. I believe the people will do all in their  power to help me.

 452 THE DESERT WEEKLY    yet, and will not be until   the times of the Gentiles are   fulfilled, which is close at our   door. Look at Jerusalem after Christ  was slain. Look at the trouble and   suffering the Jews endured in the   great war against Jerusalem, under   Titus. Twelve hundred thousand   people were taken out of the gates    Jerusalem and fell by the famine   and by the sword. A remnant was   scattered throughout the world, and   remains in that condition today. At   the present time they are persecuted in  Russia, in Austria, in Germany,   and in other nations of the earth.   They will be persecuted until Christ   comes, or near that time.    It is the same in this generation,   and in every generation in which   God has had a people upon the earth.   It costs something to shed the blood   of righteous men.    I say to the Latter-day Saints, do   your duty, honor God and remem-  ber your covenants. I want these   young men and young women of   Israel to honor God, to honor their   parents, and remember their pray-  ers. This Kingdom has got to rest  upon your heads. The world do not   believe these things; but their un-  belief does not make the truths of   God of none effect. Therefore, I   have a right to urge these young  men to qualify themselves and pre-  pare themselves to take the places  of their fathers, and to honor God  and be united. United you stand,   divided you fall. Union is that   which God requires of us, as a peo-  ple. I hope you will lay these things  to heart. Read in the Bible and   you will find that they are true, and   they will have their fulfillment.   God bless you. Amen.

 The word of the Lord to the Citizens of London,   of every sect and denomination: and to every indi-  vidual into whose hands it may fall—showing forth   the plan of Salvation, as laid down in the New   Testament: namely, Faith in our Lord Jesus  Christ—Repentance—Baptism for the Remission of   Sins—and the Gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying   on of hands. Presented by two of the Elders of  the Church of Jesus Christ, of Latter Day Saints.    FEELING an anxious desire for the salvation of souls,  we now lay before the world those principles which  were taught by our Lord Jesus Christ, and his   apostles; and as we implicitly believe the word of   God, we declare that a full salvation cannot be ob-  tained, except through obedience to all the command-  ments laid down in the New Testament. Our Lord  Jesus Christ, previous to his ascension, gave this  commission to his apostles: "Go ye into all the   world and preach the gospel to every creature; he  that believeth and is baptized, shall be saved: but   he that believeth not, shall be damned; and these  signs shall follow those that believe: in my name  they shall cast out devils—they shall speak with new   tongues—they shall take up serpents—and if they   drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them—they   shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover."  Luke (chap. xxiv. 45—50) writes, that he (Jesus)   then opened their understandings, that they might  understand the Scriptures, and said unto them, Thus  it is written, thus it behoveth Christ to suffer, and to   rise from the dead the third day; and that repentance  and remission of sins should be preached in his name  among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem; and ye   are witnesses of these things, and behold I send the   promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the   city of Jerusalem until ye be endowed with power  from on high; and he led them out as far as to  Bethany, and he lifted up his hands and blessed  them. Thus we see that the apostles, notwithstand-  ing all the teachings and the many instructions which   they had received from their Lord during a three

The following statement of the doctrines of the Church was issued with the approval of the Prophet   Joseph Smith:    1. We believe in God, the Eternal Father, and in His Son Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Ghost.  2. We believe that men will be punished for their own sins, and not for Adam's transgression.  3. We believe that through the atonement of Christ all mankind may be saved, by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the   Gospel.  4. We believe that these ordinances are: First, Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; second, Repentance; third, Baptism by im-  mersion for the remission of sins; fourth, Laying on of hands for the Gift of the Holy Ghost.  5. We believe that a man must be called of God, by "Prophecy, and by the laying on of hands," by those who are in   authority to preach the Gospel and administer in the ordinances thereof.  6. We believe in the same organization that existed in the primitive church, viz.: Apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers,   evangelists, etc.  7. We believe in the gift of tongues, prophecy, revelation, visions, healing, interpretation of tongues, etc.  8. We believe the Bible to be the word of God, as far as it is translated correctly: we also believe the Book of Mormon to be  the word of God.  9. We believe all that God has revealed, all that He does now reveal, and we believe that He will yet reveal many great and   important things pertaining to the Kingdom of God.  10. We believe in the literal gathering of Israel and in the restoration of the Ten Tribes; that Zion will be built upon this   continent; that Christ will reign personally upon the earth, and that the earth will be renewed and receive its paradisic glory.  11. We claim the privilege of worshiping Almighty God according to the dictates of our conscience, and allow all men the   same privilege, let them worship how, where, or what they may.  12. We believe in being subject to kings, presidents, rulers, and magistrates, in obeying, honoring, and sustaining the law.  13. We believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and in doing good to all men; indeed, we may say that we  follow the admonition of Paul. "We believe all things, we hope all things," we have endured many things, and hope to be able to   endure all things. If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report, or praiseworthy, we seek after these things.    GENERAL AUTHORITIES OF THE CHURCH, 1896.    First Presidency--Wilford Woodruff, George Q.

 AN ADDRESS.    To the Officers and Members of the   Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-  day Saints:    The near approach of the date for   the dedication of the Temple of our   God moves us to express with some   degree of fullness our feelings to our   brethren, the officers of the Church   who with us bear the Priesthood of the   Son of God, and to the Latter-day   Saints generally; to the end that in  entering into that holy building we   may all be found acceptable ourselves,   with our households, and that the   building which we shall dedicate may   also be acceptable unto the Lord.    The Latter-day Saints have used   their means freely to erect other   Temples in these valleys, and our   Father has blessed us in our   efforts. Today we enjoy the great   happiness of having three of these   sacred structures completed, dedicated   to and accepted of the Lord, wherein   the Saints can enter and attend to  those ordinances which He, in His   infinite goodness and kindness, has re-  vealed. But for forty years the hopes,   desires, and anticipations of the entire   Church have been centered upon the  completion of this edifice in the prin-  cipal city of Zion. Its foundation was   laid in the early days of our settle-  ment in these mountains; and   from that day until the present,   the eyes of the members of the   Church in every land have been   lovingly directed toward it. Looking   upon it as the Temple of Temples, the   people during all these years have   labored with unceasing toil, undi-  minished patience and ungrudging   expenditure of means to bring it to   its present condition of completion;   and now that the toils and the sacri-  fices of forty years are crowned so   successfully and happily; now that   the great building is at last finished   and ready to be used for divine pur-  poses, need we say that we draw near  an event whose consummation is to   us as a people momentous in the   highest degree? Far-reaching in its   consequences as that occasion is certain   to be, what remains for us to say in   order to impress the entire Church   with a sense of its tremendous im-  portance!    On this point, surely nothing; yet  may we offer a few words upon a phase  that directly touches it. No member   of the Church who would be deemed   worthy to enter that sacred house can   be considered ignorant of the prin-  ciples of the Gospel. It is not too much   to presume that every one knows what  his duty is to God and to his fellow   man. None is so forgetful as to have  lost sight of the admonition that we   must be filled with love for and   charity toward our brethren. And   hence none can for a moment doubt   the supreme importance of every  member of the congregation being at   peace with all his or her brethren and  sisters, and at peace with God. How   else can we hope to gain the blessings  He has promised save by complying   with the requirements for which those   blessings are the reward!    Can men and women who are vio-  lating a law of God, or those who are  derelict in yielding obedience to His   commands, expect that the mere going  into His holy house and taking   part in its dedication will render them   worthy to receive, and cause them to  receive, His blessing?    Do they think that repentance and  turning away from sin may be so   lightly dispensed with?    Do they dare, even in thought, thus   to accuse our Father of injustice and   partiality, and attribute to Him care-  lessness in the fulfillment of His own   words?    Assuredly no one claiming to belong   to His people would be guilty of such   a thing.    Then must those who are unworthy   cease to expect a blessing from their  attendance at the Temple while sin  unrepented of still casts its odor about   them, and while bitterness or even an  unforgiving coolness exists in their  hearts against their brethren and sis-  ters.    On this latter subject we feel that   much might be said. In the striving   after compliance with the apparently   weightier matters of the law, there is  a possibility that the importance of   this spirit of love and kindness and   charity may be underestimated. For  ourselves, we cannot think of any   precept that at present requires more   earnest inculcation.    During the past eighteen months  there has been a division of the   Latter-day Saints upon national party   lines. Political campaigns have been   conducted, elections have been held,   and feelings, more or less intense,   have been engendered in the minds   of brethren and sisters upon one side  and the other.    We have been cognizant of conduct

 Ephraim Utah Feb 20. 1896.    President Wilford Woodruff.  Salt Lake City.    Dear Brother.    In answer to your esteemed of Jan 31th,  will say, That the idea of a foreign mission  to my native contry Norway, was received  with satisfaction. I feel like it would be a  source of happiness to go an tell my people  that I was not decived when I embraced  what is called Mormonism as I have tasted  some of the sweets which follow obedience  to the gospil of Christ.    Since the arrival of your latter, I have been  trying to dispose of property so that I could  pay my debts, and get mony to go with, but  as yet without success. What I have to sell  is mainly Ephraim City property and as we  know that such has suffered more by the  depressions in value then farming land. I stand  a poor chance at present. In counciling with  my Bishop and one of his councelors,

 years' sojourn with him, were not fully qualified to   preach the gospel—they had not been endowed with   power from on high. In testimony of this, turn to   the ##Acts 2:1-4|2nd chapter## of Acts, which reads thus: "And   when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were  all with one accord in one place: and suddenly there  came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty  wind, and it filled all the house where they were sit-  ting: and there appeared unto them cloven tongues   like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them: and  they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began   to speak with other tongues as the Spirit gave them  utterance." These things caused the people to mar-  vel; some said they were drunk, but Peter, standing  up with the eleven, said, "Ye men of Judea, and all  ye that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto you,  and hearken to my words—these are not drunken, as   ye suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the day;   but this is that which was spoken by the Prophet  Joel: And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith  God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh, and   your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and  your young men shall see visions, and your old men  shall dream dreams: and on my servants, and on my  handmaidens, I will pour out in those days of my  Spirit, and they shall prophesy." [##Acts 2:14-18##] Now, we observe,   that the apostles, after having received the Holy  Ghost, were clothed with power, and began to preach   unto the people Jesus crucified; and they being   pricked to the heart, cried out, "Men and brethren,   what shall we do?  Then Peter said unto them, re-  pent and be baptized every one of you in the name of  Jesus Christ, for the remission of sins, and ye shall   receive the gift of the Holy Ghost: for the promise  is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are   afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call.   And with many other words did he testify and ex-  hort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward  generation. Then they that gladly received his word  were baptized, and the same day were added unto   them three thousand souls." [##Acts 2:37-41##]

 and have heard of many expressions  that have been very painful to us and  have grieved our spirits.    We know they have been an offense  unto the God of peace and love, and  a stumbling-block unto many of the  Saints.    We feel now that a time for recon-  ciliation has come; that before   entering into the Temple to pre-  sent ourselves before the Lord in   solemn assembly, we shall divest our-  selves of every harsh and unkind feel-  ing against each other; that not only   our bickerings shall cease, but that the  cause of them shall be removed, and  every sentiment that prompted and  has maintained them shall be dispelled;  that we shall confess our sins one to  another, and ask forgiveness one of  another; that we shall plead with the  Lord for the spirit of repentance, and,  having obtained it, follow its prompt-  ings; so that in humbling ourselves  before Him and seeking forgiveness  from each other, we shall yield that  charity and generosity to those who  crave our forgiveness that we ask for  and expect from Heaven.    Thus may we come up into  the holy place with our hearts free  from guile and our souls prepared for  the edification that is promised! Thus  shall our supplications, undisturbed by  a thought of discord, unitedly mount  into the ears of Jehovah and draw  down the choice blessings of the God  of Heaven!    As your brethren, sustained by your  vote and in your faith as the First  Presidency of the Church, we have  this to say to the Latter-day Saints, in  our individual as well as our official  capacity: If there is a single member  of the Church who has feelings against  us, we do not wish to cross the  threshold of the Temple until we have  satisfied him and removed from him  all cause of feeling, either by explana-  tion or by making proper amends and  atonement; neither would we wish to  enter the sacred portals of that edifice  until we have sought an explanation,  or amends, or atonement from  any against whom we may have  either a real or fancied grievance.    In now announcing this course for  ourselves, we say to all the other offi-  cers of the Church that we desire them  to follow our example. We wish them  from the highest to lowest and throughout  all the Stakes and Wards of Zion to  take heed of this counsel. Let them  invite all who may have feelings  against them to come forward and  make them known; let them then en-  deavor to correct any misapprehen-  sions or misunderstandings which may  exist, or give redress for any wrong or  injury that may have been done.    We say the same—and when the offi-  cers have taken the course indicated  we wish them to say the same—to the  individual members of the Church.   We call upon them to seek to have the  fellowship of their brethren and their  sisters, and their entire confidence  and love; above all to seek to have the  fellowship of their brethren and their  sisters, and their entire confidence  and love; above all to seek to have the  fellowship and union of the Holy  Ghost. Let this spirit be sought and  cherished as diligently within the  the smallest and humblest fam-  ily circle as within the  membership of the highest organiza-  tion and quorum. Let it permeate the  hearts of the brothers and sisters, the  parents and children of the household,  as well as the hearts of the First Presi-  dency and Twelve. Let it mellow  and soften all differences between  members of the Stake Presidencies and  the High Councils, as well as between  neighbors living in the same ward.   Let it unite young and old, male and  female, flock and shepherd, people and  Priesthood in the bonds of gratitude  and forgiveness and love, so that  Israel may feel approved of the Lord,  and that we may all come  before Him with a conscience  void of offense before all men. Then  there will be no disappointment as to  the blessings promised those who sin-  cerely worship Him. The sweet  whisperings of the Holy Spirit will be  given to them and the treasures of  Heaven, the communion of angels, will  be added from time to time, for His  promise has gone forth and it cannot  fail!    Asking God's blessing upon you all  in your endeavor to carry out this  counsel, and desirous of seeing it take  the form of a united effort on the part  of the whole people, we sug-  gest that Saturday, March 25th, 1893,  be set apart as a day of fasting and  prayer. On that occasion we advise  that the Presidencies of Stakes, the  High Councils, the Bishops and their  Counselors, meet together with the  Saints in their several meeting houses,  confess their sins one to another, and  draw out from the people all feelings  of anger, of distrust, or of unfriendli-  ness that may have found a lodgment;  so that entire confidence may then  and there be restored and love from  this time prevail through all the con-  gregations of the Saints.

Robert Davidson Bp 
 By this we plainly see, that the promise of the Holy   Ghost was not confined to the apostles, neither to that nor   any other particular age of the world; for Peter dis-  tinctly and positively said to you and to your children—to  them that are afar off—even as many as the Lord our God  shall call. [##Acts 2:39##] Now, if this promise of the Holy Ghost was  to continue, then, certainly, faith, repentance, baptism,   must continue also: as the Holy Ghost was granted as   the seal of their obedience unto these ordinances. If   one of these principles be not essential, you may lay   aside the whole, since all are equally the commandments   of God. In proof of this, the Saviour, in the last chapter  of Matthew, says, "Go ye, therefore, and teach all na-  tions, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of   the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: teaching them to ob-  serve all things, whatsoever I have commanded you.  And lo! I am with you alway, even unto the end of the   world. Amen." [##Matthew 28:19-20##] Now, every person possessing common  sense, must allow, that when the Saviour said all things  he did not mean apart. The question is frequently   asked, on hearing a quotation from the word of God,  "What does it mean?" We wish to be distinctly un-  derstood, that when the Lord speaks, or reveals his  word unto the children of men, he means just what he   says. The manner in which the word of God has been   spiritualised, and the diverse interpretations which have   been given by commentators and teachers of the people,  in this day and generation of the world, is one great  cause of the apostasy of the churches of the present day   from the ancient Apostolic Religion. There has evi-  dently been a departure from the faith once delivered to  the Saints. Of this the many different systems is a  sufficient proof, as the Scriptures teach us that there is   one Lord, one faith, one baptism, and one body, as set  forth by Paul, in ##1 Corinthians 12:12-27|Cor. xii.## In ##Galatians 1:8-9|Gal. i.##, the apostle also   says, "Though we, or an angel from heaven, preach   any other Gospel unto you than that which we have   preached unto you, let him be accursed."  What was   the Gospel which Paul preached? Why, that which   was taught by Jesus Christ, Peter, and the rest of his  apostles—baptism for the remission of sins, &c.    We now refer you to John, the forerunner of Christ,   who preached faith in the Son of God, and baptism for   the remission of sins. We read that "all Judea and  Jerusalem came to John, to be baptized of him in Jor-  dan, confessing their sins; and John testifies of him   (Jesus) and said, I indeed baptize you with water, but

 he that cometh after me shall baptize you with the Holy  Ghost and with fire. Then cometh Jesus from Galilee  to Jordan, unto John, to be baptized of him; but John  forbade him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee,   and comest thou to me? Jesus answered and said unto  him, Suffer it to be so now, to fulfil all righteousness:  then he suffered him; and Jesus, when he was baptized,  went up straightway out of the water, and lo! the  heavens were opened upon him, and he saw the Spirit  of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him:   and lo! a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved  Son, in whom I am well pleased." [##Matthew 3:13-17##] If it were necessary  that the Saviour, who was a holy Being, should be bap-  tized, in order to fulfil all righteousness, and to obtain  the approbation of his Father—how much more neces-  sary it is that we, being unholy, should be baptized for  the remission of our sins, that we may lay claim to the   promises of God. We find, in ##John 3:2-5|John, iii.##, that "Nico-  demus came to Jesus by night, to inquire concerning  these things; and Jesus answered and said unto him,   Verily, verily I say unto thee, Except a man be born  again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. Nicodemus  inquired, how can these things be? Jesus answered,   Verily, verily I say unto thee, Except a man be born of   water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of   God." Thus we see that these same principles were  taught by our Lord Jesus Christ. Many persons be-  lieve that the Saviour intended this in a spiritual sense:  whereas, Jesus distinctly said, of the water and of the   Spirit.    Now, we can no where, in the teachings and sayings  of the Saviour, find anything that can justify the custom  of sprinkling, because the Redeemer said, "Except a  man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter  the kingdom of God." Now, we know that the word   birth, as it is here signified, is a transition from one ele-  ment to another; and this could not possibly take place  unless a man go down into the water, and become  buried in it. Paul, in writing to the Romans, says,   "Know ye not, that as many of us as were baptized  into Jesus Christ, were baptized into his death?   Therefore, we are buried with him by baptism into  death, that like as Christ was raised up from the dead  by the glory of the Father, even so we should walk in  the newness of life: for if we have been planted together  in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the like-  ness of his resurrection.

 been baptized into Christ, have put on Christ." [##Galatians 3:27##] Bap-  tize, in the original, signifies to immerse—to overwhelm.   Now, unless we are buried in the water like unto Jesus  Christ, we cannot be said to be buried with him by bap-  tism. Neither can we expect to receive the approbation  of the Father, by setting aside the ordinance of his Son,  and substituting one in its stead, which has been made  by man—which sprinkling evidently has, since it is no-  where to be found in the New Testament. We con-  sider that baptism, by immersion, is equally necessary  for our salvation, as faith, repentance, and the gift of   the Holy Ghost. We also consider, that all the com-  mandments of God are equally essential to be observed,   as Jesus said, "He that believeth and is baptized, shall   be saved: he that believeth not, shall be damned." [##Mark 16:16##]  These are the Saviour's words; we have neither added  nor taken from them. We will farther refer you to   ##Acts 10|Acts, x.,## which speaks of Cornelius, a devout man, and   one that feared God with all his house—which gave  much alms to the people and prayed to God alway.    Notwithstanding all this, Cornelius was commanded by  an angel to send for Peter, to tell him what he ought to  do. When Peter came, he preached unto him Jesus.    While he yet spake, the Holy Ghost fell upon all of   them which heard the word, for they heard them speak   with tongues and magnify God. Then answered Peter,  Can any man forbid water that these should not be bap-  tized, which have received the Holy Ghost as well as  we? And he commanded them to be baptized, in the   name of the Lord. This evidently proves that baptism  is essential, notwithstanding that the Holy Ghost had  been already poured out; if not, then the heavenly  messenger had been sent in vain. This is the only in-  stance on record wherein we read of the Holy Ghost   being poured out previous to baptism.    We will farther refer you to the ##Acts 9|9th chapter## of Acts,  and bring before you in testimony, the circumstances of   Paul's conversion while on his way to Damascus,  whither he was directed, that he might be informed of  all things which were appointed for him to do, by one   Ananias, a servant of God. Ananias said unto him,  "Why tarriest thou? arise and be baptized, and wash  away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord." [##Acts 22:16##] We  might give various other testimonies; for instance,   Philip and the Eunuch, who stopped the chariot at the  first water, that he might obey the ordinance of bap-  tism (although he had, but a few moments previous to

 THE DESERET WEEKLY. 517    President Woodruff    Said:  I do not think anyone can  tell the hour of the coming of the  Son of Man. I think those things  have been sufficiently revealed to  us; so that we need not look for the  time of that event to be made   known. I will say here that in my   dreams I have had a great many  visits from the Prophet Joseph since   his death. The last time I met him  was in the spirit world. I met  him at the Temple. He  spoke to me. Calling me  by name, he said, "I cannot stop to t  alk to you, for I am in a hurry." I   met Father Smith. He, too, said to   me, "I am in a hurry." I met a   great many of the Apostles and oth-  ers who are in the spirit world, and   they all seemed to be in a hurry. I  marveled at this, and wondered   very greatly in my mind why any-  body should be in a hurry in the   Paradise of God.    I had an interview with the   Prophet Joseph afterwards and   asked him the question, "Why   are you all in such a hurry   here?" I said, "I have always  been in a hurry in the world since  I was born, but I thought there   would be no occasion for it when I  died and entered the spirit world."   He replied, "Well, I will tell  you: The Prophets and Apostles in   this dispensation have had no time  nor opportunity to prepare themselves  to go to the earth with the great   bridegroom when He goes to meet   the bride, the Lamb's wife. We in  this dispensation have not had time.   We have first as much work to per-  form, to prepare ourselves as in other  dispensations." He said the time  was at hand for the coming of the  Son of Man, for Christ to go forth  in fulfilment of revelation and pro-  phecy, to meet the bride, the Lamb's   wife, the Church and Kingdom of   God upon the earth. Says He,  "That is not revealed to us, nor  never will be until the hour comes;   but we have much work to do to pre-  pare ourselves for the event."    I have always believed from the   revelations that we never would  know the exact time of the coming  of the Son of man; and I am more  convinced of this from what the   Prophet said to me in my dreams.    I have had a many interviews   with President Young since he   died, a great many teachings from  him, and from others who held im-  portant positions here in the flesh,   but who have gone into the spirit  world, and seem, in a measure to  have an interest and watch-care  over the Church and Kingdom of   God though they have passed to   the other side of the veil. 
 FIFTY-FIRST SEMI-ANNUAL  CONFERENCE.    PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF    Read a revelation through the Pro-  phet Joseph Smith to Orson Pratt,  given November 4th, 1830, as fol-  lows:    "1. My son Orson, hearken and hear and  behold what I, the Lord God, shall say unto  you, even Jesus Christ your Redeemer;    2. The light and the life of the world; a light   which shineth in darkness and the darkness  comprehendeth it not;    3. Who so loved the world that he gave his  own life, that as many as would believe might  become the sons of God: wherefore you are  my son,    4. And blessed are you because you have   believed;    6. [5.] And more blessed are you because you   are called of me to preach my gospel,    6. To lift up your voice as with the sound   of a trump, both long and loud, and cry re-  pentance unto a crooked and perverse gene-  ration, preparing the way of the Lord for  his second coming;    7. For behold, verily, verily I say unto you,   the time is soon at hand, that I shall come   in a cloud with power and great glory.    8. And it shall be a great day at the time of   my coming, for all nations shall tremble.    9. But before that great day shall come, the   sun shall be darkened, and the moon be turn-  ed into blood, and the stars shall refuse their   shining, and some shall fall, and great de-  struction await the wicked:    10. Wherefore lift up your voice and spare   not, for the Lord God hath spoken; therefore   prophesy, and it shall be given by the power   of the Holy Ghost;    11. And if you are faithful, behold, I am   with you until I come;    12. And verily, verily, I say unto you, I   come quickly. I am your Lord and your Re-  deemer. Even so. Amen."    Brother Woodruff said if he was   to express his desires to the Lord it   would be, O Lord, give us grace that  we may be able to accomplish the   work required of us. But O, the   chains that bind this immortal   spirit! Sometimes he felt, O that  he could break the bands of mortal-  ity and open his eyes in the spirit  world to receive that which Orson   Pratt is now enjoying. But we   must be patient and be willing to  abide our time. It would be impos-  sible to give the history of that great  man or to depict the glory that   awaits him. It would take the   trump of the sixth angel to do that.    He had been associated with  Brother Pratt many years; the first  testimony he ever heard from him   was in a house in Kirtland, in April,  1834. He went with him to Mis-  souri, in Zion's Camp. In traveling  a thousand miles with the Prophet,  those who were in that company re-  ceived an experience that they can   never forget. Men were reduced to   mere skeletons with the cholera, and   many died. Bro. Pratt, while suf-  fering from its effects, manifested   that indomitable will which has   since been many times ex-  hibited.    He struggled with death   and overcame by faith in God.  Brother Pratt had lived longer in   this Church, traveled more miles   and preached more sermons than  any man in it. He had baptized   thousands, and fulfilled the revela-  tion just read. His garments were  clear from the blood of this genera-  tion. He had studied and written   more upon the gospel and upon sci-  ence than any man in the Church.   He had now gone home. It was all  right. This event the speaker had   expected for some months. Before  he left on his late visit to St. George   he laid his hands upon Bro. Pratt  and blessed him. This was record-  ed in his journal which the histori-  ans could read after the speaker's  death. If Bro. Pratt could speak to   this assembly, after meeting with   the Prophet Joseph and his breth-  ren in the spirit world, he would   say to the Apostles, the Seventies,  the High Priests, the Elders, the  Lesser Priesthood, and the Saints,  can you afford to spend one hour in   neglect of this great work, upon the  things of this world?" The spirit of  Bro. Pratt is alive to-day and will   live as long as our heavenly Father   lives. His testimony is closed, his   voice is hushed in death, but it will  not be a great while for some of us  before we hear it in the spirit  world. Let the living work while  the day lasts. Bro. Pratt makes   the ninth Apostle that had left us   who came through Emigration   Cañon in 1847. This enjoined us to  be also ready; to be faithful to God   and the responsibility resting upon   us. The speaker thanked God for   the Gospel and Priesthood revealed  and exhorted all to be faithful as   saviors on Mount Zion, "Sleep on   Brother Orson, then with thy quo-  rum thou shalt meet in the bliss and   spend eternal day. Amen."

 this, heard of Jesus for the first time). Both of these  persons went down into the water, and came up straight-  way out of the water. The Eunuch went on his way   rejoicing. [##Acts 8:26-39##] We might also mention the jailor and his  household, and many others.    We have given sufficient proof that baptism, by im-  mersion, is one of the ordinances of the Gospel, and that  it was instituted by Jesus Christ.    Now, we desire to show, that according to the order  of the Gospel, the Holy Ghost is to be conferred by the  laying on of hands. This ordinance ought also to be  administered by those who have authority from God,   otherwise it is illegal. It should also be administered   only to those persons who believe, repent, and are bap-  tized for the remission of sins. See ##Acts 8:12|Acts, viii. 12,## "But   when they believed Philip preaching the things con-  cerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus   Christ, they were baptized, both men and women."  Again, ##Acts 8:14-17|verses 14 to 17##—"Now when the apostles, which  were at Jerusalem, heard that Samaria had received the   word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John, who,   when they were come down, prayed for them, that they   might receive the Holy Ghost: for as yet he was fallen  upon none of them; only they were baptized in the  name of the Lord Jesus. Then laid they their hands   on them, and they received the Holy Ghost." Here it  is evident that they received the Holy Ghost by the lay-  ing on of hands, for Simon, seeing that this was the   case, offered them money, that he might receive that   power: but he was rebuked for his wickedness, in sup-  posing that the Holy Ghost could be purchased with   money.    For farther testimony, let us refer to ##Acts 19:4|Acts, xix. 4##—  "Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the bap-  tism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they   should believe on him which should come after him—  that is, on Jesus Christ. And when Paul had laid his  hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came on them, and  they spake with tongues and prophesied." See, also,  ##Hebrews 6:2|Hebrews, vi. 2##—"Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of   laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and  of eternal judgment." Now, you discover in this pas-  sage, that baptism is mentioned in the plural, which   signifies, the baptism of water, and of the Holy Ghost;   which was conferred by the laying on of hands—and   that it is in accordance with the order of the ancient   Apostolic Church.

 THE DESERET WEEKLY. 525    President Woodruff.    Said: I will say, as the question is   often asked, "What do the Latter-  day Saints believe in?" we feel dis-  posed to read the Articles of Faith  of the Church of Jesus Christ of  Latter-day Saints, and should there  be any strangers present, they may  understand our faith in this respect.  The question is often asked, "Do  the Mormon people believe in the  Bible?" so the principles that are   read will show our faith and belief   appertaining to the Gospel of Christ.    The articles were then read by   Bishop Orson F. Whitney. They   are here introduced:    ARTICLES OF FAITH  Of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day   Saints.    1. We believe in God, the Eternal   Father, and in His Son Jesus Christ,  and in the Holy Ghost.    2. We believe that men will be  punished for their own sins, and not   for Adam's transgression.    3. We believe that through the  atonement of Christ all men may be   saved, by obedience to the laws and   ordinances of the Gospel.    4. We believe that the ordinances   are: First, faith in the Lord Jesus   Christ; second, repentance; third,  baptism by immersion for the remis-  sion of sins; forth, laying on of  hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost.    5. We believe that a man must be   called of God by "prophecy and by   the laying on of hands," by those who   are in authority, to preach the Gospel  and administer in the ordinances  thereof.    6. We believe in the same organiza-  tion that existed in the primitive  church, viz.: apostles, prophets, past-  ors, teachers, evangelists, etc.    7. We believe in the gift of tongues,  prophecy, revelation, visions, healing,  interpretation of tongues, etc.    8. We believe the Bible to be the   word of God, as far as it is translated  correctly; we also believe the Book of  Mormon to be the word of God.    9. We believe all that God has re-  vealed, all that He does now reveal,  and we believe that He will yet reveal  many great and important things  pertaining to the Kingdom of God.    10. We believe in the literal gath-  ering of Israel and in the restoration  of the Ten Tribes. That Zion will be  built upon this continent. That  Christ will reign personally upon the  earth, and that the earth will be re-  newed and receive its paradisic glory.    11. We claim of the privilege of wor-  shiping Almighty God according to   the dictates of our conscience, and al-  low all men the same privilege, let  them worship how, where or what  they may.    12. We believe in being subject to  kings, presidents, rulers and magis-  trates, in obeying, honoring and sus-  taining the law.    13. We believe in being honest,   true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and  in doing good to all men: indeed we may  say that we follow the admonition of  Paul, "We believe all things, we hope  all things," we have endured many  things, and hope to be able to endure  all things. If there is anything  virtuous, lovely or of good report  or praiseworthy, we seek after these  things. —JOSEPH SMITH. 
 THE DESERET WEEKLY.  509    President Wilford Woodruff  next addressed the assemblage, the   following being the substance of what   he said:    It was his duty as a leader of this   Church, as a Prophet, Seer and Reve-  lator as he was called, to bear his tes-  timony to what President Cannon had  just said; for he had told the truth. He   himself realized the delicate position   which any of them were placed in   when they touched upon political mat-  ters; at the same time he was very   glad that Brother Cannon had touched   upon that subject so far.    There were the Twelve Apostles. One   part of their number—he did not know   how many—were Democrats, the other   Republicans; and it was so with every   quorum in this Church and kingdom.   He confessed that the spirit which he   had seen manifested towards some of   the Twelve, and that by other  men of high standing in the   Church had pained him ex-  ceedingly. It might be asked in   what way? In the fist place, every   man had as much right—Prophets,   Apostles, Saints and sinners—to his   political convictions as he had to his   religious opinions. There was no   necessity for quarrelling one with an-  other, but there had prevailed a spirit,  since the political division, among the  Latter-day Saints which was greatly  to be deplored. As Brother Cannon   had said, that spirit would lead them to  ruin, to sorrow and affliction, unless a   different course was taken. He had   seen some good men in the   Church come together on these politi-  cal matters and display a spirit that   they had no business to. A good deal   had been said about Brother John   Henry Smith, and why he was   a Republican. He took it up,   and gave his views to the public. The   question arose and was put straight   out, "Is he going to apostatize? because   a man cannot be a Latter-day Saint   and a Republican!" That was the   feeling. Others might think that a   man could not be a Latter-day Saint   and a Democrat as well. Now, a man   could be both, and if we behaved our-  selves and did what was right as   Latter-day Saints they would not have   any trouble. He, however, wanted to   say to the congregation before him that   all the devils in hell and on earth were   united together to destroy this Church   and Kingdom. Whether it was one in-  dividual or a hundred, they labored to   that end, and the Saints had to be   careful to watch their position in   these things. There was an election   held recently in the North—the town   of Logan—where the Republicans were   victorious. They (the Presidency)   were accused of guiding, directing and   ordering, as it were, the operation   of this; but such was untrue. He  himself had sons who were both   Republicans and Democrats but he  had never once in his life told either   of them how to vote. God knew he   had allowed them to do as they liked.   He wanted the Apostles to do as they   liked, also every other man in Israel;   "but for God's sake don't quarrel;   don't throw filth and dirt and non-  sense at one another, because of any  difference on political matters." Let   all present give heed to this. Let them   go about their business and attend to   their political affairs as they pleased;   but do not quarrel. If there were any   people on the face of this earth that   ought to be full of unity, of faith, of  the Holy Ghost and the revelations of   heaven it was the congregation before   him today.    He thanked God from the bottom of   his heart that he had lived to see this   day—to see such a vast congregation   as this in the valleys of these moun-  tains. He had grown up and lived   with the Church almost from its organ-  ization, and when he remembered how   few were now living in the flesh of   those whom he knew in Kirtland or   even Nauvoo, and who associated with  the Prophet Joseph, he marveled that   his own life had been preserved so   long. When they passed behind the
