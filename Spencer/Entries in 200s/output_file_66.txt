I would like to have Emigration continue as fast as doors are open either by sea or lands. But I think it right for us to see our way clear in charter- ing ships.—by getting subscriptions among the Saints for that purpose before running any risks, that would be detrimental to the course and a disadvantage to the Church. I like the spirit manifested by Mr. Benson with my interview with him yesterday. And as far as you can, do business with him as cheap as elsewhere. I would prefer to continue business with him, as he apparently manifests much interest in our welfare. I hope the Lord will open your way to get a goodly number out by fall if not before. Bro.

ENDENTRY    adopted at the recent conference of the  Elders at Salt Lake City is, with the ex- ception of the article expressing obedience to the law, identical with the original declaration drawn up and promulgated in 1842 by JOSEPH SMITH, the founder of the sect. It therefore — although the Elders may not be aware of the fact — affords an opportunity of an early test of the genuine- ness of one at least of the Divine revela- tions which SMITH claimed to have re- cieved. Both declarations contain the following article: "We believe in the  " literal gathering of Israel and in the  " restoration of the ten tribes; that Zion " will be built upon this continent; that " CHRIST will reign personally upon the " earth, and that the earth will be renewed " and receive its Paradisiacal glory." Now, in his "Autobiography," SMITH told his followers that it had been revealed to him when the second coming of CHRIST would take place. He did so in the fol- lowing passage: "I was once praying " very earnestly to know the time of the " coming of the Son of Man when I heard " a voice repeat the following: 'JOSEPH, " ' my son, it thou livest until thou art " ' eighty-five years old, thou shalt see " ' the face of the Son of Man; there- " ' fore, let this suffice, and trouble me " ' no more in this matter,'" As JOSEPH was born on December 23, 1805, this "re- "velation" fixes as the same date of the present year as the time of the second coming. On that day, then, the honesty of the founder of Mormonism will be put to the test. Should the "revelation" prove to have been incorrect it will, of course, be open to the  present head of the Church to assert that he also has had one explaining the diffi- culty in a satisfactory manner, just as he has had one authorizing him to throw polygamy overboard at a time when its retention had become embarrassing and was likely to prove disastrous to the  Church. But this will not do. Either the "revelation" made to JOSEPH SMITH is true or it is not. If on December 23 next we find that it is not, there will be even more reason than ever to believe the  founder of Mormonism to have been a  rank imposter. As it is, no one outside of the Mormons themselves believes other- wise of him, bit it will be satisfactory to have even at this late day a new proof of his imposture.     from a visit to the British Columbia, reports that the Calgary exhi- bition, the experiment farms at Brandon, and several other places, he saw samples of  two-rowed barley equal, if not superior, to any he had ever seen.

The  army is now in Winter Quarters, we shall defend ourselves as long as we can, then burn every thing and flee to the Mountains; we all feel it to be more honorable to even loose our lives in maintaining those rights and blessing guaranteed unto us by the Constitution and Laws of our  Country, than to longer submit to tyranny, oppression and  religious persecution.
