Lake City, on September 15th, 16th, and 17th, 1891,  attracting wide-spread interest and promises to be very largely attended by representative people from all of the western states and many others from the east. In order that strangers in the city at that time, may be given a proper idea of Salt Lake City and her people, the General Committee of Arrangements has thought  that there would be no better way of accomplishing that result and at the same time, affording our visitors an enjoyable event, than to have the Choral Society and other musical organizations of the city, give a grand Musical Festival, in the great  17th, 1891.   Society have been requested to arrange a Festival, this they have consented to do, provided the consent of yourself and associates can be obtained for the use of the Tabernacle on that occasion.   grant the use of the Tabernacle as above indicated. This Musical Festival is to be complimentary to members attending the Congress and in order that they may cover expenses the Choral Society merely wishes the privilege of charging a nominal popular price of admission.   consideration, we remain,   Jno W.

Some of the brethren here are considering the advisability of me leaving my public obligations in the present shape, as it appears that none is prepared to relieve me, and a little confusion might result from the change. Another view is that if I should decline to "run" again at the next election, when my term is out, that would create susspicion; provided I am around home. So far as, I am personally concerned I wish only to say, that I have made up my mind to do the will of the ^Lord^ and what- ever He dictate through His servants shall be my choice.
