 The documents sent for by Brother Franklin S. Richards have been sent in part. Thedispatches requesting them found us in a bad positionto supply that which he asked for. All our doc-uments were taken hurriedly out of the HistorianOffice and were not left in such an orderly manneras to enable anyone to readily find any documentthat might be needed. Not only did it require athorough search of all papers, but unfortunately the person who knew their whereabouts was not in thecity. This has occasioned great delay. A batch ofdocuments were sent yesterday; some more will besent to-day, though we fear, from Brother Richards'dispatch, that those sent to-day will not be in timeto answer his purpose. Our attorneys in the Legislaturehave been so busily employed that it was almost im-possible for them to spare the time at once to getup affidavits of the kind required. If they had hada little more time, they could have arranged better;but the Legislature being so near the close of its sessionnecessarily compelled them to spend the greater part

BOX B.Salt Lake City, U. T. March 13th 1888.Elder Joseph F. Smith,Washington, D. C.Dear Brother Joseph F.:Your esteemed favor of the 7th inst. has just been received, containing a state-ment of the amount of funds left in the hands of Brother John T. Caine, and many particulars whichare very interesting to us concerning your movementsthere.We are not surprised at what we hearfrom you respecting the action of Brother John W. Young; but we regret very much that he shouldfeel to draw off or to be wounded at the course thatwe have taken with him. We can only repeat 
 of benefit to our cause and be the means of givingCongress and the country a better knowledge of theaction of our Constitutional Convention, &C. It wouldseem to us that this perhaps might be done by himto advantage. As you are on the ground, however,and can see all the reasons for and against such a course, we think it better to submit this questionto you.Naturally speaking, we should say, makethe speech, if it could be made carefully and witha conservative tone. But there may be reasons, theweight of which we cannot fully realize here, for deem-ing such a course impolitic under present circumstances.You, doubtless, have opportunities by this time toconsult with our friends. We think it would be well,therefore, for you to converse freely with them uponthis subject and get their views concerning it. If theysee no grave objection to a speech of this character,we certainly would be very much in favor of it.In our reply to Brother Caine, we have told 
 Silver m^M^ine the (Emma not Excepted) we willpresent them with as good a silver l^L^ode as theaverage [Lads] of Utah or n^N^evada can produce(for we have them). b^B^ut see the money in the i^I^ron businessThe ambition of the Officers and Stock holders of theUtah Iron Mining Company is to be able to not onlycompete for the local Iron trade of the Rocky Mountainsand Pacific Coast but to claim a n^N^iche for f^F^ame in thegreat National c^C^entenial Temple to be Erected in the city of Phili^a^delphia in^A^D 1876 for the best Qualityof American Iron and Steel.Trusting s^S^ir that while the precious metals ofUtah ca^l^aim and hold so ave^a^riciously the timetalant and money of a resptable number of ourcapp^i^talist that her statesmen will continue as theyhave done to Encourage the m^M^anufacture of Ironc^C^otton Wool and Silk we have and shall ^continue to^ have the proudgratification to be co workers in Uta^i^lizeing the n^N^aturalproducts of the Earth for the benefit of Man.Your 
 of their time in that body, or great injury might bedone by hasty and ill-considered legislation.I have had a quorum of the Twelvewithin reach now for some little time past. I thinkit important that when needed we can have a quorumof our Council, so that the responsibility may be borneby the Quorum. Questions are constantly arising ofan important character, and I do not wish any ofus to be placed in a position where it could be saidby absent ones that if they had been present theyshould have recommended a different policy. Besides,I think it due to the brethren that having theresponsibility they should have the opportunity of giv-ing their views. We had a meeting last night;there were present nine of the Twelve—myself, BrothersE. Snow, F. D. Richards, Geo. Q. Cannon, B. Young, M. Thatcher, F. M. Lyman, J. H. Smith, and H. J. Grant.Respecting ex-Senator Pomeroy, youwill learn, doubtless, considerable from Maude and howfar he can be trusted. 
 him that we should correspond with you upon thesubject, and that we desired him to consult with youand to be governed by your suggestions and counsel,whether to make the speech or not.The article which Brother Penrose sent to us, I am clearly of the opinion, should not be pub-lished at the present time. I am fully persuadedthat our enemies would take advantage of it; andwhile it would be limited in its circulation andwould reach but comparatively few hands, the com-ments made upon it and misrepresentations of itwould be widely circulated. If an announcement ofthis kind is to be made at all from us, we are ofthe opinion that it would be better to come fromBrother Caine on the floor of the House thanfrom the columns of the News.We write this without stopping to giveyou any local news, much of which you can gainfrom the newspapers. 
 what we have said several times before, that wehave not had the most distant idea of doing any-thing, in any form, to hurt his influence, to deprivehim of any credit, or to, in any manner, curtail himin any of his legitimate labors. It would have beena great pleasure to us to have seen him take such a course in our transactions that we could have spokenwith unqualified praise concerning his labors, and givenhim every credit to which he could be in the leastdegree entitled. If we fail in making him believethat these are our feelings, then we do not think weare to blame, though we are sorry to be so unfortun-ate, for these are our genuine feelings and theyhave been in all that we have said and done. Butwe have felt that while we were willing to accordhim all this, he should also respect us in ourplace sufficiently to communicate to us the purposesfor which he wished to obtain money and alsothe directions in which he intended to operate, notfor any personal gratification to us, or to yield 
 I see no objections to your paying for theclippings which you mention in your last favor. Ofcourse, if they are of no benefit to you there, it is notworth while paying for them; but if they are, the pricefor a clipping is not much more than would have tobe paid for the paper containing it, if we had to buyit ourselves.With love to yourself, Brothers John W. Young,John T. Caine, F. S. Richards, C. W. Penrose, L. J. Nuttall,and Geo. F. Gibbs, and still praying the Lord to bewith you in all your deliberations and movements, andto preserve you from the hands of your enemies,We remain,Your Brethren,Wilford WoodruffGeo. Q.

 deference to any power that we might assume tohave, but because by so doing we could work tobetter advantage, as we would know whether hewas interfering with other agencies that were operatingin our behalf, with which he was not familiar; andalso that we might be able to account in a propermanner to the Church and the people at large forthe proper disposition of the public funds whichthey, in their confidence, had placed in our handsto be expended as our judgment and the Spirit ofthe Lord would suggest to us as proper. It seemsto us that the requests we have made of BrotherJohn W. have been very simple and that theyshould not have injured his feelings or wounded hispride. We certainly have not intended to ask any-thing more of him than is required of us by thosewho have entrusted funds in our keeping.We are glad that you have been able toobtain direct communication with No. 3, and that you 
 We regret that Brother John W. Young shouldfeel as you describe. His expressions concerning beingleft in the lurch or being crushed have no founda-tion in fact. There has been no such dispositionmanifested by the Committee towards him. We havetreated him with all the consideration and respectthat could be reasonably asked. Certainly we have tried to treat him with more courtesy than we thinkwe have received. If he will only reflect as he shoulddo, he will see that there has been no manifestationon our part to do him the least injury, or to treathim in any way that should displease an honorableand upright man. The Committee certainly have ask-ed no more from him than they themselves areexpected to perform. Money is placed in theirhands; but they will have to account for its expendi-ture; and this is but reasonable. Confidence cannot bemaintained in any other way. We owe it to ourselvesand our future reputations that we should be able to render a strict account of all that passes through ourhands, so that no suspicion can arise as to our

The generalhope is that you have been able to make satisfactoryarrangements with the Guion Co. The feelings of thebrethren are very strongly in favor of that Company, aswe know your own are. Bro Geo. Teasdale has writtena number of letters upon the subject of maintaining ourold relations with the Guion Co. and seemed to begreatly exercised over the danger there appeared to beof our connection with it being broken.We have been much embarrassed by thedivision of views which appear to exist between ourlegal counsel.

We stayed together till11 o'clock and then had to break up somewhat abruptlyto return to our quarters or we might have been kepthours longer. We have made another appointment forto-morrow evening.We had a very plain talk with him.I (President Woodruff) spoke quite plainly to him con-cerning the position that you and the other brethren were in at his house, and that some arrangement shouldbe made about it; that his refusal to take pay foryour board, &C., placed you in a very delicate position.He made quite an explanation in reply to this; saidthat he had proposed to accept the pay on donationto the Fund, and he had also proposed that the expensesof the house be kept for one month and be dividedproportionately. We asked him how this had resulted,and he said the month had not yet expired. He 
 to be discouraged at the results of this investigationbefore the Senate Committee. On the contrary, it isvery encouraging to know that there has been such aclear exposition of the truth, and evidence so incontro-vertible given concerning the conduct of officials inthis Territory and other matters pertaining to thegeneral situation.The visits which are being made bythe brethren to the leading men, as we have oftensaid, cannot fail to be of great good. It is mission-ary work that has a direct influence upon our case,and in taking this course we do our duty and leavea responsibility upon them which they would nothave to bear if it were not for the information thatis thus imparted to them. It may be that thiscourse, in some instances, will only make those who ^are^disposed to endeavor to thwart us more active intheir operations; but it will certainly raise up manyfriends, modify prejudice, and dissipate much of the 
 This division appears unfortunate. We have sent Bro.Richards word ^by telegraph^ to day (as we thought, perhaps, youmight be in New York) giving him the views of ourattorneys here and leaving the matter for the decisionof the attorneys at Washington. Under the circumstances, we think this the best we can do, as time is so short.There is another question underlying allthis, which we have had forced upon us, and that is,If No. 5's view is correct concerning the probable decisionof U. S. Supreme Court respecting the constitutionality ofthe law, is it a wise thing for us to push our caseto such a decision? Some attorneys here favor doingthis, even if the decision should be adverse. But it isa matter that should be very well considered in all itsbearings, and on this account we telegraphed you theother evening to hear from you what the united wishesand views of yourselves and our friends would be uponthis question.Respecting the employment of Shellaberger

Some of the items whichhave been paid do not belong to us as a State Com-mittee to pay Mr. Gibson's salary, &c.We have had another communicationfrom Maude since our last to you; it was dated NewYork. He stated that he had not yet met you; thatyou were absent, he thought, when he was at Washing-ton. He had been in New England, arranging aboutnewspapers, and writes quite encouragingly.

Forty thousand dollarswas a large sum of money, and in our position wecould not possibly advance it without understandingmore about it than we did.

 Salt Lake City, January 22nd, 1896.Pres. Wilford Woodruff & Counselors,City,Dear Brethren:Since our conversation with you yesterday, and the agree-ment which was then made for the formation of a syndicate, and havingheard the expressions of yourselves and Brethren that you desired somearrangements made whereby your mining properties in Southern Nevadamight no longer be a burden to you, which they have thus far been, wehave given the subject careful consideration, and hereby make the follow-ing proposition to you for the management of the Sterling and Confidence properties:We will assume charge of both of these companies if you desire it onthe following conditions:(1) You are to temporarily carry the financial obligations whichyou have already contracted for this property, allowing us such reason-able time as you may think proper to allow for us to place the minesunder competent supervision and management, when we guarantee to gradual-ly relieve you of the debts incurred on these properties.(2) We are to receive the unsold treasury stock for division amongthe four members of the syndicate who now have no fincancial interest inthe company, viz: James Jack, Nephi W. Clayton, Frank J. Cannon andAbraham H. Cannon, who are to receive equal shares of this stock, whichamounts to about four thousand shares; also an equal share in any otherstocks which they^,^ with your moral influence^,^ can induce Brothers OrsonSmith and J. E. Langford to donate, in view of the fact that we are toassume all financial burdens with your heo^l^p, and to take active manage-ment of the company's affairs.(3) The sale of any or all of the property is only to occur withyour full approval and under your advice.Our intention is, should this proposition be acceptable to you, toimmediately secure capable men to locate at Sterling and Confidence.These men we would expect to for^e^see and provide for all necessities of the company so that the mills might be kept in constant operation. Wewould expect weekly reports from them, and all accounts, either forwages or supplies would be paid direct from this city, where the accounts, 
 and Wilson, upon receiving your telegram requesting ananswer, a reply was sent rather favoring the employmentof Mr. Wilson. Afterwards, on receiving your communi-cation and seeing the shape things were assuming inWashington, we thought it would be better not toemploy him at the present time, if you had not alreadydone so. We presume, however, that you probably haddone so before we sent the second telegram.We gather from your remarks that BrotherJohn W. Young has had several persons whom he hasretained, and to whom he has been giving pay. It isjust as well that you should keep as clear from themas you can consistently with the honorable fulfillment ofany arrangements that he may have made.As for Mr. Curtis, we think that hisconnection with us had better cease at the close of theyear, which, we suppose, will be on the 15th May, ac-cording to his statement. It would be well probablyfor Bro. F. S. Richards to notify him to this effect, 
 present method of operations will not result in accomplish-ing the end we have in view. He thought political re-sources ought to be exhausted before missionary workshould be engaged in. Upon being interrogated as towhat he meant by this, he spoke in a vague sort of away about the nine Senators who had met at SenatorCall's, and that they ought to have been kept togetherand more added to them, and they made missionariesfor us, to convert others; and in this connection alludedto excursions which they frequently took and dinners whichthey often had together, and that they ran in "sets", andthat in this way one might be made to convert theother. We could not see why the present action ofthe brethren in visiting Members and Senators andenlightening them concerning the true position of affairsin Utah should interfere in the least with such aplan as he had in view, and asked him how thiscould interfere; why the two plans could not workharmoniously. Upon this point we did not get 
 you can.The land boom here is the chief excitementwe have among us at the present time. It amountsto almost a craze in some quarters. The city is fullof people buying land or talking about it. Realestate agents are multiplying on every hand. Priceshave gone up wonderfully. Some idea of the infatu-ation that has seized upon the people can be formedby noticing an item in last Sunday's Herald, inwhich it was stated that 32 acres near Geo. Q. Cannon'swere sold for $600.00 an acre. You know whatkind of land it is in that vicinity and how littlevalue it possesses intrinsically for farming or forresidences.The Legislative Assembly had a very pro-tracted legislative day; it did not close until just aftermidnight on Saturday night, the 10th inst.

Whether this man is the one or notwe cannot say; but we shall learn as quickly as possible.We are glad that the brethren are able toreach such men as Senators Pugh and McPherson andcorrect the misconceptions which they entertained concerningus and our conduct, and we trust that the effect willbe better upon them than the interview with SenatorDavis appears to have had on himWe meet on all sides expressions ofregret at the utterances of the speakers at Conference. 
 satisfaction. He evidently thinks, and so expressedhimself, that money is the all-important factor to beused. Upon this our views were expressed with greatfrankness, that we did not believe in a money campaign;we had not money enough, we thought, to spend in the way he indicated. While money is doubtless nec-essary for various purposes, and might be used judiciouslyto aid men who are in straits, to use it as he proposedwas entirely contrary to our feelings and we think itmost impolitic. It would undoubtedly make the "lobby"hungry, and it would come to the knowledge of theseacute fellows that we were spending money. No mancould receive it scarcely without somebody being awareof it. He did not agree with us on this; he thoughtthat his method of using means would only be knownto himself and the parties. He appeared to thinkthat the great difficulty with him was that he couldnot sit down and write and explain things as other mendid; he was more for action; and it was to this that

Heyielded more than our folks did, and most of themembers felt very well satisfied with what they gained.There has been a disposition, however, to expend morelavishly than our funds would altogether warrant; butone heavy expense was cut off—that asked for by theDirectors of the Insane Asylum. The members werefirm in resisting this, though the Governor had beenlobbied with by friends of the Asylum to veto the Appropriation bill unless the amount they asked forshould be inserted. Doubtless the action of theselobbyists contributed to the veto in the first place ofthe Reform School bill and the Agricultural Collegeappropriation. The banking bill passed, but not inas good shape as we would like; still it is thoughtwe can organize under it.Steps will be taken to have propercredentials sent down for our sisters to represent ourTerritory in the approaching convention. 
 Our friends declare that great injury has been done bywhat was said, and they expressed a feeling of shame,because these utterances seem to put them in the positionof having made false statements. No one could havebeen more surprised at these utterances than ourselves anda number of the brethren of the Twelve, because it wasunderstood that care would be exercised upon thesepoints.We have just received a letter, signed by your-self, Bros. Penrose & Richards, in relation to getting delegatesto the National Convention. The suggestions which youmake about Hadley D. Johnson have been considered;but it would be impracticable, it is thought, to usehim. We are taking other steps to see if we caneffect something in the direction which you mention.We think it very important that this matter shouldbe attended to, and that no pains should be sparedto prevent the insertion into the Democratic Platformof anything reflecting upon us. 
 he attributed his lack of explanations concerning fundsand other matters. He freely acknowledged that he hadnot done right, and that he could not blame us, underthe circumstances.Just before we parted he mentionedthat he had in contemplation the organization of a National Bank in Utah. He said that he had had conversation with the Comptroller and had endeavoredto get the privilege of calling it the National Bank ofthe State of Utah; but that for political reasons thishad been deemed unwise. He said that he had muchto say on this subject; but as we had not time tolisten, it was deferred. He intimated, however, thatthe little bank and his bank might work in har-mony and control affairs. Of course, we had verylittle to say upon this subject, as we did not knowenough about his plans to answer except in a generalway. We feel as you do, that all his transactionshere should be explained, and we shall do what we

 Dear Parents, I hope you nor none of my friends will think me assuming while addressing you upon spiritual Subjects I have but one motive in view & that to clean my garments of all whether they be ParentsBrethren Sisters Neighbours Priest or People Kings or rullers whareevermy My Master calls. My motive is ^to^ act for the best good of all myfellowmen. But O how changed the scene a few months since my mind was flushed with the idea of accumilateing something of this worlds goods that I might enjoy the society of my Parents in their decline oflife with other friends not knowing because the prophets were dead &the fathers fallen asleep but what all things would continue as they werefrom the beginning. But now the scene is changed while I am calledto forsake Parents Brethren Sisters houses lands to go fourth as a lamb among wolfs, to assist in pruning the vineyard for the last time yeato Jews as well as gentile to visit foreign climes & the Islands of Sea to endure the perils of chains, vaults, dungeons, scourgings, &every epithet than^t^ an indignant wicked generation can heapupon my head for the testimony of Jesus Christ which is the spirit of prophecy. With these Eternal truths resting upon my mindI say unto you my Dear friends in the name of Jesus Christ &by the authority of the Priesthood confered upon me that I do not war at uncertainty I do not fight as those that beat the air I know in whohm whom I trust. I was not called by man nor by the will of a man by^u^t by the revelation of Jesus Christ therefore I intreatyou to receieve my testimony when I say to one & all of my friends to whom my pen or voice may reach to repent & be Baptized for theremishion of your sins that you may receieve the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands of those who are ordained unto that power for this promise is unto you & unto your Children & to all that are afar off even as many as the Lord our God shall call. I say again the cause of Latter Day Saints is not fals, is not quakerisms, Catholicism, or secret it is openly manifest before the world as much as the Church was in the days of Jesus Christ. The Book of Mormon is the word of God it is true it is a precious treasure, itis the record of the tribe of Joseph it is the stick of Joseph in the hands of Ephraimwe hold it as sacred as we do the Bible & no more so for Testimony see ##Genesis 49:22-27|Gen 49ch 22: to 27## ##Deuteronomy 33:13-18|Deut 33ch 13 to 18##, ##Psalms 85:11-12|Psalms 85ch 11:12## ##Revelations 14:6|Rev 14ch6##, ##Isaiah 29:8-24|Isaiah 29ch 8 to 24##: ##Ezekiel 37:16-28|Ezekiel 37ch16 to 28## ##Genesis 48:16|Gen 48ch 16##; ##1 Chronicles 5:1-2|1st Chron 5ch 1:2## ##Jeremiah 31:9|Jer 31ch 9##, ##Hosea 8:12|Hosea 8ch 12##, ##John 10:16|St John 10ch 16##. Now I say is not Ephraim a multitude of nations in the midst of the Earth upon this continent were not the tribe of Joseph sheep as much as much as the tribe of Judah atAsia is not the Book of Mormon the record of the tribe of Joseph as muchas the Bible of the tribe of Judah it certainly is All the meek & honestof the Earth that will read the Book of Mormon without prejudice & askGod in the name of Jesus Christ for his spirit & light & truth & are willingto obey His commands to such I say they will have the Spirit of God to lead them into the light of the Book of Mormon they will receieve it & believe it is true as their is a God in Israel

 AN EPISTLE OF THE TWELVE,TO THE BTETHREN SCATTERED ABROAD ON THE CONTINENTOF AMERICA, GREETING:BELOVED BRETHREN,It seemeth good to us to write unto you at this time concerning the great things of the kingdom of our God, and more especially as we have been called upon by the late General Conference so to do; that the work may not be hindered, but that all may understand their privilege and duty in this day of glorious events, so that by exercising themselves therein, they may attain unto those blessings which God has in store for his people inthe last days.We have abundant occasion, and we rejoice exceed-ingly at the privilege we have had of beholding so many thousands of our brethren and sisters as were assembledat the late conference, and for the most perfect harmony and good feeling that prevailed throughout all their deliberations; for the great amount of valuable instruc-tions by President Joseph Smith and others; and for the disposition which we have seen manifested by all who were present to carry into effect all those noble plans and principles which were derived from heaven, and have been handed down to earth, to carry forward thegreat and glorious work which is already commenced,and which must be consummated to secure the salvationof Israel.While the minutes of the General Conference are be-fore you, which will be read with interest by every lo-ver of Zion, we shall recapitulate some items, and detail more particularly to the understanding of those whohad not the privilege of being present on that interest-ing occasion, the past, present and future situation and prospects of the church, and the stakes, and those thingswhich immediately concern their best interests.A short time since and the saints were fleeing before their enemies. Whips, imprisonments, tortures anddeath stared them in the face, and they were compelled to seek an asylum in a land of strangers. They soughtthey found it within the peaceful bosom of Illinois; a State whose citizens are inspired with a love of liberty;whose souls are endued with those noble principles ofcharity and benevolence which ever bid the stranger welcome and minister to his wants: in this State, whose soil is vieing with its citizens in all that is good andlovely, the saints have found a resting place, where, freed from tyranny and mobs, they are beginning to real-ize the fulfilment of the ancient prophets, "they shall build houses and inhabit them, plant vineyards and eat the fruit thereof, having none to molest or make afraid."In this city the church has succeeded in securing sev-eral extensive plots of land, which have been laid out incity lots, a part of which have been sold, a part has been distributed to the widows and orphan, and a partremains for sale. These lots are for the inheritance ofthe saints, a resting place for the church, a habitation forthe God of Jacob; for here he has commanded a houseto be built unto his name where he may manifest himselfunto his people as in former times, when he caused the ark, the tabernacle, and the temple to be reared, and thecloud and the fire to rest down thereon; and not that thetemple be built only, but that it be completed quickly, and that no more general conference be held, till it shall be held therein; and that the Nauvoo House be finished for the accommodation of the brethren from afar, and the stranger who shall come up hither to inquire after the workof the Lord and worship in his Temple.Scores of brethren in this city, have offered to boardone and two labourers each till the Temple is completed;many have volunteered to labour continually, and thebrethren generally are giving one-tenth part of their time, or one-tenth part of their income, according to cir-cumstances; while those sisters, who can do nothingmore, are knitting socks and mittens, and preparing gar-ments for the laborers, so that they may be made as com-fortable as possible during the coming winter. In viewof these things we would invite our brethren for many miles distant around us, to send in their teams for draw-ing stone, lumber, and materials for the buildings; andat the same time load their wagons with all kinds of grainand meat, provision and clothing, and hay and provender in abundance, that the laborer faint not, and the teams bemade strong; also that journey men stone cutters, &c.come, bringing their tools with them, and enlist in theglorious enterprise.Most of the plats in this city before referred to, as wellas several farms and large lots of land in this and the ad-joining counties are paid for. and are secured to thechurch by good and sufficient titles; while the townplat for the town of Warren near Warsaw, is secured on such conditions that the brethren can be accommodated with lots on very reasonable terms; but the large platin Nauvoo, purchased by Messrs. Hotchkiss, Tuttle & Co.of New Haven, Conn., remains unpaid for, and the timehas now arrived, when it is very desirable on the part ofthe church, as well as on the part of the gentlemen ofwhom it was purchased, that payment should be madeand a warrantee title secured; to accomplish which wehave been called upon by the united voice of the Gene-ral Conference to address the churches in the easternstates, to advise with the brethren in those regions, anddevise ways and means whereby this debt may be liqui-dated, Hotchkiss & Co. satisfied, the plat secured to thechurch, and the brethern in the east at the same timetransfer their real estate from the place where it now is,to this city or region of country, according to their de-sire.The contract for the "Hotchkiss purchase" in Nauvoo,consisting of upwards of five hundred acres, was enteredinto, on, or about the 9th of August. 1839, for the specifiedsum of fifty three thousand five hundred dollars, and se-curity was given to Messrs. R. H. Hotchkiss, Smith Tut-tle, and John Gillet, for the amount of the same in twonotes of equal amount, one payable in ten years, and theother in twenty years from the date thereof, signed byMessrs. Hyrum Smith, Joseph Smith, and Sidney Rigdon.In August last, interest to the amount of six thousanddollars or upwards, had accumulated on sailnotes whichit has not been in the power of the church to pay up tothe present time. The nature of this purchase, and thesituation of the church is such, that it is necessary thatthe notes should be taken up, the interest stopped, and a warrantee title secured immediately; and a correspon-dence is now in progress with Messrs. Hotchkiss & Co.to effect this thing, and bring forward a final settlement.But, say you, what can we do to accomplish this greatand desirable object? Let the brethren in the easternstates, who have lands which they wish to dispose of, sothat they may remove hither and secure to themselvesan inheritance among the saints, either in the cities orfarms in the vicinity, and are willing to have their landsin the east made over to Messrs. Hotchkiss & Co. towardsthe payment of the foregoing notes, communicate withus immediately, at this place,stating to us the extent and value of their property. Then as soon as we shall havereceived communications concerning property sufficientto cancel the obligations, and the necessary prelimina-ries are understood with Messrs.Hotchkiss & Co. we willdispatch an agent to New Haven, to complete the nego-ciation, transfer your property, take up the notes, andsecure a deed; and those whose property is thus trans-ferred can have the value thereof here, in city lots, orlands in the vicinity; and thus your property will prove to you as good as money, inasmuch as you desire to emi-grate, and you will no longer be obliged to tarry afar off,because that money is so scarce you cannot sell and getyour pay. If there are those among you to whom Godhas given in abundance, and they desire to appropriatesome portion thereof for the beenfit of his people, for theredemption of Zion; for a blessing to the widows of those who have been slain for the word of God, and been bu-ried in a well, for a sustenance for their fatherless children, and provide for them a habitation, they cannot doit more effectually than by devoting a portion of theirsustenance towards liquidating this claim.To those brethren who live so far distant that theycannot send in their loaded teams,and yet desire to assist in building the Lord's house, we would say, gather yourselves together and bring of your substance, yoursilver, and gold, and apparel, and of your superabundancecast into the treasury of the Lord and see if he will notpour you out a blessing till there is not room enough to ceive it.Brethren, the blessings of the kingdom are for you, for the body of Christ, for all the members, and God will help those who help themselves, and bless those who will bless each other, and do as they would be done unto. The gold and the silver is the Lords; all the trea-sures of the earth, the flocks and the herds of the fieldsand the cattle of the thousand hills are his; if he were hungry would he crave thy food, or thirsty would he ask thy drink? Nay: he would only ask that which washis own, he would feast on his own flocks, and quench his thirst at his own springs. This God is the God of the saints; he is your God, and he has made you stewardsof all that has been committed to you, and will require his own with usury; and will you not be faithful in a little that you may be made rulers over many cities? Yes, you will, we know you will.The journeyings and gatherings, and buildings of thesaints are nothing new, and as they are expecting, looking, and praying for the completion of the dispensation of the fullness of times, they must also expect that their progress will be onward or they will be of no avail, for what is not of faith is sin, and can you believe that God will hear your prayers, and bring you on your journey, gather you, and build your houses, and you not put forth one hand or make one exertion to help yourselves? No;therefore inasmuch as the saints believe that father Abraham journeyed to a distant land, at the command ofthe Highest, where himself and household (whose house-hold we are, if we keep the commandments) might en-joy the fruits of their labors unmolested, and worship the God of heaven according to the dictates of their ownconscience and his law. That his seed afterwards gath-ered to Canaan, the Land of Promise; that David was commanded to build a house, where the son of man might have a place to lay his head, and the disciples be endued with power from on high, and were with one ac-cord in one place; they must also believe that this dis-pensation comprehends all the great works of all former dispensations; and that the children must gather as did the fathers; must build a house, where they may be en-dued, and be found together worshipping and doing as their fathers did, when Jehovah spake and the angels of heaven ministered unto them; and if these things are not in this generation, then we have not arrived at thedispensation of the fullness of times as we anticipate,and our faith and prayers are vain.Is it possible that we labour in vain, and toil for nought, and that we shall be disappointed at the last? No, we know assuredly that the set time to favor Zion has comeand her sons and daughters shall rejoice in her glory. The time has come when the great Jehovah would have a resting place on earth, a habitation for his chosen, where his law shall be revealed, and his servants be enduedfrom on high, to bring together the honest in heart from the four winds; where the saints may enter the baptis-mal font for their dead relations, so that they may bejudged according to men in the flesh, and live accordingto God in the spirit, and come forth in the celestial king-dom; a place over which the heavenly messengersmay watch and trouble the waters as in days of old, so that when the sick are put therein they shall be made whole; a place where all the ordinances shall be made manifest and the saints shall unite in the songs of Zion, even praise, thanksgiving, and hallelujahs to God and the Lamb, that he has wrought out their deliverance, andbound Satan fast in chains.What then shall we do? Let us all arise, and with oneunited mighty exertion, by the strength of Israel's God, oppose the powers of darkness, and every being and principle that may rise up against us, and complete the work already commenced. Let us not for a moment lend an ear to evil and designing men who would sub-vert the truth, and blacken the character of the servant of The Most High God, by publishing abroad that the pro-phet is enriching himself on the spoils of the brethren. When brother Joseph stated to the general conferencethe amount and situation of the property of the church,of which he is trustee in trust by the united voice of thechurch, he also stated the amount of his own possessionson earth; and what do you think it was? We will tell you. His old horse Charley, given him in Kirtland; twopet deer; two old turkeys, and four young ones; the old cow given him by a brother in Missouri, his old Ma-jor, dog; his wife, children, and a little household furni-ture; and this is the amount of the great possessions of thatman whom God has called to lead his people in these lastdays; this the sum total of the great estates, the splendid mansions and noble living of him who has spent a life of toil and suffering, of privation and hardships, of impris-onments and chains, of dungeons and vexations suits, and every kind of contumely, and contempts ungodlymen could heap upon him, and last of all report him as rolling in wealth and luxury which he had plundered from the spoils of those for whose good he had thus toil-ed and suffered. Who would be willing to suffer whathe has suffered, and labour near twenty years as he hasdone, for the wealth he is in possession of?Brethren, in view of all these things let us be up and doing. Let those in the eastern States use all diligencein communicating to us their ability to assist in theHotchkiss payment, being assured that no exertion theycan make, will equal what has already been made foryou and the church generally;and let all the saints comeup to the places of gathering, and with their mites andtheir abundance, as God has given them in trust, help to build up the old waste places, which have been throwndown for many generations, knowing, that when they are completed, they will belong unto the people of the Most High God, even the meek, the honest in heart, heshall possess all things in the due time of the Lord. Benot covetous, but deal in righteousness, for what thesaints shall not possess by purchase and in righteous-ness they shall not possess, for no unrighteous thing can enter into the kingdom; therefore, beloved breth-ren, deal justly, love mercy, walk humbly before God,and whatever your hands find to do, do it with your might, keeping all the commandments, and then, whether in life or in death, all things will be yours, whether theybe temples or lands, houses or vineyards, baptisms or enduements, revelations or healings, all things will beyours, for you will be Christ's and Christ is God's.BRIGHAM YOUNG,HEBER C. KIMBALL,ORSON PRATT,LYMAN WIGHT,JOHN TAYLOR,WILFORD WOODRUFF,GEO. A. SMITH,WILLARD RICHARDS.Nauvoo, Oct. 12th, 1841. 
 To the Bishops and Members of the Church of Jesus Christof Latter-day Saints, Residing in the various Settlementsthroughout these Mountains:BELOVED BRETHREN AND SISTERS:The Temple at St. George, Washington County, Utah Territory, rapidly approachescompletion. Already some portions of it are in a condition to be used, and in a few weeks weexpect to be administering ordinances therein for the living and the dead. The General Con-ference of the Church was adjourned on the 8th instant to hold its next session at 10 A.M.on the 6th of April in the Temple at St. George. We hope the entire building will be com-pleted by that time and that we shall be able to dedicate it to the Lord, our God. In the daysof our poverty, and while we had no Temple in which to administer ordinances for the deadand to give endowments and to perform sealings and other ordinances for the living, the Lordpermitted us to erect an Endowment House in this city. This we have used for many years,and many ordinances have been administered therein; but there are other important ordi-nances which have not been, and cannot be, administered, except in a Temple built and dedi-cated to the Most High for that purpose. Such a Temple we now have so far completed at St.George that we can commence attending to these ordinances there. The mind of the Spirit tous has been that we should, for the present at least, discontinue in the Endowment House inthis city the work of baptisms for the dead, of giving endowments and of sealing, and that,hereafter, these ordinances should be performed in the Temple, or the Temples that shall bebuilt. This announcement we have made to the Saints. They have been profoundly movedthereat. They are aroused to action. They now begin to appreciate how precious are the opportunities they have had. Never before has there been such an anxiety displayed for theprivileges of the Endowment House. The prospect of it being closed causes the people to thinkof their baptisms, endowments and sealings. They now perceive, as probably they never didbefore, how convenient it would be to have a Temple completed in this part of the Territory.This would save them the lengthy journey to and from St. George. The want of Temples atother convenient points to which the Saints can repair to receive their ordinances will now befelt at other places besides Salt Lake City. Especially will this be the case where persons wishto marry. The Lord has taught us how important it is that our marriages should be solem-nized according to the laws He has given, in holy places, where wives can be joined to hus-bands for time and all eternity. What Latter-day Saint can be satisfied with any marriageor authority less than this? Which of them, if he understands the laws of God, can feelindifferent as to whether his wife shall be his for eternity or for time only; or whether hischildren shall be born in the covenant and be legal heirs to the priesthood or have to becomesuch by adoption? It is for these and other ordinances that we are commanded of the Lordto build Temples. We are now abundantly able to build them, and in them should the ordi-nances be administered which have been acceptable only in the days of our poverty in otherplaces. At an holy altar in the Temple of the Lord can ordinances be administered to thosewho are deemed worthy which they cannot receive elsewhere.We feel led to say to the Latter-day Saints throughout these mountains: Let usarise and build Temples unto our God at such places as He shall designate, into which weand our children can enter and receive those blessings that He has in store for us. Let theBishops of the settlements in Washington, Kane, Iron, Pi-ute, Beaver, Millard, Sevier, San-pete and Juab Counties call the people of their Wards together and ascertain from them howmuch each one is willing to subscribe in labor and means, monthly, quarterly, or annual-ly, towards the erection of a Temple at Manti, Sanpete County. Let the Bishops of the Wards in Utah, Wasatch, Summit, Salt Lake, Tooele, Davis, Morgan, and Weber Counties callthe people of their Wards together and ascertain from them how much each one will donatein labor and means, monthly, quarterly, or annually, towards the completion of the Temple inthis city. Let the Bishops of the various Wards in Box Elder, Cache and Rich Counties inUtah Territory, and in the Counties of Bear Lake and Oneida in Idaho Territory, call publicmeetings and learn from the people what each one is willing to do, monthly, quarterly or an-nually, towards the erection of a Temple at Logan, Cache County. And at these meetingsthe amount each person shall subscribe should be placed opposite his or her name, so thatwhat can be depended upon may be known in writing. Each Bishop can then make a state-ment over his own signature to the President's Office of the amount of labor and means thathis Ward will furnish in the aggregate and that he will be responsible for.

 In proposing the erection of new Temples, it is not expected that the worknow being done upon the Temple in this city by individuals and by the various quorums shallcease. The labor upon the Temple here will continue to be pushed forward by those now en-gaged in it until sites are selected for, and work shall be commenced by the different quorumsupon, other Temples. These Temples which we now propose to build will not be costly struc-tures. They will be for Endowment purposes, and can be easily and quickly erected by thepeople from whom the labor is required. You will perceive, by the anxiety of the Saints toavail themselves of the privileges of the Endowment House in this city, and the manner inwhich they are now crowding here, how necessary and desirable it is that these buildingsshould be speedily completed, so that the facilities for sealing and the administration of otherordinances should be placed within the reach of all who are worthy of them without their be-ing compelled to travel to and from St. George to the Temple there. When the Saints wererequired to build the Temple at Kirtland, Ohio, they were few in number and poor in means;at Nauvoo also, when the Temple was erected there the Saints were not numerous, and theircircumstances, as contrasted with ours in these valleys, were those of great poverty. But inrearing those Temples the people were greatly blessed. The Lord increased their substance,provided ways of deliverance from their enemies, and bestowed gifts and knowledge upon themwhich are beyond all earthly price. So it will be now, if we will arise in the majesty andstrength of our calling as the people of God, and build these Temples with willing hearts and liberal hands, the Lord will pour out His blessings upon us to an extent we have never here-tofore known. Our children will multiply and increase in faith, and though Satan mayrage, as he and his servants always do when the work of building Temples is being urgedforward, yet we will prosper and grow stronger and stronger until the redemption of Zionshall be fully accomplished. Peace be with you, and Lord bless you.Salt Lake City, U. T.,25th October, 1876.BRIGHAM YOUNG, JOHN W. YOUNG,DANIEL H.

 [sideways text] Rec'd May 18, 1888ans'd [May] 21 —[1888]— [end of sideways text]PRESIDENT'S OFFICE,Salt Lake City, Utah, May 11, 1888.President Joseph F. Smith,Washington, D. C.Dear Brother Joseph F.:We have just sent you a dispatch concerning BrotherFranklin S. Richards. His help is needed here very much. We did not, however, wish to ask him to return without consulting you, and shall be governed by your answer. It ap-pears probable that every piece of property that the Receiver can by any possibility es-tablish a shadow of claim for will be seized by him. Besides the gas and the street rail-road stock, suit is entered for the part of the Tithing Office block sold by the WeberStake Association. Suits have also been entered for the house occupied by Brother L. W.Shurtliff, and the Tabernacle square. There is a note given by Brother Shurtliff in fa-vor of Richard J. Taylor, upon which there is still $2000.00 due, with interest. Thiswill doubtless be seized by the Receiver if he can get possession of it. We are informedthat he intends to attack the Daniel H. Wells lot, no doubt with the design to claimthat, and also the Council House corner and the old Constitution lot, and perhaps theMuseum. Parley L. Williams is familiar with our business through his former connectionwith Le Grand Young and his general intimacy with our real estate transactions. The pieceof land sold by Alfales Young, which stands in Angus M. Cannon's name, has already beensued for. Where this will end it is difficult to say; but we feel the need of more ef-ficient help here. We are not strong in legal help, and our defence seems very feeble 
 considering the magnitude of the interest involved.We have just received Alopeke's proposition which yousent to us. We have it under consideration. It seems like a long time, however, to wait untilafter the election before he enters heartily into the work. We shall advise you as toour conclusions as quickly as possible.As you will see by the papers, it has been decided todedicate the Manti Temple on the 21st. inst. We do not expect there will be so large agathering there as there was at Logan, because of the difficulty in reaching there,there being 15 miles of travel after leaving the terminus of the railway. There willdoubtless be a heavy turnout from the Seveir and Sanpete Stakes and other parts of the Temple District. We ^, the council,^ have decided to place the Temple in charge of Brother Daniel H. Wells,and, if there shall be no objection, Brother Anton H. Lund will be his assistant. Wethink that Brother Wells can attend to this with good assistance, and that he will enjoyhis labors. Of course, his health is not in a condition to admit of his doing very muchlabor; but his past familiarity with temple ordinances will enable him to render effic-ient service in directing affairs.The "boom" does not excite the attention that it didawhile ago. In fact, we suppose it is dying out. Still a great many n^a^ncicipate a revivalwhen the summer fairly opens and we have an influx of visitors. Up to the present, how-ever, it has been considerable of a bubble, though some have realized large prices forsales they have made.Brother Erastus Snow has been very low, and for a time 
 his life was despaired of; in fact, it was freely said by the doctors that he would not leave his room again alivi^e^. Those who administered to him, however, had a different faith;still his condition remained very critical. Brothers Heber John Richards and Seymour B.Young and a gentile doctor had tried to draw his water from him and had given it up orconcluded that there was none to draw. Afterwards Drs. Anderson and Benedict made him avisit, and Dr. Benedict succeeded in drawing upwards of half a gallon from him, whichrelieved him immensely, and under his skilful treatment Brother Snow has continued toimprove, and the prospect is that he may live for many years yet.Of course, you will see by the papers the result ofthe attempt of our brethren to affiliate with the Democratic party. Such treatment is not very encouraging to our people. There are a great many worthless people connected with the party, and in Ogden we are told that the Republican element is far superior tothe Democratic in respectability.The weather at the present time is very pleasant. Thehealth of the people is good. We constantly remember you in our prayers and take deepinterest in all that you write to us. With love to yourself, to Brothes Richards, Pen-rose, Caine, Campbell and Gibbs,We remain,Your Brethren,Wilford WoodruffGeo. Q. Cannon[sideways text] Committee [end of sideways text]

C.Dear Brother Joseph F.:Your esteemed favor of the 12th. inst. we receivedupon our return from Manti, whither we went on the evening of the 13th. by specialtrain to Nephi and from Nephi by carriage to Manti. Our purpose in going to Mantiwas to hold a private dedication of the Temple on the 17th. We reached there on Tues-day morning about four o'clock, and were occupied in attending to business, makingpreparations and in meetings until Thursday, when we met at ten o'clock and had aprayer circle, and at twelve I -[President Woodruff]- read the dedication prayer, therebeing twenty-nine persons present, including all the Apostles in the Territory except-ing Brothers Erastus Snow, Moses Thatcher and John W. Taylor. We had a very delightfulseason, and everyone enjoyed himself exceedingly. We remained there until Friday atnoon and then returned, leaving the brethren who could appear above ground to attendto the public dedication. The Temple is beautifully finished and reflects great cred-it upon all engaged in the labor of constructing it, and also those who furnished themeans. It is a cause of unbounded joy to think that the privilege has been granted tous of completing another structure like this, in which the servants of God can enterto attend to the ordinances for the living and the dead.

 OFFICE OFThe First Presidencyof theChurch of Jesus ChristofLatter-day Saints.P. O. Box B.Salt Lake City, Utah, June 25, 1897.Presidency and High Councilof the Salt Lake Stake of Zion.Dear Brethren:It having been brought informally to the attention of theFirst Presidency that a paper had been prepared by the High Council ofthe Salt Lake Stake which Bros. George C. Lambert, B. M. Harmon and Geo.M. Spencer were required to sign, and which paper Bro. Lambert, at least, objected to sign for the reason that it would stultify him, itwas deemed prudent under the circumstances by the First Presidency to getthose of the Apostles who were convenient to join them in listening toa printed document which had been circulated among the stockholders ofthe South Jordan Canal Company by the three brethren above named; and tolisten to a paper which had been prepared by the High Council for thesethree brethren to sign. Accordingly the First Presidency and PresidentLorenzo Snow, F. D. Richards and John Henry Smith, of the Twelve Apostlesmet at President Woodruff's Office on Monday, June 21st, and listenedpatiently to the reading of these two documents. Before doing so, however, there were verbal statements made to them concerning both sides of the question involved so as to throw light upon the positionof affairs and the causes which led to the publication of this report byan auditing committee consisting of the three brethren above named. Itappears from the printed document itself that this report which theymade was rejected at a meeting held for the purpose of hearing it, by 
 been appointed by the Council to preside, with Brother Anton H. Lund as his assistant,and Brother M. F. Farnsworth as Recorder. Brothers J. D. T. McAllister, D. D. McArthur andJames G. Bleak came up from St. George to attend the dedication, and they will remainto assist for a short time until everything is got into working order. The Templewill pe opened for ordinances on the 28th. of May.In my other letter to-day I expressed my feelings con-cerning the return of Brother Richards and your visit to St. Louis to attend the Con-vention. I need not therefore repeat in this letter respecting that matter. WhetherBrother John W. Young will attend or not we do not know. He would like to be appointed to go there, but we have not said anything to him upon the subject. If he should go,it will be because he desires to himself.Upon receiving your dispatch for the umi tausani wetelegraphed you that elima tausani had been given to C. for the same purpose withelima haneri for his private use. We thought it better to send you this informationthat you might be fully aware of what was being done and be able to represent thesame to No. 3. We think you did well in putting the responsibilitu^y^ on them.We hope that we shall get a good Chief Justice. Wehave heard of Roger Sherman before. The Bowers concerning whom you write, me think, must be Powers, who, we hear, is being favored by Don Dickinson. We sincerely trustthat he will never obtain another appointment to the bench or any other office inour Territory; for he is a most dangerous man because of his want of principle. 
 Brother George Teasdale has been terribly exercisedover emigration matters, and his letters are full of descriptions of the anguishwhich he has suffered in consequence of the attempt to change the route. He seems tothink that our attempt on this side to do business is a reflection on him, and thatwe have not that confidence in him that we have had in others at the same place. Ihope you will write fully to him on this subject and keep him thoroughly advised, as a good deal of the feeling that he has is due, we think, to misapprehension.The health of Brother Erastur^s^ Snow is very precarious.We visited him last night and administered to him; but the description that we gotfrom his wives of his condition and urine is really alarming. However, we exercise allthe faith we can, and shall struggle for him to be spared to us. The presence and la-bors of such men are of exceeding value to us.It seems that the Receiver is determined to get pos-session of everything that ever belonged to the Church, and they are pursuing theirwork with great vigor and an apparent determination to strip us of all they can.We are having delightful weather at the present time,and the health of the people generally is good. With love and praying the Lord tobless you and preserve you from the hands of your enemies,We remain, Your Brethren,Wilford WoodruffGeo. Q. Cannon[sideways text] Committee [end of sideways text] 
 the stockholders present and others who held proxies of the absentstockholders. One of the views taken by the First Presidency and Apostles was that the High Council in taking up this case had perhapstranscended the bounds assigned it, as this was a case in which legalquestions were involved, the Canal Company being an incorporated company; but this suggestion did not preevent the First Presidency and Apostlesfrom listiening to the documents. After hearing them and exchanging views it was deeply regretted by all present that this rejected reportof the auditing committee ghad been put into print and circulated. Nothingappeared before us, however, to invaldiate the truth of the report, especially in view of the statement made: that those who were accused of handling the funds improperly had since made arrangements for strainght-ening out the accounts complained of by the committee; neithder did any-thing appear before us as a reason why this report had been rejected bythe stockholders' meeting above referred to. It is reasonable tosuppose that as nothing appears making the correctness of the printedreport at all questioenable, the committee which made it based it uponthe fullest information at their command. Nothing appears, from allthat is known, that this report was a false report; and while we regret its publication, ^because^ we think the stockholders might have been informed of all the facts without putting them into print; but, while expressing ourselves to this effect concerning the publication of this report, wedo not feel that the committee should be required to sign the paper thathas been prepared by the High Council for their signature. We wouldourselves shrink from signing such a paper under the circumstances; for while it may be a fact that the reputation of some of the officers ofthe canal company has been damaged by the printing of this report;on the other hand, in correcting that wrong, if it be viewed as a wrong, in the way proposed, we do not think it wise to create another

 wrong and injure the character of the committee by requiring them tosign the paper that has been prepared. We think this would be injuriousto them, and two wrongs never did make a right.Our view, therefore, is that this matter should be arrangedso as to correct whatever evil may have been done by the circulation ofthis printed document, and at the same time not injure the men whoaudited the books and who made the report from the books as they foundthem. In making this statement we do so on the presumption that the report of this auditing committee was a truthful report according to thebest information within their reach.Respectfully, your Brethren,Wilford WoodruffGeo.

 VISIT MY WIFE'S FOLKS—GO FISHING IN THE SEA. 29hold another meeting; but I felt anxious to continue my journey, and on the 20th of July I parted with my father, step-mother and sister, and took stage for Hartford with my wife.On my arrival at Hartford, not having money to pay the fare of both of us, I paid my wife's fare to Rowley, Mass., where there was a branch of the Church, presided over by Brother Nathaniel Holmes, father of Jonathan and Milton Holmes, and I journeyed on foot.I spent eight days at New Rowley, holding meetings and visiting the Saints, including the Holmes family, and left there on the 1st of August.On the 8th of August, in company with my wife and Elder Hale, I visited my wife's father, Ezra Carter, and his familyin Scarboro, Maine, it being the first time I had ever seen any of her relatives. We were very kindly received. My wife had been absent from her father's home about one year.I spent eight days with Father Carter and household, and one day I went out to sea with Fabian and Ezra Carter, my brothers-in-law, in a boat, to fish with hooks. We caught250 cod, haddock and hake, and we saw four whales, two at a time, it being the first time in my life I had ever seen thekind of a fish which is said to have swallowed Jonah.On the 18th of August, 1837, I parted with my wife and herfather's household, leaving her with them, and, in company with Jonathan H. Hale, started upon the mission that I had inview when I left Kirtland.We walked ten miles to Portland, and took passage on thesteamboat Bangor, which carried us to Owl's Head, where we went on board of a sloop which landed us on North Fox Islandat 2 o'clock, a. m., on the 20th. 
 Kirtland Sunday 9th Sept, 1838Mr. Woodruff[illegible]Yours of Aug. 3rd hasbeen Recd & I now proceed to answer it which I should have cheerfully donesome two weeks earlyer than this, had not our intelligence from Mo. concerning Mormon matters been of suchan interesting nature, that I thoughtit worth while to delay, in hopes that something of a decisive character mightbe obtained respecting the great excitement that prevails in upper Mo. on accountof some recent measures that have beentaken in that vicinity not only amongthe Mormons, but among the citizens also.We have been authentically informed byinformation from various sources that there has been a fight in Davis Co. Mo. between the citizens & Saints & that thelatter were the first aggressors, thatit was at a ^state^ Election, held on the 6th Aug. that none were killed but a number werewounded, -- that J. Smith Jr. & someother leading men, followed by about120 desiples well armed surrounded thehouse of a Magistrate & compelled himon paine of death to sign a writing the [[purport of which he did not know neither have we as yet been able to asertain; that about 500 Mormons wereorganized & well armed, who were goingthrough the county to force every manto sign said writing. That Smith isteaching them, that Mohammed sust- ained & propogtated his religion by the sword& that he can his, that Mohammed was a true prophet &c. 
 Manchester Jany 28, 1840Beloved bro Richards,I recieved yours of the 25th on Sunday togetherwith one from sister Clayton. I am informed that my family is tolerablywell for which I roejoice.I had intended to answer your letter yesterday but I concluded to wait.I thank you for the council contained in your last.Have not said any thing to the council concerning bro Arthurs case, but I thinkI shall have to do it yet. He seems to grow worse, last night bro Green proposedat his meeting a subs-cription to be entered into for Sarhah Duckwortah, a few shillingswas collected. at the close of the meeting arthur stepped forward and said he wouldhave nothing to do with it. The box he said was put in the room for thosethings and if they would break the order &c. they might take it into their own handsI thought it best not to notice him then, & went out to supper. when I returned againI found him railing amongst them &c. I told him that was not the place to complainof such things, we would hear it at the council friday eve &c. he shewed a very badspirit—he is not one with us, but I want to be just & merciful. If you haveany thing more on this subject it will be thankfully recieved before the councilHave not yet took his licence.Feel sorry to learn that there is something unpleasant at [P] again.To your questions, I give council at your request according to the measure of thespirit & wisdom which God hath given me—If I err, Tis but me.To the first— "If a sister letts evil reports &c" & having been visited according to orderby Elders yet will give no satisfaction either to them or the church" I feel to sayI dont see how those Elders can be justified in not bringing the case before thecouncil at least. I should say if they would not, they will be guilty of unfaithfulness &c2nd The partys desiring the case to be put off—2 or more wks—when a case of transgressionis clearly proved against them. They ought to be suspended from fellowship—untill satisfaction is made to the church.3rd I should say it is not the privilege of any member who is known to be undertransgression to partake of the sacrement untill satisfaction is made. And if anofficer administers sacrement to such knowing the case &c. ought he himself not to [be]brought before the council.4—If my wife was under transgression &c. I dare not plead her off—no more than any other member 
 such would be the council I should give, from the idea I have of the statement.You desire to hear something about Burslem & I am happy to say I received aletter on friday—the substance of which I will lay before you."We had a cold windy ride and got to B about 1/2 p[as]t 9 [oweighs] was conducted to ElderCordons by a sister—was much pleased with my interview with the Saints—findbro Cordon very faithful & all the official members so far as I know.They have baptised 22 sinse W. C left on the 23 December. Total baptised in the potteries66. Total confirmed 58. last week, (2 wk to night) their opposers flung the candlesand candlesticks at their heads but notwithstanding one came to be baptisedBro Alfred baptised a Gentleman & Lady—on sunday morning and their servanta few days before. They keep a provision wharehouse in Hanley. We are againtrying to get a door opened at Hanley. Do not know how much more warning thepeople will have in the potteries, neither do I know how long I shall tarry here. I feelas though the spirit will soon send one of us to Birmingham, can tell better in afew days. Love &c—Elder Turley—love—had quite a sore throat the day aftertheir arrival. Yours &c. Willford WoodruffThis A.M. have recieved a letter from bro Taylor—tis quite a lengthy epistle—commences with love & blessing, after refers to the state in which he finds things inEngland, he refers to the sufferings of the Saints in America. Then states thuson Sunday morning they went to Aitkins Chapel & after the preaching bro Taylorasked permission to speak a little—they answered he had better speak to the leadersin the vestry. After meeting they retired into the vestry—They asked what sect hebelonged to &c. He then gave his testimony &c in plain mild language & askedpermission to preach in their chapel &c. They told him they has not authorityto permit him &c. Many seemed affected. He stated they would hold a meetinglast [eve] in [owe] of Aitkins preachers hereses. I suppose they have wrote youI have also got 2 letters from Bedford. bro Lavender writes as follows"B. Jany 25—D[ea]r brethren, my soul is grieved very much from what I hear about JamesLea. Mr Rawlins has given me a letter written by a gentleman at Liecesterwho appears to have been a friend to Lea it reads as following. Sir I have read overa little of Lea's proceedings. he left Leicester with not less than from 30 to 40 soveriens of yourmoney. when he went to pay Simpson his last rent he declared he saw as much as Ihave stated. Limpson [Simpson] said while Lea was ill he pleaded so much poverty & distress thathe thought he had not one halfpenny to help himself. So I sent him several dinnersand a bottle of wine thinking it was a deed of charity. Simpson said Lea on oneoccasion when taking his purse from his pocket, took out a handful of sovereinsto the amount stated and said, Simpson I have a great many enemies in this placeand I will leave it this day and I do not care a dam not a buggars for its varyname of the lot for I have plenty of money to carry me out of Leicester. Yours &cI find D[ea]r brethren this is a task for me. Lea was a servant to Mr Rawlins 
 also that "one can chase a 1000 & two [[illegible 10,000 to flight" & that in case of necessity God will send down legionsof angels to their assistance. An oldgentleman in this place of respectabilityhas just returned from a visit at Far-West Mo. who is a member of the church & has been almost from it commensmentwho was a man of property, & took Smith& Rigdon into his own house, in theearly part of their Mormon career &treated them with all the tenderness of a brother, or even a parent, when they ^(the mormons)^ were but a handful in number, & despised& hated, he has lent his name with theirthem in their speculations, to his name.When on the visit alluded to they made further demands upon him, which herefused to comply with, for which he was mobed & his life threatened, by the emiss[ar]yof Smith & Rigdon & was obliged to flee for his life. Smith boasts of having at his command as good, an inquisition asany pope ever had. Secret measures were adopted, before Smith left this placeto destroy the inhabitants of Jackson Co. to my certain knowledge, if the confessionsof those who were among the chosen bandto accomplish it, are to be credited. A manformarly one of the 12 apostles of the latter days, son of the old gentleman spoken of abovewas compelled to flee from Zion, this seasonbecause he took exceptions to their procedings& hardly escaped with his life, was fired at13 times before he had rode a mile fromthe city, by men in disguise, some of whom he knew, ^notwithstanding^ to be men in high stand-ing in the Church; Rigdon in a publicdiscourse,(backed up by Smith,) said thatdissenters were like salt that had lost 
 it savour, good for nothing but to be castout & troden under feet of men, & little the hand, or eye that had offended; that these saying were to be litterally fufilledupon dissenters by the saints, that they (dissen-ters) were not fit to live, that God alwaysmake use of his servants, as his ministersof destruction, that when Ananias & Saphinafell down dead, at the apostles feet, that it was, because the apostle killed themthat in the New Testament the story is notall told in relation to such circumstancesbut they obtain, it by revelations direct fromheaven. Also that Peter Killed Judas, orfollowed him out into the field, & while hewas filled with grief, Knocked him down& his bowels gushed out, &c. On about the 10th. Aug. a state warrent was issued, bythe circuit Judge, in Ray Co. for Smith, &Wight, the leaders of the insurriction alluded to above, the [[illegible result, we are waitingwith deep anxiety to asertain, what coursehe will take, I am at a loss to determine,I think he will fight, I understand he says he will resist unto death, & hundredsof his delude followers, are sworn to defendhim under any circumstances, wrightor wrong. Publick meetings, & measureshave been, called & adopted in several of those adjoining counties. What the endwill be is for futurity to disclose, I fear theinocent will suffer with, the guilty, I hopenot. -- these, & many things of a like naturewhich, have been developed within two yearspast which the narrow limits of a sheet [[illegibleare insertion, "I think, will answer your inqu-iry, to my unbelief in "The clean characterof Smiths ministry"With sentiments of RespectI am Sir your obt. Servant,W. Parrish 
 he expected Lea to give a proper account of what he had left him in charge wihththat at his coming he might recieve his own with usury. I feel I am not my ownI am bought with a price even the blood of Jesus Christ, and as a servant I mustsoon give up my accounts. I desire & strive brethren to keep my accounts rightwith the Lord every day that I may meet him with joy. Lea could get away from hismaster but I feel always in the presense of mine & my desire is to live nearerstill that I may be ready at any hour to give up my accounts. Last sabbath wasa day for fasting & prayer with us. The Lord gave us a spirit to pray for bro & sis Leaand we hope after all they will repent like Peter. I think it will be the means of doingus good & makeing us watchful. The brethren & sisters appear to be doing well at thistime and are looking out almost every day for one of the Elders who have come fromAmerica or our father Richards. We are but few & very poor yet we hope to see them soonif the Lord will. I find in the book of Doc & Cov that when a bro or sis breaks the lawsof the land we are to deliver them up to the same. Mr Rawlins has been to me thisday to know where Lea is and what he is doing and how he can write to him. I saidI knew he was at Manchester a little time ago but I know nothing of him now. I sasid Iwill write down to know where he is and will call upon you in a feew days. So Idepend upon you for this information by return of post that I may fulfil my promiseI will enclose a letter written or posted by Lea on the 4 Dec last to show you how aman can act out of sight (yes a priest in the church of Christ) remember this hisconduct at Leicester and the other his writing to me nearly at the same time had I notseen the accounts & letters & insolent notes that he sent to Mr Rawlins I could not havebelieved it but it is so plain I am compelled to believe it. Be pleased to tell bro & sisLea I hope they will set at once and macke up the breach Love &cHere follows an extract from the letter sent by bro Lea to Mr Rawlins LavenderD[ea]r brethren & sisters in Christ—have many times rejoiced with you at Bedford &cbut since that time I have many times ben led to ask myself what am I doinghere doing the Devils work when called to labour in the Lord's vineyard with theservants of the Lord. I have many times de[a]r bro as you wrote to me about drinkingasmoking, singing & swearing & said if I was but out of this and enjoying myselfwith my D[ea]r brethren & sisters singing the praises of God. After stating his griefon account of his present situation & epxpresing a hope of deliverance—he says I hopethis has learned me a lesson not to give ear to man again knowing that theheart of man is decietful above all things & that the tender mercies of thewicked are cruel. When I look at what I am brought to by giving bear to wickedmen I take it as the judgement of God upon me. I know that I have sinnedagainst my heavenly Father & I feel along way from heaven but I hope the Lordwill bring me back again. after adverting to the wicked state of the world &their unpleasant situation & again expressing a hope that they will soonbe delivered he concludes—Lov &c—This is substance of the enclosed letter—

 Philadelphia P.a. Dec 3rd 1844President B. YoungBeloved BrotherImpressed with a deepsens of Duty toward God, toward you, & the quorum of Twelve& the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, I cannotleave the shores of America without unbosoming my feelings toyou more fully than I have hitherto done; their has been a firein my bosom that I have tried to smother in my communicationsto you concerning affairs in the Eastern Churches. I have done it fearingthat you might think me an accusor of my bretheren, & that I should bringdifficulty upon myself; but when I see an influence carrying Death in allits march instead of life, yea death like the upas tree, knowing the varyvitals of the Twelve & the Church, Laying the foundation of our cause, shallI hold my peace, No God forbid. It is true I spoke plain in my formerletters but I ^feel to^ speak tplainer still. Their has been a time since the death of Joseph& Hiram & still is when we want men in the vy vineyard that are men of Godthat will act wisely, build the kindom, strengthen the weak, Deal with mildnessact in concert with the Council in Nauvoo, & not acknowledge the head tobe whare it is, But I must say that I do not believe Elders Wm Smith& G. J. Adams to be such men. I believe their whole influence has gonethroughout the Eastern Churches to gratify their own propensities, rob theChurches for themselves, set themselves up as great men, to gain an influenceunto themselves, crushed evry man that would not assist them to accomplishtheir end, ordain High priest & Exhalt men that would go with them& tried to the fulest Extent to have the power of the eastern Churches in thehands of men that would give them the influence. I have some reasonto believe they have spent hundreds of Dollars of Temple money for theirown use, & I believe the prophet in New York has been an Engine intheir hands to accomplish the same End. The Churches they have visitedthe most are the worst of, & the Rigdon party have got more out ofsuch Churches than any where els. A principle that they call the spiritualwife Doctrin is so instilled into the minds of most of the Elders wharethey have been, that if any one says any thing against prattizing or preaching

 if they think he is an old granny, & weak in the faith, & whodont know that such an order of things will Explode any societyto the four winds of Heaven. I have been in the midst of a numberof fires in this Eastern Land. I have had to contend against Rigdon& his party on the one hand, & stretch out my hand on the other sidewith the greatest wisdom I could get to try to save the Church & the Eldersfrom that that vortex of Recklessness unto which they seemed to beplunging through the influence of Wm & Adams. And all thesethings the quorum of the Twelve have to hear. I feel bad aboutthe eastern Churches they are not out of Danger, the New YorkChurch is in a bad situation, & to cop the climax Wm wrotea peace accusing Winchester of having a hand in murdering his brothers, & hehas got out warrants for him, are about to take Brannan for printing it& have taken ^Elder^ Grant for selling the papers & he has been hand over toappear at court under $1000 dollars bond, & Adams has taken Winchesterfor Slander & all these cases will come up & be investigated to thefulest Extent the character of Joseph & Hiram & the Twelve will be mad[e]as black through falshood as the Lawyers can make them & all Hell israked over to ge testimony against the Twelve, & others Esspecially Wm Smith& Adams, & any imprudence that those men have to been been guiltyof or any one els the Twelve have to learn it.  Wm &  Adams attimes talk much about sustaining the Twelve but I think it ^is^ forEffect more than any thing els. Wm Smith told Elder Grant thatthe Twelve had not sustained him nor had he risen through theirinfluence but on his own, neither should be ^fool himself bound hereafter to defend the character^ sustains ^of^ the Twelve or be^Br Grant thinks he was some excited when he made these remarks^ accountable to that quorum but he was led by visions & revelationsfor himself & he said he & Adams was sworn friends & that Adamsexistance depended upon his. Wm has tried to gain an influence by sayingthat he was the last of the Smith family left that had land the foundationof the Church &c. But by careful observations I can see things croudingout that is leading to Apostacy & acting against our interest, God knowsI dont want to Injure Br Smith nor Br Adams for the sake of the Smithfamily I went Wm said it possible But I know that you ought tobe apprised of things as they are, & this is the reason why I thus write.I Beg of you president Young If you want to save the EasternChurches to delagate some one of the Twelve from Nauvoo that willact with you to come & take charge of them for awhile, or some[sideways text] you will understand I do not write this course as prefering charges before ^the Twelve against^ Adams & Wm Smith for a trial but merely that you may understand the true state of things [end of sideways text]

I received 5 dolls from you from Newark bought about 4 dolls worth of lumber paid balis one & now brother Webster is at work on the housethe other front room and will go to keeping house by themselves when it is done, we have not yet got the flooring. O you do not know how much you are wanted to see about things here, Sister Smith says tell him to come home when Mr. Smith comes, I sup-pose she has written all the news[.] there is much talk of a mob here but I have not had the first anxious thought about it yet[.] the authorities here demolished the press preciselyaccording to law so they have left us (the law party) they tried to land in Madison whenthe left here but the inhabitants would  not  have them there so they went father on up the riverthey tried to get some printing done but the editors there told them that they would not do it for their press was in good repute now. Joseph has had a dream about the the Lawshe thought they bound him and cast him and into a pit (or well like Joseph of old[)] but he made a struggle and got to the top of the well so to look out and he saw a little distancefrom him one of them in the graspe of a tiger the other a snake and they were calling to him to help them he told them they had tied him and he could not help them a brother sooncame along and took brother Joseph out. Our garden does very well[.] brother A Alexander is not going out this season. brother Taylor is waiting for Joseph to say go to him, but there is much excitement here at present and he thinks he had better wait. A messenger has been sent to the governor has gone now I want to seeyou much but had quite as lives you would be away now untill this fuss is over. I received 2 letters from home by Arthur Milliken saying that Luther would not come untillSept. and I think sister Foss not at all I cannot say much to her on mothers account as she tells me she thinks mother would die almost or quite if she should leave. If you go to Maine I want you to buy 2 yds dark brown ribbon 1 inch 1/4 wide and give to motherfor me with a kiss and tell her she has not got a child in the world that loves her betteror will do more for her than her wandering Phebe. give my love to them all and acept much love yourself P.

 man besides Wm or Adams. Elder Grant tells me that Wmis about to visit the Churches again through the East & New Hampshire&c. I saw a letter from him stating that He had AuthorizedElders to collect for money for him to assist him in his LawsuitsI also beg of you not to send Elder Adams into the EasternChurches or any where els untill he can learn thereat their is Authorityin this Church unto whome he is amemiable & has got some Authority & as well as himselffor I believe him to be reckless & do not believe he regards anyauthority in this Church when he is out of the presence of the quorumof the Twelve. He is such a great Apostle to the gentiles that he is head& sholdiers above all others. In those Churches whare they have held swayI could get but little or no assistance to help us on our missionIf I could have borrowed the money I would not have asked fora dollar when I arrived in New York. we had ownly means enough tosecure our passage but nothing to get provisions with & the N. Yorkchurch raised us $2.50 two dollars & fifty cents to help us but theycould help other men I ownly spent the sabbath with them, cameto Philadelphia to hold one meeting with Elder Grant. I found himjust right, with us with all his heart. & notwithstanding the formerdifficulthes the philadelphia Church is in the best order or as good as anyman one East of the mountains that Adams & Wm has visited, & it isin a better state than ever has been since Winchester fraction. ElderGrant is a man after my own heart he is true in all things. his spirit is notcongenal with Adams & Wm but goes with Brigham & the Twelve.Has Elder Smith sent up the $150 for the Temple from the Peterboro Church, & money hehas collected from all the Eastern Churches, $20 or $25 from Vinson Shirtliff ofWestfield. Elder Grant asked me if he should leave for Washington, or anywhereels, I think he has saved the Church in philadelphia I advised him to remind alittle untill the difficulties are a little more over. give him council as yousee fit, he will go whare you say. Beloved Brother I must close. I have writtenwhat I believe, keep an eye upon Br. Wm & Adams. When I get to England if menfight  Joseph & Hiram, that are dead, the Twelve that are living sustain Rigdon & hisparty, introduce & practice the spiritual wife doctrin, for either of these if they dontrepent I will cut them off. I will go with you, give me such council as you thinkbest. I will follow it. If I am doing wrong in any thing tell me of it I will repentof it & leave it. (please take care of this letter let it not hurt me) my respects to the quorum & all who inquire. Yours in the Love of GodW.Elder. Young. the statements of Br.

 Snow at Springtown is about 18 Inches deep andat this place about 6, and only 6 miles apart.

 P.S. I perceive by the news that Bro Gardner Snow ofManti City is elected Probate Judge for this County. He isa very good man; but is completely wraped up in his sonWarren and in George Peacock. The people of Sanpetehave paid Taxes now for many years, and no improvementscan be seen but the jail half finished by Bishop Snow. Itis like all improvements in Manti, unfinished. SeveralBack houses have been begun, but I Know not one finishedThe jail [in?] like condition. $4.500 was the contract pricefor completeing it, as I am told, when $2.000 would build andcomplete a much better building than that would be if finishedThe county is greatly in debt and no improvements that areof much or any use at all. The tithing office has suffered,the county has suffered, the Perpetual Fund has sufferedThe people have suffered by their ◊t◊◊◊◊ being made intost◊◊ys and then into beef. [The?] Indian [department?] hassuffered, Missionaries have suffered by their donations goingin the same way. The people of Sanpete think theB◊◊◊bows have reigned long enough, and that B◊◊◊◊◊◊Dynasty should end. If the county seat were removed[from?] Manti to Moroni or to Springtown it would suit the notions of the people much better. If to MoroniM. D Hamilton should be Probate Judge, if to Springtown, Redick Allred should be appointed the Judge, I haveexpressed no opinion here as to the removal of the county seat, neither any with regard to the [choice?] of a Judge◊.yet the above are my true sentiments and 19 t◊◊◊tethsof the people here would endorse them, the opinion,of our representati◊◊ to the [contrary?] notwithstanding

 St. George Jan 22, 1877Dear Emma,I received your good letter and Nelliesnext morning after I sent my last in which I spoke of theDeath of Sister Martha Smoot. I wrote next dy to Broth& Sister Smoot at provo. I thank you for yourkind feeling towards me. I prize the love of my familyand wish to do what I can to make them comfortablebut being called of God and the presidt of the Churchto officiate in the spiritual things of the Kingdom itof course deprives me of takeing all the time for myfamily and spending my time with them. But I amsatisfied that my mission to St George this winter will beof much benefit to me in many Respects. I was so worndown when I left home that I needed Rest, and the Blessingone may that I had received since I had ben here, thefollowing are some of them. I had had the privilege of Dedicatingthe Temple on the lower portion of it unto the Lord. I have hadthe privilege of doing the first Baptzing, confirming ordaininggiving the 2nd Anointings in the temple and have organized theworking company, and am presiding over the Temple at in thelabor therof. I have been an instrument in the hands of the Lord in Revolutionizing the moral spirit of the City of StGeorge when I came here there had not been but one PrayerMeeting, attended in the City for a year the was one a week, at 
 February 1, 1877To Asahel, Clara, Owen, Blanche, and Alice, My beloved children:You have again the privilege of enjoying the society of your mother, andI am thankful for this. I want to give you all a word of council consideringthe signs of the times, the persecutive of our nation against us and at myown age you cannot reasonably expect to enjoy much more of my society as yourfather in this life, but you have with you your mother.Now if it was the last testimony I was to give you on earth I want to say be kind to your mother. You cannot always expect to have her with you,altho she may live a score of years or more, time will be short. Do not giveway to anger, or say or do anything that you will be sorry for but I pray yoube united with your mother and with each other and look after each others interest.Again I wish to say to you by children, thatIknow that God lives, thatJesus Christ is the Son of God and the Savior of the world, and he shed hisblood to redeem us from death, and God raised up Joseph Smith as a true pro-phet of God, who brought forth the Book of Mormon, and laid the foundationof the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the only true and livingchurch upon the face of the whole earth with which the Lord is well pleased.And the Church of Christ, and the Zion and Kingdom of God has been organized.It is on the earth for the last time, and this church and Kingdom of Godwill stand and fill the whole earth and be thrown down no more forever. Now you all hold this Church and Kingdom of God on earth, and I want you all to pursue a course, so as to never be separated from the Church in time orEternity, and as your father has been called to the apostleship which officeI have held near 49 years and have also been called to stand as the President

 of the Twelve Apostles, now as an apostle, and as your father, I have a rightto council you and give you advice.There is one particular thing I want to impress upon your minds, and thatis study the revelations of God and have faith in them, the Bible, Book of Mormon, and Doctrine and Covenants, and I want you all to begin in your youthto make your wants known to the Lord in prayer, ask him for what you want, not as a ceremony, but in faith, and he will hear you and answer your prayers.Now my children, harken to these sayings and put them into practice.The revelations of God are true and will be fulfilled. I want you all tobe saved and to be with me on the morning of the First Resurrection to dwellwith me forever with God and the Lamb.This is the Prayer of your loving father.Wilford Woodruff

 [S]t George Temple Jan 31, 1879My Dear EmmaDo you know I hardly Ever hada letter that done me more good than the one I gotto Night at 8 oclok from you for I was so anxiousto hear from home. I wrote you and all the familyon the 24, which you will gat all safe I trust. I told Asahel about my Deer hunt. But I was so gratified to hear that you and the family were well duringthis Terrible time of sickness. I could not bear thethought that my children should die and be buriedas some families are. I feel deeply sorry forBrothe & Sister Mousley. It seames impossible to im-part consolatio to such. Bring it home to our own carewhat if we had to bury Nelly, Asahel, Clary, Owen& Blanch, who could give us consolation it is enoughto make one weep at the thought. I feel to thank the Lordthat our family are so far preserved and that Ihave the prospect of seeing them in the flesh when I return home. I know Blanch is my girl. ButI would like to know who Nelly, Asahel Clary & OwenBelongs to I think I have some claim on them if I havenot, I like to know who has, if any body was to tell me I had not they would get themselves into difficulty

 [sideways text]Letter April 13, 1861W. M. Gibson To W. Woodruffabout a newspaperarticle.Rev May 3 1861file in our pigeon hole [end of sideways text]Sacramento, Cal. April 13 1861Dear Brother WoodruffI mail to day a letterto Pres. Young, under cover to br. Clawson. It is in accordance with my design, when I set out, to limit my correspondence with the city to br. Young; and indeed my oppor-tunities will not permit me to extend it; —therefore, dear brother, I do not sit down to write you a letter; — not doubting but that you will be informed of the contents of the one addressed to the office; but to enclose a newspaper slip, which came to my hand after mailing the above letter. The article "Brigham Young, and Louis Napoleon — a parallel,"is a mere squib; and apparently hardly de-serving of attention; but it has some little 
 significance to my mind, which may not beuninteresting to mention. In my frequent dis-cussions with the editors of this journal; andother editors of San Francisco, concerning the political condition of the country; I have had occasion to point out the "Chief of Utah," sometimes in a jocular, sometimes in an earnest manner, as the mood of the com-pany would permit, as the only man showingcapacity to ride on the whirlwind of revolution, and still the political storm. And I have listened to frequent recognitions on the partof thinking individuals, that he was the "only man for the times." This little newspa-per article, is the utterance of an editor, be-lieving more fully in the mission of sove-reignty of Brigham Young, than he dareexpress. You may expect startling revo-lutions in public opinions in California.Do not consider this a letter; but a postscriptto Pres. Young's. Your bro. in the Gospel. W. M. Gibson
