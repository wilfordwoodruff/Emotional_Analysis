 The documents sent for by Brother   Franklin S. Richards have been sent in part. The  dispatches requesting them found us in a bad position  to supply that which he asked for. All our doc-  uments were taken hurriedly out of the Historian  Office and were not left in such an orderly manner  as to enable anyone to readily find any document  that might be needed. Not only did it require a  thorough search of all papers, but unfortunately the   person who knew their whereabouts was not in the  city. This has occasioned great delay. A batch of  documents were sent yesterday; some more will be  sent to-day, though we fear, from Brother Richards'  dispatch, that those sent to-day will not be in time  to answer his purpose. Our attorneys in the Legislature  have been so busily employed that it was almost im-  possible for them to spare the time at once to get  up affidavits of the kind required. If they had had  a little more time, they could have arranged better;  but the Legislature being so near the close of its session  necessarily compelled them to spend the greater part

OF  LATTER-DAY SAINTS,    GIBSON MILLER & RICHARDSON, OMAHA    P.O. BOX B.    Salt Lake City, U. T. March 13th 1888.    Elder Joseph F. Smith,  Washington, D. C.    Dear Brother Joseph F.:    Your esteemed favor of   the 7th inst. has just been received, containing a state-  ment of the amount of funds left in the hands of   Brother John T. Caine, and many particulars which  are very interesting to us concerning your movements  there.    We are not surprised at what we hear  from you respecting the action of Brother John W.   Young; but we regret very much that he should  feel to draw off or to be wounded at the course that  we have taken with him. We can only repeat 
 of benefit to our cause and be the means of giving  Congress and the country a better knowledge of the  action of our Constitutional Convention, &C. It would  seem to us that this perhaps might be done by him  to advantage. As you are on the ground, however,  and can see all the reasons for and against such a   course, we think it better to submit this question  to you.    Naturally speaking, we should say, make  the speech, if it could be made carefully and with  a conservative tone. But there may be reasons, the  weight of which we cannot fully realize here, for deem-  ing such a course impolitic under present circumstances.  You, doubtless, have opportunities by this time to  consult with our friends. We think it would be well,  therefore, for you to converse freely with them upon  this subject and get their views concerning it. If they  see no grave objection to a speech of this character,  we certainly would be very much in favor of it.  In our reply to Brother Caine, we have told

 of their time in that body, or great injury might be  done by hasty and ill-considered legislation.    I have had a quorum of the Twelve  within reach now for some little time past. I think  it important that when needed we can have a quorum  of our Council, so that the responsibility may be borne  by the Quorum. Questions are constantly arising of  an important character, and I do not wish any of  us to be placed in a position where it could be said  by absent ones that if they had been present they  should have recommended a different policy. Besides,  I think it due to the brethren that having the  responsibility they should have the opportunity of giv-  ing their views. We had a meeting last night;  there were present nine of the Twelve—myself, Brothers  E. Snow, F. D. Richards, Geo. Q. Cannon, B. Young, M.   Thatcher, F. M. Lyman, J. H. Smith, and H. J. Grant.    Respecting ex-Senator Pomeroy, you  will learn, doubtless, considerable from Maude and how  far he can be trusted. 
 him that we should correspond with you upon the  subject, and that we desired him to consult with you  and to be governed by your suggestions and counsel,  whether to make the speech or not.    The article which Brother Penrose sent to   us, I am clearly of the opinion, should not be pub-  lished at the present time. I am fully persuaded  that our enemies would take advantage of it; and  while it would be limited in its circulation and  would reach but comparatively few hands, the com-  ments made upon it and misrepresentations of it  would be widely circulated. If an announcement of  this kind is to be made at all from us, we are of  the opinion that it would be better to come from  Brother Caine on the floor of the House than  from the columns of the News.    We write this without stopping to give  you any local news, much of which you can gain  from the newspapers. 
 what we have said several times before, that we  have not had the most distant idea of doing any-  thing, in any form, to hurt his influence, to deprive  him of any credit, or to, in any manner, curtail him  in any of his legitimate labors. It would have been  a great pleasure to us to have seen him take such a   course in our transactions that we could have spoken  with unqualified praise concerning his labors, and given  him every credit to which he could be in the least  degree entitled. If we fail in making him believe  that these are our feelings, then we do not think we  are to blame, though we are sorry to be so unfortun-  ate, for these are our genuine feelings and they  have been in all that we have said and done. But  we have felt that while we were willing to accord  him all this, he should also respect us in our  place sufficiently to communicate to us the purposes  for which he wished to obtain money and also  the directions in which he intended to operate, not  for any personal gratification to us, or to yield 
 I see no objections to your paying for the  clippings which you mention in your last favor. Of  course, if they are of no benefit to you there, it is not  worth while paying for them; but if they are, the price  for a clipping is not much more than would have to  be paid for the paper containing it, if we had to buy  it ourselves.    With love to yourself, Brothers John W. Young,  John T. Caine, F. S. Richards, C. W. Penrose, L. J. Nuttall,  and Geo. F. Gibbs, and still praying the Lord to be  with you in all your deliberations and movements, and  to preserve you from the hands of your enemies,    We remain,  Your Brethren,    Wilford Woodruff  Geo.

 deference to any power that we might assume to  have, but because by so doing we could work to  better advantage, as we would know whether he  was interfering with other agencies that were operating  in our behalf, with which he was not familiar; and  also that we might be able to account in a proper  manner to the Church and the people at large for  the proper disposition of the public funds which  they, in their confidence, had placed in our hands  to be expended as our judgment and the Spirit of  the Lord would suggest to us as proper. It seems  to us that the requests we have made of Brother  John W. have been very simple and that they  should not have injured his feelings or wounded his  pride. We certainly have not intended to ask any-  thing more of him than is required of us by those  who have entrusted funds in our keeping.    We are glad that you have been able to  obtain direct communication with No. 3, and that you 
 We regret that Brother John W. Young should  feel as you describe. His expressions concerning being  left in the lurch or being crushed have no founda-  tion in fact. There has been no such disposition  manifested by the Committee towards him. We have  treated him with all the consideration and respect  that could be reasonably asked. Certainly we have   tried to treat him with more courtesy than we think  we have received. If he will only reflect as he should  do, he will see that there has been no manifestation  on our part to do him the least injury, or to treat  him in any way that should displease an honorable  and upright man. The Committee certainly have ask-  ed no more from him than they themselves are  expected to perform. Money is placed in their  hands; but they will have to account for its expendi-  ture; and this is but reasonable. Confidence cannot be  maintained in any other way. We owe it to ourselves  and our future reputations that we should be able to   render a strict account of all that passes through our  hands, so that no suspicion can arise as to our

Dear Brother Joseph F.:    Your esteemed favor of the 17th  inst. has been received and perused with much interest.  You have been very careful to give us full details of  affairs with you, which have been very satisfactory, as  from your letters we have gained an excellent idea of  the situation. Your position has not been an en-  viable one, still we think you have got along excellently.    The information which you communicated  to us enables us to understand the position assumed  by Brother John W. Young and will enable us to talk  with him more intelligently than we could do if we had 
 have also ascertained definitely the arrangement that  has been made with McDonald, Bright, and Fay. It  will doubtless be to advantage if you can get a more  complete understanding of the obligations that have  been assumed concerning Gov. C. F. Black. We agree  with the brethren in thinking that you should still  retain McDonald, Bright, and Fay, on the terms which  have been agreed upon.    The telegraph has brought us informa-  tion concerning the result of Baskin's argument before  the Committee. We were pleased to receive this from  you and to see in the Herald and the News the   public announcement, from private dispatches sent to  these papers, of what had taken place. It will be  gratifying to the entire people to read the results of   his attempt to poison the minds of the Committee  against Utah. Taken as a whole, so far as we  have been able to learn from your letters and dispatches  and all that has come to hand, we have no reason

We know that it is the  only way that we can take to inspire confidence  and to remove feelings of distrust. We sincerely hope  that he will see the propriety of the request that  we have made, and that he will join heartily with  you in your labor and manifest that confidence in  making known his plans that you desire.    My health is good, as well as that of all  the brethren, so far as I know. The weather has  been somewhat wintry since the last of February.  With love to yourself, to Brothers Caine, Young,  Richards, Penrose, Nuttall, and Gibbs, in which the  brethren join,    I remain  Your Brother,    W Woodruff    [sideways text] Wilford Woodruff  Rec'd Mar. 12, 1888  Ans'd [Mar.] 13 —[1888]— [end of sideways text] 
 telegraphed with some degree of freedom, and trust that  you have been kept advised to your satisfaction.    We heard with great regret concerning the   failure of the Huntington Company to keep your contract.  It seems strange that Mr. Curtis should not have  known of the intention to make this change early enough  to have not made such a contract as he did. The general  hope is that you have been able to make satisfactory  arrangements with the Guion Co. The feelings of the  brethren are very strongly in favor of that Company, as  we know your own are. Bro Geo. Teasdale has written  a number of letters upon the subject of maintaining our  old relations with the Guion Co. and seemed to be  greatly exercised over the danger there appeared to be  of our connection with it being broken.    We have been much embarrassed by the  division of views which appear to exist between our  legal counsel. From your reports the attorneys there  seem to be united in thinking that Sheets' case is not  a good one on which to appeal. The attorneys here  are all united in thinking that it is a good case.

 not been thus enlightened. We had a meeting with him  last evening. Through having to attend a meeting of  the City Council, he did not keep his appointment  by three-quarters of an hour. We stayed together till  11 o'clock and then had to break up somewhat abruptly  to return to our quarters or we might have been kept  hours longer. We have made another appointment for  to-morrow evening.    We had a very plain talk with him.  I (President Woodruff) spoke quite plainly to him con-  cerning the position that you and the other brethren   were in at his house, and that some arrangement should  be made about it; that his refusal to take pay for  your board, &C., placed you in a very delicate position.  He made quite an explanation in reply to this; said  that he had proposed to accept the pay on donation  to the Fund, and he had also proposed that the expenses  of the house be kept for one month and be divided  proportionately. We asked him how this had resulted,  and he said the month had not yet expired. He 
 to be discouraged at the results of this investigation  before the Senate Committee. On the contrary, it is  very encouraging to know that there has been such a  clear exposition of the truth, and evidence so incontro-  vertible given concerning the conduct of officials in  this Territory and other matters pertaining to the  general situation.    The visits which are being made by  the brethren to the leading men, as we have often  said, cannot fail to be of great good. It is mission-  ary work that has a direct influence upon our case,  and in taking this course we do our duty and leave  a responsibility upon them which they would not  have to bear if it were not for the information that  is thus imparted to them. It may be that this  course, in some instances, will only make those who ^are^  disposed to endeavor to thwart us more active in  their operations; but it will certainly raise up many  friends, modify prejudice, and dissipate much of the 
 This division appears unfortunate. We have sent Bro.  Richards word ^by telegraph^ to day (as we thought, perhaps, you  might be in New York) giving him the views of our  attorneys here and leaving the matter for the decision  of the attorneys at Washington. Under the circumstances,   we think this the best we can do, as time is so short.    There is another question underlying all  this, which we have had forced upon us, and that is,  If No. 5's view is correct concerning the probable decision  of U. S. Supreme Court respecting the constitutionality of  the law, is it a wise thing for us to push our case  to such a decision? Some attorneys here favor doing  this, even if the decision should be adverse. But it is  a matter that should be very well considered in all its  bearings, and on this account we telegraphed you the  other evening to hear from you what the united wishes  and views of yourselves and our friends would be upon  this question.

 ignorance that prevails upon our question.    Your statement of the expenditures is  quite satisfactory, and whatever may be necessary to do  in settling with McDonald & Co., or Gov. Black, or  others, of course, you will feel yourself at liberty to do,  so as to fulfil all contracts. Some of the items which  have been paid do not belong to us as a State Com-  mittee to pay Mr. Gibson's salary, &c.    We have had another communication  from Maude since our last to you; it was dated New  York. He stated that he had not yet met you; that  you were absent, he thought, when he was at Washing-  ton. He had been in New England, arranging about  newspapers, and writes quite encouragingly. We are  greatly pleased at the interest which he continues to  manifest, and we trust that the spirit which he has  had prompting him in his labors in this direction  will continue to rest upon him. We hope you will  be able to see him and learn from him all that 
 had told his wife, however, that as they kept the  best rooms they ought to pay a larger proportion, and  also for any extra attendance, &C. He also intimated  that if others had their expenses paid, he was entitled  to consideration on that account.    We repeated to him what we had be-  fore said in letters respecting money that had been  advanced to him, that we were startled when he  asked for Twenty-five thousand dollars more, without  giving us the least idea as to what had been done  with the Fifteen thousand which he had already re-  ceived, or even making plain to us how the Twenty-five  thousand was to be expended. Forty thousand dollars  was a large sum of money, and in our position we  could not possibly advance it without understanding  more about it than we did. He expressed himself  that our present line of action was not likely to be  favorable for admission this session, or even next session.  It is clear from what he said that he thinks our 
 Salt Lake City, January 22nd, 1896.    Pres. Wilford Woodruff & Counselors,  City,    Dear Brethren:    Since our conversation with you yesterday, and the agree-  ment which was then made for the formation of a syndicate, and having  heard the expressions of yourselves and Brethren that you desired some  arrangements made whereby your mining properties in Southern Nevada  might no longer be a burden to you, which they have thus far been, we  have given the subject careful consideration, and hereby make the follow-  ing proposition to you for the management of the Sterling and Confidence   properties:    We will assume charge of both of these companies if you desire it on  the following conditions:    (1) You are to temporarily carry the financial obligations which  you have already contracted for this property, allowing us such reason-  able time as you may think proper to allow for us to place the mines  under competent supervision and management, when we guarantee to gradual-  ly relieve you of the debts incurred on these properties.    (2) We are to receive the unsold treasury stock for division among  the four members of the syndicate who now have no fincancial interest in  the company, viz: James Jack, Nephi W. Clayton, Frank J. Cannon and  Abraham H. Cannon, who are to receive equal shares of this stock, which  amounts to about four thousand shares; also an equal share in any other  stocks which they^,^ with your moral influence^,^ can induce Brothers Orson  Smith and J. E. Langford to donate, in view of the fact that we are to  assume all financial burdens with your heo^l^p, and to take active manage-  ment of the company's affairs.    (3) The sale of any or all of the property is only to occur with  your full approval and under your advice.    Our intention is, should this proposition be acceptable to you, to  immediately secure capable men to locate at Sterling and Confidence.  These men we would expect to for^e^see and provide for all necessities of   the company so that the mills might be kept in constant operation. We  would expect weekly reports from them, and all accounts, either for  wages or supplies would be paid direct from this city, where the accounts, 
 and Wilson, upon receiving your telegram requesting an  answer, a reply was sent rather favoring the employment  of Mr. Wilson. Afterwards, on receiving your communi-  cation and seeing the shape things were assuming in  Washington, we thought it would be better not to  employ him at the present time, if you had not already  done so. We presume, however, that you probably had  done so before we sent the second telegram.    We gather from your remarks that Brother  John W. Young has had several persons whom he has  retained, and to whom he has been giving pay. It is  just as well that you should keep as clear from them  as you can consistently with the honorable fulfillment of  any arrangements that he may have made.    As for Mr. Curtis, we think that his  connection with us had better cease at the close of the  year, which, we suppose, will be on the 15th May, ac-  cording to his statement. It would be well probably  for Bro. F. S. Richards to notify him to this effect, 
 present method of operations will not result in accomplish-  ing the end we have in view. He thought political re-  sources ought to be exhausted before missionary work  should be engaged in. Upon being interrogated as to  what he meant by this, he spoke in a vague sort of a  way about the nine Senators who had met at Senator  Call's, and that they ought to have been kept together  and more added to them, and they made missionaries  for us, to convert others; and in this connection alluded  to excursions which they frequently took and dinners which  they often had together, and that they ran in "sets", and  that in this way one might be made to convert the  other. We could not see why the present action of  the brethren in visiting Members and Senators and  enlightening them concerning the true position of affairs  in Utah should interfere in the least with such a  plan as he had in view, and asked him how this  could interfere; why the two plans could not work  harmoniously. Upon this point we did not get 
 you can.    The land boom here is the chief excitement  we have among us at the present time. It amounts  to almost a craze in some quarters. The city is full  of people buying land or talking about it. Real  estate agents are multiplying on every hand. Prices  have gone up wonderfully. Some idea of the infatu-  ation that has seized upon the people can be formed  by noticing an item in last Sunday's Herald, in  which it was stated that 32 acres near Geo. Q. Cannon's  were sold for $600.00 an acre. You know what  kind of land it is in that vicinity and how little  value it possesses intrinsically for farming or for  residences.    The Legislative Assembly had a very pro-  tracted legislative day; it did not close until just after  midnight on Saturday night, the 10th inst. While the  Assembly were not able to gain every point they wished,  still, on the whole, there is reason to be satisfied

 unless he prefers that a letter should come from here.    Mr. Bushnell's visit to Paddock, we trust,  will be attended with the desired effect.    You mention the name of Mr. Bowers in  connection with the Chief Justiceship, and ask whether  this is in harmony with our friends, &C. Seth is the  man that they have been urging and are still desirous  to obtain; but it was suggested that if he was likely  to miss, another man should be put forward that could  be relied upon. Whether this man is the one or not  we cannot say; but we shall learn as quickly as possible.    We are glad that the brethren are able to  reach such men as Senators Pugh and McPherson and  correct the misconceptions which they entertained concerning  us and our conduct, and we trust that the effect will  be better upon them than the interview with Senator  Davis appears to have had on him    We meet on all sides expressions of  regret at the utterances of the speakers at Conference. 
 satisfaction. He evidently thinks, and so expressed  himself, that money is the all-important factor to be  used. Upon this our views were expressed with great  frankness, that we did not believe in a money campaign;  we had not money enough, we thought, to spend in   the way he indicated. While money is doubtless nec-  essary for various purposes, and might be used judiciously  to aid men who are in straits, to use it as he proposed  was entirely contrary to our feelings and we think it  most impolitic. It would undoubtedly make the "lobby"  hungry, and it would come to the knowledge of these  acute fellows that we were spending money. No man  could receive it scarcely without somebody being aware  of it. He did not agree with us on this; he thought  that his method of using means would only be known  to himself and the parties. He appeared to think  that the great difficulty with him was that he could  not sit down and write and explain things as other men  did; he was more for action; and it was to this that 
 with the success which they had with the Governor. He  yielded more than our folks did, and most of the  members felt very well satisfied with what they gained.  There has been a disposition, however, to expend more  lavishly than our funds would altogether warrant; but  one heavy expense was cut off—that asked for by the  Directors of the Insane Asylum. The members were  firm in resisting this, though the Governor had been  lobbied with by friends of the Asylum to veto the   Appropriation bill unless the amount they asked for  should be inserted. Doubtless the action of these  lobbyists contributed to the veto in the first place of  the Reform School bill and the Agricultural College  appropriation. The banking bill passed, but not in  as good shape as we would like; still it is thought  we can organize under it.    Steps will be taken to have proper  credentials sent down for our sisters to represent our  Territory in the approaching convention. 
 Our friends declare that great injury has been done by  what was said, and they expressed a feeling of shame,  because these utterances seem to put them in the position  of having made false statements. No one could have  been more surprised at these utterances than ourselves and  a number of the brethren of the Twelve, because it was  understood that care would be exercised upon these  points.    We have just received a letter, signed by your-  self, Bros. Penrose & Richards, in relation to getting delegates  to the National Convention. The suggestions which you  make about Hadley D. Johnson have been considered;  but it would be impracticable, it is thought, to use  him. We are taking other steps to see if we can  effect something in the direction which you mention.  We think it very important that this matter should  be attended to, and that no pains should be spared  to prevent the insertion into the Democratic Platform  of anything reflecting upon us. 
 he attributed his lack of explanations concerning funds  and other matters. He freely acknowledged that he had  not done right, and that he could not blame us, under  the circumstances.    Just before we parted he mentioned  that he had in contemplation the organization of a   National Bank in Utah. He said that he had had   conversation with the Comptroller and had endeavored  to get the privilege of calling it the National Bank of  the State of Utah; but that for political reasons this  had been deemed unwise. He said that he had much  to say on this subject; but as we had not time to  listen, it was deferred. He intimated, however, that  the little bank and his bank might work in har-  mony and control affairs. Of course, we had very  little to say upon this subject, as we did not know  enough about his plans to answer except in a general  way. We feel as you do, that all his transactions  here should be explained, and we shall do what we

The more I have meditated concerning  the Events of the last days the more I have desired to see my   Father & Friends spend the Remnant of their days with the  Saints at least inasmuch as they should have any Desire to   do so & I wish here to Remark that I think you could  get a Living in Nauvoo by your trade as well as in the   East & not labor as hard as you now do for wages are   nearly or quite as high here as in the east & provisions not   more than one half or third as high we have two Steam Mills  & one water Mill in constant operation in Nauvo & othrs  will probably soon be built I^&^ I can get you a place   in any Mill their is here I presume. I have had o^t^he offer   of it in the two last ones the water mill grinds about   100 bushels of wheat & corn in 24 hours with onee very small  pair of stones Burr, they have a plenty of power & expect to  put in a large pair of Burr & will do Better Business the  I spoke to the owner about you & he said he should be glad  to give you Employ should you ever come here. The Steem   Steem Mill owned by the Laws grinds about 400 bushels  in twenty four hours. he also told me he would give you   Employ should you come to Nauvoo. the water mill has  for toll one fifth or fourth & the Steem Mill one third corn &  one fourth wheat. I spoke to them about you & they manifested   a desire to give you Employ should you I speak of these things  to you so that should you have a desire to gather with the Saints  that you need not be discouraged about getting Labor or a   Living as their are a number employed in these Mills you could   have little or much to do as you liked. But for my part   I desire that you may not have as much hard work &   care through the remainder of your days as you have done   through your life thus far & I should not ownly essteem it  a Duty but a pleasue to do any thing in my power to render   you comfortable & happy in your Decline of Life & I have thought     
 We have remembered you to our friends with  whom we have stayed, all of whom take interest in  you and your labors and in hearing from you.  With love to yourself, Brother Jno. W.

 Dear Parents, I hope you nor none of my friends will think me   assuming while addressing you upon spiritual Subjects I have but one   motive in view & that to clean my garments of all whether they be Parents  Brethren Sisters Neighbours Priest or People Kings or rullers whareever  my My Master calls. My motive is ^to^ act for the best good of all my  fellowmen. But O how changed the scene a few months since my   mind was flushed with the idea of accumilateing something of this worlds   goods that I might enjoy the society of my Parents in their decline of  life with other friends not knowing because the prophets were dead &  the fathers fallen asleep but what all things would continue as they were  from the beginning. But now the scene is changed while I am called  to forsake Parents Brethren Sisters houses lands to go fourth as a lamb   among wolfs, to assist in pruning the vineyard for the last time yea  to Jews as well as gentile to visit foreign climes & the Islands of   Sea to endure the perils of chains, vaults, dungeons, scourgings, &  every epithet than^t^ an indignant wicked generation can heap  upon my head for the testimony of Jesus Christ which is the spirit   of prophecy. With these Eternal truths resting upon my mind  I say unto you my Dear friends in the name of Jesus Christ &  by the authority of the Priesthood confered upon me that I do not   war at uncertainty I do not fight as those that beat the air I know   in whohm whom I trust. I was not called by man nor by the   will of a man by^u^t by the revelation of Jesus Christ therefore I intreat  you to receieve my testimony when I say to one & all of my friends to   whom my pen or voice may reach to repent & be Baptized for the  remishion of your sins that you may receieve the Holy Ghost by the laying   on of hands of those who are ordained unto that power for this promise is   unto you & unto your Children & to all that are afar off even as many   as the Lord our God shall call. I say again the cause of Latter Day Saints   is not fals, is not quakerisms, Catholicism, or secret it is openly manifest   before the world as much as the Church was in the days of Jesus Christ. The   Book of Mormon is the word of God it is true it is a precious treasure, it  is the record of the tribe of Joseph it is the stick of Joseph in the hands of Ephraim  we hold it as sacred as we do the Bible & no more so for Testimony see   ##Genesis 49:22-27|Gen 49ch 22: to 27## ##Deuteronomy 33:13-18|Deut 33ch 13 to 18##, ##Psalms 85:11-12|Psalms 85ch 11:12## ##Revelations 14:6|Rev 14ch6##, ##Isaiah 29:8-24|Isaiah 29ch 8 to 24##: ##Ezekiel 37:16-28|Ezekiel 37ch  16 to 28## ##Genesis 48:16|Gen 48ch 16##; ##1 Chronicles 5:1-2|1st Chron 5ch 1:2## ##Jeremiah 31:9|Jer 31ch 9##, ##Hosea 8:12|Hosea 8ch 12##, ##John 10:16|St John 10ch 16##. Now I say is not   Ephraim a multitude of nations in the midst of the Earth upon this continent   were not the tribe of Joseph sheep as much as much as the tribe of Judah at  Asia is not the Book of Mormon the record of the tribe of Joseph as much  as the Bible of the tribe of Judah it certainly is All the meek & honest  of the Earth that will read the Book of Mormon without prejudice & ask  God in the name of Jesus Christ for his spirit & light & truth & are willing  to obey His commands to such I say they will have the Spirit of God to   lead them into the light of the Book of Mormon they will receieve it & believe   it is true as their is a God in Israel

 Again I testify that the Church of Christ of Later Day Saints is traveling  out of the wilderness & is esstablished upon the foundations of the Ancient   Apostles & Prophets Christ Jesus the chief corner Stone yea possessing  the gifts & graces that Jesus said should follow the believer she has her  Prophets, Apostles, Evangelest, Pastors, Teachers Wisdom knowledge, faith  healings, Toungues, interpettations, &c yea Joseph Smith Jr is a   true Prophet of the most High God & the word of God is costantly  fulfilling that came forth by the mouths of that prophet unto this  generation & he will stand Blessed upon this Earth when the hail  sweeps away the reffuge of ties that his eniemies have hid th^i^mselfs   under as to his bringing forth revelations, to send the poor to Zion   & keeping the rich at Kirtland is as fals as the [Alolraran]. You  do not hear but vary little truth respecting him or the Church  what from the report of the Day however respectable the scourse   may appear As it respects what Sister Elizabeth said I have no  knowledge of the case I know not who the person was But admiring   that case to be all true what does it argu[e] it Prooves that he was  out of the way & did evil but that does not Proove the work or  Body to be fals no more than because Peter Denied his Lord should   make Christ a fals Prophet & all the Apostles wolfs in sheeps clothing [##Matthew 26:69-75##]  As it respects Brother Azmon's leeving the Church & advising me to do the  same I have ownly to say I wrote him a letter in great plain [page smudged]  the subject & I cleared my garments at that time in so doing I [page smudged]  the cause I have ingaged in is of God it will stand the [^w^reck] of empires [page smudged]  when every other system is destroyed it will stand I have no desire to  deprive Br Azmon the privilege of thinking & doing as he sees fit I certanly  wish him well in all things temporal & spiritual & all other relatives  But O my God must I view the gentiles, my country, Neighbours  & my Kinsman doomed to famin, fire, blood & sword &  not the least exertion make to rescue them from that vortex which  will overtake this generation as in the days of Lot & Noah I say most   I retire in peace from this scenery (which I Know is coming upon the   Earth) with out lifting the warning voice unto my Kinsman as well as  others Let God forbid for I will arise in the strength of Elijahs God   & combat error with everlasting truth & in the name of Jesus Christ  I will warn this generation to flee out of Babylon literally to that  thay may escape her sins & plagues by fleeing unto Zion & stand in holy  places while Judgments work One year shall not roo^l^l over my head  (if God will) before I will stand before you my Parents & other  Kinsman in Connecticut & proclaim the truth by word of mouth  None knows my sensations & feelings but those in like circumstances  who have seen felt & know by dreams, visions & revelations the [er^c^rtainty]  & nearness of those things that are comeing upon the Earth. I marvel I wonder  while beholding the signs of the times & seeing the blindness of man. My  Parents My Kinsman what motive can I have to try to deceieve you upon  these eternal Events do I not know whereoff I affirm do I not know the reality  of the church of Lateerday Saints better than those who ownly know from report I   do I do not deceieve.

We have abundant occasion, and we rejoice exceed-  ingly at the privilege we have had of beholding so many   thousands of our brethren and sisters as were assembled  at the late conference, and for the most perfect harmony   and good feeling that prevailed throughout all their   deliberations; for the great amount of valuable instruc-  tions by President Joseph Smith and others; and for the   disposition which we have seen manifested by all who   were present to carry into effect all those noble plans   and principles which were derived from heaven, and   have been handed down to earth, to carry forward the  great and glorious work which is already commenced,  and which must be consummated to secure the salvation  of Israel.      While the minutes of the General Conference are be-  fore you, which will be read with interest by every lo-  ver of Zion, we shall recapitulate some items, and detail   more particularly to the understanding of those who  had not the privilege of being present on that interest-  ing occasion, the past, present and future situation and   prospects of the church, and the stakes, and those things  which immediately concern their best interests.      A short time since and the saints were fleeing before   their enemies. Whips, imprisonments, tortures and  death stared them in the face, and they were compelled   to seek an asylum in a land of strangers. They sought  they found it within the peaceful bosom of Illinois; a   State whose citizens are inspired with a love of liberty;  whose souls are endued with those noble principles of  charity and benevolence which ever bid the stranger   welcome and minister to his wants: in this State, whose   soil is vieing with its citizens in all that is good and  lovely, the saints have found a resting place, where,   freed from tyranny and mobs, they are beginning to real-  ize the fulfilment of the ancient prophets, "they shall   build houses and inhabit them, plant vineyards and eat   the fruit thereof, having none to molest or make afraid."      In this city the church has succeeded in securing sev-  eral extensive plots of land, which have been laid out in  city lots, a part of which have been sold, a part has   been distributed to the widows and orphan, and a part  remains for sale. These lots are for the inheritance of  the saints, a resting place for the church, a habitation for  the God of Jacob; for here he has commanded a house  to be built unto his name where he may manifest himself  unto his people as in former times, when he caused the   ark, the tabernacle, and the temple to be reared, and the  cloud and the fire to rest down thereon; and not that the  temple be built only, but that it be completed quickly, and   that no more general conference be held, till it shall be   held therein; and that the Nauvoo House be finished for the   accommodation of the brethren from afar, and the stran  ger who shall come up hither to inquire after the work  of the Lord and worship in his Temple.      Scores of brethren in this city, have offered to board  one and two labourers each till the Temple is completed;  many have volunteered to labour continually, and the  brethren generally are giving one-tenth part of their   time, or one-tenth part of their income, according to cir-  cumstances; while those sisters, who can do nothing  more, are knitting socks and mittens, and preparing gar-  ments for the laborers, so that they may be made as com-  fortable as possible during the coming winter. In view  of these things we would invite our brethren for many   miles distant around us, to send in their teams for draw-  ing stone, lumber, and materials for the buildings; and  at the same time load their wagons with all kinds of grain  and meat, provision and clothing, and hay and provender   in abundance, that the laborer faint not, and the teams be  made strong; also that journey men stone cutters, &c.  come, bringing their tools with them, and enlist in the  glorious enterprise.      Most of the plats in this city before referred to, as well  as several farms and large lots of land in this and the ad-  joining counties are paid for. and are secured to the  church by good and sufficient titles; while the town  plat for the town of Warren near Warsaw, is secured on   such conditions that the brethren can be accommodated   with lots on very reasonable terms; but the large plat  in Nauvoo, purchased by Messrs. Hotchkiss, Tuttle & Co.  of New Haven, Conn., remains unpaid for, and the time  has now arrived, when it is very desirable on the part of  the church, as well as on the part of the gentlemen of  whom it was purchased, that payment should be made  and a warrantee title secured; to accomplish which we  have been called upon by the united voice of the Gene-  ral Conference to address the churches in the eastern  states, to advise with the brethren in those regions, and  devise ways and means whereby this debt may be liqui-  dated, Hotchkiss & Co. satisfied, the plat secured to the  church, and the brethern in the east at the same time  transfer their real estate from the place where it now is,  to this city or region of country, according to their de-  sire.      The contract for the "Hotchkiss purchase" in Nauvoo,  consisting of upwards of five hundred acres, was entered  into, on, or about the 9th of August. 1839, for the specified  sum of fifty three thousand five hundred dollars, and se-  curity was given to Messrs. R. H. Hotchkiss, Smith Tut-  tle, and John Gillet, for the amount of the same in two  notes of equal amount, one payable in ten years, and the  other in twenty years from the date thereof, signed by  Messrs. Hyrum Smith, Joseph Smith, and Sidney Rigdon.  In August last, interest to the amount of six thousand  dollars or upwards, had accumulated on sailnotes which  it has not been in the power of the church to pay up to  the present time. The nature of this purchase, and the  situation of the church is such, that it is necessary that  the notes should be taken up, the interest stopped, and a   warrantee title secured immediately; and a correspon-  dence is now in progress with Messrs. Hotchkiss & Co.  to effect this thing, and bring forward a final settlement.      But, say you, what can we do to accomplish this great  and desirable object? Let the brethren in the eastern  states, who have lands which they wish to dispose of, so  that they may remove hither and secure to themselves  an inheritance among the saints, either in the cities or  farms in the vicinity, and are willing to have their lands  in the east made over to Messrs. Hotchkiss & Co. towards  the payment of the foregoing notes, communicate with  us immediately, at this place,stating to us the extent and   value of their property. Then as soon as we shall have  received communications concerning property sufficient  to cancel the obligations, and the necessary prelimina-  ries are understood with Messrs.Hotchkiss & Co. we will  dispatch an agent to New Haven, to complete the nego-  ciation, transfer your property, take up the notes, and  secure a deed; and those whose property is thus trans-  ferred can have the value thereof here, in city lots, or  lands in the vicinity; and thus your property will prove   to you as good as money, inasmuch as you desire to emi-  grate, and you will no longer be obliged to tarry afar off,  because that money is so scarce you cannot sell and get  your pay. If there are those among you to whom God  has given in abundance, and they desire to appropriate  some portion thereof for the beenfit of his people, for the  redemption of Zion; for a blessing to the widows of those   who have been slain for the word of God, and been bu-  ried in a well, for a sustenance for their fatherless chil  dren, and provide for them a habitation, they cannot do  it more effectually than by devoting a portion of their  sustenance towards liquidating this claim.      To those brethren who live so far distant that they  cannot send in their loaded teams,and yet desire to assist   in building the Lord's house, we would say, gather   yourselves together and bring of your substance, your  silver, and gold, and apparel, and of your superabundance  cast into the treasury of the Lord and see if he will not  pour you out a blessing till there is not room enough to   ceive it.      Brethren, the blessings of the kingdom are for you, for   the body of Christ, for all the members, and God will   help those who help themselves, and bless those   who will bless each other, and do as they would be done   unto. The gold and the silver is the Lords; all the trea-  sures of the earth, the flocks and the herds of the fields  and the cattle of the thousand hills are his; if he were   hungry would he crave thy food, or thirsty would he   ask thy drink? Nay: he would only ask that which was  his own, he would feast on his own flocks, and quench   his thirst at his own springs. This God is the God of   the saints; he is your God, and he has made you stewards  of all that has been committed to you, and will require   his own with usury; and will you not be faithful in a   little that you may be made rulers over many cities?   Yes, you will, we know you will.      The journeyings and gatherings, and buildings of the  saints are nothing new, and as they are expecting, look  ing, and praying for the completion of the dispensation   of the fullness of times, they must also expect that their   progress will be onward or they will be of no avail, for   what is not of faith is sin, and can you believe that God   will hear your prayers, and bring you on your journey,   gather you, and build your houses, and you not put forth   one hand or make one exertion to help yourselves? No;  therefore inasmuch as the saints believe that father   Abraham journeyed to a distant land, at the command of  the Highest, where himself and household (whose house-  hold we are, if we keep the commandments) might en-  joy the fruits of their labors unmolested, and worship   the God of heaven according to the dictates of their own  conscience and his law. That his seed afterwards gath-  ered to Canaan, the Land of Promise; that David was   commanded to build a house, where the son of man   might have a place to lay his head, and the disciples be   endued with power from on high, and were with one ac-  cord in one place; they must also believe that this dis-  pensation comprehends all the great works of all former   dispensations; and that the children must gather as did   the fathers; must build a house, where they may be en-  dued, and be found together worshipping and doing as   their fathers did, when Jehovah spake and the angels of   heaven ministered unto them; and if these things are   not in this generation, then we have not arrived at the  dispensation of the fullness of times as we anticipate,  and our faith and prayers are vain.      Is it possible that we labour in vain, and toil for nought,   and that we shall be disappointed at the last? No, we   know assuredly that the set time to favor Zion has come  and her sons and daughters shall rejoice in her glory.   The time has come when the great Jehovah would have a   resting place on earth, a habitation for his chosen, where   his law shall be revealed, and his servants be endued  from on high, to bring together the honest in heart from   the four winds; where the saints may enter the baptis-  mal font for their dead relations, so that they may be  judged according to men in the flesh, and live according  to God in the spirit, and come forth in the celestial king-  dom; a place over which the heavenly messengers  may watch and trouble the waters as in days of old, so   that when the sick are put therein they shall be made   whole; a place where all the ordinances shall be made   manifest and the saints shall unite in the songs of Zion,   even praise, thanksgiving, and hallelujahs to God and   the Lamb, that he has wrought out their deliverance, and  bound Satan fast in chains.      What then shall we do? Let us all arise, and with one  united mighty exertion, by the strength of Israel's   God, oppose the powers of darkness, and every being   and principle that may rise up against us, and complete   the work already commenced. Let us not for a moment   lend an ear to evil and designing men who would sub-  vert the truth, and blacken the character of the servant   of The Most High God, by publishing abroad that the pro-  phet is enriching himself on the spoils of the brethren.   When brother Joseph stated to the general conference  the amount and situation of the property of the church,  of which he is trustee in trust by the united voice of the  church, he also stated the amount of his own possessions  on earth; and what do you think it was? We will tell   you. His old horse Charley, given him in Kirtland; two  pet deer; two old turkeys, and four young ones; the   old cow given him by a brother in Missouri, his old Ma-  jor, dog; his wife, children, and a little household furni-  ture; and this is the amount of the great possessions of that  man whom God has called to lead his people in these last  days; this the sum total of the great estates, the splendid   mansions and noble living of him who has spent a life of   toil and suffering, of privation and hardships, of impris-  onments and chains, of dungeons and vexations suits,   and every kind of contumely, and contempts ungodly  men could heap upon him, and last of all report him as   rolling in wealth and luxury which he had plundered   from the spoils of those for whose good he had thus toil-  ed and suffered. Who would be willing to suffer what  he has suffered, and labour near twenty years as he has  done, for the wealth he is in possession of?      Brethren, in view of all these things let us be up and   doing. Let those in the eastern States use all diligence  in communicating to us their ability to assist in the  Hotchkiss payment, being assured that no exertion they  can make, will equal what has already been made for  you and the church generally;and let all the saints come  up to the places of gathering, and with their mites and  their abundance, as God has given them in trust, help to   build up the old waste places, which have been thrown  down for many generations, knowing, that when they   are completed, they will belong unto the people of the   Most High God, even the meek, the honest in heart, he  shall possess all things in the due time of the Lord. Be  not covetous, but deal in righteousness, for what the  saints shall not possess by purchase and in righteous-  ness they shall not possess, for no unrighteous thing   can enter into the kingdom; therefore, beloved breth-  ren, deal justly, love mercy, walk humbly before God,  and whatever your hands find to do, do it with your   might, keeping all the commandments, and then, whether   in life or in death, all things will be yours, whether they  be temples or lands, houses or vineyards, baptisms or   enduements, revelations or healings, all things will be  yours, for you will be Christ's and Christ is God's.      BRIGHAM YOUNG,  HEBER C. KIMBALL,  ORSON PRATT,  LYMAN WIGHT,  JOHN TAYLOR,  WILFORD WOODRUFF,  GEO. A. SMITH,  WILLARD RICHARDS.  Nauvoo, Oct. 12th, 1841. 
 To the Bishops and Members of the Church of Jesus Christ  of Latter-day Saints, Residing in the various Settlements  throughout these Mountains:    BELOVED BRETHREN AND SISTERS:    The Temple at St. George, Washington County, Utah Territory, rapidly approaches  completion. Already some portions of it are in a condition to be used, and in a few weeks we  expect to be administering ordinances therein for the living and the dead. The General Con-  ference of the Church was adjourned on the 8th instant to hold its next session at 10 A.M.  on the 6th of April in the Temple at St. George. We hope the entire building will be com-  pleted by that time and that we shall be able to dedicate it to the Lord, our God. In the days  of our poverty, and while we had no Temple in which to administer ordinances for the dead  and to give endowments and to perform sealings and other ordinances for the living, the Lord  permitted us to erect an Endowment House in this city. This we have used for many years,  and many ordinances have been administered therein; but there are other important ordi-  nances which have not been, and cannot be, administered, except in a Temple built and dedi-  cated to the Most High for that purpose. Such a Temple we now have so far completed at St.  George that we can commence attending to these ordinances there. The mind of the Spirit to  us has been that we should, for the present at least, discontinue in the Endowment House in  this city the work of baptisms for the dead, of giving endowments and of sealing, and that,  hereafter, these ordinances should be performed in the Temple, or the Temples that shall be  built. This announcement we have made to the Saints. They have been profoundly moved  thereat. They are aroused to action. They now begin to appreciate how precious are the   opportunities they have had. Never before has there been such an anxiety displayed for the  privileges of the Endowment House. The prospect of it being closed causes the people to think  of their baptisms, endowments and sealings. They now perceive, as probably they never did  before, how convenient it would be to have a Temple completed in this part of the Territory.  This would save them the lengthy journey to and from St. George. The want of Temples at  other convenient points to which the Saints can repair to receive their ordinances will now be  felt at other places besides Salt Lake City. Especially will this be the case where persons wish  to marry. The Lord has taught us how important it is that our marriages should be solem-  nized according to the laws He has given, in holy places, where wives can be joined to hus-  bands for time and all eternity. What Latter-day Saint can be satisfied with any marriage  or authority less than this? Which of them, if he understands the laws of God, can feel  indifferent as to whether his wife shall be his for eternity or for time only; or whether his  children shall be born in the covenant and be legal heirs to the priesthood or have to become  such by adoption? It is for these and other ordinances that we are commanded of the Lord  to build Temples. We are now abundantly able to build them, and in them should the ordi-  nances be administered which have been acceptable only in the days of our poverty in other  places. At an holy altar in the Temple of the Lord can ordinances be administered to those  who are deemed worthy which they cannot receive elsewhere.    We feel led to say to the Latter-day Saints throughout these mountains: Let us  arise and build Temples unto our God at such places as He shall designate, into which we  and our children can enter and receive those blessings that He has in store for us. Let the  Bishops of the settlements in Washington, Kane, Iron, Pi-ute, Beaver, Millard, Sevier, San-  pete and Juab Counties call the people of their Wards together and ascertain from them how  much each one is willing to subscribe in labor and means, monthly, quarterly, or annual-  ly, towards the erection of a Temple at Manti, Sanpete County. Let the Bishops of the   Wards in Utah, Wasatch, Summit, Salt Lake, Tooele, Davis, Morgan, and Weber Counties call  the people of their Wards together and ascertain from them how much each one will donate  in labor and means, monthly, quarterly, or annually, towards the completion of the Temple in  this city. Let the Bishops of the various Wards in Box Elder, Cache and Rich Counties in  Utah Territory, and in the Counties of Bear Lake and Oneida in Idaho Territory, call public  meetings and learn from the people what each one is willing to do, monthly, quarterly or an-  nually, towards the erection of a Temple at Logan, Cache County. And at these meetings  the amount each person shall subscribe should be placed opposite his or her name, so that  what can be depended upon may be known in writing. Each Bishop can then make a state-  ment over his own signature to the President's Office of the amount of labor and means that  his Ward will furnish in the aggregate and that he will be responsible for.

 Elder W. Woodruff,    Beloved Brother, in the Kingdom of ^God^  I hope you will forgive me, for not writing to  you 'ear this. You know it is impossible for me to forg  it, you. Though I confess my negligence in writing; yet  all within me, bears witness, that Br Woodruff, has  been remembered. At the family alter, and before   the congregation, of the Saints, when ever the hour came  to offer our oblations to the Father, in the name of  Jesus, our Elder Brother.

I also viewed with much satisfaction the cource  persued by all my Brethren who went from this Land,  made dear to us by sacred covanants the Lord made  to Brother Joseph, our Martered Lawgiver and renowned  Prophet, that this Land should be our Everlasting  Inheritance.

 Monday Oct 14th. I had a good time yesterday through the day  peached twice. I walked with Sister Cobb from sister Voice to  meeting yesterday, was well in good spirits, was disappointed in not  having a letter from you. will write to you to day, all  was as well as could be expected at home. the Saints seemed  glad to see me in Boston. Millerism is now at its highest  pitch in Boston the last time is now set I think the 22nd of this  month they have made such fuss that their has been talk  of tearing down their Tabernacle but I hope the people will let  them alone. I addess the Chuch in this place in planness upon  the subject of politiks. Advised them to let it alone & not vote  or mingle with it, for I suppose that will be the case ^course^ taken  in Nauvoo.    As Ever I reman yous with respet & Essteem    W. Woodruff    P.S.

 In proposing the erection of new Temples, it is not expected that the work  now being done upon the Temple in this city by individuals and by the various quorums shall  cease. The labor upon the Temple here will continue to be pushed forward by those now en-  gaged in it until sites are selected for, and work shall be commenced by the different quorums  upon, other Temples. These Temples which we now propose to build will not be costly struc-  tures. They will be for Endowment purposes, and can be easily and quickly erected by the  people from whom the labor is required. You will perceive, by the anxiety of the Saints to  avail themselves of the privileges of the Endowment House in this city, and the manner in  which they are now crowding here, how necessary and desirable it is that these buildings  should be speedily completed, so that the facilities for sealing and the administration of other  ordinances should be placed within the reach of all who are worthy of them without their be-  ing compelled to travel to and from St. George to the Temple there. When the Saints were  required to build the Temple at Kirtland, Ohio, they were few in number and poor in means;  at Nauvoo also, when the Temple was erected there the Saints were not numerous, and their  circumstances, as contrasted with ours in these valleys, were those of great poverty. But in  rearing those Temples the people were greatly blessed. The Lord increased their substance,  provided ways of deliverance from their enemies, and bestowed gifts and knowledge upon them  which are beyond all earthly price. So it will be now, if we will arise in the majesty and  strength of our calling as the people of God, and build these Temples with willing hearts and   liberal hands, the Lord will pour out His blessings upon us to an extent we have never here-  tofore known. Our children will multiply and increase in faith, and though Satan may  rage, as he and his servants always do when the work of building Temples is being urged  forward, yet we will prosper and grow stronger and stronger until the redemption of Zion  shall be fully accomplished. Peace be with you, and Lord bless you.    Salt Lake City, U. T.,  25th October, 1876.    BRIGHAM YOUNG,   JOHN W. YOUNG,  DANIEL H.

 [sideways text] Rec'd May 18, 1888  ans'd [May] 21 —[1888]— [end of sideways text]    PRESIDENT'S OFFICE,  Salt Lake City, Utah, May 11, 1888.    President Joseph F. Smith,  Washington, D. C.    Dear Brother Joseph F.:    We have just sent you a dispatch concerning Brother  Franklin S. Richards. His help is needed here very much. We did not, however, wish to   ask him to return without consulting you, and shall be governed by your answer. It ap-  pears probable that every piece of property that the Receiver can by any possibility es-  tablish a shadow of claim for will be seized by him. Besides the gas and the street rail-  road stock, suit is entered for the part of the Tithing Office block sold by the Weber  Stake Association. Suits have also been entered for the house occupied by Brother L. W.  Shurtliff, and the Tabernacle square. There is a note given by Brother Shurtliff in fa-  vor of Richard J. Taylor, upon which there is still $2000.00 due, with interest. This  will doubtless be seized by the Receiver if he can get possession of it. We are informed  that he intends to attack the Daniel H. Wells lot, no doubt with the design to claim  that, and also the Council House corner and the old Constitution lot, and perhaps the  Museum. Parley L. Williams is familiar with our business through his former connection  with Le Grand Young and his general intimacy with our real estate transactions. The piece  of land sold by Alfales Young, which stands in Angus M. Cannon's name, has already been  sued for. Where this will end it is difficult to say; but we feel the need of more ef-  ficient help here. We are not strong in legal help, and our defence seems very feeble 
 considering the magnitude of the interest involved.    We have just received Alopeke's proposition which you  sent to us. We have it under consideration. It seems like a long time, however, to wait until  after the election before he enters heartily into the work. We shall advise you as to  our conclusions as quickly as possible.    As you will see by the papers, it has been decided to  dedicate the Manti Temple on the 21st. inst. We do not expect there will be so large a  gathering there as there was at Logan, because of the difficulty in reaching there,  there being 15 miles of travel after leaving the terminus of the railway. There will  doubtless be a heavy turnout from the Seveir and Sanpete Stakes and other parts of the   Temple District. We ^, the council,^ have decided to place the Temple in charge of Brother Daniel H. Wells,  and, if there shall be no objection, Brother Anton H. Lund will be his assistant. We  think that Brother Wells can attend to this with good assistance, and that he will enjoy  his labors. Of course, his health is not in a condition to admit of his doing very much  labor; but his past familiarity with temple ordinances will enable him to render effic-  ient service in directing affairs.    The "boom" does not excite the attention that it did  awhile ago. In fact, we suppose it is dying out. Still a great many n^a^ncicipate a revival  when the summer fairly opens and we have an influx of visitors. Up to the present, how-  ever, it has been considerable of a bubble, though some have realized large prices for  sales they have made.    Brother Erastus Snow has been very low, and for a time 
 his life was despaired of; in fact, it was freely said by the doctors that he would not   leave his room again alivi^e^. Those who administered to him, however, had a different faith;  still his condition remained very critical. Brothers Heber John Richards and Seymour B.  Young and a gentile doctor had tried to draw his water from him and had given it up or  concluded that there was none to draw. Afterwards Drs. Anderson and Benedict made him a  visit, and Dr. Benedict succeeded in drawing upwards of half a gallon from him, which  relieved him immensely, and under his skilful treatment Brother Snow has continued to  improve, and the prospect is that he may live for many years yet.    Of course, you will see by the papers the result of  the attempt of our brethren to affiliate with the Democratic party. Such treatment is   not very encouraging to our people. There are a great many worthless people connected   with the party, and in Ogden we are told that the Republican element is far superior to  the Democratic in respectability.    The weather at the present time is very pleasant. The  health of the people is good. We constantly remember you in our prayers and take deep  interest in all that you write to us. With love to yourself, to Brothes Richards, Pen-  rose, Caine, Campbell and Gibbs,    We remain,  Your Brethren,    Wilford Woodruff  Geo. Q.

Dear Brother Joseph F.:    Your esteemed favor of the 12th. inst. we received  upon our return from Manti, whither we went on the evening of the 13th. by special  train to Nephi and from Nephi by carriage to Manti. Our purpose in going to Manti  was to hold a private dedication of the Temple on the 17th. We reached there on Tues-  day morning about four o'clock, and were occupied in attending to business, making  preparations and in meetings until Thursday, when we met at ten o'clock and had a  prayer circle, and at twelve I -[President Woodruff]- read the dedication prayer, there  being twenty-nine persons present, including all the Apostles in the Territory except-  ing Brothers Erastus Snow, Moses Thatcher and John W. Taylor. We had a very delightful  season, and everyone enjoyed himself exceedingly. We remained there until Friday at  noon and then returned, leaving the brethren who could appear above ground to attend  to the public dedication. The Temple is beautifully finished and reflects great cred-  it upon all engaged in the labor of constructing it, and also those who furnished the  means. It is a cause of unbounded joy to think that the privilege has been granted to  us of completing another structure like this, in which the servants of God can enter  to attend to the ordinances for the living and the dead. Brother Daniel H. Wells has 
 OFFICE OF  The First Presidency  of the  Church of Jesus Christ  of  Latter-day Saints.    P. O. Box B.    Salt Lake City, Utah, June 25, 1897.    Presidency and High Council  of the Salt Lake Stake of Zion.    Dear Brethren:    It having been brought informally to the attention of the  First Presidency that a paper had been prepared by the High Council of  the Salt Lake Stake which Bros. George C. Lambert, B. M. Harmon and Geo.  M. Spencer were required to sign, and which paper Bro. Lambert, at   least, objected to sign for the reason that it would stultify him, it  was deemed prudent under the circumstances by the First Presidency to get  those of the Apostles who were convenient to join them in listening to  a printed document which had been circulated among the stockholders of  the South Jordan Canal Company by the three brethren above named; and to  listen to a paper which had been prepared by the High Council for these  three brethren to sign. Accordingly the First Presidency and President  Lorenzo Snow, F. D. Richards and John Henry Smith, of the Twelve Apostles  met at President Woodruff's Office on Monday, June 21st, and listened  patiently to the reading of these two documents. Before doing so,   however, there were verbal statements made to them concerning both   sides of the question involved so as to throw light upon the position  of affairs and the causes which led to the publication of this report by  an auditing committee consisting of the three brethren above named. It  appears from the printed document itself that this report which they  made was rejected at a meeting held for the purpose of hearing it, by 
 been appointed by the Council to preside, with Brother Anton H. Lund as his assistant,  and Brother M. F. Farnsworth as Recorder. Brothers J. D. T. McAllister, D. D. McArthur and  James G. Bleak came up from St. George to attend the dedication, and they will remain  to assist for a short time until everything is got into working order. The Temple  will pe opened for ordinances on the 28th. of May.    In my other letter to-day I expressed my feelings con-  cerning the return of Brother Richards and your visit to St. Louis to attend the Con-  vention. I need not therefore repeat in this letter respecting that matter. Whether  Brother John W. Young will attend or not we do not know. He would like to be appointed   to go there, but we have not said anything to him upon the subject. If he should go,  it will be because he desires to himself.    Upon receiving your dispatch for the umi tausani we  telegraphed you that elima tausani had been given to C. for the same purpose with  elima haneri for his private use. We thought it better to send you this information  that you might be fully aware of what was being done and be able to represent the  same to No. 3. We think you did well in putting the responsibilitu^y^ on them.    We hope that we shall get a good Chief Justice. We  have heard of Roger Sherman before. The Bowers concerning whom you write, me think,   must be Powers, who, we hear, is being favored by Don Dickinson. We sincerely trust  that he will never obtain another appointment to the bench or any other office in  our Territory; for he is a most dangerous man because of his want of principle. 
 Brother George Teasdale has been terribly exercised  over emigration matters, and his letters are full of descriptions of the anguish  which he has suffered in consequence of the attempt to change the route. He seems to  think that our attempt on this side to do business is a reflection on him, and that  we have not that confidence in him that we have had in others at the same place. I  hope you will write fully to him on this subject and keep him thoroughly advised, as   a good deal of the feeling that he has is due, we think, to misapprehension.    The health of Brother Erastur^s^ Snow is very precarious.  We visited him last night and administered to him; but the description that we got  from his wives of his condition and urine is really alarming. However, we exercise all  the faith we can, and shall struggle for him to be spared to us. The presence and la-  bors of such men are of exceeding value to us.    It seems that the Receiver is determined to get pos-  session of everything that ever belonged to the Church, and they are pursuing their  work with great vigor and an apparent determination to strip us of all they can.    We are having delightful weather at the present time,  and the health of the people generally is good. With love and praying the Lord to  bless you and preserve you from the hands of your enemies,    We remain, Your Brethren,    Wilford Woodruff  Geo. Q.

 the stockholders present and others who held proxies of the absent  stockholders. One of the views taken by the First Presidency and   Apostles was that the High Council in taking up this case had perhaps  transcended the bounds assigned it, as this was a case in which legal  questions were involved, the Canal Company being an incorporated company;   but this suggestion did not preevent the First Presidency and Apostles  from listiening to the documents. After hearing them and exchanging   views it was deeply regretted by all present that this rejected report  of the auditing committee ghad been put into print and circulated. Nothing  appeared before us, however, to invaldiate the truth of the report,   especially in view of the statement made: that those who were accused of   handling the funds improperly had since made arrangements for strainght-  ening out the accounts complained of by the committee; neithder did any-  thing appear before us as a reason why this report had been rejected by  the stockholders' meeting above referred to. It is reasonable to  suppose that as nothing appears making the correctness of the printed  report at all questioenable, the committee which made it based it upon  the fullest information at their command. Nothing appears, from all  that is known, that this report was a false report; and while we regret   its publication, ^because^ we think the stockholders might have been informed of   all the facts without putting them into print; but, while expressing   ourselves to this effect concerning the publication of this report, we  do not feel that the committee should be required to sign the paper that  has been prepared by the High Council for their signature. We would  ourselves shrink from signing such a paper under the circumstances; for   while it may be a fact that the reputation of some of the officers of  the canal company has been damaged by the printing of this report;  on the other hand, in correcting that wrong, if it be viewed as a   wrong, in the way proposed, we do not think it wise to create another

 wrong and injure the character of the committee by requiring them to  sign the paper that has been prepared. We think this would be injurious  to them, and two wrongs never did make a right.    Our view, therefore, is that this matter should be arranged  so as to correct whatever evil may have been done by the circulation of  this printed document, and at the same time not injure the men who  audited the books and who made the report from the books as they found  them. In making this statement we do so on the presumption that the   report of this auditing committee was a truthful report according to the  best information within their reach.

 VISIT MY WIFE'S FOLKS—GO FISHING IN THE SEA. 29    hold another meeting; but I felt anxious to continue my   journey, and on the 20th of July I parted with my father,   step-mother and sister, and took stage for Hartford with my   wife.    On my arrival at Hartford, not having money to pay the   fare of both of us, I paid my wife's fare to Rowley, Mass.,   where there was a branch of the Church, presided over by   Brother Nathaniel Holmes, father of Jonathan and Milton   Holmes, and I journeyed on foot.    I spent eight days at New Rowley, holding meetings and   visiting the Saints, including the Holmes family, and left   there on the 1st of August.    On the 8th of August, in company with my wife and Elder   Hale, I visited my wife's father, Ezra Carter, and his family  in Scarboro, Maine, it being the first time I had ever seen any   of her relatives. We were very kindly received. My wife   had been absent from her father's home about one year.    I spent eight days with Father Carter and household, and   one day I went out to sea with Fabian and Ezra Carter, my   brothers-in-law, in a boat, to fish with hooks. We caught  250 cod, haddock and hake, and we saw four whales, two at a   time, it being the first time in my life I had ever seen the  kind of a fish which is said to have swallowed Jonah.    On the 18th of August, 1837, I parted with my wife and her  father's household, leaving her with them, and, in company   with Jonathan H. Hale, started upon the mission that I had in  view when I left Kirtland.    We walked ten miles to Portland, and took passage on the  steamboat Bangor, which carried us to Owl's Head, where we   went on board of a sloop which landed us on North Fox Island  at 2 o'clock, a. m., on the 20th. 
 Kirtland Sunday 9th Sept, 1838    Mr. Woodruff    [illegible]    Yours of Aug. 3rd has  been Recd & I now proceed to answer it   which I should have cheerfully done  some two weeks earlyer than this,   had not our intelligence from Mo.   concerning Mormon matters been of such  an interesting nature, that I thought  it worth while to delay, in hopes that   something of a decisive character might  be obtained respecting the great excitement   that prevails in upper Mo. on account  of some recent measures that have been  taken in that vicinity not only among  the Mormons, but among the citizens also.    We have been authentically informed by  information from various sources that   there has been a fight in Davis Co. Mo.   between the citizens & Saints & that the  latter were the first aggressors, that  it was at a ^state^ Election, held on the 6th Aug.   that none were killed but a number were  wounded, -- that J. Smith Jr. & some  other leading men, followed by about  120 desiples well armed surrounded the  house of a Magistrate & compelled him  on paine of death to sign a writing the   [[purport of which he did not know   neither have we as yet been able to   asertain; that about 500 Mormons were  organized & well armed, who were going  through the county to force every man  to sign said writing. That Smith is  teaching them, that Mohammed sust-   ained & propogtated his religion by the sword  & that he can his, that Mohammed was   a true prophet &c. 
 Manchester Jany 28, 1840    Beloved bro Richards,    I recieved yours of the 25th on Sunday together  with one from sister Clayton. I am informed that my family is tolerably  well for which I roejoice.    I had intended to answer your letter yesterday but I concluded to wait.  I thank you for the council contained in your last.    Have not said any thing to the council concerning bro Arthurs case, but I think  I shall have to do it yet. He seems to grow worse, last night bro Green proposed  at his meeting a subs-cription to be entered into for Sarhah Duckwortah, a few shillings  was collected. at the close of the meeting arthur stepped forward and said he would  have nothing to do with it. The box he said was put in the room for those  things and if they would break the order &c. they might take it into their own hands  I thought it best not to notice him then, & went out to supper. when I returned again  I found him railing amongst them &c. I told him that was not the place to complain  of such things, we would hear it at the council friday eve &c. he shewed a very bad  spirit—he is not one with us, but I want to be just & merciful. If you have  any thing more on this subject it will be thankfully recieved before the council  Have not yet took his licence.    Feel sorry to learn that there is something unpleasant at [P] again.    To your questions, I give council at your request according to the measure of the  spirit & wisdom which God hath given me—If I err, Tis but me.  To the first— "If a sister letts evil reports &c" & having been visited according to order  by Elders yet will give no satisfaction either to them or the church" I feel to say  I dont see how those Elders can be justified in not bringing the case before the  council at least. I should say if they would not, they will be guilty of unfaithfulness &c  2nd The partys desiring the case to be put off—2 or more wks—when a case of transgression  is clearly proved against them. They ought to be suspended from fellowship—  untill satisfaction is made to the church.    3rd I should say it is not the privilege of any member who is known to be under  transgression to partake of the sacrement untill satisfaction is made. And if an  officer administers sacrement to such knowing the case &c. ought he himself not to [be]  brought before the council.    4—If my wife was under transgression &c. I dare not plead her off—no more than any other member 
 such would be the council I should give, from the idea I have of the statement.  You desire to hear something about Burslem & I am happy to say I received a  letter on friday—the substance of which I will lay before you.    "We had a cold windy ride and got to B about 1/2 p[as]t 9 [oweighs] was conducted to Elder  Cordons by a sister—was much pleased with my interview with the Saints—find  bro Cordon very faithful & all the official members so far as I know.  They have baptised 22 sinse W. C left on the 23 December. Total baptised in the potteries  66. Total confirmed 58. last week, (2 wk to night) their opposers flung the candles  and candlesticks at their heads but notwithstanding one came to be baptised  Bro Alfred baptised a Gentleman & Lady—on sunday morning and their servant  a few days before. They keep a provision wharehouse in Hanley. We are again  trying to get a door opened at Hanley. Do not know how much more warning the  people will have in the potteries, neither do I know how long I shall tarry here. I feel  as though the spirit will soon send one of us to Birmingham, can tell better in a  few days. Love &c—Elder Turley—love—had quite a sore throat the day after  their arrival. Yours &c. Willford Woodruff    This A.M. have recieved a letter from bro Taylor—tis quite a lengthy epistle—  commences with love & blessing, after refers to the state in which he finds things in  England, he refers to the sufferings of the Saints in America. Then states thus  on Sunday morning they went to Aitkins Chapel & after the preaching bro Taylor  asked permission to speak a little—they answered he had better speak to the leaders  in the vestry. After meeting they retired into the vestry—They asked what sect he  belonged to &c. He then gave his testimony &c in plain mild language & asked  permission to preach in their chapel &c. They told him they has not authority  to permit him &c. Many seemed affected. He stated they would hold a meeting  last [eve] in [owe] of Aitkins preachers hereses. I suppose they have wrote you  I have also got 2 letters from Bedford. bro Lavender writes as follows  "B. Jany 25—D[ea]r brethren, my soul is grieved very much from what I hear about James  Lea. Mr Rawlins has given me a letter written by a gentleman at Liecester  who appears to have been a friend to Lea it reads as following. Sir I have read over  a little of Lea's proceedings. he left Leicester with not less than from 30 to 40 soveriens of your  money. when he went to pay Simpson his last rent he declared he saw as much as I  have stated. Limpson [Simpson] said while Lea was ill he pleaded so much poverty & distress that  he thought he had not one halfpenny to help himself. So I sent him several dinners  and a bottle of wine thinking it was a deed of charity. Simpson said Lea on one  occasion when taking his purse from his pocket, took out a handful of sovereins  to the amount stated and said, Simpson I have a great many enemies in this place  and I will leave it this day and I do not care a dam not a buggars for its vary  name of the lot for I have plenty of money to carry me out of Leicester. Yours &c  I find D[ea]r brethren this is a task for me. Lea was a servant to Mr Rawlins 
 also that "one can chase a 1000 & two   [[illegible 10,000 to flight" & that in case of   necessity God will send down legions  of angels to their assistance. An old  gentleman in this place of respectability  has just returned from a visit at Far-  West Mo. who is a member of the church   & has been almost from it commensment  who was a man of property, & took Smith  & Rigdon into his own house, in the  early part of their Mormon career &  treated them with all the tenderness of   a brother, or even a parent, when they ^(the mormons)^ were   but a handful in number, & despised  & hated, he has lent his name with their  them in their speculations, to his name.    When on the visit alluded to they made   further demands upon him, which he  refused to comply with, for which he was   mobed & his life threatened, by the emiss[ar]y  of Smith & Rigdon & was obliged to flee for   his life. Smith boasts of having at his   command as good, an inquisition as  any pope ever had. Secret measures   were adopted, before Smith left this place  to destroy the inhabitants of Jackson Co.   to my certain knowledge, if the confessions  of those who were among the chosen band  to accomplish it, are to be credited. A man  formarly one of the 12 apostles of the latter days,   son of the old gentleman spoken of above  was compelled to flee from Zion, this season  because he took exceptions to their procedings  & hardly escaped with his life, was fired at  13 times before he had rode a mile from  the city, by men in disguise, some of   whom he knew, ^notwithstanding^ to be men in high stand-  ing in the Church; Rigdon in a public  discourse,(backed up by Smith,) said that  dissenters were like salt that had lost 
 it savour, good for nothing but to be cast  out & troden under feet of men, & little the   hand, or eye that had offended; that   these saying were to be litterally fufilled  upon dissenters by the saints, that they (dissen-  ters) were not fit to live, that God always  make use of his servants, as his ministers  of destruction, that when Ananias & Saphina  fell down dead, at the apostles feet, that   it was, because the apostle killed them  that in the New Testament the story is not  all told in relation to such circumstances  but they obtain, it by revelations direct from  heaven. Also that Peter Killed Judas, or  followed him out into the field, & while he  was filled with grief, Knocked him down  & his bowels gushed out, &c. On about the   10th. Aug. a state warrent was issued, by  the circuit Judge, in Ray Co. for Smith, &  Wight, the leaders of the insurriction alluded   to above, the [[illegible result, we are waiting  with deep anxiety to asertain, what course  he will take, I am at a loss to determine,  I think he will fight, I understand he   says he will resist unto death, & hundreds  of his delude followers, are sworn to defend  him under any circumstances, wright  or wrong. Publick meetings, & measures  have been, called & adopted in several   of those adjoining counties. What the end  will be is for futurity to disclose, I fear the  inocent will suffer with, the guilty, I hope  not. -- these, & many things of a like nature  which, have been developed within two years  past which the narrow limits of a sheet [[illegible  are insertion, "I think, will answer your inqu-  iry, to my unbelief in "The clean character  of Smiths ministry"    With sentiments of Respect    I am Sir your obt.

 he expected Lea to give a proper account of what he had left him in charge wihth  that at his coming he might recieve his own with usury. I feel I am not my own  I am bought with a price even the blood of Jesus Christ, and as a servant I must  soon give up my accounts. I desire & strive brethren to keep my accounts right  with the Lord every day that I may meet him with joy. Lea could get away from his  master but I feel always in the presense of mine & my desire is to live nearer  still that I may be ready at any hour to give up my accounts. Last sabbath was  a day for fasting & prayer with us. The Lord gave us a spirit to pray for bro & sis Lea  and we hope after all they will repent like Peter. I think it will be the means of doing  us good & makeing us watchful. The brethren & sisters appear to be doing well at this  time and are looking out almost every day for one of the Elders who have come from  America or our father Richards. We are but few & very poor yet we hope to see them soon  if the Lord will. I find in the book of Doc & Cov that when a bro or sis breaks the laws  of the land we are to deliver them up to the same. Mr Rawlins has been to me this  day to know where Lea is and what he is doing and how he can write to him. I said  I knew he was at Manchester a little time ago but I know nothing of him now. I sasid I  will write down to know where he is and will call upon you in a feew days. So I  depend upon you for this information by return of post that I may fulfil my promise  I will enclose a letter written or posted by Lea on the 4 Dec last to show you how a  man can act out of sight (yes a priest in the church of Christ) remember this his  conduct at Leicester and the other his writing to me nearly at the same time had I not  seen the accounts & letters & insolent notes that he sent to Mr Rawlins I could not have  believed it but it is so plain I am compelled to believe it. Be pleased to tell bro & sis  Lea I hope they will set at once and macke up the breach Love &c    Here follows an extract from the letter sent by bro Lea to Mr Rawlins Lavender  D[ea]r brethren & sisters in Christ—have many times rejoiced with you at Bedford &c  but since that time I have many times ben led to ask myself what am I doing  here doing the Devils work when called to labour in the Lord's vineyard with the  servants of the Lord. I have many times de[a]r bro as you wrote to me about drinking  asmoking, singing & swearing & said if I was but out of this and enjoying myself  with my D[ea]r brethren & sisters singing the praises of God. After stating his grief  on account of his present situation & epxpresing a hope of deliverance—he says I hope  this has learned me a lesson not to give ear to man again knowing that the  heart of man is decietful above all things & that the tender mercies of the  wicked are cruel. When I look at what I am brought to by giving bear to wicked  men I take it as the judgement of God upon me. I know that I have sinned  against my heavenly Father & I feel along way from heaven but I hope the Lord  will bring me back again. after adverting to the wicked state of the world &  their unpleasant situation & again expressing a hope that they will soon  be delivered he concludes—Lov &c—    This is substance of the enclosed letter— 
 I have not time to look it over &c but I intend to give you a copy  of the whole letter when I here from you again if you require it  I intend writing to bro Taylor & Fielding this P. M. & shall give him  the whole statement—if you have any council send soon [as] you can    [written in upside-down text] send me word if you have heard or wrote  to Liverpool [end of upside-down text]    I shall expect a letter from you in a day or two, about the Elders  Wife who she is &c—how bro [Evers] got along &c, & all other news of  importance—bro Clark is not returned from [Peoun]—I believe Jno  Wytch is married to day 2 baptized on Sunday—2 tomorrow several  more ready—my time is gone—my love to all Forever  Clayton    [written in sideways text] Mr. Willard Richards  New house opposite No 3 Meadow St    Top of Park Road  Preston  Lancashire    Speed    [stamp in red ink] MANCHESTER  Jan 28, 1840 [end of sideways text]    [written in upside-down text] answered  Jany. 29, 0040 [1840]

 Philadelphia P.a. Dec 3rd 1844    President B. Young    Beloved Brother    Impressed with a deep  sens of Duty toward God, toward you, & the quorum of Twelve  & the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, I cannot  leave the shores of America without unbosoming my feelings to  you more fully than I have hitherto done; their has been a fire  in my bosom that I have tried to smother in my communications  to you concerning affairs in the Eastern Churches. I have done it fearing  that you might think me an accusor of my bretheren, & that I should bring  difficulty upon myself; but when I see an influence carrying Death in all  its march instead of life, yea death like the upas tree, knowing the vary  vitals of the Twelve & the Church, Laying the foundation of our cause, shall  I hold my peace, No God forbid. It is true I spoke plain in my former  letters but I ^feel to^ speak tplainer still. Their has been a time since the death of Joseph  & Hiram & still is when we want men in the vy vineyard that are men of God  that will act wisely, build the kindom, strengthen the weak, Deal with mildness  act in concert with the Council in Nauvoo, & not acknowledge the head to  be whare it is, But I must say that I do not believe Elders Wm Smith  & G. J. Adams to be such men. I believe their whole influence has gone  throughout the Eastern Churches to gratify their own propensities, rob the  Churches for themselves, set themselves up as great men, to gain an influence  unto themselves, crushed evry man that would not assist them to accomplish  their end, ordain High priest & Exhalt men that would go with them  & tried to the fulest Extent to have the power of the eastern Churches in the  hands of men that would give them the influence. I have some reason  to believe they have spent hundreds of Dollars of Temple money for their  own use, & I believe the prophet in New York has been an Engine in  their hands to accomplish the same End. The Churches they have visited  the most are the worst of, & the Rigdon party have got more out of  such Churches than any where els. A principle that they call the spiritual  wife Doctrin is so instilled into the minds of most of the Elders whare  they have been, that if any one says any thing against prattizing or preaching

 if they think he is an old granny, & weak in the faith, & who  dont know that such an order of things will Explode any society  to the four winds of Heaven. I have been in the midst of a number  of fires in this Eastern Land. I have had to contend against Rigdon  & his party on the one hand, & stretch out my hand on the other side  with the greatest wisdom I could get to try to save the Church & the Elders  from that that vortex of Recklessness unto which they seemed to be  plunging through the influence of Wm & Adams. And all these  things the quorum of the Twelve have to hear. I feel bad about  the eastern Churches they are not out of Danger, the New York  Church is in a bad situation, & to cop the climax Wm wrote  a peace accusing Winchester of having a hand in murdering his brothers, & he  has got out warrants for him, are about to take Brannan for printing it  & have taken ^Elder^ Grant for selling the papers & he has been hand over to  appear at court under $1000 dollars bond, & Adams has taken Winchester  for Slander & all these cases will come up & be investigated to the  fulest Extent the character of Joseph & Hiram & the Twelve will be mad[e]  as black through falshood as the Lawyers can make them & all Hell is  raked over to ge testimony against the Twelve, & others Esspecially Wm Smith  & Adams, & any imprudence that those men have to been been guilty  of or any one els the Twelve have to learn it.  Wm &  Adams at  times talk much about sustaining the Twelve but I think it ^is^ for  Effect more than any thing els. Wm Smith told Elder Grant that  the Twelve had not sustained him nor had he risen through their  influence but on his own, neither should be ^fool himself bound hereafter to defend the character^ sustains ^of^ the Twelve or be  ^Br Grant thinks he was some excited when he made these remarks^ accountable to that quorum but he was led by visions & revelations  for himself & he said he & Adams was sworn friends & that Adams  existance depended upon his. Wm has tried to gain an influence by saying  that he was the last of the Smith family left that had land the foundation  of the Church &c. But by careful observations I can see things crouding  out that is leading to Apostacy & acting against our interest, God knows  I dont want to Injure Br Smith nor Br Adams for the sake of the Smith  family I went Wm said it possible But I know that you ought to  be apprised of things as they are, & this is the reason why I thus write.  I Beg of you president Young If you want to save the Eastern  Churches to delagate some one of the Twelve from Nauvoo that will  act with you to come & take charge of them for awhile, or some    [sideways text] you will understand I do not write this course as prefering charges before ^the Twelve against^ Adams & Wm Smith for a trial but merely that you may understand the true state of things [end of sideways text]

 June 16 Dear Wilford  I have come down to sister Smith before I milk my cow  lest her letter should be gone to the office to tell you that we are all comfortably well  at present  the  we have all had very bad colds[.] Susan & Phebe have been quite sick  Sister Eunice health is a little better. I received 5 dolls from you from Newark bought about   4 dolls worth of lumber paid balis one & now brother Webster is at work on the house  the other front room and will go to keeping house by themselves when it is done, we have   not yet got the flooring. O you do not know how much you are wanted to see about   things here, Sister Smith says tell him to come home when Mr. Smith comes, I sup-  pose she has written all the news[.] there is much talk of a mob here but I have not had   the first anxious thought about it yet[.] the authorities here demolished the press precisely  according to law so they have left us (the law party) they tried to land in Madison when  the left here but the inhabitants would  not  have them there so they went father on up the river  they tried to get some printing done but the editors there told them that they would not   do it for their press was in good repute now. Joseph has had a dream about the the Laws  he thought they bound him and cast him and into a pit (or well like Joseph of old[)] but he   made a struggle and got to the top of the well so to look out and he saw a little distance  from him one of them in the graspe of a tiger the other a snake and they were calling to   him to help them he told them they had tied him and he could not help them a brother soon  came along and took brother Joseph out. Our garden does very well[.] brother A   Alexander is not going out this season. brother Taylor is waiting for Joseph to   say go to him, but there is much excitement here at present and he thinks he had   better wait. A messenger has been sent to the governor has gone now I want to see  you much but had quite as lives you would be away now untill this fuss is over. I   received 2 letters from home by Arthur Milliken saying that Luther would not come untill  Sept. and I think sister Foss not at all I cannot say much to her on mothers account   as she tells me she thinks mother would die almost or quite if she should leave. If you go to Maine I want you to buy 2 yds dark brown ribbon 1 inch 1/4 wide and give to mother  for me with a kiss and tell her she has not got a child in the world that loves her better  or will do more for her than her wandering Phebe. give my love to them all and   acept much love yourself P.

I have been  very busy in building me a house ◊nd in   preaching the gospel. Away from home I seldom  could find a decent pen, or a half sheet of clean  paper.

 man besides Wm or Adams. Elder Grant tells me that Wm  is about to visit the Churches again through the East & New Hampshire  &c. I saw a letter from him stating that He had Authorized  Elders to collect for money for him to assist him in his Lawsuits  I also beg of you not to send Elder Adams into the Eastern  Churches or any where els untill he can learn thereat their is Authority  in this Church unto whome he is amemiable & has got some Authority & as well as himself  for I believe him to be reckless & do not believe he regards any  authority in this Church when he is out of the presence of the quorum  of the Twelve. He is such a great Apostle to the gentiles that he is head  & sholdiers above all others. In those Churches whare they have held sway  I could get but little or no assistance to help us on our mission  If I could have borrowed the money I would not have asked for  a dollar when I arrived in New York. we had ownly means enough to  secure our passage but nothing to get provisions with & the N. York  church raised us $2.50 two dollars & fifty cents to help us but they  could help other men I ownly spent the sabbath with them, came  to Philadelphia to hold one meeting with Elder Grant. I found him  just right, with us with all his heart. & notwithstanding the former  difficulthes the philadelphia Church is in the best order or as good as any  man one East of the mountains that Adams & Wm has visited, & it is  in a better state than ever has been since Winchester fraction. Elder  Grant is a man after my own heart he is true in all things. his spirit is not  congenal with Adams & Wm but goes with Brigham & the Twelve.  Has Elder Smith sent up the $150 for the Temple from the Peterboro Church, & money he  has collected from all the Eastern Churches, $20 or $25 from Vinson Shirtliff of  Westfield. Elder Grant asked me if he should leave for Washington, or anywhere  els, I think he has saved the Church in philadelphia I advised him to remind a  little untill the difficulties are a little more over. give him council as you  see fit, he will go whare you say. Beloved Brother I must close. I have written  what I believe, keep an eye upon Br. Wm & Adams. When I get to England if men  fight  Joseph & Hiram, that are dead, the Twelve that are living sustain Rigdon & his  party, introduce & practice the spiritual wife doctrin, for either of these if they dont  repent I will cut them off. I will go with you, give me such council as you think  best. I will follow it. If I am doing wrong in any thing tell me of it I will repent  of it & leave it. (please take care of this letter let it not hurt me) my respects to   the quorum & all who inquire. Yours in the Love of God    W.    Elder. Young. the statements of Br. Woodruff, I verily believe are  Just and true, & some of them, I know are true to the letter.  my views agree with his, in all things, Yours &c    J M. Grant.

 Snow at Springtown is about 18 Inches deep and  at this place about 6, and only 6 miles apart. We have  had a beautifully mild season until Wednesday last where  the snow fell very freely and it became intensly cold. We have  no wind storms to do us any serious damage in the county  with the exception of about one third of the roof of the meeting  house at ◊Fort Ephraim which was blown off by reason  of a door being left open and the house being tight, it had  to burst. But it is all repaired. I regret the losses sustained  by our Brethren in the North, yet I am thankful that no  human lives were lost.

 P.S. I perceive by the news that Bro Gardner Snow of  Manti City is elected Probate Judge for this County. He is  a very good man; but is completely wraped up in his son  Warren and in George Peacock. The people of Sanpete  have paid Taxes now for many years, and no improvements  can be seen but the jail half finished by Bishop Snow. It  is like all improvements in Manti, unfinished. Several  Back houses have been begun, but I Know not one finished  The jail [in?] like condition. $4.500 was the contract price  for completeing it, as I am told, when $2.000 would build and  complete a much better building than that would be if finished  The county is greatly in debt and no improvements that are  of much or any use at all. The tithing office has suffered,  the county has suffered, the Perpetual Fund has suffered  The people have suffered by their ◊t◊◊◊◊ being made into  st◊◊ys and then into beef. [The?] Indian [department?] has  suffered, Missionaries have suffered by their donations going  in the same way. The people of Sanpete think the  B◊◊◊bows have reigned long enough, and that B◊◊◊◊◊◊  Dynasty should end. If the county seat were removed  [from?] Manti to Moroni or to Springtown it would   suit the notions of the people much better. If to Moroni  M. D Hamilton should be Probate Judge, if to Springtown,   Redick Allred should be appointed the Judge, I have  expressed no opinion here as to the removal of the county   seat, neither any with regard to the [choice?] of a Judge◊.  yet the above are my true sentiments and 19 t◊◊◊teths  of the people here would endorse them, the opinion,  of our representati◊◊ to the [contrary?] notwithstanding

 St. George Jan 22, 1877    Dear Emma,    I received your good letter and Nellies  next morning after I sent my last in which I spoke of the  Death of Sister Martha Smoot. I wrote next dy to Broth  & Sister Smoot at provo. I thank you for your  kind feeling towards me. I prize the love of my family  and wish to do what I can to make them comfortable  but being called of God and the presidt of the Church  to officiate in the spiritual things of the Kingdom it  of course deprives me of takeing all the time for my  family and spending my time with them. But I am  satisfied that my mission to St George this winter will be  of much benefit to me in many Respects. I was so worn  down when I left home that I needed Rest, and the Blessing  one may that I had received since I had ben here, the  following are some of them. I had had the privilege of Dedicating  the Temple on the lower portion of it unto the Lord. I have had  the privilege of doing the first Baptzing, confirming ordaining  giving the 2nd Anointings in the temple and have organized the  working company, and am presiding over the Temple at in the  labor therof. I have been an instrument in the hands of the   Lord in Revolutionizing the moral spirit of the City of St  George when I came here there had not been but one Prayer  Meeting, attended in the City for a year the was one a week, at 
 February 1, 1877    To Asahel, Clara, Owen, Blanche, and Alice, My beloved children:    You have again the privilege of enjoying the society of your mother, and  I am thankful for this. I want to give you all a word of council considering  the signs of the times, the persecutive of our nation against us and at my  own age you cannot reasonably expect to enjoy much more of my society as your  father in this life, but you have with you your mother.    Now if it was the last testimony I was to give you on earth I want to   say be kind to your mother. You cannot always expect to have her with you,  altho she may live a score of years or more, time will be short. Do not give  way to anger, or say or do anything that you will be sorry for but I pray you  be united with your mother and with each other and look after each others   interest.    Again I wish to say to you by children, thatIknow that God lives, that  Jesus Christ is the Son of God and the Savior of the world, and he shed his  blood to redeem us from death, and God raised up Joseph Smith as a true pro-  phet of God, who brought forth the Book of Mormon, and laid the foundation  of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the only true and living  church upon the face of the whole earth with which the Lord is well pleased.  And the Church of Christ, and the Zion and Kingdom of God has been organized.    It is on the earth for the last time, and this church and Kingdom of God  will stand and fill the whole earth and be thrown down no more forever.   Now you all hold this Church and Kingdom of God on earth, and I want you all   to pursue a course, so as to never be separated from the Church in time or  Eternity, and as your father has been called to the apostleship which office  I have held near 49 years and have also been called to stand as the President 
 with aboutt 2000 people inside I offerd the first  dedication prays didicating all the lower part of the  Temple, Erastus Snow, the room also and  B Young Jr the Sealing room President Young was  so lame in his feet that He had to be carried   in a chair By 3 men all through the house  but at last before we closed the power of God  came upon him He arose from his chair  walked unto the stand and spoke 30 Minuts in  the power of God in the last sentence He uttered  he struck the lowar stand with his hickory cane  full of knots that sunk the knots into the solid wood  so deep that they will remain there for a generation  if their holes are not filled up. I have sent to the  Editor of the News this day, all the procedings of the  day, the prayes, speeches &c but when you read the  speech of president Young, you will never learn  by that all that He said for we could not publish  it. the services occupied 3 Hours. I expect what I  have sent will come out in the News. We com-  mence Baptizing for the dead on Tuesday and  Wednesday, and give Endowments tOn Thursday and  friday president Young wanted to Baptize the  feet in the font. If he does not I expect it will 
 St George Temple Feb 10. 1877    Dear Emma    I am getting quite Anxious to know  what is the matter with you, and the family that I   can hear nothing from any of you now for about  three weeks I watch the mails carefully but no  letter come, I wrote you a laong family letter in  answer to your last Jan 12 making one month into 2  2 days, I answered it Jan 25 which is ownly two weeks  since I wrote that letter, but I feel anxius to know if  you recieved ^it^ for I do not want such letters to fall  into the hands of ocrthers I wrote you another letter  a week ago.

 of the Twelve Apostles, now as an apostle, and as your father, I have a right  to council you and give you advice.    There is one particular thing I want to impress upon your minds, and that  is study the revelations of God and have faith in them, the Bible, Book of   Mormon, and Doctrine and Covenants, and I want you all to begin in your youth  to make your wants known to the Lord in prayer, ask him for what you want,   not as a ceremony, but in faith, and he will hear you and answer your prayers.    Now my children, harken to these sayings and put them into practice.  The revelations of God are true and will be fulfilled. I want you all to  be saved and to be with me on the morning of the First Resurrection to dwell  with me forever with God and the Lamb.    This is the Prayer of your loving father.

 St George Temple June 7, 1877    Dear Emma    I Received the letters of Nellie  and Asahels of May 28, also your  Note I read over your Note near  ten times before I could understand  it. I did not know that it was the  outside of an envelope that I had sent  to you.

 could not Breath while lying down  I was holstered up in a chair abot  half of the time I took evry kind of   Medicine that was recommended for the  Lung desease, including Lobelia [Emetets]  and vapor baths but Nothing seemed   to reach the foundation of my desease  but on the 16 it gave way all of a sudden  without any outward known cause and  on the 17 the first day that I had steped  out of Doors for some 10 days I rode to the  Temple and walked in a few moments  and have been getting better ever since  but am still weak but I trust it   will not be long untill I will again  be laboring in the Temple.

I want to have you  take care of this letter, & not let it do me any but for what  I have said looks as though I was boasting, but I do not  feel to boast without it is in the Lord, for all that I have He  giveth me, and I feel to acknowledge his hand in it. Remember  me kindly to Azmon & Elizabeth Br & Sister Hulse John & Sarah Richie  and all enquiring friends I was very glad to learn that Blanch   was better. The last I heard from Sarah she had been quite  sick and when she wrote ownly able to set up a little and  Sylvia quite sick with the dipthera Ma said Bulah  Baby was quite sick with cold on the Lungs But I hope  there will not any of our family die while I am gone  I wish I could spend some of my learne time with you,  and the children But I expect I will have to wait untill  spring. We have called Sister Church into the Temple to work to  assist in washing and Anointing the Sisters. I want to write a little to  the children for they will think hard of it if I do not you must  try to comfort William Smoot and his family what you can I  know it is a hard Blow to them. That Health, Strength, peace,  power and the Blessings of God may rest upon you and your children is  the daily prayer of Your Husband & Companion W Woodruff

 As to Mary All Alice that Blessed Baby of course that   belongs to Ma and we will leave that for her to take care  of it is rather strange that she does not cry for her father  I think it is best for the childran to stay at home during  bad weather, it is better tohan to get sick. I think it was   well for sister Pearl not to come from a sick family  to the House. I gave your Love to Sister Church I am   still laborig in the Temple and getting some of my   work done Every day, I went to the stone quiry  with Brothe Teasdale, I borrowed a gun & shot 7  quails which made us a good Meal. I am glad   Asahel is doing so well I feel quite incouraged  abut him I am glad he has got into Business He has   a good chance now to make for himself a good  character, and I hope he will improve it but as   I want to write a little to children I will close   Praying the Lord to Bless you with health, strength  and peace and the spirit of God I remain yours    W Woodruff    Dear Blanch, you are my girl, and I want to   have you a good girl, I expect to see you almost a   young woman when I come home, I want you   to mind Ma help take care of the Baby and learn   to pray night & Morning, for I your Father Pray for   you daily in the great white Tem[ple] of St George   I am your Loving Father    Wilford Woodruff 
 [S]t George Temple Jan 31, 1879    My Dear Emma    Do you know I hardly Ever had  a letter that done me more good than the one I got  to Night at 8 oclok from you for I was so anxious  to hear from home. I wrote you and all the family  on the 24, which you will gat all safe I trust. I told   Asahel about my Deer hunt. But I was so gratified   to hear that you and the family were well during  this Terrible time of sickness. I could not bear the  thought that my children should die and be buried  as some families are. I feel deeply sorry for  Brothe & Sister Mousley. It seames impossible to im-  part consolatio to such. Bring it home to our own care  what if we had to bury Nelly, Asahel, Clary, Owen  & Blanch, who could give us consolation it is enough  to make one weep at the thought. I feel to thank the Lord  that our family are so far preserved and that I  have the prospect of seeing them in the flesh when   I return home. I know Blanch is my girl. But  I would like to know who Nelly, Asahel Clary & Owen  Belongs to I think I have some claim on them if I have  not, I like to know who has, if any body was to tell me   I had not they would get themselves into difficulty

It restrained my legs  & vitals ^so^ that my  Urin turned to Blood, it left me vary  weak. My friends done all they could for me, stood  By me day and night But through the Mercy of God my   life was again spared for a little season longer. But I did   not know but my work was finished But I did not   really want to die quite so far away from my family  On the 3rd day after my attack I was able with the help  of two men to walk some 4 rods into a larger tent and   in two days more I was Enable to walk with a staff  alone A carriage had arived to take me 125 Miles asto another

 [sideways text]  Letter April 13, 1861  W. M. Gibson To W. Woodruff  about a newspaper  article.  Rev May 3 1861  file in our pigeon hole   [end of sideways text]    Sacramento, Cal. April 13 1861    Dear Brother Woodruff    I mail to day a letter  to Pres. Young, under cover to br. Clawson.   It is in accordance with my design, when   I set out, to limit my correspondence with   the city to br. Young; and indeed my oppor-  tunities will not permit me to extend it; —  therefore, dear brother, I do not sit down to   write you a letter; — not doubting but that   you will be informed of the contents of the   one addressed to the office; but to enclose   a newspaper slip, which came to my hand   after mailing the above letter. The article   "Brigham Young, and Louis Napoleon — a parallel,"  is a mere squib; and apparently hardly de-  serving of attention; but it has some little 
 significance to my mind, which may not be  uninteresting to mention. In my frequent dis-  cussions with the editors of this journal; and  other editors of San Francisco, concerning the   political condition of the country; I have   had occasion to point out the "Chief of   Utah," sometimes in a jocular, sometimes in   an earnest manner, as the mood of the com-  pany would permit, as the only man showing  capacity to ride on the whirlwind of revolution,   and still the political storm. And I have   listened to frequent recognitions on the part  of thinking individuals, that he was the   "only man for the times." This little newspa-  per article, is the utterance of an editor, be-  lieving more fully in the mission of sove-  reignty of Brigham Young, than he dare  express. You may expect startling revo-  lutions in public opinions in California.  Do not consider this a letter; but a postscript  to Pres. Young's. Your bro. in the Gospel. W. M. Gibson
