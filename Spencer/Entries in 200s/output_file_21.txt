Dear Sir:  The Irrigation Congress, which is to meet in Salt Lake City, on September 15th, 16th, and 17th, 1891, ais attracting wide-spread interest and promises to be very largely attended by representative people from all of the western states and many others from the east. In order that strangers in the city at that time, may be given a proper idea of Salt Lake City and her people, the General Committee of Arrangements has thought  that there would be no better way of accomplishing that result and at the same time, affording our visitors an enjoyable event, than to have the Choral Society and other musical organizations of the city, give a grand Musical Festival, in the great tTabernacle, on the noight of Thursday, September 17th, 1891.  With that idea in view, the Directors of the Choral Society have been requested to arrange a Festival, this they have consented to do, provided the consent of yourself and associates can be obtained for the use of the Tabernacle on that occasion.  Accordingly we take pleasure in requesting that you will grant the use of the Tabernacle as above indicated. This Musical Festival is to be complimentary to members attending the Congress and in order that they may cover expenses the Choral Society merely wishes the privilege of charging a nominal popular price of admission.  Hoping that this request may meet with your favorable consideration, we remain,  Yours Most Respectfully Jno W. Donnellan Chairman General Committee of Arrangements.  Frank K. Gillespie. Secretary.

If his father should go to Germa ny, it would be rather hard on the famely to call them both.
