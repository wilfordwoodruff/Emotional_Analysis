Concerning my feelings with regard to this call I will say, I have not sought for the priv- ilege of preaching the gospel. I realize that the work is important, and that I am very insignificant and poorly prepared for such a work, but if you desire, if it is the will of the Lord for me to un- dertake such a work I trust that my way will  be opened up.  If you choose to call me, please let me know at once what things in the shape of books, clothing etc. I will need, as I have but little money to purchase these things with and will have to make turns with other things to get the necessities. This will require some time.  Your Brother, Jedediah Taylor.  John Tingey Bishop ENDENTRY John D. Westbrook Aug. 23 1896. ENDENTRY President Wilford Woodruff.

However in accepting such a labor, I shall be compelled to do so under great financial embarrassments, as I have been attending school for two years, and am under obligations for the means thus spent.  This together with a homestead entry that lacks two years of being completed and the raising of the means where with to secure some school land that will soon be in market make the acceptance doubly hard.  Now Dear Brother if you think it wise fore me to abandon the land and go under these circumstances, I am at your command. If not, as soon as the land is secured I shall be pleased to accept any labor that you may require. I should like to know your wishes in this matter as soon as practicable.  Your Brother John E.

For it cannot be possible for the authority to be taken from a church until they sin against the Holy Ghost.

ENDENTRY AN ADDRESS FROM PRESI- DENT WOODRUFF  IN RELATION TO THE MANTI TEMPLE.  SALT LAKE CITY, Oct. 20th, 1887.  To the Presidents of Stakes, Bishop and Saints generally:  It is with profound feelings of grat- itude and thanksgiving to our heaven- ly Father that we announce to the  Latter-day Saints that the Temple which is being erected at Manti has been so nearly completed as to be ready for the upholstering, furniture, carpets, etc., which are necessary to put it in a state of complete prepara- tion for the sacred labors to be per- formed therein. This is the third building of this character which in the kind providence of God the Latter-day Saints have been per- mitted to erect and finish in these mountains. The Temple at Salt Lake City is also progressing in a satisfactory manner, which, when finished, will be the fourth Temple that has been constructed by the Saints under the direction of the Al- mighty since we came to these val- leys.  How blesed are the peope who have had these glorious privileges granted unto them! Our hearts swell with inexpressible feelings of thanks- giving and joy to our Father in heaven that he has permitted His Saints to build these houses. They now have opportunities to act as Saviors of their fellowmen, which but few genera- tions of the children of men have ever enjoyed. The great work of the res- toration of the dead which will occupy the time and thought of fu- ture 8generations has now begun, never more to end until the earth is sanctified and the plan of salvation de- vised in the eternal worlds for human redemption is fully consummated.  Our object in addressing you in this  circular is to present to all the mem bers of the Church the opportunity of contributing, according to their means and liberality, something towards the furnishing of the Manti Temple. Here tofore the contributions for that build- ing have been confined to the Stakes which are numbered in what is known as the "Manti Temple District." Be- fore the Logan Temple was completed an opportunity was given to the Saints to contribute towards the purchasing of its furnishings, fur- niture, etc. They gladly responded to the call which was made upon them. We feel that they will, on the present occasion appreciate the privilege of contributing in like manner towards the purchasing of suitable upholstery, carpetings, etc., for the Manti Temple. The funds of the Superintendent are exhausted; and contracts are already made for needed articles, which have to be met at an early date.  Contributions will be taken from twenty-five cents upwards, so that those who are the most limited in means need not be debarred, while those who are more wealthy, can have the satisfaction and pleasure of making donations according to their ability for the completion of this noble edifice. We would like the Presidents and Bishops to give every one an opportunity of doing some- thing in this direction, and the names of all, with the amounts contributed, should be carefuly taken.  We would like to see the names of every man, woman and child in the  Church recorded in the Archives of the Temple as having contributed something towards its erection and completion.  These funds with the donors' names, can either be forwarded to the office of the Presiding Bishop or to the Chief Clerk—Brother James Jack, at the President's Office.  It is important that these collections should be made and remitted as promptly as possible, as the need for this means is pressing.  WILFORD WOODRUFF,  In behalf of the Council of the Apos- tles. ENDENTRY 776 LATTER-DAY SAINTS' MILLENNIAL STAR.  THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS' MILLENNIAL STAR.  THURSDAY, DECEMBER 3, 1896, AN ADDRESS.  To the officers and members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day  Saints:  Dear Brethren and Sisters—It has been a practice in the Church of  Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, sanctioned by the word of the Lord, to  fast and pray, and in this manner to seek for that faith which Saints should possess, and obtain that spirit of humility which we are com- manded to cultivate.  Shortly after the arrival of the people in the valley of the Great Salt Lake, the first Thursday in each month was set apart as a day of fasting and prayer.  The members of the Church were enjoined to bring on that  day their contributions for the relief and sustenance of the poor, and hand  them to the Bishop of the ward.  At the time of the adoption of this regulation it was very convenient for the people generally to meet together in their places of worship on that  day.  The conditions were such that they, being of one faith, employers and employed, could leave their labor and devote a few hours to the Lord.  For many years these meetings were well attended, and they were of a  most interesting character, and were a comfort and a strength to all who  shared in them, as it was the practice for persons of both sexes to bear their testimony and take active part in them in each ward under the  direction of the bishopric.  As the years rolled by, conditions changed, and it became more difficult for the people generally, and especially those in steady employment to  attend these meetings, until at the present time they have dwindled to  such an extent that comparatively few have the opportunity of attending them.  Thursday as a day of fasting and prayer in the church no longer  serves the object for which it was intended.  Our attention has been called to this subject, and after mature delibera- tion, it has been decided to change the day that has heretofore been  devoted to this purpose.  Instead of the customary assemblages in the  various wards throughout Zion on the first Thursday in each month, we  have concluded to set apart the first Sunday in every month as the day  for the regular fast meeting.  Hereafter, therefore, we desire the Latter-day Saints, under the direction  of the Presidents of Stakes and the Bishops, to meet in their several places  of worship on the afternoon of the first Sunday in each month, whenever  it can be done conveniently, and devote the meeting to the administration  ENDENTRY until such time as the church should be willing to remember the precepts of the gospel and obey the commandments. The word "rejected" meands there "hindered."  Now when we present the law of equality they cry "heresy" for they have the means all safe.  I have spent my winter in look ing after the saints who are under poverty and distress and before another winter they must have  deliverance and relief. I have sought the Lord in diligence for knowledge concerning it and have been shown many things yet to come to pass. We have been fasting on Tues. and Fri.  evenings those who are ^in^ need, for the redemption of Zion.  It is as strange to me as it ENDENTRY will be to you that this work has been pushed by the sisters. Why I cannot tell but this I know it has taken much prayer and supplication to God to carry the work thus far and while we have the foundation laid here to compel the reorganization to assist in establishing the poor in Zion, yet we must have more means or some to supply the present need. The cause of a woman being chosen to begin and perhaps direct the work for the present (subject to the criticism or counsel of any member of the church or any part of it) ^so far as they shall know of it^ is for the purpose of doing the work so quietly that the heads of the church who are now Jealous because the Lord has condi^s^cended to listen to the pleadings of hone of his handmaids (when she knew not what else to do but go to the Lord) ENDENTRY Pleasant Green Ward Jan 6th 1896 Riter P.

We feel assured that excellent results will follow the  giving of members of the Church an opportunity to bear their testimony  to each other and to seek for the gifts which the Lord has promised to  those who keep His commandments.  Care should also be taken on such occasions to see that the wants of the  poor are relieved by the contributions of the Saints in their behalf, that  no cry of the indigent or suffering shall arise from our land in the ears of  the Lord of Sabaoth.  In Tabernacle on the afternoon of the first Sunday in each month, we have concluded that  it will be better for that service to be dispensed with, and for the Latter- day Saints to meet in their several wards on that afternoon, so as to give  all the members of the ward, including the aged and infirm, and others  who are unable to go the Tabernacle, an opportunity to participate in  the fast meeting and share in the blessings of the occasion.  In other Stakes where general meetings are held as in this city, we suggest that  they also be dispensed with on the first Sunday of each month, and that the Saints meet in their places of worship in the several wards.  In some places the custom has arisen to consider it a fast to omit eating breakfast.  This is not in accordance with the views and practice of  the past.  When fasts were observed in the early days, it was the rule to  not partake of food from the previous day until after the meeting in  the aftrnoon of the fast day.  In making donations to the poor also it has been the understanding that the food that would be necessary for the two  meals should be donated to the poor, and as much more as those who are  liberally inclined and have the means may feel disposed to give.  In giving this counsel to the Church upon this subject, we include all  the missions where the Elders are laboring, either in the United States or  in foreign lands.  We think this arrangement will suit the convenience  and circumstances of all the Latter-day Saints throughout the world, and  we would like it to be observed by all the organized branches of the Church  in every land, so that our fasting and praying may be uniform and the  time be understood by all.  Before closing this address to the Saints, we feel led to say that if there  should be sickness or any evil resting upon or threatening the people, these meetings furnish an excellent opportunity to bring such afflictions  and troubles before the Lord.  By approaching Him in the spirit of humility and union, we can supplicate Him to remove these afflictions or  evils from the individuals or from the people.  Our past experience has proved to us how willing our Father in Heaven is to hear our cries in the  hours of extremity and difficulty, when we approach Him in a proper spirit and with proper faith.  He is quick to hear the cries of His people and He has promised to us that if we will draw near unto Him, He will draw near unto us.  Such occasions as these, therefore, ought to be taken advan- tage of by the afflicted, whether in an individual or in a collective capacity.

Shortly after the arrival of the people in the valley of the Great Salt Lake, the first Thursday in each month was set apart as a day of fasting and  prayer. The members of the Church were enjoined to bring on that day  their contributions for the relief and  sustenance of the poor, and hand them to the Bishop of the ward.  At the time of the adoption of this  regulation it was very convenient for the people generally to meet together  in their places of worship on that day.  The conditions were such that they, being of one faith, employers and em- ployed, could leave their labor and devote a few hours to the Lord.  For many years these meetings were well attended, and they were of a  most interesting character, and were a  comfort and a strength to all who  shared in them, as it was the practice for persons of both sexes to bear their  testimony and take active part in them  in each ward under the direction of the bishopric.  As the years rolled by, conditions changed, and it became more difficult  for the people generally, and especially  those in steady employment, to attend  these meetings, until at the present  time they have dwindled to such an  extent that comparatively few have the opportunity of attending them. Thurs- day as a day of fasting and prayer in  the Church no longer serves  the object for which it was intended.  Our attention has been called to this subject, and after mature deliberation,  it has been decided to change the day  that has heretofore been devoted to this purpose. Instead of the custom- ary assemblages in the various wards throughout Zion on the first Thursday in each month, we have concluded to set apart the first Sunday in every  month as the day for the regular fast  meeting.  Hereafter, therefore, we desire the Latter-day Saints, under the direction  of the Presidents of Stakes and the Bishops, to meet in their several places  of worship on the afternoon of the first Sunday in each month, whenever it  can be done conveniently, and devote  the meeting to the administration of  the Sacrament, to the bearing of testi- mony by the members of the Church, to the blessing of children and the con- firming of members in the Church, and to such other services as have usually been attended to at such meet- ings. We feel assured that excellent re- sults will follow the giving of members  of the Church an opportunity to bear their testimony to each other and to seek for the gifts which the Lord has promised to those who keep His com- mandments.  Care should also be taken on such  occasions to see that the wants of the poor are relieved by the contributions of the Saints in their behalf, that no  cry of the indigent or suffering shall  arise from our land in the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth.  In Salt Lake City, instead of the people meeting in the Tabernacle on the afternoon of the first Sunday in  each month, we have concluded that it will be better for that service to be  dispensed with, and for the Latter-day  Saints to meet in their several wards on that afternoon, so as to give all the  members of the ward, including the  aged and infirm, and others who are  unable to go to the Tabernacle, an op- portunity to participate in the fast  meeting and share in the blessings of  the occasion. In other Stakes where  general meetings are held as in this  city, we suggest that they also be dis- pensed with on the first Sunday of  each month, and that the Saints meet in their places of worship in the sev- eral wards.  In some places the custom has arisen  to consider it a fast to omit eating breakfast. This is not in accordance  with the views and practice of the  past. When fasts were observed in  the early days, it was the rule to not partake of food from the previous day until after the meeting in the  afternoon of the fast day. In making  donations to the poor also it has been the understanding that the food that  would be necessary for the two meals  should be donated to the poor, and as much more as those who are liberally inclined and have the means may feel disposed to give.  In giving this counsel to the Church  upon this subject, we include all the  missions where the Elders are  laboring, either in the United States or in foreign lands. We think  this arrangement will suit the convenience and circumstances of all the Latter-day Saints throughout  the world, and we would like it to be observed by all the organized branches of the Church in every land, so that  our fasting and praying may be uni- form and the time be understood by all.  Before closing this address to the Saints, we feel led to say that if there should be sickness or any evil resting upon or threatening the people, these meetings furnish  an excellent opportunity to bring such  afflictions and troubles before the Lord.  By approaching Him in the spirit of humility and union, we can suppli- cate Him to remove these afflic- tions or evils from the individuals or from the people. Our past ex- perience has proved to us how will- ing our Father in Heaven is to  hear our cries in the hours  of extremity and difficulty,  when we approach Him in a proper  spirit and with proper faith. He is quick to hear the cries of His people, and He has promised to us that if we will  draw near unto Him, He will draw near unto us. Such occasions as these,  therefore, ought to be taken advantage of by the afflicted, whether in an in- dividual or in a collective capacity.  With constant prayers for your wel- fare and happiness and the prosperity of the work of God,  We are your brethren,  WILFORD WOODRUFF, GEORGE Q. CANNON,  JOSEPH F. SMITH, First Presidency.

No. 36, Vol. L. Monday, September 3, 1888. Price One Penny.  A PIONEER ADDRESS.  THE following address from President  Wilford Woodruff was read before the assembled Sabbath schools of  Salt Lake City at their celebration  of Pioneer Day:  To the Pioneers and Citizens, and to the Officers and Members of the Sabbath Schools.  MY DEAR FRIENDS, Forty-one  years ago this day I passed through  Immigration Canyon with President  Brigham Young. He was taken sick  on East Canyon Creek, and I made a  bed for him in my carriage. When we  came upon the bench, where we had  a fair view of the valley before us, I  turned the side of the vehicle to the  west, so that he could obtain a fair  view of the valley. President Young  arose from his bed and took a survey  of the country before him for several  minutes. He then said to me, "Drive  on down into the valley; this is our  abiding place. I have seen it before  in vision. In this valley will be built  the City of the Saints and the Temple  of our God." I drove down to the  encampment already formed by a por- tion of our company, who had cut a  road through the quaking-asp groves  of timber which were in the bed of  the canyon and come in ahead of us.  We arrived in the encampment at  11:30 on the morning of the 24th of  July, 1847. The brethren had already  turned out City Creek and irrigated  the dry and barren soil, being the first  irrigation ever performed by any one  in these mountains in this age. They  had also commenced to plough some  ground, and that noble pioneer, Wil- liam Carter, whose circumstances pre- vent him meeting with the pioneers  to-day, broke the first ground and  laid the first furrow. The ploughshare  that performed the work is on the  stand to-day. On my arrival in camp,  before I ate my dinner, I planted two  bushels of potatoes in the ground  broken up. President Young com- menced to recover from his sickness  the hour he entered the valley. On a  day or two following our arrival a  remarkable incident occurred. While  President Young was walking with  several of the apostles on the higher  ground north-west of the encamp- ment, he suddenly stepped out, struck  his cane into the barren ground and  sagebrush, and exclaimed, "Right  here will stand the Temple of our ENDENTRY God." We had a peg driven down, and it was nearly in the middle of the Temple as it stands to-day, which  Temple was built without any regard to the spot designated by President  Young at the time. On the 26th we went to the top of a high point on the north of the city, which President  Young named "Ensign Peak." We  also visited the Hot and Warm  Springs. On the 27th we drove to the West Mountains, and visited the Salt Lake, President Young being the first man to dip his hand into the briny water. We walked dryshod to  the Black Rock and took a bath in the lake. Afterwards preparations  were made for laying out the city, and  I with other brethren, assisted Presi- dent Young in laying out the ground  and streets with chain and compass.  He laid out a block of ten acres upon  which to build a Temple, and city lots of one acre and a quarter, and streets eight rods wide, all of which have been published by historians. President Young left Winter Quarters  on the 7th day of April, accompanied by seven other apostles and other men  all told 143 men and three women.  The apostles were Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, Wilford Woodruff,  Willard Richards,  Ezra T. Benson. John  Taylor arrived soon after, leading companies of families. Orson Hyde remained at Kanesville. We traveled the first 500 miles without any grass.  With the exception of the little grain we fed our animals, they lived entirely  on the bark of cottonwood limbs and  saplings which they knawed from the  cottonwood we would lay before them  for their night's meal. This company of 143 men traveled 1,000 miles,  making their roads and building their bridges. In one instance we had to  form a guard of a wedge shape for  three days and nights to keep our company from being trampled to  death by an enormous herd of buffalo that had gathered from the mountains and were migrating in a solid body to the plains below. The herd was judged  to be sixty miles in length, and  numbered not less than one million. They were traveling east, and we were traveling west. We were three days  passing through the herd, and we all breathed freer when we were clear of them. No other class of men will  ever witness the same scene again upon the face of the earth. Brother  Wm. C. A. Smoot, sen., got his horses loose and mixed with the herd, and it  was with great difficulty that we ob- tained them again.  Notwithstanding our first care was  to secure an abiding place, a home for the people, we did not lose sight of  other important matters. President Young contemplated at that early day  the building of a railroad across the continent, and we marked out the route which we thought the national  road would take to unite the Atlantic  and Pacific Oceans.  Brothers Orson Pratt and Erastus Snow entered the valley two or three  days before the body of the pioneers; but where are those men to-day, and where is President Brigham Young  and the apostles who accompanied  him? All are in the spirit world,  mingling with the martyred prophets, where they can plead for their breth- ren. Not one of them living to-day  except myself, and but few of the  pioneers remain. We have buried a  whole quorum of twelve apostles since  we entered these valleys of the moun- tains. The remnant of Zion's Camp,  Mormon Battalion, and the pioneers,  number but very few to-day. Those of us who remain will soon pass away, but our posterity lives and are num- bered in the Primaries, the Sabbath Schools, and the Mutual Improve- ment Associations, and are this day assembled in this great Tabernacle to celebrate the arrival of the pioneers into this great American desert, which  to-day, through the blessing of God and labor of the pioneers, is blossom- ing as the rose.  This company of pioneers spent about a month in this valley, during which period we erected what is known as  the Old Fort, surrounding three sides  of the ten-acre block with an adobe wall on the outside, and the east side with log cabins. We also arranged for this fort to have four entrances, one  on each point of the compass.  Most of the pioneers returned to  Winter Quarters, where they reached  in the fall, making a journey of over  ENDENTRY 2,000 miles, besides the labors per- formed while here in building a fort,  laying out the city, and exploring the adjacent valleys.  I wish to say a few words to the members of the Sabbath Schools, and  to all who are assembled in this Taber- nacle to-day to celebrate the arrival  of the pioneers into this valley. It is  not wisdom for us to occupy your time with a long address upon an occasion  of this kind; but I have referred to a few incidents of our peculiar journey into this barren desert, that you can keep in mind the toil, the care, and the hardships which your fathers en- dured in laying the foundation of the  Zion of our God which is to be estab- lished in the mountains of Israel in  fulfillment of the blessings the old  Patriarch, Jacob, pronounced upon  his posterity that should be fulfilled  in the valleys of the everlasting hills in the latter days; and upon the heads of the rising generation of the Latter-day Saints rests the responsi- bility of building up the kingdom of  God upon the foundations which their fathers have laid. And also of build- ing up a State in which shall dwell virtue, temperance, industry, frugality,  and honesty; a State which will do  honor to the American Government,  where wholesome laws shall be ad- ministered in equity and justice to all  of its citizens according to the letter  and spirit of the Constitution given by inspiration of Almighty God to  our forefathers.  I feel to say to our children, honor your father and your mother and your  God, that your days may be long and prosperous in these valleys of the mountains which the Lord your God hath given unto you.  That God may bless you all, and  enable you to fulfill the object of your  creation here on earth to the satisfac- tion of yourselves and your Creator,  is the earnest desire of your friend and brother,  WILFORD WOODRUFF.

Two or three days previous  to that date however, I was subpoenaed to appear before the District Court (as a witness) on Dec 2nd 1896. I have tried to induce the attorneys in the case to arrange to take my deposition, but so far without success— I shall make another effort, but seeing that some considirable delay is unavoidable I write you to explain.  I consulted Stake Prest.

MANASSA, COLO., July 29 1896  President Wilford Woodruff  Dear Brother:  After due deliberation I have considered that I cannot get ready to start on my mission to the Northern States at so early a date as Aug 15, 1896.  I owe about $460.00 due at intervals from Sep. 3, 1896 to  Feby. 25 1897, 1/2 of it due Sep 3, 1896. I have about enough due me from all sources to pay this if I can collect it.  Part of it, I am sure of, as it is invested in County and School District warrants, which are not due yet but most of them will be in the next six months. I wish therefore to ask for time to collect and arrange for the payment of my debts.  Part of the debts, $22500, are for money borrowed—the others for payments on land and machinery. I have 80 acres of farm land bought last year from State of Colorado, on which I have only made the first payment (ten per cent of price) and  as I will have to depend on the products of this land for maintenance of my family (consisting of my wife and six  children) I want to arrange for the payments to be such, so I will not lose the land. I have besides this, a little land—but it is not suited to cultivation, I use it for pasture. Under the circumstances I feel permitted to ask for ENDENTRY All we want is the truth concerning all matters  The Strangites claim you did not cut Strang of. They  claim you could not cut him off. Any more than you could cutt Joseph off before his death.  I wish you would clear this up — it gives them a weapon to fight us.  Please send us Crandle, Duns Dunns P. O. and oblige.  If you and will notice, Green and Dunn did not expel him until Aug. While you cut him of between April and the 27 of June. How could they cut off what was not in the fold. Again how could they cup off what  was not on — or in the fold. As you and EldSmith had already cut off. Pleas explain.  John Wake  ENDENTRY
