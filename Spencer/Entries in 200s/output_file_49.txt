This is the third building of this character which in the kind providence of God the Latter-day Saints have been per- mitted to erect and finish in these mountains. The Temple at Salt Lake City is also progressing in a satisfactory manner, which, when finished, will be the fourth Temple that has been constructed by the Saints under the direction of the Al- mighty since we came to these val- leys.   have had these glorious privileges granted unto them! Our hearts swell with inexpressible feelings of thanks- giving and joy to our Father in heaven that he has permitted His Saints to build these houses. They now have opportunities to act as Saviors of their fellowmen, which but few genera- tions of the children of men have ever enjoyed. The great work of the res- toration of the dead which will occupy the time and thought of fu- ture  never more to end until the earth is sanctified and the plan of salvation de- vised in the eternal worlds for human redemption is fully consummated.   circular is to present to all the mem bers of the Church the opportunity of contributing, according to their means and liberality, something towards the furnishing of the Manti Temple. Here tofore the contributions for that build- ing have been confined to the Stakes which are numbered in what is known as the "Manti Temple District." Be- fore the Logan Temple was completed an opportunity was given to the Saints to contribute towards the purchasing of its furnishings, fur- niture, etc. They gladly responded to the call which was made upon them. We feel that they will, on the present occasion appreciate the privilege of contributing in like manner towards the purchasing of suitable upholstery, carpetings, etc., for the Manti Temple. The funds of the Superintendent are exhausted; and contracts are already made for needed articles, which have to be met at an early date.   twenty-five cents upwards, so that those who are the most limited in means need not be debarred, while those who are more wealthy, can have the satisfaction and pleasure of making donations according to their ability for the completion of this noble edifice. We would like the Presidents and Bishops to give every one an opportunity of doing some- thing in this direction, and the names of all, with the amounts contributed, should be carefuly taken.   every man, woman and child in the  Church recorded in the Archives of the Temple as having contributed something towards its erection and completion.   can either be forwarded to the office of the Presiding Bishop or to the Chief Clerk—Brother James Jack, at the President's Office.   should be made and remitted as promptly as possible, as the need for this means is pressing.     tles.

The members of the Church were enjoined to bring on that  day their contributions for the relief and sustenance of the poor, and hand  them to the Bishop of the ward.   for the people generally to meet together in their places of worship on that  day.  The conditions were such that they, being of one faith, employers and employed, could leave their labor and devote a few hours to the Lord.   most interesting character, and were a comfort and a strength to all who  shared in them, as it was the practice for persons of both sexes to bear their testimony and take active part in them in each ward under the  direction of the bishopric.   for the people generally, and especially those in steady employment to  attend these meetings, until at the present time they have dwindled to  such an extent that comparatively few have the opportunity of attending them.  Thursday as a day of fasting and prayer in the church no longer  serves the object for which it was intended.   tion, it has been decided to change the day that has heretofore been  devoted to this purpose.

In other Stakes where general meetings are held as in this city, we suggest that  they also be dispensed with on the first Sunday of each month, and that the Saints meet in their places of worship in the several wards.   breakfast.  This is not in accordance with the views and practice of  the past.  When fasts were observed in the early days, it was the rule to  not partake of food from the previous day until after the meeting in  the aftrnoon of the fast day.

We think this arrangement will suit the convenience  and circumstances of all the Latter-day Saints throughout the world, and  we would like it to be observed by all the organized branches of the Church  in every land, so that our fasting and praying may be uniform and the  time be understood by all.   should be sickness or any evil resting upon or threatening the people, these meetings furnish an excellent opportunity to bring such afflictions  and troubles before the Lord.  By approaching Him in the spirit of humility and union, we can supplicate Him to remove these afflictions or  evils from the individuals or from the people.  Our past experience has proved to us how willing our Father in Heaven is to hear our cries in the  hours of extremity and difficulty, when we approach Him in a proper spirit and with proper faith.  He is quick to hear the cries of His people and He has promised to us that if we will draw near unto Him, He will draw near unto us.

The members of the Church were enjoined to bring on that day  their contributions for the relief and  sustenance of the poor, and hand them to the Bishop of the ward.   regulation it was very convenient for the people generally to meet together  in their places of worship on that day.  The conditions were such that they, being of one faith, employers and em- ployed, could leave their labor and devote a few hours to the Lord.   well attended, and they were of a  most interesting character, and were a  comfort and a strength to all who  shared in them, as it was the practice for persons of both sexes to bear their  testimony and take active part in them  in each ward under the direction of the bishopric.   changed, and it became more difficult  for the people generally, and especially  those in steady employment, to attend  these meetings, until at the present  time they have dwindled to such an  extent that comparatively few have the opportunity of attending them. Thurs- day as a day of fasting and prayer in  the Church no longer serves  the object for which it was intended.   subject, and after mature deliberation,  it has been decided to change the day  that has heretofore been devoted to this purpose. Instead of the custom- ary assemblages in the various wards throughout Zion on the first Thursday in each month, we have concluded to set apart the first Sunday in every  month as the day for the regular fast  meeting.   Latter-day Saints, under the direction  of the Presidents of Stakes and the Bishops, to meet in their several places  of worship on the afternoon of the first Sunday in each month, whenever it  can be done conveniently, and devote  the meeting to the administration of  the Sacrament, to the bearing of testi- mony by the members of the Church, to the blessing of children and the con- firming of members in the Church, and to such other services as have usually been attended to at such meet- ings. We feel assured that excellent re- sults will follow the giving of members  of the Church an opportunity to bear their testimony to each other and to seek for the gifts which the Lord has promised to those who keep His com- mandments.   occasions to see that the wants of the poor are relieved by the contributions of the Saints in their behalf, that no  cry of the indigent or suffering shall  arise from our land in the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth.   people meeting in the Tabernacle on the afternoon of the first Sunday in  each month, we have concluded that it will be better for that service to be  dispensed with, and for the Latter-day  Saints to meet in their several wards on that afternoon, so as to give all the  members of the ward, including the  aged and infirm, and others who are  unable to go to the Tabernacle, an op- portunity to participate in the fast  meeting and share in the blessings of  the occasion. In other Stakes where  general meetings are held as in this  city, we suggest that they also be dis- pensed with on the first Sunday of  each month, and that the Saints meet in their places of worship in the sev- eral wards.   to consider it a fast to omit eating breakfast. This is not in accordance  with the views and practice of the  past. When fasts were observed in  the early days, it was the rule to not partake of food from the previous day until after the meeting in the  afternoon of the fast day. In making  donations to the poor also it has been the understanding that the food that  would be necessary for the two meals  should be donated to the poor, and as much more as those who are liberally inclined and have the means may feel disposed to give.   upon this subject, we include all the  missions where the Elders are  laboring, either in the United States or in foreign lands. We think  this arrangement will suit the convenience and circumstances of all the Latter-day Saints throughout  the world, and we would like it to be observed by all the organized branches of the Church in every land, so that  our fasting and praying may be uni- form and the time be understood by all.   Saints, we feel led to say that if there should be sickness or any evil resting upon or threatening the people, these meetings furnish  an excellent opportunity to bring such  afflictions and troubles before the Lord.  By approaching Him in the spirit of humility and union, we can suppli- cate Him to remove these afflic- tions or evils from the individuals or from the people. Our past ex- perience has proved to us how will- ing our Father in Heaven is to  hear our cries in the hours  of extremity and difficulty,  when we approach Him in a proper  spirit and with proper faith. He is quick to hear the cries of His people, and He has promised to us that if we will  draw near unto Him, He will draw near unto us. Such occasions as these,  therefore, ought to be taken advantage of by the afflicted, whether in an in- dividual or in a collective capacity.   fare and happiness and the prosperity of the work of God,   WILFORD WOODRUFF, GEORGE Q. CANNON,  JOSEPH F. SMITH, First Presidency. ENDENTRY  MILLENNIAL STAR.   it is because there is no light in them."       Wilford Woodruff was read before the assembled Sabbath schools of  Salt Lake City at their celebration  of Pioneer Day:   the Officers and Members of the Sabbath Schools.   years ago this day I passed through  Immigration Canyon with President  Brigham Young. He was taken sick  on East Canyon Creek, and I made a  bed for him in my carriage. When we  came upon the bench, where we had  a fair view of the valley before us, I  turned the side of the vehicle to the  west, so that he could obtain a fair  view of the valley. President Young  arose from his bed and took a survey  of the country before him for several  minutes. He then said to me, "Drive  on down into the valley; this is our  abiding place. I have seen it before  in vision. In this valley will be built  the City of the Saints and the Temple  of our God." I drove down to the  encampment already formed by a por- tion of our company, who had cut a  road through the quaking-asp groves  of timber which were in the bed of  the canyon and come in ahead of us.  We arrived in the encampment at  11:30 on the morning of the 24th of  July, 1847. The brethren had already  turned out City Creek and irrigated  the dry and barren soil, being the first  irrigation ever performed by any one  in these mountains in this age. They  had also commenced to plough some  ground, and that noble pioneer, Wil- liam Carter, whose circumstances pre- vent him meeting with the pioneers  to-day, broke the first ground and  laid the first furrow. The ploughshare  that performed the work is on the  stand to-day. On my arrival in camp,  before I ate my dinner, I planted two  bushels of potatoes in the ground  broken up. President Young com- menced to recover from his sickness  the hour he entered the valley. On a  day or two following our arrival a  remarkable incident occurred. While  President Young was walking with  several of the apostles on the higher  ground north-west of the encamp- ment, he suddenly stepped out, struck  his cane into the barren ground and  sagebrush, and exclaimed, "Right  here will stand the Temple of our ENDENTRY  and it was nearly in the middle of the Temple as it stands to-day, which  Temple was built without any regard to the spot designated by President  Young at the time. On the 26th we went to the top of a high point on the north of the city, which President  Young named "Ensign Peak." We  also visited the Hot and Warm  Springs. On the 27th we drove to the West Mountains, and visited the Salt Lake, President Young being the first man to dip his hand into the briny water. We walked dryshod to  the Black Rock and took a bath in the lake. Afterwards preparations  were made for laying out the city, and  I with other brethren, assisted Presi- dent Young in laying out the ground  and streets with chain and compass.  He laid out a block of ten acres upon  which to build a Temple, and city lots of one acre and a quarter, and streets eight rods wide, all of which have been published by historians. President Young left Winter Quarters  on the 7th day of April, accompanied by seven other apostles and other men  all told 143 men and three women.  The apostles were Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, Wilford Woodruff,  Willard Richards,  Ezra T. Benson. John  Taylor arrived soon after, leading companies of families. Orson Hyde remained at Kanesville. We traveled the first 500 miles without any grass.  With the exception of the little grain we fed our animals, they lived entirely  on the bark of cottonwood limbs and  saplings which they knawed from the  cottonwood we would lay before them  for their night's meal. This company of 143 men traveled 1,000 miles,  making their roads and building their bridges. In one instance we had to  form a guard of a wedge shape for  three days and nights to keep our company from being trampled to  death by an enormous herd of buffalo that had gathered from the mountains and were migrating in a solid body to the plains below. The herd was judged  to be sixty miles in length, and  numbered not less than one million. They were traveling east, and we were traveling west. We were three days  passing through the herd, and we all breathed freer when we were clear of them. No other class of men will  ever witness the same scene again upon the face of the earth. Brother  Wm. C. A. Smoot, sen., got his horses loose and mixed with the herd, and it  was with great difficulty that we ob- tained them again.   to secure an abiding place, a home for the people, we did not lose sight of  other important matters. President Young contemplated at that early day  the building of a railroad across the continent, and we marked out the route which we thought the national  road would take to unite the Atlantic  and Pacific Oceans.   Snow entered the valley two or three  days before the body of the pioneers; but where are those men to-day, and where is President Brigham Young  and the apostles who accompanied  him? All are in the spirit world,  mingling with the martyred prophets, where they can plead for their breth- ren. Not one of them living to-day  except myself, and but few of the  pioneers remain. We have buried a  whole quorum of twelve apostles since  we entered these valleys of the moun- tains. The remnant of Zion's Camp,  Mormon Battalion, and the pioneers,  number but very few to-day. Those of us who remain will soon pass away, but our posterity lives and are num- bered in the Primaries, the Sabbath Schools, and the Mutual Improve- ment Associations, and are this day assembled in this great Tabernacle to celebrate the arrival of the pioneers into this great American desert, which  to-day, through the blessing of God and labor of the pioneers, is blossom- ing as the rose.   a month in this valley, during which period we erected what is known as  the Old Fort, surrounding three sides  of the ten-acre block with an adobe wall on the outside, and the east side with log cabins.
