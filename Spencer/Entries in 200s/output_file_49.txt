I would therefore  suggest if not out of the way, that  he be allowed one Month more time  to prepare in, and if he can get  ready before that time he will report.    Respectfully yours  Geo L.

 crumb of comfort for me there as  my mind was made up I could not  stay untill I reachd the place I  started for the house of the saints  I hope to receive an answer to this  to know if the forty Dollars can be  available for my passage that I  sent to New York for my parents  to assist them to come in the year  1856 or 7 as they are both dead &  the money has been in the hands  of the Church ever since. if that  can be applied to my case for my  Bennefit I will be glad as it is  a hard thing to get a job to do here  that is more than daily support,  I have two Daughters who are widows  left one with one Daughter & One  with two Daughters in the prime  of Life & I am living with one now  & amout of work at present with  no prospects until fall as it is far  different to what it used to be.  I am  enjoying good health & can work if I only  had it to do. 
 We do not expect bro. Bohner to start  on a mission in poor health, altho  some have had faith to start in that  condition and were healed. We think  he should have time to regain his health  and to prepare himself otherwise if  necessary to take a mission to preach  the gospel to the world.

Book of  Mormon was amongst those I lost I did  manage to get my Doctrine & Covenants  & a few others in a almost ruined  condition but what I did save are  of great value to me & give one comfort  to peruse them & keep me reminded  of past Days. still hoping to find  Gods prople & receive a full pardon  for all past offences. & become one of  those who will be blessed with that  Eternal & Celestial Glory that awaits  those whom God will say come ye blessd  of my Father enter into the joy of you Lord.

 Salt Lake City Aug 15. 92.    President Wilford Woodruff    Dear Brother!    I wrote to you a letter last week, stating my   circumstances and condition in which I am, for   I have recieved a call to go on a mission to Europe   Asking your advise in the matter. I have not yet   recieved an answer, for which I am anxiously waiting   Perhaps my letter did not reach it's destination, therefore   I will repeat that which I wrote to you before. It was   in the spring when I recieved a call to go on a mission   to Switzerland & Germany, but expecting an increase   in my familie, I desired that you would release me   from it until October, by which time I expected   to have enought money saved to provide for my familie   for the first year of my absence. Circumstances have   formed matters in such a shape with me, that I have   not been able to save. Now I would like to go on   that mission for I am anxious to perform this labor   as well as my brethren who are placed in better   circumstances. My familie would need to be supported

 Salt Lake City, Utah, July 30th, 1892.    Hon. Wiford Woodruff,  City.    Dear Sir:    I have had many inquiries from the east regarding the  healthfullness of this Territory, and I wish to prepare a few statistics  to send to future inquirers, and would be pleased if you would have  your proper office furnish me the following information, as soon as  possible.    What is the aproximate number of persons in this city, who  have been in the Territory for many years, or as I would say of the  Pioneers, who are over the age of 75 years.    Your church historian must be able to give with little trouble  a very close estimate of the number in your church in this city who  are above that age. If convenient I would also like the same  estimate of persons over the age of 80.    The object of obtaining these statistics is to make a comparison  and show the percentage of the population over the above ages, as I  am of the opinion that the percentage in this Territory will be much  larger than any Stste or Territory can show, at least I have been  asserting that there is a higher rate of longevity here than can  be found elsewhere.    An early reply will be fully appreciated,  Very Truly,  Jno. J. Cushing    P.O. Box, 268.    (Over)

 will state that I feel I have claims & feel greeved to think  that the church property I helped to earn should be let  to the saints when the aged infirm & poor amongst us kned  it so much though I say it myself it is true I have  ben a faithuf titheing payer commencing Oct 12  1840 which day we opened the quary for rock to build  the nauvoo Temple till now some years I paid 300  dollars & Bishop Callister of 17 ward told me my titheing  record was the best in the ward & if the old mauvoo  titheing Books were open a nice ballance would appear  in my favor & in addition to the foregoing I will ask  why old men should not be favared who have spent  their lives in the church survise will mention a case old  father Edson Barney of St George well near 80 years old  sold his last cow to pay his titheing or be shut out  & when he beged for a pass over R R to salt Lake he was  refused by McAlister & David Cannon Nthey traveled  on passes but the old man was snubed. I have seen other  cases of the kind hence I make the statement it seems a pitty  that the titheing that belong to the poor should be allowed to  go into the hands of wickd as in the church case  well I will conclude by asking you to loan me someth  ing out of tihteing office or give it as you please, will state   that I have taken up 200 acrs of Land here on upper muddy  20 miles above Overton with the view that the Reo grand  western rail road would be built through here but it  is slow comeing we hear it will be in st George in another  year & if it comes on their survey ^Ing^ can then sell my land  I did think some mormons would come but am discouraged  waiting no society no meetings no nothing    With Love & good will ^as ever^ for all Saints J W Crosby

 S. D. PARRISH.  ATTORNEY AT LAW,  RICHMOND, KENTUCKY.  Special Attention Given to Land Titles.    I enclose clipping from The Star,  Arizo., giving synopis of celebration of  the "Latter-Day Saints," July 3rd, in Apache Co.    August 9th, 1892.    Wilford Woodruff, Esqr.,  Salt Lake City.    Dear Sir: I trust the interest I take in the subject men-  tioned will be an excuse sufficient for the liberty I take in  thus addressing you. For several years I have read and studied  every thing I could find relating to the Mormon church, its  morale & its people, its origin & growth and prosperity, and  with especial interest I have watched the various measures  of Congress relating to the matter. I am forced to admit that  there is something far above the ordinary in the teachings and  practices of this people that has enabled them to spread and  propogate their peculiar system so extensively and successfully,  & to do this against poverty & the bitterest persecution, oppression  & vituperation. Above all this, I admire this people for the great good  they have wrought for our common country in redeeming the  waste places in the desert & most abandoned sections of that country.  They have done this, & spent millions of money, thousands of lives in  conquering the savage, clearing the forests, clothing the desert  plains and arid valley with fruitage, towns, cities, roads and other  incident of civilization. All done seemingly in a spirit of self-  denial, patience, fortitude and patriotism!    I have just finished reading a little book by Austin  Phelp, "Our Country," in which he says, among many 
 feel to Excuse him, Please  send him a letter to that Effect as  he is very sensitive on such points    yours very truley  Bp. George Halliday.    We do not desire him to go  on a mission, unless he can  do so without leaving his  family destitute, or to suffer  loss and hardships in his  absence, and would rather  he remain at home until his  circumstances would Jus-  tify him in taking a mission  but if the ward could look  after his family a little, and  see that they did not suffer  he would have nothing to fear   in going now, or soon.

 Cedar City Iron Co Sept 21st 1891    Prest Wilford Woodruff  Salt Lake City    Dear Brother  Some time since I sent you  the names of Bros John Middleton and H.

 other strictures, "The people of the United States are more  sensible of the disgrace of Mormonism than of its  danger, . . . and . . . Mormonism is not  simply a church, but a state; an 'imperium in imperio,'  ruled by a man who is prophet, priest, king and pope, all  in one." I also notice in Howe's "Western America",  1852, V. II, that under authority from the Legislature of the  state of Illinois, in 1842-3, the city council of Nauvoo  passed an ordinance making it imprisonment for life  for any person, with or without process, to attempt to  arrest the Prophet for any offense growing out of  the Missouri difficulties, also another ordinance  making it penal to even a fine of $10000 and six months'  imprisonment, for any officer to serve a process in  Nauvoo without first securing the endorsed sig-  nature of the Mayor thereon!! p. 340. I am  unable to tell whether these and other similar and se-  rious charges be true or not. I trust they are false, and  that there is not the danger to American institutions &  safety that modern prejudiced authors would have  us believe. I have read with great pleasure the  Manifesto of 12 Dec., 1889, by yourself & associated  counselors, & also the declaration of Sept. 24, 1890.

When you requir (and call and blaim  God for calling them) poor Elders to  preach without purse or monney.    When did God reveal that you fellows  should have a standard salary of $2,500  a year, and still keep on saying that you  preach without purse or monney.    When did God ackknowledge the^that^ he could  not se the result of Polygami, as such  he must recalled it.    When did God say, that the sacrament of  the lords supper, should be administer to  the Katolik & protistant to Gentile and liberal  as it does every sunday in the tabernakel

 I am aware that a prediction along any line, either  optimistic or pessimistic, usually falls short of the  honors or blessings foretold, and the predictions are  often erroneous as to the suddenness of the effects, &  frequently as to the kind of effect. We laugh at the  prophecies of those who claimed that Catholic eman-  cipation would tranquillize Ireland. The abolition of  slavery in U. S. has not been accompanied with the  fire & "certain" calamities claimed by those ^the^ proslavery  advocates.  The erecting of Mexico into a consti-  tutional free Republic, has not yet brought  about all the looked for political & social  blessings. Immediate effects, in so far as they  affect humanity historically, are superficial and  shallow. "Causes, says Mr. Mill, which go deep down  "into the roots of future events produce the most serious  "parts of their effect slowly, and have time to become a  "part of the familiar order of things before general  "attention is called to the changes they are producing."  It is an obvious fact that when the changes do  become evident, they are often not seen, on a

 Paris, Idaho  Septr 8th 1891    President W. Woodruff    Dear Bro    I think it proper for me to  represent to you that Elder Oliver ^(or Olavus)^ Jacobsen of  Randolph who has been called on a mission to  Scandivnavia is the Bishop's Counsellor, and a very  active useful man whom we cannot spare without  detriment to the welfare of the Ward. Woodruff is  an outside place with a mixed population and re-  quires all the care the Authorities can give it. Also  the Coop Store of the Town has been badly managed,  but is now under the direction of Bro Jacobsen who  has the confidence of the people and I understsand  of the Z. C. M. I. who would I think probably close  out the Store if Bro Jacobsen (whom they know)  goes off and such action would cause much dissatis-  faction.    I feel it to be my duty to state the foregoing,  and ask if it can consistently be done that Bro

 I had a talk with an a man the other  day, he said, I arrived as Emigrant with wife  and 6 children, Jun 24, and has not been  able to get any work yet. the man cried   as a child. I said are you mormon.  Of course I am, or else I would never been  here. can't you get work at the Temple or Ti-  thinhouses, No they treat me there more like  a dog, and a man.

 cursory examination, to have a peculiar  connection with the cause, and that the remoter  consequences of a new or novel political, social or  theological fact are seldom comprehended when  they do happen, serving when they have been  known & appreciated beforehand. If Mormonism  has done & accomplished for our western U. S. so  much that is great, grand and good, I see no  reason why we & those in power should  annoy & harras that people, if, as is stated in  the mainfesto mentioned, polygamy is not  recognized by the morale of that body as a  legally & divinely authorized institution. As near  as I can get at the matter, so far as polyga  my is concerned, it is regarded as contrary  to the genius & spirit of American civiliza-  tion and political policy, and that that people  have a profound respect & veneration for  the flag & constitution & institutions & tradi-  tions of this our common & beloved country. In  this, I may be indulging an erroneous  conclusion. If so, I am very anxious
