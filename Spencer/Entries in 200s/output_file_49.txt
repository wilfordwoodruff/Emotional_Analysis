 Salt Lake City Aug 15. 92.President Wilford WoodruffDear Brother!I wrote to you a letter last week, stating my circumstances and condition in which I am, for I have recieved a call to go on a mission to Europe Asking your advise in the matter. I have not yet recieved an answer, for which I am anxiously waiting Perhaps my letter did not reach it's destination, therefore I will repeat that which I wrote to you before. It was in the spring when I recieved a call to go on a mission to Switzerland & Germany, but expecting an increase in my familie, I desired that you would release me from it until October, by which time I expected to have enought money saved to provide for my familie for the first year of my absence. Circumstances have formed matters in such a shape with me, that I have not been able to save. Now I would like to go on that mission for I am anxious to perform this labor as well as my brethren who are placed in better circumstances. My familie would need to be supported

If convenient I would also like the sameestimate of persons over the age of 80.The object of obtaining these statistics is to make a comparisonand show the percentage of the population over the above ages, as Iam of the opinion that the percentage in this Territory will be muchlarger than any Stste or Territory can show, at least I have beenasserting that there is a higher rate of longevity here than canbe found elsewhere.An early reply will be fully appreciated,Very Truly,Jno.

PARRISH.ATTORNEY AT LAW,RICHMOND, KENTUCKY.Special Attention Given to Land Titles.I enclose clipping from The Star,Arizo., giving synopis of celebration ofthe "Latter-Day Saints," July 3rd, in Apache Co.August 9th, 1892.Wilford Woodruff, Esqr.,Salt Lake City.Dear Sir: I trust the interest I take in the subject men-tioned will be an excuse sufficient for the liberty I take inthus addressing you. For several years I have read and studiedevery thing I could find relating to the Mormon church, itsmorale & its people, its origin & growth and prosperity, andwith especial interest I have watched the various measuresof Congress relating to the matter. I am forced to admit thatthere is something far above the ordinary in the teachings andpractices of this people that has enabled them to spread andpropogate their peculiar system so extensively and successfully,& to do this against poverty & the bitterest persecution, oppression& vituperation. Above all this, I admire this people for the great goodthey have wrought for our common country in redeeming thewaste places in the desert & most abandoned sections of that country.They have done this, & spent millions of money, thousands of lives inconquering the savage, clearing the forests, clothing the desertplains and arid valley with fruitage, towns, cities, roads and otherincident of civilization. All done seemingly in a spirit of self-denial, patience, fortitude and patriotism!I have just finished reading a little book by AustinPhelp, "Our Country," in which he says, among many

 other strictures, "The people of the United States are moresensible of the disgrace of Mormonism than of itsdanger, . . . and . . . Mormonism is notsimply a church, but a state; an 'imperium in imperio,'ruled by a man who is prophet, priest, king and pope, allin one." I also notice in Howe's "Western America",1852, V. II, that under authority from the Legislature of thestate of Illinois, in 1842-3, the city council of Nauvoopassed an ordinance making it imprisonment for lifefor any person, with or without process, to attempt toarrest the Prophet for any offense growing out ofthe Missouri difficulties, also another ordinancemaking it penal to even a fine of $10000 and six months'imprisonment, for any officer to serve a process inNauvoo without first securing the endorsed sig-nature of the Mayor thereon!! p. 340. I amunable to tell whether these and other similar and se-rious charges be true or not. I trust they are false, andthat there is not the danger to American institutions &safety that modern prejudiced authors would haveus believe.

 I am aware that a prediction along any line, eitheroptimistic or pessimistic, usually falls short of thehonors or blessings foretold, and the predictions areoften erroneous as to the suddenness of the effects, &frequently as to the kind of effect. We laugh at theprophecies of those who claimed that Catholic eman-cipation would tranquillize Ireland. The abolition ofslavery in U. S. has not been accompanied with thefire & "certain" calamities claimed by those ^the^ proslaveryadvocates.  The erecting of Mexico into a consti-tutional free Republic, has not yet broughtabout all the looked for political & socialblessings. Immediate effects, in so far as theyaffect humanity historically, are superficial andshallow. "Causes, says Mr. Mill, which go deep down"into the roots of future events produce the most serious"parts of their effect slowly, and have time to become a"part of the familiar order of things before general"attention is called to the changes they are producing."It is an obvious fact that when the changes dobecome evident, they are often not seen, on a
