President Wells & Kimball spoke in  the morning & President Young Preached in the afternoon and He  [FIGURE] delivered unto the people one of the most interesting Beneficial   doctrinal sermons that was ever delivered unto the House of   Israel. He revealed the principles of the Judgment. He said that  God would Judge the world but How would He Judge the world He would   not sit in Judgment upon Each individual case. But the Lord would  preside over all his Prophets and Apostles of Evry generation and  He sent them forth with a dispensation of the gospel to the children of  men in various ages of the world, those who recieved their testimony   and abided by their council would have no sins to pay for after   death, but the wicked would be Judged after death, it is said that   Christ will Judge the world But He chose 12 Apostles also 70 & many   others as Helps. it is said that the 12 Apostles would sit upon Twelve     
 30th 1862  Thrones & Judge the Twelve tribes of Israel but they will not  Judge all individual cases. Joseph Smith will preside over this dispen-  sation and Judge but He has chosen 12 Apostles 70ties & we have High  Priest, High Council, and Bishops to Jud[g]e the people Joseph will not Judge  Each individual neither shall I neither do I want to spend my time   in listening to the sins & nonsens of the People. But all the saints should   submit to the authority which is over them if a man sins & He is  tryed by his bishop and Judgment passed upon him & the man submits   to that Judgment that is the End of the Law. and this is the fulfilling of   the scripture whare it says that "some mens sins go to Judgment before  while other follow after" if the saints sin and they are tried, Judged   condemned, & the saints submit to that Judgment they will never be Judged   afterwards. this power is given into the Hands of the Apostles or   those who hold the keys of the pristhood that "whosoever sins ye remit   are [remitted] & whosoever sins ye retain are retained and whatsoever ye   bind on Earth is bound in Heaven." I do not Expet that there   will be much time spent after death in Judging the saints but the   wicked will have to be Judged. If I was to say that the sins  of this Church should be remitted & forgiven it would be done  but I dont want to say that for we have got to mayny poor  curses among us who will commit sin and I want them to  pay for there sins many other interiesting remarks were made   by President Young.

 [FIGURES] June 17 1862  into the court yard on the East side of the Court House and  there guarded I went up & took a view of them I saw  Richard Cook who I consider is the most wicked & the  worst man in the company as he took Morris in & was  the means of putting him up to be a prophet & was the main  spring of the organization of the band. He looked vary sheepish  & wicked He partially hid himself behingd his brother John  there were some 80 prisioners the remainder old men and  ignorant were left with the women. the whole of the company  of Prisioners looked wicked. I went into the House and Herd   Dr Clinton give a relation of the affair at South Webber &  I marvel that there was not more killed upon our side than   there was. while conversing Dr Clinton was called for   to go to the Arsenal & dress a wound as one of the brethren  was accidentally shot in the foot. we immediately went   up to the arsenal & found it was Brother Richard Hopkins  the ball went in at the little toe & went along in the flesh  part of the foot towards the Heel. we laid Hands upon him   & I prayed for him & He was then taken holm I went  down to his house on Examination it was found that the ball  went through the toe of the boot and flattened it out to a sharp  Edge it went into the toe joining the little toe mashed the toe to pieces  went through the foot the whole length of it cutting the whole   length of the sole of the foot open as though it had been cut open  with a knife & the ball lodged under the Heel bone it was a serious  wound      June 18, 1862 ~ Wednesday      18 Judge Kinney had a court in the Court House at 9 oclok   this morning to try the prisioners Before the opening of the  court Judge Kinney had some conversation with me He  asked if I was at the funeral of Jared Smith & Herd  President Youngs sermon I said No I was not present. He  said "I was told that President Young said that I was responsible  for all these things and that I was weak in the upper story But  says Judge Kinney I denyed it. I did not Believe it. I have not taken   any step without counciling President Young and when the men   came to sware out their Affidavit I told them they must ask     
 June 198 1862  President Young when they came back they said they had done  so & President Young told them to go to Judge Kinney & Get out  there Affidavits.["] I told the Judge I know nothing in the matter      The Prisioners who Col R Burton took at the surrender of the fort  at South Webber & brought into this court yard yesterday was   brought into this court room at 10 minuts past 9 oclok, the number  being 98. The Court was then declard opened Judge  Kinney then said to the prisioners I want you to understand  that you are here ^not^ to be tried but to be Examined. The Judge  ordered the prisioners to be separated. Richard Cook, Parsons  & Peter Clemgard were placed by themselves as they were named  in the writ. Judge Kinney appointed Mr Miner the Attorney  for the prosicution and Broadhead said He was ingaged on the  defence. But the prisioners denyed Employeding him Broadhead  presented a petition for the Prisioners to have a committee appoi-  nted to take charge of the property of the prisioners the Judge said  the court would take charge of that business. Col Burton  Cunningham & Golden came forward & were sworn as wit-  neseses. Col Burton gave his testimony and said I am the  the MaDepity Marshall of this Territory I attempted to serve 3  writs at south webber I went with a posse as I had good   reason to believe they could not be served without a posse this  was on the 13 June 1862. The men called for would not give  themselves up & I had to use force. I sent a communication  to them and requested an answer in 30 minutes but I waited  90 minutes & received no answer then I fired a cannon  Ball and they returned to fire with small arms and the  fire kept up through the day. some Brethren came to me and   I organized them into my posse. Col Burton drew a map   of the fort and the surroundings. I tried all day to get possessin   of the fort but I ownly got possession of one or two Houses the first  day. the Enemy fired all day but none in the night. On the mor-  ning of the 14 we fired some in the morning But it began to  rain & rained all day and we did not do much. Jared  Smith was shot the first day and died. On Sunday morning  the 15 of June we had fair weather I divided my forces as well     
 June 198 1862  as I could & opened fire with Artillery & small arms from   8 oclok in the morning till 7 oclok at night at that hour I   planted a Battery nearby & took possession of one line of  the fort then I saw a white flag I then told them to come   out & give themselves up they came out & stacked therir arms  and surrendered Parsons was among those who surrendered  I left my Men outside Except Mr Golden & Stodard I  placed some men to take charge of the arms or guard them  then Mr Morris made some remarks and asked me   what I wanted I said I wanted all the men who had taken   up arms against me. Then Morris said theo the croud all  who will stand by me to the death lift up their hand and  all as far as I could see lifted up their hands & made a   rush as though they were going to the school House or some  place to defend themselves I ordered Morris to stop several   times & followed him up I had no arms but my revolver  and as He would not stop I stoped him with my revolver  He was shot dead. Banks was also shot through the neck  from which wound He died two women was shot at   the same time which I vary much regret but it could  not be helped the remainder soon gave themselves up  Parsons denied that the people were under arms to defend  them but did not state what they were under arms for  Jeter Clinton then testifyed that what Burton had said  was true. said that Banks told him that they did  receive the message which Col Burton had sent to them  Peter Wahlen was shot at 6 oclok sunday Evening   before the surrender. R. J. Golden testified that what had  been stated was true as far as He knew. MCCain testified  that He held in his hand a tru copy of the Message sent  to the Morris Camp which was read before the court   and signed as civel officers. Mr Miner said to the  Judge the crime of resistance would have been one year   imprisionment & $1000 dollar fine but two men were kille[d]   this becomes Murder and I ask in the name of the common-  wealth that the law may have thebe ^in^forced     
 June 198 1862  Mr Dow denied having Employed Mr Broadhead to plead  his case. Dow said I Joined Mor Morris & believed him to be  a prophet and I dont know as I have done any thing to  break the Law and I believe now that Morris ias as much  a Prophet as he was before he died. Judge Keinney said  I will dispose of this case and asked Miner if He knew of  some more guilty than others. The Court separated the danes  from the English & then addressed the English and said I wish  to Explain to you the Law you hav violated. On the 22nd day of  May a writ was made out for three man Morris Clemgard  & Cook also a writ of Habeus Corpus for the delivery of 3  men who were falsly imprisioned I made this writ as it  should be and placed it in the Hands of an officer this writ  was sent by a proper but it was set at defiance and knowing  that you was under the influence of Morris and fanaticism  to a great degree that I let it rest 19 days then I issued another  writ of Habaes Corp Habeas Corpus. you may Enjoy your  religion but you cannot break the Law & shed Blood with  impunit & in doing so you cannot Murder. I will aslso  say that you cannot live without work it is contrary  to both Law and gospel. But I will not send you to pri-  sion I will let you ought on bail to appear at the next  term of court I shall require you to Enter into a Bail of  $1500 Each & this is to secure your attendance at court  & you may give bail for Each other and I shall hold all of  you responsible for the appearance of the whole company if any  man goes away & does not appear at court all the property  of the whole company is held in morgage for the payment  of the bond. An Interpeter was imployed to interpret it  to all who not understand English. The names of  all was taken, after this they were discharged but  all there armes were retained untill the sitting of the court  they will be put into the hands of an Officer you are  now dismissed to go where you please but if you take  up arms again to resist an officer they will be taken from   you & you will be arested.

President Young showed us on the map whare the  Apostles Preached the country through which they travelled and   probably it continued to the Archipeligo and that the Malays  had the gospel and that the Israelitish traditions were among   them. President Young said that all the world would have   been warned long ago in our day if all the world had bee[n] as faith-  ful in warning his Neighbor as He & many of the Elders of this   Church. When going to Zion in 1834 Joseph reproved the camp  while standing upon a waggon wheel I said I had done the best   I could & could not Better it if I was to try it again H. C. Kimball   said the same. They said they had been in the Church nearly   half of his life. (I WW have been in the Church more than half   of my life) I remarked that it was an interesting time to live to  to see the fulfillment of the President Young said it was an interesting   time. H C Kimball said we should see it Just as well if Dead as  if alive. President Young said, while we are in the flesh, we have   to contend against evil spirits and Devils in a way which will   be hid from us in the Spirit World. Brother Kimball said in   speaking of our Prayer circle I never saw T. D. Brown in that  circle but what I felt sorry to see him there. President Young  said He would never have been there If you had not Recommended   him for I had not confidence enough in him He leacked [lacked] & so   did Wm. W. Phelps & others, what is spoken in a prayer circle   should never be Named out of the circle not [to] a wife or any body  Els if there is any thing to be said I will say it I could preach     
 Jan 22 1860  all about the Endowments in Public and the world know Nothing   about it I could preach all about Masonry & None but a mason   know any thing about it And the mane part of Masonry is to keep  a secret.

 Jan 27th 1860  Minutes of A meeting of the Presidency Twelve Presidents of Seventies  and others assembled in President Youngs Council Room at 6 oclok      Thare were Present, President Young President Kimball (D H Wells sick)  All of the Twelve except A. Lyman & G. A. Smith who was sick  The Presidency of the Seventies Bishop Hunter & many others  A Hymn was sung O Happy Souls who pray Prayer By O Hyde  President Young stated the object of the meeting was to convers  upon Doctrinal Points to see if we see alike & think alike I Pray  that we may have the spirit of God to rest upon us that our minds   may be upon the subject & that we may speak by the Holy spirit  He then called upon A Carrington to read a sermon he read  it before the company a peace prepared for the press written by  Orson Pratt upon the Godhead He claimed that it was the   atributes of God that He worshiped and not the person &   that He worshiped those Atributes whether He found them in   God, Jesus Christ Adam, Moses, The Apostles Joseph, Brigham   or in any body Els after the document was read President  Young then called upon the Twelve to express their feelings upon  the subject He called upon O Hyde to speak & he called upon  TJ Taylor to speak He spoke a short time No one knew at  the time (except the President & Carrington) who was the auth[or]  of the document read. Brother Taylor said he did not see   it in that light He worshiped a personage and not the Atributes  he thought God was Located and could not worship the Atributes  in any body. President Young then called a vote of the assembly  and said if you understand this to be a correct doctrin as here  written I wish you manifested it by saying yes No one spoke  President Young then said do I worship Atributes or the  dispenser of those Atributes I worship the Disspencer of those  of those atributes, and Not the Atributes. This is O Pratts sermon  prepared for the Press I do not want to have it published if it is  not right. Brother Orson worships the Atributes of God but not  God I worship not the Atributes but that God who holds and   dispenses if Eternity was full of atributes and No one to dispens  them they would not be worth a feather. Suppose an Angels comes  to us to Night with a message From God and he tels the angels  not to make himself known He comes to us with a message     
 27th 1860  and gives a New Law and a penalty for not obeying you may ask who  are you he may not tell you who he is or he may say God sent  me, you may say whare is that God who sent you I dont know or care  any thing about you or what you say. He might say to you I am a god  to you. Moses said to Israel I am a God to you. Joseph said to us  I am a God to you, this was true and upon the same principles I am   a God to this people & so is any man who is appointed to lead Israel or  the Kingdom of God if the people reject him they reject the one who  sent him but we will let that drop, and turn to the other subjet now   suppose we were all to receive a fullness of the Atributes of God and  According to Orson Pratts Theory The Lord had a fulness and we could  He could not advance but we could advance till we were Equal to him  then if we worshiped the Atributes instead of God we would soon worship  ourselves as soon as we had a fulness of those atributes then you  cannot worship any thing beyound yourself you would then worship  the atributes & not the dispenser of those atributes "this is fals doctrin"  God did not say worship Moses because he was a God to the people, you  may say to your wife or son do so & so, they will say I will not but I   will go to a greater man I will go to Brigham Young, you might say  I am your counciller Dictator or your God Either would be correct  and they should obey your Just & righteous command yet they should  ^not^ worship you for this would be sin. Orson Pratt has differed from  me in many things, But this is a great principle & I do not wish to say  you shall do so and so I do not know of a man who has a mathamat-  ical turn of mind but what goes to Far. The trouble between Orson   Pratt & me is I do not know Enough & he knows to much. I do not  know evry thing their is a mystery concerning the God I worship   which mystery will be removed when I come to a full knowledge  of God. One of the greatest things Joseph Smith ever did was to  Familiarize Heaven & Earth and cause them to shake hand together  and become Familiar together this was a great principle it is sim-  ple yet true. When I me[e]t the gGod I worship I expect to personage  with whom I have been acquainted, upon the same principle that  I would to meet with my Earthly Father after going upon a   Journey & returning home.      W. Woodruff spoke & said that  it is our privelege so to live as to have the spirit of God to bear  record of the Truth of any revelation that comes from God through     
 27th 1860  the mouth of his Prophet who leads his people and it has ever  been a key with me that when The Prophet who leads presents  a doctrin or principle or says thus saith the Lord I make it a point  to received it even if it comes in contack with my tradition  or views being well satisfied that the Lord would reveal the truth  unto his Prophet whom he has called to lead his Church before he  would unto me, and the word of the Lord through the prophet is  the End of the Law unto me. O Hyde & Joseph Young both backed  me up. Joseph Young said "I do not believe in the doctrin of   worshiping the attributes and not the Auther I once loved a woman  she says to me you shall have my respect & kind regards &  she told me to go in peace I told her it was not her good   will that I wanted alone I wanted her. So with my God if   he was to say to me Joseph here take my attributes & go I  would say No Father it is not your attributes alone that I  want but I want you. When I read O Pratts views in the   seer I could not swallow it. Joseph the Prophet said when  you see your Father you will see him Just as he was in this life  ownly he will be full of Strength Glory Immortality & Eternal   life President Brigham Young said now here is the Twelve  I wish to extend there Influence as Far as I can but I cannot  do it while I ^they^ teach Fals doctrin One of the causes of the declartion  in England (as I understand the people are clear down) is what  Orson Pratt Preached in the seer. There is not a man in the   Church that can preach better than Orson Pratt upon any  subject which he understands it is music to hear him but the  trouble is he will preach upon things he does not know any  thing about and tehen he will preach fals doctrin & so will  Elder Hyde, He preaches upon the resurrection & teaches  things which are not true. I will tell you the God  which you and I worship, it is a Being that was on an Earth  like this He has been cloathed in Mortality the same as   we have been and he has had Devils to fight the same as we have had  but I do not expect they were the same Devils that we have. That God  says I am your God and there is none Els let us worship him and none  Els. He is the God that we have. No matter what Gods Enoch saw when  the heavens were opened unto him if the God he saw had been exalted

Smith Chairm[an]   of the Committee on the Constitution Presented a con-  stitution for the State of Deseret which was read twice   by sections then by its title & was adopted by the assembly   as the Constitution of the State of Deseret.       James Ferguson Clairman of the Committee on Memorials   Presented a Memorial to the assembly which was read   and adopted but returned to the Committee to Finish &   prepare it By ingrossing. President Young addressed the   assembly He said I suppose the people will expect a political  speech from me but I shall not say much but this much I   will say, we should guide the people by acts & not by words. I have   been the Govornor of this Territory some Eight years and   every thing has been done that was necessary and all has been   done right all our documents have been got vary corr-  ectly I have had good Clerks around me. We now   are about to step into a State Government. we shall not take   any illegal steps, we are doing Nothing Except what the  Constitution of the United States garuntee unto us, but  we have not felt before to take this step untill now, we   now feel to do it it is our duty and we think we can   maintain a Government. We do not wish to refer to  the past but prepare for the future if the United States will   admit us well if not better it will be all right. we will   not break down the door in order to get in. This is the  ownly people on the Continent who are tru to the Constitution   of the United States Read the Constitution and then say who  is guilty of treason we are the ownly people in the US who is     
 22nd 18612  not guilty of treason. What kill people for there religion and   not be guilty of treason and the whole Nation is guilty of this   Now take your rights and maintain them it is time to do it. you   have chosen me as your Govornor. I have been the governor all the   time of this people and shall be And I will say to you and to   all men that I will not hold this office or officiate in it ownly   as I shall be dictated by the Holy Priesthood of the Son of God.  If you hear any man say that we are not doing right in   Holding a convention & forming a state Government tell them it   is not so, we are doing mothing but what is strictly Constitutio-  nal. We shall be the ownly people that will maintain the Const-  itution while others will break it. We will ask Congress to   admit us into the family of states what if they do not? We have   got a Government and what are they going to do about it   If the Constitution has been carried out it would have hung  President Buchannan and all who were associated with him  in making war upon us. Some want to stay longer to talk  but I am willing the United States should know that we are  capable of doing up important business in a short time mustch  faster than any other people. I like this Constitution. But  what Business has such a sentence in the Constitution that all   men may worship God as they please? what do the people know  about God it would be much more applicable if it said   that all men might make a God of Gold, silver, Brass Iron   wood or stone or of any thing Els and worship that. But   now let us go to and worship God & maintain his kingdom  upon the Earth in the name of Jesus Christ Amen      President Heber C.

Why will Congress shut the door to us because we were  Mormons and they would not do it if this was not the true   Church of Christ. But the days will come when the people   of the United States will seek unto this people for Union  for this people will have a permanent Government Joseph  Smith told what would come to pass. He spoke of this war   said it would begin at South Carolina but He dare   not publish it at First for fear the people would call it  treason. yet it is coming to pass before our Eyes. What is done   here is done by the unanimous voice of all the people. Not  a voice is lifted against it this is an Evidence that it is  right. President Young asked Judge Kinney if He was   willing to have his speech published Judge Kenney said yes   He was willing. President Young said I here want to say a   word upon a principle my text is Election & Reprebation   did Joseph Smith make the war on South Carolina? No He did   not but He foretold it, and that was all he had to do in the matter   Many men can see no difference between foreknowledge &     
 18612  Foreordination. Joseph Smith foreknew the war but He did  not foreordain it S. Rigdon and many others could never  see any difference between the two But the Gods & the prophets  Foreknow things which they do not Foreordain      E. T. Benson Moved that this Convention Do now dissolve      The minutes were read & Excepted      The assembly was dismissed by W. W. Phelps      January 24, 1862 ~ Friday      24 Friday I spent most of the day in the office      January 25, 1862 ~ Saturday      25 I spent the day in the office writing      January 26, 1862 ~ Sunday      26th Sunday I met with my Quorum in the morning Wilford  opened by Prayer & I was mouth I attended meeting at   the Tabernacle. Wm H Folsom Preached  in the morning & Phineas Young & President Brigham   Young in the afternoon. I attended Meeting in the evening  at the 14th ward School House Brother Moody and Comings  Preached followed by Bishop Hoagland.      January 27, 1862 ~ Monday      27th [FIGURES]      One of the most Damniable, Diabolical, Satanical, Helish  Sacraleges has been committed upon the bodies of the  Dead Saints in the burial Ground East of this city and  brought to light this day that was ever known or   recorded in the History of man. Clawson who   was shot dead a few days since while resisting the  officers of Justice He was buried by the Citiesy authorities  some of Clawsons friends obtained permission from   the sextion to take up the bodiesy and remove it to the   Big Cotton Burying ground they took up the coffin  containing the body of Moroni Clawson and when  they opened the coffin they found the corps Naked  which was cloathed when it was buried this led  to a careful inquiry & Examination. Jesse C. Little   the Sexton had imployed a Man b[y] the name of  John Baptiste to dig the graves & bury the dead from   1859 up to the present time the police immediately     
 1862  went to his house and made a serch and they found  many Bundles of graves cloathes about his house in   various parts they also found a large Box filled full  of the clothing of the dead from little infants to the aged of  both sexes. Mr Baptiste was at the grave yard at the  time the poliece went up to him and he was picking up  cobble stones & took him up to the grave of Clawson   and accused him of Robing the dead body He denyed  it but after being choaked a while He confessed it and  then confessed that th he had been robing the dead for  Two and a half years they then took him down to prision  and all of the clothing of the dead found in his possession  was taken to the Court House and there Exhibited so  that any persons who had buried friends since He had  been diging graves might se if they could recognize the  grave clothes Mrs Woodruff & myself went down to  se if we could recognize the grave cloths of Father Woodruff  but we could recognize Nothing as the Aprons were all  destroyed and the robes taken to peaces. There lay the grave  cloths of fifty persons or more some twenty pair of little   childrens stockings and the clothing of all ages male  & female which that man had striped from the dead  Bodies of Saints & sinners. He done his work mostly   nights He had a house nearest to the grave yard so that no  person had detected him in his diabolical work. The anoun-  cement of it to the public created great consternation through  the city. On Being questioned Baptiste acknowledged that   He had been carriying on this Hellish work for three years and  a half his ownly motive was to seell the clothing He said the  devil was in him which I think was true      January 28, 1862 ~ Tuesday      28th The Policce took up Baptiste to the grave yard to day  to point out the graves which He had opened. But there were  many persons in the Grave yard who felt Exasperated in there feelings   and He did not point out more than a doz graves which  He had opened for fear he would be killed. No Estimate   can be made of the Number of the dead He has robed     
 1862  I would probably range from One to three Hundred some  10 graves were opened to day several of them were found robed  He gave a list of some 15 Names which he had robed of late  some of those graves have been opened & the bodies found   Naked. John Baptiste was Born in Venace in 1814. What will  be done with the man I do not know      It was afterwords reported that John Baptist was branded in  the forehead as A Robber of the dead, & croped & placed upon   Millers Island, & he undertook to cross onthe Lake on a frail  Raft & was drowned as supposed as he never was heard  of after. He robed the dead in Australia to such an Extent  that he built a methodist meeting house with the avails of his  robery so he testified.      January 27, 1862 ~ Monday      27 I met at 1 oclok at the 17 ward school House to attend  the meeting of the Jordon Irrigation Company for the purpose  of the organization of the company.

 February 1, 1862 ~ Saturday      Feb 1st 1862  I spent most of the day in the Office      February 2, 1862 ~ Sunday      2nd Sunday I met with my Quorum in the morning. I attended   Meeting in the Tabernacle through the day President Young   Preached in the forenoon upon Temporal things. He wished  the People to get up their ox teams now the ground was  frozen and draw rock for the Temple so the Stone Masons   could be kept Employed. He wished to send 300 teams  or 1200 yoakke of Oxen to the States next spring to  bring up the poor and Machinery to this valley He wished  the people who had Means to unite & send to the States &  buy twenty Carding Machines, and spining Ginneys  we also want more Nail Factories. We want a Machine   that will cut 20 penny nails and we want much Machinery  in this Territory to be prepared to live within ourselves &  make all we consume for our trade will soon be cut off  from the Nations. I intend to send for a Machine to  Make cards He treated mostly upon these subjects. In the   Afternoon H. S. Eldridge spoke followed by Lorenzo Young   & President Heber C. Kimball who spoke upon the same  subjects. I met with G. A. Smith & F. D. Richards at 5 oclk  for Prattyer. We agreed that when any one of the Quorum  of the Twelve were present at our time of prayer if he was  alone He should go and dress and pray at the Altar as a  representative of the Quorum. W.

But as to the punishment of the man to shoot or hang  the man would not satisfy my feelings at all, it came to my  mind when I first herd of it, if I should unDertake to punish  him at all I would want to crop him & then print with   India ink upon his forehead (croped for robing the dead)  2nd discourse was making dancing Halls of our schools & meeting  Houses. I am opposed to it Dancing and Theaters is no part   of my religion this is by permission but I do not want them  amalgamated. 3rd Attendtion paid to Females some Females  complain that there is not attention Enough paid to them in   this community But I will say that there is no community on  Earth where as much respect & attention is paid to Females as  in this Church. Every old woman thinks she must go to Every  party, and Many a first wife thinks she should be a Queen   and the rest of the wives surfs. But this I do not Believe in  4th We cannot get the Telegraphic News printed under a   day or two after it comes I Believe Elias Smith is writing his own History

February 11, 1862 ~ Tuesday      11 I spent this day in the office Journalizing I held a meeting  in the Evening with the Jordor Irrigation Company upon the   Buy laws of the company. We got a long Telegraphetic dispatch   printed which gives an account of the war      February 12, 1862 ~ Wednesday      12 I spent the day in the office on the Buy laws of the Joordan   Irrigation Company & Journalizing      [FIGURE] A Lecture of W. Woodruff in the Seventies Hall   Upon History and Journallizing on the evening of Feb 12.   I met at the 70 Hall at 7 oclok to deliver a lecture according  to appointment the Hall was crouded to overflowing and   Hundreds Had to leave who could not get into the House the   following is a synopsis of my lecture      Brethren and Sisters I feel Happy in meeting with you   in this capacity. I think it more profitable for the saints to   meet together to hear lectures delivered upon the arts & scien-  ces and various principles than to spend so much time in   danceing and light amusement. The subject which I wish   to speak upon this Evening is Journalizieing & History this   subject Embraces a wide Field far greater than I shall   attempt to Explore this Evening. History is given under  two general Heads viz Sacred and profane and as spiritual   and temporal things are inseparably connected, so is sacred   & profane History many times is vary closely connected  together. We have but vary little History in the Early ages   of the world Either Sacred or Profane, and but vary few His-  torians or Journalists in any age of the world when     
 1862  compared with other callings & avocations of life. I shall  not say much upon profane History during this Evening I will  However refer to one or two prominent Historians. Rollins  compiled an Elaberate History of the ancient Medes, Persians   Asyrians, Babylonians, & Caldeans. He gives a History of their   government customs Literature & Laws but more Esspecially   of their wars. I would recommend this History for our   yound [young] men to read who wish to become acquainted with an-  cient History. I would also recommend the reading of Josepheus   the great Jewish Historian it appears to me that no man can   read with indiference His account of the siege of Jerrusalem  by the Roman Army the destruction of their city & Temple their  captivity & dispersion among the Gentiles Nations. Here in the   siege of Jerrusalem over one million of Jews perished inby the sword   famine, pestilence, & fire. I would also refer to the History of Greece   & Rome & Modern Europe & America or the History of any   Nation and ask how have we obtained the History of those  Nations, Kingdom & Countrys. you may say that Historians   have handed those things down unto us, But How have Historians   obtained materials from which to compile therire History?  I answer From the scribes, reporters, & Journalists who wrote   day by day Events as they passed before there Eyes and this   class of men forms the foundation of all History and from   there Material, Historians who live hundreds of years after  Events transpire will compile History. But without material  Historians cannot make History or any thing Else.      I will call your attention to what is called sacred or Bibli-  cal History. Moses wrote the first five Books viz J##Genesis## ##Exodus|Exiodus##   ##Leviticus##, ##Numbers##, & ##Deuteronomy|Dieuteronomy##. But He gives but vary little   History of the Early ages of man. We have a revelation in the   ##Doctrine and Covenants 107:53-54|doctrins & covenants## page 79 which says that "three years before   the death of Adam He called Seth, Enos, Cainan, Mahalaleel,  Jared Enoch & Methuselah all who were High Priests with  the residue of his posterity who were righteous into the valley  of Adam Ondi Ahman and there bestowed upon them his   last Blessing and the Lord appeared unto them and they rose     
 1862  "Up & blessed Adam and called him Michael the Prince the   Archangel and the Lord administered comfort unto Adam  and said unto him I have set thee to be at the Head a multitude of  Nations shall come of thee and thou art a prince over them   forever." "And Adam stood up in the midst of the congregation  and Notwithstanding he was bowed down with age being full of   the Holy Ghost predicted whatsoever should befall his posterity  unto the latest generation."  [##Doctrine and Covenants 107:55-56##]THere was Adam and seven   of his sons all Aged Patriarchs who lived over nine   hundred years Except Mahalealel who lacked five years   of Being Nine hundred years of age. [##Genesis 5:16##] Enoch was 365 years of   age when he was Translated. [##Genesis 5:23##] Here was that great & glorious   meeting of those old Patriarchs and all the History we have of it  those great Prophesies of Adam concerning what should   befal his posterity to the End of time is given to us in a few  lines whare is there a latter day Saints who would not be   glad to read the Journal & History of that great Event.      Abramham and the later Patriarchs & Prophets have left   to the world by there Journals and sacred records some  History of the dealings of God with them. But there records  were kept upon parchment & papyrus written in  Egyptian, Arabic, Chaldecic and Hebrew, mingled with   many Hieroglyphics in order to convey their ideas &   principles to future generations, some of which have   been translated into the English language by the order   of King James which now forms the Bible. But what   a small History the Bible is of the dealings of God for   4000 years with the Nations of the Earth.      Christ Came in the meridian of time to Esstablish the gospel   & Kingdom of God upon the Earth. He organized the Church, chose   Twelve Apostles also Seventies & set the Church in order with   all the gifts graces and blessings. He administered the ordinances  of the gospel, wrought many miracles and finished the work He  was sent to do. But Jesus Christ with all the saints had to contend   with the world the flesh and the devel & Jew & Gentile and   the world overcome them and put them to death and the Church     
 1862  of Christ disappeared with that generation. What is the History  of that generation? it is vary short. The four Evangelist   Mathew,  Mark, Luke & John, gives the History Biirth life and   death of the sSaviour. as near as we can learn Luke kept  the Journals & done most of the writing He recorded the Acts   of the Apostles. Then Paul wrote his Epistles to the various   churches. Then James wrote one short Epistles. Then Peter   wrote two short Epistles about as much as one of our   reporters would write in one short discourse. Then Jude   wrote one short chapter. Then John the Revelator when  he was Banished to the Isle of Patmos under the reign   of Domician Cezar wrote his Revelations [##Revelation 1:9##] after He was   recalled under the reign of Nervya He wrote his three   Epistles. this maks 8 writers in the New Testament  and there testimony was vary limited, also their writings   as far as they have come to us, at least when we take into  consideration the great work which they performed      The ancient Jaredites and Nephites who inhabited this con-  tinent were commanded of God to write their history upon   Brass & Gold Plates which were hid up in the Earth to come forth   in our day to be translated by the Prophet Joseph through the power  of God for the benefit of the Saints. This forms the Book of Mormon   and is the purest translation of ancient records that we  have any knowledge of upon Earth yet this record gives but   a limited Idea of the dealings of God with that People yet  what we have obtained was by strict commandment of God.      But let us turn our thoughts a moment to our own day. I   need not tell you that this is the kingdom of God, Esstablished  by God Himself which is to take the place of all other kingdoms   upon Earth and we are the People Ordained of God to Esstab-  lish his kingdom upon the Earth, build up Zion and prepare  the way for the coming of Jeussus Christ. Now should we  not keep a Journal, Record, & History of the dealings   of God with [us] as they transpire day by day before our Eyes?   we should. This Church & Kingdom is organized in all   the fulness of the Holy Priesthood necessary for the     
 1862  accomplishment of the work of God in this great   and last dispensation of the fulness of times the   Church of Christ has been Esstablished in our day  with Prophets, Apostles, Evangelists, Patriarchs, High Priests   Elders, Bishops, Priests, Teachers, Deacons, Gifts, graces  Revelations and with all the ordinances Necessary for   the salvation of the children of ^men^. Joseph Smith was the   the first Apostle, Prophet, Seer, & Revelator called in   these last days He brought forth the Book of Mormon   and organized the Church of Christ as he was com-  manded by the Revelations of Jesus Christ. When  the Twelve Apostles were chosen & ordained The   Prophet Joseph gave them strict instruction to keep a record  of there procedings (see the History of the Church Feb 1835)   The following Extract) "Since the Twelve are now appointed   & chosen I wish to tell them a course which they may   pursue and be benefitted in one point of light of which  perhaps they are not now aware. At all times when  you assemble in the capacity of a council to transact   business let the oldest preside and let one or more be appo-  inted to keep a record of your proceedings, and on the  decision of Every important decission item let it be what it may  let such descision be noted own and they will ever afterwords   remain upon record as LAW, Covenant, & doctrin.      Questions thus decided might at the time appear unimportant  but should they be recorded and one of you lay hands upon   them afterwards you might finds them of infinate worth  not ownly to your Brethren but a feast to your own souls"       Many other remarks were made at the same time. The Prophet   Joseph always recommended the priesthood to keep a rec-  ord of all their Official acts, and among his last letters to   the Church before he was slain he urges upon the Church   to be particular in there records of the Baptizesms for   the dead to be vary particular in there records of there   official acts, that what they bound on Earth should be bound  in heaven and what they loosed on Earth should be loosed     
 1862  in heaven. and what you record on Earth shall be recorded  in Heaven. President Brigham Young has also carried out the   same Principle since He has been president of the Church, in all   of our ordinances, Endowments, sealings and official acts He  wishes us to be particular in recording the same. This Church  is organized with a presidency of 3 men the Twelve Apostles  also 63 Quorums of Seventies 4,410, Apostles & many thousands  of High Priests, Elders, Bishops, Priests, Teachers, & Deacons. all   should keep a Journal of the dealings of God with them and  there officials acts, and keep a true History of Events in this   great dispensation. I was inspired & moved upon to write a  Journal & keep a record of the affairs of this Church from the  time I first Joined this Church up to the Presient time. I seldom  Ever heard the Prophet Joseph, or Brigham Young or the Apostles  teach preach or Prophesy or perform any official act but  what I have recorded it imn my Journals unless some other   persons were recording the same, and I could not feel Easy  untill I had accomplished it. I have written more sacred  History of the teaching of the prophets & Apostles & official acts  of the Latter day Sants than would make several Testiments  as large as the one Handed down to us by the Ancient Apostles   I have kept a Journal of almost Evry day of my life since   I have been a member of this Church. By refering to my Journals   I could tell Each day what I have done, the company I have been   in, and what was transpiring around me, and any council and   Teaching From the Presidency or Twelve Except whare I know   there were reporters recording the same. I have urged this same   course upon the Twelve & the other Quorums of the Church to keep   a record of there meetings & the dealings of God with them and   for all men who bear the Holy Pristhood to keep a record of   their lives or Esspecially of there official Acts, in the Church  and kingdom of God. Some may say this is a great deal of  trouble But we should not call any thing trouble which brings   to pass good. I consider that portion of my life which has been   spent in keeping Journals & writing History to have been vary   profitably spent. For instance the Lord gives unto us the Holy     
 1862  Priestood and we are sent on a mission to the Nations of  the Earth, we go & Preach the gospel & bring many into the church   and the Power of the Holy Ghost rest upon us. We heal the  sick, cast out devils, command the Elements & they obey  us & the Lord gives unto us dreams visions & Revelations  and many Blessings should we not have respect Enough  to gGod to make a record of those Blessings which He pours  out upon us and Our official acts which we do in his  name upon the face of the Earth? I think we should.      For an Example we Embrace in our faith the belief that  the Ten Tribes of Israel will return from the North Country  unto Zion in the last days suppose that those Israelites should  come to Zion in our day Led by the Holy Prophets of God  what would be one of the first questions we would ask   them? it would be, whare are your records? show is [us]   your History we want to read an account of the dealings  of the Lord with you since you were led away under  Shalmanezar king of Asyria [##2 Kings 18:9-11##] But what would be  our disappointment if they should ^say^ O we have not   kept any record or account of the great & mighty works  of God among our tribes for many generations, we   have herd our Fathers say that thet Lord had done many  great & marvelous works in there day we have also had   great Blessings while on our Journey to Zion from the North  Country. The mountains o Ice flowed down before us and   there was a Highway cast up for us to walke in as there was  to Israel when they came out of Egypt into the land of Cainan  [##Joshua 3:16-17##] and the Nations Trembled at our presence but we did not keep  a record of these things we did not think any body would  be particularly interested in it but ourselves. should we not  be greatly disappointed at such information? we should &  so would it be with them when they come to Zion & Enquire  for the History of this church & kingdom if we were to tell  them that we had not kept any History of the rise & progress  of the Church. But instead of neglecting this branch of our  work let Evry man who can keep a Journal & record     
 1862  Events as they pass before our Eyes day by day, this will make a valua-  ble legacy to our children as and well a great Benefit to future gener-  ations by giving them a true History of the rise & progress of   the Church & Kingdom of God upon the Earth in this last dispen-  sation instead of leaving it to our Enemies to write a fals History  of the true Church of Christ. Brethren and sisters we are making  History Every day let that History be good let us do the works of  righteousness that when our acts are recorded we shall be satisfied  with them Either in time or Eternity I ask these Blessings in the  Name of Jesus Christ Amen      I was followed by Judge Phelps who read two chapters of his new   translation from the bible he made some remarks upon his Early days      February 13, 1862 ~ Thursday      13 I spent the day in the office      February 14, 1862 ~ Friday      14 I spent the day in the office. In the Evening I attended the lectures  at the 70' Hall. Orrelius Miner gave a lecture upon Law spoke over   an hour He was followed by Hosea Stout upon Politics. He was   followed by Judge Kenny who spoke rather more upon the   gospel than any thing Els. He said the Municiple Law the Judges  & Lawyiers were all an Evil in community perhaps a Necessary  Evil. thought if we would preach morality instead of Law it would be better      February 15, 1862 ~ Saturday      15.

 Dec 2nd 1857  a late Hour. Brothers Groove and Southworth who had   been kept prisioners for some two weeks in the Enemies camp   arived home to day. Brother Grove called upon President Young  and related what He knew in the Enemies camp I had a   conversation with Brother Southworth concerning his impri-  sionment and He said that He was taken prisioner on Green   River by an officer in Capt Cooks Horse company &   put under Guard with orders for the guard to shoot him if   He got 5 paces from him He travelled under guard in this   way untill He got to the main Encampment He was then put   with the main prisioners of the camp & guarded with the mess  He came up with Howard Livingston. He wished Mr Livingston   to intercede with Col Johnsoton to let him go home to his family   as they had nothing against him ownly that He was a Mormon  But Mr Livingston would do nothing for him He reports that   their is much of the spirit of Desertion in the camp the   officers treat their soldiers in a cruel manner. Capt Cook   is considered a Cruel Tyrant & several of his soldiers said   ^said^ they would kill him if they had a chance, several soldiers   talked with southworth & said they would desert if they  could. He said the greatest amount of any one article in camp   was ardent spirits He thought there were 100 waggon loads  Howard Livingston had an outfit of Liquor which cost   him ten thousand dollars worth at first cost, and that all the   Armey had a great amount as well as all the Suttler's the officers   were drunk evry day. He said their was but 2 companies at Bridger   guarding that place & thought 100 men could go in the night &   take all their was in that Fort. they were 5 days moving their   train 6 miles they had not animals enough to move one third  of their train at the same time and they lost 60 of their best   mueles while moving that distance. He says their is a division of   the officers as well as the soldiers a portion of them think   that Govornor Young is Justified in taking the course He does in   his own Defence. He said Col Allexander was an old Granny the  Govornor Cummings was a whiskey tub, in appearance about such   a man as Brother Blazzard would be if He drank a quart of   whiskey per day. Their Animals are dying so fast that they   all expect to be on foot before next spring they have sent   capt Marcy to Taos to buy mules Horses & oxen the expedit-  ion is entirely closed this season and made an Entire faleure   of it as far as they are concerned      Reflections      We can now clearly see the Hand of God made visably bear   in our behalf concerning the campaign of our Enemies against   us this season past. The American Government with James Bucannan   at their head as president, have sent forth An Armey   of 2,500 men fully armed and Equipt for war for the sole   purpose of destroying the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter   Day Saints & the Kingdom of God from off the Earth. This   Church and kingdom of God has been driven from the  midst of the people in the United States into the vallies of the   Rocky Mountains a thousand miles from the confines     
 o Dec 2nd   of what is called Gentile Civilization whare they were   in hopes we would perish but as soon as they found that   we would live & prosper they became alarmed & were   resolved upon our destruction and Hence they send their  armies out to accomplish their Hellish purpose as soon   as it was known unto us President Brigham Young the   prophet seer and Revelator & leader of the Church and   kingdom of God Rose up in the strength of Israel God   and proclaimed Israel Free and said they should be   Free from that hour if they would obey his council   & follow his preceps. His councillors Heber C Kimball   & Daniel H Wells and also the Quorum of the Twelve   Apostles backed up his Testimony & sustained him in   his decissions And all the people said Amen so let it   be. President Young testified unto the people in the name   of God if they would be United with him in their faith   prayers & works that the Enemy Should not have   power to come into our valley that the Lord would hedge   up their way & we should not be called to shed their   Blood neither should they have power to shed ours  This principle president Young has taught from day to  day when their was evry prospet that the Enemy would   try to come. From two to three thousand of the servants   of God armed themselves & went into the mountains acco-  rding to the council of President Young & they were lead   by the valient & Noble General Daniel H Wells to Hedge   up the way of the Enemy should they attempt to come  in they formed large Entrenchments & ditches & pilled  up large masses of Rocks in narrow passes so as to   roll them down upon the Enemy & destroy them should  they attempt to Come in. But as the Prophets Brigham   & Heber had said so it came to pass the Lord fought   our Battles & hedged up the way of our Enemies when   they Got on Hams Fork 150 miles from our City the   storms & cold killed their Horses, Mules, & Cattle by Hun-  dreds so that when the whole armey got together with   the Govornor & Judges who had been sent by the   Government to rule & tyranize over us they had not   got team enough left alive to draw one third of   their trains so they are obliege to stop & spend the  winter in the storms of the mountains & their wisdom   is taken away so that they are not capable of writing   a letter or Document in a proper manner and this   the Lord has done in answer to the prayers of his Saints  and our brethren have been enabled to Heard them like  a herd of cattle & they have shot grape musket & minnie   balls at them from time to time & those Balls have flown   like hail around the servants of God & not a drop of   Blood shed neither have the Brethren returned the   fire upon the Enemy in no instance. Fear has so rested   upon the Enemy that they would flee into their main body   at the approach of a small number of our Brethren & thus  has the Lord Frustrated the Enemy in all their designs     
 Dec 2nd  against us up to this day & through this whole sceneery of   alarm of war & the approach of the Enemy President Young   has been as calm & scerene as a Mays summers morning  and all the time has said victory would be hours & that  Blood would not be shed & he has diffused ^this same spirit^ throughout the  whole Church & kingdom of God esstablished in these mounta-  ins and all the armies of Zion have gone out to war as   calm & composed as though they were going into the field  to their daily labour & now the Armies are returning  out of the mountains of snow to their homes with the  same spirit of composure & quietude as they went out  thanking God that the words of the prophets have been   fullfilled in their behalf & as they pass thby the Habitation   of President Young they give him a quiet salute & pass   on in silence to their homes Hewhile He gazes upon the  passing Army of Zion with a Heart filled to overflowing   with thanksgiving & praise to the God of Israel who had   fulfilled his words which he had been inspired by the   Holy Ghost to utter unto his brethren & was also thankful   that He was surrounded with Brethren who were servants   of God & were united to gether in faith & love to carry   out his instruction & thereby claim the protection &   Blessings of Almighty God upon them, as He walks through  the city under the sable shades of night he beholds &   feels the diferent between the Army of Zion & the camp of   the wicked. Hundreds of men who have just returned from  the Armey of Israel in the mountains arive in the city in  the city in the night, camp by the road side, have been  two months in the mountains of cold & snow not a   murmer is heard to escape their lips, or the sound of   Blasphemy, or oath, or filthy language, or contention   one with an other. No one reeling under strong drink  but kindness quietiude & Joy filles evry heart & the  spirit of God fills evry bosom. This contrast is vary  great when compared with the Gentile armies & cities      After I returned to my house and about to return to  rest I heard a nock at my door I Bid the visiter come  in when Brother Robert Scholes appeared my hiered   man He had been in the mountains two months with   my Horses in the Army He started at midnight the   night before & had traveled all the latter part of the   night & through the day, many of the men had given out   & the horses had to draw a heavy load of them      December 3, 1857 ~ Thursday      3rd This is Fast day I attended meeting at the 14th ward  school house a part of the day & spoak to the people a short   time I told them the Lord had fulfilled the words of President  Brigham Young by stoping our enemies & not giving them  power to come in without our sheding their Blood or they sheding  ours the Lord had fought our Battles &c. I spent the   evening in the office     
 December 4, 1857 ~ Friday      Dec 4th 1857  The Calafornia Mail arived last evening we find from  the Calafornia papers that the massacre of the Emigrants in   the south by the Indians is laid to the mormons the people in   Loss Angel held public meeting & passed Resolutions to call on   the President of the United States to exhert his power to  bring the murderers to Justice all the saints in Calafornia   are returning home Brother Cannon got out a half sheet   of the Standard their is quite a stir concerning Mormon-  ism.

Brother Wells said that Brother Maxfield had the command   of a small scouting party they took a horse from the Enemy &   was fired at by the Enemy, but no one hurt they went back to   their encampment. Brother Maxfield had an impression that   their was Danger in their path and ought to leave their camp  He told his Brethren so but some of them did not think so &   all went to Bed But these feelings increasing upon Brother   Maxfield He arose from his bed & told his Brethren He was   agoing to leave that place immediately & they all gathered   up their Horses and went several Miles Back & camped for   the night & soon the Encampment which they had Just   left was surrounded by a Hundred men & had it not been   for their warning they would probably have been all   taken prisioners. President Young said concerning the   Enemy I know they will begin to waste away before spring   and I think they will get orders to return back. If they   attempt to come in Col Johnson will ride the best Horse He can   get & will say to Col Allexander & Cook & the other officers now  you go ahead now you had better all get killed than to loose   your next president thinking that He would stand a chance to  be President.      I accompanied Brother Woolley to his ward   & preached to a large congregation was followed by D Spencer   & E Snow. I spoke upon the kingdom of God now esstablished, & its  finally distiny. D Spencer spoke of our Educating our Children & E Snow   of Family Government said some men would deal honorably with  Brigham Young & cheat their nearest Neighbor.

Snow      Eliza had I the talent of a Poet, or the gifts which thou  Hast I would write to Thee and spread my thoughts on paper,  But like Anthony I am a plain blunt man. What I have to  say I speak right on without any regard to the Poets measure   or rhyme, or law, or order; Thou hast spread thy thoughts  on Paper for men to read: I have read them many an   hour, they have stired my soul with thoughts, deep thoughts,  thoughts which could not be born. Thy soul hath been   inspired with the spirit of God, and Eternal light and truth   and Noble sentiment and God has given thee gifts to utter  them. Thy lamp hath been lit at Gods Holy altar whare   the oil was pure and the spirit free so thou couldst weigh  Eternal truth and tell it unto men. Why hath this talent   this choice gift been given unto thee Eliza. Ah the spirit whispers  it was to cheer the heart of aA Prophet A Patriarch, An Apostle  in the dark hours of Gloom. It was to give the Lords Anointed  a ray of light, and a consoleing thought while Hells dark Billows   rolled around in the midst of wicked men and Devils who continually  cry out and say that no kingdom on the Earth shall belong   to God. [FIGURE] It was to tell the assassins of Missouri and Illinois   in streams of Living fire that the Judgments of God awaited  their guilty souls and that there Judgment had begun. It was  to tell the wicked Nation who now Pollute the sacred soil of   Joseph that when their cup was full they would find a   grave there to remain untill called to Judgment by the trump   of God. Hast thou not been faithful in thy mission to Earth. Yes  the spirit whispers Yes. Many an hour has Joseph spent in gloom  and sorrow because of Fals Brethren and wicked men, even the  hearts of the saints were so barred by fals tradition that He   could not unbosom his soul in the House of his Friends. This caused  him pain. Then thou dist comfort him. Thy frendly thoughts  and acts and words inspired by Gods Eternal truth was like  a flaming shaft though launch by a female hand, that hand  was nerved by faith and power that it pierced the walls of  Darkness fear and death and gave the Prophet Joy. But who  can tell the best deeds of a true friend in time of need, None  They are not told in time, but like gold in the mine are   concealed from vhuman view, if known at all the Judgment  must reveal them. Thou hast been a true Friend and com-  forted the Heart of Joseph, Hiram, Brigham, Heber, Willard,  Jedediah, Thy Brother Lorenzo and thousands of the saints I need   not name them. Thy words and testimony will live and speak  in flames of Holy fire to inspire the Hearts of Prophets Apos-  tles and Holy men of God to noble Deeds, and steal [steel] the nerve   of many a Noble Son of Zion. to avenge the Blood of the Prophets   and martyrs of Jesus Christ, long after thou art with thy Father  in heaven clothed with Immortality and crowned with Light  Thy Pen hath pierced many a wicked withheart with barbed   darts which no Earthly power could remove. Thou hast freely  told the wicked their doom and warned them of approaching  Judgment. Thy garment are clear of the Blood of all men.     
 Thy testimony will remain on histories page and be   numbered among the prophets of God as one of the noble spirits  whom God has sent through the Loins of Abraham and Joseph  to fulfill a Noble mission upon the Earth in the last dispensation   and fulness of times. God Bless Thee Noble Muse. Thy soul  is as pure as the criystleal stream that flows from its snowy   bed. Out of the Heart the mouth speaketh. The thoughts of   thy soul are before the world to read Let them read. It will   live when they are Dead. Continue to let the inspiration   of thy soul be given unto men. Haste thy mission here upon   Earth. For Eloheam, Jehovah, Michael Angels seraphs Apostles   Prophets Thy Father and Mother Brethren and sisters await thy   coming with Joy. Thou hast been true and faithful and   art sealed unto Eternal life and secured unto thyself a Crown   of glory. No Power shall take it. It awaits thy coming  Soon this Blessing will be thine. Ah what Joy what consolation  who can comprehend it None but a saint. Soon will thou Enjoy   this Blessing. Did I say soon, Yes not because I expet thee to  leave us. But shouldst thou remain to see Zion Redeemed  (which ma^y^ God grant) and her Enemies conquered and sin and   sinners find a grave, and Zions Land be cleansed and the   Temple of our God in Jackson County be reared, clothed with   the Power of God, with her towreers marked with a pillar of fire  by night and a cloud by day, And the way prepared for the coming   of the Son of Man, it will be soon.

 December 21, 1857 ~ Monday      Dec 21st  Monday I met with the Legislative council most of the time in the   Joint session. Resolutions were offerd upon the merits of the Govornors   Message which resolutions were like a Declaration of independance   against wicked and ungodly men this drew speeches from John Taylor   G. A. Smith W. Woodruff O. Hyde, H. Stout, Bishop Rowberry J. C. Litle  W W Phelps &c many interesting remarks were made G A. Smith   said it was a grave question before us and one of vast import   if we carry out these resolutions we may prepare our necks   for the Halter if our Enemies catch us I am in for the measure   because it is right the United States are determined to destroy   the Mormons if it is in their power but we have to defend our-  selves. In the remarks which I made I said I did not think   their ever was an Assembly of men on Earth that deliberated   upon so weighty a subject upon which hung such important   consequences with the same feeling which pervades the boso-  ms of this assembly. for all that we possess in this life inclu-  ding all our lives are couched in this important subjet yet   evry mind is calm and serene and not a disenting vote or   voice, why is this, when Our Fathers set in solumn   convention upon the subject of our Declaration of Independance   they knew well that their cause was just, yet it required   the strongest talent and argumet and language was exherted   to bring that august body of senators to agree as a unit   in putting their names to that sacred instrument; ^the^ speech   of sir Patrick Henry was a masterly Effort of talent   & oritory upon that solumn occasion. It does not require   any argument with this body of men to convince them what   course to persue, what causes this difference they were   inspired by the Lord to step forth to esstablish an   Independant Government in America, but this body of   Men are far more inspired by the same God to esstablish   the Kingdom of God upon the Earth and lay a foundation   for the Liberty and salvation of our children and to   lift up a standard for the oppressed of all nations   Our path is marked out as plain asto our view as is our broad   street or the missippii River to the natural Eye. The same God  who inspired our Fathers to esstablish a Free government  said through the prophet Joseph Smith that if ever the constitu-  tion of the United States or its principles were ever preserved   it would have to be done by the Church of Jesus Christ of   Latter Day Saints even the servants of God Holding the Holy   priesthood. that day has now come & the day is dawning when   we are called to act the same God who has destroyed two   Nations who have dwelt upon this continent because of   their iniquity, has also said that all other Nations who   should occupy this continant when they were ripened in   iniquity should in like manner be cut off from the earth  and not left to pollute the Land of Joseph or the Land of  Zion I do not know what Els our Nation can do in order  in order to fill up their cup of iniquity than what they   have done and are doing. I do not know of any other key   the United States can turn to seal fast their condemnation   than the Exertions which they are makeing to destroy the saints   of God for their religion I am in For the measure because it is right

I have been troubled for   several days with severe pain in one of my Eye teeth I had taken  cold & it had setled in my Jaw & tooth and it was swoolen &   much inflamed. I called upon a Dentist and had it pulled   as soon as He pulled it my Mouth filled with Blood He gave   me a cup of cold water to rens my mouth I spit out the   Blood & filled my mouth with cold water it struck my   brain numb like a stroak of the Palsey for a few seconds the   then the numness left me and at each beat of the pulse a   [FIGURE] A Pain went through my Brain like an Arrow   or a thunder bolt for the term of two hours untill it appeared   as though my head would burst. This pain continued in my   head untill I covered my head with hot potatoe poultice & got   into a high state of perspiration. I never before heard of an instance   of this kind. I reason upon it thus that it being an Eye tooth   & taking cold water into my mouth before the goum had closed  the water chilled the nerve runing from the thooth through the Eye   to the Brain and the cold Blood was instantly carried to the   Brain which created a concussion which was both excruciating   and dangerous had the water been warm instead of cold no  such effect would have been produced. Let surgeon & Dentist observe   this rule when pulling Eye teeth use warm water instead of cold      December 24, 1857 ~ Thursday      24 I spent the day in the office on the Dr papers mostly & scraping      December 25, 1857 ~ Friday      25th Christmast I spent the day in the office writing Journal   & History it was vary quiet in the streets through the day  I had a supper at my own house and spent the evening with my   children in an agreeable manner      December 26, 1857 ~ Saturday      26th I heard an Early report this morning that the socil Hall was   on fire I soon went over and found the room occupied   by the Legislative ACouncil nearly burned up and a part of   the chairs it smoaked up the whole House it will cost several   Hundred dollars to repair it I spent the day in the office on History      December 27, 1857 ~ Sunday      27th Sunday I attended meeting at the Tabernacle.

I met in council with the board of Directors   of the Agricultural society heard a report of the treasurer and   prepared an article for the press      I looked over my Journal during the year AD 1857   A synopsis of which will be found on the following page      Thus ends another Years eighteen hundred and fifty eightseven   has past and gone to return no more forever, it has borne its report   to heaven of all men and Nations, it has been an important year  to Zion and the world 1857 will be the year on histories   page which will be dated the commencement of the downfall of   the United States. For it is during this year that they have ent-  ered the field as the open Enemies & persecuters of the saints   of the Most High God and have sent an Armey of 2500 men   1000 miles for the purpose of laying a foundation for the destruc-  tion of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints called   Mormons whoave have setled in the great Bason of North   America called Utah Territory or the State of Deserett  Here is esstablished the Kingdom of God as Daniel saw it by   vision, and the people of the United States are Determined to   destroy the kingdom of God from off the Earth. For these things  the Judgments of God will now begin to rest more fully upon   that Nation and will be increased upon them year by year   untill they are broaken up and wasted away from under Heaven   and cease to become a Nation and this calamity will begin   to come spedily upon them. And they will be visited with  thunder, lightning, storm, whirl winds, Earthquakes floods, pestilence   plagues, war and Devouring fire and the wicked will slay the wicked   slay the wicked untill the Nation wais wasted away and broaken up

Of course I cannot give council to those  over me But it did look like a dangerous  course to take the [JP] at Ogden following the  reward with his Photoes scattered through the  County. Still any other Route might have  been as dangerous. It seems that Brother  Snow run a Narrow risk before he crossed  the Line into Mexico. It appear that all  the Rail Roads are watched and Marshals on  the watch in Calafornia to guard the different  routs to Mexico & the Islands. It seems to  be dangerous work to try to get out of the  County by any R. R.

 Salt Lake City,  June 30, 1883.    President John Taylor and Counsellors  George Q. Cannon and Joseph F. Smith.    Dear Brethren in the Lord—    At a  meeting, of six of the Twelve Apostles and  four of the First Presidents of Seventies,  held this day it was unanimously agreed  to submit for your consideration the name  of Christian Daniel Fjeldsted of Logan,  but now presiding over the Scandinavian  Mission, and who is a member of the 57th  Quorum of Seventies, as, to the best of our knowl-  edge and judgment, the most suitable person  to fill the vacancy in the Council of first  presidents of Seventies, occasioned by the  death of our beloved brother Elder John  Van Cott.    Yours in the love of the Gospel,  W. Woodruff, President of Twelve,  H. S. Eldredge, Prest. of Council of Seventies.  F. D. Richards—Clerk of Council.    approved J. T 
 of Mormon in the Spanish language is much  needed in the Mexican Mission and among sev-  eral of the larger tribes of Lamanites who speak  more or less that language.    As this is a labor that will require some  length of time to perform, we shall be thankful  to learn your conclusion as early as may suit  your convenience that, if favorable, Elder Thatcher  may get soon at the work.    In the love of the Gospel and on behalf  of the Council.    W. Woodruff  President.    F. D. Richards  Clerk.

 Stanley Buildings, Bath Street Liverpool  Aug 5th 1845    Beloved Brother Pratt    I recieved your letter  some time since but have delayed untill Sister  Beer's return as I could then forward by private  conveyance. Elder Clark was with me ths afternoon  I read him your letter he says you left a bill for him  & Felding to pay at Carns & [Borown] which they paid according  to agreement. But he said there was No arangements  made with him about the flour. He says as far as their  was any arrangements made with him about any business he  attended to it, but what was left with Br Fielding he  could not say anything about. I also read the lettr to Br  Ward and he did not know of any business left with him  but what he had attended to. It seems you left the payment  of the flour with Fielding but he has not attended to it  I do not know of any debts now standing against you  in this country but the flour the names of the last  that were shiped that had paid you were William Gittins  & family they claimed £16.16.0 which was allowed them in  their passage.    I spoke to Br Brown about his Box of hard ware  that he shiped to you & I believe he has written  for somebody els to pay duties & sell it for what it  will fetch. I dont think myself that you ought to be  troubled with things of that kind. The Acada brought  me papers from Nauvoo the first No of the New York Messenger  two letters from Boston, one from Eldr Grant of Philadelphia 
 & one from my Father in Connecticut all of which I  was glad to get as they contained much good & Cheering  News. I was glad to hear that you had again  returned to printing. I hope you will be supported  in it. As to the work in this country it is still on  the increase. the Churches generally are well umited [united]  & increasing in Numbers. there are some few exception  but wha[r]e this is the case it is for the want of faithful  Elders to labour. I suppose the Saints in this country  will now number near 11,000 thousands scattered over a  vast country & their is but about six 6 American Elders  that are in the whole field beside 2 or 3 of us at Liverpool  & Hence their is much more labour resting upon me  in answering a peck [pack] of letters or so Daily & keeping things  in order than their would be if we could have one ^100^ hundred  good wise Jusdicious men who had recceved their Endowment  & would act for the good of the Kingdom I feel anxious   to see such a day that I can strike hands with men  from Nauvoo who has recceved their Endowment that  will come to my help. what Elders there are in the field  here are doing Exceding well but are soon expecting to return  Home & I will then nearly be left alone as far as  labour in the vineyard a^i^s concerned. If We can hold  our own untill more help arives from Nauvoo I  shall think we do well. the Lord has been with me  on this mission & is still with me. I hope I shall stae [stay]  in the prayers of all the Lords Anointed. It has been 
 much consolation to me in the perusal of the prophet  to learn that Br Parley has backed up my teaching &  testimony which I gave to the Saints in the New England  Chuches in my visit with them on my way to England  I saw it was necessary for some such man as  Br Parley to preside over that region & my soul rejoiced  when I herd you was there. I am glad Elder  Brannan is restored. I think he will be much help to  you in [printing], I think he will listen to your  council. give my love to him & all the Saints who  inquire after me. I wish you would send the New York  Messenger to my Father (Aphek Woodruff Farmington  Hartford county Connecticut) & Betsey Cossett of   Sismsbury Hartford co Connecticut) & continue to   to forward them to me at (Standley Bu^i^ldings Bath [S]t [page torn]  Liverpool) & I will pay you for the three volums  We will forward the Star to you regular.  There is quite an Excitement at present in England  about the Texas question & Oregon whether they will  make war out of it at present or not I do not   know. But God said in the last days he would plead with  all flesh with fire & sword & the slain of the Lord should be  many. he has begun with ^[Fires]^ ^fire^ if the accouts from pittsburgh  Quebeck Smyrna & other parts of the world are [corct] &  I expect sword will follow in due time.

 I am trying to raise means for procuring a Bell & Clock  for the Temple. I do not yet know whether we shall purchase  in England or America. A Brass Bell 2000 lbs will cost  £140 & the duty on that will be £42 or $206 which is a heavy  duty & if we can get on in America as cheap it will save $200 duty  will be worth saving. I can get an Iron Bell for £20 but I  have no Idea that the Lord wants an Iron Bell at all    [upside-down text] Could you assertan what a Brass Bell of 2000 lbs weight could  be got for in the East or in any part of the States & communicate  the same to Br Young as I have sent him word about  it & he will wish to assertan it will be helping it on    W W [end of upside-down text]    [sideways text] President P.

 Historian's Office,   Great Salt Lake City, June 30th, 1856    Elder John Taylor,  Dear Brother,    We are very busy writing the history of the latter days of  Joseph, and we have a great many conflicting statements on the subject,  which renders it necessary for me to call in the aid of an eye and ear  witness to enable me to do justice to it. You are the only person on  earth who can render me this assistance; I shall therefore feel obliged if you  will take the earliest opportunity to sit down with your Hon. colleague the Chief  Historian, and write out an account of all the circumstances relating to this  subject which came under your immediate observation or experience from  the 20th June 1844 to the date of  your return from Carthage to Nauvoo.  Also please to give me the requisite information if you are able on the following  points:    Who were the Apostates staying at Hamilton's Hotel at the time in question?    At what period did Robinson stop the mail?    Joseph, Willard, and yourself tasted of the wine which was fetched by the guard  just previous to the martyrdom; did Hyrum taste of it?    Were you the mouth at prayer both evenings in jail? if not, who officiated  the first night, if any?    You sung "A poor wayfaring man of grief" at a quarter past 3 PM of  the 27th; was it Joseph or Hyrum who requested you to repeat it? I  have always understood that you had no sooner finished singing it the  second time than the firing commenced; if so there must have been a  considerable interval between the two exercises. What were the facts?    Who washed the bodies in Carthage?    Who nailed the boards together in which to take the bodies to Navuoo? 
 Elder Orson Pratt  G. S. L. City Feby. 2 1857    Dear Bro,    The Eastern mail for Jan. last started, and went  about 11 miles to the top of the first mountain and returned, one of the  party (not a mormon) having been froze to death in the snow, we have  not yet received any Eastern mail for the past months.    Judge Phelps reports the entire fall of snow in the city up to   the 24th. inst, has been over eight feet.  We have more snow in the  mountains than we have ever known since our arrival in the vallies.  It had lain for several weeks in this valley between 2 & 3 feet deep.  Many  have brought their cattle from the ranges Northward, also all the stock  of horses, cattle and sheep have been brought from the Island - as snow  is reported as being nearly 3 feet deep there - and fed them at home, &  large herds have been driven south into Utah Valley, some cattle have  died, but as yet few in comparison to what died last Winter.    The work of the Reformation is progressing throught this city &  Territory.  President Young has given much valuable information during  this winter to the Twelve and the people, the Spirit and power of God has  rested upon him, and his whole soul has been filled with charity, mercy,  long suffering, kindness, and a fatherly feeling towards his bethren and the   whole of this people, and his heart made glad in seeing the people in  a measure beginning to awake to a realizing sense of thier duties, and begin-  ning to feel the importance of magnifying their calling in the Priesthood and  of building up the kingdom of God.  The Tabernacle on Sunday, is now  crowded to overflowing in almost any stage of the weather, and hundreds  go away that cannot get in either to sit or stand.  For several 
 Historian's Office,  Great Salt Lake City, May 28th 1856    Dear Bror. O. Pratt,    As I commence my first letter in the Historian's Office,  I feel that you are the person that I should write to.    You may be aware that on Monday, the day before I parted with  you at the mouth of the Kanyon, that I had an ox die suddenly,  and in my endeavors to save the hide, while skinning it, I casually  scratched my left arm with a rib, and a few days afterwards the place  inflamed; a swelling rose on the spot, the poison virus got inoculated  into my system, which caused me 3 to 4 weeks' sickness, and which came  very near costing me my life. About the first labor on my recovering  so as to be able to get out of doors, was to be called up about midnight  on Thursday the 15th. inst to administer to your wife Sarah; I promised her  in the name of the Lord that all should be well with her and her child,  and she should be blest in her labor. In 15 minutes after she was  safely delivered of a very fine daughter, weighing 12 lbs. I have seen  her several times since, both she and her daughter are doing well.  I have now so far recovered from my sickness as to be able to attend  to business.    Eighteen days ago the mail arived from the East, being the first  news by way of the South Pass since last November; the Carrier only  brought in about one half of the bags sent from Independence [Using] that  line; the other half being cached somewhere between there and  here; perhaps left at Fort Laramie to amuse the U. S. soldiers with  our news and correspondence during the winter evenings.    The California mail has arrived pretty regularly this winter; by that   mail we receive the Western Standard, and letters from Bro Rich 
 Great Salt Lak City June 1st 1857    Brother Thompson    Dear Sir    The Eastern Mail has finally arrived  on the 29.

WOur crops Never looked better than this year our wheat  crops this year will be very Heavy if nothing Happens to them we  Had so much Snow last winter in the mountians thet we will have  a plenty of water for irrigation. I will hear say that I do  not feel very thankful to you for your kindness in tying to send  fruit to me I have never Received but one package from you this last  2 years ago. I graft the but not one lived. but as we have now  abot evry kind of Apples growing in the City that is Raised in th United Stats  I do not think that you had better be to any more trouble to send any more  Apple cuttings Here, for we can get here in the vally allmost any kind  I have Just received a quantity that came by the Last mail 17 diferent  kinds of Apples the following are all the New kinds except what I have (Coopers Market  St Lawrence   Sweet Bough  Coloret  Pomme Quiz)   we had a hasrd frost on the 9th day of May which killed my  Appricots & some peaches & Apples but my peach trees are stil  loaded with fruit & some of my Apples are 
 Two sets of messengers were sent from Carthage on the evening of the 27th  with the melancholy news to Nauvoo. What were their names, distinguishing  those who were turned back by Governor Ford?    Dan Jones makes the following statement: "We were awoke [during the night  of the 26th] by heavy treads as of soldiery close by, and heard a whispering  under the window 'who shall go in? how many shall go in? &c'.  They came up  stairs to the prison door, ^against^ which we had taken the precaution to place a chair;  hearing us speaking to each other they hesitated, when Joseph called out,  'come on ye assassins! we are ready for you, and would as willingly  die now as at daylight!' Hearing this they retired again."    Do you know anything of this, and if so, how far is the statement correct?    Jones says that he was sent down stairs by Joseph the first thing next morning  to ascertain the cause of the disturbances in the night, and was addressed by  the officer of the guard (Frank Worrell) as follows: "we have had too much  trouble to bring old Joe here to let him ever escape alive, and unless you want  to die with him you had better leave before sundown; and you are not a damned  bit better than him for taking his part, and you'll see that I can prophesy better  than old Joe, for neither he nor his brother, nor any one who will remain  with them will see the sun set to day."  He says Joseph then directed him  to go to Governor Ford and inform him of what had taken place, and what  had been said by the officer of the guard. How much of this is correct?    Jones says that the last words spoken on the evening of the 25th after  you had all retired to rest were by Joseph as follows: "Now see who will  have the most intelligent dream to night, brethren"; and that on awakening  next morning Joseph enquired who had the dream; when Jones himself related  one as follows: "Pourtrayed before my mind was Governor Ford and his troupe  on their way across the prairie to Nauvoo. The prisoners had intreated in vain

 Historian's Office,  G. S. L. City, May 6th 1856.    Bror Stephen Markham,    Historian George A Smith expected you would  have called at this office as you passed through the city; but  as you did not. I should feel obliged by your sitting down  with Bror Wm M Thompson, and draw^ing^ out the entire history  of Joseph's going over the river to Iowa, the cause of his return  from Iowa, thyour journey with him to Carthage, what transpired   while there both in and out of prison, and under what circumstances  you left Carthage. Also how the news of Joseph's death reached  Nauvoo, and all the other circumstances within your Knowledge  relating to the affair; sending me these particulars by the  very first consequence, as I wish to almalgamate it with what  we have already on hand. and I am just at that period  of the history.    Yrs truly,    Wilford Woodruff Historian    by Thomas Bullock -Clerk- 
 Sundays past the assembly has been addressed by Prest. Kimball at  length in great plainness upon various subjects; he has been clothed  with the Spirit and power of God, so that he has truly satisfied  his mind upon any subject, not regarding any false traditions, we  or our fathers may have imbibed, and the people are edified and  benefitted by what they hear, the ward school houses are all crowded  to excess during the evening meeting.  Brother W. D. Richards & myself being  the only one of the Twelve in the city, we organized the missionaries  with the assistance of Prest. Grant, under the directions of Prest. Young  to preach throughout this city, all the Wards during Winter have met  in the school houses several evenings in the week, to hear the word  of the Lord.  We have attended a meeting of some kind about every  evening for the last 3 months, we meet with the Seventies, High Priests,  Bishops, and ward meetings weekly, our preaching is mostly confined  to reformation, repentance, confession and forsaking of sin, baptism for  the remission of sins, living our religion, magnifying the Priesthood,  prizing the blessings which God has given us, paying our Tithing,  seeking first the kingdom of God and building it up, and mani-  festing our faith by our works and trusting in the Lord for our  blessings.  Elders O. Hyde & L. Snow were with us during the setting  of the Legislature and they have joined us in our missionary labors &  the Spirit & power of God has rested upon us in our labor.  Elder  Hyde has gone South on a mission and the people almost en mass  are rising up in the city, and in the country and are engaging in the reform-  ation, confessing their sins and  restoring what they have done wrong.  Meetings  are crowded, confidence is being restored and a more healthy atmosphere is  sensibly felt, and strong determinations are expressed by the brethren to  live their religion, practice virtue and righteousness, and put down sin &  iniquity in all its forms. 
 and the saints who are coming from the old countries, a sufficiency of  food for the next year.    Elder P. P. Pratt has again regained his health so far as to preach in   the Bowery last Sabbath; he has now gone on a mission to Utah County.    The Presidency and those of the Twelve who are here are enjoying  good health; they with the Council remember you in their prayers.    There are a few sick among us; among them Sister Mary Ann Young  and Mary Richards, who are a little easier to day.    Elder McCarthy, who was shipwrecked on one of the Society Islands  has baptized the interpreter to the King; he speaks 12 languages. Also  the interpreter to the Government Company, who speaks 5 languages. Bro.  McCarthy ordained them both Elders, and set them to preaching the  gospel in the midst of the people; so some good is growing out of his  shipwreck.    [We received a very respectful letter by the last mail from Sir W. J.  Hooker, Director of the Royal Gardens Kew, about 20 miles from London,  it is directed to the secretary of the Horticultural Society of Deseret.  He wishes to open a correspondence with us, and obtain seeds and specimens  of our mountain productions such as trees, shrubs, flowers, cactus, or any  native vegetation of our country, and proffers to forward to us anything  their noble gardens produce. He has sent us a printed circular, and  written letter. Should you be passing through that part of the country, woud  it not be well for you to call and have an interview with him? it may open  a door whereby good may came forth unto Israel; at least he promises  and freely offers to forward to our order any of the products of Her  Majesty's gardens at Kew, and I presume that contains as great and  good a variety of fruits, flowers, and herbage as can be found in the

 To the Bishops & Presidents of Branch of the Church of Jesus Christ of  Latter Day Saints Greeting    10 Dec 1856    Dear Brethren    We feel it our Duty to call upon  you to use your infleuence with all the Saints under your Care to  Stop selling their Grain Pork, Beef & provisions to the Gentile Members  of this City & Territoy for they are ^thirely^ throwing many thousands of Bushels  of grain into the hands of men to feed our Enemies & ^put it^ out of the  reach of our of this people. in case of famine & want, this should  not be for by persuing this course the people will, cut their own  thoats & Destroy themselves.

 to return with him, although he had promised that they should go. With a letter of  importance I saw myself driven from Carthage, galloping through the masses of mostly  soldiers, half Indians and semi barbarians. I hurried across the prairie, had  gone down on a boat from Nauvoo towards Quincy, but while landed at Warsaw  awoke in the midst of powder, smoke, death, and carnage." After he had  finished the recital of the dream he says that Joseph remarked, "that is ominous  of future events. I do not believe that the Governor will ever take me to Nauvoo  alive."    Do you remember this? and if not, what is your opinion respecting it?    The following is copied from Dr. Willard Richard's journal, and you will  perceive it is a meagre report of the interview with the Governor in Carthage jail;  as you were present you will doubtless be able to fill most of the blanks:    "Thursday, June 26th, 1844. 9:27^AM^ A.M. Gov & Col Geddes arrived at  the jail. Joseph stated the coming of the constable gave up called  upon some 20 bystanders that we submitted but fear of life go before  Esq.

 and others. I am very much pleased with the appearance of the  Standard; it is ably conducted, and I think it will prove a benefit  to the Saints, and help to keep at bay some of our vile columniators  who will not be so bare faced in their attacks when they see we have  a paper that will defend our cause.    We learn by the late mails that there is much trouble in Oregon and  Washington Territories; the Indians are having it pretty much all their  own way. I am happy to say by recent articles from our missionaries  in East Oregon, that all is peace with them. Prest. Young has talked  of sending up about 14 Wagons to bring back loads of dried salmon to  help out the scanty supplies of food in this country. Bro C. C. Rich is also  making calculations to furnish some grain for this Territory in case we get  too tightly pinched; but we feel thankful to our Heavenly Father for his  gracious mercies in sending us a beautiful shower every week since Prest.  J. M. Grant spoke upon "the dry moon", and exhorted the brethren to exercise  faith for rain, which you may remember, when it commenced raining  while he was preaching. The past week has been very warm, and wheat  is running fast; many brethren are in high glee, and are calculating  to commence cutting wheat about the 20th of June. The cut worm is  devouring a portion of the wheat and corn crops. The peas are beginning  to bloom beautifully; the potatoes and other crops are growing fine. At  the same time we have the music of the gulls as they fly over our heads seeking  for grasshoppers, crickets, and other insects, but they find very few to feed  upon. There is a greater abundance of grass in all the valleys and  mountains than we have had for two years. We can say the brethren continue  busy planting corn and late crops, and all the old broke land is being cropped,  which shows an untiring zeal in those who remain to secure for themselves

 Historian's Office,   Great Salt Lake City, May 30th, 1856    Editor of the Luminary,  Sir,    In pursuance  of the plan adopted by the Church Historian,  Elder Geoe. A. Smith, I, as assistant Historian, wish to continue the  monthly correspondence from this office.    I have been very sick for the last 5 weeks, but am  now much better. Elder Parley P. Pratt has also just recovered  from a severe spell of sickness, which rendered him quite insensible  for some time.    The Indians are kicking up quite a fuss in Oregon  and Washington Territories and the U. S. troops under Coll. Steptoe  are in active operation against them. Report says the latter have had  the worse of it in one engagement at least; but they will no  doubt finally succeed in checking the war.    We have received several numbers of the Western Stand-  ard from San Francisco and I am very much pleased with its  style, spirit and appearance; it bids fair to be a useful aux-  iliary to our Pacific interest.    The Presidency are enjoying good health, as also their  families, with the exception of Sister Mary Ann Young, and she  is recovering.    Elder McCarthy who embraced the Gospel in Australia, and  was shipwrecked on his way here, and obliged to stop on the  Society islands, has baptized the Interpreter to the king of those  Islands, as also the Interpreter to the government there. He has  also ordained them both Elders, and set them to preach the Gospel 
 Historian's Office,  Great Salt Lake City, June 30th, 1856.    Editor of the Mormon,  Sir,    The mail from the east due here towards the last  of May arrived here on the 4th inst, and contained 44 letters  for this Territory; whereas our friend Leonard I. Smith was  at Independence (on his way home from the Cape of Good Hope)  when the mail started, and was told by the clerk there that he  had put up from five to ten thousand letters for Salt Lake  within a day or two!! The June mail arrived here on the 28th  inst, but has brought no tidings of the missing letter sacks. I suppose  the Contractor is shewing his gratitude in this way for the appropriation  by Congress of $36,000 extra pay for keeping us without a mail  the whole of last winter from the 1st Dec to the 10th of May!!    We are still a little plagued with grasshoppers, the wheat crops in  Box Elder County being eaten off; we are also troubled with  drouth and scarcity of water; yet we shall make out to harvest  a crop, though not an average one by any means.    The canal from Big Cottonwood is so far finished as to bring  the water to irrigate the 10 and five acre lots in the Big Field.    You will ^have^ received a programme of our intended celebration of  the 4th July from the Post Office.    Prest. Young and Kimball have been spending a few days on the  Island in Salt Lake; they as well as Prest. Grant are in good health    The Deseret Agricultural and Manufacturing Society are  holding weekly meetings, and making great efforts to carry out  their objects; there is to be an Exhibition this fall. 
 Law read was stated by Reed to belong to civil not criminal cases.    State insisted to have a commission crime acknowledged.  Court asked if the parties admitted there was sufficient cause to bind  over [blank] and the council admitted there was sufficient cause to bind  over [blank] with cognizance in common form.    Court acknowledged the admission and ordered cognizances at 5 p.m."    You will not doubt be able to tax your memory sufficiently to fill up  these blanks.    Do you know anything of a petition which was drawn up on the 27th  at Nauvoo by the wives ^and other female relatives^ of the prisoners during the time that the Governor  was making his speech near the Mansion, and presented to him afterwards  in the Mansion? and particularly, are you satisfied from what you  may have gathered from the statements of your wife or others, that Emma  refused to sign said petition?    I want you to describe the scenes in the jail with great care and  minuteness; for as I said before you are the only man on earth who  can do it.    It would be desirable to unite Dr. Bernhisel with your council on  this subject, as he was back and forth between Nauvoo and Carthage  during the period in question, and will be able to throw light on some  things without doubt. I am writing him and Bror. Geo. A Smith by  this mail, and will refer you to them for general news.    As we are now right upon this part of the History, and find that  it must remain open during your pleasure, I believe you will lose  no time in attending to the matter.    I saw Mrs. Taylor a day or two since; she and your family are well.    Yrs truly,    W. Woodruff 
 G. S. L. City Decem 7. 1856    Ed. of the Standard    Dr. Brother    The Cala. Mail having arrived last evening, I hasten to  write you a few lines.    Prest. J. M. Grant died here on Monday evg at the  1st Dec at 10:20 twenty minutes past 10, after an illness of about 32  weeks being taken ^seized^ first with chills & Fever then Billious Fever &  died of Lung Fever. it was ^a sudden^ unexpected ^shock^ in Israel. and Prest Grant  was in the bloom prime of life, ^40 years of age^, and in Israel was a his Priesthood  was truly a mighty man in Israel.    In the Reformation which was going on in Israel  his bow was bent & his quiver full of arrows, which were so well  directed he had becaome a terror to evil doers, & a joy & consolation to  the righteous. Prest. Young addressed the concourse of Saints who  met on the 4th to pay the last mark of trib tribute of repect to his  earthy remains while when they were to be laid in the silent tomb, &  poured lifted up the vail from the peoples ^our^ eyes so that we indeed  felt Jedediah was not gone, but he was still with us ^& near us^ in the  great work of the last days.

 On Sunday the 1st. inst. all the Presidency were present, the  first time that Prest. Young has been able to attend at the Tabernacle  since the burial of Prest. J. M. Grant on the 4th. D e cern.  Wl.  He ad-  dressed the people for about one hour and a half, clothed with the spirit  and power of God, his discourse was very edifying and instructive and the  vast assembly deeply felt the weight of his words.  He was followed by  Prests. Kimball and Wells, all of their discourses will be seen in the Deseret  News.    Prest. Joseph Young has had a severe time of sickness this  winter, he was very low, but is now much recovered and able to be among  his brethren, and attend to the duties of his calling as President of the  Seventies.    Elder Dan Jones has been employed while the weather  would permit in fitting up a craft with which to explore Salt Lake,  and the mouth of the Bear river and the Jordan, and to find what  navigation is practicable on the Lake and its tributaries, he is now  trying to boat fire wood from Stansbury Island to Black rock, from   which point it can easily be drawn into the city.  The Blacksmiths at  the public works finished him an anchor weighing 330 lbs for his boat.    The Bishops of the various Wards are making their calcul-  ations to finish off the Canal this Spring so that the waters of the  Big cottonwood can be used on our farming land and in the city.

I am much pleased at the  style and general character of the paper and consider it a liv-  ing testimony of the increasing strength and potency of Gods  kingdom in the earth.

 The first can speak 12 languages and the other 5.    It is rumoured that General Harney is about to pass  through this Territory with his command on his way to Oregon. I  hope he will not think of trying to drain away our provisions,  as we want once more to live in the midst of plenty.    We expect an early harvest, having had refreshing rains about  once a week since the 1st April; the wheat never looked better  and some believe the harvest will commence about the 20th June.  Peas and other vegetables are also looking fine.    The Indian Agent Dr. Garland Hurt is making a  very extensive farm on the Spanish Fork for the Indians, and  employing a good many of our brethren.

We are informed there are 1000's of Emigrants, with  large herds of cattle, en route for the Gold Mines. I hope their  fever won't decrease when they meet the thousands upon  thousands who are reported to be coming from there, on their  return to their homes, leaving many disappointed ones at the  diggings. If they think to winter here their only chance  will be to live on their cattle and chew the cud of discontent    The Salt Lake is so low that wagons have been driven  to the Island the past week. The snow has also disappeared  from the Mountains, so that we do not anticipate any "high  water" this season    We have derived another benefit from "the hard times";  the people are generally, or I may say all well, for they cannot  eat more than the stomach can healthily dispose of.

 We have been over to the Public Works, and find they are casting  moulds to run pig lead into from the furnace.    I am spending most of my time in the office compiling the history  of the last days of Joseph and Hyrum.    The weather has been very dry and warm for the last few  weeks.    The people are generally enjoying good health.    Two new boats have been taken to the ferry at Bear River, and  there is a ferry newly started on the Weber.

 The first can speak 12 languages and the other 5.    It is rumoured that General Harney is about to pass  through this Territory with his command on his way to Oregon.  I  hope he will not think of trying to drain away our provisions,  as we want once more to live in the midst of plenty.    We expect an early harvest, having had refreshing rains about  once a week since the 1st April; the wheat never looked better  and scome believe that harvest will commence about the 20th June.  Peas and other vegetables are also looking fine.    The Indian Agent Dr. Garland Hurt is making a  very extensive farm on the Spanish Fork for the Indians, and  employing a good many of our brethren.    We are beginning to have very hot weather —on the  28th it was 84º at one p.m. and yesterday 79º. The brethren  are beginning to irrigate their gardens &c    Yours truly,    W. Woodruff    P.S.

 to irrigate the Big Field, and the South East portions of the  City, so that many persons anticipate they will raise sufficient  to sustain themselves, and have a little to spare to those who  are now wheeling barrows over the plains, for they assuredly  will be fed after filling their toilsome journey.    We are informed there are 1000's of Emigrants, with  large herds of cattle, en route for the Gold Mines. I hope their  fever won't decrease when they meet the thousands upon  thousands who are reported to be coming from there, on their  return to their homes, leaving many disappointed ones at the  diggings. If they think to winter here their only chance  will be to live on their cattle and chew the cud of discontent    The Salt Lake is so low that wagons have been driven  to the Island the past week.  The Snow has also disappeared  from the Mountains, so that we do not anticipate any "high  water" this season    We have derived another benefit from "the hard times";  the people are generally, or I may say all well, for they cannot  eat more than the stomach can healthily dispose of.

 G. S. L. City Feby. 2 1857.  Editor of the Western Standard    Dear brother,  After so much of a hard and snowy winter, un-  equalled since we settled in these mountains, the past few days of sunny  weather almost make us believe Spring has commenced; over 8 feet of snow  has fallen this winter in our city. The snow has been 2 & 3 feet deep  in our streets during the month of January; Northward it has been  deeper: In Utah valley South there has not been so much. The cattle  and sheep have been brought from the island where snow is about 3  feet deep, and many have been driven into the city from the ranges North  Few have died in comparison to last year.    The abundance of snow in the mountains will be of much  benefit the coming year for irrigation, and with such a gradual warm  thaw as is going on at present, the land must receive a thorough  soaking, which is cheering prospects to a community whose primary &  chief dependence is Agricultural.    The Eastern mail for January made an attempt at crossing  the mountains for the East, but only got up the first mountain where  on finding the snow so very deep it was considered impracticable to  proceed further. They returned finding one carrier froze to death in the  snow.    Elder Dan Jones has been employed while the weather would  permit in fitting up a craft with which to explore Salt Lake, and the  mouths of Bear river and the Jordan, and to find what navigation is  practicable on the Lake and its tributaries, he is at present making  arrangements to boat fire wood from Stansbury Island to Black rock,  from which point it can easily be drawn into the city.  The Blacksmiths 
 has been more rain than any previous season. It is now very  warm Thermometer to day is at 85° Fah. in the shade—very  warm for May.    Several families have been eating Green peas since the  25th. we anticipate an early Spring. If the weather continues favor-  able many will harvest Barley and Wheat in June.    The shores of Utah Lake are crowded like a fair with wag-  ons—there are so many catching and drying fish.    Brother Maughn of E. T. City has found lead on the  ridge between our city and Tooele valley. Many samples have been  brought to the President supposed to contain 60 per cent of pure  lead—John [Stake] sent a sample of 3 1/2 lbs from the Los Vegas contain-  ing 90 per cent pure lead. N. V. Jones has started to examine  it, and to commence smelting it.    We have got one mail from the East during the last  5 months, it arrived on the 10th of May last - some think there  will be another mail this Summer, but we can't say.    Our Fruit culturists are calculating on a midling harvest  of Peaches, and considerable other fruit this season.    The health of the Presidency and Twelve with their  families is very good, except Sister Mary Ann Young who has  been very sick, tho' she is getting better now.    Yours truly,  W. Woodruff

Please remember me kindly to brothers Benson and Richards.  also to the Elders generally.    On the reading of our communication to Sir W. J.

 at the public works finished an anchor weighing 330 lbs for his boat.    The Bishops of the various Wards are making their calculations  to finish off the Canal this Spring, so that the waters of the Big  Cottonwood can be used on our farming land and in the city.    The reformation is progressing throughout this city and Territory  with great interest; President Young has given much valuable information  during the winter to both the Elders and people. The Spirit and power  of God has rested upon him, and his whole Soul has been filled with  mercy, charity & brotherly kindness towards this people, and his heart has been  made glad, and his Spirit cheered to see the people rise up en masse and  manifest a strong determination to live their religion, repent and forsake  all their sins, and put away evil of every kind out of the midst of  Israel. The people appear to feel the importance of awakening to a  realizing sense of their duties, and magnifying their calling in the  Holy Gospel and Priesthood. The Tabernacle on the Sabbath has been  crowded to overflowing during the winter, and hundreds have to re-  turn home who cannot get a chance to either sit or stand in the  house. The assembly has been addressed during the winter mostly  by the Presidency & Twelve, and the Spirit and power of Revelation  inspiration, teaching and counsel has rested upon them, and the hearts  of thousands who were honest before God have been made glad through  their words, while the wicked and ungodly have been made to fear and  quake and fearfulness has surprized the hypocrite, because of the plainness  of the word of God which has been made manifest in Zion. President  Brigham Young has not been able to attend in the Tabernacle since  he attended the funeral of J. M. Grant on the 4th December until  last Sunday the 1st inst. when his appearance in the stand created a deep  sensation throughout the vast assembly, who were congregated in the 
 [This page is the reverse of previous page] 
 Tabernacle. He addressed the people for about one hour and a half  with the power of God and his discourse was very instructive, and  edifying, and the people deeply felt the force of his teachings upon  practical religion, honoring God, bringing ourselves in subjection to  the law of God, & rightly prizing the blessings which he bestows upon  us. The loss man will meet with by committing sin, breaking his  covenants and disobeying his Heavenly Father. He was followed by Presidents H.   C. Kimball and D. H. Wells who spoke much to the edification of the  people all of which will appear in the Deseret News. For several sabbaths  previous, the assembly has been addressed by President Kimball, who has spoke  upon several subjects in great plainness, without any regard to any false tra-  ditions which the people may have imbibed, and the people have been much  instructed and benefitted in the plain teachings which they have received this  winter. The Twelve have gone forth at the head of the Missionaries  throughout every ward in this city during the winter, attending Ward meetings  and meetings with the various quorums of the church in the Reformation,  and I have spent one of the most interesting scenes of my life. I have  attended a meeting of some kind almost every evening for three months, and  the Lord has labored with us and we think much good has been done. The  fruits of it are manifest among the people, and we are enjoying a healthy  atmosphere, and the people seem determined to practice virtue and holiness and  to put down vice and iniquity in all its forms.    I wish to give our friend Wm. C. Dodge credit for forwarding  me a bottle of Quince cuttings, and a few black prince Strawbury roots, not  having received any line or note with them, I had no explanation what   kind of Quinces the were, we have but few Quinces growing as yet in  our city, we will graft them into what we have. I have a few which  bloomed last season but have not yet developed any fruit. I discover from 
 [This page is the reverse of previous page] 
 Wm. R. Prince's catalogue of Strawberries, that the black prince  such as was sent me was classed among the rejected lot, and that  kind especially pointed out as unproductive, yet I shall take care  of them and see what they will produce. I would like very much to  obtain some of Hovey's seedlings as they are counted first class fruit, or any  other good kinds. We would also like to obtain some Indigo & madder seed,  from some of our california friends, if it can be obtained, as we would  like to make a trial of it in this Territory. We want to get enough  Indigo seed for over two acres as a trial. We have some of the chinese  sugar cane seed which will be tryed by several persons the ensuing season  and I am requested to say that if any of our friends in San Bernardino  or California who are coming through this Spring will bring cotton seed  sufficient to plant 5 or 6 acres they shall be amply rewarded for the  same.    yours truly,  W. Woodruff    Feby. 4 2 p.m. Cala. mail just arrived
