Wells sealed 17 coupleMarch 30, 1862 ~ Sunday30 Sunday I met with my Quorum in the morning and attended meeting in the Tabernacle all day. President Wells & Kimball spoke inthe morning & President Young Preached in the afternoon and He[FIGURE] delivered unto the people one of the most interesting Beneficial doctrinal sermons that was ever delivered unto the House of Israel. He revealed the principles of the Judgment. He said thatGod would Judge the world but How would He Judge the world He would not sit in Judgment upon Each individual case. But the Lord wouldpreside over all his Prophets and Apostles of Evry generation andHe sent them forth with a dispensation of the gospel to the children ofmen in various ages of the world, those who recieved their testimony and abided by their council would have no sins to pay for after death, but the wicked would be Judged after death, it is said that Christ will Judge the world But He chose 12 Apostles also 70 & many others as Helps. it is said that the 12 Apostles would sit upon Twelve 
 30th 1862Thrones & Judge the Twelve tribes of Israel but they will notJudge all individual cases. Joseph Smith will preside over this dispen-sation and Judge but He has chosen 12 Apostles 70ties & we have HighPriest, High Council, and Bishops to Jud[g]e the people Joseph will not JudgeEach individual neither shall I neither do I want to spend my time in listening to the sins & nonsens of the People. But all the saints should submit to the authority which is over them if a man sins & He istryed by his bishop and Judgment passed upon him & the man submits to that Judgment that is the End of the Law. and this is the fulfilling of the scripture whare it says that "some mens sins go to Judgment beforewhile other follow after" if the saints sin and they are tried, Judged condemned, & the saints submit to that Judgment they will never be Judged afterwards. this power is given into the Hands of the Apostles or those who hold the keys of the pristhood that "whosoever sins ye remit are [remitted] & whosoever sins ye retain are retained and whatsoever ye bind on Earth is bound in Heaven." I do not Expet that there will be much time spent after death in Judging the saints but the wicked will have to be Judged. If I was to say that the sinsof this Church should be remitted & forgiven it would be donebut I dont want to say that for we have got to mayny poorcurses among us who will commit sin and I want them topay for there sins many other interiesting remarks were made by President Young.

 Jan 27th 1860Minutes of A meeting of the Presidency Twelve Presidents of Seventiesand others assembled in President Youngs Council Room at 6 oclokThare were Present, President Young President Kimball (D H Wells sick)All of the Twelve except A. Lyman & G. A. Smith who was sickThe Presidency of the Seventies Bishop Hunter & many othersA Hymn was sung O Happy Souls who pray Prayer By O HydePresident Young stated the object of the meeting was to conversupon Doctrinal Points to see if we see alike & think alike I Praythat we may have the spirit of God to rest upon us that our minds may be upon the subject & that we may speak by the Holy spiritHe then called upon A Carrington to read a sermon he readit before the company a peace prepared for the press written byOrson Pratt upon the Godhead He claimed that it was the atributes of God that He worshiped and not the person & that He worshiped those Atributes whether He found them in God, Jesus Christ Adam, Moses, The Apostles Joseph, Brigham or in any body Els after the document was read PresidentYoung then called upon the Twelve to express their feelings uponthe subject He called upon O Hyde to speak & he called uponTJ Taylor to speak He spoke a short time No one knew atthe time (except the President & Carrington) who was the auth[or]of the document read. Brother Taylor said he did not see it in that light He worshiped a personage and not the Atributeshe thought God was Located and could not worship the Atributesin any body. President Young then called a vote of the assemblyand said if you understand this to be a correct doctrin as herewritten I wish you manifested it by saying yes No one spokePresident Young then said do I worship Atributes or thedispenser of those Atributes I worship the Disspencer of thoseof those atributes, and Not the Atributes. This is O Pratts sermonprepared for the Press I do not want to have it published if it isnot right. Brother Orson worships the Atributes of God but notGod I worship not the Atributes but that God who holds and dispenses if Eternity was full of atributes and No one to dispensthem they would not be worth a feather. Suppose an Angels comesto us to Night with a message From God and he tels the angelsnot to make himself known He comes to us with a message 
 27th 1860and gives a New Law and a penalty for not obeying you may ask whoare you he may not tell you who he is or he may say God sentme, you may say whare is that God who sent you I dont know or careany thing about you or what you say. He might say to you I am a godto you. Moses said to Israel I am a God to you. Joseph said to usI am a God to you, this was true and upon the same principles I am a God to this people & so is any man who is appointed to lead Israel orthe Kingdom of God if the people reject him they reject the one whosent him but we will let that drop, and turn to the other subjet now suppose we were all to receive a fullness of the Atributes of God andAccording to Orson Pratts Theory The Lord had a fulness and we couldHe could not advance but we could advance till we were Equal to himthen if we worshiped the Atributes instead of God we would soon worshipourselves as soon as we had a fulness of those atributes then youcannot worship any thing beyound yourself you would then worshipthe atributes & not the dispenser of those atributes "this is fals doctrin"God did not say worship Moses because he was a God to the people, youmay say to your wife or son do so & so, they will say I will not but I will go to a greater man I will go to Brigham Young, you might sayI am your counciller Dictator or your God Either would be correctand they should obey your Just & righteous command yet they should^not^ worship you for this would be sin. Orson Pratt has differed fromme in many things, But this is a great principle & I do not wish to sayyou shall do so and so I do not know of a man who has a mathamat-ical turn of mind but what goes to Far. The trouble between Orson Pratt & me is I do not know Enough & he knows to much. I do notknow evry thing their is a mystery concerning the God I worship which mystery will be removed when I come to a full knowledgeof God. One of the greatest things Joseph Smith ever did was toFamiliarize Heaven & Earth and cause them to shake hand togetherand become Familiar together this was a great principle it is sim-ple yet true. When I me[e]t the gGod I worship I expect to personagewith whom I have been acquainted, upon the same principle thatI would to meet with my Earthly Father after going upon a Journey & returning home.W. Woodruff spoke & said thatit is our privelege so to live as to have the spirit of God to bearrecord of the Truth of any revelation that comes from God through 
 27th 1860the mouth of his Prophet who leads his people and it has everbeen a key with me that when The Prophet who leads presentsa doctrin or principle or says thus saith the Lord I make it a pointto received it even if it comes in contack with my traditionor views being well satisfied that the Lord would reveal the truthunto his Prophet whom he has called to lead his Church before hewould unto me, and the word of the Lord through the prophet isthe End of the Law unto me. O Hyde & Joseph Young both backedme up. Joseph Young said "I do not believe in the doctrin of worshiping the attributes and not the Auther I once loved a womanshe says to me you shall have my respect & kind regards &she told me to go in peace I told her it was not her good will that I wanted alone I wanted her. So with my God if he was to say to me Joseph here take my attributes & go Iwould say No Father it is not your attributes alone that Iwant but I want you. When I read O Pratts views in the seer I could not swallow it. Joseph the Prophet said whenyou see your Father you will see him Just as he was in this lifeownly he will be full of Strength Glory Immortality & Eternal life President Brigham Young said now here is the TwelveI wish to extend there Influence as Far as I can but I cannotdo it while I ^they^ teach Fals doctrin One of the causes of the declartionin England (as I understand the people are clear down) is whatOrson Pratt Preached in the seer. There is not a man in the Church that can preach better than Orson Pratt upon anysubject which he understands it is music to hear him but thetrouble is he will preach upon things he does not know anything about and tehen he will preach fals doctrin & so willElder Hyde, He preaches upon the resurrection & teachesthings which are not true. I will tell you the Godwhich you and I worship, it is a Being that was on an Earthlike this He has been cloathed in Mortality the same as we have been and he has had Devils to fight the same as we have hadbut I do not expect they were the same Devils that we have. That Godsays I am your God and there is none Els let us worship him and noneEls. He is the God that we have. No matter what Gods Enoch saw whenthe heavens were opened unto him if the God he saw had been exalted

James Ferguson Clairman of the Committee on Memorials Presented a Memorial to the assembly which was read and adopted but returned to the Committee to Finish & prepare it By ingrossing. President Young addressed the assembly He said I suppose the people will expect a politicalspeech from me but I shall not say much but this much I will say, we should guide the people by acts & not by words. I have been the Govornor of this Territory some Eight years and every thing has been done that was necessary and all has been done right all our documents have been got vary corr-ectly I have had good Clerks around me. We now are about to step into a State Government. we shall not take any illegal steps, we are doing Nothing Except what theConstitution of the United States garuntee unto us, butwe have not felt before to take this step untill now, we now feel to do it it is our duty and we think we can maintain a Government. We do not wish to refer tothe past but prepare for the future if the United States will admit us well if not better it will be all right. we will not break down the door in order to get in. This is theownly people on the Continent who are tru to the Constitution of the United States Read the Constitution and then say whois guilty of treason we are the ownly people in the US who is 
 22nd 18612not guilty of treason. What kill people for there religion and not be guilty of treason and the whole Nation is guilty of this Now take your rights and maintain them it is time to do it. you have chosen me as your Govornor. I have been the governor all the time of this people and shall be And I will say to you and to all men that I will not hold this office or officiate in it ownly as I shall be dictated by the Holy Priesthood of the Son of God.If you hear any man say that we are not doing right in Holding a convention & forming a state Government tell them it is not so, we are doing mothing but what is strictly Constitutio-nal. We shall be the ownly people that will maintain the Const-itution while others will break it. We will ask Congress to admit us into the family of states what if they do not? We have got a Government and what are they going to do about it If the Constitution has been carried out it would have hungPresident Buchannan and all who were associated with himin making war upon us. Some want to stay longer to talkbut I am willing the United States should know that we arecapable of doing up important business in a short time mustchfaster than any other people. I like this Constitution. Butwhat Business has such a sentence in the Constitution that all men may worship God as they please? what do the people knowabout God it would be much more applicable if it said that all men might make a God of Gold, silver, Brass Iron wood or stone or of any thing Els and worship that. But now let us go to and worship God & maintain his kingdomupon the Earth in the name of Jesus Christ AmenPresident Heber C. Kimball followed with a short address We received a communication Fomrom Govornor Fuller& Ex Govornor Doty which was read to the assembly. Gov Doty & Judge Kenney both sustained us in our positionAtThe Convention adjourned till tomrorrow 1 oclok At the close of the Convention I made a supper for the Presidency and Twelve all attended Except President Young who thinking the apointment was next day did not attend 
 January 23, 1862 ~ ThursdayJan 23, 1862The convention Met to day at 1 oclock roll called all present Prayer by the Chaplain Joseph Young. A communication was received from Ex Govornor Doty giving leave to publish his communication in the Deserett News. The Constitution of the State of Deserett was Presented Engrossed it was taken up & read then allof the delegates to the Convention came forward and signed the Constitution By Counties I signed Wilford Woodruff to five Copies, and I consider it the most important document that I ever attached my signature to.Judge John F. Kinney addressed the Convention while themembers were signing the Constitution. his speech is Published in the Deserett NewsResolved that that the President & Secretary of theis convention be authorized to sign the Moemorial to Congress.President D. H. Wells then addressed the assembly. He said I do not feel as much like talking as I do like acting. Why will Congress shut the door to us because we wereMormons and they would not do it if this was not the true Church of Christ. But the days will come when the people of the United States will seek unto this people for Unionfor this people will have a permanent Government JosephSmith told what would come to pass. He spoke of this war said it would begin at South Carolina but He dare not publish it at First for fear the people would call ittreason. yet it is coming to pass before our Eyes. What is done here is done by the unanimous voice of all the people. Nota voice is lifted against it this is an Evidence that it isright. President Young asked Judge Kinney if He was willing to have his speech published Judge Kenney said yes He was willing. President Young said I here want to say a word upon a principle my text is Election & Reprebation did Joseph Smith make the war on South Carolina? No He did not but He foretold it, and that was all he had to do in the matter Many men can see no difference between foreknowledge & 
 18612Foreordination. Joseph Smith foreknew the war but He didnot foreordain it S. Rigdon and many others could neversee any difference between the two But the Gods & the prophetsForeknow things which they do not ForeordainE. T. Benson Moved that this Convention Do now dissolveThe minutes were read & ExceptedThe assembly was dismissed by W. W. PhelpsJanuary 24, 1862 ~ Friday24 Friday I spent most of the day in the officeJanuary 25, 1862 ~ Saturday25 I spent the day in the office writingJanuary 26, 1862 ~ Sunday26th Sunday I met with my Quorum in the morning Wilfordopened by Prayer & I was mouth I attended meeting at the Tabernacle. Wm H Folsom Preachedin the morning & Phineas Young & President Brigham Young in the afternoon. I attended Meeting in the eveningat the 14th ward School House Brother Moody and ComingsPreached followed by Bishop Hoagland.January 27, 1862 ~ Monday27th [FIGURES]One of the most Damniable, Diabolical, Satanical, HelishSacraleges has been committed upon the bodies of theDead Saints in the burial Ground East of this city andbrought to light this day that was ever known or recorded in the History of man. Clawson who was shot dead a few days since while resisting theofficers of Justice He was buried by the Citiesy authoritiessome of Clawsons friends obtained permission from the sextion to take up the bodiesy and remove it to the Big Cotton Burying ground they took up the coffincontaining the body of Moroni Clawson and whenthey opened the coffin they found the corps Nakedwhich was cloathed when it was buried this ledto a careful inquiry & Examination. Jesse C. Little the Sexton had imployed a Man b[y] the name ofJohn Baptiste to dig the graves & bury the dead from 1859 up to the present time the police immediately 
 1862went to his house and made a serch and they foundmany Bundles of graves cloathes about his house in various parts they also found a large Box filled fullof the clothing of the dead from little infants to the aged ofboth sexes. Mr Baptiste was at the grave yard at thetime the poliece went up to him and he was picking upcobble stones & took him up to the grave of Clawson and accused him of Robing the dead body He denyedit but after being choaked a while He confessed it andthen confessed that th he had been robing the dead forTwo and a half years they then took him down to prisionand all of the clothing of the dead found in his possessionwas taken to the Court House and there Exhibited sothat any persons who had buried friends since He hadbeen diging graves might se if they could recognize thegrave clothes Mrs Woodruff & myself went down tose if we could recognize the grave cloths of Father Woodruffbut we could recognize Nothing as the Aprons were alldestroyed and the robes taken to peaces. There lay the gravecloths of fifty persons or more some twenty pair of little childrens stockings and the clothing of all ages male& female which that man had striped from the deadBodies of Saints & sinners. He done his work mostly nights He had a house nearest to the grave yard so that noperson had detected him in his diabolical work. The anoun-cement of it to the public created great consternation throughthe city. On Being questioned Baptiste acknowledged that He had been carriying on this Hellish work for three years anda half his ownly motive was to seell the clothing He said thedevil was in him which I think was trueJanuary 28, 1862 ~ Tuesday28th The Policce took up Baptiste to the grave yard to dayto point out the graves which He had opened. But there weremany persons in the Grave yard who felt Exasperated in there feelings and He did not point out more than a doz graves whichHe had opened for fear he would be killed. No Estimate can be made of the Number of the dead He has robed 
 1862I would probably range from One to three Hundred some10 graves were opened to day several of them were found robedHe gave a list of some 15 Names which he had robed of latesome of those graves have been opened & the bodies found Naked. John Baptiste was Born in Venace in 1814. What willbe done with the man I do not knowIt was afterwords reported that John Baptist was branded inthe forehead as A Robber of the dead, & croped & placed upon Millers Island, & he undertook to cross onthe Lake on a frailRaft & was drowned as supposed as he never was heardof after. He robed the dead in Australia to such an Extentthat he built a methodist meeting house with the avails of hisrobery so he testified.January 27, 1862 ~ Monday27 I met at 1 oclok at the 17 ward school House to attendthe meeting of the Jordon Irrigation Company for the purposeof the organization of the company.

But as to the punishment of the man to shoot or hangthe man would not satisfy my feelings at all, it came to mymind when I first herd of it, if I should unDertake to punishhim at all I would want to crop him & then print with India ink upon his forehead (croped for robing the dead)2nd discourse was making dancing Halls of our schools & meetingHouses. I am opposed to it Dancing and Theaters is no part of my religion this is by permission but I do not want themamalgamated. 3rd Attendtion paid to Females some Femalescomplain that there is not attention Enough paid to them in this community But I will say that there is no community onEarth where as much respect & attention is paid to Females asin this Church. Every old woman thinks she must go to Everyparty, and Many a first wife thinks she should be a Queen and the rest of the wives surfs. But this I do not Believe in4th We cannot get the Telegraphic News printed under a day or two after it comes I Believe Elias Smith is writing his own History 
 9th Feb 1862In the afternoon President Heber C. Kimball spoke Br Joseph Fielding spoke first Bore his Testimony & was followed by Brother Kimball. I met alone at the prayer circle at 5 oclkand prayed at the alter I went to the 13 ward Assemblyroom & Preached to the people 30 minutes was followed byBishop Hunter.

We got a long Telegraphetic dispatch printed which gives an account of the warFebruary 12, 1862 ~ Wednesday12 I spent the day in the office on the Buy laws of the Joordan Irrigation Company & Journalizing[FIGURE] A Lecture of W. Woodruff in the Seventies Hall Upon History and Journallizing on the evening of Feb 12. I met at the 70 Hall at 7 oclok to deliver a lecture accordingto appointment the Hall was crouded to overflowing and Hundreds Had to leave who could not get into the House the following is a synopsis of my lectureBrethren and Sisters I feel Happy in meeting with you in this capacity. I think it more profitable for the saints to meet together to hear lectures delivered upon the arts & scien-ces and various principles than to spend so much time in danceing and light amusement. The subject which I wish to speak upon this Evening is Journalizieing & History this subject Embraces a wide Field far greater than I shall attempt to Explore this Evening. History is given undertwo general Heads viz Sacred and profane and as spiritual and temporal things are inseparably connected, so is sacred & profane History many times is vary closely connectedtogether. We have but vary little History in the Early ages of the world Either Sacred or Profane, and but vary few His-torians or Journalists in any age of the world when 
 1862compared with other callings & avocations of life. I shallnot say much upon profane History during this Evening I willHowever refer to one or two prominent Historians. Rollinscompiled an Elaberate History of the ancient Medes, Persians Asyrians, Babylonians, & Caldeans. He gives a History of their government customs Literature & Laws but more Esspecially of their wars. I would recommend this History for our yound [young] men to read who wish to become acquainted with an-cient History. I would also recommend the reading of Josepheus the great Jewish Historian it appears to me that no man can read with indiference His account of the siege of Jerrusalemby the Roman Army the destruction of their city & Temple theircaptivity & dispersion among the Gentiles Nations. Here in the siege of Jerrusalem over one million of Jews perished inby the sword famine, pestilence, & fire. I would also refer to the History of Greece & Rome & Modern Europe & America or the History of any Nation and ask how have we obtained the History of thoseNations, Kingdom & Countrys. you may say that Historians have handed those things down unto us, But How have Historians obtained materials from which to compile therire History?I answer From the scribes, reporters, & Journalists who wrote day by day Events as they passed before there Eyes and this class of men forms the foundation of all History and from there Material, Historians who live hundreds of years afterEvents transpire will compile History. But without materialHistorians cannot make History or any thing Else.I will call your attention to what is called sacred or Bibli-cal History. Moses wrote the first five Books viz J##Genesis## ##Exodus|Exiodus## ##Leviticus##, ##Numbers##, & ##Deuteronomy|Dieuteronomy##. But He gives but vary little History of the Early ages of man. We have a revelation in the ##Doctrine and Covenants 107:53-54|doctrins & covenants## page 79 which says that "three years before the death of Adam He called Seth, Enos, Cainan, Mahalaleel,Jared Enoch & Methuselah all who were High Priests withthe residue of his posterity who were righteous into the valleyof Adam Ondi Ahman and there bestowed upon them his last Blessing and the Lord appeared unto them and they rose 
 1862"Up & blessed Adam and called him Michael the Prince the Archangel and the Lord administered comfort unto Adamand said unto him I have set thee to be at the Head a multitude ofNations shall come of thee and thou art a prince over them forever." "And Adam stood up in the midst of the congregationand Notwithstanding he was bowed down with age being full of the Holy Ghost predicted whatsoever should befall his posterityunto the latest generation."  [##Doctrine and Covenants 107:55-56##]THere was Adam and seven of his sons all Aged Patriarchs who lived over nine hundred years Except Mahalealel who lacked five years of Being Nine hundred years of age. [##Genesis 5:16##] Enoch was 365 years of age when he was Translated. [##Genesis 5:23##] Here was that great & glorious meeting of those old Patriarchs and all the History we have of itthose great Prophesies of Adam concerning what should befal his posterity to the End of time is given to us in a fewlines whare is there a latter day Saints who would not be glad to read the Journal & History of that great Event.Abramham and the later Patriarchs & Prophets have left to the world by there Journals and sacred records someHistory of the dealings of God with them. But there recordswere kept upon parchment & papyrus written inEgyptian, Arabic, Chaldecic and Hebrew, mingled with many Hieroglyphics in order to convey their ideas & principles to future generations, some of which have been translated into the English language by the order of King James which now forms the Bible. But what a small History the Bible is of the dealings of God for 4000 years with the Nations of the Earth.Christ Came in the meridian of time to Esstablish the gospel & Kingdom of God upon the Earth. He organized the Church, chose Twelve Apostles also Seventies & set the Church in order with all the gifts graces and blessings. He administered the ordinancesof the gospel, wrought many miracles and finished the work Hewas sent to do. But Jesus Christ with all the saints had to contend with the world the flesh and the devel & Jew & Gentile and the world overcome them and put them to death and the Church 
 1862of Christ disappeared with that generation. What is the Historyof that generation? it is vary short. The four Evangelist Mathew,  Mark, Luke & John, gives the History Biirth life and death of the sSaviour. as near as we can learn Luke keptthe Journals & done most of the writing He recorded the Acts of the Apostles. Then Paul wrote his Epistles to the various churches. Then James wrote one short Epistles. Then Peter wrote two short Epistles about as much as one of our reporters would write in one short discourse. Then Jude wrote one short chapter. Then John the Revelator whenhe was Banished to the Isle of Patmos under the reign of Domician Cezar wrote his Revelations [##Revelation 1:9##] after He was recalled under the reign of Nervya He wrote his three Epistles. this maks 8 writers in the New Testamentand there testimony was vary limited, also their writings as far as they have come to us, at least when we take intoconsideration the great work which they performedThe ancient Jaredites and Nephites who inhabited this con-tinent were commanded of God to write their history upon Brass & Gold Plates which were hid up in the Earth to come forth in our day to be translated by the Prophet Joseph through the powerof God for the benefit of the Saints. This forms the Book of Mormon and is the purest translation of ancient records that wehave any knowledge of upon Earth yet this record gives but a limited Idea of the dealings of God with that People yetwhat we have obtained was by strict commandment of God.But let us turn our thoughts a moment to our own day. I need not tell you that this is the kingdom of God, Esstablishedby God Himself which is to take the place of all other kingdoms upon Earth and we are the People Ordained of God to Esstab-lish his kingdom upon the Earth, build up Zion and preparethe way for the coming of Jeussus Christ. Now should wenot keep a Journal, Record, & History of the dealings of God with [us] as they transpire day by day before our Eyes? we should. This Church & Kingdom is organized in all the fulness of the Holy Priesthood necessary for the 
 1862accomplishment of the work of God in this great and last dispensation of the fulness of times the Church of Christ has been Esstablished in our daywith Prophets, Apostles, Evangelists, Patriarchs, High Priests Elders, Bishops, Priests, Teachers, Deacons, Gifts, gracesRevelations and with all the ordinances Necessary for the salvation of the children of ^men^. Joseph Smith was the the first Apostle, Prophet, Seer, & Revelator called in these last days He brought forth the Book of Mormon and organized the Church of Christ as he was com-manded by the Revelations of Jesus Christ. Whenthe Twelve Apostles were chosen & ordained The Prophet Joseph gave them strict instruction to keep a recordof there procedings (see the History of the Church Feb 1835) The following Extract) "Since the Twelve are now appointed & chosen I wish to tell them a course which they may pursue and be benefitted in one point of light of whichperhaps they are not now aware. At all times whenyou assemble in the capacity of a council to transact business let the oldest preside and let one or more be appo-inted to keep a record of your proceedings, and on thedecision of Every important decission item let it be what it maylet such descision be noted own and they will ever afterwords remain upon record as LAW, Covenant, & doctrin.Questions thus decided might at the time appear unimportantbut should they be recorded and one of you lay hands upon them afterwards you might finds them of infinate worthnot ownly to your Brethren but a feast to your own souls" Many other remarks were made at the same time. The Prophet Joseph always recommended the priesthood to keep a rec-ord of all their Official acts, and among his last letters to the Church before he was slain he urges upon the Church to be particular in there records of the Baptizesms for the dead to be vary particular in there records of there official acts, that what they bound on Earth should be boundin heaven and what they loosed on Earth should be loosed 
 1862in heaven. and what you record on Earth shall be recordedin Heaven. President Brigham Young has also carried out the same Principle since He has been president of the Church, in all of our ordinances, Endowments, sealings and official acts Hewishes us to be particular in recording the same. This Churchis organized with a presidency of 3 men the Twelve Apostlesalso 63 Quorums of Seventies 4,410, Apostles & many thousandsof High Priests, Elders, Bishops, Priests, Teachers, & Deacons. all should keep a Journal of the dealings of God with them andthere officials acts, and keep a true History of Events in this great dispensation. I was inspired & moved upon to write aJournal & keep a record of the affairs of this Church from thetime I first Joined this Church up to the Presient time. I seldomEver heard the Prophet Joseph, or Brigham Young or the Apostlesteach preach or Prophesy or perform any official act butwhat I have recorded it imn my Journals unless some other persons were recording the same, and I could not feel Easyuntill I had accomplished it. I have written more sacredHistory of the teaching of the prophets & Apostles & official actsof the Latter day Sants than would make several Testimentsas large as the one Handed down to us by the Ancient Apostles I have kept a Journal of almost Evry day of my life since I have been a member of this Church. By refering to my Journals I could tell Each day what I have done, the company I have been in, and what was transpiring around me, and any council and Teaching From the Presidency or Twelve Except whare I know there were reporters recording the same. I have urged this same course upon the Twelve & the other Quorums of the Church to keep a record of there meetings & the dealings of God with them and for all men who bear the Holy Pristhood to keep a record of their lives or Esspecially of there official Acts, in the Churchand kingdom of God. Some may say this is a great deal oftrouble But we should not call any thing trouble which brings to pass good. I consider that portion of my life which has been spent in keeping Journals & writing History to have been vary profitably spent. For instance the Lord gives unto us the Holy 
 1862Priestood and we are sent on a mission to the Nations ofthe Earth, we go & Preach the gospel & bring many into the church and the Power of the Holy Ghost rest upon us. We heal thesick, cast out devils, command the Elements & they obeyus & the Lord gives unto us dreams visions & Revelationsand many Blessings should we not have respect Enoughto gGod to make a record of those Blessings which He poursout upon us and Our official acts which we do in hisname upon the face of the Earth? I think we should.For an Example we Embrace in our faith the belief thatthe Ten Tribes of Israel will return from the North Countryunto Zion in the last days suppose that those Israelites shouldcome to Zion in our day Led by the Holy Prophets of Godwhat would be one of the first questions we would ask them? it would be, whare are your records? show is [us] your History we want to read an account of the dealingsof the Lord with you since you were led away underShalmanezar king of Asyria [##2 Kings 18:9-11##] But what would beour disappointment if they should ^say^ O we have not kept any record or account of the great & mighty worksof God among our tribes for many generations, we have herd our Fathers say that thet Lord had done manygreat & marvelous works in there day we have also had great Blessings while on our Journey to Zion from the NorthCountry. The mountains o Ice flowed down before us and there was a Highway cast up for us to walke in as there wasto Israel when they came out of Egypt into the land of Cainan[##Joshua 3:16-17##] and the Nations Trembled at our presence but we did not keepa record of these things we did not think any body wouldbe particularly interested in it but ourselves. should we notbe greatly disappointed at such information? we should &so would it be with them when they come to Zion & Enquirefor the History of this church & kingdom if we were to tellthem that we had not kept any History of the rise & progressof the Church.

 Dec 2nd 1857a late Hour. Brothers Groove and Southworth who had been kept prisioners for some two weeks in the Enemies camp arived home to day. Brother Grove called upon President Youngand related what He knew in the Enemies camp I had a conversation with Brother Southworth concerning his impri-sionment and He said that He was taken prisioner on Green River by an officer in Capt Cooks Horse company & put under Guard with orders for the guard to shoot him if He got 5 paces from him He travelled under guard in this way untill He got to the main Encampment He was then put with the main prisioners of the camp & guarded with the messHe came up with Howard Livingston. He wished Mr Livingston to intercede with Col Johnsoton to let him go home to his family as they had nothing against him ownly that He was a MormonBut Mr Livingston would do nothing for him He reports that their is much of the spirit of Desertion in the camp the officers treat their soldiers in a cruel manner. Capt Cook is considered a Cruel Tyrant & several of his soldiers said ^said^ they would kill him if they had a chance, several soldiers talked with southworth & said they would desert if theycould. He said the greatest amount of any one article in camp was ardent spirits He thought there were 100 waggon loadsHoward Livingston had an outfit of Liquor which cost him ten thousand dollars worth at first cost, and that all the Armey had a great amount as well as all the Suttler's the officers were drunk evry day. He said their was but 2 companies at Bridger guarding that place & thought 100 men could go in the night & take all their was in that Fort. they were 5 days moving their train 6 miles they had not animals enough to move one thirdof their train at the same time and they lost 60 of their best mueles while moving that distance. He says their is a division of the officers as well as the soldiers a portion of them think that Govornor Young is Justified in taking the course He does in his own Defence. He said Col Allexander was an old Granny theGovornor Cummings was a whiskey tub, in appearance about such a man as Brother Blazzard would be if He drank a quart of whiskey per day. Their Animals are dying so fast that they all expect to be on foot before next spring they have sent capt Marcy to Taos to buy mules Horses & oxen the expedit-ion is entirely closed this season and made an Entire faleure of it as far as they are concernedReflectionsWe can now clearly see the Hand of God made visably bear in our behalf concerning the campaign of our Enemies against us this season past. The American Government with James Bucannan at their head as president, have sent forth An Armey of 2,500 men fully armed and Equipt for war for the sole purpose of destroying the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints & the Kingdom of God from off the Earth. This Church and kingdom of God has been driven from themidst of the people in the United States into the vallies of the Rocky Mountains a thousand miles from the confines 
 o Dec 2nd of what is called Gentile Civilization whare they were in hopes we would perish but as soon as they found that we would live & prosper they became alarmed & were resolved upon our destruction and Hence they send theirarmies out to accomplish their Hellish purpose as soon as it was known unto us President Brigham Young the prophet seer and Revelator & leader of the Church and kingdom of God Rose up in the strength of Israel God and proclaimed Israel Free and said they should be Free from that hour if they would obey his council & follow his preceps. His councillors Heber C Kimball & Daniel H Wells and also the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles backed up his Testimony & sustained him in his decissions And all the people said Amen so let it be. President Young testified unto the people in the name of God if they would be United with him in their faith prayers & works that the Enemy Should not have power to come into our valley that the Lord would hedge up their way & we should not be called to shed their Blood neither should they have power to shed oursThis principle president Young has taught from day today when their was evry prospet that the Enemy would try to come. From two to three thousand of the servants of God armed themselves & went into the mountains acco-rding to the council of President Young & they were lead by the valient & Noble General Daniel H Wells to Hedge up the way of the Enemy should they attempt to comein they formed large Entrenchments & ditches & pilledup large masses of Rocks in narrow passes so as to roll them down upon the Enemy & destroy them shouldthey attempt to Come in. But as the Prophets Brigham & Heber had said so it came to pass the Lord fought our Battles & hedged up the way of our Enemies when they Got on Hams Fork 150 miles from our City the storms & cold killed their Horses, Mules, & Cattle by Hun-dreds so that when the whole armey got together with the Govornor & Judges who had been sent by the Government to rule & tyranize over us they had not got team enough left alive to draw one third of their trains so they are obliege to stop & spend thewinter in the storms of the mountains & their wisdom is taken away so that they are not capable of writing a letter or Document in a proper manner and this the Lord has done in answer to the prayers of his Saintsand our brethren have been enabled to Heard them likea herd of cattle & they have shot grape musket & minnie balls at them from time to time & those Balls have flown like hail around the servants of God & not a drop of Blood shed neither have the Brethren returned the fire upon the Enemy in no instance.

What I have tosay I speak right on without any regard to the Poets measure or rhyme, or law, or order; Thou hast spread thy thoughtson Paper for men to read: I have read them many an hour, they have stired my soul with thoughts, deep thoughts,thoughts which could not be born. Thy soul hath been inspired with the spirit of God, and Eternal light and truth and Noble sentiment and God has given thee gifts to utterthem. Thy lamp hath been lit at Gods Holy altar whare the oil was pure and the spirit free so thou couldst weighEternal truth and tell it unto men. Why hath this talent this choice gift been given unto thee Eliza. Ah the spirit whispersit was to cheer the heart of aA Prophet A Patriarch, An Apostlein the dark hours of Gloom. It was to give the Lords Anointeda ray of light, and a consoleing thought while Hells dark Billows rolled around in the midst of wicked men and Devils who continuallycry out and say that no kingdom on the Earth shall belong to God. [FIGURE] It was to tell the assassins of Missouri and Illinois in streams of Living fire that the Judgments of God awaitedtheir guilty souls and that there Judgment had begun. It wasto tell the wicked Nation who now Pollute the sacred soil of Joseph that when their cup was full they would find a grave there to remain untill called to Judgment by the trump of God. Hast thou not been faithful in thy mission to Earth. Yesthe spirit whispers Yes. Many an hour has Joseph spent in gloomand sorrow because of Fals Brethren and wicked men, even thehearts of the saints were so barred by fals tradition that He could not unbosom his soul in the House of his Friends. This causedhim pain. Then thou dist comfort him. Thy frendly thoughtsand acts and words inspired by Gods Eternal truth was likea flaming shaft though launch by a female hand, that handwas nerved by faith and power that it pierced the walls ofDarkness fear and death and gave the Prophet Joy. But whocan tell the best deeds of a true friend in time of need, NoneThey are not told in time, but like gold in the mine are concealed from vhuman view, if known at all the Judgmentmust reveal them. Thou hast been a true Friend and com-forted the Heart of Joseph, Hiram, Brigham, Heber, Willard,Jedediah, Thy Brother Lorenzo and thousands of the saints I need not name them. Thy words and testimony will live and speakin flames of Holy fire to inspire the Hearts of Prophets Apos-tles and Holy men of God to noble Deeds, and steal [steel] the nerve of many a Noble Son of Zion. to avenge the Blood of the Prophets and martyrs of Jesus Christ, long after thou art with thy Fatherin heaven clothed with Immortality and crowned with LightThy Pen hath pierced many a wicked withheart with barbed darts which no Earthly power could remove. Thou hast freelytold the wicked their doom and warned them of approachingJudgment. Thy garment are clear of the Blood of all men. 
 Thy testimony will remain on histories page and be numbered among the prophets of God as one of the noble spiritswhom God has sent through the Loins of Abraham and Josephto fulfill a Noble mission upon the Earth in the last dispensation and fulness of times. God Bless Thee Noble Muse. Thy soulis as pure as the criystleal stream that flows from its snowy bed. Out of the Heart the mouth speaketh. The thoughts of thy soul are before the world to read Let them read. It will live when they are Dead. Continue to let the inspiration of thy soul be given unto men. Haste thy mission here upon Earth. For Eloheam, Jehovah, Michael Angels seraphs Apostles Prophets Thy Father and Mother Brethren and sisters await thy coming with Joy. Thou hast been true and faithful and art sealed unto Eternal life and secured unto thyself a Crown of glory. No Power shall take it. It awaits thy comingSoon this Blessing will be thine. Ah what Joy what consolationwho can comprehend it None but a saint. Soon will thou Enjoy this Blessing. Did I say soon, Yes not because I expet thee toleave us. But shouldst thou remain to see Zion Redeemed(which ma^y^ God grant) and her Enemies conquered and sin and sinners find a grave, and Zions Land be cleansed and the Temple of our God in Jackson County be reared, clothed with the Power of God, with her towreers marked with a pillar of fireby night and a cloud by day, And the way prepared for the coming of the Son of Man, it will be soon.

Erastus Snow then Albert Carrington read the Govornor message to the Legislative Assemblyin the Afternoon D. H. Wells followed by H. C. Kimball I attended the prayer meeting in the evening 
 December 21, 1857 ~ MondayDec 21stMonday I met with the Legislative council most of the time in the Joint session. Resolutions were offerd upon the merits of the Govornors Message which resolutions were like a Declaration of independance against wicked and ungodly men this drew speeches from John Taylor G. A. Smith W. Woodruff O. Hyde, H. Stout, Bishop Rowberry J. C. LitleW W Phelps &c many interesting remarks were made G A. Smith said it was a grave question before us and one of vast import if we carry out these resolutions we may prepare our necks for the Halter if our Enemies catch us I am in for the measure because it is right the United States are determined to destroy the Mormons if it is in their power but we have to defend our-selves. In the remarks which I made I said I did not think their ever was an Assembly of men on Earth that deliberated upon so weighty a subject upon which hung such important consequences with the same feeling which pervades the boso-ms of this assembly. for all that we possess in this life inclu-ding all our lives are couched in this important subjet yet evry mind is calm and serene and not a disenting vote or voice, why is this, when Our Fathers set in solumn convention upon the subject of our Declaration of Independance they knew well that their cause was just, yet it required the strongest talent and argumet and language was exherted to bring that august body of senators to agree as a unit in putting their names to that sacred instrument; ^the^ speech of sir Patrick Henry was a masterly Effort of talent & oritory upon that solumn occasion. It does not require any argument with this body of men to convince them what course to persue, what causes this difference they were inspired by the Lord to step forth to esstablish an Independant Government in America, but this body of Men are far more inspired by the same God to esstablish the Kingdom of God upon the Earth and lay a foundation for the Liberty and salvation of our children and to lift up a standard for the oppressed of all nations Our path is marked out as plain asto our view as is our broad street or the missippii River to the natural Eye. The same Godwho inspired our Fathers to esstablish a Free governmentsaid through the prophet Joseph Smith that if ever the constitu-tion of the United States or its principles were ever preserved it would have to be done by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints even the servants of God Holding the Holy priesthood. that day has now come & the day is dawning when we are called to act the same God who has destroyed two Nations who have dwelt upon this continent because of their iniquity, has also said that all other Nations who should occupy this continant when they were ripened in iniquity should in like manner be cut off from the earthand not left to pollute the Land of Joseph or the Land ofZion I do not know what Els our Nation can do in orderin order to fill up their cup of iniquity than what they have done and are doing. I do not know of any other key the United States can turn to seal fast their condemnation than the Exertions which they are makeing to destroy the saints of God for their religion I am in For the measure because it is right 
 Dec 21stThe council adjourned till wednesday 23December 22, 1857 ~ Tuesday232nd Met in the office with G. A.

After transacting the business of the day we adjourned untill the 4th day of January. I have been troubled for several days with severe pain in one of my Eye teeth I had takencold & it had setled in my Jaw & tooth and it was swoolen & much inflamed. I called upon a Dentist and had it pulled as soon as He pulled it my Mouth filled with Blood He gave me a cup of cold water to rens my mouth I spit out the Blood & filled my mouth with cold water it struck my brain numb like a stroak of the Palsey for a few seconds the then the numness left me and at each beat of the pulse a [FIGURE] A Pain went through my Brain like an Arrow or a thunder bolt for the term of two hours untill it appeared as though my head would burst. This pain continued in my head untill I covered my head with hot potatoe poultice & got into a high state of perspiration. I never before heard of an instance of this kind. I reason upon it thus that it being an Eye tooth & taking cold water into my mouth before the goum had closedthe water chilled the nerve runing from the thooth through the Eye to the Brain and the cold Blood was instantly carried to the Brain which created a concussion which was both excruciating and dangerous had the water been warm instead of cold nosuch effect would have been produced. Let surgeon & Dentist observe this rule when pulling Eye teeth use warm water instead of coldDecember 24, 1857 ~ Thursday24 I spent the day in the office on the Dr papers mostly & scrapingDecember 25, 1857 ~ Friday25th Christmast I spent the day in the office writing Journal & History it was vary quiet in the streets through the dayI had a supper at my own house and spent the evening with my children in an agreeable mannerDecember 26, 1857 ~ Saturday26th I heard an Early report this morning that the socil Hall was on fire I soon went over and found the room occupied by the Legislative ACouncil nearly burned up and a part of the chairs it smoaked up the whole House it will cost several Hundred dollars to repair it I spent the day in the office on HistoryDecember 27, 1857 ~ Sunday27th Sunday I attended meeting at the Tabernacle.

 Stanley Buildings, Bath Street LiverpoolAug 5th 1845Beloved Brother PrattI recieved your lettersome time since but have delayed untill SisterBeer's return as I could then forward by privateconveyance. Elder Clark was with me ths afternoonI read him your letter he says you left a bill for him& Felding to pay at Carns & [Borown] which they paid accordingto agreement. But he said there was No arangementsmade with him about the flour. He says as far as theirwas any arrangements made with him about any business heattended to it, but what was left with Br Fielding hecould not say anything about. I also read the lettr to BrWard and he did not know of any business left with himbut what he had attended to. It seems you left the paymentof the flour with Fielding but he has not attended to itI do not know of any debts now standing against youin this country but the flour the names of the lastthat were shiped that had paid you were William Gittins& family they claimed £16.16.0 which was allowed them intheir passage.I spoke to Br Brown about his Box of hard warethat he shiped to you & I believe he has writtenfor somebody els to pay duties & sell it for what itwill fetch. I dont think myself that you ought to betroubled with things of that kind. The Acada broughtme papers from Nauvoo the first No of the New York Messengertwo letters from Boston, one from Eldr Grant of Philadelphia 
 & one from my Father in Connecticut all of which Iwas glad to get as they contained much good & CheeringNews. I was glad to hear that you had againreturned to printing. I hope you will be supportedin it. As to the work in this country it is still onthe increase. the Churches generally are well umited [united]& increasing in Numbers. there are some few exceptionbut wha[r]e this is the case it is for the want of faithfulElders to labour. I suppose the Saints in this countrywill now number near 11,000 thousands scattered over avast country & their is but about six 6 American Eldersthat are in the whole field beside 2 or 3 of us at Liverpool& Hence their is much more labour resting upon mein answering a peck [pack] of letters or so Daily & keeping thingsin order than their would be if we could have one ^100^ hundredgood wise Jusdicious men who had recceved their Endowment& would act for the good of the Kingdom I feel anxious to see such a day that I can strike hands with menfrom Nauvoo who has recceved their Endowment thatwill come to my help. what Elders there are in the fieldhere are doing Exceding well but are soon expecting to returnHome & I will then nearly be left alone as far aslabour in the vineyard a^i^s concerned. If We can holdour own untill more help arives from Nauvoo Ishall think we do well. the Lord has been with meon this mission & is still with me. I hope I shall stae [stay]in the prayers of all the Lords Anointed. It has been 
 much consolation to me in the perusal of the prophetto learn that Br Parley has backed up my teaching &testimony which I gave to the Saints in the New EnglandChuches in my visit with them on my way to EnglandI saw it was necessary for some such man asBr Parley to preside over that region & my soul rejoicedwhen I herd you was there. I am glad ElderBrannan is restored. I think he will be much help toyou in [printing], I think he will listen to yourcouncil. give my love to him & all the Saints whoinquire after me. I wish you would send the New YorkMessenger to my Father (Aphek Woodruff FarmingtonHartford county Connecticut) & Betsey Cossett of Sismsbury Hartford co Connecticut) & continue to to forward them to me at (Standley Bu^i^ldings Bath [S]t [page torn]Liverpool) & I will pay you for the three volumsWe will forward the Star to you regular.There is quite an Excitement at present in Englandabout the Texas question & Oregon whether they willmake war out of it at present or not I do not know.

 Historian's Office, Great Salt Lake City, June 30th, 1856Elder John Taylor,Dear Brother,We are very busy writing the history of the latter days ofJoseph, and we have a great many conflicting statements on the subject,which renders it necessary for me to call in the aid of an eye and earwitness to enable me to do justice to it. You are the only person onearth who can render me this assistance; I shall therefore feel obliged if youwill take the earliest opportunity to sit down with your Hon. colleague the ChiefHistorian, and write out an account of all the circumstances relating to thissubject which came under your immediate observation or experience fromthe 20th June 1844 to the date of  your return from Carthage to Nauvoo.Also please to give me the requisite information if you are able on the followingpoints:Who were the Apostates staying at Hamilton's Hotel at the time in question?At what period did Robinson stop the mail?Joseph, Willard, and yourself tasted of the wine which was fetched by the guardjust previous to the martyrdom; did Hyrum taste of it?Were you the mouth at prayer both evenings in jail? if not, who officiatedthe first night, if any?You sung "A poor wayfaring man of grief" at a quarter past 3 PM ofthe 27th; was it Joseph or Hyrum who requested you to repeat it? Ihave always understood that you had no sooner finished singing it thesecond time than the firing commenced; if so there must have been aconsiderable interval between the two exercises. What were the facts?Who washed the bodies in Carthage?Who nailed the boards together in which to take the bodies to Navuoo? 
 Elder Orson Pratt  G. S. L. City Feby. 2 1857Dear Bro,The Eastern mail for Jan. last started, and wentabout 11 miles to the top of the first mountain and returned, one of theparty (not a mormon) having been froze to death in the snow, we havenot yet received any Eastern mail for the past months.Judge Phelps reports the entire fall of snow in the city up to the 24th. inst, has been over eight feet.  We have more snow in themountains than we have ever known since our arrival in the vallies.It had lain for several weeks in this valley between 2 & 3 feet deep.  Manyhave brought their cattle from the ranges Northward, also all the stockof horses, cattle and sheep have been brought from the Island - as snowis reported as being nearly 3 feet deep there - and fed them at home, &large herds have been driven south into Utah Valley, some cattle havedied, but as yet few in comparison to what died last Winter.The work of the Reformation is progressing throught this city &Territory.  President Young has given much valuable information duringthis winter to the Twelve and the people, the Spirit and power of God hasrested upon him, and his whole soul has been filled with charity, mercy,long suffering, kindness, and a fatherly feeling towards his bethren and the whole of this people, and his heart made glad in seeing the people ina measure beginning to awake to a realizing sense of thier duties, and begin-ning to feel the importance of magnifying their calling in the Priesthood andof building up the kingdom of God.

 Historian's Office,Great Salt Lake City, May 28th 1856Dear Bror. O. Pratt,As I commence my first letter in the Historian's Office,I feel that you are the person that I should write to.You may be aware that on Monday, the day before I parted withyou at the mouth of the Kanyon, that I had an ox die suddenly,and in my endeavors to save the hide, while skinning it, I casuallyscratched my left arm with a rib, and a few days afterwards the placeinflamed; a swelling rose on the spot, the poison virus got inoculatedinto my system, which caused me 3 to 4 weeks' sickness, and which camevery near costing me my life. About the first labor on my recoveringso as to be able to get out of doors, was to be called up about midnighton Thursday the 15th. inst to administer to your wife Sarah; I promised herin the name of the Lord that all should be well with her and her child,and she should be blest in her labor. In 15 minutes after she wassafely delivered of a very fine daughter, weighing 12 lbs. I have seenher several times since, both she and her daughter are doing well.I have now so far recovered from my sickness as to be able to attendto business.Eighteen days ago the mail arived from the East, being the firstnews by way of the South Pass since last November; the Carrier onlybrought in about one half of the bags sent from Independence [Using] thatline; the other half being cached somewhere between there andhere; perhaps left at Fort Laramie to amuse the U. S. soldiers withour news and correspondence during the winter evenings.The California mail has arrived pretty regularly this winter; by that mail we receive the Western Standard, and letters from Bro Rich

 Two sets of messengers were sent from Carthage on the evening of the 27thwith the melancholy news to Nauvoo. What were their names, distinguishingthose who were turned back by Governor Ford?Dan Jones makes the following statement: "We were awoke [during the nightof the 26th] by heavy treads as of soldiery close by, and heard a whisperingunder the window 'who shall go in? how many shall go in? &c'.  They came upstairs to the prison door, ^against^ which we had taken the precaution to place a chair;hearing us speaking to each other they hesitated, when Joseph called out,'come on ye assassins! we are ready for you, and would as willinglydie now as at daylight!' Hearing this they retired again."Do you know anything of this, and if so, how far is the statement correct?Jones says that he was sent down stairs by Joseph the first thing next morningto ascertain the cause of the disturbances in the night, and was addressed bythe officer of the guard (Frank Worrell) as follows: "we have had too muchtrouble to bring old Joe here to let him ever escape alive, and unless you wantto die with him you had better leave before sundown; and you are not a damnedbit better than him for taking his part, and you'll see that I can prophesy betterthan old Joe, for neither he nor his brother, nor any one who will remainwith them will see the sun set to day."  He says Joseph then directed himto go to Governor Ford and inform him of what had taken place, and whathad been said by the officer of the guard. How much of this is correct?Jones says that the last words spoken on the evening of the 25th afteryou had all retired to rest were by Joseph as follows: "Now see who willhave the most intelligent dream to night, brethren"; and that on awakeningnext morning Joseph enquired who had the dream; when Jones himself relatedone as follows: "Pourtrayed before my mind was Governor Ford and his troupeon their way across the prairie to Nauvoo. The prisoners had intreated in vain

 Sundays past the assembly has been addressed by Prest. Kimball atlength in great plainness upon various subjects; he has been clothedwith the Spirit and power of God, so that he has truly satisfiedhis mind upon any subject, not regarding any false traditions, weor our fathers may have imbibed, and the people are edified andbenefitted by what they hear, the ward school houses are all crowdedto excess during the evening meeting.  Brother W. D. Richards & myself beingthe only one of the Twelve in the city, we organized the missionarieswith the assistance of Prest. Grant, under the directions of Prest. Youngto preach throughout this city, all the Wards during Winter have metin the school houses several evenings in the week, to hear the wordof the Lord.  We have attended a meeting of some kind about everyevening for the last 3 months, we meet with the Seventies, High Priests,Bishops, and ward meetings weekly, our preaching is mostly confinedto reformation, repentance, confession and forsaking of sin, baptism forthe remission of sins, living our religion, magnifying the Priesthood,prizing the blessings which God has given us, paying our Tithing,seeking first the kingdom of God and building it up, and mani-festing our faith by our works and trusting in the Lord for ourblessings.  Elders O. Hyde & L. Snow were with us during the settingof the Legislature and they have joined us in our missionary labors &the Spirit & power of God has rested upon us in our labor.  ElderHyde has gone South on a mission and the people almost en massare rising up in the city, and in the country and are engaging in the reform-ation, confessing their sins and  restoring what they have done wrong.  Meetingsare crowded, confidence is being restored and a more healthy atmosphere issensibly felt, and strong determinations are expressed by the brethren tolive their religion, practice virtue and righteousness, and put down sin &iniquity in all its forms. 
 and the saints who are coming from the old countries, a sufficiency offood for the next year.Elder P. P.

 to return with him, although he had promised that they should go. With a letter ofimportance I saw myself driven from Carthage, galloping through the masses of mostlysoldiers, half Indians and semi barbarians. I hurried across the prairie, hadgone down on a boat from Nauvoo towards Quincy, but while landed at Warsawawoke in the midst of powder, smoke, death, and carnage." After he hadfinished the recital of the dream he says that Joseph remarked, "that is ominousof future events. I do not believe that the Governor will ever take me to Nauvooalive."Do you remember this? and if not, what is your opinion respecting it?The following is copied from Dr. Willard Richard's journal, and you willperceive it is a meagre report of the interview with the Governor in Carthage jail;as you were present you will doubtless be able to fill most of the blanks:"Thursday, June 26th, 1844. 9:27^AM^ A.M.

 and others. I am very much pleased with the appearance of theStandard; it is ably conducted, and I think it will prove a benefitto the Saints, and help to keep at bay some of our vile columniatorswho will not be so bare faced in their attacks when they see we havea paper that will defend our cause.We learn by the late mails that there is much trouble in Oregon andWashington Territories; the Indians are having it pretty much all theirown way. I am happy to say by recent articles from our missionariesin East Oregon, that all is peace with them. Prest. Young has talkedof sending up about 14 Wagons to bring back loads of dried salmon tohelp out the scanty supplies of food in this country. Bro C. C. Rich is alsomaking calculations to furnish some grain for this Territory in case we gettoo tightly pinched; but we feel thankful to our Heavenly Father for hisgracious mercies in sending us a beautiful shower every week since Prest.J. M. Grant spoke upon "the dry moon", and exhorted the brethren to exercisefaith for rain, which you may remember, when it commenced rainingwhile he was preaching. The past week has been very warm, and wheatis running fast; many brethren are in high glee, and are calculatingto commence cutting wheat about the 20th of June. The cut worm isdevouring a portion of the wheat and corn crops. The peas are beginningto bloom beautifully; the potatoes and other crops are growing fine. Atthe same time we have the music of the gulls as they fly over our heads seekingfor grasshoppers, crickets, and other insects, but they find very few to feedupon. There is a greater abundance of grass in all the valleys andmountains than we have had for two years. We can say the brethren continuebusy planting corn and late crops, and all the old broke land is being cropped,which shows an untiring zeal in those who remain to secure for themselves

 G. S. L. City Feby. 2 1857.Editor of the Western StandardDear brother,After so much of a hard and snowy winter, un-equalled since we settled in these mountains, the past few days of sunnyweather almost make us believe Spring has commenced; over 8 feet of snowhas fallen this winter in our city. The snow has been 2 & 3 feet deepin our streets during the month of January; Northward it has beendeeper: In Utah valley South there has not been so much. The cattleand sheep have been brought from the island where snow is about 3feet deep, and many have been driven into the city from the ranges NorthFew have died in comparison to last year.The abundance of snow in the mountains will be of muchbenefit the coming year for irrigation, and with such a gradual warmthaw as is going on at present, the land must receive a thoroughsoaking, which is cheering prospects to a community whose primary &chief dependence is Agricultural.The Eastern mail for January made an attempt at crossingthe mountains for the East, but only got up the first mountain whereon finding the snow so very deep it was considered impracticable toproceed further. They returned finding one carrier froze to death in thesnow.Elder Dan Jones has been employed while the weather wouldpermit in fitting up a craft with which to explore Salt Lake, and themouths of Bear river and the Jordan, and to find what navigation ispracticable on the Lake and its tributaries, he is at present makingarrangements to boat fire wood from Stansbury Island to Black rock,from which point it can easily be drawn into the city.

The Spirit and powerof God has rested upon him, and his whole Soul has been filled withmercy, charity & brotherly kindness towards this people, and his heart has beenmade glad, and his Spirit cheered to see the people rise up en masse andmanifest a strong determination to live their religion, repent and forsakeall their sins, and put away evil of every kind out of the midst ofIsrael. The people appear to feel the importance of awakening to arealizing sense of their duties, and magnifying their calling in theHoly Gospel and Priesthood. The Tabernacle on the Sabbath has beencrowded to overflowing during the winter, and hundreds have to re-turn home who cannot get a chance to either sit or stand in thehouse. The assembly has been addressed during the winter mostlyby the Presidency & Twelve, and the Spirit and power of Revelationinspiration, teaching and counsel has rested upon them, and the heartsof thousands who were honest before God have been made glad throughtheir words, while the wicked and ungodly have been made to fear andquake and fearfulness has surprized the hypocrite, because of the plainnessof the word of God which has been made manifest in Zion. PresidentBrigham Young has not been able to attend in the Tabernacle sincehe attended the funeral of J. M. Grant on the 4th December untillast Sunday the 1st inst. when his appearance in the stand created a deepsensation throughout the vast assembly, who were congregated in the

 Tabernacle. He addressed the people for about one hour and a halfwith the power of God and his discourse was very instructive, andedifying, and the people deeply felt the force of his teachings uponpractical religion, honoring God, bringing ourselves in subjection tothe law of God, & rightly prizing the blessings which he bestows uponus. The loss man will meet with by committing sin, breaking hiscovenants and disobeying his Heavenly Father. He was followed by Presidents H. C. Kimball and D. H. Wells who spoke much to the edification of thepeople all of which will appear in the Deseret News. For several sabbathsprevious, the assembly has been addressed by President Kimball, who has spokeupon several subjects in great plainness, without any regard to any false tra-ditions which the people may have imbibed, and the people have been muchinstructed and benefitted in the plain teachings which they have received thiswinter. The Twelve have gone forth at the head of the Missionariesthroughout every ward in this city during the winter, attending Ward meetingsand meetings with the various quorums of the church in the Reformation,and I have spent one of the most interesting scenes of my life. I haveattended a meeting of some kind almost every evening for three months, andthe Lord has labored with us and we think much good has been done. Thefruits of it are manifest among the people, and we are enjoying a healthyatmosphere, and the people seem determined to practice virtue and holiness andto put down vice and iniquity in all its forms.I wish to give our friend Wm. C. Dodge credit for forwardingme a bottle of Quince cuttings, and a few black prince Strawbury roots, nothaving received any line or note with them, I had no explanation what kind of Quinces the were, we have but few Quinces growing as yet inour city, we will graft them into what we have. I have a few whichbloomed last season but have not yet developed any fruit. I discover from

 Wm. R. Prince's catalogue of Strawberries, that the black princesuch as was sent me was classed among the rejected lot, and thatkind especially pointed out as unproductive, yet I shall take careof them and see what they will produce. I would like very much toobtain some of Hovey's seedlings as they are counted first class fruit, or anyother good kinds. We would also like to obtain some Indigo & madder seed,from some of our california friends, if it can be obtained, as we wouldlike to make a trial of it in this Territory. We want to get enoughIndigo seed for over two acres as a trial. We have some of the chinesesugar cane seed which will be tryed by several persons the ensuing seasonand I am requested to say that if any of our friends in San Bernardinoor California who are coming through this Spring will bring cotton seedsufficient to plant 5 or 6 acres they shall be amply rewarded for thesame.yours truly,W.
