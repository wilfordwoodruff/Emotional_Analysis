I saw a mountain with lots of light coloured loose rock on the surface, so I took several pieces home and burnt them to see if it would make good lime; when burnt to my surprise I saw specks of gold the size of a pin-head more or less at short distances all over the rock; I went and brought more from diferent parts a number of steps apart which on being burnt sparkled, some of them however with other metal as I had taken a variety of rock, some of them very dark colour and very heavy; while the first mentioned when burned pulverize very easily.  I pulverized one rock, washed off some of the dirt that would swim when stired and put a little quicksilver with the other, afterward passed the quicksilver through cloth which left quite a dusting of gold on the cloth.

I am opposed to bringing the outsiders to our  settlements; but many of our men are most all or a great portion of their time on the road and in the camps with provissions at about the price it is worth at home; and thus we are extreemly poor.  We have many good purposes in our hearts but short of means to carry them into practice.  I have long saw the need of a cement for  roofs instead of shingles (which take the best of our  timber) I have found the material or the knowledge how to combine articles to form a substance near like indiarubber; I have tested it except by the action of frost; I think it is of too flexible a nature for frost to effect it much.  Should be willing to place the knowledge in the reach of our people for general use or that it may be easily obtained by the poorest of our people, of course If I exported all the material from here and no railway it would be more expense than to save very much of the material in most of the settlements, ^it is thought of no value by the people generally;^  some of the material would have to be made in the localaties where the fat pine exist; I know how to make the tar and pitch and could supply a very large ammount, and would teach others where it is expedient and they have not the knowledge.

(Northern portion of the Sangre de Cristo Grant.)  The Sangre de Cristo Grant occupies most of the  eastern and southern portion of the San Luis Valley in  Southern New  Mexico. Its title is perfect and a United States patent  has been issued therefor, as Grant No.4, containing 998,780.  46 acres.  It is bounded on the northest and east by the  crest of the Sangre de Cristo range of mountains, and its  western boundary consists chiefly of the Rio Grande. The  Grant between the mountains and river averages 30 miles  wide, and extends north and south some 50 or 60 miles.  Blanea Peak, in the Sangre de Cristo range, the  highest mountain in Colorado -- and probably in the United  States -- (14,483 feet high) is the most prominent landmark  on the northern boundary ogf the property. The Sangre de  de Cristo Grant was cut into two almost equal parts by the  owners several years ago, and the lower half of the Grant,  consisting of 500,000 acres, was sold.  The division line  extends from a point north of the Culebra Peak on the east  due west to the Rio Grande, passing four miles north of the  Town of San Luis on the Rio Culebra.

Since the di- vision the lower portion has been known as the Costilla Es- tate and the upper portion as the Trinchera Estate.  The Denver and Rio Grande Railroad enters the Trin- chera Estate at the summit of Veta Pass and traverses it in  a generally south-westerly direction for about thirty miles,  almost bisecting it. Fort Garland, the military post of  the San Luis Valley, is situated near the center of the Es- tate and now belongs to the owners of the Grant.  The accompanying map, which is an exact copy of the  official map accompanying the patent, shows better than any  description can do, the relative extent of mountains and val- ley land; also the boundary line between the two proper- ties.  For practical purposes the property may be divided  into irrigable and farming land, grazing land and the moun- tainous portion.  The irrigable farming land is mostly situated along  the Trinchera and streams tributary thereto, and the finest  portions will be found above and below Fort Garland, extend- ing in each direction several miles, watered by Ute Creek  and other tributaries of the Trinchera.  There is also some  good irrigable land which can be covered by ditches taken  out of the Rio Grande, both above and below the mouth of the  Trinchera.  The soil is mostly a rich sandy loam, and wherever  water is obtainable, yields abundance of fine nutritious hay, ENDENTRY April 25 1889 Wilford Woodruff Clark Georgetown Rcd May 1 1889  Accepts Mission ENDENTRY Aug 29 1889 Walter Hoge.

The streams which  rise from the lofty mountains above refered to are so nume- rous that the entire property is amply supplied with water  at convenient distances for stock purposes as well as for ir- rigation where the lay of the land is suitable for that pur- pose. Usually, during the summer months the cattle frequent  the open country lying between the foothills and the Rio  Grande. In winter they retire from the open country and  are to be found grazing in the sheltered nooks of the hills  and throughout the broken ground which covers the eastern and  southeastern portions of the Estate. The foot hills and  mountains slopes in several localities are covered with good  timber for building purposes, which timber lands, unless  very inaccessible, are valuable throughout Colorado, at all  events wherever they occur within twenty miles of a railroad.  There is much good tie timber in many parts of the Estate.  Much of the land between the mountains and the open  plain is covered with cedar, from which vast quantities of  cedar posts can be obtained.  Such posts are very valuable,  and yearly becoming more so.  The mountains which form the northeastern and east- ern boundary of the property are mineral bearing in their  character, and form part of the extended range which reaches  beyond Santa  Fe on the south, in which many prominent mines exist.

The exact acreage cannot be stated, because  small sales are constantly being made to settlers.  The nearest town of importance is Alamosa, situated  on the Rio Grande, about 12 miles north of the point where  the northwestern boundary of the property touches the river.  This town seems destined to become one of considerable size.   It is already a railway center, from which one branch of the  D. and R. G. R'd extends up the Rio Grande to Del Norte and  Wagon Wheel qgap, another southward which divides shortly af- ter leaving Alamosa, one branch running through the San Juan  country to Silverton, and the other continuing  directly south to Espanola, in New Mexico, and thence direct  to Santa Fe by a connecting line.  No difficulty is likely to arise with respect to  squatters on the property. There are four, or at most five  farmers whose rights have been recognized by the owners of  the Grant to the extent of 160 acres each, because they set- tled on the property at a very early date, and have rendered  various services to the owners. These parties have receiv- ed deeds for their land upon paying the government price  therefor. A few miners have acquired clearly defined rights  under contract with the owners of the Grant, who offered in- ducements to parties to prospect for mineral within the lim- its of the Estate.  Much attention has lately been directed to the San  Luis Valley, and large irrigating canals are in course of  contruction by the Colorado Loan and Trust Company and other ENDENTRY Salt Lake City July 29th 1890  President W.

You may write it upon the tablets of your memory, and in your Book, you may engrave it with the pen of iron and lay it in the rock forever, that the Lord God spake, and said unto me, that "All things whatsoever that is  done in my name from this time forth, that is not for the gathering of the whole House of Israel, is not from me saith the Lord of Hostes  Now Holy Brethren condesend to to hear council from one obscure, humble and lowly, The Spirit dictates me to say, the end of Joseph's dispensation is near at hand and a new one soon to usher in, wherein the Saints must stand in Holy places and wait the coming of the Lord, which he, the Prophet Joseph foresaw and was permitted to know the time ^(of the comeing dispensation)^ viz fifty six years after the going forth of the Apostles to prune the vinyard for the last time  Now the Spirit presses me to council ENDENTRY Ditch Companies, for the purpose of irrigating large blocks  of land situated to the south and west of Alamosa, which the  last named Company has recently purchased from the State.  Such active development on a large scale cannot fail to in- crease the value of the Trinchera Estate, which is contigu- ous to those lands.  Following the example of the large ditch companies  operating on the western side of the San Luis Valley the  Trinchera Estate Company commenced surveys in 1887, covering  the greater portion of the Estate, and early in 1888 it con- structed two main irrigating canals, one called Garland Ditch  and the other The Trinchera Ditch.  The Garland Ditch is take from the Sangre de Cristo stream about a mile east and  above Fort Garland. It extends some seven miles in a gene- ral northwestern direction, taking in on its way the waters  of Ute Creek, and covering a magnificent body of farming  land. This canal, as required, can be extended for several  miles further. Its exact location is marked on the map.  The Trinchera Ditch is taken out of the stream of the same  name -- a fine stream -- just where it leaves the foot hills  and enters the plain, and runs in a southwesterly direction  to cover another body of fine land. It has been constructed  for a distiance of five or sxx miles, that can be extended as  required. Reservoir sites have been selected for the stor- age of water whenever it may be found necessary to do so.  About 16,000 acres of land have been sold to set- tlers up to January 1st; for which the Company holds defer- red payment notes amounting to about $34,000. ENDENTRY Nephi 2/4/90  To Prest W.

ENDENTRY In order to raise funds for surveys, canals and o- ther improvements, a loan of $20,000 was effected, on mort- gage of a small portion of the property not immediately re- quired for colonization purposes. This money, together with first payments on land sales, has all been judiciously  used for the advancement of the property; so that the Es- tate is infinitely more valuable now than it was three years  ago.  Amongst the improvements the location of the new  Town of Fort Garland must not be overlooked.  This new Town  is situated on the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad immediate- ly north of the old military post, and will probably become  the County seat next autumn. Town lots are being sold here  on the deferred payment plan.  In connection with the sale of agricultural lands  to settlers, water rights are also sold; and from these wa- ter rights a large revenue will doubtless be obtained. At  present these water rights are sold at $3 an acre.  The  ruling price, however, throughout the San Luis Valley is $5;  but inasmuch as the canals of the Company did not cost as  much as is usually the case, it was deemed best to commence  at a low figure and gradually increase the price.  The northwestern boundary of the property has been  substantially fenced with cedar posts and barbed wire for a- bout thirty miles.  Herewith are the forms of water right and land con- tracts in use.

But the information it contained saying my name had been suggested as a missionary to Great Britain, caused me such a feeling of sorrow and dread, on account of a feeling to shun society, or of being shy, nor never having been away from home. You can judge my feelings better then I can explain them. But be it ever so great a task, and although thinking  I can do no good. But to be obedient I will try and be there, as stated in the letter, if not otherwise notified.  C. A.
