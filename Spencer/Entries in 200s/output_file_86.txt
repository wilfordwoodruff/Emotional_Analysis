 John E. Isgreen  July 18 [18]97. 
 PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF:    He had listened with attention to the  remarks of the previous speakers. He  had not time to dwell upon the virtues  of the deceased nor the consequences  upon the nation for the shedding of  the blood of the Lord's anointed.   John the Revelator beheld, in his vision  on the Isle of Patmos, the altar of God  and under it the souls of them that  were slain for the word of God, and  for the testimony they held. And they  cried with a loud voice, saying, "how  long, O Lord, holy and true, dost not  thou not judge and avenge our blood  on them that dwell on the earth?" They  were told that they must "rest yet  for a little season until their fellow  servants also, and their brethren that  should be killed also as they were,  should be fulfilled." Eighteen hundred  years had elapsed and their brethren  were being slain for their testi-  mony. The speaker had witnessed  many scenes like the present. He  hoped he would not be called upon to  behold many more, because they were  most sorrowful. Persecution had been  directed against all people who had  lived in godliness, and we were having  our turn. The Gospel fulness had been   restored in these latter days through  Joseph Smith. The Prophet lived   fourteen years after he organized this  kingdom, and by him every key of the  Priesthood had been restored and was  now held by men. We were command-  ed to preach the Gospel, the principles  of which were unpopular. It is the  same now as it was in the days of Jesus  and His Apostles. If those who per-  secuted and slew them had known  what would have been the result to the   Jewish nation, they would not have  acted as they did. So it is to-day with  this nation. We would be under con-  demnation did we not declare the mes-  sage we have to deliver. The Elders  are sent forth without purse of scrip  and these two who have been slain in  Tennessee would receive a martyr's   crown. It was infinitely more desira-  ble to be in their position than that of  those who produced their death. It   was now as anciently; the servants of  God are called upon to offer the Gospel  to the people and when they did and their  message is rejected it is for them to  cleanse their feet and testify of the   fact to their Father in heaven, and woe  unto those who repudiate the glad  tidings of salvation and their bearers.  The speaker had several times seen  the blood of the martyrs shed in this  dispensation, but although the Gospel  message had been carried into nations  afar off, in not one had the life of one  of the Elders been taken except in this  nation. The fact rendered him sor-  rowful for his country. He had no   vengeful feelings in his heart in relation  to those who committed these fearful  deeds; they were in the hands of God.   The Saints should pray that God might  have mercy upon this nation  and upon all people. So far  as the shedding of innocent blood was  concerned there is no forgiveness for  that sin in this world nor in the world  to come. While we desire to avert  such schenes as the one we commemo-  rate, if we can consistently, we must  not desert the cause of truth under  any circumstances. 
 President Wilford Woodruff read  from and commented upon the 112th  Section of the Doctrine and Covenants.  Portrayed the inevitable destruction  that would fall upon the world if they  did not turn from the error of their  ways, and seek to God for His grace.   Defined the duties of the Teachers;  said that when the Teachers' came to  our houses it was our duty to call our  families together and to listen to what  they have to say to us. Apostles are  subject to the Teachers in their calling  as much as members. All mem should   be honored in their Priesthood. A   Teacher is a very important position  in the Church and Kingdom of our God.   It is the Bishops' prerogative to act in  a Ward capacity, and see that the lesser  priesthood perform all their duties.   The Presidents of Stakes have exclu-  sive jurisdiction in that capacity. An  Apostle would not interfere with that  or any other calling of the Holy Priest-  hood where men are appointed to pre-  side. The First Presidency and the   Quorum of the Twelve Apostles would  not infringe upon or ignore any office  in the Church. Apostle Franklin D.   Richards and myself were appealed to  in a certain case. This case had come  before the Teachers, and the Teachers  cited the offender to appear before the  Bishops' court, where the case was in-  vestigated. The Bishops' court ren-  dered a decision against the accused,   who appealed it to the High Council,   and that body sustained the decision  of the Bishops' court. The accused  came to us. All that we could do was  to act as Teachers. We listened to the   evidence adduced, and could not, as   Teachers, do anything but advise that   the decision of the Bishops' court be  complied with, and urge the offender to  humble himself and obey. He prom-  ised to do so. President Woodruff ex-  horted all to act in their callings and  honor the authority of God. 
 I would like to fill this  mission if I could see  my way clear but I  cant see no way at the   preasant time to get  the means for I hav  not got the means  of my own. If i am  needed on this mission  & the Lord thinks that   ican do some good  i hop that he will  open som way for  me to respomed to   my call. Pleas consider  my sircumstances  & give me your advise  I leave the mather  all with you Pleas  answer as soon as   possible    Your Brother in  the Gospel    John Thalman    Jacob Gottfredson  First Councler vermillion ward  the Bishop is not at home   at preasant    one question Pleas   is it proper to call  a man from the   bishop rik without  his adives or conusil    This brother's recommendation for  a mission was signed both by  his Bishop & Stake Prest. Seegmiller G. R.    He should be so informed,   and I am in favor of giving him such  time as he may need to get ready    over 
 President Wilford Woodruff address-  ed the congregation. He thought if   any generation needed a Prophet to  guide them with the word of the Lord  it certainly was the present. The Saints  had the privilege of rejoicing in the re-  velations of God, given through his  servants. The Prophet Joseph was   called in his youth and weakness  and was not educated in the  things of men. But through the influ-  ence of the Holy Spirit the Prophet   schooled himself until he was one of   the greatest prophets that ever dwelt   upon the earth. One expression that  Joseph was wont to make was, "My  brethren don't know me." Nor did  the Saints understand the greatness of  his mission, which was to lay the foun-  dation for the work that was designed   by God to accomplish the redemption  of the whole human family. That  great prophet was the instrument in  establishing this work of God upon the  earth for that purpose. But do the  world understand the mission of the  Saints? No. They understood no-  thing of the mission the Lord had as-  signed to us.    There were things which are called  spiritual and others called temporal,  but each spiritual matter meant that  some temporal matter was necessary  for its perfection. The Saints should   be taught by their Teachers as much in   reference to their temporal matters as   in spiritual for they are both connec-  tion. If farmers went into debt for  machinery that was really unnecessary  they should be taught they were not  in the line of their duty. All   Israel should learn to take care of   the property the Lord had placed in  their charge. The Saints should pay  more attention to their temporal af-  fairs, and use wisdom as to what crops  to use and how to raise them. Zion   must be built up. The people should  not go into debt, but endeavor to pro-  duce what they consume and consume   what they produce, instead of sending   for goods from afar. Reformation was  necessary in these things, for Zion had  to be built up upon the labor and cap-  ital of the Saints. The judgments of   God which the Lord had decreed  should begin in His house, were about  to be poured out upon all the   nations of the earth. God  held the Saints responsible  for the proclamation of the Gospel and   the establishment of the Kingdom of  God, both in a temporal and spiritual  point of view. The manifestation of   the power of God in bringing these  people from all nations to settle up  these mountain regions was a mighty  event in the history of the world.   President Woodruff spoke in an inter-  esting manner on incidents connected  with the inspiration that characterized   the ministry of the Prophet Joseph   Smith. The Lord had never made   such great promises to any people   as he had to the Saints. None of   the people should fear, for the strife  was not between the world and them   but between God and the evil one. We  need not worry ourselves about the  Church and its destiny, but do that  which God commands.

 PRESIDENT WOODRUFF    Said that he looked upon the Relief So-  ciety as a very important organization.   It was organized by the Prophet Joseph   Smith. As an institution it has its rights  All men and all women have their  rights. He looked upon it as proper for  wheat to be preserved. He thought that  it was better when wheat is laid up for  a long time for the Bishop to take that  wheat and give a receipt for it and when  it was demanded it would be on hand  The Relief Society are doing a great  deal of good. He felt to ask God to  bless them. It is a blessing to save  wheat. We have plenty now but it will  not always be so. All the prophecies  which have been made will come to pass.  He took a great deal of pride in all the  institutions of the Saints. The superin-  tendents and teachers of these various  institutions have a mighty work before  them and he felt to ask God to bless  them 
 QUARTERLY CONFERENCE    President Woodruff and a Num-  ber of The Apostles Present.    On Sunday morning at 10 a.m. the tab-  ernacle was well crowded with people.  There were present on the stand, Presi-  dent Woodruff, Lorenzo Snow, F. D.  Richards, Moses Thatcher, Geo. O . Pit-  kin, M. W. Merrill, Orson Smith, Lorin  Farr, a number of high councilors and  bishops.    The choir sang and James A. Leish-  man offered prayer. They choir sang  "Lo the Mighty God Appearing."    PRESIDENT WOODRUFF  said after an absence of some five years  he had again the privilege of meeting  with some friends in Logan. It has been   about that [5 illegible words]  traveling [4 illegible words]  people. There is no land either an-  cient or modern times who has had  the power to preach the gospel save by  the inspiration of the Holy Ghost. He  spoke of his address to the children on  Saturday and related his experiences on  coming here about 26 years ago. He   thought that every one of the visiting  brethren on that occasion had passed  away. He named these things to show  what time brings to pass. He felt to   say to the brethren and sisters that the  work of the Lord was just as true and  just as important as of any day in the   history of the Church. The Lord kept  this congregation. He kept Joseph   Smith and the Apostles and others to  come forth in this age to perform a  a work. Any people in the earth in any   age are a blessed people who have re-  ceived the gospel, have received a plan   of salvation by which they can gain an  exaltation in the Kingdom of God. The  Lord called Joseph Smith to come forth   to this generation to stand at the head  and no matter how many presidents  may suceed him Joseph will stand at  the head of this dispensation. We have  received that priesthood which is with  out beginning or end of days. No man  has sought to administer in the ordi-  nances of the gospel without that priest-  hood. This priesthood, does not belong  to any other kingdom but to the Celes-  tial Our influence and power depends  upon keeping within the circle of this  priesthood. When any one thinks or gets  along so far that the Church cannot  get along without him he is  very much mistaken. The  speaker [illegible] upon the import-  ance of honoring the preisthood. Any  man who holds the priesthood has the  power to go forth in the world and do  good. He said that there was no time  in his life when he had greater [need]  in the Lord than when he was a [illegible]  and was using his [illegible]. If any man  will magnify the portion of the priest-  hood which he holds and magnify it  the Lord will bless that man.    We have been driven and persecuted.  We had to go through this experience.  When we came it was a great trial  to many of us. But had we not gathered  here there would be a great deal within  the [illegible] of the Bible which would have  been unfinished. The Lord has greatly  blessed this people. If we will do our  duties as a people blessings will become  [2 illegible words]. Zion will arise and the  glory of God will rest upon her. There   never has been but very few in the his-  tory of the world who have in any age   kept the commandments of God. A  warfare has continually been against  them. A warfare commenced with the  prophet Joseph and has continued from  that day to this. It will continue until  the coming of the Son of Man. We  ought to feel thankful unto the Lord.  We ought to labor to carry out the  principles of the gospel. We ought to   thank the Lord every day that we live.  No man can contemplate the work the  children will have to perform save by  the inspiration of the the Almighty. We  seek for the things of this life, for the   honors of men, for riches, but what  are these things compared with the  riches of etenal life. No Latter-day  Saint should have any fears regarding  the Kingdom of God. The Lord will  carry out his work. I do not expect in  turn a very great while on the earth. I  am not afraid to go into the spirit world.    Since we have been in seclusion there  has been a disposition among our young  men to break away from the priesthood.  The moment you step outside of the  priesthood you withdraw from the protec-  tion of the priesthood and are not in the  Celestial Kingdom of God. I don't want  our young men to do that. Secretly the  enemy goes to our young men and tries   to take them away. All will not be  thrown away. This kingdom will stand.  I know it. The God of Heaven does not   look anywhere else than to the young  men and young women to carry on his  work. There is nothing better on earth  than the Kingdom of God. No people   have better opportunities than are pre-  sented in this kingdom. We want our  young men to be true and faithful. It is  a great blessing to have a good family.  Our enemies—I speak now of the fallen  spirits—there are hundreds and thousands  of them. We have many things before   us. The knowledges of eternal life will  remain with us forever. We have hosts  of them. The organizations of the young   people are strong and powerful. It is  desired every man, woman and child to  take hold of the principles of life and en-  deavor to serve God on earth. In his  early days the speaker felt as though  were lost, but when he found this people  he found his Fathers House. The Lord  showed him things which he had seen  fulfilled. He felt as though he was  willing to go hence when the Lord  wanted to call him. He invoked the  blessings of God upon the people. 
 PRESIDENT WOODRUFF    Read a few verses from the 68 Sec.  of the Doctrine and Covenants. He  felt to read those verses in connec-  tion with Bro. Lyman's remarks  concerning the companion we  should have. The Holy Ghost is  one of the principles of the Godhead  and is a witness of the Father and  the Son. No man who speaks by  the power of the Holy Ghost will  ever teach false doctrine. It is by  this power that the Lord is estab-  lishing this Church. It was by this  power that the Prophet Joseph  Smith organized this Chu[r]ch. Joseph  Smith did the work that he did by  the inspiration of the Lord. Jesus  Christ is our advocate with the  Father. The mission of Jesus has   been upon the earth since the day  of creation. It is by this power  that we live. The Holy Ghost has  been a minister to man on the earth.  The Holy Ghost was with Father  Adam. It has been with the pro  phets of God. Father Adam was  the first on the earth who held the  keys of the presidency. The speaker  stated that at Winter Quarters Presi-  dent Young had a dream that the   Prophet appeared to him and told  him to instruct the people to get  the Holy spirit. No man in this  age or any other has ever had power  to go forth in the name of the Lord  only by the power of the Holy   Ghost. No man can administer in  the ordinances of the gospel with-  out the priesthood of God. The  early prophets and patriarchs held  the priesthood and administered by  it. The Saints are together to-day  in this tabernacle because the priest-  hood was given to Joseph Smith.   Had we labored without this priest-  hood and without the Holy Ghost  the people would have remained at   home in the old lands. The speaker  had never accomplished anything  for the Kingdom of God without  being inspired of God. The Lord  had always chosen the weak things   of the earth to accomplish His pur-  poses. If any elder undertakes to   do anything without the Holy Ghost  it will be a failure. That spirit be-  comes a principle of revelation if we  will only seek to understand it. The  speaker related some of his experi-  ence in England and the way that  he was inspired to perform his mis-  sion. He was in the midst of the  great apostacy in Kirtland. He was  one of the Seventies. It was a sor-  rowful day. Oliver Cowdery told  the prophet that the church would  fall if he left it. Cowdery left the  church but it has grown in a won-  derful manner. The Lord does not  intend that men should take honor  unto themselves. He is going to   establish His Kingdom. The Lord  has abundantly blessed this people.   We all have reason to rejoice in the  Lord because of His blessings. We  can confidently trust in the Lord.  We have our enemies, so did the  Savior. The devil sought to tempt  the Savior. The devil sought to tempt  the Savior but he did not succeed.   We talk about prayer—there was no  man who prayed more earnestly  than did the Savior unto the Father.  We should feel charitable toward  those who are seeking our destruc-  tion. The judgments will come and  they are near at hand. If we could  see what things are coming there  are none of us who would envy our  enemies. Look at the changes that  are taking place. What do they  indicate? The coming of the Son  of Man. Let us be faithful before  the Lord. The gospel has been   preached to prepare the way of the   coming of the Son of Man. The   Lord prepared an element to receive  the gospel and to help build up this  work. The Zion of God is here and  it is organized to stay here. The  Lord will preserve it. The speaker   trusted that we might enjoy the  spirit of the Lord. He was glad  that things were as well with the  people here as they are. He invoked  the blessings of God upon the peo-  ple. 
 PRESIDENT WOODRUFF    Said in the history of this world and the  dealings of God with men it is said that  the last dispensation is the greatest the  Lord has given unto men on the   earth. In the establishment of  the kingdom in this age the God of   heaven knew perfectly well what should  be given the Saints in order to establish  this work. He knew just exactly what  His servant, the Prophet Joseph, would  require to do His work. The Lord and   His Son visited him and the angel of   God visited the young man a score of   times He prepared him for the coming   forth of the record which was to be  united with the stick of Juda and go  forth to the earth to the converting of  the human family. The Lord knew the   sacrifice this people would have to  make. Lucifer knew that if he did not   overthrow this prophet, this priesthood of   God, his power would be taken from   him. Here commenced a warfare in the  beginning of the restoration of the Gos-  pel in this dispensation. The devil  tempted the Prophet after a similar  manner to the way that he tempted the   Savior. There was such power given to  Joseph Smith that he knew perfectly  well that he was called of the Lord.  While his enemies sought to destroy  him by the law he was saved by the law.   The three witnesses who were shown  the truth of the Book of Mormon aposta-  tized and turned against the Prophet,  but they never denied the testimony  that they had borne. Just as quick as  the Church was [four illegible words]  and His work. In the translating of the   Book of Mormon Martin Harris obtained  certain pages and they were lost, but the  Lord aided the Prophet and the enemy   was foiled. After translating the Book   of Mormon, in the order of time the  Lord gave unto Joseph the Priesthood.   He received the Aaronic Priesthood and  after that he received the Melchezedic   Priesthood. He baptized certain ones  and afterwards he organized the Church  with six members. The Lord prepared  a class of men who were moved upon to  search for the church—to seek for the   Prophet and they received the Gospel.  The same power which made war in  heaven began to make war upon  the Saints. There was a wicked   spirit entered into some of the Elders   in Kirtland. It was the darkest day  that he had ever seen in the Church  and he never expected to see such a day  again during his probation on the earth.   All the Apostles but two were somewhat   affected. The two were Brigham Young  and Heber C. Kimball. When the  Prophet returned he spoke in the Tem-  ple and about one half of the quorum of   the Apostles were cut off  The Prophet   was filled with power. When Oliver  Cowdery turned from the Church his   power fell with him. He returned again  into the Church. Martin Harris died in  the Church David Whitmer died out-  side.    In the midst of this serious time the  gospel was taken to England. At this   time the speaker was led to go to the   Fox Islands. He was told by Heber C.   Kimball and president Rigdon to go and  he went, and the history of that mission  is before the people. One blessing that   has been poured upon the Saints during  all these persecutions was the Holy  Ghost. It has been a great comfort unto  them during the persecutions. The   Lord has not forsaken us in the midst of  all these things. The devil did not tri-  umph in putting to death the Savior. He  did not triumph when Joseph Smith and   Hyrum were put to death. That same  prophet with his brother Hyrum will  come again to lead this people into the  Celestial Kingdom of our God. Joseph  Smith holds the keys of the presidency  in this dispensation and will hold it for-  ever and forever.    Now we are in these valleys of the  mountains. We have had a time of   peace to build [illegible]But [two illegible words]  [three illegible words] will not [two illegible words]  to destroy this people. The Lord has  given us this land. When we go and   sell our inheritances we give them into  the hands of the enemy. The speaker  did not believe that this people would be  left to go into the hands of the enemy so  that they will be driven from these  mountains we are a blessed people.  This people are raised up for the purpose   of redeeming their dead and whenever   they endeavor to do this, their  enemies will be on the alert. Many of  the fathers and mothers of the people  were good men and women. They de-  sire a work done for them. The gospel  is being preached to the spirits in prison.   There is a great deal to do on the other   side of the vail. The blessings and  power given unto us are greater than  were ever given to a people in the world.  He encouraged the people not to neglect   their duty. Attend to the ordinances   for the dead. The Saints are to become   Saviors on Mount Zion. All the heaven-  ly hosts are watching over the sons  and daughters of Zion. There is that  power and glory in this work that he be-  lieved that many of this people would   remain true and faithful. He did not  see any reason why they should not. He   knew that there were two powers on the  earth. The power of God has been with   this people.    The Latter-day Saints have had a great   desire for miracles. He had never asked   the Lord for the visitation of an angel.  The speaker related his experience on  meeting the prophet for the first time.  He knew that Joseph Smith was a proph-  et. He related his experience in Lon-  don, England with evil spirits. He and   George A. Smith experienced the power  of these spirits. The Lord sent messen-  gers to them to preserve them. He did  it because it was necessary. The Lord  does not send messengers to answer the  whims of man. The greatest testimony   to the human family is the Holy Ghost.  It is a living testimony and it belongs to  the Latter day Saints. The holy priest-  hood is given unto men to minister unto  the living and the dead. For all  the good that men do they will be  rewarded, but when they talk about  salvation the priesthood is necessa-  ry if men make advancement it   will be by the power of the priesthood.  The Devil is laboring for our destruction  and he will try and divide us. He don't  care how it is done. He will try to sep-  erate husband and wife. But husbands  should be kind to their wives and wives  to their husbands, and parents to their   children. God loves us, he loves all of us  and that principle should be with us. The   speaker was glad to meet with the peo-  ple. Let us try to keep the Lord with   us that we may be prepared to sit  down at the great marriage supper of  the Lamb. The choir sang and Apostle  Franklin D. Richards offered prayer and   Conference adjourned for three months. 
 PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF    Did not feel that he would be justified  in finding fault with the farmers for not  attending the meetings here to day. We  should, however, remember the Sabbath  day, to keep it holy. I believe the Lat-  ter-day Saints are a good people, prob-  ably one of the best that ever lived. If  any people were treated as are the Lat-  ter-day Saints, they would rise   against our enemies. But that is not  our plan. We believe in exercising hu-  mility and wisdom and trusting in   the L[or]d. Our p[eop]le es-  pecially, have passed through much  sorrow and suffering during the years of  the past, and a better class of people  never lived. We are under responsibility  to take an interest in the Sunday schools  and to endeavor to instill cor-  rect principles in the hearts of  our young people. Our mission-  aries are trained in the various associa-  tions that have been organized, and   they should strive with all their might  to learn the truth of the principles  which they are taught in those associa-  tions. It was a great work undertaken  when the Prophet Joseph organized the  Relief Society in Kirtland and in Nau-  voo, and that organization has accom-  plished a great work and has been of  great assistance to the authorities of the  church. A great many of our apostles  and prophets and brethren are in the   spirit world, and the history of our lives  will soon close. We should labor to  make a good record, that we may with  pleasure meet with those who have  gone to labor in another sphere. The  words of the prophets are before us,   and they will come true, and the prophe-  cies will be fulfilled to the letter. May  the Lord bless the Saints of God that  they may be able to perform the duties  that await them, and meet the trials  that are before them. 
 PRESIDENT WOODRUFF  addressed the congregation. Said  of the 1,1000,000,000 people on  earth today comparatively few hold  the priesthood and are authorized   and called to preach the gospel to   this vast number of people. This  is a great work required at our  hands, and it must be done before  the judgements of God shall come   upon the earth. The Lord has pre-  pared the people for this very pur-  pose. The elders of Zion are choice  spirits who were designed to come  forth in this day to assist in this  great word—Requested all to   think and reflect deeply upon the  conditions which surround us and   strive to live in accordance with  the will of God. 
 PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF    I have a few thoughts to lay before  the Saints, but I cannot do so intelli-  gently unless I receive the benefit of  the inspiration of the spirit of God, as  most everyone who essays to teach  the people. The subject which I wish   to dwell upon is the principle of [[illegible  unity [[illegible said, "If ye are not one  ye are nothing." [##Doctrine and Covenants 38:27##] This is an import-  ant principle to me, and the Lord has  laid thickly upon us, to be united.  The Lord has bestowed the power and  authority upon us to teach the children  of men. These men occupy a position  in which they are compelled to seek  unto the Lord, and have communion  with Him or, they could not carry the  truth to the nations of the earth. The  propehts of old were under that neces-  sity. The prophets of God in all ages  have been compelled to have com-  munion with God. They have been  compelled to be united. The world   may be divided, but the Saints of God  must be united or they cannot prosper.  With all the revelations and blessings  enjoyed by the followers of Moses, they  transgessed and worshipped a   golden calf and were punished  for that wrong doing. [##Exodus 32:1-8##] God answered  the prayer of Joseph Smith when the  Prophet was a boy, and endowed every   male member of the church with the  priesthood. Joseph Smith enjoyed the  Spirit of the Lord day by day, and was  very closely asssociated with Him and  His holy angels. The Lord commanded   Joseph to set apart Twelve Apostles  to do the work of the Lord. These  Apostles were commanded to be united  and to come and go at the bidding of the   Lord. I have been associated with the  Twelve for over fifty years, and I know  we have been compelled to come and go  and leave our temporal affairs to per-  form missions in the nations of the earth.  I have seen that the Council of Apostles  have been united as a general thing.  Some of them have gone astray and  turned from their callings and they are  to-day in the spirit world, without  priesthood and without kingdom. One  of the prophets at one time wanted to  lay before Joseph a system for the  Church to use. He expained the sys-  tem to Joseph and the Prophet said,  "Yes, that is very good. I have but one  fault to find with it and that is that it  is not true."    Brigham Young was faithful to the  Lord, and he was prospered and enjoyed  the Spirit of God. It devolved upon  Brother Taylor and upon myself, to en-  joy that Spirit and to have communion  with God. I am gratified to know that  this is the case. I know that if we are  not united we are not in the line of our  duty. The various qurums should be  united. Our aim is high, and requires  faithful service. We are fulfilling to-  day the prophecies of the prophets of   old. The eyes of God and the heavenly  host have not been withdrawn but they  are watching us with the deepest inter-  est. Persecution is our legacy, and we   may expect to be opposed and hunted   down by our enemies.    Brethren and sisters, there is room   for improvement here in Zion. The  priesthood here should know that it is  their duty to exercise faith and to put  away their sins. I say if you exer-  cise faith in prayer before God, you  will receive His spirit. Do not be   discouraged. God is with you, and  holds your destinies in his hands. The  church is all right, no matter what  our enemies do. But we muse be hum-  ble and prayerful. I have seen the  time, my brethren and sisters, when I   have been abroad performing mission-  ary work, when I would have given  everything on earth to grasp the hand  of a Mormon Elder. These other  brethren here, Brothers Cannon and  Snow, have doubtless passed through a   similar experience. They have per-  formed missions throughout the earth  and God will reward them.    We should not, my brethren and sis-  [[illegible line  world, for they are dangerous to us the  Latter-day Saints. These things will  take us away from our faith.    Let us honor our callings; let us  honor our priesthood, let us honor our   brethren and those placed in authority  over us, that the blessings of heaven  may rest upon us.    The choir sang, and the benediction  was pronounced by Elder O. N. Liljen-  quist, of Hyrum. 
 PRESIDENT WOODRUFF.    was well pleased to again mingle  with the Cache Valley Saints in  conference assembled. Had been  much edified by the remarks made  in the morning; the subjects treated   were of much importance to the   Saints.    Referred to the wickedness of all  kinds that is filling all the world.   The evil one is doing everything in  power to engulf the children of   men. The voice of the servants of  God has been sounded in these   days to all the world where the  conditions and laws would permit.   In all dispensations of the gospel  the devil has tried to overcome the   servants of God. We should all  labor and guard against the at-  tacks and temptations which the   adversary made upon us, and by   resisting them we would gain  strength over the evil one. Re-  ferred to the early days of the  church and the opposition the  prophet Joseph and his associates  received from the people in their  day. Spoke of the judgments of   God which should come upon the  children of men in consequence of  their refusal to accept the gospel of  Christ. Spoke of the visit of the  First Presidency to Chicago and   Jackson county with the Tabern-  acle choir, and gave an account of  the kind receptions they met with  on that trip, which showed that a   change had come over the nation.   Exhorted the Saints to faithful-  ness in keeping the commandments   of God.

I have always been  accustomed to do so, without objection before.  It is a very hard matter for me to  make a living, under the present circum-  stances, and it would entirely prevent   my doing so, if I have to remove them.  If you wish me to do so, I will instantly  comply, but I pray you to grant me  permission to continue doing as I   am, and thus prevent my becoming  dependant entirely on public charity  for a living    Your brother in the Gospel  John.

First when the   Elders administer to the sick some  times I have herd them say that they  shall recover, then the^y^ die do they have   the spirit of their calling when this acurs?  When a Brother or sister Dies is the   angles or ther good spirits at their bedside  waiting for them.  Why is it that some  are called leaving wife children or   husband Sometimes in poor circumstances  Is their a work on the other side of the  vail for us to do?  Do the spirits of eny  ever come back to commune with their  Family ever?  your advice is to seek  the Spirit of God.  Do you value the Spirit  of the Lord above eny earthly value,   or ^eny^ ammount of money?    Dear Brother I would be pleased to

 ELDER WILFORD WOODRUFF    Said he had felt, for a long time, the  need of a change in Zion. He believed  the time had come when we must pre-  pare for greater usefulness in the king-  dom of God. He knew it would take  more to prepare the people for union in  temporal things, than it had in spiritual  things. There must be a unity of pur-  pose in faith, spirit, labor and every-  thing, before we shall be prepared to   meet the Zion of God which is to come  down from heaven. He believed the   whole world was getting ripe for the  harvest, and a great change must take  place among the Saints, that they might   be able to do the work assigned them.   The question arises, are the blessings  promised in the gospel, of more worth  than the property which we are made   stewards over? Was it going to take   away anything we possess if we conse-  crate it all to God? No. It would add  to it. But we must beware of pride lest  we become like the Nephites of old. We  must stop bringing in from the East and   West things we could produce for our-  selves. This was a suicidal policy. Let  the Lord rule and we obey; and it we  enter into the order of union, there was  no fear that we should be deprived of  anything we need. He had no doubt   Prest. Young had introduced this order  just as soon as the hearts of the people  were prepared for it; and went on to  show how the principles of the gospel  had been revealed, gradually, as fast as  the people were prepared to receive   them. This order would prevail and the   spirit of it would flow like the waves of  the sea, till it reached every settlement.   The spirit of God would bear record of  the truth of it. Babylon was bound to  fail, and if we stay as we are, depending  on Babylon for necessaries, we would  have to go without. In this Order, he  meant to be ready to go and come just   as he was required, and he considered   this the duty of every member of it.   The Relief Society could do a great deal  more than they had done, organizing   themselves for the production of things  they and their families need. If this is  the Zion of God, he would say let us   unite to build it up in the way the Lord  had appointed. 
 Nov. 19, 1897 The Lord being my  helper. I hope the Lord will  overrule every thing for my  good which I know He will  if I faithfully serve Him and   keep His commandments.    Ever praying for the cause of  truth I remain your brother  in the Gospel    Lewis Swensen    J W Irons 
 I hope and pray that I may  be humble and prarerful and  be able to bear testimony of  the Lords great work in these  last days, to His names honer and  glory. I will close by asking  the Lords blessings upon You and  all the Holy Priesthood, and those  that desire to serve the Lord.    I remain your brother  in the gospel,    Lewis Swensen. 
 PREST. W. WOODRUFF  heartily endorsed all the remarks  made before. He was gratified that  the Latter-day Saints did not enjoy  the fellowship of the ungodly and  wicked of this generation. This is  the last dispensation of the fulness   of times; the devil doesn't like it,  but the speaker does not blame him.  The little handful on April 6, 1830,  has increased to 150,000. Four tem-  ples are being erected, wherein to  redeem the dead. No wonder the   devil fights this work, for he realizes  that his day is at the door.    The wicked don't like us. Neither   does the devil. He never did like  the work of light and truth. There  is universal warfare between Heaven  and hell, light and darkness, truth  and error.    We are here, dwelling in the  flesh, destined to accomplish the  purposes of the Lord, and well may   we be steadfast and truthful in the   cause.    Speaking to the young people,  Prest. Woodruff showed how the   revelations of old had been and are  being fulfilled in these latter days.  Considering the future of the rising  generation, Elder Woodruff empha-  sized the greatness of the work they  are engaged in, in this the greatest  dispensation of all ages, for which  thousands of spirits were reserved   for thousands of years.    Looking back on the past years,   when the Twelve had to go forth,  preaching the everlasting Gospel to   the unbelievers and scoffers, he re-  membered how many times he asked  the question: "Where are the sons  of the prophets?" But now, look-  ing on the rising generation, he was  satisfied that the work would not  lack in staunch expounders and de-  fenders. The speaker here gave a  vivid sketch of the corruption and   abomination of the world, from  which emanate so many would-be  "purifiers" of Utah.    We trust in God. We will obey  His will, dying or living; for we are   not doing our will but His.    Prest. Woodruff concluded with   exhorting the young men to con-  tinue firm in the faith of their fath-  ers, persevering in the pursuit of  knowledge and the practice of all  pure principles. Great are the   judgements which are impending   over the world in their wickedness.  For God has decreed His work in  these last days, and though  earth and hell combine they will not  prevail. Great will also be the pow-  ers with which the young genera-  tion will be clothed in the days of  probation. Prest. Woodruff also   admonished the young men to mar-  ry, and if they marry to do so in the  right way.    The young men are looked to by  the Presideny as the rising glory  of Zion, to carry off the great work  the foundations of which were laid  by the Prophet Joseph. 
 Lorenzo F. Hatch  May 22 [18]97. 
 Apostle Wilford Woodruff said:  The Lord has had a motive in or-  ganizing these associations, in in-  spiring men to encourage, counsel,  dictate and direct in these institu-  tions; from them have got to come   forth men and women who will be  instruments of the God of Israel, in   carrying out the work which their  parents have commenced.    As to the manner of conducting   these Associations I cannot lay down  any definite rules that will perhaps   apply to everybody alike, and as far  as I am concerned, I feel a good deal  like letting everybody have their   own free agency and do as they  please, as long they do good. If you  wish to have the Associations male  and female, all right, but if you  think more good can be accomplish-  ed by having the sexes meet separ-  ately, why, all right; if you will only  magnify your callings as sons and   daughters of the Lord, and prepare  yourselves to step forth and take the  places of your fathers and mothers.    One thing I wish to encourage; I   want our young men to spend the  time as much as possible in treasur-  ing up the words of life. Of course  you want variety, but I would  advise our young men to take the   Bible, Book of Mormon, Doctrine  and Covenants and read; not for the  sake of seeing how many chapters  you can read, but to try how much  you can understand and remember.   There is not a boy in Israel eight  years old who, if he could compre-  hend that he is an heir to the great  blessings promised in these good  books, would feel that he has ten   minutes to spare in reading a novel.   He urged the young men to prepare  themselves to go forth and spread  the Gospel, and labor to benefit one  another. I have said in days gone  bye, Where, O where, O Lord, are  the sons of the prophets who are go-  ing to take this responsibility off of   us? To-day I see before me instru-  ments in the hands of God, where  the spirit and power of God   can operate. I see rising   up before me a generation  who are willing to go forth as their  fathers have done, and my heart re-  joices. Go before the Lord in your   closets, and open your hearts to   Him in faith and he will answer  your prayers. The time will come  when you will require faith to com-  mand the elements, and they will   obey.    Another thing I want to say,  when you wish to take a wife, re-  member she has got to be a com-  panion to you in time and eternity,  and the mother of your children.  I will close by saying, do not   visit grog shops, and other similar  places; keep your bodies and spirits  pure, and use your influence with  others to do the same whenever you  have an opportunity. I would say  the same to my young sisters. We  can afford to stand the injustices put  upon us by the world, as far as the   Lord will permit. 
 PRESIDENT WOODRUFF    bore his testimony to the  words of President Cannon.  The priesthood, he said, was   the same throughout eternity. The  Lord told me to choose for counsellors  the men I have chosen. Of what  good are they unless I consult with  them? When they give counsel they  give what the spirit gives them and   what the spirit has told me and I then  do it. Why are the words of those   named in the revelation, read by  President Cannon, the words of the  Lord? Because they were spoken by  the Holy Ghost, one of the Godhead. 
 PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF    was the first speaker of the afternoon.  He said: It is five years ago since I   spoke to you here and some of my  young brethren are growing old.  Though we who address you may be  of the presidency of the church we  are as dependent on the Lord for his  guidance and assistance as any elder   or any one in the church holding the   priesthood. We all need the spirit of  God. There never was a man, a  prophet or apostle who was not de-  pendent on the spirit of God. I have   promised the Lord that whatever he  gave me I would give to the people.  If he does not give me anything you  will not get much from me.    There are many things concerning  the Latter-day Saints which occupy  my mind. Next April it will be 60   years since the organization of this  church. What a change has come  over the world since then. There was   no one murder committed where  there are now a thousand. Those  who will read the newspapers find that it   will take them two hours to read of  the murders which occur in every  twenty-four hours. All these things are  open to the eyes of the Lord. The an-  gels of God are waiting to go forth  and reap down the earth because of  its wickedness.    What is the destiny of the genera-  tion that ripens in iniquity. The Bi-  ble tells of it. Whenever the nations  turned from the Lord of Heaven and   worshipped Baal they were chastised  and the judgements of God overtook  them. All the ancient cities, Tyre,   Thebes, Babylon, Jerusalem and  others were in their time destroyed  because of their wickedness and that  programme has been carried on to  the present day and will be to the  coming of the Son of Man. It is in-  teresting to read the revelations and  prophecies to read the revelations and   prophecies in the Bible and Book of  Mormon which tell of the future gen-  erations.    Fifty-six years of my life I have   spent in the church and over fifty  years in the apostleship. A whole   quorum of apostles have been taken  to the spirit world and another or-  dained since we reached these val-  leys. I am the only apostle living of   those who came into these valleys as  apostles. I am the only man living  who received his endowments under  the hands of Joseph Smith.    The Lord has set his hand to carry  out the ancient prophecies and he  will do it. He called Joseph Smith  and others to the work and gave  them the priesthood. This seems  blasphemy to many, to talk of the  priesthood, but I defy any man in the   Christian churches to show that God  ever had a people whom He acknowl-  edged as His people but that He gave  them the powers of the priesthood.  The Lord could not set His hand to   gather His people and to fill this dis-  pensation except by the priesthood.  It is by the power of God that you  have been gathered from all nations  to this land.    I wish to say a few things to the   Latter-day Saints with regard to  your position with the Lord and the  gospel you have received I know   this is a work of truth, that God is true,  that Jesus Christ is true, that the  prophecies and revelations are true.  As the God has set His hand to per-  form this work during the past sixty  years will He now stop? No. He   will continue and as prophecies have   been fulfilled so will every word that   has been written. When the work  first began we could go into   every city and baptize hundreds.  I have traveled during my time 150,-  000 miles while preaching the gospel  and in every town and village I or-  ganized branches and so did my   brethren. Now our sons go out and  baptize five and six and think they   have done a good work. And they   have, for the vintage is over. The  Gentiles reject the gospel. It is as  much as a man's life is worth to preach  to-day where in early days we baptized  our thousands The Gentiles reject the   truth as did the Jews In the primi-  tive days all who taught the gospel  were destroyed. The Jews fell into  darkness and in the fulfillment of the  prophecies their city was destroyed  and they have now for 1800 years  been captives among the Gen-  tiles a hiss and a by word. The yoke  is yet on Judah, but it is to be broken  and they will gather home and meet  their Shiloh. In these last days the  gospel has come to the Gentiles and  will afterwards go to the Jews. When  Christ came the Jews received it   first, rejected it and it went last to  the Gentiles. Thus the prophecies  are being fulfilled that the first shall  be last and the last shall be first. To-  day hell and wicked men exert all  their power against the church carry-  ing on a fearful warfare The Chris-  tians tell us that apostles and prophets  and revelations were necessary only  in the dark ages, but the Lord  does not say so. He has revealed His  mind and will to this people.    I will ask you a few questions. You  have seen the gathering of the people.  You have seen the history of the  church Do you find anything in  these valleys to try you? You have  the water trouble and have a dry  season. If there is an elder in Israel  who will yield to temptation and be-  cause of a dry season will go to law  against his brethren let him thus be   tempted. He may as well be  tempted over the water question as  any other. I do not expect one half  of those I have baptized to be saved  for they will apostatize before   they reach the kingdom of God. If  we suffer any affliction it will be be-  cause of our own actions. What the  Lord has said will come to pass. Zion  will be redeemed. If she sin the  Lord will chastise her but she  will be redeemed. If we sin that sin  costs much more than it is worth. The  water question causes the people to  divide, go to law, and injure each  other My counselors have felt that   if they go to law without arbitration  they should be disfellowshipped, and I  feel the same way. It is not setting a  good example if we quarrel one with  another. I would rather have every-  thing green on my place dry up than  go to law against my brethren. I have   a long eternity with them on the other  side of the veil. What, quarrel with   them while here for a few days! No,  I wish not to be responsible for it. Let  us not go to war with our neighbors,  or ourselves. The Lord will judge for   us. He says "judgment is mine."  There is no more escape from the   judgments of God now than in ages  past.    Every man and woman who has  made sacred covenants, go to the  Lord and make your wants known.  Let the prayers of 100,000 Saints arise  to God and I tell you they will be  answered. You are His people, His   sons and daughters. Make your wants  known and He will bless you. I have  no fear concerning Zion. She will be  redeemed. All the fear I have is the  follies we commit ourselves; from them   we will suffer. Watch the signs of the   times; the pouring out of the plagues;  the judgments will come and  they will come as sure as  there is a heaven and earth. I have  felt to speak of these things for I will  not stay here long. I am going beyond  the veil to perform another work. Be  faithful, watch and pray. Do not  neglect your prayers; let all quarrels  and divisions among your pass away.    Young men attend to your duties   and prepare to bear off the kingdom  while your fathers go beyond the veil.  May God open your hears, your ears  and eyes and fill you with wisdom;  live your religion and you will be   blessed. 
 President Wilford Woodruff addressed  the congregation and spoke substatially  as follows:    For quite a number of months any   brain work has been so severe, that I   have felt it right to throw off some of  this work of speaking on my brethren  of the Twelve who are with me, I have   been edified and interested. This testi-  mony is applicable. What has been  said in regard to the absense of Saints   from these meetings does not apply to  those who are here.    Our last conference here was crowded.   The tabernacle in the various stakes,   during conferences, are generally well  filled. The Lord has not gone asleep,  He has not gone upon a journey, He has  not deserted his cause. The Lord has  decreed from the foundation of the world  the dispensation of all his dealings with  men, all these depensations have been  foreseen by the Prophets. We are ful-  filling the prophecies in regard to this  work, there is no greater work than the  work in which we are engaged. The  church has been organized for 50 years,   and there is no reason why we should   lose interest in the work. We came  here because the Lord was prepared to  perform a work. The 200,000 souls now  in the church were kepi in the spirit  world for six thousand years, to come  forth in this dispensation. What time  have we to spend foolishly? We have  none, it will be a loss to us when here,  and hereafter.    Read the history of the world suicide  and sickness, death and desolation are  beginning to feel after the nations of the   earth, These things will increase after  the testimony of the elders has been re-  jected, it is our duty to testify to all na-  tions, after our testimonies come these  testimonies of destruction. Those  words have been spoken and will be ful-  filled. We will be held on accountabil-  ity for our works. The priesthood is given  to us and we are held responsible for  this work to the extent of our positions  and callings. If I fail to do my duty  I shall be held responsible and   so with the Twelve and every member   of the church. We should wake up and   realize our condition and responsibilities  and labor to save the souls of men and   perform all duties devolving upon us  Our reward will be commemorated  with the course we pursue in the flesh.    The hand of God is in all matter tem-  peral and spiritual. He will control all  things for our good if wee serve Him.   Our political experience will be a bles-  [i]ng to us. No man need be discouraged or  disappointed. The Lord holds the des-  tiny of all people in His hands, when  we come to the end of our lives we will  [s]ee this more clearly. We have receiv-  ed great blessings and great promises  and should commit no sin. The Lord wil  sustain us if we do right. Our young  people should attend the various instu-  tions in the church organized for their  benefit, and become acquainted with  the principles of the gospel, and be pre-  pared to withstand temptations. It is  sad to see our sons lead astray by evil   influences. The powers of evil are bring  ing to bear all their efforts, and all the  influences that can be brought to bear  us astray. The Savior was tempted 40  days; if He had yielded, the Devil would  have achieved a great victory, but he  did not. He gave us an example to fol-  low. He prayed to the Father--Pray,  pray always, there is where our help  lies, even in temporal affairs, we should   go before God. He will answer our   prayers, and we will have power to over  come all evil. No man can lead as-  tray the people, and if a president  should attempt it he would be removed.  The authorities are sustained by the  people's prayers and therein lies our  strength. Men have apostized from  time to time. In Kirtland one half of the  Quorum of the Twelve apostatized and   went against the prophet, but the Lord  sustained him and he filled the position  to which he had been called, till the  Lord took him away. He performed his  work, and will hold the keys of the grea[t]  dispensation in the morning of the re-  surrection. What is there to pay a man  to sin or do wrong. There is nothing to  justify a man in doing evil, nothing to  make a man happy in disobeying the  commandments of God. Let us remem-  ber the covenants we have made with   the Lord. We should remember the  councils we receive from time to time,  and train our children in the ways of   the Lord; it is a great comfort and con-  solation when our sons walk in the ways  of righteousness and do not follow in   the paths of evil.    This is the gospel of Christ and the  work will stand in spite of all obstacles,  and the saints will remain here till  Christ comes and will not be driven   from their homes again. The speaker  remembered when he was 20 years of  age a murder was committed in Con-  necticut. That circumstance convulsed   all New England. Today murders and   suicides are a common occurance. Let  us labor to get the children to attend  Sabbath schools and meetings that they  may become acquainted with the will of   God. He had often said when a boy  and attended Sabbath school, that he   would esteem it a blessing above all  blessings to live in a time when apostles  and prophets were upon the earth as in   the days of the Savior, and had asked   why the churches did not enjoy the  gifts and blessings given to the early  saints. He had been answered, they  were not needed now as we live in the  light and blaze of the gospel. Now we  are blessed with the same blesings and   ordinances as were the former day saints  He hoped to live many years with the  people of God and enjoy the blessings  of the gospel as he had done for the  last 60 years. He knew the gospel was  true, he had received this testimony  from the first sermon he ever heard. We  have a high destiny before us, and  should live pure and temperate lives in  order to be worthy. Prayed God to bless  the people with strength to do right and   keep his commandments. 
 President Woodruff addressed the  congregation. He had not intended to  speak, but the remarks of President  Smith had laid upon him a duty to per-  form. It was his duty to bear a testi-  mony to their truth. There were many  in the congregation who had been  members of the church for from 30 to   50 years and they knew for themselves,  that what Brother Joseph F. Smith had  said, was true. The God of Heaven had  commanded the Latter-day-Saints to be  united, and they were the only people   whom he had so commanded. Why?  Because they were the only people who  had the gospel.    In relation to the present position  the speaker stated that he was not  responsible because God had called  him for a short time to preside over  the church. As great a man as was   Joseph Smith, he had seen men stand-  ing in the temple of God, curse him to  his face. What had been the result?  Why these men died miserably and   went to hell. Again, God was responsi-  ble for having placed him where he  was; and he was responsible for plac-  ing his counselors with him. 
 PRESIDENT WOODRUFF  arose to address the saints. He ex-  plained that he had invited Mother  Thomas to the stand that she might  hear the speakers. He had baptized  her over fifty years ago in Tennessee  and eaten many meals at her table  when a missionary. Speaker then re-  lated his early training; how under  Presbyterian training he had learned  whole chapters of the Bible, and he be-  came convinced that the same gospel  was not taught today as in former days,  at least not in the New England states   where he went to hear all the preachers  who came into that neighborhood. He  had prayed that the true gospel as of  old might be given him, and he be-  lieved that gospel would come to him.   He testified that he had received that   same doctrine. The speaker rejoiced   that he had lived so long as he had,  and had seen so many of the prophesies  fulfilled. For eighteen hundred years  the world had been without the gospel  and now it has again been restored, and   we are called upon to perform a great  work. There are prabably a hundred  fallen angels to each living soul, trying   to tempt us and turn us from the paths of  righteousness. Those same spirit took our  Savior out in the wilderness and tempt-  ed Him, and Satan offered Him every-  thing if but Christ would worship the   evil one. Those same influences still  exist, but the power of darkness cannot  now overcome the church of God.   Joseph Smith will occupy the same  position as to this dispersation that  Jesus Christ occupied to the former  church. They will both come forth  clothed with glory and immortality.   This people is the one that must spread  the gospel, and prepare the way for the  coming of the Savior. If the young   men could only realize the importance   of their position there is not one who  could be hired to smoke a cigarette or  mingle with the drunken. Our acts  are well recorded above and we will be  judged according to how we use the  power given us. Neither would any  maiden turn from the path of virtue, if  she realized her position in the eyes of  heaven. The speaker was pleased to  see the zeal of the leading officers of   our various organizations for improve-  ment. The last days are upon us, as   noted by the many crimes and death  by natural elements which are upon us.   There is no time to lose, therefore, and   we should all strive for knowledge and   perfection. God bless our societies  that are organized for our advance-  ment. Whoever goes to the saloons  and other evil places will be sorry for  it. Our young men should not allow  the devil to tempt them; say no when  he tempts you. 
 President Woodruff believed he knew  Brother Smoot as well as any man  living. The Gospel had gathered as  great men as ever lived, and Brother  Smoot was one of them. President   Woodruff then spoke to detail of his  early acquaintance with Brother  Smoot, when they traveled together in  the missionary field in Tennessee and  Kentucky. They had gone together  to Kirtland and the Prophet Joseph  had become acquainted with Brother  Smoot. At one time in Kirtland only  two of the quorum of Apostles stood  by the Prophet; the others, who   were dis[a]ffected, called upon the  speaker and Brother Smoot to  join them in opposing the Prophet,  but it had no effect upon them  bec[a]u[s]e they knew that Joseph was a   Prophet of God, and they warned  those Apostles that if they [w]old not  repent they would go to perdition.  Brother Smoot had power given him  to guide and control; he walked   straight forward in the path of duty,  from which he never wavered. He   was an affectionate man to his family   and friends, and it was impossible to   keep from sorrowing to an extent at  his departure, but the speaker did not  [f]eel to mourn at the death of any  Latter-day Saint. He felt to thank  God for such a man as President Smoot;  it would not be a great time before  the grave will give up its dead  and Brother Smoot will stand at the  head of his family organization. Presi-  dent Woodruff was glad to be able to  attend the funeral, and had a great de-  sire to have visited Brother Smoot be-  fore his death but was unable to do so.
