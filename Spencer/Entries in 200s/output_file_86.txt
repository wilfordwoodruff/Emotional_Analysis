Q. Cannon ENDENTRY  The First Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints           Apostles, held on Thursday, October 31st, 1895, the following decisions  were reached, and are now presented for the guidance of Presidents of  Stakes, Bishops, and their associate officers, and all whom they may  concern:   of Zion, of High Priest, Seventies, Elders and Priests, who may have  been called to act in the capacity of Teachers, having an organization  distinct from that of the Teachers' Quorum and being presided over by a  president and two counselors.  The tendency of such organizations has  been to assume functions belonging to the legitimate councils or  quorums of the priesthood. The question submitted, was, Is it proper for  such organizations to exist, or to be presided over in this manner? The  Council felt that it was not proper, as no provision is made for them  in any of the revelations of the Lord relating to church government;   neither is there any necessity for them. And the Council decided that  the brethren who bear the Melchizedek Priesthood, acting as Teachers,  should not have a separate president and counselors, but that they  should, when acting in this capacity, be presided over directly by the  Bishopric, whose aids they are in all things connected with the well- being of the ward.  ENDENTRY  should persons guilty of unchastity be required to make confession –- at the general meeting of the members of the ward, at the fast meeting,  or the monthly priesthood meeting? It was the mind of the Council that  the regulations of confessions in such cases should be left to the  Bishopric of the ward in which the wrong-doing occurs; and that each  case be considered on its merits, and disposed of according to the pub- licity which has been given to it. For instance, wh of adultery or fornication confess their sin, and their transgression  is known only to themselves, the confession should not be made public.  But where publicity has been given to it, the confession should be made  before the priesthood of the ward at the regular monthly priesthood  meeting; or, if it be deemed advisable by the Bishopric that a stll more  public confession should be made, it shall mean that the confession  shall be made at the monthly fast meeting (which meetings are attended  almost, if not, exclusively by church members) and that in no case shall  confessions be made at the regular Sunday services.   as much as possible to the circ to avoid spreading the knowledge of sin, according to the revelation,  which says (Doc. &amp; Cov. Sec. 42, 89) that such things "shall be done in  a meeting, and that not before the world."   a few, the confession (if required to be made at all) should be made at  the priesthood meeting, and only in such cases where the offence has  become a public scandal and reproach to the church should the more  public confession be required.

Well then if that cannot be done I want you to have me sealed to your son Mohonri M Steele (he was then there on  a mission) and my Children adopted to him and me and left the matter in my hands to see to it She died shortly after I left England and I have had her Endow- ments attended to for her but nothing more Now dear Brother your answer to this question would settle the matter and by so doing would would greatly oblidge your Brother in the Gospel   ENDENTRY        came duly to hand, and in response will say that I am ready now any time to start for my Mission to the North W.

As the business you appears to prove profitable no doubt but you will do well to persevere in it And I would heartily except of your generous offer in joining you in canvassing two or three of these western counties if circumstances would permit but I stand in need of more information respecting the subject before I can decide. You know Brother it is expensive travling 5 or 6 months without any incomes &amp; now I would like to know who your employers are &amp; whether they reside in Connecticut &amp; how long we must wait for our pay.

There is business sufficient for three of us at holm the coming season but perhaps not to that profit that it would be for me to go into the Book business. We have some payments coming due in the spring which probably will take what money we shall have. If I could procure a little money if it was not more than $20.00 I think I would take a  which is fast hastening.

We are  under the necessity of making use of  our pen, to give you an account of our  labors in the ministry since we left  Kirkland, as we cannot at present speak  to you face to face. We left Kirtland  May 31st, and took Steamboat at Fair- port in company with Elder Milton  Holmes, to go forth to labor in the  vineyard as the Lord should direct. After calling on the Saints in Jefferson  Co. N. Y. we arrived at Sackett's  Harbour and took Steamboat on the 6th of June for Upper Canada and on the 8th arived at Brother Artemus  Judd's. And on the 10th, had the hap- py privilege of setting in conference  with James Blakes- lee, and a number other elders, and a  large congregation of Saints. And  we were blessed with a very interesting  time. After spending several days  with them we took the parting hand  with these beloved friends and pro- ceeded on our journey for the East in  company with elder John Goodson, and  others bound for England. We took  the parting hand with them at Schenec- tady, and arrived at the Canaan church  in Connecticut, visited the church a  few days. Here elder M. Holmes  took his departure for Mass. and we  went to Colebrook, visited different parts  of the town and held eight meetings,  from thence to Canton and held a meet- ing in the village hall in Collinsville. As we commenced speaking several began to beat their drums at the doors  which made much confusion. This is  the only disturbance we have had since  we left Kirtland. We next visited  Avon, where we held four meetings  and many came out to hear and mani- fest a spirit of inquiry. And elder  Woodruff had the privilege of leading  three of his kinfolk into the waters of  baptism. And had not the Spirit call- ed us away to perform a greater work,  we should have had no difficulty in es- tablishing a branch of the church in  that place. A family where we tarried  but one night, and taught them the  things of the kingdom, believed our tes- timony, and after our departure, two  of the household followed us 15 miles  to receive baptism at our hands, but we  were gone, and they truly believed it  to be a day of warning and not of ma- ny words. We also visited Farming- ton and held one meeting in the Meth- odist meeting house, and preached to  an attentive congregation who wished  to hear more concerning the great work  of God. We left Farmington on the 20  of July, for Mass. and after visiting  the Bradford church, and after preach- ing several times with them, we pro- ceeded on our journey to Saco, Maine,  where we spent several days with the  church and friends. But duty urging  us forward to lift the warning voice to  those that had not heard the sound of  the gospel, we then went to the city of  Portland. We there took the Steam- er Bangor on the 19 of August, to speed  us on our way to the Islands of the sea,  they landed us at Owls head at the set- ting of the sun: But how to get con- veyance to the Islands we knew not,  we retired to a grove and offered up  our thanks unto God for his mercies  and asked him to open our way before  us; we returned to the Inn and soon  found some men that were going near  the Islands that night, they said they  would land us if we chose to take pas- sage with them. We accordingly went  on board, they hoisted sail and landed  us on North Fox Island, Vinalhaven,  at 2 o'clock Sunday morning, August  20th. It was with peculiar feelings  and sensations that we began to walk  forth upon one of the Islands of the sea  which was wrapped in the sable shades  of night, whose waters, had never cov- ered a soul for the remission of their  sins after the order of the gospel, and  which soil had never been press- ed by the foot steps of an elder of Is- rael. We were strangers, pilgrims,  and almost pennyless. But we had ENDENTRY  ed him faithful that had promised, and  we felt willing to trust in his name,  we soon came to a house, where we  were received and we retired to rest.  We arose in the morning made ourselves  known as servants of the Lord, we in- quired if there was any religion or  priests on the Island; we were inform- ed that there was a Baptist priest, a  small church and a meeting house at  the center of the Island. The town of  Vinalhaven includes both North and  South Fox Islands: Pop. 1800. The  inhabitants are generally wealthy, in- telligent, industrious, generous and  hospitable to strangers. North Island  is 9 miles long, and 2 wide, pop. 800.  South Island is 10 miles long, and 5  wide, pop. 1000 &amp;c. As it was Sab- bath morning there was to be preach- ing in the meeting house, we conclu- ded to attend considering it a proper  place to introduce the gospel. When  we arived at the place, meeting had  commenced, the deacon came to the  door and we informed him that we  were servants of the Lord, that we had  a message for the people and wished  to be heard, the deacon informed the  priest that we were preachers of the  gospel. He invited us into the stand  and gave out an appointment for us at 5 o’clock P.M. After the priest had  closed his discourse he invited us to his  house during the intermission. We  presented him the book of Mormon,  he appeared friendly and said he should  like to read it. We met according to  appointment and preached to them the  first principles of the gospel. We then  gave out appointments for the four fol- lowing evenings to be held at the sev- eral school houses on the Island. The  people came out in great numbers and  heard with attention and manifested  much anxiety, and in fourteen days  we held nineteen meetings. The Bap- tist priest became alarmed seeing that  his craft was in danger; and fearing  that if he held his peace all Fox Islands  would believe on our words, accor- dingly he strove to use his influence  against us, but without effect as you  may judge on learning the fact that on  Sunday the 27th while we met with a  congregation, he had not so much as  one to meet with him at his usual place of worship, for the excitement was so  great that the members of his church  and deacon, were attending our meet- ings and inviting us to visit them, and  inquiring into these things. The Lord  clothed us with his Spirit, and we were  enabled to stand up and boldly declare  those things that are commanded us. And the sound thereof soon reached  the neighboring Islands and some of the  inhabitants soon hoisted their sails to  convey them over the waters to hear  the tidings for themselves. On Sun- day the 3rd of Sept. we preached to a  large congregation assembled together  from these Islands, at the close of our  meeting we opened a door for baptism,  and a respectable sea captain and his  wife offered themselves as candidates,  we then assembled where there was  much water and after offering up our  prayers unto God, we then lead them  down into the sea and baptized them  and we returned rejoicing. On Mon- day following we visited the South Is- land to set before them the truths of the  everlasting gospel. We held five  meetings, the people came out by hun- dreds, to hear and filled the school- houses to overflowing.   people to hear more upon this impor- tant subject, yet we were under the  necessity of returning to the North Is- land, to attend an appointment on Sun- day, accordingly we met and preached  to the people and opened a door for  baptism and another sea Captain and a  young lady came forward and we re- paired to the sea shore and baptized  them, and on Tuesday following, we  administered the ordinance of baptism  unto three others.   land fearing whereunto these things  would grow, came over to the Island  where we were baptizing and made  friends with the Baptist priest (like  Pilate) and called a meet- ing, we attended ##Luke 23:12##. The Methodist priest  arose and commenced warm hostilities  against the book of Mormon, and our  principles, we took minutes of his dis- course that we might be correct in an- swering him. As he could not bring  proof from the word of God against  our principles, and in order to make  an impression upon the minds of his  hearers against the work; he took the  book of Mormon in his hand, and with  an out stretched arm declared that he  feared none of the judgments of God  that would come upon him for rejecting  that book as the word of God. When ENDENTRY  rectified some of his wide mistakes in  his presence before the congregation,  and informed the people if they would  meet next Sabbath at the meeting  house we would answer every ebjection  that had been presented against the  book of Mormon and our principles du- ring the meeting. And last Sabbath  we met a congregation of several hun- dred at the meeting house, assembled  together from the different Islands, and  we arose in their midst, and redeemed  our pledge by answering every objec- tion that had been brought against the  book of Mormon, or our principles. After meeting we repaired to the water  and again administered the ordinance  of baptism. The Baptist priest is no  less busy than his Methodist brother, for  while one is in the pulpit declaring to  the people, that the principles of the  book of Mormon are saping the very  foundation of our churches and holy  religion; the other is gone over to the  main land calling upon his Baptist  brethren, saying come over and help  us lest we fall. But cursed is man  that trusteth in man or maketh flesh his  arm saith the Lord God. O ye priests  of Baal your cry is in vain, the God of  Israel has set his hand the second time  to recover his people. The stone has  began to roll, and will soon become a  mountain and fill the whole earth. The  Lord is calling his church out of the  wilderness, with her gifts and graces  and restoring her judges as at the first.  God has chosen the weak things of  this world to confound the wise, and  with them he will rend your kingdoms,  that the wisdom of your wise men may  perish, and the understanding of yonr  prudent men may be hid. The cry of  the Saints is ascending into the ears of  the Lord of Sabaoth for Ephraim. The horns of Joseph are begining to  push the people together. The apos- tles of the Lamb of God are bearing the  keys of his kingdom on the shores of  Europe. Yea and the mighty Captains  of the ships at sea, are receiving the  gospel of Jesus Christ; and enjoying  its power, and the call of many from  distant Islands, has already entered  our ears; O come and preach to us,  we have sent a book of Mormon over  the billows of the great deep, to teach  those that are at sea. And the word  and work are propelled by the arm of  JEHOVAH. And the weapon that is  formed against Zion shall soon be  broken. And he that raises his puny  arm against it, is fighting against God  and shall soon mourn because of his  loss. We say these things are true as  God liveth, and the Spirit beareth rec- ord and the record is true, and ven- geance will be speedily executed upon  an evil work in these last days, there- fore, O Babylon thy fall is sure.   few on these Islands, yet there is hun- dreds believing and many are almost  ready to enter into the kingdom, the  calls are numerous from the neighbor- ing Islands, and also from the main  land, for us to come and preach unto  them, and tell them words whereby  they may be saved from the pending  judgments that await the world. There  are fifteen or twenty neighboring Islands  that are inhabited, some of them con- tain a population of several thousand.  And while the fields are white, we  view the harvest great in this country:  and the laborers few. And while we  are faithfully laboring day and night  for the salvation of his people; we ask  an interest in your prayers, O ye  Saints of the most high God. O ye  elders of Israel will ye not go forth in- to the vineyard and help wind up the  scene of this generation which sits in  darkness and in the shadow of death.   O ye ministers of our God, if we alto- gether hold our peace at this time, shall  we not suffer loss when the Lord raises  up deliverance unto Israel. But for  Zion's sake let us not hold our peace,  and for Jerusalem’s sake let us not rest  until the light thereof go forth as bright- ness and salvation as a lamp that burn- eth.   and faith of the Saints and see that no  man take our crown, is the prayer of  your brethren in the Lord Jesus.   JOHNATHAN H. HALE.   lowing from elder Kimball, was intended for a private letter to his wife, conse- quently it was not expected by him to be placed before the public; but as El- der Kimball is like ourselves, a man that delights in plainess, and is not skilled in the art of daubing with un- tempered morter; we have taken the liberty to give it publicity almost en- ENDENTRY      have been waiting in earnest expectation for a number of weeks to hear from you again. I should have written you eer  not been for the consequent ersults of the late trouble at the west  the determinations of the church to remove to a more hospitable clime &amp;c &amp;c, &amp; as we your Parents verily supposed, their son Wilford would never engage in this great enterprize without first visiting ^his native^ land because firstly, they were conscious that he not only had children in his native Land but also some property there which they concluded he must of necessity attend to before he left these united States, &amp; secondly that he had Parents there who had for some time past been looking to him as one  probably be able &amp; willing to assist them in gathering with the Saints &amp; their other dear children who had gone thither &amp; whom they much wished to see, &amp; that now as the church had determined upon a remove across the California surely they thought it could not be long before he would be returning to the West &amp; make calculations to call on them to stir them up &amp; assist them in preparing for the great event viz to aid them on to the West &amp; give them a little time to rest &amp; visit their Children untill the opening of the spring when they  final leave with the church &amp; in the strength of Israels God engag in  we had the account that the church would all remove, &amp; told your father, that I would write as it was high time we had, but that it was not certain but that you might have had the news sooner, as soon as we &amp; that you might be returning before a Letter could get to you &amp; knowing your zeal in things pertaining to the Kingdom of God we finally thot best to omit writing you, your father had often said I wonder Wilford dont write us or, that we do not recieve a communication from him, if he is coming on this fall &amp;  know how W. will be visit for the means to assist us in going the answer was at hand, viz that I thought &amp; felt that as he had from time to time assisted the Saints especially when in England to come to America that that they might go to the Land of Zion &amp; that now, as he would in all probability desire to help his Parents &amp; other relatives to go with the church that the Lord wold open &amp; prepare the way before him by granting him means sufficient to accomplish the desired object. Indeed your father &amp; myself have fell much on the subject I can say that it has looked very pleasent to me to think of going even across the Rocky Mountains ENDENTRY  Father said, before the trouble at the west after reading a descripti- on of California that there was no place in the world where he should like to go as well as to California but, enough of this strain   we have had since their trouble, &amp; it was with a trembling hand, that I broke the seal, yet we learned therefrom that they were all in the Land of the living, &amp; in somewhat comfortable circumstance, yet the contents of the  same were such in general as to sicken our hearts &amp; give us the worst of feelings but  first place our children spoke of the removal of the church as tho they had no part nor lot in the matter, &amp; principily because they had no means to assist themselves to go &amp; no information that anyone would lend a helping hand to assist them, there is something Wilford that looks quite dark to us in this affair &amp; there seems to be a good deal of it too if we can judge anything from their communication &amp; here arises a question in our hearts which seems at this time hard to be solved viz,  must be crazy, but I can tell you Son W. that for near thirty years your Mothers mind, or the exercises of the same have in almost every instance where any thing of a serious nature was about to transpire have proved to ^be^ as a preface to the final result &amp; now I now not how to understand the excercises of mind I have had of late, when contrasted with present appear- ances, our Children write that you have been counciled to go Direct from England to California. If a thunbolt had racked our house I should not have been more astounded than upon reading this declaration. I have ever believed since I became aquainted with spiritual things that the work of the Lord never clashed, but here is something that looks so much like it, that I am filled with wonder &amp; astonishment, now I would ask one question or two, has not President Young been made aquainted with the fact, that you had Parents who were in the decline of life, &amp; who of course looked to you as their all as it were especially as to the privige of gathering with the Saints &amp; that altho they have other sons who would gladly receive their society &amp; do all that lay that lay in their power to render them every necessary assistance  after all, the moment they should  go to dwell with or near by their  sons they would be constrained to give up their religion or the principles of the Gospel unless they should conclude to live in one continual conflict as have the Saints in Illinois I say has Presid- dent Young been made aquainted with these facts as also that you have an only Sister residing in Nauvoo, who has for a number of  years past been in a very peculiarly afflicted state not only in reg- ard to her own health but also on the account of the misfortunes of her companion in life, &amp; consequently would stand in special need of some little assistance from her Brother in such an import- ant crisis as the present but if this has not been the case It does appear ENDENTRY  that there could not probably be found one in the whole church who volunteering to emigrate with the Saints in England would subjugate so great a number to the heartrending trials which must necessarly ensue upon your departure frome the Isle of Great Brition to the Territory of California. We have as a family in former years seemed to be marked out as it were with special blessings from the hand of God, but in the present case it seems that we are  hand of God, or that of Man for special disappointment. I have never expe- rienced any thing that looked to me so unreconcileable as the councili- ng you to start from England for it does seem to me that reason &amp; discretion as well as the  having a case for natural friends in such an immergency for if such friends do ^not^ manifest a case who will. It appears that Webster have not had the information as to ^the^ Saints removal that your father &amp; myself have  had viz the article written by Mr Hastings on the advantages of emigration to California the account of the richness of fertility of the soil the spontane- ous productions of the same, the arrangements &amp; rules laid down for the Journeying thither &amp;c &amp;c or I am sure they would have exspressed themselves differently on the subject, they say that the church had determined on removing not really beyound the bounds of time &amp; space but to a place where they can have a little more space &amp; also peace, that they were in fact going into the wilderness probably far beyond the Rocky Mountains the Identical spot they do not know that the spirit of persecution had become so strong that the church could stay there no longer, but, (they add) if they do not see such a time of hardships, privations &amp; dangers in this undertaking that they have never before experienced, they shall be much mistaken as they can have nothing to subsist upon but what they take along with them, that the rich in Nauvoo, had covenanted together to assist their poor to go after preparing themselves, but as ^for^ its being a possible thing for them to help their poor near all away, it could not possibly be done, that they had that. Wilford would come that way &amp; bring us along, as it would be the last opportunity we should have of gathering with the Saints, that as to themselves they could make no calculation about the Journey, as they had nothing to calculate with but E. says I would not like to miss of going with the church, &amp;c &amp;c, for my part after perusing the the accounts of California it looked to me that it would be altogethe better for the Church if they could get there &amp; as to the journey there has been nothing in that which looked dark if performed, &amp; arranged according to the directions of Mr Hastings but has looked pleasantly to me, &amp; I believe also to your father but I have but a short time since written to Cousen Betsey encouraging her in the belief that that they would in all probability have an opportunity of going with the church &amp; that I had every reason so to do, as I had read over &amp; over that it was the intention to take all the Saints, &amp; surely I thought our family connection would stand a good a chance as any others, &amp; we could probably each family of us raise somewhat towards the exspences &amp; that by having your assistance we might be prepared or even if there should be a little wanting we might obtain that from the church or some other way I have felt as tho should your father lay the matter before some of our neighbors he might probably get some assistance  ENDENTRY  &amp; their friends would be in suppose you should actually go as we have had intimation. I cannot think, it will be so, if for no other reason than  could never again say, that they had not been conf- ounded while endeavouring to trust in the Lord god of Israel, &amp; the scriptures tell us that such shall never be confounded in  that if indeed President Young has given such council to you that it proves that he is not ordinarly possessed of as much wisdom as any ^other^ person on the earth, but rather his having so much business to attend to did not think to end of sideways text   friends whom it would be your duty to see to on this important occasion, but the special predicament I illerded to would be  would not either be with the church nor get to our children at Nauvoo, nor they to us, because they would not be able to do of themselves alone. It does actually seem the most strange thing in the world that since you are the only Male member in our family who has any connection with this church that the minds of the  Twelve have ^not^ had a conscious responsibility is resting upon you in regard to your somewhat numerous frie- nds for Indeed had your Father a suf- ficent supply of means to help us on the journey still, you know we should  need your aid, &amp; as you are so well acq- uainted with travelling, &amp; your father so little, but I have filled my sheet you see &amp; some over. I will say, that we  1 or his &amp; very much prized the contents of the same We shall hope to hear from again soon. Ofter our Love ^to^ &amp; best wishes for Phebe that the blessing of God may rest on your &amp; your family &amp; also upon your Parents &amp; that his will may be done in ^this^ great move of the church,  is the most earnest desire &amp; prayer of your Mother &amp;    wrote me privious to my addressing her that things looked quite dark to her on account of not only her Mothers state of mind &amp; her own poor health but also the removal of the church which Indeed she thought would be for the best, but the thought of being  left with this gentile nation to partake of its judgments as well as being seperated from the Saints filled her mind with gloom. the fact was she had recieved the Messenger all except the two No which give an account of the determination to take all the church along with them those two she had not had which  led me to write her as I have stated      AMERICA LIVERPOOL DE28 1845         FARMINGTON DEC 1 C   Stanley Building Bath Street Liverpool England end of upside-down text ENDENTRY      get the " am obliged for the favor but to whom I am indebted I do not know unless yourself I have read some of the com- munications in the " interest but I must have leave to say that I do not  admire the style and spirit of the Letter from England particularly that part which related to the pious devotion of brother Kemball to his   between the crucifixion of  of ones wife and children and why the latter clause was added I cannot conceive unless to prevent the jealousy of his wife.   however render accounts of good health and general prosperity I believe the situation of our family in Farmington is more agreeable than before the sojourn in Eunice express their satisfaction with the advantages of good society which they enjoy and I immagine they improve it better than they formerly did. They write that they receive every desireable attention.   the pursuit of an interesting subject, by an "inexpressible" but I am happy to assure you that no harm was done or  other effect produced than the Excitement of a few  sensations which soon wore off leaving me  But to return—I was speaking of the confusion ENDENTRY  in Sister Eunice. If she was not our only sister or if I was less sensitive or less susceptible of the warmer sensibilities of human nature I should probably never have occasion to allude to my sister in refference to any change in me. There is indeed a change in me since you saw me but in some respects it is not such a change as you  would naturally expect to find. In that particular  respect in which I have not advanced to that  character which you would expect and to which I shall refer you. I trace the cause to my deep de her—and my great an advance with my years to the deportment of manhood and to the pursuits and tastes of ripen years I am more  you saw me last. It appears to me that trifles which would be objects of desire at the age of twelve afford me as much gratification as at that period of my life and in the choice of companions I am never so well pleased as in the company of boys and girls.   those over 12 or 14 years for past that age they are in my estimation past the age of  perfect loveliness. And to think of paying my court to a  own age would seem an absurdity which I could scarcely surmount. If I have a coat at the Tailors it is as much an object of desire with me to see it completed as with a boy to get a    ENDENTRY  accomplished in my business I am as much elated as is the same boy when he gets permission to spend a week at his uncles in the city.

I am much interested in the account of your visit among our common friends and I know not that anything could afford me higher pleasure than to participate with you in the joy of such an occasion. It has been our lot to be seperated for a long time and under circumstances rather unusual. Yet it does not appear to me that there can be any reason to apprehend that the kindred ties  degree loosened their bond. We are still brothers— and friends and while we have a father around whom to rally the purer sentiments of our hearts, have we not a mutual pledge of Enduring affection—of brotherly love? I am aware that the correspondence that has passed between us since we parted has not been of a character to evidence the highest degree of brotherly regard for we have been perplexed with the cares and anxieties of life and by the mysterious phenomena of mind have been widely seperated in our views hence it is not strange that our intercourse has been interrupted. But we do not look to the regular and uniform interchange of written communication for a pledge of each other's affection—we have this assurance in the nature of our relations and in our capacity to appreciate Each others claim.   interested me—you are mistaken—I have ever read your  letters with satisfaction and have only at times wished that they contained a more particular account of your personal affairs, being more interested in them than in the great "common cause".

In the application of the principles of these doctrines, however I imagine I shall not for some time be able to see the propriety of the course pursued by Mormons. I do not indeed believe that the prominent doctrines of the sect are peculiar to "  the gospel was preached by a large number of every sect and I have yet to be satisfied that these popular doctrines were not introduced into the Mormon Economy in an arbitrary manner to decare the influence and favor of that respectable portion of community.   and of "Mr Smith" (the prophet) or indeed any of the  pretensions of the "Saints" of which I am informed I do not think them unreasonable.

Every prominent doctrine of Mormonism may  leaders of the sect, those indeed who assume to them- selves the high prerogation of teachers from God to man may be rotten in heart, corrupt in life and ignorant of the first principle of holy religion These are some of my views.

I have felt a good deal of interest in the accounts you give of your travels in the ministry more particularly per- haps because it is a matter which concerns your welfare though I  to admit that I do not feel a good deal of interest also in the progress the work in which you are so successfully engaged. I have followed you to the  field of contest and there my apprehensions were excited for you as well as account of your exposure to the evil designs of the world as to the contagious malady which prevailed to so alarming a I feared that the hand of the violent man would fall upon you—that the abuses of the vulgar and the coarse minded would be heaped upon your head as upon the head of an outlaw and a ruffian, and that no voice would be heard in your defense declaring that you were innocent of any evil designs upon the peace of comm- unity. Then the work came as on the wings of the wind that a deadly contagion had visited your camp and that scores had already fallen before you and could I rest and be at peace while my brother stood exposed to the shafts of death! But another word came which told of the breaking up of your bandy—of its disperson to East and to the South to the North and to the West and you were placed before me a wanderer over the fair of the Earth in the capacity of a preacher of doctrines which were a by- word and a proverb among men. I already fancied I saw you exposed to the ridicule and the scoffs of bigots, hypocrites unbelievers wicked men and devils and was pained at indignities and insults which I imagined were being heaped upon you and I had not even the consolation of knowing that you were engaged in the cause of  see you suffer persecution, under the full persuasion that you would be blessed and honored by the King of Saints) though I did not doubt that you believed you were doing right and that you bore along with ^you^ a   not a word respecting you – what might have befallen you I was in doubts  I felt a fearful apprehension that  angry insurrection had been plotted and was discovered just upon the eve of its breaking out—the people of the South were inflamed and their vengeance was visited upon many innocent and unsuspecting persons, there  was no liberty of speech there and a person had only to be  entertaining sentiments appored to  to be visited with all the horrors of a hellish anarchy. Under these circum- stances my emmotions were such as I cannot well ^express^—my fears were of the gloomist character for I knew your enthusiasm and your determination to maintain your  sentiments you were appored to the institution of slavery and in the fear of God you would be constrained to raise your voice against it, a course which would have brought upon you swift destruction from the presence of  men—and my forebodings were bitter indeed. If I had any hope for your safety it was in the kind care of providence—I had no confidence in the protection which would be afforded you in the plea that you ENDENTRY  I was permitted once more to hail your return to your friends, and to rejoice in the triumph you had thus gained over the enemy and had the happiness once more to peruse the lines dictated by your brotherly kindness. I saw you engage in preparing yourself for the more efficient discharge of your duties as a minister of grace and among your fellows I imagined you giving and receiving counsel in relation to matters app- ertaining to the interests of "the Church" I saw you taking upon yourself the flowery yoke of matrimony and, (believe me) I rejoiced in the consideration that in subm- itting your neck to the yoke you had found a true yoke-fellow in whom you might not only find an assistant bearer of your burdens and sharer of your sorrows and joys but also an agreeable companion who should sweeten the sorrows of your life, and heighten the enjoyments of your happier hours by her cheerful smile and devoted love. I saw you bending your way to the far East to enter a new field, even to speak the word to the "Islands of the Sea". I followed you in your journeyings and saw you commence your labors upon the Islands—rejoice in your sucess—prayed for your comfort and safety—lamented the bigotry and intolerance you encountered, and left ashamed with you that men, nay—that those who present themselves to the world as  should so far depart from the  (to say nothing of the principles of the religion they profess) as did thou preachers and Elders who so ungenerously opposed you.

If it is untrue or if in other terms Mormonism— from Heaven God forbid that one of us should be under its influence another day.

Several of his letters  of late have been very strongly pleading against any  change. I have written him to-day upon these points  and explained to him the position and informed him  that though Guions were our friends and we felt kindly  disposed to them, yet this was not a matter of senti- ment, but of money. Our poor people were not able to  pay large amounts and it was quite a consideration with  us to have a low fare. Besides, Mr. Huntington had  been an undeviating friend of ours for many years in  political matters and had rendered us aid on many  occasions, and always responded when called upon; so ENDENTRY  had no regard for us. He seems to be troubled about  transportation from the Continent and seems to think that  no one can have the same advantages that the Guions Co. has had in this respect. But before we engaged  with the Guions Co. our people were brought from the  Continent without any difficulty, and we presume by  a little management they can again be transported to Liverpool in the same way.   cerning your interviews with Maude and Dellie has  been very satisfactory. Their letters also have been  quite encouraging, and Maude is particularly kind in  his expressions concerning yourself and the associations  they have had with you.

ENDENTRY    Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-  day Saints, in General Conference assembled:   Latter-day Saint will recognize the value of union, not only in action but in the matters of faith and discipline. As  to the rights and authority of the Priesthood of the Son of God, it is of the highest importance of opinion among the officers and members of the Church of  Jesus Christ of Latter-day  Saints. Feeling the necessity if a cor- rect understanding of this prin- ciple, we deem it proper at  this sixty-sixth anniversary of the  organization of the Church in these last days, to prepare and present state- ment on the subject, embodying the  doctrine which has always prevailed in the Church, and our views upon it. We are prompted to adopt this course at the present time because of events which have happened during the late political contest. A great diversity of  opinion on the subject has been ex- pressed, and even by leading Elders in the Church, which latter fact has naturally led in some instances to  considerable division of sentiment.   derstand each other and that there be  harmony in our teachings. It is espec- ially important that these teachings shall be in accordance with the rules and regulations and doctrines which have been taught and which have pre- vailed from the beginning until the present time, having not only the sanction of undisputed usage, but the  approval of all faithful leaders in the Church and of Him in whose name and by whose authority they act.   reference has been made, the presiding authorities in some instances have been misunderstood. In other instances  they have been misrepresented, which has led to a wrongful conception of their real views. It has been asserted too freely, and without foundation, that there has been a disposition on their part to in- terfere with individual liberty and to  rebuke in some men a course which  was applauded in others. In a word, that they have appeared to desire to assert and maintain an unjust and op- pressive control over the actions of the  members of the Church, and in thus doing have endeavored to effect a Union of Church and State. In the heat of political discussion,  asser- tions have been made and ar- guments used conveying to the pub- lic mind a false idea concerning ENDENTRY  Church, and leaving the impres- sion that there has been and was now being made an attempt to ac- complish the union above referred to. Now that the excitement has passed, and calmer reason has resumed its sway, we think it prudent to set forth, so that all may understand, the exact position occupied by the leading au- thorities of the Church.   the most positive and emphatic lan- guage that at no time has there ever been any attempt or even desire on the part of the leading authorities referred to to have the Church in any manner encroach upon the rights of the State,  or to unite in any degree the functions of the one with those of the other. Peculiar circumstances have sur- rounded the people of Utah. For many years a majority of them in every por- tion of the Territory belonged to one Church, every reputable member of which was entitled to hold and  is easy to see how, to the casual ob- server, it might appear singular that so many officers of the Church were also officers of the State; but while this was in fact the case, the distinc- tion between the Church and the State throughout those years was carefully maintained. The President of the  Church held for eight years the high- est civil office in the community, having been appointed by the national administration governor of the Ter- ritory. The first secretary of the Terr- tory was a prominent Church official. An Apostle represented the Territory in Congress as a delegate during ten years. The members of the Legisla- ture held also offices in the Church. This was unavoidable; for the most suitable men were elected by the votes  of the people, and, as we have stated, every reputable man in the entire com- munity held some Church position, the most energetic and capable hold- ing leading positions. This is all natural and plain enough to  those who consider the cir- cumstances; but it furnished oppor- tunity for those who were disposed to  assail the people of the Territory to charge them with attempting to unite Church and State. A fair investigation of the conditions will abundantly dis- prove the charge and show its utter falsity.   are leading officers, we desire again to state to the members and also to the public generally, that there has not been, not is there, the remotest desire on our part or on the part of our co- religionists to do anything looking to a union of Church and State.   any attempt to curtail individual liberty – the personal liberty of any of the officers or members of the Church. The First Presidency and other lead- ing officers did make certain sugges- tions to the people when the division  on party lines took place. That move- ment was an entirely new departure, and it was necessary, in order that the full benefit should not be lost which was hoped to result from this new political division, that people who were inexperi- enced should be warned against hasty and ill-considered action. In some cases they were counseled to be wise and prudent in the political steps they were about to take, and this with no idea of winning them against their will to either side. To this extent, and  no further, was anything said or done upon this question, and at no time and under no circumstances was any attempt made to say to voters how they should cast their ballots. Any charge that has been made to the contrary is ut- terly false.   themselves, the feeling was generally expressed in the beginning of the po- litical division spoken of that it would be prudent for leading men not to ac- cept of office at the hands of the po- litical party to which they might be- long. This counsel was given to men of both parties alike – not because it was thought that there was any impro- priety in religious men holding civil office, not to deprive them of any of the rights of citizenship, but because of the feeling that it would be better under all the circumstances which had now arisen to avoid any action that would be likely to create jealousy and  ill-feeling. An era of peace and good-will seemed to be dawning upon the people, and it was deemed good to shun everything that could have the  least tendency to prevent the con- summation of this happy pros- pect. In many instances, how- ever, the pressure brought to bear upon efficient and popular men by the members of the parties to which they belonged was of such a character that they had to yield to the solicitation to accept nomination to office, or sub- ject themselves to the suspicion of bad faith in their party affiliations. In some cases they did this without con- sulting the authorities of the Church; but where important positions were held, and where the duties were of a responsible and exacting character, some did seek the counsel and ad- vice of the leading Church authorities before accepting the political honors tendered them. Because some others did not seek this counsel and advice, ill-feeling was engendered, and undue and painful sensitiveness was stimu- lated; misunderstanding readily fol- lowed and as a result the authorities of the Church were accused of bad faith and made the subjects of bitter reproach. We have maintained that in the case of men who hold high positions in the Church, whose duties are well defined, and whose ec- clesiastical labors are understood to be continuous and necessary, it would be an improper thing to ac- cept political office or enter into any vocation that would distract or remove them from the religious duties resting upon them, without first consulting and obtainig the approval of their  associates and those who preside over them. It has been understood from the very beginning of the Church that no officer whose duties are of the  character referred to, has the right to  engage in any pursuit, political or otherwise, that will divide his time and  remove his attention from the calling already accepted. It has been the constant practice with officers of the Church to consult—or, to use our lan- guage, to "counsel"—with  their breth- ren concerning all questions of this kind. They have not felt that they were sacrificing their manhood in do- ing so, nor that they were submitting to improper dictation, nor that in so- liciting and acting upon the advice of those over them, they were in any manner doing away with their individual rights and agency, nor that to any improper de- gree were their rights and duties as American citizens being abridged or  interfered with. They realized that in accepting ecclesiastical office they assumed certain obligations; that among these was the obligation to magnify the office which they held, to attend to the duties in preference to  every other labor, and to devote them- selves exclusively to it with all the zeal, industry and strength they possessed, unless released in part or for a time by those who preside over them. Our view, and it has been the view of all our prede- cessors, is that no officer of our Church,  especially those in high standing, should take a course to violate this long- established practice. Rather than disobey it, and declare himself by his actions defiantly independent of his associates and his file leaders, it has always been held that it would be better for a man to resign the duties of his Priesthood: and we entertain the same view today.   reference has been made, and to the diversity of views that have arisen among the people in consequence, we ENDENTRY  our position, so there may be no cause hereafter for dispute or controversy upon the subject.   promulgate as a rule that should al- ways be observed in the Church and by every leading official thereof, that before accepting any position, political or otherwise, which would interfere with the proper and complete discharge of his ecclesi- astical duties, and before accepting a nomination or entering into engage- ments to perform new duties, said official should apply to the proper au- thorities and learn from them whether be can, consistently with the obliga- tions already entered into with the Church upon assuming his office, take upon himself the added duties and labors and responsibilities of the new position. To maintain proper discipline and order in the Church, we deem this absolutely necessary; and in as- serting this rule, we do not consider that we are infringing in the least de- gree upon the individual rights of the citizen. Our position is that a man having accepted the honors and oblige- tions of ecclesiastical office in the Church cannot properly of his own volition make those honors subordi- nate to or even co-ordinate which new ones of  an entirely different character; we hold that unless he is willing to counsel with and obtain the con- sent of his fellow-laborers and presid- ing officers in the Priesthood, he should be released from all obligations associated with the latter, before ac- cepting any new position.   these requirements of ourselves and our brethren in the ministry, we do not in the least desire to dictate to them concerning, or to interfere with the affairs of the State; neither do we consider that in the remotest degree we are seeking the union of Church and State. We once more here repudiate the insinua- tion that there is or ever has been an attempt by our leading men to trespass upon the ground occupied by the State, or that there has been or is the wish curtail in any manner any of its func- tions.

I have  labored principally alone upon these  Islands, since Elder Hale left last fall,  and the work of the Lord has prosper- ed in my hands, or in other words, the  Lord has worked with me during the  winter. Elder Joseph Ball has been  with me for a number of weeks past  upon the Islands. There is rising of  40 members in the church on these Isl- ands, and they are strong in the faith.  I returned last evening from a mission  in company with Elder James Town- send. we have been visiting the most  notable cities and vilages in the eastern  country, and delivering unto them the  word of God.

They do not know it  yet, but are wondering why these pa- pers do not come. We have appointed  a time to meet the church, and we  shall lay all these things before them  and trust in God for wisdom to direct  us. The Elders that are with me are  expecting to go to their homes, and I  shall be left to fight the battles alone.  Brethren, pray for me out of Zion,  for I have a load to bear; but in the  name of Elijah's God, I am determined  to stand at my post.

But we ask,  can it not be consistent with the will of  God and your feelings and circum- stances, to soon publish the Elders' Journal from Zion, that we may have  one weapon, to cut away some of the  deep gloom, that will be cast upon the  minds of thousands of the Saints, by  wicked men and devils, and false breth- ren. The traveling Elders feel the  wait of these things, equally, if not  more than those who are in Zion; for  we are naked targets to the press and  tongue, as we pass through the midst  of the Gentiles. O my God! have  mercy and support us, I pray, through  the toils that are to come, that our gar- ments may be washed white in the  blood of the Lamb! for it is through  tribulation that we inherit the blessing  and overcome.   ued, it would be great relief to the feel- ings of all the faithful; for while our  enemies are publishing against us,  even in Kirtland, we should also know  what God is doing for his Saints.   this last clause, not for our sake alone,  but for the sake of all the faithful that  are scattered abroad.

"For life is but a name, when virtue  and truth is gone."   awaits the world speedily, Kirtland not  excepted, and we do believe that those  who have dissented from the body of the  church, will have cause to lament for  their folly. We ask in the name of  reason and revelation, who has power  to take from Joseph, the keys delivered  to him by the God of Isaac,  and Jacob, and deprive him of the  work that God has said he should per- form? We answer, none but God  alone. We believe the book of Mor- mon and Doctrine and Covenants,  speaks too loud upon the subject, to  fall unfulfilled and to be made void, by  those who have neglected prayer, and  departed from the living God, and  sought to take honor unto themselves.   O ye Saints of God in Zion! we en- treat you to uphold Joseph by prayer,  faith, brotherly love, and charity: for  we testify, in the Spirit of God, that he  will be brought off conqueror, and his  enemies put to shame.   bors for your salvation? Nothing but  a God has supported him to the present  day. His perils are great, and the  greatest are among false brethren;  and we do entreat the Saints in Zion  not to add to his wounds, by following  the example of many in Kirtland.— Bear with us, ye Saints of God, while  we exhort you to keep the Celestial  law of God, while in the land of Zion.   Beware of pride, lest you fall like oth- ers. We do not make these remarks  for compliment sake, we feel what we  say. Kirtland is and will be scourged,  to fulfill revelation and prophecy; it is  all right, the hand of God is in it.   God's work will not stop. He will  work for, and with his Saints.

ENDENTRY  Principals and Faculties of all Church Schools:   Education, the peculiar condition of the Church affairs compelled  us to be careful in holding out hopes of financial aid in the organ- izing of new schools; we therefore confined ourselves to the an- nouncement of some of the principles upon which it would be  desirable to have our new educational system organized and con- ducted. But the active energy displayed by so many of the Stakes of Zion, in response to our first circular, not only in organizing their respective Boards, but also in proceeding at once to raise sub- scriptions to procure furniture and apparatus, and to call for Princi- pals and Teachers, furnishes proof that the time is ripe for the in- troduction of this new educational system, and that the people are ready to sustain and carry it out.

In too many instances, in the course of the years,  this grand object has been lost sight of in the toil for daily exist- ence, and less noble aims have largely taken the place of the en- deavor to learn the ways of the Lord and of the effort to walk in  His paths. This benumbing influence on our spiritual life is widely  felt in our homes, and more particularly affects our children, whose  faith in the great latter-day work has not been developed and  strengthened by the experience which their elders have had in lands  beyond the borders of Zion. Nor does the training which our  youth receive in the District Schools increase their feelings of devo- tion to God and love for His cause, for, as is well known, all teach- ENDENTRY  ies permitted in these institutions.   grow out of a Godless education, the Church schools of the Saints  have been established. But while these accomplish great good, the  sphere of their usefulness does not cover the entire field. There are  many places where Church schools cannot, at present, be estab- lished; and also many Saints in those places where such schools ex- ist, who, for various reasons, cannot send their children thereto.  For these causes we have deemed it prudent to suggest to the vari- ous local authorities other measures which, while not occupying the  place of the Church Schools, will work on the same lines, and aid in  the same work in which the Church educational institutions are en- gaged.   established, that some brother or sister, or brethren and sisters, well  adapted for such a responsible position by their intelligence and  devotion, as well as their love for the young, be called, as on a mis- sion, by the Bishop, after consultation with the President of the  Stake, to take charge of a school wherein the first principles of the  Gospel, Church history, and kindred subjects shall be taught. This  school to meet for a short time each afternoon after the close of the  district school, or for a longer time on the Saturday only, as may in  each ward be deemed most consistent with the situation of the peo- ple and most likely to secure a good attendance of the children.

Where the  regular school room cannot be obtained, some building conveniently  situated, and as near as possible, should be secured in its stead; the  object being to secure the attendance, as far as possible, of the chil- dren of all the Latter-day Saints.

ENDENTRY    WEEKLY     DESERET NEWS COMPANY         Jesus Christ of Latter- day Saints.         Semi-annual Conference of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, that an epistle should be addressed to the members of the Church, in con- formity with the custom which has been observed at the past five General Conferences.     vented, by circumstances well known to the Saints, from appearing in pub- lic, the Church will naturally look for some expression from them concern- ing their feelings and hopes respecting the work of our God. Especially at the present time is deep interest felt in the utterances of the Apostles, because of the loss which the Church has sus- tained in the death of PRESIDENT JOHN TAYLOR. Twice before has the Church mourned the death of its President, and each time the event has produced a profound impression upon its mem- bers. In this instance this sad event is invested with more significance than it would have been had it occurred in the ordinary way. President Taylor died in exile. For about two years and a half he had been compelled to live in seclusion, and to refrain from all public association with the people whom he loved more than he did life.   called the third time to mourn the de- parture of the man who has stood as its President and as the Prophet, Seer and Revelator to this generation. The experience which the Saints have gained in passing through these trials has been of exceeding value to them. They have learned that God can take care of his own work, and that they need not worry nor yield to anxiety or doubt concerning its management.   Joseph there were pretenders who as- serted that they had the right to take his place at the head of the Church. Some were deceived by their preten- sions, not being familiar with the or- der of the Priesthood.   APOSTLES.   Prophet Joseph was inspired of the Lord to anticipate his own departure from earthly scenes. This was shown in various ways; but especially in the great anxiety which he displayed to bestow upon the Twelve Apostles all the keys and authority of the Holy Priesthood which he had received. He declared in private and in public that they were equipped and fully qualified, and that he had rolled the kingdom of God on to the shoulders of the Twelve Apostles.   TESTIMONY.   man living in the flesh who was pres- ent upon that occasion feel it a duty I owe to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, to the House of Israel, and to the whole world to bear this is my last testimony to all nations, that in the winter of 1843-4, Joseph Smith, the Prophet of God, called the Twelve Apostles together in the City of Nauvoo, and spent many days with us in giving us our endowments, and teaching us those glorious principles which God had revealed to him. And upon one occasion he stood upon his feet in our midst for nearly three hours declaring unto us the great and last dispensation which God had set His hand to perform upon the earth in these last days. The room was filled as if with consuming fire; the Prophet was clothed upon with much of the power of God, and his face shone and was transparently clear, and he closed that speech, never-to-be-forgotten in time or in eternity, with the following language:   of heart for fear that I might be taken from the earth with the keys of the Kingdom of God upon me, without sealing them upon the heads of other men. God has sealed upon my head all the keys of the Kingdom of God necessary for organizing and build- ing up of the Church, Zion, and Kingdom of God upon the earth, and to prepare the Saints for the coming of the Son of Man. Now, brethren, I thank God I have lived to see the day that I have been enabled to give you your endowments, and I have now sealed upon your heads all the powers   hoods and Apostleship, with all the keys and powers thereof, which God has sealed upon me; and I know roll off all the labor, burden and care of this Church and Kingdom of God upon your shoulders, and I now command you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ to round up your shoulders, and bear off this Church and Kingdom of God before heaven and earth, and be- fore God, angels and men; and if you don't do it you will be damned.”   room at that time burns in my bosom while I record this testimony, and the Prophet of God appointed no one else but the Twelve Apostles to stand at the head of the Church and direct its affairs.     passed away by foul assassination, those who possessed the Spirit of God and were living in close communion with it, knew the voice of the true shepherd and were not deceived by the claims of men who pretended to have authority. The body of the Church followed the leadership of those whom God had chosen, and whom His ser- vant Joseph had been instructed to prepare for this great responsibility. The Twelve Apostles, with President Brigham Young as their head, became the presiding council of the Church.   learned in regard to the Priesthood, and the rights of the Priesthood, have never been forgotten. When Presi- dent Young was taken from us, there was no jar nor division of sentiment among the Apostles; and among the people there was scarcely a question as to where the right of Presidency rest- ed. President John Taylor took the position which belonged to him, and the work of God moved forward with- out interruption, and with a union and harmony on the part of all connected with it, most delightful to wit- ness. He has stood at our head for nearly ten years, and during that period he has possessed the gifts and qualifications which belonged to his high office and calling. His entire career is one that can be contemplated with the utmost satisfaction and pleas- ure by all who love the truth and ad- mire integrity in those who are called to be servants of God. From the time that he was baptized a member of the Church until his spirit took its flight from earth, he never wavered in his ad- vocacy and defense of the principles of righteousness. Under all the varied circumstances through which he and the people of God were called to pass, in the midst of the deepest trials and afflictions, his voice was always raised in tones of encouragement and hope; and when the storms were the fiercest, he rose to the occasion and always displayed undaunted courage and un- flinching devotion to the Zion of God. In the providence of God it fell to his lot to be with the Prophet Joseph and Patriarch Hyrum when they were martyred for the truth, and he mingled his own blood with theirs. Though severely wounded on that occasion, he miraculously escaped death. He was a man whom the Lord loved. The evidence of this is to be found in the fact that He chose him to preside over His Church at the departure of His servant Brigham. We feel thank- ful to God our Eternal Father that we have been permitted to live with and enjoy the society of President John Taylor and his fellow-laborers. Our assocation with him and the Presidents and Apostles who have gone before him into the spirit world, we esteem as a great honor. We take delight in anticipating the rejoicing that we shall have when we shall be permitted to mingle in their society.   presiding over the Church has fallen upon the Council of the Twelve Apostles. The Counselors of Presi- dent Taylor, Brothers George Q. Cannon and Joseph F. Smith, being members of the Council of the Twelve Apostles at the time they were chosen to be members of the First Presidency, have, since his death, taken their places again as members of that Council.   elapsed since the Church was organ- ized. In looking around among those with whom we associate to-day, how few there are left of those who, under the Lord, helped to lay . the foundation of this work and were the companions of the Prophet in the early labors connected therewith. To-day there is but one Apostle left of those who belonged to the Council of the Apostles during the lifetime of the Prophet Joseph, or, indeed, at the time these valleys were first settled. The other faithful Apostles who were ordained under the direction of the Prophet Joseph have all passed behind the veil. Since the death of President Young four have joined him in the other world, and in the same period six have been ordained as members of the Council of the Twelve Apostles. This gives some idea of the changes which are occurring, and how rapidly a new generation is taking an active part in the building up of Zion.     to travel, have devoted our time to visiting the various Stakes, and in meeting with them at their Quarterly Conferences. Some of us have been laboring in Arizona, besides visiting the Stakes in Idaho and in Utah. These Quarterly Con- ferences are attended with excellent results. The people come together and receive instructions and coun- sel upon leading topics, and much good is derived therefrom.   for the Apostles to visit them, yet we are encouraged in doing so by the ad- vantages which those visits bring to the people in keeping them informed concerning general movements and counsel. In these labors we have had much joy and satisfaction, especially in witnessing the increase of faithful- ness on the part of the Saints.     have been compelled to be absent, some of them having been incarcer- ated in prison, the people have, never- theless, been steadfast, and have sought with increased dilligence to per- form their duties. The persecution to which they have been subjected has led the people to think and act for themselves, and not to depend so much upon others for guidance. This can not fail to be attended with good results. It is necessary that all the members of the Church should exer- cise their powers of reason and reflec- tion and thoroughly understand why they take the course which God points out. Intelligent obedience on the part of His Saints is desired by our Father in heaven. He has given us our agency to think and act for ourselves, on our own volition, to obtain a testimony for ourselves from Him concerning the truth of the principles which He teaches, and then be firm and unshaken in the performance of all which is necessary for salvation.   witnessing the dignity and courage which the Saints have exhibited through the trials of the past three years. Their conduct has been ad- mirable. They have displayed great qualities. The forbearance, patience and fortitude which they have ex- hibited are proofs that God has been with them. Outrages which would have goaded any other people into acts of violence have been of frequent oc- currence. In other communities men and women would be desperate under such treatment. But the Lord has given His people power to control themselves and peace has been main- tained. Riots and bloodshed have been avoided, and even under strong provocation, when blood was shed, the community restrained itself. Preju- dice may prevent our nation and its rulers from acknowledging at the present, how noble the demeanor of the people has been under these trying circumstances, and with the strong provocations which they have had to indulge in outbreaks; yet the time will come when all this will receive its proper recognition and due credit will be ac- corded to the Latter-day Saints to their magnanimity and self-control through- out this entire persecution.     been established among our people in all our settlements in these moun- tains, the advancement and training and benefit of all classes are amply provided for. Among no people of whom we know anything have such provisions been made for the salvation and care of the members of society of all ages as among the Latter-day Saints. If we and our children do not progress in intelligence and in the knowledge of all principles pertaining to life here and life hereafter, it is be- cause we do not avail ourselves of those facilities which are placed within our reach. We have the Primary As- sociations provided for the benefit of the young children of our Church, and their instruction in those simple prin- ciples which they can understand. We also have Sunday schools for the training and education of those of larger growth. In them they can learn the doctrines of salvation and the his- tory of the work of God, and be pre- pared for greater progress. Then we have the Young Mens’ and Young Ladies’ Mutual Improvement Asso- ciations, which have been organized, as their names imply, for the development of the young people of both sexes and their advancement in every thing that will qualify them for lives of useful- ness and honor. But besides these or- ganizations we have the various coun- cils of the Priesthood, to some office in which every young man who is worthy can be ordained. The young women, as they increase in years, can also find a sphere of usefulness in the Relief Societies which have been or- ganized for the purposes of assisting the Bishops and Counselors and Teachers of the Wards in caring for the poor and relieving the wants of the suffering and distressed. So that by means of these organizations, which are of vast interest to us as a people, every one from early childhood to ma- turity, can be led forward step by step, from one degree of knowledge to an- other until fully qualified to discharge all the duties of perfevted and honor- able manhood and womanhood.   have charge of the Primary Associa- tion are doing a most commendable work in arousing interest in the lit- tle ones and in teaching them in simple style those lessons which are adapted to their under- standings. We hope that in all our settlements these associations will re- ceive the constant care and attention of our wise and judicious sisters. The seed sown in the hearts of the children by the instructions imparted there will produce in years to come an abundant harvest that will gladden the hearts of the Saints who witness it.     cause in Zion continues satisfactory, though undoubtedly somewhat re-   its labors and associations of so many brethren and sisters who have in former years taken an active interest in its welfare. We notice, with pleas- ure, the constantly increasing number of schools, teachers and scholars re- ported by the officers of the Union and the evident care taken by the presiding local authorities in our settlements to have a Sunday School as one of the first institutions established. We are also gratified to learn that in most of the foreign missions of the Church Sunday Schools and Improvement Associations are being organized wherever practicable. In Great Britain, in Con- tinental New Zealand, and in the Sandwich Islands, as also in the branches scattered throughout the missions in the United States, these institutions are found contributing their influence in instructing and forming the character of the children of the Latter-day Saints.   are also accomplishing great good throughout our settlements. In connec- tion with them and the Sunday Schools, we desire to remind our brethren and sisters who are engaged in the praise- worthy labor of fostering these insti- tutions, that the original design in organizing Sunday Schools and Im- provement Societies among us was, that the children and youth of the Saints should be made wise in the principles of the Gospel and their faith be developed in the revelations of God. This the officers and teachers should keep constantly in mind. The books used should be almost without exception, the reveleations of God as contained in ancient and modern Scripture, together with the other works of the Church. The teachings, while direct, brief and simple, should be such as will increase the faith, de- velop the veneration and love, and draw out the intelligence of the youth- ful bearers toward the divine princi- ples of which by God's grace, we have been made the custodians. All at- tempts, however slight, to secularize these institutions and to change them so that they will not accomplish the ends sought for in their creation, should be discountenanced. The spirit and teachings of the Gospel should hold undivided control in all our ministrations connected with this cause. In the theological and other classes all discussions should be avoided as much as possible on sub- jects which God in His wisdom has not yet fully revealed. We know there are many persons who appear to take more delight in dwelling upon questions which are mysterious and cannot very well, in our present stae of knowl- edge, be answered than they do upon those subjects which are plain and simple and essential to present pro- gress. But the Lord has revealed so much that we can understand and that we ought to learn in order to be useful in the labors devolving upon us here, that we need not enter into discussions on subjects which in no way affect our happiness here or eter- nal salvation hereafter. In our theo- logical classes, quorum meetings and othe assemblies, therefore, these de- batable questions need not be dis- cussed or be dwelt upon to occupy the time of the members, to the exclusion of more profitable topics. In the Primary Associations, the Sunday schools and the Mutual Improvement Associations, singing should receive a large share of attention. Singing ex- ercises can be made a great attraction and also a valuable addition to the ed- ucation of the young. The interest that is now taken among us in vocal and instrumental music is a marked feature of the times, and this taste finds increasing opportunities for its development in the facilities which are now being furnished to all who desire its cultivation. Instead of having a select few act as choirs in these institutions to do the singing for the whole, the voices of all should be united in harmonious melody in giving utterance to the feelings of their hearts in hymns and songs. This will increase the pleasure of the meet- ings, and make all feel that they have an equal interest in worship and re- joicing.     as organized among us, is truly grand and beneficent. There is no limit to their labors and usefulness while suf- fering and want exist in our midst. To aid the needy by feeding the hungry and clothing the destitute is distinc- tively and peculiarly their mission. In the energetic performance of their duty human sympathy and divine mercy are beautifully harmonized. In extending relief to the poor, the love of God and of our fellows is clearly manifest. It is more praiseworthy for a relief society to be able to say “There are none in our Ward in need of food, raiment or shelter,” than to report thousands of dollars in hand, while the needs of the poor are un- supplied.   amount of good among us, and the members have been of greate service in assisting the Priesthood in the wards in caring for the destitute and in sup- plying the wants of those who have been in need of help. In these labors we desire to give them every encour- agement and to invoke the blessing of heaven upon them, and all their exer- tions for the benefit of suffering hu- manity.     it is proper that each Bishop and his Counselors should take the necessary   who live in their wards. They should call the Relief Societies to their aid in this labor. The reasonable wants of the poor should be supplied and the pangs of poverty and destitation should be averted. God has greatly blessed us in the fruits of our fields and gardens, in our flocks and herds, and in giving us comfortable habita- tions and means to sustain ourselves, and we should always remember the words of the Apostle James: “Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, to visit the father- less and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.”   policy of our people to encourage in- dustry and to repress idleness to every form, and to expect all persons to contribute, according to their ability, to their own support; still there are many cases where the aged and the in- firm, or the unfortunate, cannot, with the utmost exertion and economy, ob- tain through their own labors suffi- cient to sustain themselves. It would be a great evil among us to encourage any class in living upon the benevo- lence of the community. No system of begging should be permitted. Those able to work should be fur- nished employment. Persons who are properly disposed will be glad to ob- tain it in preference to being fed with the bread of charity; and all should be encouraged to labor according to their strength. This policy, if wisely pursued will prevent pauperism, de- velop self exertion and confidence, and produce self-respect. It is a cause of great pleasure to think that beg- gary is unknown throughout our set- tlements. There is no need for any- one, however destitute, to publicly solicit alms. But while this is the case, the sensitive and those who shrink from asking aid, who conceal in some instances, their poverty, should be carefully looked after by the Relief Societies under the direction of the Bishops of the wards, so that there may be no individual in any of our wards suffering for the want of food or any other article necessary to sustain or preserve life. The community whose hearts are open to the cries of distress, who are ready to administer of the substance which the Lord gives them to relieve their fellow creatures, may always depend upon the favor of the Lord, for he loves those who are kind to their fellow-men, and who admin- ister to their necessities, whose hearts are tender, and who readily respond to applications of this character which are made upon them, or who antici- pate them by giving freely to the desti- tute.     proper care taken in the collection of the fast offerings of the people. The first Thursday in the month has been set apart in the Church as a day of fasting and prayer. That day should be strictly observed. Fast offerings should be brought with a liberal hand to the Bishop of each ward, that he may be prepared to supply those who are dependent upon the ward for su- stenance. Some wards require consid- erable aid from the Church to help sustain their poor, because their own fast offerings do not supply them; while sometimes in the same Stake there are other wards where there are few, if any, dependent poor. Presidents of Stakes should make arrangements with the Bishops of the last named wards to transfer their fast offerings to the Bishop of some contiguous ward which has more poor within its borders than its own fast offerings will supply. In this way all the peo- ple can have an equal opportunity of doing their duty to the poor.     that those who are attentive to those and all other duties required by the Lord receieve His blessing. God does bless those who devote themselves with singleness of purpose to His work. If proof of this were needed, one has only to notice the condition of Elders in the various settlements who have spent years of their lives upon missions. Though their home affairs may have been left to the care of their wives and children, they are not dis- tinguished by their poverty from their fellow-servants who have remained at home.   satisfy ourselves also, that those who are generous in contributing to God's work are favored of the Lord. This was the experience of ancient Israel, and it is our experience. Yet in re- gard to voluntary donations there is too much carelessness, not withstand- ing all the precious promises con- nected therewith. The Saints should be reminded of the obligation which rests upon them. Our children, also, should be taught this duty, that it may become a fixed habit with them to punctually attend to these matters. Those who have strictly observed these requirements can testify to the great pleasure and many rewards they have received from their observance.   one of the safeguards which the Lord has adopted to avert from his people the evil consequences which follow the possession of wealth. He has told us that the riches of the earth are His to give; but He has warned us to be- ware of pride, lest we become as the Nephites of old. We know the ruin it wrought for them, and we should spare no precaution to prevent wealth having a disastrous effect upon us. Many can endure poverty and be hum- ble and live near the Lord who cannot bear riches. They become lifted up to ENDENTRY    get their God. Those, however, who remember constantly the teachings of the Lord concerning the earth and its inhabitants, and who contribute of the means which the Lord ink splot gives them to assist the poor and help carry forward the work of God, exercise a check upon themselves and give Satan less power to lead them astray. Under the pres- ent system of affairs, those who ac- cumulate wealth and are able to sup- ply themselves and their families with luxuries and advantages that are de- nied their neighbors, are in danger of becoming separated from the bulk of the people and forming a distinct class. But the day will come when a more perfect order will be introduced. Then it will be said there are no poor and no rich in Zion—that is, we shall not be divided into classes, but shall all possess everything of this charac- ter necessary for our comfort and hap- piness. But until then, if we wish our families and ourselves to remain Lat- ter-day Saints, we must be especially careful to guard against the deceitful- ness of riches.     us, as members of the Church, is to build up Zion. God has founded Zion, and we should seek to extend its bene- fits and blessings until all mankind. It should be our constant care to do nothing that will weaken its influence or power or retard its growth in the earth. This we should constantly im- press also, upon our children, that they may grow up filled with an abid- ing love for the work of God.   on this point. Many have pursued a short-sighted, selfish policy; and have worked to that which they believed was their own individual advantage without regard to the effect their ac- tion would have upon the work of God. Their eyes have not been single to His glory. Such a disposition has proved a snare to those who have indulged in it; they have wrought injury to them- selves, not to mention the effect their conduct has had upon Zion.     riage is ordained of God unto man. The instutition of marriage, in some communities of which we read, is fall- ing almost into disrepute. It is al- leged that there is a growing tendency in this direction among us. The cause is doubtless, traceable to the in- crease of wealth and the dis- inclination of young men to take upon them the burdens of a wife and family. As we depart from the sim- plicity of early days, we may naturally expect that this tendency will increase as young men may be restrained from offering marriage to young ladies un- less they can give them something like as comfortable a home as they enjoy under their parents' roof. Extrava- gant or luxuriant habits or training on the part of the girls will also have the effect to deter young men from marry- ing. Care should be taken by every person of influence to conteract this tendency, and to set before the rising generation the advantages which fol- low well-arranged marriages. No community can prosper and maintain a high standard of morality where there is a large percentage of unmar- ried young men and young women. We should deplore the increase of such a class among us, and all honor- able means should be used to prevent its existence. The young of both sexes should be taught that it is not necessary to happiness in marriage to be in the possession of wealth. In this country an industrious, economi- cal married couple can soon surround themselves with all the conveniences and comforts essential to life and hap- piness. The satisfaction each will have in after years in the enjoyment of the fruits of their joint industry and thrift will amply repay them for any in- conveniences or privations they may have been subjected to in the early days of their married life. The com- forts thus accumulated will be doubly sweeted unto them by the recollec- tion of their exertions in common to procure them. No rightly constituted and educated young woman will refuse an offer of marriage from a worthy, in- dustrious young man for no other rea- son than that he is not able to surround her at first with the comforts which she may think she ought to have. Young men who have a due share of the qualities which women esteem in a husband need not be afraid that girls of that kind will refuse them, because they may not be well endowed with this world's goods. They will cheer- fully bear their part of the burdens of life without repining when confident of the love and supporting and guiding hand of their husbands.     day Saints against forming the bad habit of incurring debt and taking upon themselves obligations which fre- quently burden them heavier than they can bear, and lead to the loss of their homes and other possessions. We know it is the fashion of the age to use credit to the utmost limit, and it is custom- ary for nations, states, counties and cities to borrow money, issue bonds and thus load themselves with taxes to such an extent that large numbers of the people are prevented from own- ing land or even the houses which they occupy. Thus the masses become ten- tants and have to pay rent for land and shelter. This is a great evil and one that we, as a people and as individuals, should carefully shun. Our business should be done, as much as possible, on the principle of paying for that   should be brought within the limit of our resources. The disposition to speculate and to take chances upon ventures of one kind and another should be repressed. There are many people who have been rendered home- less in our Territory by the neglect of this precaution. To raise funds to in- vest in some scheme which has ap- peared promising they have mortgaged their homes, only too often, to be dis- appointed and to find themselves with- out a place of shelter for themselves and their families. All this is wrong. If the penalty for such unwisdom fell upon the one who through those acts and influence it is brought about the con- sequences would not be so deplorable; but very frequently families suffer and the bad results are widely felt. We, therefore, repeat our counsel to the Latter-day Saints, to shun debt. Be content with mod- erate gains, and be not misled by illu- sory hopes of acquiring wealth. Re- member the saying of the wise man: “But he that hasteth to get rich shall not be innocent.” Let our chil- dren also be taught habits of economy, and not to indulge in tastes which they cannot gratify without running in debt.     people have, with wise counsels. Their extent and variety are immeas- urable. They cover every department of human life. So far as we have ob- served them, prosperity and happiness have been the results. Whatever difficulties we may have to contend with to-day are due, if not wholly, at least in great part, to our disregard of them. Is not this the experience and testimony of all the faithful Saints who have watched the progress of events among us? Had we observed these counsels, how many of the evils from which we now suffer would never have been known among us. Our neglect of them has brought its punishment, and the faithful can see it. But shall we not profit by the ex- perience of the past and act more wise- ly in the future? As the Lord has said (Doctrine and Covenants, sec. 90, ver. 36–37).   Lord, will contend with Zion, and plead with her strong ones, and chasten her until she overcomes and is clean before me: For she shall not be removed out of her place, I, the Lord, have spoken it.”   God's ways are infinitely superior to our ways, and that His counsels, though they may seem to call for sacrifice, are always the best and the safest for us to adopt and carry out. Thousands among us can testify to the truth of this from individual experi- ence. These thousands should com- bine and create a public opinion in fa- vor of obedience to the counsel of heaven that will have its proper effect upon our children and the inexperi- enced among us.     truth, that God will have all the glory and honor for the establishment of His Church and Kingdom on the earth. Man cannot claim it in this or any other age of the world. Nothing but the power of God could have brought forth the fullness of the Gos- pel, organized the Church, gathered His people to Zion in fulfillment of revelation and performed the work which has been accomplished. There- fore, as Latter-day Saints, we are obliged to acknowledge the hand of God in all the blessings we enjoy.     bers of the Church to carry out prac- tically in their lives the principles of the Gospel. In no way can we better convince the world of their truth than in showing in our acts and dealings with one another and with mankind the elevating effect they have upon us. We make high profes- sions, and there should be such a high standard of purity of life among us as to correspond with these professions. Our children should be impressed with this, and be taught that the name of Saint is so holy that they only who are pure in heart can claim it.   love our God and our fellow man and to deal justly and uprightly with all men, then our profession of it is vain. The Apostle says:   brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother, whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?”   our God by living our religion. It is vain to profess a love for God while speaking evil of or doing wrong to His children. The sacred covenants we have made with Him strictly impose upon us the duties we owe to one another; and the great office of religion is to teach us how to perform those duties so as to produce the greatest happiness for ourselves and for our fellow-beings. When the obligations of our religion are observed, no words are spoken or acts are committed that would injure a neighbor. If the Lat- ter-day Saints lived as they should do, and as their religion teaches them to do, there would be no feeling in any breast but that of brotherly and sisterly affection and love. Backbiting and evil-speak- ing would have no existence among us; but peace and love and good will would reign in all our hearts and hab- itations and settlements. We would be the happiest people on the face of the earth, and the blessing, and peace   upon all that belongs to us.   burnings and quarrelings and hatreds among us, they exist because we do not observe the religion which we pro- fess. They are not its fruits. Where these evils exist there is a crying ne- cessity for repentance. If any feel in- jured by the words or acts of their brethren or sisters, the Gospel points out and furnishes the way by which this injury may be repaired. Instead of talking about this to others they should go to the person or persons who have done the wrong and make their feelings known. If satisfaction is then made, that ought to end the matter; but if not, it can be reported to the proper officers of the Church for them to take the necessary steps to terminate the difficulties. In this way animosities and disunion can be pre- vented and confidence be maintained.     eral custom to partake of the sacrament once a week. If the teachings of our Lord, in remembrance of whom we observe this sacred ordinance, be regarded, no one who has trespassed can be per- mitted to share in it until he has made reconciliation. It is the express com- mandment of the Lord Jesus that no one shall be permitted to partake of His flesh and blood unworthily. A more perfect system to prevent the existence of improper feelings and wrongs, among brethren and sisters can not be imagined. If the Saints do their duty, difficulties do not remain unsettled beyond the Lord's day when they assemble to eat and drink in re- membrance of Him.     the Saints have had to contend with of late, they have pursued their labors in every direction with unabated zeal. This is particularly noticable in their attendance at the Temples. The wish to avail themselves of the opportuni- ties for attending to the ordinances for themselves and their deceased friends has, if anything, increased, and those employed in these sacred buildings have their time fully occupied in per- forming their duties there. It is evi- dent that the Latter-day Saints ap- preciate the blessings to be obtained through this Temple work. When we reflect that we have two buildings of this character already completed, furnishing abundant facilities for all who choose to go there to obtain the ordinances of God's house for themselves and for those in whose salvation they take so deep an interest, and that we have another Temple at Manti nearing com- pletion, and one in Salt Lake City, which we hope to see finished before long, our hearts are filled with glad- ness and we cannot refrain from prais- ing our God for His goodness unto His people in permitting them, notwith- standing the oppositions and many dif- ficulties they have had to contend with, to erect such structures and to dedicate them, according to the pat- tern He has given for these sacred uses.   can think upon this subject without being thrilled with heavenly joy for what God has done for us in our gener- ation, furnishing us, as He has done, with every facility to prepare us, our posterity and our ancestors for that eternal world which lies beyond the present life. The Latter-day Saints are, in truth, a highly favored people, and praise to God should ascend from every heart and habitation in our land for the great mercy and goodness which He has shown unto us. He has made us promises of the most precious character, and he has fulfilled them up to the present time. We would be the most ungrateful and unworthy people that ever lived if, after receiving such wonderful manifestations of His good- ness, we slackened in our diligence or nailed in our obedience and devotion to Him and His great cause.     received in preaching the Gospel throughout the Southern States, as we are informed by President John Morgan, has been much better of late than it has been at some other periods. The Elders are listened to with more patience and do not meet with so much of the spirit of mobocracy and un- reasoning hate. Additions are being made to the Church, and those who emigrate from that region have gener- ally settled in Colo- rado.   States under the direction of President W. M. Palmer, pursue their labors with undiminished zeal and with mod- erate success in bringing people into the Church. These fields of labor have furnished opportunities for num- bers of our young men to gain experi- ence in missionary efforts, and those who have this privilege return home, in the most of instances, better quali- fied to assist the local authorities where they reside in the labors of the ministry.   with considerable opposition in places, principally, however, from apostates. They find that field a much more dif- ficult one than it was in former years. The hearts of the people seem to have become hardened, and great indiffer- ence prevails in regard to religion. Still we learn from President George Teasdale, who presides at the present time over the European Mission, that the Elders who zealously enter into   ant cause for rejoicing in the success which attends their exertions. Throughout the Swiss and German Mission presided over by Elder Fred- erick Schoenfeld, and the Scandina- vian Mission presided over by Elder N. C. Flygare, the Elders are laboring also with commendable zeal and with gratifying results. An effort is being made at the present time to preach the Gospel in Turkey, where Elders Jacob Spori, F. F. Hintze have been, and are laboring, and even the land of Palestine has been visited, and in the late company of emigrants which reached this City from Europe, nine persons were gathered who had received the Gospel in that land, a land hallowed to us as the earthly home of our Redeemer, and the soil of which his sacred feet trod.   are laboring faithfully under the direc- tion of President William King, and everything is being done to improve the condition of that people and to save them from the destruction which threatens the extinction of the race. The plantation at Lale is still main- tained, and the Elders who have la- bored and who are still laboring there enter with spirit into the management of that property in a way to benefit as much as possible the native Saints. The attention of the Elders there is di- rected at present to the Navigator Islands, where some few years ago two native Elders from the Sandwich Islands were successful in baptizing a large number of natives and organizing them into branches. These Islands have not been visited by any of the white Elders, but it is probably that some of our Elders on the Sandwich Islands may in the near future make a visit there.   from New Zealand where Presi- dent William Paxman presides, continue to bring us gratifying intelli- gence concerning the condition and progress of the work there. The Elders are very successful among the Maories. Many of the white brethren have succeeded in acquiring the lan- guage of that race, which is cognate to that of the Sandwich Islands, and two of them, Elders Ezra T. Richards and Sondra Sanders, Jr. are now en- gaged, we are informed, in translating the Book of Mormon into the Maori language. In Australia the Elders are also laboring, but it is a much harder field than among the natives of New Zealand.     past teachings and in former Epistles to the subject of home manufactures. It has been, and we feel it still ought to be, a theme of inexhaustible inter- est to Zion; yet there remains an im- mense amount to be done in develop- ing our resources and furnishing facil- ities for the employment of the people. It is pleasing to note the progress which is being made in some direc- tions. Our woolen manufactures are gaining credit for their excellence in other communities as well as our own. But we export considerable wool even after all our factories are well sup- plied. If this could be manufactured at home, it would add greatly to the wealth of our community, not only in the profits which would accrue from the use of machinery, but in the employ- ment which it would furnish to many of our citizens. Besides the manufac- ture of woolen clothes, there is con- siderable home-made hosiery of excel- lent quality which is placed on the market.   manufactured in this Territory is gradually increasing; and from the feeling which now prevails we judge that many more branches will soon be added to those already in operation. The manufacture of soaps of various grades has now become a settled and paying business. A fine quality of hats is also made. Boots and shoes and clothing, glass, white lead, lead pipe, native paints, brushes, paper, printing type, starch, pearl barley and oatmeal are all manu- factured in the Territory, and many of these articles in sufficient quantities to supply the local demand and to ex- port to some extent. It is an encour- aging feature in the most of these en- terprises that those engaged in them are seeking to enlarge their facilities with the view to increase their produc- tion. We have a large number of children growing up among us who should be furnished with opportuni- ties to acquire skill to mechanism, manufactures, and other pursuits which are necessary for the comfort of man. It is not only incumbent upon parents to seek for avenues of prof- itable employment for their children, but it should be kept in view by the leading men of the Church in all our settlements. An idle man's brain, it is said, is the devil's workshop, and no community can propser and main- tain a high standard of morality that does not furnish employment for its members. Far better to work for low wages than not to work at all. But with proper care, and by putting in use the experience that many individ- uals in every settlement possess, there need be no want of remunerative em- ployment for the rising generation, and for others who may come in from abroad. It may not always be kept in mind, yet it is a fact, that any per- centage of idle persons in a commu- nity is a direct loss to the whole. It is unfortunate, also, for a community, when the young and enterprising are compelled to leave it and go elsewhere to find employment or room for the exercise   selves possessed. Settlements that are in this situation will languish and go to decay, while others that furnish facilities for employment will become thrifty and prosperous. The combi- nation of capital by means of co-op- eration would, in many instances, en- able settlements to start branches of manufacture and conduct them suc- cessfully. Chimerical schemes, how- ever, should not be encouraged, as their failure destroys confidence and makes it more difficult to obtain aid for worthy enterprises which might be made successful. Where co-opera- tion has failed among us, it has not been because the principle is defect- ive, but because of mismanagement, sometimes from ignorance and care- lessness, and sometimes, perhaps, from selfishness.   ments. We have a fertile soil, when properly cultivated, and an admirable climate. Grains, fruits, and vegeta- bles, as well as all kinds of stock, can be raised here, and as superior in quality as can be found anywhere on the earth. Care should be taken to raise the very best varieties. Our horses, cattle, sheep, and poultry, as well as our grains, and fruits, and vegetables, should be of the very best kinds, and no pains should be spared to keep them pure. Our sys- tem of irrigation does not admit of the cultivation of large areas of land. Our farms are moderate in ex- tent. This being the case, they should be cultivated in the most approved style, and the whole business con- nected in a manner to bring the best results. As facilities for education increase, there undoubtedly will be a marked improvement in the manage- ment of all these branches of busi- ness.     that is being taken among us in educa- tion; yet there is great room for im- provement. As the taste for what may be called book-learning increases, manual labor should not be neglected. The education of the mind and the education of the body should go hand in hand. A skillful brain should be joined with a skillful hand. Manual labor should be dignified among us and always be made honorable. The tendency, which is too common in these days, for young men to get a smattering of education and then think themselves unsuited for mechanical or other laborious pur- suits is one that should not be allowed to grow among us. Of course it is necessary as society is now organized, that the professions, as they are termed, should receive attention. But every one should make it a matter of pride to be a producer, and not a consumer alone. Our children should be taught to sustain themselves by their own industry and skill, and not only to do this, but to help sustain others, and that to do this by honest toil is one of the most honorable means which God has furnished to his children here on the earth. The sub- ject of the proper education of the youth of Zion is one of the greatest importance.   lifetime established schools in Provo and Logan, where the principles of the Gospel have been taught in connection with the other branches of education, and more recently similar schools have been commenced, and conducted with marked success; in Salt Lake, Beaver and Fillmore Cities.   ings received in the Logan Academies are very apparent and pleasing to all who have the interests of the young at heart, and we regret that such institutions are so limited in number.   Professors J. Z. Stew- art and their associates, these schools have done, and are now doing, a great work in educational advancement, by instilling a knowledge of the princi- ples of the Gospel of life and salva- tion into the minds of our children, upon whose shoulders the Kingdom of God must rest in the near future.   schools of this kind will be established in every city and village where the Latter-day Saints reside. In the meantime, however, the Saints should not fail to avail themselves of the privileges that are now offered them in the Provo, Logan, Fillmore, and Salt Lake Academies.     are aware, passed a law entitled “An Act to amend an Act entitled an Act to amend Section 5352 of the Revised Statues of the United States, in refer- ence to bigamy, and for other pur- poses,” etc.   this law the Perpetual Emigrating Fund Company and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are respectively declared dissolved, and in this Act it is made the duty of the Attorney General of the United States to cause proceedings to be taken in the Supreme Court of the Territory of Utah to wind up the affairs of said as- sociations.   upon the Attorney General, on the 30th day of July, 1887, proceedings were be- gun in said court by the United States against the Perpetual Emigrating Fund Company and its trustees, and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and its alleged trustees for the   ENDENTRY      the one and winding up the affairs of the other: asking in these suits to escheat to the United States large amounts of property alleged to be held by these two defendants. At the time of this writing nothing has been done in these cases further than to appear and an- swer these complaints. What the result of these cases will be, we, of course cannot now say. It is proper, how- ever, that we should speak upon this important proceeding and let the Saints know how the cases stand.   Company, as all of you well know, was conceived and organized for but one purpose, namely, to aid the poor of our people in their humble efforts to gather with their brethren. It has been for this charitable purpose, the object of the generous bounty of the Latter-day Saints, but at no time in its history has it owned any real es- tate, or any personal property, save sufficient for its absolute needs each succeeding year. The Church on the other hand has been the owner of property, the gifts and bequests of an earnest, sincere people, made for the purpose of aiding in the propacation of the Gospel of our Savior Jesus Christ. The effort now being made by our government to dissolve or wind up these associations and escheat their property, is the first of the kind in that history of our people, and is believed to be without histori- cal precedent in this country. When we say we shall watch these cases with deep interest, the Saints will readily believe that it is not alone for the property involved in these suits, but also for the principles and rights that are at stake.     from our settlements in Arizona is en- couraging; and we note with pleasure that the people of the settlements at Woodruff have conquered some of the difficulties with which they had to content, and which made their position very trying. Indeed, the news from all the Stakes there is gratifying.     taxes and support the schools, every- one of our faith is denied the privilege of acting in the capacity of a school trustee or teacher, and no one with our belief can take the test oath that has been prescribed by the Legislature. The situation of the people there is one that excites great sympathy. They are practically denied the rights of American citizens through the infa- mous test oath law which was enacted by the Legislature. It is very trying to their patience and bears heavily up- on them. But the day must come when they will be relieved from the operation of this infamous law.     efforts of our people to open and cul- tivate farms, and to surround them- selves with the necessaries and com- forts of life, are meeting with gratify- ing success. This is the more note- worthy because of the fact that the great bulk of settlers there have not had experience in battling with the difficulties that have to be met in the building up of new settlements in an untried soil and climate. Like the Saints in Wyoming, those who reside in Colorado have always received fair treatment and encouragement and kind consideration from their neigh- bors and the officials of the State.     gressing favorably and are gradually being strengthened, both at Diaz and Juarez. At the places named and in the Sierra Madre Mountains near the latter, we have nearly one hundred and fifty thousand acres  and agricultural lands.   raising, as the grasses are of good quality and great variety, while the climate is uniform, the temperature seldom reaching higher than 85 degrees or lower than an approach to the freezing point. The facilities for making comfortable homes there are excellent, the land, water and timber being good. A fine steam saw, shingle and lath mill, and a planer and moulder, are in operation, affording building material within easy reach of Juarez.   national and state officials in Mexico and her citizens generally, has been cordial and hospitable. By word and act they have encouraged colonization in the Republic.

The Book of Mormon, Voice of Warning, and numerous pamphlets have been published in the Spanish language and are being distributed ac- cording to ancient predictions. Thus the truth is being spread abroad among the seed of Israel through the means of the record of their fathers, as well as by the preaching of the Elders.     O.

The soil upon which   ductive, and the grain and vegetables produced are of excellent quality, and range for stock is abundant and nutri- tious. The colony is preparing for winter, and the families composing it will soon have their houses completed. They have opened a fine vein of coal within three miles of their settlement, which is on Lees Creek, Alberta, Canada.   there, by officials and people, has been considerate and kind, and the pros- pects for improvements and propserity are good. Brother Card would be glad to have any of the Saints, contemplat- ing a change of location, to join him, in that land, and we will gladly ap- prove efforts in that direction.     to you our own feelings of thankful- ness that we live in such an age, and that God has bestowed upon us His Holy Priesthood and has permitted us to take part in His great work. We are thankful that we are associated with this people called Latter-day Saints; that we live in a day when Prophets and Apostles have been raised up in the Church of Christ; and that God has stretched forth His hand to fulfill His great and marvelous pur- poses which have been predicted by the mouths of the holy prophets since the world began. We testify in the name of our Lord and Master, Jesus, that this is the great work of which the prophets have spoken, that God is the founder of it, and that it will stand forever, and accomplish all that has been predicted concerning it. Zion is established and will be redeemed. And it is our continual desire unto God that His people may be faithful in keeping His commandments and doing His will, so that they may be accounted worthy to stand, and their children after them, and inherit the great bless- ings which He has to bestow upon the faithful. The day is not far dis- tant when our Lord and Savior will be revealed from the heavens, and we should live in a constant expectation of this great event, and seek, with all the energy and power that we can exercise and obtain, to prepare ourselves, our households, and, as far as we have in- fluence, the inhabitants of the earth, for His glorious appealing.
