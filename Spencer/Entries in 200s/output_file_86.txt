 PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF:He had listened with attention to theremarks of the previous speakers. Hehad not time to dwell upon the virtuesof the deceased nor the consequencesupon the nation for the shedding ofthe blood of the Lord's anointed. John the Revelator beheld, in his visionon the Isle of Patmos, the altar of Godand under it the souls of them thatwere slain for the word of God, andfor the testimony they held. And theycried with a loud voice, saying, "howlong, O Lord, holy and true, dost notthou not judge and avenge our bloodon them that dwell on the earth?" Theywere told that they must "rest yetfor a little season until their fellowservants also, and their brethren thatshould be killed also as they were,should be fulfilled." Eighteen hundredyears had elapsed and their brethrenwere being slain for their testi-mony. The speaker had witnessedmany scenes like the present. Hehoped he would not be called upon tobehold many more, because they weremost sorrowful. Persecution had beendirected against all people who hadlived in godliness, and we were havingour turn. The Gospel fulness had been restored in these latter days throughJoseph Smith. The Prophet lived fourteen years after he organized thiskingdom, and by him every key of thePriesthood had been restored and wasnow held by men. We were command-ed to preach the Gospel, the principlesof which were unpopular. It is thesame now as it was in the days of Jesusand His Apostles. If those who per-secuted and slew them had knownwhat would have been the result to the Jewish nation, they would not haveacted as they did. So it is to-day withthis nation. We would be under con-demnation did we not declare the mes-sage we have to deliver. The Eldersare sent forth without purse of scripand these two who have been slain inTennessee would receive a martyr's crown. It was infinitely more desira-ble to be in their position than that ofthose who produced their death. It was now as anciently; the servants ofGod are called upon to offer the Gospelto the people and when they did and theirmessage is rejected it is for them tocleanse their feet and testify of the fact to their Father in heaven, and woeunto those who repudiate the gladtidings of salvation and their bearers.The speaker had several times seenthe blood of the martyrs shed in thisdispensation, but although the Gospelmessage had been carried into nationsafar off, in not one had the life of oneof the Elders been taken except in thisnation. The fact rendered him sor-rowful for his country. He had no vengeful feelings in his heart in relationto those who committed these fearfuldeeds; they were in the hands of God. The Saints should pray that God mighthave mercy upon this nationand upon all people. So faras the shedding of innocent blood wasconcerned there is no forgiveness forthat sin in this world nor in the worldto come. While we desire to avertsuch schenes as the one we commemo-rate, if we can consistently, we mustnot desert the cause of truth underany circumstances. 
 President Wilford Woodruff readfrom and commented upon the 112thSection of the Doctrine and Covenants.Portrayed the inevitable destructionthat would fall upon the world if theydid not turn from the error of theirways, and seek to God for His grace. Defined the duties of the Teachers;said that when the Teachers' came toour houses it was our duty to call ourfamilies together and to listen to whatthey have to say to us. Apostles aresubject to the Teachers in their callingas much as members. All mem should be honored in their Priesthood. A Teacher is a very important positionin the Church and Kingdom of our God. It is the Bishops' prerogative to act ina Ward capacity, and see that the lesserpriesthood perform all their duties. The Presidents of Stakes have exclu-sive jurisdiction in that capacity. AnApostle would not interfere with thator any other calling of the Holy Priest-hood where men are appointed to pre-side. The First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles wouldnot infringe upon or ignore any officein the Church. Apostle Franklin D. Richards and myself were appealed toin a certain case. This case had comebefore the Teachers, and the Teacherscited the offender to appear before theBishops' court, where the case was in-vestigated. The Bishops' court ren-dered a decision against the accused, who appealed it to the High Council, and that body sustained the decisionof the Bishops' court. The accusedcame to us. All that we could do wasto act as Teachers. We listened to the evidence adduced, and could not, as Teachers, do anything but advise that the decision of the Bishops' court becomplied with, and urge the offender tohumble himself and obey. He prom-ised to do so. President Woodruff ex-horted all to act in their callings andhonor the authority of God.

 President Wilford Woodruff address-ed the congregation. He thought if any generation needed a Prophet toguide them with the word of the Lordit certainly was the present. The Saintshad the privilege of rejoicing in the re-velations of God, given through hisservants. The Prophet Joseph was called in his youth and weaknessand was not educated in thethings of men. But through the influ-ence of the Holy Spirit the Prophet schooled himself until he was one of the greatest prophets that ever dwelt upon the earth. One expression thatJoseph was wont to make was, "Mybrethren don't know me." Nor didthe Saints understand the greatness ofhis mission, which was to lay the foun-dation for the work that was designed by God to accomplish the redemptionof the whole human family. Thatgreat prophet was the instrument inestablishing this work of God upon theearth for that purpose. But do theworld understand the mission of theSaints? No. They understood no-thing of the mission the Lord had as-signed to us.There were things which are calledspiritual and others called temporal,but each spiritual matter meant thatsome temporal matter was necessaryfor its perfection. The Saints should be taught by their Teachers as much in reference to their temporal matters as in spiritual for they are both connec-tion. If farmers went into debt formachinery that was really unnecessarythey should be taught they were notin the line of their duty. All Israel should learn to take care of the property the Lord had placed intheir charge. The Saints should paymore attention to their temporal af-fairs, and use wisdom as to what cropsto use and how to raise them. Zion must be built up. The people shouldnot go into debt, but endeavor to pro-duce what they consume and consume what they produce, instead of sending for goods from afar. Reformation wasnecessary in these things, for Zion hadto be built up upon the labor and cap-ital of the Saints. The judgments of God which the Lord had decreedshould begin in His house, were aboutto be poured out upon all the nations of the earth. Godheld the Saints responsiblefor the proclamation of the Gospel and the establishment of the Kingdom ofGod, both in a temporal and spiritualpoint of view. The manifestation of the power of God in bringing thesepeople from all nations to settle upthese mountain regions was a mightyevent in the history of the world. President Woodruff spoke in an inter-esting manner on incidents connectedwith the inspiration that characterized the ministry of the Prophet Joseph Smith. The Lord had never made such great promises to any people as he had to the Saints. None of the people should fear, for the strifewas not between the world and them but between God and the evil one. Weneed not worry ourselves about theChurch and its destiny, but do thatwhich God commands.

 PRESIDENT WOODRUFFSaid that he looked upon the Relief So-ciety as a very important organization. It was organized by the Prophet Joseph Smith. As an institution it has its rightsAll men and all women have theirrights. He looked upon it as proper forwheat to be preserved. He thought thatit was better when wheat is laid up fora long time for the Bishop to take thatwheat and give a receipt for it and whenit was demanded it would be on handThe Relief Society are doing a greatdeal of good. He felt to ask God tobless them. It is a blessing to savewheat. We have plenty now but it willnot always be so. All the prophecieswhich have been made will come to pass.He took a great deal of pride in all theinstitutions of the Saints. The superin-tendents and teachers of these variousinstitutions have a mighty work beforethem and he felt to ask God to blessthem 
 QUARTERLY CONFERENCEPresident Woodruff and a Num-ber of The Apostles Present.On Sunday morning at 10 a.m. the tab-ernacle was well crowded with people.There were present on the stand, Presi-dent Woodruff, Lorenzo Snow, F. D.Richards, Moses Thatcher, Geo. O . Pit-kin, M. W. Merrill, Orson Smith, LorinFarr, a number of high councilors andbishops.The choir sang and James A. Leish-man offered prayer. They choir sang"Lo the Mighty God Appearing."PRESIDENT WOODRUFFsaid after an absence of some five yearshe had again the privilege of meetingwith some friends in Logan. It has been about that [5 illegible words]traveling [4 illegible words]people. There is no land either an-cient or modern times who has hadthe power to preach the gospel save bythe inspiration of the Holy Ghost. Hespoke of his address to the children onSaturday and related his experiences oncoming here about 26 years ago. He thought that every one of the visitingbrethren on that occasion had passedaway. He named these things to showwhat time brings to pass. He felt to say to the brethren and sisters that thework of the Lord was just as true andjust as important as of any day in the history of the Church. The Lord keptthis congregation. He kept Joseph Smith and the Apostles and others tocome forth in this age to perform aa work. Any people in the earth in any age are a blessed people who have re-ceived the gospel, have received a plan of salvation by which they can gain anexaltation in the Kingdom of God. TheLord called Joseph Smith to come forth to this generation to stand at the headand no matter how many presidentsmay suceed him Joseph will stand atthe head of this dispensation. We havereceived that priesthood which is without beginning or end of days. No manhas sought to administer in the ordi-nances of the gospel without that priest-hood. This priesthood, does not belongto any other kingdom but to the Celes-tial Our influence and power dependsupon keeping within the circle of thispriesthood. When any one thinks or getsalong so far that the Church cannotget along without him he isvery much mistaken. Thespeaker [illegible] upon the import-ance of honoring the preisthood. Anyman who holds the priesthood has thepower to go forth in the world and dogood. He said that there was no timein his life when he had greater [need]in the Lord than when he was a [illegible]and was using his [illegible]. If any manwill magnify the portion of the priest-hood which he holds and magnify itthe Lord will bless that man.We have been driven and persecuted.We had to go through this experience.When we came it was a great trialto many of us. But had we not gatheredhere there would be a great deal withinthe [illegible] of the Bible which would havebeen unfinished. The Lord has greatlyblessed this people. If we will do ourduties as a people blessings will become[2 illegible words]. Zion will arise and theglory of God will rest upon her. There never has been but very few in the his-tory of the world who have in any age kept the commandments of God. Awarfare has continually been againstthem. A warfare commenced with theprophet Joseph and has continued fromthat day to this. It will continue untilthe coming of the Son of Man. Weought to feel thankful unto the Lord.We ought to labor to carry out theprinciples of the gospel. We ought to thank the Lord every day that we live.No man can contemplate the work thechildren will have to perform save bythe inspiration of the the Almighty. Weseek for the things of this life, for the honors of men, for riches, but whatare these things compared with theriches of etenal life. No Latter-daySaint should have any fears regardingthe Kingdom of God. The Lord willcarry out his work. I do not expect inturn a very great while on the earth. Iam not afraid to go into the spirit world.Since we have been in seclusion therehas been a disposition among our youngmen to break away from the priesthood.The moment you step outside of thepriesthood you withdraw from the protec-tion of the priesthood and are not in theCelestial Kingdom of God. I don't wantour young men to do that. Secretly theenemy goes to our young men and tries to take them away. All will not bethrown away. This kingdom will stand.I know it. The God of Heaven does not look anywhere else than to the youngmen and young women to carry on hiswork. There is nothing better on earththan the Kingdom of God. No people have better opportunities than are pre-sented in this kingdom. We want ouryoung men to be true and faithful. It isa great blessing to have a good family.Our enemies—I speak now of the fallenspirits—there are hundreds and thousandsof them. We have many things before us. The knowledges of eternal life willremain with us forever. We have hostsof them. The organizations of the young people are strong and powerful. It isdesired every man, woman and child totake hold of the principles of life and en-deavor to serve God on earth. In hisearly days the speaker felt as thoughwere lost, but when he found this peoplehe found his Fathers House. The Lordshowed him things which he had seenfulfilled. He felt as though he waswilling to go hence when the Lordwanted to call him. He invoked theblessings of God upon the people. 
 PRESIDENT WOODRUFFRead a few verses from the 68 Sec.of the Doctrine and Covenants. Hefelt to read those verses in connec-tion with Bro. Lyman's remarksconcerning the companion weshould have. The Holy Ghost isone of the principles of the Godheadand is a witness of the Father andthe Son. No man who speaks bythe power of the Holy Ghost willever teach false doctrine. It is bythis power that the Lord is estab-lishing this Church. It was by thispower that the Prophet JosephSmith organized this Chu[r]ch. JosephSmith did the work that he did bythe inspiration of the Lord. JesusChrist is our advocate with theFather. The mission of Jesus has been upon the earth since the dayof creation. It is by this powerthat we live. The Holy Ghost hasbeen a minister to man on the earth.The Holy Ghost was with FatherAdam. It has been with the prophets of God. Father Adam wasthe first on the earth who held thekeys of the presidency. The speakerstated that at Winter Quarters Presi-dent Young had a dream that the Prophet appeared to him and toldhim to instruct the people to getthe Holy spirit. No man in thisage or any other has ever had powerto go forth in the name of the Lordonly by the power of the Holy Ghost. No man can administer inthe ordinances of the gospel with-out the priesthood of God. Theearly prophets and patriarchs heldthe priesthood and administered byit. The Saints are together to-dayin this tabernacle because the priest-hood was given to Joseph Smith. Had we labored without this priest-hood and without the Holy Ghostthe people would have remained at home in the old lands. The speakerhad never accomplished anythingfor the Kingdom of God withoutbeing inspired of God. The Lordhad always chosen the weak things of the earth to accomplish His pur-poses. If any elder undertakes to do anything without the Holy Ghostit will be a failure. That spirit be-comes a principle of revelation if wewill only seek to understand it. Thespeaker related some of his experi-ence in England and the way thathe was inspired to perform his mis-sion. He was in the midst of thegreat apostacy in Kirtland. He wasone of the Seventies. It was a sor-rowful day. Oliver Cowdery toldthe prophet that the church wouldfall if he left it. Cowdery left thechurch but it has grown in a won-derful manner. The Lord does notintend that men should take honorunto themselves. He is going to establish His Kingdom. The Lordhas abundantly blessed this people. We all have reason to rejoice in theLord because of His blessings. Wecan confidently trust in the Lord.We have our enemies, so did theSavior. The devil sought to temptthe Savior. The devil sought to temptthe Savior but he did not succeed. We talk about prayer—there was noman who prayed more earnestlythan did the Savior unto the Father.We should feel charitable towardthose who are seeking our destruc-tion. The judgments will come andthey are near at hand. If we couldsee what things are coming thereare none of us who would envy ourenemies. Look at the changes thatare taking place. What do theyindicate? The coming of the Sonof Man. Let us be faithful beforethe Lord. The gospel has been preached to prepare the way of the coming of the Son of Man. The Lord prepared an element to receivethe gospel and to help build up thiswork. The Zion of God is here andit is organized to stay here. TheLord will preserve it. The speaker trusted that we might enjoy thespirit of the Lord. He was gladthat things were as well with thepeople here as they are. He invokedthe blessings of God upon the peo-ple. 
 PRESIDENT WOODRUFFSaid in the history of this world and thedealings of God with men it is said thatthe last dispensation is the greatest theLord has given unto men on the earth. In the establishment ofthe kingdom in this age the God of heaven knew perfectly well what shouldbe given the Saints in order to establishthis work. He knew just exactly whatHis servant, the Prophet Joseph, wouldrequire to do His work. The Lord and His Son visited him and the angel of God visited the young man a score of times He prepared him for the coming forth of the record which was to beunited with the stick of Juda and goforth to the earth to the converting ofthe human family. The Lord knew the sacrifice this people would have tomake. Lucifer knew that if he did not overthrow this prophet, this priesthood of God, his power would be taken from him. Here commenced a warfare in thebeginning of the restoration of the Gos-pel in this dispensation. The deviltempted the Prophet after a similarmanner to the way that he tempted the Savior. There was such power given toJoseph Smith that he knew perfectlywell that he was called of the Lord.While his enemies sought to destroyhim by the law he was saved by the law. The three witnesses who were shownthe truth of the Book of Mormon aposta-tized and turned against the Prophet,but they never denied the testimonythat they had borne. Just as quick asthe Church was [four illegible words]and His work. In the translating of the Book of Mormon Martin Harris obtainedcertain pages and they were lost, but theLord aided the Prophet and the enemy was foiled. After translating the Book of Mormon, in the order of time theLord gave unto Joseph the Priesthood. He received the Aaronic Priesthood andafter that he received the Melchezedic Priesthood. He baptized certain onesand afterwards he organized the Churchwith six members. The Lord prepareda class of men who were moved upon tosearch for the church—to seek for the Prophet and they received the Gospel.The same power which made war inheaven began to make war uponthe Saints. There was a wicked spirit entered into some of the Elders in Kirtland. It was the darkest daythat he had ever seen in the Churchand he never expected to see such a dayagain during his probation on the earth. All the Apostles but two were somewhat affected. The two were Brigham Youngand Heber C. Kimball. When theProphet returned he spoke in the Tem-ple and about one half of the quorum of the Apostles were cut off  The Prophet was filled with power. When OliverCowdery turned from the Church his power fell with him. He returned againinto the Church. Martin Harris died inthe Church David Whitmer died out-side.In the midst of this serious time thegospel was taken to England. At this time the speaker was led to go to the Fox Islands. He was told by Heber C. Kimball and president Rigdon to go andhe went, and the history of that missionis before the people. One blessing that has been poured upon the Saints duringall these persecutions was the HolyGhost. It has been a great comfort untothem during the persecutions. The Lord has not forsaken us in the midst ofall these things. The devil did not tri-umph in putting to death the Savior. Hedid not triumph when Joseph Smith and Hyrum were put to death. That sameprophet with his brother Hyrum willcome again to lead this people into theCelestial Kingdom of our God. JosephSmith holds the keys of the presidencyin this dispensation and will hold it for-ever and forever.Now we are in these valleys of themountains. We have had a time of peace to build [illegible]But [two illegible words][three illegible words] will not [two illegible words]to destroy this people. The Lord hasgiven us this land. When we go and sell our inheritances we give them intothe hands of the enemy. The speakerdid not believe that this people would beleft to go into the hands of the enemy sothat they will be driven from thesemountains we are a blessed people.This people are raised up for the purpose of redeeming their dead and whenever they endeavor to do this, theirenemies will be on the alert. Many ofthe fathers and mothers of the peoplewere good men and women. They de-sire a work done for them. The gospelis being preached to the spirits in prison. There is a great deal to do on the other side of the vail. The blessings andpower given unto us are greater thanwere ever given to a people in the world.He encouraged the people not to neglect their duty. Attend to the ordinances for the dead. The Saints are to become Saviors on Mount Zion. All the heaven-ly hosts are watching over the sonsand daughters of Zion. There is thatpower and glory in this work that he be-lieved that many of this people would remain true and faithful. He did notsee any reason why they should not. He knew that there were two powers on theearth. The power of God has been with this people.The Latter-day Saints have had a great desire for miracles. He had never asked the Lord for the visitation of an angel.The speaker related his experience onmeeting the prophet for the first time.He knew that Joseph Smith was a proph-et. He related his experience in Lon-don, England with evil spirits. He and George A. Smith experienced the powerof these spirits. The Lord sent messen-gers to them to preserve them. He didit because it was necessary. The Lorddoes not send messengers to answer thewhims of man. The greatest testimony to the human family is the Holy Ghost.It is a living testimony and it belongs tothe Latter day Saints. The holy priest-hood is given unto men to minister untothe living and the dead. For allthe good that men do they will berewarded, but when they talk aboutsalvation the priesthood is necessa-ry if men make advancement it will be by the power of the priesthood.The Devil is laboring for our destructionand he will try and divide us. He don'tcare how it is done. He will try to sep-erate husband and wife. But husbandsshould be kind to their wives and wivesto their husbands, and parents to their children. God loves us, he loves all of usand that principle should be with us. The speaker was glad to meet with the peo-ple. Let us try to keep the Lord with us that we may be prepared to sitdown at the great marriage supper ofthe Lamb. The choir sang and ApostleFranklin D. Richards offered prayer and Conference adjourned for three months. 
 PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFFDid not feel that he would be justifiedin finding fault with the farmers for notattending the meetings here to day. Weshould, however, remember the Sabbathday, to keep it holy. I believe the Lat-ter-day Saints are a good people, prob-ably one of the best that ever lived. Ifany people were treated as are the Lat-ter-day Saints, they would rise against our enemies. But that is notour plan. We believe in exercising hu-mility and wisdom and trusting in the L[or]d. Our p[eop]le es-pecially, have passed through muchsorrow and suffering during the years ofthe past, and a better class of peoplenever lived. We are under responsibilityto take an interest in the Sunday schoolsand to endeavor to instill cor-rect principles in the hearts ofour young people. Our mission-aries are trained in the various associa-tions that have been organized, and they should strive with all their mightto learn the truth of the principleswhich they are taught in those associa-tions. It was a great work undertakenwhen the Prophet Joseph organized theRelief Society in Kirtland and in Nau-voo, and that organization has accom-plished a great work and has been ofgreat assistance to the authorities of thechurch. A great many of our apostlesand prophets and brethren are in the spirit world, and the history of our liveswill soon close. We should labor tomake a good record, that we may withpleasure meet with those who havegone to labor in another sphere. Thewords of the prophets are before us, and they will come true, and the prophe-cies will be fulfilled to the letter. Maythe Lord bless the Saints of God thatthey may be able to perform the dutiesthat await them, and meet the trialsthat are before them. 
 PRESIDENT WOODRUFFaddressed the congregation. Saidof the 1,1000,000,000 people onearth today comparatively few holdthe priesthood and are authorized and called to preach the gospel to this vast number of people. Thisis a great work required at ourhands, and it must be done beforethe judgements of God shall come upon the earth. The Lord has pre-pared the people for this very pur-pose. The elders of Zion are choicespirits who were designed to comeforth in this day to assist in thisgreat word—Requested all to think and reflect deeply upon theconditions which surround us and strive to live in accordance withthe will of God. 
 PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFFI have a few thoughts to lay beforethe Saints, but I cannot do so intelli-gently unless I receive the benefit ofthe inspiration of the spirit of God, asmost everyone who essays to teachthe people. The subject which I wish to dwell upon is the principle of [[illegibleunity [[illegible said, "If ye are not oneye are nothing." [##Doctrine and Covenants 38:27##] This is an import-ant principle to me, and the Lord haslaid thickly upon us, to be united.The Lord has bestowed the power andauthority upon us to teach the childrenof men. These men occupy a positionin which they are compelled to seekunto the Lord, and have communionwith Him or, they could not carry thetruth to the nations of the earth. Thepropehts of old were under that neces-sity. The prophets of God in all ageshave been compelled to have com-munion with God. They have beencompelled to be united. The world may be divided, but the Saints of Godmust be united or they cannot prosper.With all the revelations and blessingsenjoyed by the followers of Moses, theytransgessed and worshipped a golden calf and were punishedfor that wrong doing. [##Exodus 32:1-8##] God answeredthe prayer of Joseph Smith when theProphet was a boy, and endowed every male member of the church with thepriesthood. Joseph Smith enjoyed theSpirit of the Lord day by day, and wasvery closely asssociated with Him andHis holy angels. The Lord commanded Joseph to set apart Twelve Apostlesto do the work of the Lord. TheseApostles were commanded to be unitedand to come and go at the bidding of the Lord. I have been associated with theTwelve for over fifty years, and I knowwe have been compelled to come and goand leave our temporal affairs to per-form missions in the nations of the earth.I have seen that the Council of Apostleshave been united as a general thing.Some of them have gone astray andturned from their callings and they areto-day in the spirit world, withoutpriesthood and without kingdom. Oneof the prophets at one time wanted tolay before Joseph a system for theChurch to use. He expained the sys-tem to Joseph and the Prophet said,"Yes, that is very good. I have but onefault to find with it and that is that itis not true."Brigham Young was faithful to theLord, and he was prospered and enjoyedthe Spirit of God. It devolved uponBrother Taylor and upon myself, to en-joy that Spirit and to have communionwith God. I am gratified to know thatthis is the case. I know that if we arenot united we are not in the line of ourduty. The various qurums should beunited. Our aim is high, and requiresfaithful service. We are fulfilling to-day the prophecies of the prophets of old. The eyes of God and the heavenlyhost have not been withdrawn but theyare watching us with the deepest inter-est. Persecution is our legacy, and we may expect to be opposed and hunted down by our enemies.Brethren and sisters, there is room for improvement here in Zion. Thepriesthood here should know that it istheir duty to exercise faith and to putaway their sins. I say if you exer-cise faith in prayer before God, youwill receive His spirit. Do not be discouraged. God is with you, andholds your destinies in his hands. Thechurch is all right, no matter whatour enemies do. But we muse be hum-ble and prayerful. I have seen thetime, my brethren and sisters, when I have been abroad performing mission-ary work, when I would have giveneverything on earth to grasp the handof a Mormon Elder. These otherbrethren here, Brothers Cannon andSnow, have doubtless passed through a similar experience. They have per-formed missions throughout the earthand God will reward them.We should not, my brethren and sis-[[illegible lineworld, for they are dangerous to us theLatter-day Saints. These things willtake us away from our faith.Let us honor our callings; let ushonor our priesthood, let us honor our brethren and those placed in authorityover us, that the blessings of heavenmay rest upon us.The choir sang, and the benedictionwas pronounced by Elder O. N. Liljen-quist, of Hyrum. 
 PRESIDENT WOODRUFF.was well pleased to again minglewith the Cache Valley Saints inconference assembled. Had beenmuch edified by the remarks madein the morning; the subjects treated were of much importance to the Saints.Referred to the wickedness of allkinds that is filling all the world. The evil one is doing everything inpower to engulf the children of men. The voice of the servants ofGod has been sounded in these days to all the world where theconditions and laws would permit. In all dispensations of the gospelthe devil has tried to overcome the servants of God. We should alllabor and guard against the at-tacks and temptations which the adversary made upon us, and by resisting them we would gainstrength over the evil one. Re-ferred to the early days of thechurch and the opposition theprophet Joseph and his associatesreceived from the people in theirday. Spoke of the judgments of God which should come upon thechildren of men in consequence oftheir refusal to accept the gospel ofChrist. Spoke of the visit of theFirst Presidency to Chicago and Jackson county with the Tabern-acle choir, and gave an account ofthe kind receptions they met withon that trip, which showed that a change had come over the nation. Exhorted the Saints to faithful-ness in keeping the commandments of God.

 Eden, Utah. March 12th, 1897.President Woodruff,Dear Brother,I have a few questions to ask and some information ^I desire^ to know.  First when the Elders administer to the sick sometimes I have herd them say that theyshall recover, then the^y^ die do they have the spirit of their calling when this acurs?When a Brother or sister Dies is the angles or ther good spirits at their bedsidewaiting for them.  Why is it that someare called leaving wife children or husband Sometimes in poor circumstancesIs their a work on the other side of thevail for us to do?  Do the spirits of enyever come back to commune with theirFamily ever?  your advice is to seekthe Spirit of God.  Do you value the Spiritof the Lord above eny earthly value, or ^eny^ ammount of money?Dear Brother I would be pleased to

 ELDER WILFORD WOODRUFFSaid he had felt, for a long time, theneed of a change in Zion. He believedthe time had come when we must pre-pare for greater usefulness in the king-dom of God. He knew it would takemore to prepare the people for union intemporal things, than it had in spiritualthings. There must be a unity of pur-pose in faith, spirit, labor and every-thing, before we shall be prepared to meet the Zion of God which is to comedown from heaven. He believed the whole world was getting ripe for theharvest, and a great change must takeplace among the Saints, that they might be able to do the work assigned them. The question arises, are the blessingspromised in the gospel, of more worththan the property which we are made stewards over? Was it going to take away anything we possess if we conse-crate it all to God? No. It would addto it. But we must beware of pride lestwe become like the Nephites of old. Wemust stop bringing in from the East and West things we could produce for our-selves. This was a suicidal policy. Letthe Lord rule and we obey; and it weenter into the order of union, there wasno fear that we should be deprived ofanything we need. He had no doubt Prest. Young had introduced this orderjust as soon as the hearts of the peoplewere prepared for it; and went on toshow how the principles of the gospelhad been revealed, gradually, as fast asthe people were prepared to receive them. This order would prevail and the spirit of it would flow like the waves ofthe sea, till it reached every settlement. The spirit of God would bear record ofthe truth of it. Babylon was bound tofail, and if we stay as we are, dependingon Babylon for necessaries, we wouldhave to go without. In this Order, hemeant to be ready to go and come just as he was required, and he considered this the duty of every member of it. The Relief Society could do a great dealmore than they had done, organizing themselves for the production of thingsthey and their families need. If this isthe Zion of God, he would say let us unite to build it up in the way the Lordhad appointed. 
 Nov. 19, 1897 The Lord being myhelper. I hope the Lord willoverrule every thing for mygood which I know He willif I faithfully serve Him and keep His commandments.Ever praying for the cause oftruth I remain your brotherin the GospelLewis SwensenJ W Irons 
 I hope and pray that I maybe humble and prarerful andbe able to bear testimony ofthe Lords great work in theselast days, to His names honer andglory. I will close by askingthe Lords blessings upon You andall the Holy Priesthood, and thosethat desire to serve the Lord.I remain your brotherin the gospel,Lewis Swensen. 
 PREST. W. WOODRUFFheartily endorsed all the remarksmade before. He was gratified thatthe Latter-day Saints did not enjoythe fellowship of the ungodly andwicked of this generation. This isthe last dispensation of the fulness of times; the devil doesn't like it,but the speaker does not blame him.The little handful on April 6, 1830,has increased to 150,000. Four tem-ples are being erected, wherein toredeem the dead. No wonder the devil fights this work, for he realizesthat his day is at the door.The wicked don't like us. Neither does the devil. He never did likethe work of light and truth. Thereis universal warfare between Heavenand hell, light and darkness, truthand error.We are here, dwelling in theflesh, destined to accomplish thepurposes of the Lord, and well may we be steadfast and truthful in the cause.Speaking to the young people,Prest. Woodruff showed how the revelations of old had been and arebeing fulfilled in these latter days.Considering the future of the risinggeneration, Elder Woodruff empha-sized the greatness of the work theyare engaged in, in this the greatestdispensation of all ages, for whichthousands of spirits were reserved for thousands of years.Looking back on the past years, when the Twelve had to go forth,preaching the everlasting Gospel to the unbelievers and scoffers, he re-membered how many times he askedthe question: "Where are the sonsof the prophets?" But now, look-ing on the rising generation, he wassatisfied that the work would notlack in staunch expounders and de-fenders. The speaker here gave avivid sketch of the corruption and abomination of the world, fromwhich emanate so many would-be"purifiers" of Utah.We trust in God. We will obeyHis will, dying or living; for we are not doing our will but His.Prest. Woodruff concluded with exhorting the young men to con-tinue firm in the faith of their fath-ers, persevering in the pursuit ofknowledge and the practice of allpure principles. Great are the judgements which are impending over the world in their wickedness.For God has decreed His work inthese last days, and thoughearth and hell combine they will notprevail. Great will also be the pow-ers with which the young genera-tion will be clothed in the days ofprobation. Prest. Woodruff also admonished the young men to mar-ry, and if they marry to do so in theright way.The young men are looked to bythe Presideny as the rising gloryof Zion, to carry off the great workthe foundations of which were laidby the Prophet Joseph. 
 Lorenzo F. HatchMay 22 [18]97. 
 Apostle Wilford Woodruff said:The Lord has had a motive in or-ganizing these associations, in in-spiring men to encourage, counsel,dictate and direct in these institu-tions; from them have got to come forth men and women who will beinstruments of the God of Israel, in carrying out the work which theirparents have commenced.As to the manner of conducting these Associations I cannot lay downany definite rules that will perhaps apply to everybody alike, and as faras I am concerned, I feel a good deallike letting everybody have their own free agency and do as theyplease, as long they do good. If youwish to have the Associations maleand female, all right, but if youthink more good can be accomplish-ed by having the sexes meet separ-ately, why, all right; if you will onlymagnify your callings as sons and daughters of the Lord, and prepareyourselves to step forth and take theplaces of your fathers and mothers.One thing I wish to encourage; I want our young men to spend thetime as much as possible in treasur-ing up the words of life. Of courseyou want variety, but I wouldadvise our young men to take the Bible, Book of Mormon, Doctrineand Covenants and read; not for thesake of seeing how many chaptersyou can read, but to try how muchyou can understand and remember. There is not a boy in Israel eightyears old who, if he could compre-hend that he is an heir to the greatblessings promised in these goodbooks, would feel that he has ten minutes to spare in reading a novel. He urged the young men to preparethemselves to go forth and spreadthe Gospel, and labor to benefit oneanother. I have said in days gonebye, Where, O where, O Lord, arethe sons of the prophets who are go-ing to take this responsibility off of us? To-day I see before me instru-ments in the hands of God, wherethe spirit and power of God can operate. I see rising up before me a generationwho are willing to go forth as theirfathers have done, and my heart re-joices. Go before the Lord in your closets, and open your hearts to Him in faith and he will answeryour prayers. The time will comewhen you will require faith to com-mand the elements, and they will obey.Another thing I want to say,when you wish to take a wife, re-member she has got to be a com-panion to you in time and eternity,and the mother of your children.I will close by saying, do not visit grog shops, and other similarplaces; keep your bodies and spiritspure, and use your influence withothers to do the same whenever youhave an opportunity. I would saythe same to my young sisters. Wecan afford to stand the injustices putupon us by the world, as far as the Lord will permit. 
 PRESIDENT WOODRUFFbore his testimony to thewords of President Cannon.The priesthood, he said, was the same throughout eternity. TheLord told me to choose for counsellorsthe men I have chosen. Of whatgood are they unless I consult withthem? When they give counsel theygive what the spirit gives them and what the spirit has told me and I thendo it. Why are the words of those named in the revelation, read byPresident Cannon, the words of theLord? Because they were spoken bythe Holy Ghost, one of the Godhead. 
 PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFFwas the first speaker of the afternoon.He said: It is five years ago since I spoke to you here and some of myyoung brethren are growing old.Though we who address you may beof the presidency of the church weare as dependent on the Lord for hisguidance and assistance as any elder or any one in the church holding the priesthood. We all need the spirit ofGod. There never was a man, aprophet or apostle who was not de-pendent on the spirit of God. I have promised the Lord that whatever hegave me I would give to the people.If he does not give me anything youwill not get much from me.There are many things concerningthe Latter-day Saints which occupymy mind. Next April it will be 60 years since the organization of thischurch. What a change has comeover the world since then. There was no one murder committed wherethere are now a thousand. Thosewho will read the newspapers find that it will take them two hours to read ofthe murders which occur in everytwenty-four hours. All these things areopen to the eyes of the Lord. The an-gels of God are waiting to go forthand reap down the earth because ofits wickedness.What is the destiny of the genera-tion that ripens in iniquity. The Bi-ble tells of it. Whenever the nationsturned from the Lord of Heaven and worshipped Baal they were chastisedand the judgements of God overtookthem. All the ancient cities, Tyre, Thebes, Babylon, Jerusalem andothers were in their time destroyedbecause of their wickedness and thatprogramme has been carried on tothe present day and will be to thecoming of the Son of Man. It is in-teresting to read the revelations andprophecies to read the revelations and prophecies in the Bible and Book ofMormon which tell of the future gen-erations.Fifty-six years of my life I have spent in the church and over fiftyyears in the apostleship. A whole quorum of apostles have been takento the spirit world and another or-dained since we reached these val-leys. I am the only apostle living of those who came into these valleys asapostles. I am the only man livingwho received his endowments underthe hands of Joseph Smith.The Lord has set his hand to carryout the ancient prophecies and hewill do it. He called Joseph Smithand others to the work and gavethem the priesthood. This seemsblasphemy to many, to talk of thepriesthood, but I defy any man in the Christian churches to show that Godever had a people whom He acknowl-edged as His people but that He gavethem the powers of the priesthood.The Lord could not set His hand to gather His people and to fill this dis-pensation except by the priesthood.It is by the power of God that youhave been gathered from all nationsto this land.I wish to say a few things to the Latter-day Saints with regard toyour position with the Lord and thegospel you have received I know this is a work of truth, that God is true,that Jesus Christ is true, that theprophecies and revelations are true.As the God has set His hand to per-form this work during the past sixtyyears will He now stop? No. He will continue and as prophecies have been fulfilled so will every word that has been written. When the workfirst began we could go into every city and baptize hundreds.I have traveled during my time 150,-000 miles while preaching the gospeland in every town and village I or-ganized branches and so did my brethren. Now our sons go out andbaptize five and six and think they have done a good work. And they have, for the vintage is over. TheGentiles reject the gospel. It is asmuch as a man's life is worth to preachto-day where in early days we baptizedour thousands The Gentiles reject the truth as did the Jews In the primi-tive days all who taught the gospelwere destroyed. The Jews fell intodarkness and in the fulfillment of theprophecies their city was destroyedand they have now for 1800 yearsbeen captives among the Gen-tiles a hiss and a by word. The yokeis yet on Judah, but it is to be brokenand they will gather home and meettheir Shiloh. In these last days thegospel has come to the Gentiles andwill afterwards go to the Jews. WhenChrist came the Jews received it first, rejected it and it went last tothe Gentiles. Thus the propheciesare being fulfilled that the first shallbe last and the last shall be first. To-day hell and wicked men exert alltheir power against the church carry-ing on a fearful warfare The Chris-tians tell us that apostles and prophetsand revelations were necessary onlyin the dark ages, but the Lorddoes not say so. He has revealed Hismind and will to this people.I will ask you a few questions. Youhave seen the gathering of the people.You have seen the history of thechurch Do you find anything inthese valleys to try you? You havethe water trouble and have a dryseason. If there is an elder in Israelwho will yield to temptation and be-cause of a dry season will go to lawagainst his brethren let him thus be tempted. He may as well betempted over the water question asany other. I do not expect one halfof those I have baptized to be savedfor they will apostatize before they reach the kingdom of God. Ifwe suffer any affliction it will be be-cause of our own actions. What theLord has said will come to pass. Zionwill be redeemed. If she sin theLord will chastise her but shewill be redeemed. If we sin that sincosts much more than it is worth. Thewater question causes the people todivide, go to law, and injure eachother My counselors have felt that if they go to law without arbitrationthey should be disfellowshipped, and Ifeel the same way. It is not setting agood example if we quarrel one withanother. I would rather have every-thing green on my place dry up thango to law against my brethren. I have a long eternity with them on the otherside of the veil. What, quarrel with them while here for a few days! No,I wish not to be responsible for it. Letus not go to war with our neighbors,or ourselves. The Lord will judge for us. He says "judgment is mine."There is no more escape from the judgments of God now than in agespast.Every man and woman who hasmade sacred covenants, go to theLord and make your wants known.Let the prayers of 100,000 Saints ariseto God and I tell you they will beanswered. You are His people, His sons and daughters. Make your wantsknown and He will bless you. I haveno fear concerning Zion. She will beredeemed. All the fear I have is thefollies we commit ourselves; from them we will suffer. Watch the signs of the times; the pouring out of the plagues;the judgments will come andthey will come as sure asthere is a heaven and earth. I havefelt to speak of these things for I willnot stay here long. I am going beyondthe veil to perform another work. Befaithful, watch and pray. Do notneglect your prayers; let all quarrelsand divisions among your pass away.Young men attend to your duties and prepare to bear off the kingdomwhile your fathers go beyond the veil.May God open your hears, your earsand eyes and fill you with wisdom;live your religion and you will be blessed. 
 President Wilford Woodruff addressedthe congregation and spoke substatiallyas follows:For quite a number of months any brain work has been so severe, that I have felt it right to throw off some ofthis work of speaking on my brethrenof the Twelve who are with me, I have been edified and interested. This testi-mony is applicable. What has beensaid in regard to the absense of Saints from these meetings does not apply tothose who are here.Our last conference here was crowded. The tabernacle in the various stakes, during conferences, are generally wellfilled. The Lord has not gone asleep,He has not gone upon a journey, He hasnot deserted his cause. The Lord hasdecreed from the foundation of the worldthe dispensation of all his dealings withmen, all these depensations have beenforeseen by the Prophets. We are ful-filling the prophecies in regard to thiswork, there is no greater work than thework in which we are engaged. Thechurch has been organized for 50 years, and there is no reason why we should lose interest in the work. We camehere because the Lord was prepared toperform a work. The 200,000 souls nowin the church were kepi in the spiritworld for six thousand years, to comeforth in this dispensation. What timehave we to spend foolishly? We havenone, it will be a loss to us when here,and hereafter.Read the history of the world suicideand sickness, death and desolation arebeginning to feel after the nations of the earth, These things will increase afterthe testimony of the elders has been re-jected, it is our duty to testify to all na-tions, after our testimonies come thesetestimonies of destruction. Thosewords have been spoken and will be ful-filled. We will be held on accountabil-ity for our works. The priesthood is givento us and we are held responsible forthis work to the extent of our positionsand callings. If I fail to do my dutyI shall be held responsible and so with the Twelve and every member of the church. We should wake up and realize our condition and responsibilitiesand labor to save the souls of men and perform all duties devolving upon usOur reward will be commemoratedwith the course we pursue in the flesh.The hand of God is in all matter tem-peral and spiritual. He will control allthings for our good if wee serve Him. Our political experience will be a bles-[i]ng to us. No man need be discouraged ordisappointed. The Lord holds the des-tiny of all people in His hands, whenwe come to the end of our lives we will[s]ee this more clearly. We have receiv-ed great blessings and great promisesand should commit no sin. The Lord wilsustain us if we do right. Our youngpeople should attend the various instu-tions in the church organized for theirbenefit, and become acquainted withthe principles of the gospel, and be pre-pared to withstand temptations. It issad to see our sons lead astray by evil influences. The powers of evil are bringing to bear all their efforts, and all theinfluences that can be brought to bearus astray. The Savior was tempted 40days; if He had yielded, the Devil wouldhave achieved a great victory, but hedid not. He gave us an example to fol-low. He prayed to the Father--Pray,pray always, there is where our helplies, even in temporal affairs, we should go before God. He will answer our prayers, and we will have power to overcome all evil. No man can lead as-tray the people, and if a presidentshould attempt it he would be removed.The authorities are sustained by thepeople's prayers and therein lies ourstrength. Men have apostized fromtime to time. In Kirtland one half of theQuorum of the Twelve apostatized and went against the prophet, but the Lordsustained him and he filled the positionto which he had been called, till theLord took him away. He performed hiswork, and will hold the keys of the grea[t]dispensation in the morning of the re-surrection. What is there to pay a manto sin or do wrong. There is nothing tojustify a man in doing evil, nothing tomake a man happy in disobeying thecommandments of God. Let us remem-ber the covenants we have made with the Lord. We should remember thecouncils we receive from time to time,and train our children in the ways of the Lord; it is a great comfort and con-solation when our sons walk in the waysof righteousness and do not follow in the paths of evil.This is the gospel of Christ and thework will stand in spite of all obstacles,and the saints will remain here tillChrist comes and will not be driven from their homes again. The speakerremembered when he was 20 years ofage a murder was committed in Con-necticut. That circumstance convulsed all New England. Today murders and suicides are a common occurance. Letus labor to get the children to attendSabbath schools and meetings that theymay become acquainted with the will of God. He had often said when a boyand attended Sabbath school, that he would esteem it a blessing above allblessings to live in a time when apostlesand prophets were upon the earth as in the days of the Savior, and had asked why the churches did not enjoy thegifts and blessings given to the earlysaints. He had been answered, theywere not needed now as we live in thelight and blaze of the gospel. Now weare blessed with the same blesings and ordinances as were the former day saintsHe hoped to live many years with thepeople of God and enjoy the blessingsof the gospel as he had done for thelast 60 years. He knew the gospel wastrue, he had received this testimonyfrom the first sermon he ever heard. Wehave a high destiny before us, andshould live pure and temperate lives inorder to be worthy. Prayed God to blessthe people with strength to do right and keep his commandments. 
 President Woodruff addressed thecongregation. He had not intended tospeak, but the remarks of PresidentSmith had laid upon him a duty to per-form. It was his duty to bear a testi-mony to their truth. There were manyin the congregation who had beenmembers of the church for from 30 to 50 years and they knew for themselves,that what Brother Joseph F. Smith hadsaid, was true. The God of Heaven hadcommanded the Latter-day-Saints to beunited, and they were the only people whom he had so commanded. Why?Because they were the only people whohad the gospel.In relation to the present positionthe speaker stated that he was notresponsible because God had calledhim for a short time to preside overthe church. As great a man as was Joseph Smith, he had seen men stand-ing in the temple of God, curse him tohis face. What had been the result?Why these men died miserably and went to hell. Again, God was responsi-ble for having placed him where hewas; and he was responsible for plac-ing his counselors with him. 
 PRESIDENT WOODRUFFarose to address the saints. He ex-plained that he had invited MotherThomas to the stand that she mighthear the speakers. He had baptizedher over fifty years ago in Tennesseeand eaten many meals at her tablewhen a missionary. Speaker then re-lated his early training; how underPresbyterian training he had learnedwhole chapters of the Bible, and he be-came convinced that the same gospelwas not taught today as in former days,at least not in the New England states where he went to hear all the preacherswho came into that neighborhood. Hehad prayed that the true gospel as ofold might be given him, and he be-lieved that gospel would come to him. He testified that he had received that same doctrine. The speaker rejoiced that he had lived so long as he had,and had seen so many of the prophesiesfulfilled. For eighteen hundred yearsthe world had been without the gospeland now it has again been restored, and we are called upon to perform a greatwork. There are prabably a hundredfallen angels to each living soul, trying to tempt us and turn us from the paths ofrighteousness. Those same spirit took ourSavior out in the wilderness and tempt-ed Him, and Satan offered Him every-thing if but Christ would worship the evil one. Those same influences stillexist, but the power of darkness cannotnow overcome the church of God. Joseph Smith will occupy the sameposition as to this dispersation thatJesus Christ occupied to the formerchurch. They will both come forthclothed with glory and immortality. This people is the one that must spreadthe gospel, and prepare the way for thecoming of the Savior. If the young men could only realize the importance of their position there is not one whocould be hired to smoke a cigarette ormingle with the drunken. Our actsare well recorded above and we will bejudged according to how we use thepower given us. Neither would anymaiden turn from the path of virtue, ifshe realized her position in the eyes ofheaven. The speaker was pleased tosee the zeal of the leading officers of our various organizations for improve-ment. The last days are upon us, as noted by the many crimes and deathby natural elements which are upon us. There is no time to lose, therefore, and we should all strive for knowledge and perfection. God bless our societiesthat are organized for our advance-ment. Whoever goes to the saloonsand other evil places will be sorry forit. Our young men should not allowthe devil to tempt them; say no whenhe tempts you. 
 President Woodruff believed he knewBrother Smoot as well as any manliving. The Gospel had gathered asgreat men as ever lived, and BrotherSmoot was one of them. President Woodruff then spoke to detail of hisearly acquaintance with BrotherSmoot, when they traveled together inthe missionary field in Tennessee andKentucky. They had gone togetherto Kirtland and the Prophet Josephhad become acquainted with BrotherSmoot. At one time in Kirtland onlytwo of the quorum of Apostles stoodby the Prophet; the others, who were dis[a]ffected, called upon thespeaker and Brother Smoot tojoin them in opposing the Prophet,but it had no effect upon thembec[a]u[s]e they knew that Joseph was a Prophet of God, and they warnedthose Apostles that if they [w]old notrepent they would go to perdition.Brother Smoot had power given himto guide and control; he walked straight forward in the path of duty,from which he never wavered. He was an affectionate man to his family and friends, and it was impossible to keep from sorrowing to an extent athis departure, but the speaker did not[f]eel to mourn at the death of anyLatter-day Saint. He felt to thankGod for such a man as President Smoot;it would not be a great time beforethe grave will give up its deadand Brother Smoot will stand at thehead of his family organization. Presi-dent Woodruff was glad to be able toattend the funeral, and had a great de-sire to have visited Brother Smoot be-fore his death but was unable to do so.
