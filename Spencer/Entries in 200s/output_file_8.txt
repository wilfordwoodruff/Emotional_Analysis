 May 10, 1850 ~ Friday      [FIGURE] 10th I wrote 2 letters to day to Father Carter to Luther  Scammands. We passed Fort Leavenworth called at weston in   the evening left some Freight & tried to run some in the   night, but we run onto several snags as the river abounds  with them, it is dangerous runing      May 11, 1850 ~ Saturday      11th A man came on board this morning and informed   us that many were coming back from the plains & selling  out their teams & going home & so oxen were falling   no grass grown yet, the Mary Blane was at St Josephs  Yesterday. It seems as though the world were vary blind   to rush onto the plains in such vast Numbers to go   to the gold mines before any grass grows to sustain the  Oxen. We arived at St Josephs in the evening & spent the night  I called upon James Townsend & Stephen Markham      May 12, 1850 ~ Sunday      12th Sunday We started from St Josephs at day light I was informed  that 25000 gold seekers crossed at St Josephs & gone onto the  plains we see them on both sides of the river to day in the  woods & on the prairie preparing to start out it is A plesant  day I sat on deck & looked at the travelling caravans through  my glass we run onto A sand Bank in the evening, & it took a  hards night work to get off.      May 13, 1850 ~ Monday      13th We were out of wood And all hands went on shore & cut  a few cords of wood to get along to whare some could be   bought we took on several cords about noon, it was a  vary plesant day      May 14, 1850 ~ Tuesday      14th [FIGURE] Early in the morning word was given out for the  passengers to go on shore & walk up the bank of the river   to lighten the boat so they could get up the sand   bars, they went on shore about two dozen men with  some mules two women & children left the river  & struck for the Bluffs so that when we got ready  to take in the passengers those persons could not be  found. One woman was vary feeble with two children  it was supposed they had fainted by the wayside the  captain & others rode miles in search of them could   not find them came back & wen[t] on with the steam   boat some 5 miles & found them all in a pile on the   bank of the River the woman nearly exhausted it  detained us several hours.      we passed many dangers this day the river being  full of snags, we stoped a few miles below fort Kearney   for the night. I wrote to Brigham Young a   letter of introduction to Dr S. M. Tibbits Also stated to  him our Number whare we were &c      May 15, 1850 ~ Wednesday      15th Arived at Fort Kearney early in the morning &  left all passengers & freight except what was for the  Bluffs we then went on to Deseret Depo whare we   arived about dark we here found Ilus Br Badlam & many others  this is about 18 miles Below Kanesville I spent most of the   night on my feet taking charge of Baggage     
 May 16, 1850 ~ Thursday      16th I rode upon the steamer to Kanesville & met with Br  Gibson & many others distance from St Louis to Kanesville [blank] miles  whole distance from Boston to Kanesville via  New York, Phil, Pittsburgh & St Louis [blank] miles  I went to Kanesville spent A little time atwith Elder Hyde   17ththen returned called upon Brother Alread & went  on board of the steamer & spent the night      May 17, 1850 ~ Friday      17 The boat started early in the morning & I returned   to Bethlehem or Deseret Depo And spent a Busy Day      May 18, 1850 ~ Saturday      18th [FIGURE] I wrode to Kanesville in Company with Elder   Bablam I saw Elder Hardy spent A little time with him  I then went to Elder Hydes I there met with Elder   Orson Hyde & Orson Pratt. I spent A long evening in   conversation with them Elder Hyde wished me to   lay before the Presidency in the valley the situation of  affairs in Pottawatamie county Ioway He wished me   to say to them that all the men of capital were leaving  for the valley men from the East & England that were  able were going to the valley, And all the men that were  living thare that were able to make a fit out were   talking of going Another class who were able to get  a fit out in part even able to get waggons were   taken out by Bishop Hunter so those that are left are  the poorest part of community & if this order of   things is continued A year or two more this county   will be broaken up & the saints will have to scatter  abroad the poor who come from the East & England   who are to poor to go through are left upon our hands  & oxen are now selling in kanesville from $60 to $100  & when this springs Emigration leaves there will  not be left more than one Yoke of oxen to 7 families  & the fields would not be ploughed or planted He  said He did not think that Kanesville & the surrounding  country should be deserted or broaken up but if the  Presidency wished it to be so He should not then   object to it. He spoke upon the subject of opening large  fields & farming upon a big scale by employing the poor  brethren to work upon them this He would like to do if  He could be assured that He would not be called away  in a year or two after commenceing it. He remarked  if the presidency wished to evacuate the place or wished   him to go any whare els He would go. He seemed to   oppose the idea of Having the poor come to Kanesville to  stop He thought they had better cstay in the East or at  St Louis, than to come Here I make this recoorrd to present   to the Presidency according to his request      Elder O. Pratt wished me to say to the Presidency  that there were many Elders in England of power faith  & talent who had to labour hard to get bread for there  families And when Elders were sent to them from   America who had not talent & could not edify them   they felt it was A tax upon them that there own Elders     
 were more capable to Edify them than those that were   sent unto them And when men were sent they should  be such as could Edify & instruct. I spent the night at   Brother Hydes with Elder Pratt 18 miles      May 19, 1850 ~ Sunday      19th [FIGURE] According to appointment I met in conference with   Orson Hyde Orson Pratt And the High Council near the   stand in the grove, one hour before the general meeting   Elder Hyde Addressed the council in substance as follows  That there was business left unfinished at the conference  which must be closed to day As osome officers are going to  the valley others must be appointed. Bishop Johnson was   going Another Bishop must be appointed Also men must be  appointed to visit the various branches who would attend  the council & carry the spirit of the council to the people   & bring back the spirit of the cPeople to the council. Joseph   Young & Benjamin Clapp who were appointed last Year  were not with them at all ieither in Body or spirit &   whenever they did attend A council Joseph Young could   not stay till He went away we will pass them over &   let them go. Elder Hyde also remarked that it was necessa  ry to make arangements to receive the poor that had of   late arived among us I have given council through the  guardian for the poor not to come here & some have   contrary to this councisl through tha misguided zeal councilled   them to come to this place & such must bear the consequen  ces of it. It was voted that A Bishop be appointed to   take the place of Bishop Johnson, & that Elder Stodard   be appointed to travel among the Churches & call such  men to his help as He needed. Three men were Appointed  as A committe to locate the poor.      We then repaired  to the Stand before the congregation & each item of  business was presented before the people the same as   before the council And a vote taken upon each  item Elder Hyde made many remarks upon each item   as they came up before the people Among other things said  that the Priesthood & Saints Held the keys of Blessings  in there own hands & said we have not had but one  shower of rain this year or since last fall & we have  not seen the bow in the Heavens at all this season the  earth is parched up & dry now if you want rain   open your doors & receive the poor And you will have  the Blessings the people said they would do it &  Elder Pratt Prayed for rain. Elder Hyde Also wished   the sin course & evil that arose in that place from the  grog shops should rest upon the Head of those who kept   such dogeries & the people said Amen to it      In the Afternoon Elder O. Pratt Preached to the people  in an Edifying manner spoke Also against the Grog shops   Also of his travel in England the progress of the work in that   land the many thousands who were coming into the   church the great increase of the publications the  opposition that was begining to be manifest against   them spoke of the signs of the times the building     
 of the city of Zion the peculiarity of that city having A   pillar of fire by nigh & a cloud by day resting over  the Habitations of the saints Elder Pratt spoke quite   leangthy upon these points when He closed He was   followed by Elder W. Woodruff who spoke briefly  upon a few item He manifested much pleasure in once   more meeting with the saints said He had been on  a mission to the East nearly two years He could not   give so flattering account of matters as Elder Pratt  Had for the field in the Eastern States had been  like the gleaning of grapes after the vintage was   done thare had been Baptized in his field of   labour about 200 since he had been on his mission. As  there had been much said about the poor coming to kanesville   Elder Woodruff remarked that He had recieved council from  the Presidency in the valley to stretch out his arms and  gather all He possibly could to Zion. And when the Lord tells   me to do any thing or I receive council through the proper   sourse I go at it with all my might And I can neither   eat Drink or sleep in peace except the work that is requ-  ired of him me to be performed is progressing about right   I have laboured hard to gather out the people according to   the instructions given me. One company started from   Philadelphia under Elder Gibson of [blank] I Also started from  Boston on the 9th with 209 And from St Louis with 225   & we arived here in safety & there are a few poor who   came with me who cannot go through & will stop here & if   in my zeal to carry out the instruction of the Presidency I   have been instrumental in causing more poor saints to come   to Kanesville than ought to have come it has been an   Error of the head & not of the heart. I feel to sustain  Elder Hyde in the course He has taken here in taking a stand   against drunkenness gambling stealing Bogasmaking & iniquiti[es]   of all kinds. there is order in the kingdom of God. the   Presidency inof the Church are the first to receive & give instructi[on]   to the whole Church & Elder Hyde is the president in this   place & the one to receive & give instructions & He is accoun[table]  for his course to the Presidency of the Church, other remar[ks]   were made & was followed by Elder Hyde who said that wha[t]   Elder Woodruff had done was all right & would work for good   & other remarks were made He then gave council for the   Brethren who had farms to sell & were thinking of going to the  Valley to take this as an omen that it was right for them [to]   go if they could sell them for what they were worth  to sell them & go if not to stay and till them unless  they felt disposed to give them to some poor brethren      the conference was dismissed & though there had not been  a shower of rain but once since last fall & the bow had   not been seen since last year yet as soon as meeting was   dismissed the clouds gatherd the rain poured down the  Bow appeared And it was a matter of observation with   many of the world as well as Saints. I spent the night at   Elder Hydes

 July 30, 1850 ~ Tuesday      July 30th 1850 [FIGURE}  Our encampment or the first division of it was called  to pass through one of those horrid scenes to day which are  so much dredded by all emigrating companies on the plaines   which was a stampede of all the ox teams with the family   waggons of the first division with the exception of the 10   baggage who were in the rear. No person who has not   experienced or witnessed one of athose dredful scenes cannot   form any correct idea of them and it is almost impossi-  ble to give a correct description of it for to behold 30 or 40   ox teams from 2 to five yoke of oxen in each team attached  to a family waggon of goods & women & children all in   an instant like the twinkling of an eye be deprived of   all reason, sens, & government & be filled with madness   frantic & fright & all dart off with lightning speed each   running their own way, roaring bellowing rolling & tumbling   over each other waggons upsetting smashing their   wheels ex[l]es & tongues spilling the goods women & child  in the street, for the next teams to trample under  their feet as they roar & charge on their way with   their yokes bows & chains flying in evry direction is   a scene not easily imagined or described. A stampede of  ox teams is much more horrid than horse teams as there   is bits in the horses mouth that he may in a great measure  be guided though under full speed, but not so with the   ox. He goes where ever his fancy or will may lead him  This stampede in the folling manner commenced. Willford   commenced getting onto his horse & while getting on  William Murphy started his horse into a run & the horse  flung Wilford over his head onto the ground the saddle turned  under his belly & he run and as he approached one of   the waggons Mr Cannons team became frantic & dart   off with great speed & in a moment 20 or 30 teams  followed the same example and the whole encampment   apparently was rushing into the jaws of Death. I was by   my carriage when it commenced drawn by a noble fine   black steed Rhoda Foss & Susan Woodruff was in the  carriage at the head of the Company. At this moment   I saw Mrs Woodruff rush into the midst of the scene whare  she was in danger of her life evry instant with many  other women & children, I told Rhoda to let the horse run  into the bluffs & do the best she could I hit him a blow   to start him into a run & left them to their chance &   the care of providence & rushed into the midst of the   stampede to try to save the life of my wife & as many  others as possible but I had hard work to save my   own life Mrs Woodruff soon found an opening & fled   out of the midst of it Brother Pettys two waggons was turned  over my family waggon with 4 yoke of oxen ran ove[r] one   of his waggons & a waggon run over one of his children  Brother Badlam waggon or team ran over one of Samuel   Hardys children Prescott Hardy was knocked down by his own  team & badly wounded in the thigh & arm whareever I      
 saw women or children in danger I done what I could  to rescue them little can be done at such times ownly for   each one to dodge the best he can & save his own life if possible  when I found I could do no more for the encampment in  general I run forward to see what state my carriage   & family waggons & family was in I found my noble   horse still a running but on three legs Rhoda was knocked  out of the Carriage & Susan was lying flat upon the  bottom with her feet hanging out between the wheels   & she was screaming aloud. I hollowed for her to   hold on untill I come she did so untill I caught the  horse by the bit & stoped him & rescued her. One of   the ox teams had run onto the horse & carriage had   bent one of [the] ex[l]es smashed one of the horses legs to  peaces & knocked Rhoda out of the carriage. As soon  as I got the horse out of the carriage I went through   the encampment to see who was dead & maimed   and I was asstonished to find that no one was   killed & but one badly wounded & but little damage   done to waggons or oxen and to look it all over it   looked like a miriacle to see how so many escaped  I had to shoot my horse to get him out of his misery   which was painful to me but I was thankful my   wife children & friends were well & their lives preserved      July 31, 1850 ~ Wednesday      31st Elder L Hardy was vary low to day and I am nearly   worn out with hard labour & care we travled 21 miles   & camped on the bank at the crossing of the south fork   of the Platt 20 miles from Ash Hollow      August 1, 1850 ~ Thursday      Aug 1st We forded the Platt River with our teams to day  It was a hard days work it required 8 or 10 yoke of oxen   to draw a ton across the river it was about half a mile  across I got some goods wet.

Here Watts & Bess both smashed each a   hind wheel to peaces & broke evry spoke out I worked  untill eleven oclok at night to get the broken waggon   into camp & then left them by the way side & walked   into Ash Hollow & camped for the night wearied out. 20 m      August 3, 1850 ~ Saturday      3rd the day was spent setting tire & mending waggons      August 4, 1850 ~ Sunday      4th Sunday I spent the day in camp Had a meeting with the   Saints.

 is right. In what way is this to be done by sealing upon   the head of the prophet Joseph those keys to remain in the   Church & kingdom of God untill the winding up scene   the Elders of this Church know those keys were sealed   upon the head of Joseph Smith & still remain in the Church  what are they to accomplish as the saints could not  be perfect in former days with out the Latter day Saints   Neither can we be perfect without our Fathers who have   died for many generations & these keys of Elijah confirmed   upon the president of the church are to seal the fathers to their   children the children to their fathers, & to assist in welding   the great link connecting evry gospel dispensation togeth-  er I see the wheat growing in this dispensation ripening for the  harvest I see the tares also growing for the burning I saw [say] to the   wheat & tares grow on I sawy to the Goats & sheep both to   go ahead unto the End, the Saints of God are increasing   in knowledge fast but they have got to be a hundred times   better, wiser & advance in knowledge befor the end I have  watched the windings & progress of this people & the spirits  that surround them I have seen many arise as it were to   Heaven & in a moment of temptation fall down to Hell and loose   their hop[e]s of glory I know the spirits of men & the invisible   spirits that affect men & operate upon them better than   I do the faces of men I want to speak a little upon natural   philosophy we sow the grain it dies, rots in the ground & then it  brings forth a hundred fold the elements which surrounded   us produce these effects if we had a correct knowledge of the  elements & knew how to control & separate them we could   make bread as well out of the elements as Jesus did when   He fed the multitude. the day will come when we can go [on]   a Journey without taken any food with them would have   power to make it as they went along.

During the pasage of this ordinance many interest  ing remarks were made by the president or Govournor of the state   He says we do not want the church to pass laws to punish crime   ownly to try members on church fellowship if the members shall   transgress the laws of the Land turn them over to the Laws of the   Land but we want to protect the church in their right of   worship & so we will evry other sect that comes here when   the kingdoms of this world become the kingdom of Our Lord &   Savior Jesus Christ will they all be members of the Church   of Jesus Christ & obey the gospel No not one 8th part of them   No more than the Telestial kingdom is a Celestial one and they   stand in about the same relationship one to the other. If a  society of the shaking quakers was to come here & settle in  this valley & wanted a charter to be protected in their worsh-  ip let us give them one & if they believe it right not to marry   a woman let them live without it & not compel them to it  so if the Latter Day Saints wish to have more wives than one   to live holy & raise up holy seed unto the Lord let them enjoy that   privilege Now the Gentile Christian Nations & Legislatores   guard vary strictly against passing any laws to do away with whore-  doms but they will make it almost Death for a man to have two   wives but they will have as many whores as they please yes thou-  sands upon thousands of the Christian Nations are rotting with  the pock & filty corruption & they think this is all right   but for a righteous man to have several wives like Abram  Isaac & Jacob, David & others to raise up a holy seed unto the  Lord & will keep themselves pure before God they think this  is an awful sin but if I had power I would take all   good virtueous females from all wicked corrupt adulterous   husbands & give them to holy men of God that they may raise   up seed unto the Lord I have more wives than one I have many   and I am not ashamed to have it known some deny in the  states that we have more wives than one I never deny it I am   perfectly willing that the people at Washington should know that I   have more than one wife & they are pure before the Lord and   are approved off in his sight I have been commanded of God   to persue this course &c many other interesting remarks were made

 March 2, 1851 ~ Sunday      [FIGURE] March 2nd 1851 Sunday The Assembly was addressed  by P. P. Pratt as a farewell address on his taking his   leave on a foreign mission Among his remarks he   said he had been connected with this church about   twenty one years. He had laboured travled Joyed Sorrowed   felt & experienced with them during that time He had  seen men rise & fall & one thing he wished to speak   off he had seen many of the Sisters in at various times   feel disposed to marry out of the Church & think their is   no harm in it they can marry a Gentile and no harm   in it. But what is the truth in the case it is the same now as anci  ently for instance in the days of Noah the daughters of Noah  married out of the Church in some instances & were not saved   with him in the ark but they & their seed were cut off from  the Earth forever. So with Lot some of his daughters  married Gentiles out of the Church while in Sodom & Gomorrow  and would not go out with their Father Lot but were destroy-  ed they & their posterity from off the Earth so it is with the   Sisters in the Church in this day those who marry out of the  Church marry those who are doomed to destruction & their  posterity while those who are in the Church & are faithful  will live & their children to the last Generation. Brother   Pratt exhorted the Saints to unite in building up the kingdom  of God He felt that their was a good spirit generally prevail-  ing in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints He was   going on a long mission He wanted the prayers of the saints in  his behalf & those who were going with him that they might  save the souls of men & open the gospel to those of other tongues  & languages I think the time has come when it should be done  but I feel that I can do nothing of myself in this matter exc[ept]  the Lord helps me. I feel thankful that I can leave my family   & children here in the midst of the Saints I do not wish   to go to the states to preach the gospel to the nation that has driven  us out if they want the Gospel let them come and ask for it  as we have travled with blistered feet to carriey it to them &  then, then they would curse us for it many other good   remarks were made by Elder Pratt.      President Young addressed the meeting some minutes before   it closed concerning the building of the public works & other things  we met in the upper room for Prayer & had a good time      March 3, 1851 ~ Monday      3rd ^[FIGURE]^ I spent the day in the upper room in council I ordained   one High Priest & one to the Quorum of the Seventies I administered   to 7 others & addressed the saints in the afternoon      March 4, 1851 ~ Tuesday      4th I spent the day at home & made 10 rods of post & board  fence on 1st west Temple street      March 5, 1851 ~ Wednesday      5th I laboured at home Ezra returned at night from the   herd bringing my cattle with him      March 6, 1851 ~ Thursday      6th I drove my oxen to Lorenzo Young herd distance 25      March 7, 1851 ~ Friday      7th I drew 16 dead oxen out of the carell & then returned  home to the city 25

President Young Addressed the meeting in the afternoon  upon the subject of building the Temple, Tithing, & labour on the   public works He said oif evry man was willing to do what  was right their would be no need of Tithing He said he   would not be responsible personally for the labour of any  man on the public works if the people paid their tithing the  workman would get their pay. if we build Temples, public works  or fit out missionaries abroad ior feed the poor it has to be by the  Tithing of the people.

A. Smith & two other Brethren came down to see  us it was a happy meeting Red Creek was a good place   for a settlement      May 10, 1851 ~ Saturday      10th We had another snow storm this morning the snow   fell 8 inches in the valley whare we were which was a great  blessing to the people as it watered their wheat there had  not been such a snow in the valley during the winter  we took breakfast got up our teams & started for Cedar  City we were met by G. A. Smith & a horse company  who came out to escort us in when we arived we were  saluted by the fireing of cannon & the flag of the stars & stripes.  we took up our abode among the Brethren in the fort Brother   Benson & myself stoped with Bishop Robinson we took a     
 a walk to see G. A. Smith saw mill which was up so he could  saw. He informed us they had an abundance of coal, magn[acted]  Iron, Allum salt timber &c nearby we found the Brethren  had done much since their arival they have about 100 men  have been there 3 months. Have enclosed a fort containing 19 acre  & 96 rods of ground and have ploughed & sewed about   1000 acres of wheat have fenced about 6000 acres of land  Have built one saw mill and got a Cooncel House up the 1st  story. This is an important point and probably will be   next to the great salt Lake in importance as they have found  an abundance of coal & Iron      May 11, 1851 ~ Sunday      11th Sunday It was a stormy day Br G. A Smith addressed   the meeting a short time and the people was dismissed      May 12, 1851 ~ Monday      12th A company started out this morning to examine the coal & Iron  the President & council remained in fort to hold a cooncil &  do such business as was necessary. A meeting was called at  4 oclock to ascertain the minds of the Brethren it was found   about 30 wished to go home 15 to get their families & the other  15 to remain at the great salt Lake each one made there excuse  President Young then addressed them & said he would express   his feelings upon the subject to those who wished to go home  If you were now on a mission to France England or any other   part of the Earth preaching the gospel you would not sit down   & council together about going to get your families or go   home untill your mission was ended. this is of quite as   much importance as preaching the gospel for the time has now   come when it is required of us to make the wilderness blos-  som as the rose. Our mission now is build up stakes of Zion   & fill these mountains with cities & when your mission   is ended you are at Liberty to go & be free & ownly do right.  When I go on a mission I leave my affairs in the hands of   God. If my house fields, flocks, wife or children die in my   absence I say Amen to it. If they live & prosper I feel to  say Amen to it & thank the Lord. He wished the Brethren   to finish the fort & secure their grain &c wished the land to  be surveyed so that the Brethren who laid the foundation  could have their choice of farms. He councelled the Brethren  to buy up the Lamanite children as fast as they could &   educate them & teach them the gospel so that not many  generations they would be a white & delightsom people  for the Lord could not have devised a better plan than   to have put us whare we are in order to accomplish this   thing      May 13, 1851 ~ Tuesday      13 The Saints assembled this morning & was addressed by   E. T. Benson in the morning who spoke lengthy in the afternoon  the meeting was addressed By John Young J M Grant &  W Woodruff who expressed their feelings upon various subj-  ects B Young followed and advised to have the logs so close   that arrows could not be shot into the fort. He would prefer to  have many address the saints so as to get Ideas from many than   to have one occupy all the time. He wished the boundaries of the   citieys to be altered on the charter as their was a mistake in also the  name was to be altered from Cedar City to the Indian Name PAROWAN     
 May 14, 1851 ~ Wednesday      14th We rode to Red Creek to see the country we had a feast at   Brother Baylis House of the rich luxeries of Earth.

If we begin right   we shall go right if we begin wrong we shall keep wrong  the United States are afraid of our union & so is the world  In speaking of the Indians he said these Indians were the   descendants of the old gadianton robers who infested these   mountains for more than a thousand years.      we dined together in the city of Parowan & then left   amid the roar of cannon & drove to red creek & camped   for the night. About 30 of the citizens returned with us   to go back to the Great Salt Lake City      May 17, 1851 ~ Saturday      17 we left the valley crossed the mountain & camped on  Beaver creek which abounds with Beaver & trout G.

I rode with Br  Kimball to day all the sick are getting better we camped in  dry valley we found the country filled with the best of   grass for cattle      May 21, 1851 ~ Wednesday      21 We had a rainy morning we rode to the severe crosed it   & nooned the ox teams came up with us & crossed the ferry  also, one waggon turned over in the river we drove to sage Hen creek  & camped for the night I saw about a dozen Beaver play in the swamp at night

I left Brothers Smoot &  Stewart quite sick they were glad to get home I took tea with  Br & Sister Smoot. I then called at Thomas Kingtons Left a   letter went on with the company to the city. An escort of   100 horseman came out to meet us we went into the city   amid the roar of canon I went home to my family & found  them all well and we found on our return the Lord had   given our crops a plenty of rain it had rained 12 days in  succession and the people were blessed. Little Salt Lake  is 250 miles from Great Salt Lake so the whole distance   of our travel to & from was 500 miles      An Eastern mail arived an hour before we did & brought many papers  [FIGURE] 25 And Letters I received 2 letters from I F Carter & one from Foster      May 25, 1851 ~ Sunday      25th ^[FIGURE]^ Sunday The People assembled in the Bowery & filled the  House President B Young addressed the meeting spoke of our  Journey over the mountains & made many interesting remarks  In the afternoon the meeting was addressed By W Woodruff E. T. Benson   and President Young then preached a loud sermon to the people  told them if they went to the merchants as they had done  & run in debt they would soon find themselves slaves to their   enemies & fools told the people to go to making leather & cloth  & the women to card their wool & flak spin their flax & make   cloth & many plain & pointed things were spoken in the evening  we met for Prayer & had a good time      May 26, 1851 ~ Monday      26th In company with Father Woodruff I rode to Thomas   Kingtons & spent the night 10 m      May 27, 1851 ~ Tuesday      27th I went to fishing & caught 49 trout spent the night to Br Kingtons      May 28, 1851 ~ Wednesday      28th I returned home 10      May 29, 1851 ~ Thursday      29th I spent the day at home choreing      May 30, 1851 ~ Friday      30th I spent the day hunting a lost cow rode 15 mils      May 31, 1851 ~ Saturday      31st [FIGURES] I received a letter from Ilus F Carter conta-  ining an Invoice of goods sent by Mr Monroe I wrote  him one letter containing one sheet & a half giving him   what News I could      June 1, 1851 ~ Sunday      June 1st 1851 Sunday when I arived at meeting President   Young was speaking & the following is a synopsis of his  discourse "If a man does right he shall have the spirit of God   to enlighten his mind in all things yet all men will be   tryed, buffeted, & tempted more or less in this probation & he  that governs himself is wise. If a man is unrighteously   angry he should let it sleep & not show itself untill he is right  again. good men may be left to commit a gross sin but  if he had watched closely he would have escaped the evil. the  Lord intends all men to be tryed in this life & if you build     
 your faith upon a true foundation that faith has got to be tryed   All men have an oppertunity of appearing wise or foolish   of governing themselves or making their folley manifest   Peter commit a gross error had he have been on the watch  tower he might have turned away in silence & not denyed his   Lord. Many have been tryed & turned away from us   at a time when they expected to have gained sumthing by &  in doing so they have lost all. Others have been blinded &   overcome & done evil then their eyes were open to see the conseq-  uences. But it is the privilege of all men to live so that they   can see what each act will amount to either good or evil How   different the prospect would be before the world or this people if  they would live so from what it now is. I endeavour to do right   in all things & then leave the event in the hands of God & am satisfy   with the result. If a man is led or tempted to do a thing that you do  not comprehend the result of & that result ^not^ lead to good then let it  alone.      During the past week one remarked to me that my observat-  ions last sunday ought to be observed & was good but it ought to have   been spoken in the right spirit. But I wish to say that I am   satisfyed with the power & influence the Lord has given me. The Lord   directs things according to his own will, I know my feelings & zeal   would make my words like a sharp two edged sword so that they   would seperate the sins from this people that they should practice   sin no more not be tempted with it but this is not the will   of God the people still must have their warfare & trial & if the  storms & waves overwhelm the ship still all is well for we have  a good captain at the helm. Some people are vary anxious  to reprove others while they are wrong themselves and do not know  the spirit they are of theiry are ready to say How do you   do Peter & Judas Jesus, & How do you do Mr Devil And are   vary pious but will go to Hell with their spirit & the whole   world will go to Hell with the same spirit Awake ye Elders   of Israel & make your calling & election sure lest you go to   Hell with the wicked, I do not point you to the sectarian   Hell whare Devils are tosting you with a pitchfork in the   billows of Hell fire eternally. But go & mingle with the wicked  in the states wrangle & fight with them get their spirit   & feelings & loose the light & spirit of God & you will begin   to feel the true state of the Damned. The wicked killed   Jesus Christ out of mallace & wickedness & they did not   know that His death was to save the world the Lord turns  many things for good which the world means for Evil the  whole Earth is filled with misery, sin & wickedness I   could find no worse Hell than to be confined among them  I labour for the welfare of this whole people I wish my   Brethren to be a happy free people that their course of  life may be such as to get an Eternal & temperal salvation   I labour to effect this, their is time & change to all things   Their has been a code of Laws given in former days  which was for all people which is the gospel of Jesus Christ   In the dasyys of Christ the Apostles & Elders were sent out  to preach the gospel & warn the people they did so but were   then martered for preaching it & the saints were killed off  the Earth, that time is gone the change has come, for now     
 wisdom & ingenuety in temperal things true friendship is  not known on the Earth if it is not among this people But the   friendship of this people is the fruits of the gospel of Jesus Christ  this must continue to improve untill they are perfect      In speaking upon the subject of tithing the President thought  their had not Been $200 dollars paid in cash during the   past Year inby this people in tithing but they have paid the   merchants $200000 in cash, & their is now 30000 bushels   of wheat due on tithing. Shall we dispens with the Law of   Tithing. Dont you want a building to meet in to worship God   we want a Tabernacle, & a Temple for our Endowments   also a Tower to hang a bell on & we want to keep building  up Zion that Israel may have a place of rest. if we do this  we do our duty we have duties to perform and a warfare  to accomplish but the victory will soon be ours the greatest   warfare is with ourselves if we can gain a victory with   ourselves so as to have peace with ourselves our wives & childn   we shall do well. many other interesting remarks were   made by the president.       In the afternoon the meeting was addressed by O Spencer   in an adifying manner. And was followed by Elder   Kimball who spoke much to the edifycation of the people   we had our prayer meeting in the evening & was in  council untill 10 oclok      June 2, 1851 ~ Monday      2nd June I spent the day at home      June 3, 1851 ~ Tuesday      3, I went to  porters Mill & got a load of Lumber &   caught 15 trout      June 4, 1851 ~ Wednesday      4th I went to see my herd of oxen that was brought down      June 5, 1851 ~ Thursday to June 7, 1851 ~ Saturday      5th 6th 7th I spent the time about my labour      June 8, 1851 ~ Sunday      8th Sunday President Young addressed a full assembly of  the Saints as follows. I want to speak such things as are   in my heart. All that are acquainted with me know that my  religion embraces all things that belong to the duties of life   The Religion I have embraces all the principles of present   future, progressive & Eternal Salvation in evry sens of the   word. I labour for the salvation of myself & my Brethren I would   be glad to speak to thousands even the whole world if they could   hear I would not like to preach in this house to 20 or 100 persons  when more than 1000 could get in here then for 20 or 1100 more come   & have to preach 20 or 50 times to have the people learn when   they could learn it all at once. The President of the Seventies   called a separate meeting to day I come & dismissed it what if the   Twelve Seventies High Priest, Elders, priest, Teachers, Deacon & member  should do the same there would be bear walls for the house to   preach to & what Good would it do. If the presidency of the seventies  have such important things to lay before the quorum as to get them to  -gether on sunday let them come & teach us all. I now want to   give council in this matter from this time forth & forever let   not the president of any quorum ever again call a separate meeting   from the public congregation unless the president of the Church [order]  it. The seventies should be here and all the people should be here   let the seventies Hall go & all other business when Sunday comes     
 let the Saints of God come together & hear the Elders teach  Apply your hearts unto wisdom & get it. If I am full of   the spirit of God I shall not get any more than I want   It is the duty of all to come here that can come & let the   power of Eternity rest upon us and you should not be asleep   but wide awake. When I contrast the present with the past   situations of the Saints I[t] gives me a great variety of feelings,  both good & bad Joyful & sorrowful I have seen this  people waiding through a school of affliction they then   were prayful & had faith their trying situation made   them remember the Lord their God. But now prosperity   is heaped upon you and as this people are to be tryed in all   things when prosperity comes some forget God wax fat   & rich do not realize the blessings they are enjoying. some   who are in poverty abroad desire to gather with the saints   when they arive & get rich they forget what they have   been. Could you see the feelings of thousands now   who are abroad who desire with all their hearts to come   here they would be willing to lick up the dust of your feet   if they could but be here they still are with the wicked   Bring them here they look upon many who were poor   but now rich, they then desire to be rich also they want   gold & will soon be willing to sacrifice the society of the   Saints & go to the gold mines & plunge themselves again  into Hell as it were from whare they came to gratify an   unlawful desire thus it is with many men some were   to go to the plat to Bear River & keep a ferry to get gold   & wait on wicked ungodly men to get gold whare are   their minds like the fools eyes. I told them I would   not wait on the devils for loads of gold I would rather  stay here & serve the Lord. All I want of property is  to serve the Lord & build up his kingdom with it. I suppose   many of the Brethren & Sisters are much tryed to think   they cannot have all they want. I will tell you what   to do, do all you can to day & let the rest go untill to morrow   do your duty to day and all will be right what   good would it do you to have 999 years to search & hear the revelations   & commandments of God if we have no time to carry one of   them out. If any one wants to get more revelations than they   improve upon they are greedy dogs. It will take 20 years to do the   work that God has revealed through the mouth of his servant   Joseph which he laid out for us to perform before his death   even during the last year of his life to say nothing of what he   gave before. I will tell you your duty. Command your minds  from evry thing that is not for you to day & sit & worship God   not sit & sleep but worship the Lord today, go home at the close   of the meeting & get your food & rest then come to meeting again  ponder & reflect upon the cause of the Lord Jesus Christ & his sufferi-  ngs. if their is any thing necessary to be done do it if an ox or an   ass falls into the pit pull him out, drive any beast out of your Neigh  bors grain & put up the fence. Do you meditate do you pray in   your families & in secret to get the spirit of God. you say you  have my ^your^ tryials I have mine I will tell some of them Brethren will   come here to meeting on Monday morning go through my field leave   my fence down let their cattle & horses eat my wheat     
 Borrow my cart waggon, shovel, hoe, ax & evry thing I have  got & that to without liberty & never bring it home and if   it was not my duty to stay here I would lay my hands   upon some I could pick out who I have confidence in &  would go & form a colony by myself & would not admit  of any person who was not proven I cannot get grass in the  Big field but many of you do it. But I now warn you not to   steal my wood nor any of my property for if you continue   to do it I will put a mark upon such men that they will  carry all the days of their lives they are hypocritts and   think all others are the same I dont love them vary well  Again I say to you it is not your duty to get in debt to these  Merchants I say you shall pay your debts if you say you cant  pay I say you shall pay them.      I speak of the faults of my   Brethren you may ask shall we forgive our Brother his trespas  if he repents I say yes "How many times untill seventy times seven  in one day if he repents & asks for it even all sins except  the sin agains[t] the Holy Ghost. If you will bring back my tools  grass & grain which you have taken unlawfully or any of my property  and ask forgiveness I will return forgive you I will not cast  of[f] any man untill he cast himself off I will not reject any   man untill he rejects himself, I will hold on to any man as long  as he has any prospect of salvation.      June 9, 1851 ~ Monday to June 14, 1851 ~ Saturday      9th 10th 11th 12 13th & 14 This week has been spent in hunting lost  cattle, wattering wheat & common labour      June 15, 1851 ~ Sunday      15th Sunday President Brigham Young addressed the congrega-  tion of the Saints in the following words.      I would like to say enough in few words to fill three sermons  I have had to deliver my discourses in few words. I wish the  people to sustain the priesthood as the priesthood. As to the opin-  ion of men concerning myself as a man I care no more about  it than I do the dust under my feet. I dont care what you   say about me If you will ownly serve the Lord our God do the people  live so as to know the voice of the Good shepherd. I wish to state  one item here which concerns you seriously, that is concerning  the Indians here. They are Ignorant have been taught to steel   & kill from their childhood & those who could do the most of it were  considerd the greatest Braves & chiefs as soon as they begin to steal   here many of you want them killed compare their circumsta  nces with your own. You are taught from your cradles not to  steal or kill as it is a great crime now do you kill a white man  as soon as he steals weigh this subject well. Those who wish  them killed for stealing a horse reduce themselves far below the  Indian. You love them as well as I do, but when the curse  is taken off they will again be fit for society but while they   are in their degraded state it rests upon us to use wisdom &   judgment in their behalf. I say to the saints kill evry white   man you see stealing & not kill the Indian for it for the white men   know better. I speak to the saints not as the Govornor of Utah but you  & I are sent to save Israel not to kill them. Evry Elder that croses  a certain line I do not wish to see him but those who do right or  seek to do right if they commit an error we will forgive them  I do not ask for influence ownly what God gives me neither will  I give any man influence ownly what the Lord & his own good     
 conduct gives him for if God does not give a man influence  all els will be of no use to him. If I do the work of God i all is   well but I will give no man influence ownly what God gives  A Few words to families who have not a head to Govern  will be destroyed. The man is the head of the family & should  govern it. the hand may say to the head if I really thought you  would govern right I would be governed by you but I am afraid  you will not and I want to govern you & dictate the head then the  shoulders & stomach will want to dictate but does not good sens teach  you that your head should Govern your body your experience teaches  the same. Your head dictates you what to do & when your head   dictates the body to do wickedly & pollute the body then the head  should be cut off so as not to pollute the body any longer      G A Smith remarked that there was some bodies who could not  act unless the belly told the head what to do. In the strict sens of  the word no man is qualifyed to be jud[g]e & rule in the priesthood   untill he is qualifyed to rule himself, & be king over himself  it is thus in families children & mothers Have you a good  Husband & Father let the wife rule the Husband & she will keep  him tied to the dish cloth & kitchen all the days of his life & it  proves a curse upon him. Their is a curse upon man that   I would not take off if I could for in the experience you  have you are led to salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ      Do you know your calling Mothers It is your duty to brace up  your feelings as men have to do & be mystress of your house  I go to the house to rest the Mother sayes I cannot govern the  children I wish you would but this is not right the Elders  of this church have to go abroad to preach the gospel they  cannot be with their children when they come home to  spend a little time they want to daudle their children upon  their knee & not go to whiping them the Mother should go[vern]  them wuntill the sons go with their Fathers in the field then  let the Father Govern I can govern my children when   they are with me I would rather one of my sons would  stab me to the heart & kill me dead than to conquer &   master me in government when any undertake to   govern out of their place they do not prosper. As an ensample  P P Pratt & John Taylor undertook to govern & controll &  set right my affairs at winter Quarters while I was on   a pioneer Journey to the Mountains & they liked to have destro  yed many but I said peace be still and I saved the people  I say to Mothers in the Name of the Lord God of Israel do your   duty dont ask the Father to whip the child do it yourself if   necessary & let Mothers controll their daughters untill they go  to their Husbands, but let the Man rule & preside over his household  and I say to the Men do not go home & abuse your wives becaus  of what I have said but treat them kindly what would  you think of a man who would get up before a glass &  cut & tear his own heart out as well of him as I would   of a man who would beat & abuse his wife.       President Richards remarked Evry man makes his own Hell or Heaven  if we keep the commandments & do right we have a Heaven within  us all the time 40 Men & all the devils in Hell cannot make a Hell for us if  [we] do right but if you stop to parley with the devil he will soon get the advantage  over you & make a Hell for you     
 [FIGURE] During the evening we met for prayer after which the president   taught us much to our edifycation. The spirit should controll the  body the monitor whispers to the mind of man when it does [wrog] wrong  & sayes this is wrong points out the right path & sayes walk ye in it  the soul or spirit of man wants feeding as well as the body or it   will dry up & wither like the quakers & other sects      A Mormon boy will whip out the priest we will advance untill we  can stand in the society of the gods, then let us do right & keep the  commandments of God in all things. Our knowledge comes by experi[ence]  it is Necessary that we should have crosses & trials of all kinds   in order to gain knowledge by experience if we overcome we   get a great victory continue to do so untill we arive at our high   stations to become Gods Organize worlds & controle them. All  our passions God gave us but we must controll them & make a  right use of them. Our spirits were pure from Eternity but   condescended to take a body in its impure state was married   to it will continue with it through time in mortality through   Eternity in Immortality. In speaking of the married state  sayes if man & wife become alliniated from each other it is  in one sens the spirit of adultery      June 16, 1851 ~ Monday to June 21, 1851 ~ Saturday      16th 17, 18, 19, 20 & 21, this week was spent hunting lost  cattle & at hard labour      June 22, 1851 ~ Sunday      22nd Sunday President Young addressed the saints as   follows. If I can see the motives of the heart of man & know   Eternal things by the spirit of God it is far more beautiful   than to hear their words of men. should an Angel come  & convers with any man in the congregation No other one might  know it. He would think the person spoke to him as one speaks to  another face to face when he would not be seen at all ownly by  the spirit of God or by vision. we may know by the spirit of  God what is in a mans heart before he speaks, at all times listen   to the still small voice of the spirit of God and it will save the saints  from many snares. If you get angry dont sin nor let the sun  go down upon your wrath I do not expect perfection in men   not what the world calls perfection I have seen a perfect prophet  and perfect Apostles, that is perfect in their calling. But not the  perfection the world looks for. If Joseph had been as perfect as  the people wished him to be he could not have lived with the people  nor stayed this side of the veil as long as he did, we co[u]ld not have  herd his voice nor seen his face. He would have had to been veiled  Israel could not endure the face of Moses at times. The Lord exp-  ects us to be in the path of Duty when we get in Eternity we  shall be Angels or Goods we shall their advance to the God head   if we do right.      In speaking of the Law what a simple thing it is  what is the Law to those who do right. It is not made for any  body but the transgresser & lawless & wicked. If we do not infringe  upon the rights of others all things are ours in Heaven & Earth time  & Eternity Life & Death Heaven Earth & Hell & all that is therein  is ours if we do not infringe upon the rights of any other being  we shall become Gods & fill immensity as our Father in Heaven  does I can weigh all the sleepers philosophers, & Learned men  of the Earth in the scale & know just what they weigh & can cir  cumscribe them all. All is mine Heaven Earth, Hell wives children     
 and I am Christs & Christ is Gods. It is not known to us whare  the stakes are set to Gods immensity. Take the world at large and  they get to the end of their chain when they get to the mill   pond. It is a startling Idea to think we are worshiping a God   that once was once in the situation that we are in ourselves  they had to pass through a probation of pain, suffering & the fall  like ourselves & He made perfect through sufferings. The Son of  God passed through it & the Father would not require of a son   what He would not do Himself. All our sufferings will exhalt  us in the presence of God if we endure them patiently. A word of  advice concerning lawing I dont never want to hear of another  law suit among the Brethren. Is it anything but good common  sense to Never have another suit before a jud[g]e to say nothing  of revelation. It does not require any great perfection to   accomplish this, let men do right do your Neighbour good not  evil. The Lord will burn up the Earth to cleanse it as you would  an old pipe. You think it hard to have to water your land here  but it is far more healthy than to have rain it was so in Egypt if  it did not rain in Illinois & Missouri more than here it would  be far more healthy this could be reasoned out on Natural   principles. A word more upon Law suits their would not be a Lawsuit  in this valley if all men would do right & were saints but the net has  gathered all kinds good bad & worse let twelve men get drunk  in this community & it ruins the place in the estimation of  of good men we have to bear the character of the drunkard  a few stinking fish in the net defile it. & the whole net stinks  and it creates a prejudic against it. Those who were acq-  uainted with Joseph know that if he delt any in temporal   things it created a prejudice against him. He bought many  goods to help carry on the public works but the people were ready  to get it all away from him. So it is now but I say unto   all men who are saints put to your hands & help build up Zion  & the Kingdom of God we are scholars in the great school & must   learn we are a kingdom & must bring the kingdom in subje[c]tion  to the will of God      June 23, 1851 ~ Monday to June 28, 1851 ~ Saturday      23rd 24th 25, 26, 27 ^& 28^ This week was spent in prepareing to build      June 29, 1851 ~ Sunday      289th Sunday President Young remarked I Join in testimony   with the Brethren I wish to be a doer of the word I feel the import  ance of the remarks of the last speaker Brother Spencer those  who are not ready to meet the Bridegroom will not be invited   to the supper and the time is near. Jesus Christ is an ensam-  ple to all Saints, He was filled with wisdom in his youth but in  his childhood & infancy He was like other children. It has   been said that He was in infancy wise as in manhood but this  is not the case He was subject to temptation as we are but was  not overcome by it. If we have become acquainted with our follies  let us put them away & apply our hearts unto wisdom. let us have   compassion on others as we wish God to have compassion   on us we should increase in wisdom untill the day of redemption  No person can receive all at once but increase little by little untill  the day of perfection. Apply our hearts to wisdom & it will produce  peace, health, wealth & evry good thing. should you see a people  carry out the principles of wisdom peace would be the fruit &     
 you would never see contention unto the day of your death  Ask the world if they do not like a people who live in peace & are   contented & they will say yes it is beautiful take the world at   the present time & they are like wolves eat each other up they   fight & contend & devour each other the abolitionest become heated   & say the Negro must be made equal to the white man at the table &  all other places they will at the same time turn away the widow &   orphan & put into prision a poor man for debt, and deprive him  of his time to pay the debt, instead of this we should feed the   hungry & do good to all men as we have an opportunity   then we have a Zion it is peace in the heart we should   bear an evil from a Friend as well as an Enemy you ask the   Lord to bear with your infirmities so we should bear with   each other. what is the necessity of doing wrong having law  suits & contending with each other go to Law & spend $100 to  collect $5. you may be told you are independent & have rights   you have a right to do good & not evil. The God I serve will   deal out good to his saints & evry thing that is necessary   for them & reveal his will unto them, & teach them what   to do He will not lie or decieve me I will ask O Lord   did you do this or that did you bless this man or that man   so & so or did you suffer that evil to be so & so yes I   have done this to try men so & so, do you want me to do   so & so. If I am going to do a thing I ask is it the will of   God if I cannot get the will of God upon it I refuse to  do it lest I do a thing wrong, we want to do right then we   prosper. is the people doing right is the kingdom growing  is their principles in this kingdom to govern all men with   All that the Nations of the Earth Now possess would not make   this people happy as they now are. Give us the kingdom of God   instead of the glories of the world. their has been a great stir to   exhalt the Negro & make him equal to the white man but   there is a curse upon the seed of Cain & all Hell cannot wipe   it out & it cannot be taken off untill God takes if off   when a person unlawfully seeks for power & exhaltation   by taking the blessings which belongs to another he will   sink far below the other. As Lucipher the son of the morning  sought the glory that belonged to Christ the first born   He was thrust down to Hell. so Cain sought Abels blessi-  ng & took the life of his brother the consequence was   Cain was cursed & his seed & this curse will remain   untill Abels posterity will get all the blessing their is   for him then the curse may be taken from Cain or   his posterity but his posterity will be below Abels. All  are slaves Polititions are the worst slaves and if we dont  do right we shall ketch the lash we are the freest   people on Earth. Queen Victoria is a slave had to ask   the liberty to marry prince Albert but we are free we have   the right God & kingdom let isus not dishonor God His kingdom   or our Brethren if we do we shall sink below them & their   children. If the wife dishonors the Husband the children  will dishonor the Mother & she must welter under it   Honour the priesthood in all its parts. Be more faithful be   more prudent. Administer to the wants of all as far as you   can I will not quarrel with my neighbor about the water     
 if I loose the wheel for if my Neighbors raises wheat I   can obtain some of it to eat. Other remarks were maid by  the speaker      July 1, 1851 ~ Tuesday      July 1st I commenced laying adobies in my house this day      July 2, 1851 ~ Wednesday to July 3, 1851 ~ Thursday      2 & 3 We continued building the house      July 4, 1851 ~ Friday      July 4th In celebration of the Independance of America   the City of the great Salt Lake poured forth her inhabitants who   went forth in good order with her Legion of mighty men   As an Escort to the Govornor & citizens of the state. The company   organized at the Temple square & started at 9 oclok in the   morning to take a ride to the great Salt Lake their was about   140 carriages of waggons besides the Horsemen the car   containing the Band of Musicions was drawn by 16 mules we   arived at the rock on the Lake at 2 oclock A.M [p.m.] we had   a meeting was addressed by Govornor Young & several   Orators who spoke much to the edifycation of the people in   the evening many went into the salt lake to bathe at 10 oclk  the signal was given for prayers when all assembled in   the carrell or circle and prayer was offered up before   God & the encampment retired to rest we were 24 miles   from the city      July 5, 1851 ~ Saturday      5th At 10 oclok AM all the teams were hitched up &   we returned to the City of the Great Salt Lake in the same   Order that we came out. It was as plesant a forth of   July as I ever spent my own family & Sister Foss & her   family went out together in a large family waggon   drawn by 4 Horses      July 6, 1851 ~ Sunday      Sunday 6th President Young remarked we get good   from all men who speak by the spirit of God & according to their   calling I speak free so may all men. If we speak   incorrect we should be corrected we want to speak free that   we may gather good whether it is in the past present or to   come Brother Kempton has been speaking. He professes to   be a scholar I do not, but he has murdered the English language   today I want speakers to speak the English language correctly   for our children sake. As to principles their is no principles   in Heaven Earth or Hell but what the Saints have to appley to   their proper place. If we could understand all things we  should know that here is the place to begin to make the people happy  if we could understand the dealings & providences of God   with us & the object of it their would not be the discontent   & murmerings of the people that their now is but we should   have peace Joy & contentment. Concerning spiritual   & temporal things I would say that temporal & spiritual   things are one but what we call temporal are the courser   things which we see with our Eyes but the finer or spiritual   things we cannot see with our Eyes unless they are touched   by the spirit of God. Then we could see spiritual things  to say the spiritual eye cannot see temporal things is folly  but it looks unnatural to see people put out their own eyes to   spite their Neighbor. Anciently God Angels & Eternal things     
 were considered Natural my mind can see many things when  clothed with the spirit of God that my Eyes cannot. In  speaking of Hell it is called vary hot but our God is  a consumeing fire. Hell is here it is said the devil was   cast down to the Earth also that he was cast down to Hell  He is in our midst striveing to lead captive the children  of men I want the Brethren to speak freely to speak  all that is in you & if you have an Error let it out  & exchange it for true principle. some of the Saints   want more Revelation mysteries, great things, but do they know what   they ask for or what they have already got if the request of many men   was granted it would be like casting pearles before swine they would  trample them in the mire we have enough now of the key words &  tokens to take us through the veil into the celestial world & lead us to the  Throne of God, & what more do you want. Have you ever pondered in   your hearts by visions & the spirit of God Eternal things even the redeeming of  all worlds from there down to the smallest things God has made Have   you ever reflected upon the great system of salvation of the creatures   of God Is man contented He is not. Can man alter the decrees of  God concerning the seed of Abraham or any thing els He cannot  why not quarrel about Christ coming instead of the Father  when the Father appointed Jesus Christ the first born to come &   redeem the Earth there was contention got up the second brother  Lucipher the son of the morning He wanted the honour to come & redeem   the Earth but Christ was the Appointed one it was his right by appoin  tment & birthright. But the war & contention became so hot & the   influence of Lucipher was so great that he got one third of the hosts  of Heaven to Join his standard & when he was hurled down to Hell  like lightning from Heaven one third was cast down with him whare  is he & those that were cast down, with those spirts that accompanied  him they are here on this Earth and they have blinded the child  ren of men & still seeking to overthrow the kingdom of God  He is a thorn in the flesh to the children of God but this is all right  & we should be contented with what God sees fit to grant unto us & to  contented with our lot. If the devil had been contented & acted in   his place he would not have been thrust down to Hell. Any man who  seeks to do a thing that he cannot do & should not do it cast him   into Hell & makes a Hell for him when men ask for things that   does not belong to him & it makes him unhappy. But do what   God wants you to do & wait on those who are above you & all   will be right. why did not one of the Apostles quarrel with   Jesus Christ to redeem the world Jesus set a little child in   their midst & said if ye do not become as this little child you   cannot enter into the kingdom of God. If you would be the   greatest man in the kingdom of God you must be the greatest slave   or servant you will do more than any other man. The Apostles   did not quarrel to know who should or should not be president  why do I or you not quarrel because we were not Joseph Smith  to want to & cannot is Hell. Never seek to do a thing you cannot   accomplish. Evry man has his lot appointed him & he should be   contented with it. Their is the work of God, Angels, men & Devils   Is the Bible good the Book of Mormon Doctrins & Covenants  yes they are good those Book contain the words of God Angels men  & Devils. And if you dont want to be in Hell all the time be contented  with your lot if you dont learn to be contented you will be in   Hell with Brother Kempton who sayes he was in Hell one year     
 then learn to be contented and you will be happy dont complain   because you are not God, Jesus Christ, an Angel, Joseph, Brigham  a man, a woman a Father a Mother, a son a daughter or   any thing els but be contented with the lot in which God has  placed you then you will be happy & blessed. The Blacks cannot   take the curse off themselves untill God takes it off make all   men saints & they will treat each other well. So the Laman-  ites are cursed but is there not blessings for them yes the same   as their is for the Saints for Joseph Brigham & Jesus Christ  & all Faithful men & women in their time & season so be contented      July 7, 1851 ~ Monday to July 12, 1851 ~ Saturday      7th 8th  9th 10th 11 & 12 This week was spent in building my house  except Monday the 7th I spent in the council House with my   Brethren labouring in the duties of my office      July 13, 1851 ~ Sunday      13th Sunday met as usual at the Bowery. Elder Sherwood preached  in the forenoon a lengthy discourse which was edifying to the people  In the afternoon Elder Kimball Father Smith E D Woolley &   President Young spoke. Among the Presidents remarks he said  why should we not know our own talents & abilities as well   as others if we do not their is sumthing lacking. concerning singing  theire isare some men who know sound & others do not & those   who do not know sound ought not to sing, we should act   upon what we do know & let the rest go Sherwood said he   thought we were kicked out of the fire into the frying pan  President Young said we were kicked out of the fire into   the middle of the floor when this people get their eyes  open so as to see that their interest lies in building up   of the kingdom of God then the kingdom of God will roll on   and the people will do better      July 14, 1851 ~ Monday      14th I spent the day in the council chambers with my   Brethren I herd two interesting letters read from our   Friend & Brother Col Kane of Philadelphia. Kinkade had  a large train of goods arive to day      July 15, 1851 ~ Tuesday      15 some of the government officers & their train arived   to day      July 16, 1851 ~ Wednesday to July 19, 1851 ~ Saturday      16, 17, 18 & 19 I spent the time building my house  Bulah Augusta born this 19, July 1851      July 20, 1851 ~ Sunday      20th Brother Kempton was vary anxious to preached   from text Abrams bosom liberty was granted him   and he went ahead but did not do much President Young   followed & said Brother Kempton has had his liberty  as is given to evry man who speaks here he has not satisfyed  his mind at all he may have much in his mind but can   say but little here. He is not able to handle the scriptures & know  all the spirits in the world as some can when the dark sayings  in the scriptures are understood they are plain. The scripture  here that speaks of Abrams bosom is not as given by Br   Kempton Abram is in paradise Lazarus is with him [##Luke 16:20-25##]  for me to explain is to tell the truth a man that feels &   talks to the people should be a Bible of himsel if a man that     
 teaches & leads the people is not filled with truth so as to be able to   teach the people without quoting the teachings of others altogether is  a blind guide & will go to Hell with those he leads. It is the intenti-  on of the Lord to teach men principle in progression untill he   shall know all things, that he may arise through faith power  & victory untill they obtain evry good thing even to arise   to be Gods even the Sons of God which blessing we cannot  obtain without experience we should not sin when we are   tryed & tempted but overcome which will give us glory   honor & eternal life as fast as I improve upon what I have  more will be given me. The Saviour was subject to all that we were   from his birth to his death. He applyed his heart unto wisdom  we should do so to apply our hearts unto wisdom from day to   day and you will receive all that He did. If I through out   all that is in me what faults I have will give place for truth   & that is good I feel to praise the Name of God for all   He has done for me. My heart is like Aminidab continually  all persons see times when they wish truth to prevail. Mormonism  is all theruth the Lord has raised up a Prophet & Seer who brought  it forth & esstablished it. He was faithful unto death & sealed   his testimony with his blood. A certain prophecy sayes when   the Book of Mormon shall come unto the gentile the Jews shall   be gathered at Jerrusalem. All truth is ours in Heaven Earth  & Hell it is all the truth we want. But does the church or Elders   want correcting yes for they have errors & fals botions the net   has all kinds of fish we have some as cursed rascals among   us as dwell on the Earth and we find Evil here as well as any   whare els. Yet Zion is here it is in my heart peace dwells   with me & good principles will prevail Here untill all evil  is overcome even in all the Earth let no man find fault with   his Neighbor untill He is righteous I dont ask any thing of  others that I wont do myself and never find fault with   another about any thing you allow in yourself dont you  sware, scold, & do wrong yourself then dont find fault  with another for it untill you subdue your own passions   & the Evil that is in yourself some will do any thing  to preside over another when they cannot preside over   themselves. Now remember this that we will have Zion   when all wickedness is gone. we have got to fight fight  fight untill we gain the victory over ourselves. Remember   this & overcome what is the feelings of my heart it is to bless  the people & do them good      July 21, 1851 ~ Monday to July 23, 1851 ~ Wednesday      21, 22 & 23rd spent the time on my house      July 24, 1851 ~ Thursday      JULY 24th  [FIGURE] This is an important day with the saints   of God in thes vallies of the mountains   The following is an extract from the Deseret News      "The celebration of the 24 of July" The Anniversary of the enter-  ance of the Latter Day Saints Pioneers into the valley of the Great  Salt Lake. The approach of the rising king of Day was hailed   by the roar of cannon & the stillness of the morning was broaken   by the moveing of the mammoth carriage of the Nauvoo Brass Band   sending forth on the wings of the morning its sublime straines   of martial & cheering music & the citizens of Great Salt Lake     
 shot forth from their domestic circles dressed as in the robes of   beauty concentrating towards the scene of a congregated throng   of life whare the ebullitions of Joy the rose of Health the glaness  of intelligence & the combined feelings of an united & redeemed   people shed a lustre of glory through all the congregated Saints      "The order of the day was kept up by the fireing of cannon 110   times the organization & parading of streets by an escort consisting   of the Nauvoo Brass band the Military Band the Pioneers of  47 the Regency, the aged Fathers, young lads, followed by   the Mothers in Israel young girls, young men & young women   the Presidency with the officers of State formed the escorted  party in their rear were 24 Bishops forming a phalanx of   the combined wisdom & strength of the Kingdom of God in the last  days the numerous flags & banners the various emblems of art   agriculture, & industry & the music accompanying the procession from  the presidence residence to the Bowery could ownly be surpassed   in the Armies of heaven      The bursts of feelings by music, singing, speeches, orations, toasts  the order of arangement during the exercises in the Bowery was beyond   the most exquisite calculation of the most fastidious & was unsur-  passed by any preceding it among the most refined & civilized   nation on Earth. Here was the power of truth the literature   of Gods spirit, the Eloquence of Apostles, the laws of the kingdom   of Heaven, the songs of Zion sung not in a strange land & the   harps hung not upon the willows the beauty & ornament of the   beau ideal of mans existence the ladies of Deseret the Heroism   of the valiant of the Earth & the Enjoyment of the luxuries and   productions of a consecrated land in all its richness &   profusion & the enjoyment of contentment      The closing shades of evening came over the city without the   alloy of any accident to mar the procedings of the hallowed day  no curses of a drinking rabble no feelings of an ignorant or   Jealous bigotry, no effusion of party strife but all that could   elevate the mind of man & add to the enjoyment of a social  & civilized.      Among the speeches made was an interesting one  from W W. Phelps      In many respects this was the most interesting day of my   life. My Father, myself, & my children making three   generations in the linage of my Fathers was in that Grand   Escort to Honor the Holy Prophets of God while on their   march from President Youngs House to the Tabernacle which   was filled with the Saints of the Most High      July 25, 1851 ~ Friday to July 26, 1851 ~ Saturday      25 & 26 I spent the time about my dwelling      July 27, 1851 ~ Sunday      27th Sunday I attended meeting we had a good day. Brother   Kimball addressed the meeting a part of the day among other remarks  He said Jesus Christ was the first Born of the Father & He was   the candidate & elected to redeem the world. Lucipher set  up as a candidate to run against Jesus Christ but He was overcome   & thrust down to Hell with all that followed him and we will have  no more division henceforth & forever in Israel we will have but one   candidate for office but No opposition. All will be elected &   proven. If a person is qualifyed to fill a greater station than he holds     
 He will have a chance. The Presidency & Twelve will fill in Eternity   those stations appointed them so with all men but I expect to   remain on this Earth untill I am able to create a world of my   own & people it the lord has given us rich portions of the Earth  to inherit we have been driven from tim to time from there  we now inherit a goodly land the best land on the Earth for  vegitation & it will be good for fruit & the people of the Earth  will yet come to us for fruit      July 28, 1851 ~ Monday to July 31, 1851 ~ Thursday      28, 29, 30, 31 I spent in my Harvest field      August 1, 1851 ~ Friday to August 2, 1851 ~ Saturday      Aug 1st & 2nd I spent harvesting I had 20 acres of wheat 5 acres   of 7 headed wheat was vary stout supposed to yield 60 or 70 bushels  to the acres I had 10 acres of touse & 5 acres of club      August 3, 1851 ~ Sunday      3rd Sunday I attended meeting Dr Bernhisel accupyed the time   in the forenoon giving an account of his procedings in washington  also his obtaining a library for Deserett      August 4, 1851 ~ Monday to August 9, 1851 ~ Saturday      4, 5, 6, 7, 8, & 9 I spent this week harvesting & going to Dr  Richards kanyon which was a horrid road      August 10, 1851 ~ Sunday      10th Sunday I attended meeting Brother Babbit attended   meeting & addressed the assembly in the forenoon mostly upon the gospel   & priesthood      August 11, 1851 ~ Monday to August 16, 1851 ~ Saturday      11, 12 & 13 ^14 15 & 16^ I spent the time mowing & harvesting      August 17, 1851 ~ Sunday to August 20, 1851 ~ Wednesday      14 15 16 17 17 Sunday I was unwell & was at home 18 19 & 20 I laboured      August 21, 1851 ~ Thursday to August 23, 1851 ~ Saturday      [FIGURE] 214 225 & 263 I spent the time in council with some 40 or 50   men and they were some of the best days of my life much  good was done light truth & the power of God was manifest  difficulties of long standing bet[w]een men were settelled the power  of God was upon president Young who is made by the power   of God a great good & glorious man & a Father indeed to the  church & kingdom of God      August 24, 1851 ~ Sunday      24th Sunday Elder O Hyde addressed the meeting & said   the floods in the western states had been exceding high  so much so that many could not emigrate there were   about 700 waggons on the way. The spirit of emigration  was among all Nations the seas were white with the   sails of evry Nation who were emigrating to this country   to find a home many might embrace the Gospel & come  to Zion & help builb it up. The feelings of the saints are   if I can get to the valley then I shall be happy  then some want to go to Sanpete to Iron county &  & to Sandiego then they would not be satisfyed & people  wish to emigrate to another world & think when they  get to Heaven their sorrow will end but their will   be things for us to reach after still when we are there &  it will continue through all Eternity. Their is many Novels  written & painted out but we do not want fals things to inter  est us. But Just look into the Book of Nature & evry  thing whether it looks up or down points to God. God is seen   in it all. Evry substance is surrounded with an atmosphere  & in some respects shows what is within     
 so their is an atmosphere surrounds all persons which you   feel when you meet with them, some persons atmosphere you   light like others you do not with some you feel safe other you do not  it is so in meeting with families. Jesus said when you go  into a house let your peeace dwell upon it but if they do not  receive you let your peacece return unto you again. This is true  doctrin (let my atmosphere be good so that the spirit of God &   good men may dwell with me in peace for that person who dwells  near the Lord & has an Eye single to his glory can tell whether he   has the spirit of God or not when he meets with him many  bodies are opake & not luminous but when the light of a lumin  ous body strikes them it sets them all in a blaze so with one   who has the spirit of God when his spirit rests upon another  it overshadows him it sets him in a blaze & the great light  can see the Heart. We are all as it were painters painting our  own characters and evry good deed will give our sign a   white coulor & evry wicked deed a black colour & when we  have painted unto the End of our days our character will be   presented before God in its true light & we shall see as we are  seen & know as we are known some think the Judgment  will not be untill after the resurrection of some thousands  of years but remember that when you lie down at night & are  weary and fall asleep before you are aware of it the morning  comes the time is past & you are awoke. But in the church &  kingdom of God what is sealed on Earth is sealed in Heaven what  is bound on Earth is bound in Heaven and if a man sins  he is soon brought into Judgment for now is the Judgment   with him. God will Judge the world but He may not Judge one  individual Himself but His servants will Judge them under his   direction. It is said the saints will Judge Angels but what  Angels why fallen Angels for those Angels who remain in  Heaven are now above us while those who are fallen are below  us for who is better able to Judge them than the Saints who   cast them out. Many other interesting remarks were made by  Elder Hyde.      Elder H. C. Kimball arose & said the remarks of Elder Hyde were  good and I will apply them and I want all to lift up their   sign and I want to imitate the best painted sign in Israel   & the character that is most like God I never expect to see a  time in all Eternity but what I shall have to abide a law   be trimmed & scourged untill I am a fit subject to become a   God. If you get into Heaven & rebell you will be cast out  their is always danger of falling as long as we are going up a   ladder.      August 25, 1851 ~ Monday      [FIGURE] Aug 25th [FIGURE] I spent the day in council with my  Brethren & while in the council the mail arived from   the States in 20 days from Independance the largest ever recieved   about 400 lbs I received 3 letters one from Azmon one from Thompson   & one from Ilus. My Brothers Azmon & Thompson Woodruff  informed me in their letters that my Step Mother Azubah Woodruff   Died [FIGURE] March 20th March 20th 1851 at 7 1/2 oclok P.M. and that   that my Brothers Azmons wife Elizabeth Woodruff   Died [FIGURE] Jan 3rd January 3rd 1851 Both were own sisters by birth I found     
 from Brother Azmons letter that he was in much sorrow he was   baptised into the church of Jesus christ of latter day saints with   myself the last of Dec in 1833 He was ordained an Elder and   myself a teacher in the church under the Hands of Zerah Pulsipher   Elizabeth my Brothers wife with the assistance of the Devil made   war on my Brother & soon caused him to leave the church he   has been in sorrow ever since with the help of the Lord I now   intend to feel after my brethren & bring them here that they   may be saved. On my arival home with my letters I called   My aged Father into the Room with me & red him the letters   from his two oldest sons containing an account of the death of   both his own wife & his sons wife he was quite resigned to the   providence of God in these things      August 26, 1851 ~ Tuesday to August 29, 1851 ~ Friday      26, 27, 28, 29, I spent a part of the time in council & a  part of it in the Harvest field   Brother G A Smith arived home from Iron County   on the 28th in good health      August 30, 1851 ~ Saturday      30th I was in council with the Elders & herd a long letter red   from Lorenzo Snow      August 31, 1851 ~ Sunday      31 Sunday Elder G. A. Smith preached to the people &   was followed by Elder O Hyde      September 1, 1851 ~ Monday      Sept 1st [FIGURE] I wrote 3 letters one long letter to Ilus   one to Thompson Woodruff & one to Father Carter  I sent Sanbon & Carter $1825.30+1237.32=3062.62 sent a draft   to Sanbon & Carter from B Young on Deseret coin   Dr J. M. Bernhisel Total sent   was $772.50      I aslso sent a letter to uncle Ozem Woodruff giving him  an invitation to come & settle with us      September 2, 1851 ~ Tuesday to September 4, 1851 ~ Thursday      2, 3, & 4 was sick & not able to labour      September 5, 1851 ~ Friday to September 6, 1851 ~ Saturday      5th & 6 spent the time hunting our family cow Moset      September 7, 1851 ~ Sunday      Sept 7th 1851 Our general conference of the   Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints met in the   tabernacle this day at 10 oclk AM. there being present of   the First Presidency B. Young H. C. Kimball & W. Richards of   the Quorum of the Twelve O. Hyde W. Woodruff G. A. Smith   & E. T. Benson. The first seven presidents of the Seventies  with the other Quoroms & a large congregation of Saints      President H. C. Kimball arose & said the conference was   not for the benefit of one but for the whole. Is the store House  full of wheat is the tithing butter & cheese brought in. some   of you will ask can I get my Endowment but I will say not one   of you will get your endowments untill you pay your tithing   Prayer by O Hyde then singing.     
 President Young arose and said as far as you can exercise patience   you should do so, we are oin comfortable circumstances & now let   us sit here & worship God & let our business rest & let us reflet   a little & exercise ourselves in our religion let our houses rest &   farms & crops let the people be still & not talk in the house or about the   window. In my meditations I am like other men who reflet  and I marvel to see men so intent upon objects that   will so soon perish. How many their are here who ask the   question how long will this Conference last I want to go I cannot   stop and others will be willing to stop & worship God some   spirits are like the troubled sea uneasy. If I could have my   wish about it I would wish such spirits to pass out of our   midst leave the congregation & let us worship in peace. We   are such an industrious people that we could not commence   conference untill Sunday. I care as little about our gardens   farms lumber &c as you do about snuffing ashes. If you get   all the riches of the world you cannot Hold them. If you will   get the wisdom it is your privilege to possess you will know   that God cares more for you than the ravens if you seek   the Kingdom of God & its righteousness the Lord will add   all things els that is necessary. Our first duty is to   provide for our families but we must take a course to accom  plish it. Fools are often rich & the wise in begery this is the   providence of God we may be ever so rich to day we may  be beggars to morrow thise is the case with those who are before   me let me draw the line between the Good & Evil Have you not had  more good than Evil more than you would had if you had been in   the world more peace than in the world & happiness than in the meditati[on]   of the things of God than in the world yes you have then shame on   the man who complains of his hardship the worst persecutions of the   people are their best days. I went to Mo in 1834 walked 2000 miles in   70 days was so weak I could not step over the fence 3 feet high. I now   have better health & strength than ever before I would not give all  Geauga County for the experience I have had in 6 months. Now stay   here dont go home untill conference Ends. Many of the Saints forget   mormonism any body who Enjoy the light of the revelations of   Jesus Christ must have the spirit of God the [FIGURE] key to mormonism   is all the truths their is all Eternity that was ever revealed or  ever will be that exhists with God Angels or men. whare shall I   go to Find truth in Mormonism. If you get a truth any whare it   is there as that covers all truth when the light came to me   sin did not revive in me and I died but I revived & lived I   had not consented to the death of any good man like Stephen  as Paul did. But let him come to any of the Churches reared   in honour to his name & the world would kill him if they could   I will ask you are you excepted [accepted] of the Father & Son you will  say I dont know, well it is because your minds are taken up with  the things of the world then let us stay here untill we do know   I am a Mormon or what is called so and I know that Joseph   was a prophet. It was revealed to me long before his death   I always thought while reading the Bible about a prophet that I   would go around the world to see one or any man who knew things  as they were & not have to guess at them. Evry thing will have   to bow to Mormonism or Eternal light & truth we have the true   government of all the Earth I know the path this people has to walk     
 I am prepared for Mormonism there was no better man   than Joseph Smith ever lived on the Earth. Hear it O ye Heavens   O ye Earth and all men this is my testimony that he is theas good a  man as ever lived save Jesus. The world will not vote for   a man because his religion governs they will not have God govern   them because of their cursed meanness but if God did not  or can not dealedout Justice & rule in righteousness who can      E T Benson spoke to edifycation said some bore record of the things  of God as they were revealed to them others believe on their testimony   the servants of God bind & seal on Earth & it is bound & sealed  in Heaven I bear testimony that we have a prophet that will hold   the keys of the kingdom of God through all Eternity also a  Patriarch both have sealed their testimony with their blood   for the cause & kingdom of God Mormonism is true & the keys of  the kingdom of God are with you the presidency of the church who   now live with us and are righteous men the Twelve, High priest,   High Council, Seventies & Elders of Israel are righteous men   Joseph said we went into the little End of the Horn & came out   of the big End of the Horn. Any thing is ours if we are faithful &  do the will of the Lord.      O Hyde took the floor and said this is one of the happiest   periods of my life. The testimony of all is good if the Brethren   who have spoken have broaken a clean loaf still I may gather   few crumbs we are living in the most important age and   when the Greatest events are to take place evry thing is on the   move the testimony of this work will go through the Earth and   the Lord will arise out of His hiding place and reign King   of Nations as He does now king of Saints, this would destroy  all the Governments of the Earth. Do the Latter day Saints   wish the Nations of the Earth any Evil No we would save   them all if we could. But it was a mercy anciently to cut   off the wicked from the Earth that their posterity should not   inherit the Earth to follow the wickedness of their fathers   Gog & Magog will ere long gather to fight against the Saints of the   Lamb of God and when hope is almost fled Christ will come  and End the scenery. If a prophet has been schooled in the   society of the Gods to come to the Earth as a prophet to do a   work for the kingdom he has the power of God with him  to help him do it the same as we ordain a man to build   up a county whare we cannot go so when a prophet   comes he comes holding the keys of the kingdom of   God & binds & seals on Earth that which is bound & sealed   in Heaven      G A Smith arose and said if I did not know the truth  I should not have taken the pains I have to preach it to the world  and act the part I have in it but I know that God has sent a   Prophet to us and ordained a Priesthood & set up his kingdom   on Earth and a religion that is not evry thing is nothing  Jesus broke bread & said Eat in rememberance of me and   this do untill I come and always remember me when Joseph was   murdered the piety of the people did not oppose his murder   when they arise will it be with white robes No but with garments   spotted with blood of the prophets. None on the Earth had sympa  thy but the Saints. I have been spending a time to build up a     
 stake in the wilderness. Why is it we have been driven   to these vallies of the mountains is it not that we may be   sheltered when the Judgments of God come on Babylon   A man should not be so taken up with his farm as to Forget  this work some will say I have done so much for this Church  that I must now do sumthing for myself there is   now many in Jackson Co who are waiting for the Saints to   come there but they will not get the blessings those will   who have come to the Salt Lake valley this is the best way  to Heaven. Some want to go to Calafornia to get rich I  want men to go with me who want to go to meeting and   get reproof & kiss the rod I had such men with me & we   done well. I bear testimony that God is with this people      W. Woodruff addressed the meeting & said he was much   interested & edifyed in the testimony which had been bour[n]   by the presidency & Twelve & those who had spoken President   Young had borne testimony that Joseph Smith was a prophet   of God He was well qualifyed to bear testimony of him He   has been with him day & night in his public & private   councils he knows his life and he has followed close in   his footsteps He always loved him and [had] he have been  in Nauvoo at the time of his arest he would have stove   the barn doors into kindling wood bwith his fist if he   could not have liberated him any other way. their   is sumthing interesting in the testimony of men the anci-  ents were martered for the testimony which they held   which they bore of Jesus Christ so men in this day   are opposed for their testimony but I know Joseph  Smith was a prophet of God so is Brigham Young the   mantle of Joseph rest upon him and he has power to  lead this people and my soul is filled with Joy   when he stands here & speaks the word of the Lord &   brings forth the glorious things of the Kingdom of God      President Young said I read that when the wicked   rule the people mourn. Ask the world do the wicked rule   yes And they mourn do they seek a righteous man [to]   rule No if the curse has followed the rule of the wicked it   will follow but let them sleep on & take your rest but   we understand the Lord has rent the veil sent Angels  to us and the gospel to preach to the poor the difference   between us & the world is they say but do not nor   believe not we say & both believe & do the world spend   thousands of Dollars to preach the gospel but do not   believe it when the Judgments of God rest upon the   wicked & they are cut off then will be the [glory]  of Grapes after the vintage is done. let the righteous   reign & the righteous will rejoice in the House of Israel God   takes up the Isles as a little thing builds up & pulls down at   his pleasure and why are not the people willing He should   reign Because of their meanness some may ask do not  good man reign. I will ask a question should an Angel   come to President Fillmore & tell him how to govern     
 the Nation & he was to tell of it they would shut him   up in a mad house and if God was to reveal to him   truth concerning the people & he was to tell of it the  people would kill him this is the situation of this  government the best on Earth. But let the president   sware & take the name of God in vaine & curse God all its  form [and] they would let him stay with them as Hail fellows  well met and the Nations will be damned & go to Hell  who killed Joseph the State of Ill in connexion with   the Carthage Mob and the whole Government ofsustained  it & they will be damned from the President to the least  member I think no more of a King or President  than of the meanest ^poorest^ begger the worst scoundrel  would is the most popular man in the Nation  this Nation is the first the gospel was sent unto she has   killed the prophets that God sent unto them & their doom   will be the Neithermost Hell      W Richards says we have had much testimony to day  I will add a few words when Hiram Smith fell in  Carthage Jail and exclaimed I am a dead man then  Joseph Smith fell dead John Taylor fell wounded I carried  him to another part of the Jail covered him up I walked  out before the people & said that Joseph & Hiram Smith  who lay before me slain were two of the best men that  ever lived Joseph Smith was a prophet of God & Hiram  a Patriarch two better men never lived two better  men God never made. Joseph was a Prophet Brigham  is as great a Prophet and he that believeth it may be  saved & he that believeth it not will be damned.      September 8, 1851 ~ Monday      Monday Morning 8th Judge Brochus requested the privilege of  addressing the people it was granted him he arose and commenced  his speach by testifying ^of^ his kind reception among this people  He had been sick among them & been kindly treated the flyies  had been brushed from his face by a Lady & he was thankful He   refered to the Judiciary requested the people to sustain it  & professed to be vary sorry that he was going to leave  it. He then refered to a report in circulation that he   came here for the Purpose of being returned a delegate to  washington & other things that were reported against   him &c. He then took up the subject of his appointment  and said that President Fillmore had appointed him   although he was a Democratt & said he should not have  received his appointment had he not been a capable virt  uous good man He then addressed the Ladies upon the  subject of the Washington Monument wished them to  procure a block of Marble & to present it to washington  also wished them to donate for the building of the Monument  talked much about the virtues of washington & his bat  tles & good deeds. He spoke of the persecution of the Saints  considered them badly treated, sent to Winter Quarters  whare our Dead was buried & had a sprig of Myrtle plucked  He carried it in his bosom it was now dryed up He showed     
 it to the Congregation. Isn speaking to the Ladies said he hoped  they would become a virtueous people he did not wish them to send  the block of Marble unless they could do it in full fellowship   with each of the seperate states composing the United States He  had red some things casting reflections upon the United   States Government concerning our persecutions but he would  defend the government as long as he had an Tongue to speak or  hand to lift and said the Government could not do any thing  for us as they had no power but if we wanted redress of our  wrongs apply to Missouri & Illinois whare we had received our  (this part of the speech stired the blood of the whole congrega-  tion) much was said by the speaker which was calculated  to stir the blood of the people and offend them He then closed      President Young arose & said the Judge Brochus was   either profoundly Ignorant or wilfully wicked   In presenting some sentiments which he had to the assembly this  day & had he have supposed for a moment that he was going to  throw out a challenge upon that stand in a religious Meeting  & present such sentiments as he had he should not for a  moment have given his consent to have had him spoken  on that occasion. He said several stood by & wished to take up  the challenge given by the Judge but he would not permit  of it for some might get their hair pulled if not their  throats cut. And he would not have it He wished the  meeting to adjourn & meet in the afternoon & transact  business in the capacity of a conference for which the meeting  was called Meeting adjourned one hour      Met according to adjournment. After singing & prayer Brother  Kempton addressed the meeting was followed By Broth Gifford.  Br John Young next addressed the House & was followed by   H. C. Kimball who said I will tell one thing that will   have a great effect upon us will remove the mist when we   come to the House of the Lord Bring an offering to the Lord I  wil make an Offering to the Lord & to the priesthood as Abram  did to Melchezedic & offer the best you have. did this law  come from Joseph who was ordained under the hands of  Peter Brigham Young was ordained under the hands of  Joseph to hold the keys of the Kingdom of God if you strike  against him you strike against God who sent him  The Judges came here to Judge criminals not to Judge us  who keep the Law. He then sat down & we had a song from  the welsh Brethren      President Young then arose & said I will speak of principle  you may think it is a Novel conference How long has it been  since we have had the privilege of spending a conference  undeisturbed a long time I would like to hear Brother  Kempton speak or any good man. I will preach Br Abbott  funeral sermon and the funeral sermon of all the faithful  His body is laid in the dust to rest untill the resurrection forever  blessed is the man that lives & dies a Saint. I will tell whether  the Messenger sent to Brother Kempton was of God or the Devil  If the Messenger sent was of God he would know it, if the messenger was  any whare els but here he must have come from Heaven or from     
 another Hell for we are in Hell go to the world & preach the gospel  you will find some people as honest & good as Angels as far as they  know but do they have revelations from God & know the things  of God No they do not. If Brother Kempton has had his sins   forgiven & remitted without baptism so could all men  but this is false for no man could have forgiveness without  the sheding of blood & baptism the Bible says unless you keep the  commandments you cannot be saved when Br Kempton sayes  he knows his sins were forgiven before he was baptized   he dont know what he sayes At times the spirit of God is given  to men to see the kingdom of God and they think they are   in it when they have not entered the door of baptism dont  go & call the different Denominations because their sins are  not forgiven them that they are always going to dwell in Hell  for if they aere honest they will have a glory greater than   many who carry the Gospel to men their is as good people  among all sects Gentiles Jews & Heathen as their is on Earth  they act according to the best light they have. what is the condem-  nation of this Government, light has come into the world & men love  darkness rather the light they reject that light fight the prop  hets & shed their blood for this they are damned      Elder Sherwood arose & said that the priesthood had made Joseph  Brigham & all men what they were by the assistance of light & truth  as far as we follow light & truth so far we shall appoxamate   towards light & truth & God if God & Angels were made what  they are by truth as far as we learn that truth & follows out   the council of it so far he will be like God & when he leaves that  truth he goes into darkness & misery. If the United States were practi-  zing truth they would be vary different from what they now are  the practice of right things make men rejoice the practice of Evil  things make sorrow we are agents to do right or wrong if a man  feels disposed to go to Hell he has a right to it is no mans business  He goes on his own responsibility and agency so if he wishes to  Go to Heaven he has a right to by keeping a Celestial law let me  do my work to acceptance. we know many truths we cannot think  off [of]. Adjourned untill 2 oclok      Met according to adjournment. The officers of the church were   presented to the assembly and accepted in the following order  The Presidency, Twelve, President of the stake, Patriarch, High  council, High Priest, Seventies, Bishops, Elders priests Teachers  & Deacons Perpetual Emigrating Company, & Historian, Building  Committee.      President Young sayes I want to esstablish some travelling  Bishops a thing that we never have done. when I approach  the subject of the Bishops I pause not with a trembling hand  but I want to take time & look at it all day until we can see   clearer than we now do. this people still stick to the world   love the world, we should use the world & not worship it  No man is free indeed untill he is free in Christ and  above the world dont worship the world you will not be free  Is their any one that has anything but what God gave him  you cannot make one hair white or black. Now it is our  duty to feed cloth & sustain the families of those who are in  the vineyard preaching if we let them suffer & they die their  blood will be required at our hands we as a people have never     
 done it yet but it was time it was done. The Bishops are reproved they  dont do their duty. N.H. Felt & John Banks was ordained Travelling  Bishops. E. T. Benson J. M. Grant & O Hyde were set apart to  go to Kanesville & gather out all the Saints in that region of country  Samuel Richards was appointed to go to England. Willard  Snow & A. O. Smoot was appointed to Go to England.  D Carnes to Jermany, Dorr P Curriss & Venson Shirtliff on   a foreign mission Dr Donyan to preach in the Eastern States  Clayton then red an account of the Tithing.  The Patriarch John Smith said I rejoice to have the  privilege of speaking to you I have been in the work since   Jan 1832, and am about the oldest man here I was ordained   an Elder under the Hands of Joseph Wakefield. The  Smith family was chosen to bring forth this work My  team halled the first load of stone to build the kirtland temple  my Son George A Drove the team. There was 4 Brothers  us in the stand in Kirtland I am now left alone. I was in  Jail with Joseph & Hiram the night before they were killed, next  day 3 guns were snaped at me I could not weep for a long time  when I did weep I wept much. I have laboured much from   that untill this to keep things right. It is the little Foxes that spoil  the vines we have a Prophet for a leader now pay your tithing  & make good measure when you sell any thing, & fulfill all your  covenants if made right we shall then prosper in this valley  I am an old man & cannot say much but I will write a peace  to be published in the paper      H. C. Kimball said I am going to make an offering to president  Young Abram paid tithes to Melchezedeck. A certain woman gave  a purse others filled it Br Rhodes gave the President sixty  four pounds of gold for the public works He has not lacked anything  you should give the best you have to the Lord & He will pour you out  a blessing that there will not be room to receive it      Bishop Edward Hunter spoke said he was appointed the Chief Bishop  was thankful for the confidence put in him. I want to bear  my testimony of the things of God He spoke of his experience wanted  to know his duty & was ready to do it.      W. W. Phelps spoke took for a text Pay your tithing     Brother Chase speaks, start right, keep right & then you will  come out right He spoke well upon tithing      Z Pulsipher spoke & said I feel thankful to hear the aged  Brethren speak & bear their testimony of the Prophet Joseph  we have had many revelations let us improve upon them      B. Young said I will put the motion will the sisters  vote to quit using tea & coffee, the Brethren have voted  not to use tobaco I will speak of the Bishops I spoke of them   yesterday, & reproved them sharply some wanted them ^me^ to offer  an apology to them I will not I will see them in Hell before I will do   it. If this people do not do better than the Bishops have they will  and if you do not do better than you have done you will go to Hell  I will begin with myself. I have taught the Bishops principle &   their duty Ask them if they can do it No I will cut the Bishops   off from the Church if they do not do better. did I ever council  them wrong you have trampled my council under foot I shall  not shrink from duty. I say to all old & young pray in your   learn to pray. Pray in your families. Be content in all circumstances     
 whare the Lord shall place you. scease your contention one with   another Never go to law. gather your families together &   pray for me & my Brethren & yourselves untill a blessing [rains upon]   us.      Noah Packard spoke said many things said he wanted to   be a son of thunder.      E. D. Woolley addressed the meeting made many good remarks  said we had a Joseph with us in the person of B. Young      B Young wished to say a few words to the Mormon Battalion those   who are wanting their extra pay are applying to William, Blair   & Babbit if you apply to these men & give them the papers &   they cheat you out of it dont complan, & I say to those   men not to take any papers from those who have had their   pay or sold their claims to others. If you want your pay apply   here, & you can get it. You did not enlist to get $8 pr month   they enlisted us to kill us and because we speak our sentimets   we are accused of treason I dont ask any odds of the U.S. I will   express my feelings to drive us from our Millions & possessions   than require us to fight their battles is not right.      I shall pay my tithing. The Twelve will pay one 10th of their possess[ions]   & the Bishops and all will pay their tithing. This is the kingdom   of God & if it falls I am willing to fall with it. I had rather   fall than stand if the Priesthood falls. All covenanted   to pay their tithing one tenth of all they possess      Bishop Hunter spok upon the tithing would begin with himself   & wished all the Bishops to do the same      Lorenzo Young spoke upon the Tithing      President Youg said he wished all the people to pay their   tithing to the Bishops of their ward. He refered to the remarks   made by Father Smith on the word of wisdom. He said $50000   dollars had been spent in the valley during the past year for needless   things for Coffee tea Tobaco &c many others remaks were mad  By president Youg "Elder Banks spoke upon the law of liberty  President Youg followed in reply & said the liberty of the Holy Gospel   was peace & righteousness we had no liberty to take away another   mans rights but the first principle of liberty was resignation &   submission for go whare you will to Heaven or Hell you have to submit   to laws we are at liberty to adobt evry Holy principle to all  Eternity go East North or South keep evry thing you want for   yourself wife children houses cattle & create out of the elements   evry thing you can yet you are not at liberty to infringe   upon the rights of men you may have the privilege to do all   things that is done in heaven. Organize the elements give commands   & rule over kingdoms but be subject to such laws as you   are under the law of liberty is to do right for God to all   Eternity the opposite principle is to be discontented with things   to be different from what they are this is Hell & all the Hell their   is I dont care how things are if I do right we shall find the law   of liberty to be Eternal life light & peace which will increase   to all Eternity we ought not to do an Evil to cause pain to any crea-  ture, still their are some things that would appear to be evil I know   to be good to cut some mens heads off as it would be the ownly   way they could be saved. God will increase his kingdom to   all Eternity so shall we increase our kingdom to all Eternity     
 Abraham seed will reign as kings of kings & Lords of   Lords & to his seed their is no end let this people live  & do right & the blessings of God will atted you to all Eternity      Conferenc was adjourned untill the 6th Oct      October 5, 1851 ~ Sunday      Sunday Oct 5th Elder O. Pratt addressed the assembly   and said I feel thankful to once more tread my feet in   the valley after being absent 4 years I feel thankful to behold   the faces of my brethren & friends & see the improvements   that have been made in my abscence. I could not tell whare   I was I was in danger of being lost without a guide I trust  that while I have been absent on a mission to Great Britain I   have also been assisting to build up the kingdom of God &   when I left I believed it would continue to roll forth  the work had taken such a deep root the powers of darkness  could not break it up it seemed at times as though we  should take the kingdom. The organization of the Churches   by the Twelve in that country was so perfect that notwithsta[ndin]g   the great spread & increase of the work we can know  monthly the state of the Churches increase &c throughout the   whole realm. The faith of the Saints in that land was  increasing a great spirit of enquiry was manifesting  itself in the High ranks of Society esspecially when they   hear of the rapid progress of the work & prosperity of this   people we are not hid up as some suppose. It is the general   Idea that we are destined to become a great people & a   Mighty Nation (is this treason) we are a strong people &   destined to be stronger untill our News reaches the utmost   parts of the Earth so that when the Mail comes the question   will be asked what News do you hear from that mighty   people in the Mountains as the emigration increases & ship   arive It will all increase the work & it will be as impossible to   hide it from the world as it would for the shining of the sun   to be hid & Zion will be terrible to the Nations of the Earth  I feel as great a desire to help bear up the kingdom as a   man can I am willing to spend my life & all I have   to build up this kingdom I am willing to stay here or go   back tomorrow I presume this is the feelings of the Elders   here in this body their is Nothing so Joyful as to build up   the kingdom I would rather be abroad binding up the   grain than to break up my Farm if I had all the welth   of the Earth I would rather go without purse or scrip than to spend   the time to work for myself when I look at the magnitude of   this work I cannot feel otherwise with the spirit of God in my   heart I want to see the Seventies going forth & gathering from   all kingdoms & countries & from every Island of the Sea untill   all Israel is gatherd. I do not feel to say more to day but will  sit down & hear from my Brethren, I wish to do my duty while here      G. A. Smith said it is with pleasure I behold the faces of O. Prat  & others this is my Fathers House we have had good instruct  ion from our Brother here I have spent my time to settel   other Colonies we cannot all settel down here we should   spend our lives to improve & prepare ourselves for immortal glory     
 and exhaltation. I have exhorted my new comers to go down   to the south before they settel here & help to build up a stake   if you remember the words of God in the days of Joseph   says Ye are laying the foundation of a great work and ye   know it not. we are now preparing to have a state   soon, soon the Brethren will come by 10 100 1000 & 10000  We have at Parowan 80 men & boys we want to have   evry man who knows any thing about making Iron   go to Iron Co. & make Iron as long as we have to buy   evry thing & pay 3 prices for it we shall be poor I   would rather mak our own ware & ploughes than to be a slave   to Missouri or Ill. I never dreamed that when I or any Elder  had a mission to preach the Gospel or build up Zion to ask   to be dismissed or return home untill my work was   closed such an Idea Never enterd my brain. If the   Saints will scatter abroad & settle these far vallies we can   come up here & present our tithings & offering & come & wor  ship as they did in Jerrusalem come & raise 1000 bushels   of wheat & potatoes & say to the Nations of the Earth come   & eat & do sumthing to build up Zion.       Afternoon President Young sayes we hear the Brethren arise  & return thanks for the blessings received we can respond to it   the work is of all importance to the Human family the   Brethren are all willing to do right & they say Lord not   my will but thine be done. If the Lord should say come   & preach to us we would say Amen to it the Lord has his   means to carry on his work and also his own means to do it   when the peoples hearts are prepared to do the will of   God the victory is ours if we come to understanding so   as to have the organization of the kingdom of God so that   evryone acts in unison like a beautiful peace of machinery   [when] we gain the victory we shall then know how to order our   speech & conversation aright before God this is a good   people cannot we be better we have faith & knowledge  cannot we have more of it yes their is an Eternity of it. we   have learned to obey by the things we suffer but what do we   behold their is evil surmising, speaking, & doing. the Evil intruder  has not left us. who is keeping this commandment that loves   his Neighbor as he does himself will save his Neighbor   Garden & crops &c we shall then believe & practice all  the commands we shall have one common interest I   dont care what you believe if you practice right & act   as though you love the Lord & then you will do right their   is no school like your own experience when I herd Geore   A. Smith speak I thought of former days when men   from Canida & other places [would] stop 50 miles this side of   Kirtland leave the money with the wife go & see Joseph   & say how I love you. But let Joseph ask him for a  few dollars & they would instantly dodge at it while in   the world you would go away now you are here I canot   get you to go to the far vallies because warfare & [carthage]  are not there I felt like crying abot Amasa company they   were ready to go to Hell. How ready the people are to go to Hell   let the Eyes of the saints be open I had to plead with     
 A Lyman & company for days not to go I could not stay   them Now I want you to go & you wont go I want to have   you go to Iron Co. the people here are so full of wheat & good   things that they loath it. If you dont want to pay your   tithing the Lord dont want you tithing untill you go into Hell   if you dont want to save yourself nor your children   nor your dead dont pay your tithing if you do want to save   then pay your tithing for it is for your benefit not   mine you cannot do the Lord any good in it or add to   his glory but it is for yourself. The cattle have come   in well of late and I think the best has been sent in  you should be industrious & saving, I dont want my children   to b[e] lazy if I die I dont want any man to foster them in   idleness make your cloth yourself I wish my boys   had to work as I did for a living.      October 6, 1851 ~ Monday      Monday Oct 6th Conference assembled according to   adjournment singing & Prayer by W W Phelps   President Young said the time had come to commence   the business of the semianual conference the business   of the last conference was productive of more good   than any conference we ever held. the keeping   of the word of wisdom has done much good I will be  exceding glad when we arive at wisdom in all things   the word of wisdom was given in Kirtland 20 years   ago for the benefit of all Saints when we live 20  or 50 years longer we shall see that we do not   understand much of the word of wisdom we are   but babes in understanding wisdom who understands   it, was all spoken that might be spoken their is but  one ysystem of explaining any Revelation & that is the Rev-  elation of Jesus Christ in the heart of man when he   possesses the Holy Ghost we are forbidden to use meat in hot   weather. Hot drinks & tobaco is not good for man you should  not eat to over load your stomach. their is a greater   lack in my system of wisdom of tempering my food &   exercise than in eating meat or tobaco. Tithing is com  ing in so fast their will not be room to receive it   I wanted this conference to come together so I could   see their faces not to scold them I want to see their   faces they look better to me than all the Glories of   the Earth I said when the Brethren got out of   prision I wanted to sit & look at them three weeks Our   graineries & stour house are full of wheat & good things   If this people are rich beautiful & happy I am with  them. If they are miserable I am still with them if this   people are not Crowned & saved none of us will  be [FIGURE] it is in vain for one man to build himself up &   neglect his brothers interest He will fail in it. we   must begin to manifacture all we want or we are slaves   to every thing in all the Earth evry thing is against   Mormonism & Mormonism is against evry thing everything   is against us Hear it O Earth for the kingdom of God is   against all Earth & Hell this is true & we shall fight     
 them untill the kingdom of this world become the kingdom  of our God we shall fight battle after battle untill  the victory is won we have to fight & lay down our   lives for Christ sake we now want to gather companies   to go to the different vallies. I want the potters to rem[ain]   here & work at their business. Jesus descended below  all things before He ascended above all things we have  got to sacrafice ever freely in order to be exhalted   before God. I once said I will go & build me a house  on the hill out of the mud. Joseph said you will stay   whare you are this was enough I dodged as quick as I   could I said enough since I have been willing to be   Governed by circumstances that have surrounded me   & leave the event in the Hands of God      Judge Snow said I arived in the valley in July last  I expected to sit & hear & learn I have been a silent   observer of your temporal & spiritual matters. Your   Governor has laid a foundation for you to build upon   I consider it to be the province of this people to determi[ne]   for themselves what they most need I do not see that  you will break any law of God in doing right & your   own will I like the remarks made that you be free   & not abject slaves make what you want & be free   buy all you want & be slaves. we say we look to gGod   & do his will. We are a little people upon a little patch   of the Earth but if we all pull together we shall become  the Head. I did not run with the rest because I thought   it right to stay. If I thought it right to run I should   run, but it was right to stay so you must be right   the Lord said you must gain your bread by the sweat  of the brow you must make your own leather or you   cannot get money enogh to buy it with so with   tea coffee & sugar you must raise & make it or go   without it you must make your own Iron or fail  for Iron must be had. leathier & Iron must be maid  & make your own clothing. I like your conferences  & to hear the best men speak to communicate intel-  ligence to others the church all draws one way & this   puzzles the world they all draw one way & have a   reason for it this I glory in I would not obey   if their was not a reason for it I would leave   Z Snow would not draw with you if he could not  give a reason for it. I came here to deal out Justice   to all Jew & Gentile alike I came not to watch for  iniquity but to punish iniquity when it does appear   I have had 200 cases in a year with the same No  as you are I hope you will not have a case you will   never be destroyed unless you destroy yourselfves   if you do not war with yourselves I hope others will  not war with you       B Young said at our conference we appointed Felt   & Banks to be travelling Bishops to visit other Bishops  to call them to an account & see that they are     
 Faithful Bishops & you should feed the poor & do your  duty untill the spirit of God rest upon you & you hold   the keys of the Melechezedek priesthood of the Eternal God   & the power of it rest upon you forever  Brother Banks & Felt were Ordained under the hands   of the Presidency.       Afternoon prayer by A Cordon. H. C. Kimball   says A Cordon is nominated to be a travelling [Bishop] carried   unanimously He was ordained under the hands of HCK  John & G A Smith Heber C Kimball sealed upon  his head all the keys of the priesthood said the power   of God should rest upon his head to preside over  other Bishops. Another thing is necessary which will  effect the whole world that is a reffermation chose   men who are filled with the Holy Ghost to go forth as   missionaries to stir up the feelings of the Saints in   all these vallies of the Mountains I thank God   that we are free Joseph Young D Fulmer &   Z Pulsipher was appointed as missionaries      G A Smith arose & said I feel perfectly at   home here I want to speak concerning Iron Co I   had but 20 or 30 with me there President Young wants  John D Lee to get a company to go over the rim   of the Basin & form a settlement in a good place    for wine fruit & corn I asked some of Amasas   company what they were going to do they said they   were going to plant a vineyard if they had done   it there they would have done good you should  go to Iron Co settle your families then go down   in the winter & build a fort the Indians there   are well supplyed with arrows on foot No arrows   or guns it is poorer than Iron Co it borders upon   the Great sahara desert I felt that we are  free when I heard that Iron & coal was found in   abundance within 15 miles of each other in Iron Co. we   have not the Great Blast Furnises that are in the   world but must begin with the Native Element. He   also made other remarks      B Young made remarks concerning the education of our children   wished parents to pay particular attention to teaching their children   after which the conference closed it was one of the most   interesting conferences ever held by this people.      October 9, 1851 ~ Thursday      Nov [October] 9th Sunday O Pratt addressed the assembly &   said he did not believe any man capable or qualifyed to   speak acceptable to God no matter what his abilities  were unless he had the spirit of the Holy Ghost He would   not take any office on Earth if the office of the president   of the United States was offered him he would disdain it  as far as the honor of it was concerned He would rather  have the office of a teacher in this church as it would last     
 forever while the office of president of the U.S would not  last but 4 or 8 years I should be glad to live to see the   day when their should not be a Kingdom or government   on Earth ownly that ordained of God to govern the   world I do not know as I shall live to see it but I have  much desired it for a man to desire to live merely to  get honor to himself would not be right but for him  to desire to live to honor God & build up his kingdom would  be a good desire. If I knew I could be translated to all   the glory of the Celestial Kingdom in an instant I would  rather live & suffer with my Brethren through all their  troubles untill the coming of Christ I am sorry to see  the old vetrans who have helped to lay the foundation of  this church lay their bodies in the Grave I believe  many will live those who have had it promised unto them  if they remain faithful untill the coming of Christ & help  build up the kingdom this has been promised to me by  the patriarch & prophet while receiving my Endowment  the hearts of men were inspired to give us these blessings  while their hands were upon our heads. this always stim-  ulates us to hold on by faith when death is around us &   slayes thousands upon our right & left hand it is an easy matter  for God to strengthen a man in his Tabernacle in the midst of  Death & plagues all around him He did the Ancients who lived  to a great Age their Eyes were not dim their Ears were quick  to hear but we all have weaknesses & much to contend with  this is that we may increase & arive at Great Glory by   getting the mastery over the devil & much evil if we were   not tempted & tryed & overcome we should not get the  glory that we otherwise shall. How could God trust a man   who would be overcome by temptation it would take him  a long time to get confidence in him again Jesus was  a fair sample subject as He was to temptation in all things  He overcame so can we & follow in the steps of our Elder   Brother Better to do this than to Enjoy the pleasure of sin for  a season then die as the fool dieth if a man had power given  him & had not discretion given him to use it he would ruin  himself this is the reason why this people 20 years old  has not power greater power they have not wisdom to use it  we have the gifts of the Gospel to heal the sick to speak  with New tongues, to cause the blind to see lame to walk  deaf to hear, & cast out devels & with these gifts some   have been so lifted up taken honor & glory unto themselves  they have fallen. I thank God for sparing his gifts any  further than they prove beneficial to us if God gave us all  things at once it would kill us but if we were proven in all  things then we could endure all things (things are freq-  uently given of the Lord that men cannot all endure they  are more than they have wisdom to manage when this is  the case they cannot advance untill they master what has  been given let this be remembered & not ask for more after  what we can manage for if we ask the Lord for a Revelati-  on & He gives us a New commandment we are under the greater respon-  sibility for we have to keep all the commandments of God     
 if commandments are given us & we dont obey then our  light becomes darkness then how great is that darkness  it would be better for him not to have the light at all  If the Lord had given all men all they have asked for  they would many of them been out of the Church now I have  herd many say I have Asked the Lord to reveal certain  principls unto me & He did not do it but this is because it  was not wisdom to give it unto you but if you are faithful  the day will come when God will give any man what he  asks for if he asks for it in righteousness. I believe the   Lord loves this people & is preparing us to recieve all good   things the day will come when the Lamanites will build  a city called the New Jerrusalem. They not we build  it we with all the Gentiles who repent will help build it  the powers of Heaven will be revealed & Jesus be in our  midst and the power of Heaven be revealed by Adam   & all men will hear it in the kingdom of God and all secrets  & key words of the priesthood & all things will be revealed  I hope you will harken to council & do all things which   God Requires of us in the name of Jesus Christ Amen      October 12, 1851 ~ Sunday      Sunday 12th S M Blair spoke to the people & gave a  good exhortation      Brother Simeon Carter followed the same day spoke of the deeds   of the prophet He knew the Twelve had to lead, had no desire  to follow any body els. He was followed By Brother Major      October 19, 1851 ~ Sunday      Sunday 20th [19th] Oct Elder O Pratt spoke upon the death  of Sister Hendricks. He was thankful we as a people were  settelled in these vallies of the Mountains whare it was  healthy we have here to fore suffered much by sickness in  other places but we cannot get entirely away from  sickness & death let us go whare we will in this life  for all men must taste of death even those who   were translated had to have a change to Immortality  their may be some pain attending that even if it   was ownly for an instant. Their must be some space  between death & the resurrection sin is the cause of this  evil even death without sin men would have been  Immortal. If I should hear of a God who had made   man to have pain & sorrow without any agency or sin  I could not have any confidence in him, & the Heavens could  not it may be said it is necessary to have sorrow & misery  in order to Enjoy good the Lord when He made the world  knew how to fix things so that man should bring upon  himself death evil & sorrow if he had ag[ency] He planted   the tree of knowledge of good Evil in the midst of the  garden little children did not commit sin but their  parents did it was not our own sins that brought death  but the sin of our first parents death being introduced  into the world we all partake of it if we had not the great  plan of salvation revealed we should be without law  if it was not for revelation we should not know that  we had an Immortal spirit within us we should take     
 care of the spirit as well as our bodies the spirit needs taking  care of as well as the body the spirit is a being that   possesses certain capacities that are as Eternal as   God himself that were never given to it I do not believe   that any matter that ever saw the time that it could not love  hate fear &c can ever do it again but I believe it is Eternal  the formation may not be Eternal but the substance of which  it is composed is Eternal the capacities may be enlarged but  its capacity always exhisted their may be a time when our  spirits had a begining of formation but the capacity always  exhisted the Infant at first appeared as a blank page but   that spirit before it came here was full of knowledge as was  the case with the Babe of Bethlehe[m] Jesus Christ He had wisdom   to construct worlds before He came here but had now descended  below all things came from His Fathers throne but his knowledge  power & wisdom was laid aside & nothing but the bare capacity  was left can any man remember the first month of his  life in the flesh No Neither can you remember the time  of your exhistance or doings before you came here this  is to prove men if they will prove faithful while this know  led[g]e is taken from them in infancy childhood & manhood   life & Death if one man Jesus Christ can ascend &   overcome all things so can another. If we find anything  that is good lovely, virtueous, good, exhalted then let   us lay hold of it untill we are exhaulted then the spirit   will adorn the body & do away with many of the Evils  of the fall their is sumthing in the countena[n]ce of a  man who takes care of his spirit that is glorious  & good the Lord made the spirit of man according to the  plan devised in his wisdom but this was made of   Eternal substance of many beings composed in orse   in ourselves brought together into one & Gems given to our  spirits then let us take care of our spirits. many thing  may be said about the object of our bodies & spirits they  are destined to arise in glory Exhaltation And Eternal   life then let us take care of our bodies & spirits we have  our minds filled with the cares of life & yet when   we die we have to leave all our temporal affairs it   seems to be the object of God that we should earn   our bread by the sweat of the brow if this was not  the case we might be Idle which would produce more  evil than it would to labour if we improve our time  we shall get glory that we should not get if  we were Idle for when we die the knowledge  we have gained will be of benefit to us we cannot  get a fulness of Glory while our spirit & body is  seperated we may think reflect & know right  from wrong but we cannot act as in the body we   shall look for the resurrection of the body with much  interest & great anxiety if it was not for the resurrection  of the body we should be subject to the devil & death  temporal & spiritual those who kept the celestial law  will be redeemed from all sin & death restored to  God and all blessings their is for man such will have  Joy in paradice. Joseph says if we keep the law we shall     
 we shall have a celestial paradice & our spirits return  & hunt up our bodies & enter it again with a fulness of  celestial spirit. How will the Resurrection be brought  to pass & when will be the different times of the resurrection  the good ^{and bad}^ will arise before those who die after the Resurrection  of Christ the good did arise at the Resurrection of Christ  we find mummies in the catacombs of Egypt who died  long before christ arose who remain yet some saints in  Asia & America did arise & appear unto many. I do not   believe the resurrection will take place by being born again  as the doctrin of some is I would not believe it for the world  unless President Young was to say the Lord had revealed   it to him I believe the Saints will arise out of their   graves [##Ezekiel 34:12##] as Ezekiel said they would. The Resurrection  will take place before the son of Man comes as the scriptures  declair. Before He comes their shall be a great sign appear  in Heaven all the Nations of the Earth shall see it together  An Angel shall sound his trump that all Nations will   hear it saying that Babylon will be burned then after  half an hour of silence the veil of the covering will be  taken off the face of Heaven will be revealed & the   face of the Lord will be unveiled and the graves of the  Saints will be open & the Saints on the Earth will be caught   up to meet the Lord this is the first Resurrection the  Zion of Enoch will also appear & dwell on the Earth  the Saints will then receive their Everlasting inher  itances Joseph got a promise from the Lord that  he should have a right to an inheritance in the Nauvoo   House forever. if the Saints do not get their possessions   by covenant as Abram did Canaan or Joseph  Nauvoo their will be Judges appointed to give evry   man his inheritances for an Everlasting inheritance  then comes the time when Joseph and all will receive  their keys & turn them to the saints in this dispensation  & reveal the mysteries of Eternity to the Saints who  have their celestial bodies they will be qualifyed  to receive a fulness of celestial glory & spirit & will  receive all they can Endure but they will grow to  all Eternity in knowledge & power will the Saints be  confined to this Earth No they will be caught up   & not die & lie in the dust Jesus will have a Throne  in Jerrusalem & the Saints will have thrones on the  Earth but they will go to other worlds or in the Heavens  & all will be free Adam will give instructions concerning  the garden of Eden we will go on foreign missions  to visit other worlds we shall also remember our works  in this life & inasmuch as they have been good it will  be a consolation to reflect upon them      I Baptized Sister Foss & family & my own family & confirmed  them 9 in all.      Rhoda Foss was Married on the eve of Nov 30th 1851     
 President Youngs medical lecture deliverd before  the board of Health at Great Salt Lake City Dec 1851      President Young arose & said I wish to impart intelli-  gence to the people my first proposition is the science of  medicine. The study & practice of medicine as a science if it   may be called a science is the most imperfect of any science   in existance as is practiced by the doctors of the present day  The doctors & priests of the day send more to death & Hell then  any whare els. about one in a million may get some glory  A bigger set of cursed scoundrels never graced the Earth than  that class. surgery is a different class & is vary necessary in   many instances & that system can be learned. But to learn the   system of man they cannot no more learn that than they   can learn the Heavens. A worst set of Ignoramuses do not  walk the Earth. they do not know how to turn {the [[illegible} wind in a mans  body when it gets cross ways. If you cut their infernal throats   the people will live I know what this society is here for it is to impart  what knowledge they have to others. But I have seen the folly of the   doctors even at my own doors. take them as a whole they are   the most damnable set on the Earth their practices are infamous   & their medicines produce death; If the people want to Eat  Calomel let them do it & be damned but dont feed it to  any of my family if any doctor does & I know it I would  kill him as quick as I would for feeding Arsnic. I do not   employ such doctors to visit me. I dont Employ any doctor  to visit me. The practice of Doctors in visiting women in child  birth is damnable woman should be let alone & let Nature  have its part at work let a woman keep her child if she can  2 or 3 years but she cannot do it when the time has come Nat-  ure will deliver her of her child without a Doctor dont  fret let evry thing take its proper course & sickness would   depart away. The Doctors in New Haven Ct by mutual   agreement to see how far they could frighten a man did  actually frighten him to death a robust harty man. many   things should be said to this people. their has not been a  Doctor baptized into this church that has the Holy Ghost  but what will acknowledge they are a fool. their is not a  Physician in the church or in the world that is taught  from on high by revelation but what will acknowledge   this to be true doctrin if their is a doctor who can see &   know a man from head to foot & know how to cure his   deseases by revelation such are the ownly true & safe   Doctors on Earth all others are fools I see men die  in the hands of the doctors. the medicines kill them. why   dont they tell what ales the patient or acknowledges   they dont know.      The foolery their is among this class   is disgraceful & makes me mad & the day will come when you  will not wonder at my feelings you are natural persons  & God has made you natural if you are with child that child  will come forth by nature without a Dr the Earth is just  so will bring forth of itself seed after its kind. If a person is  sick & have not faith to be healed give them herbs the product   of the Earth & it will cure you until it is time to die     
 when a cat is sick she will eat catnip without a   doctor & she gets well Nature promps her to it if a  dog is bit with a rattlesnake he will dig a hole in the Earth   & lie in the ground untill the poison is gone out so   Nature will teach us as well as the cat & dog when a toad   is bit by a spider [it] will go & eat plantain if he can get it.  If a child is to die in being born let it die but dont   employ a Dr to kill it. How will you be instructed I will   tell you what to do if you are taken sick dont be frightened   but be ca[l]me. if you get a cold let Nature be jo◊◊  disease will go up & down through the system to find a  place to be located it is as much our duty to know how to   cure our system as to feed our body the Doctors would   say you are deseased & dont know it who made the Doctors the   Devil. The Lord did not make the Doctors of the present day  such a thing as a man midwife was not known untill   about 1500 why did not the women all die before this time  look at the Indians for 100 years millions of children  have been born in the wilderness of male & female & they live  & not die without a doctor. You may ask what shall we do  I will tell you I will give you a lessen & I want you to remark   it when you go to visit a woman in trava[i]l let her alone   untill her full time has come remember it let the mother  alone let your system be natural teach them also to exercise  all that they can that when they come to be deliverd it will  be better for them. A doctor if he had good sens would not  wish to visit women in child birth, and if a woman  had good sense she would not wish a man to doctor them   on such an occasion I want you to teach your children   the principle of truth I talk as I do for the people will  not sens any thing unless they are half knocked down or   thunder rolls in their Eaers soft words will not do I   want you to hear & understad their has been some difficulty  in this Board of Health. If I had been with you you would not   had had any difficulty. It has been through a misunderstanding  if you understand principle you would not quarrel you  may spread calomel on your bread & butter & eat it if   you wish but it is deadly poison as Arsenic but not as  quick it is not good you may ask if it was ever good  in any case there may be cases whare it might be a   benefit but it would want a revelation to tell whare   it was. Their is not poison in lobelia I will give  $5000 dollars for the 16 part of an oz of poison that   can be extracted out of all the lobelia in this valley. it is  not probable that any two persons are organized just alike  in all respects. Then who is a Physician Now unless he  be taught of God & is a prophet or revelator he cannot   understand the Human System know desease & what will cure it  I dont care how a man acts if he inte[n]ds to act right & when they  act wrong are willing to be righted. we will take the Best physician  of the day that lives the closest to the Lord I dont care how will  he is he will be brought down as a fool for he will be  made to let God be honored.  I have been on a Journey in   the dust I have got dust on my brain that is what ales me     
 It will wash off could a doctor tell what ales me No  can a doctor tell what ales a sick man by feeling of   his pulse No more than he could by feeling of a dogs   tail. Their is no Physician except he is taught of God  you should learn how to doctor yourselves you should study  your own system, any people who must trust to a doctor at  all times will die but trust in God & you will live longer  what a diferent time it would be if all trusted in God   rather than in the doctors for 9 out of 10 die under the  doctors care who would live if they trusted in God alone  dont get freightened & you will do well enough it is Just  as reasonable to send for a doctor to have a calf, colt or  pig brought forth as it was for a child.      After you receive your reserrected bodies you will bring   forth spirits to all Eternity who will go to some world & take   a tabernacle or body the same as we have you dont want a   doctor any more here than there if the members of this   society are true either male or female they will inpart all   useful knowledge they have to others if they are not willing to  do this they are corrupt if one man knows more than another   let him tell his knowledge & if a man knows more than  all the rest let him be a Father unto the people & teach  them & not act like a boy, if I hold myself Equal I am   Equal if I am soperior let me manifest it by doing a   better deed & being superior myself. It is the man that rejects   light & knowledge when shown him that God condemns & I   condemn him some say we have spiritual wives but I  think God has made us all natural & I think we should be   Natural.      We received several lectures from Judge Zerubabel Snow   concerning law our Legislative Enactments & various other   subjects. He commenced with the constitution of the United   States said the several states sent delegates & formed a   general convention & there after deliberating upon the  situation they agreed to form a constitution & to cede up   a portion of their state rights for the purpose of forming a   general government constitution & congress of the United  States and all the power that was not ceded up still   remains with the people and it was his opinion that  we as a people had a right to make such laws as suited  our own convenience Notions & circumstances, as long as  it did not conflict with the constitution of the united of  the their were rights belonging to all civilized men   which no power had a lawful right to take from them  and he advised us to make such laws as we wished without  any regard to the common law of Englan or the laws which  any of the states had adopted as long as we did not interfere   with any of the constitution of the United States. He dwelt  lengthy upon the criminal code which we should adopt that  criminal law was considerd more for the suppression of   crime than for the punishment of the guilty      I ordained 8 High priest & 7 members of the quorums of seventies  at different Councils at the Council House not befor recorded

 January 4, 1852 ~ Sunday      Sunday Jan 4th 1852  President Young addressed the assembly & took for his   subject sin & the forgiveness of sin I speak upon this subject  because we are in the midst of it, it has been among all classes  it has been in our houses in our families & in our hearts and  although it has been a constant companion their is but  few that understand the Nature of sin. Many have made them-  selves miserable thinking they had sined against the Holy   Ghost. others that they had sined a great sin. But what   have the Revelations of the Lord said upon these subjects we learn  that Jesus Christ came & took a body & redeemed the world  but Lucipher rebelled was cast down without any body and  He has sought to vex & destroy the children of men. He seeks  diligently to draw all from the right path esspecially if a Saint   tries to follow the track & get whare Jesus was then the devil would  try hard to over throw them. Many have thought they have committed  much sin when they have not understood the nature & work   of sin. we must understand many principles & arive at much  knowledge before we can fully understand the Nature of Sin. The  veil of Darkness is over the Earth so that the inhabitants of the   Earth are so overwhelmed in tradition & darkness they do not  know light from darkness truth from Error wright from wrong   or the difference between the dictation of the Holy Spirit or that  conscienc which has been framed for them by the dictation  of their mothers & priests. many think far more of the   traditions of their youth than of any principle that God  could reveal from Heaven unto them. their Mothers must   not do any thing on Sunday ^to^ darn a stocking would be a great  sin, sin is one thing & tradition is another. The word of God   revealed will tell what sin is while tradition will not  The Education of the world is good as far as they have any  truth found in any science which they possess but they do not   understand truth as connected with the plan of Salvation. I   want the saints here to understand that they cannot sin against   God, & Jesus Christ & the priesthood, against his family   & the Saints then come & ask forgiveness of the church  then pass on smoothly & ^think they will^ go to Heaven this is to cheap a way   to get to Heaven I want this subject riveted on your hearts  if it is not you will not remember it. You must remember your  covenants & the Law of the Lord that is given to us. It is written   that sin is a transgression of the Law whare is it, in the Books  that is given us in the main yet this does not go into all the me-  anderings of life. whare do you find a law that you shall  not drive a team across your Neighbor lot nor go to his hay  stack or suffer your families to take liberties that you are not   willing should be done to you yet you know it to be wrong. But   do unto others as you wish others to do unto you is the Law & the  prophets. Some men who have been ordained unto the priesthood   & are vary high in Authority will take the Name of God in  vain & swear by this & that does such persons suppose that   that the Church can forgive that sin if you do your hope is vain  they can never forgive that sin. No man can do it none     
 But God alone & it never will be forgiven untill He does it  the time will come that if a man will take the name of God   in vain he will be hewn down without judgment or trial  Hear it O ye Elders, for it is time. Let this people  sanctify their hearts & then take the Name of God in vain  & they will not be forgiven the time will also come   when if the parents are scanctifyed before the Lord & their  children rise up in disobedience against them they will  be hewn down. If you sin against God & take the name   of God in vain if you get forgiveness it will have to be forgiven  by Him & not from man. some think if they are alone  & sware or sin nobody will know it but they will find   themselves mistaken still if a man has to sware let   him be alone if a man damns himself let him be alone  that others may not be polluted by his sin. If you take   the name of God in vain I will not forgive ^it,^ for I cannot  if the Lord will forgive you I will forgive you for maring  my feelings by speaking it in my ears the more you   see the veil parted & the more you learn the more you will see Gods  ways are not as our ways this people are passing through a great   school of experiance I remember while in Kirtland if any of the  Brethren felt their rights infringed upon in any wise or abused would  retaliate & be ready to quarrel about it & be ready to get up a law suit  for ^a debt of^ three dollars but the minds of the saints have become more noble  Now if a man is abused who understands principle he is above quar-  reling about it and he feels to say it is nothing to me I am not to suffer  by it but you that have abused me has the penalty to pay. But   if the devivel can ownly make you think that you are abused or   ill treated and you begin to fret about it and you give the devil  power ^over^ you & in the end it is as bad as though you had done wrong yourself  Now if a man sins against you untill seventy times seven & he repents   & with an humble heart asks forgiveness you should forgive him   for this is the law & the prophets He must ask forgiveness & be humble  or he cannot be forgiven. As much has been said & many fears  entertained by many concerning the sin against the Holy Ghost I will   speak further concerning that subject to sin against the Holy   Ghost is a sin against God the Father the Son & the Holy Ghost that   bears record of them. A man cannot sin against the Holy Ghost   untill the Holy Ghost has revealed unto him the Father & Son &  a knowledge of Eternal things in a great degree degree  when he has a knowledge of these things with his eyes open he   rebels against God & defys his power He sins against all things  if a man does sin against the Holy Ghost the people have nothing   to do with it for they cannot forgive that sin & none but God  can do it & probably He will not in this world nor the world to  come for they become sons of perdition & probably will never  repent of [their sin] or have a disposition to.      If you blaspheme the Name   of God dont ask this people to forgive you for they cannot do it  you may ask them to pray God to forgive you. If God does  forgive the sin then you can go down into the waters of baptism  when you get knowledge you will be ashamed to sin      Now I want to bring this subject home what are the acts of the people  do they not sin & trespass against their Brethren Parrents against   their children & children against their parents the husband against   the wife & wife against the husband this is with us & this we     
 can reach & manage & tell what ought to be done you ought  to cease from taking the liberty of any person but do unto all as you  would wish them to do unto you infringe upon the rights of no  one Borrow no tool but what you will return according to promise  take no wood nor any thing els but what belongs to you and if you   find any thing that is not your own do not hide it away but   report it that the owner may be found. If I had some stones  here in my hand I could cast them & hit twor or three in this  congregation in the head who are guilty of these acts you may say   why dont you tell who they are why you poor Devil are you not  going to repent of it by & by. If not when the day of clensing & santi  fying of Israels comes you will have to be sacraficed & your blood  spilt upon the ground for the day will come when iniquity must  scease in Zion and the Profane man who takes the Name of God  in vain will be slain.      In the days of Ancient Israel Justice  was dealt out in a manner that showed they understood principle &  revered the commands of God. it was a mercy to many to have  Justice & Judgment executed upon them on the Earth even to  be slain & have their blood poured out upon the Earth that it   might be tolerable for them God made a Covenant with  Abraham & his seed that He would save them when they  commit sin He slew them that He might save them by   their spilling their blood as an offering. Had they have lived  in sin they might have sinned so as not to have been forgiven  or saved. it was a mercy to slay them. Now Brethren if   you sin against God go to God to get forgiveness if that sin is  not unto death their is a sin unto death which we were told we  need not pray for. if you sin against your Brother go to him   to get forgivness ask forgiveness at the hands of the inocent  if you sin against your family your parents your husband your   wife your childrn seek forgiveness at their hands but what  is done in secret should be forgiven in secret & go no further  that sins may be hid. But if sins are committed openly they  should ask forgiveness & be forgiven openly these are true  principles & let them be rememberd forever      Govornor B. Youngs address before the legislative  assembly of the Territory of Utah upon slavery  He remarked that the whole world were slaves Eve partook  of the forbidden fruit & also Adam & it brought slavery   upon all their posteriy in some way or other & thi[s] will  continue untill we become righteous enough to drive   the devil & evil from the Earth. Adam had two   sons Kane & Abel. KCain was more given to evil than   Abel Adam was called to offer secrifice also his sons the   sacrifice of Abel was more acceptable than Canes & Cane  took it into his heart to put Abel out of the way so he   killed Abel the Lord said I will not kill Cane but I  will put a mark upon him and it is seen in the face  of every Negro on the Earth and it is the decree of  God that that mark shall remain upon the seed of Cane  & the Curse untill all the seed of Abel should be redeemed  and Cane will not receive the priesthood untill or   salvation untill all the seed of Abel are redeemed  any man having one drop of the seed of Cane in him     
 in him cannot hold the priesthood & if no   other Prothet ever spake it before I will say it  now in the name of Jesus Christ I know it is true  & they know it the Negro cannot hold one particle  of Government but the day will come when all the  seed of Cane will be Redeemed & have all the blessings  we have now & a great deal more but the seed of  Abel will be ahead of the seed of Cane to all Eternity  let me consent to day to mingle my seed with the  seed of Cane it would bring the same curse upon me  and it would upon any man and if any man mingl  his seed with the seed of Cane the ownly way he could  get red of it or have salvation would be to come forward   & have his head cut off & spill his blood upon the ground  it would also take the life of his Children It is said if  a man kills another that he takes that that he cannot give  if a mans head is cut off his life is not destroyed or his   spirit that lives, his tabernacle is destroyed but I can  make as good tabernacles as I can destroy if you do not  believe it look at my Children. Much blood was   shed in ancient days both of man & beast the firstlings  & best of the flock was sacrafized on the Altar & in   some instances many men & almost whole Nations was  sacraficed or put to death because of their sins & wickednes  this was the ownly way they could be saved at all  if Jesus Christ had not had his blood shed the blood  that He received from his Mother Mary the world   would not have been saved. Their is not one of the seed  of old Cane that is permitted to rule & reign over   the seed of Abel and you nor I cannot help it  Those that do bear rule should do it in righteousness  I am opposed to the present system of slavery  the Negro should serve the seed of Abram but it  should be done right dont abuse the Negro & treat  him cruel. It has been argued here that many of   the Jews were black. Whenever the seed of Judah   mingled with the seed of Cane they lost their  priesthood & all blessings. as an ensample let the   Presidency, Twelve, Seventies, High Priest Bishops  & all the Authorities say now We will all go & mingle  witth the seed of Cane and they may have all the privileg  they want we lift our hands to heaven in support of   this that moment we loose the pristhood & all blessings  & we would not be redeemed untill Cane was. I   will never admit of it for a moment some may think  I dont know as much as they do but I know that I  know more than they do. the Lord will watch us all the time  the Devil would like to rule part of the time but I am   determin He shall not rule at all and Negros shall   not rule us. I will not admit of the Devil ruling at   all I will not consent for the seed of Cane to   vote for me or my Brethren if you want to know  why we did not speak of it in the Constitution   it was because it was none of their business     
 any man is a Citizens Black white or red and if  the Jews come here with a part of the Canaanite  blood in them they are Citizens & shall have their  rights but not to rule for me or my Brethren  those persons from the Islands & foreign countries  know nothing about governing the people. The Canaan  ite cannot have wisdom to do things as the white man  has. We must guard against all Evil I am not going  to let this people damn themselves as long as I can   help it      February 8, 1852 ~ Sunday      Sunday Feb 8 President Young addressed the assembly   and said I trust in the Lord for light as I have   heretofore done when the minds of men are open   to understand they will see things as they are. we are  subject to all the evils which are in the world. I have  thought this world as fallen as any of the creations   of God. when the Lord created the Earth or any world   if they have an Exaltation they will have to experine   all that we Experiane I see no reason why they   should not be tempted as we are tempted. If we  are candidates to exhaltation & glory & that we cann  ot get that Exaltations & glory in no other way then  we should be reconciled to it & be satisfyed to let the Lord  do with us as He pleases is their any Evil upon any pe  person or affliction upon any Nation or kingdom   that God does not permit their is not we should  then be faithful to God in all things to be his   secret counsellor if necessary why should we com-  plain or find fault with God about any thing we   should not. Se the Example of the Nations of the  Earth they complain about evry thing and against all  his providences their is no proceding of ours or act or ex  periance but what He knows all about. If it would  be any satisfaction to you I would say that God has  passed through all the trials & experience that we have  Jesus Christ has passed through all the trials & experine  the same as we have it would not be prudent for  me to say that the Father has not the same experiene  that his Son had. He had quite as much as his Son  had, let the Saints look about themselves & se if  they hadve as great things as they expected when  they first received the gospel & the Holy Ghost opened  their minds they saw that Zion was to [be] built up &   Israel gatherd the power of God & the Holy Ghost to be  poured out upon us. If we could get a place by ourseles  how faithful we would live & thank God. Do you have   the same things you looked for well I dont know you say this  shows that somebody has let down their watch & inf-  luenced others & they have not lived up to their privileges  when we first received the gospel we were humble  but since the tempteor has come & we are tempted with  many things but this is right the Lord permits it  we could not get glory without it let me ask if any     
 one is here who went to Jackson County in 1831   The feeling was If I could get with the Saints all   my sorrow & trouble would be at an End so it is   with the Saints in England. Before we preached   the gathering to them the lord revealed to them that   they would be gathered we told them not to reveal   it untill the time came do you have any thing now   that you looked for in the begining if not sumthing is   the matter you dont do right you dont settle this   difficulty or that but what is the matter you are wrog   yourself what henders you from praying all day &   fasting and prayer you have enough to eat but the   great difficulty is when they moved to Zion they   brought themselves with them you had so many devels   in you that they trouble you. when the devel & wicked   men have afflicted & persecuted us as far as is for our   good then the Lord says stop & go no further they are held   up but if we take evry thing patiently all our afflictions  will work together for our good. But do you at the present   time have any thing to mar your peace except what you   bring upon yourselves you have privileges here but do   the people prize their privileges why do the people go to   the kanyons after wood on Sunday why have they gone   today why dont I do it why do I not visit my farm   the Bath House on Sunday because it is not right & sets   a bad example I cannot do these things on the   Sabbath Some will take poles of[f] from his Neighbors farm   take a chain or an ax without liberty this is wrong  their is nothing on Earth to mar our peace but owur   own acts but the great difficulty is they cannot get  away from themselves. they think perhaps if they   go to the gold digings they can get away from themselves  but they cannot. When persecution & trials come   they search the good seed and it dries up. How are you   going to get Zion nothing henders our having Zions   but ourselves we have all the privileges of Angels to   worship God & get all blessings we need. we mean   to war with all Devils temptations & trials untill we   overcome I will fight untill I overcome if I fall   in the grave their is others who will take my place  their are many who will fight & if it needs be we  will take the sword I hope all who want good principles   will have the privilege of receiveing them to day is a day of   tithing & sacrafice tomorrow cometh the burning I would say   that you cannot be perfect without me nor I without you   the providences of God has so interwoven & identifyed   the interest of the Children of Adam together that they   cannot be perfect without each other do you enjoy your-  selves & have peace. I have peace & no man can take it frm   me if you do not have peace it is because you drive stakes   & the Lord will not let you do it but let the will of God   be done if you dont Enjoy Zion it is because you dont say   let the will of God be done their is nothing to take your   Zion away but yourselves we are to be tryed & tempted     
 in evry way in order to prove ourselves the friend of God   in all things & God will bless you my prayer is that God  will bless this people & that they may be faithful and   a friend to God. I told the Legislature that I would be proud   to have the world know that I told the assembly to fast   & pray untill they get the spirit of God to do their duty   I would like to see the Judges upon the bench to ask God to   bless them and all the Jury & witnesses to assist them   in all their testimony & decissions      March 1, 1852 ~ Monday      Monday March 1st 1852 This is again my birth day   I am 45 years of age this day the Lord hath preserved  me thus far in life I pray that He may still preserve me   and lengthen out my days to behold the work of the Lord   on the Earth & to assist in carrying on that work I spent   the day with the Legislature      March 2, 1852 ~ Tuesday to March 3, 1852 ~ Wednesday      2 & 3 I spent the time with the Legislature it was a vary   busy time with us As we were about to close The members   of the Joint session concluded to have a day of recreation   feasting & rejoiceing on the morrow      March 4, 1852 ~ Thursday      4th Thursday The Govornor President of the Council   [FIGURE] Speaker of the house with all the members of   both branches of the Legislature assembled with   their ladies at the Council House & Legislative Hall & partok   of an exellent fest and had an excellent social party   {We all went forth in a dance} The Govornor gave an interesting   address in the evening which closed with a shout of Hosannah   All returned home satisfied with the procedings of the day      March 5, 1852 ~ Friday      5th Both Houses met in Joint Session this morn   and spent a busy day      March 6, 1852 ~ Saturday      6th Saturday Both Houses met in Joint Session   and closed up all the business of the Session   and adjourned untill next December the Govorn   blessed the assembly and the President of the counsel  & Speaker of the House returned thanks to the master   The Assembly returned a vote of thanks to the Govorn   and all returned their homes I spent the evening in   school learning Fonography      March 7, 1852 ~ Sunday      7th Sunday I preached in the school House in the   13 ward visited Brother Hardy in the Afternoon & foud   Charles Hardy was fast sinking with the Consumption He   will not live long.

April 5, 1852 ~ Monday      5th Br & Sister young nailed on the Cushion to the Tabernacle   stand I spent the day at home writing      April 6, 1852 ~ Tuesday      April 6th 1852 The general Conference of   the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints   met in the New Tabernacle built on the Temple Block   in the city of the Great Salt Lake on this 6th day of   April      There was present B Young H. C. Kimball &   W Richards who compose the first Presidency   O Pratt W. Woodruff & G A Smith of the Twelve Apostles   Also the Patriarchs John Smith & Isaac Morley   The president of the Stake D Spencer   The Presidents of the several quorums  The Tabernacle was filled to overflowing in an   hour after the doors were open & hundreds could not   get into the house      The President took the stand at 10 oclok and said   we adjourned last conference to meet in the tabernacle   to day we are here in the New Tabernacle according to apoint-  ment. The Hymn was read & sung (Lord in the Morning thou   shalt Hear). The diedication Prayer was offered by  Willard Richards it was great & good is published in   the Deserett News then two Hyns were sung. The Prsidt  dent I arise to say a few words as we have offered the dedi  cation Prayer upon that subject who could foresee   the way of the Lord as we now See it we can now beho-  ld the manifestation of the Lord. He has done what we   could not have expected but we have an experience   that teaches us to trust in the Lord. we should not   undertake to dictate the Lord for his work will go on   we have seen plenty try to dictate the Lord and try to build up   themselves & not this kingdom but they soon fall and the Lord   overthrows them but this work goes on the gospel is preached   & all his work goes on let the wicked do what they please we  have the privile[ge] of worshiping God and being happy. I wish to   dedicate all I possess unto God & praise him & do all He requires   of me. At the last conference I was sick & not able to be   with you not able to be up I meditated upon the state of the     
 Church. I see some going to the right some to the left some after  gold and the riches of this life I said I would tell the  Brethren my feelings I said I would go to work &   build a Tabernacle & worship the Lord so that we  would not be driven home by a storm I saw also  that some would say I cannot go for I must take care  of my cattle my farm my fields &c but I said I would  go & worship God as long as I wished If the whole  Earth sunk. Some delight in a fine Horse farm or  House or good things ofin this life but this is nothing to   you it is good in its place. But you cannot pray because  you cannot spend time. some women cannot spend  time to have prayers you know it is your duty to pray  & dedicate yourselves to God & your family & all you  possess some feel as though they must go to night to  the canyons. But if you will harken to council you will say  to all the world Stand By I am going to worship the Lord  let the dead Bury the dead and dedicate myself & family &  all I have to the Lord. No matter whather the Lord sets  you about go at it & do it. Their is a great change with   this people we have been sick now are well have been   poor now are rich, Have been distressed & mobed now  have peace How long will it last as long as this people   do right It has been 22 years since this Church was   organized we should serve the Lord Love the Lord with   all our hearts scease to do wrong or find fault with any  of the Saints if they do wrong Chastize them & not   hate them. are the people prepared to make a covenat  to dedicate themselves & their hearts to God from   this hour I feel to urge all the Brethrn & Sisters to  dedicate themselves unto the Lord. If we can   gain the victory & say I will do the work of the Lord in  all things. If He will make his will known I will  perform it. Not ownly say but perform it dedicate our  our affections unto the Lord. we may find some that  cannot feel it, they say I want some gold or somthing  to help myself with to get out of difficulty what will   be done in such a case, I will tell you what I would do If  I had got but one cow & she plagued me I would  give her away if you have any thing that is in your way   give it away to the public works Let nothing get between  you & God and I will tell you what to do if any thing   gets between you & God give it to the service of God for  you cannot get through the gate of the Celestial City  why are you not as pure as the Church of Enoch because  you are not a mind to be I will make my hands do the will  of God & my heart will go with it. The spirit of Envy will  not obey then unite your interest with this kingdom for  this kingdom will stand forever then put your inter  est with it so that you cannot get away then you will  stick to the kingdom but if your purse of gold is in your  pocket & you Apostitize you will go away but if your interest  is in the church & [you] do wrong you may stay untill you get   the spirit of God again & may be saved we must build     
 up this kingdom first & dont be afraid of Starveing for   this kingdom will be an ever lasting Kingdom that will  not be throne down it will Stand forever the more the  wicked try to throw it down the more it will stand  if you want it to stand unite your interest with it   in such a manner that you cannot get it away  then you are safe if I was to ask what your opinion  was concerning the Millenuam I should get a   great many opinions but the truth is all will be  in one sens as it is now you will eat, build, &   do all things as now ownly you will be more pure  & united and all will serve the Lord & not the devil   any more let this people possess this spirit & Here  would be the Millenium it would be with any people  that would do that the President then blessed the people  and asked God to bless them they then sung an hym  and adjourned till 2 oclok      2 oclok PM. The House was crouded to excess  O Pratt of the Twelve Apostles addressed the Assembly  (after singing & prayer) He said I address you but not without  many reflections upon my mind. It is no small matter  to address such a sea of faces if the Lord does not  pour out his spirit upon me it will not be but a little  benefit for me to speak yet I do feel a great desire  for the Lord to give me his spirit for your sake  that you may be edifyed I feel anxious to receive  principle & the salvation of the living & dead what has   that to do with the living it has much to do with it  it is a truth revealed from Heaven that we are to be  saviors upon Mount Zion to redeem the living & the dead  this is the subject that is given to me I am determined to  trust in God who will give any man their portion in   due season the responsibility of preaching this go[s]pel   to all the world & redeem the dead we must live before   the Lord in such a manner that we can have his appro-  bation what says the Book of Mormon upon this subject  those that assist in building up Zion & shall do it by faith  shall have the blessing of the Lord upon them How will we   do it by listening to the council of the priesthood of the  Church & consecrating ourselves before God to his service  as we were told by Presidet Young we shall then have   the power of the Holy Ghost & what greater gift can we   have then this for this will teach us all things and if  a faithful man is sent abroad to any Nation to preach the  Gospel & is faithful & follows the spirit of truth He will accom  plish his mission in spite of all Earth & Hell. when  Nephi was sent back to get the plates of Brass & his  brethren would not go the Lord told Nephi that He was stro  nger than 10,000 men to go & He would deliver the plates into  his hands he went & done as the Lord told him & got the plates  look at this people our enemies told us we must go away to  the west & not stay with them untill we were driven into  the Rocky Mountains but the Hand of the Lord was in it  & the Leaders of this people were as much inspired to   come to this place as the Nephits wer to get the plates     
 we can see that the Lord caused us to accomplish   what we could not have done we see today a great mass  of Saints before us we have been sustained by the Hand  of God in all thes things. The Lord hath said I will give  you an inheritance that you shall have in time & Eternity  and Israel shall be led by the keys which I have given  we have been led into a goodly land with our good Houses  & fields of grain & all good things so their is Hardly room   enough to receive it can it be possible that any man   after seeing all the goodness of God up to this time   can have a doubt about this work being true can you   find a people that has got wisdom enough to get a revela-  tion for themselves unless God is with them this people are  willing to do all things as far as they understand the Mormons   are increasing & will incres and their is no power that will  stop the work of the Latter Day Saints. I rejoiced this   forenoon while looking upon the faces of the saints & to see the spirit of  God upon them & that their union was increasing & that they wished  to hear & learn truth He refered to a certain Revelation that said  that Zion should look upward & their Union be incresed & was  strengthened then Zion should look down from above   refering to the Zion of Enoch And that Zion would come   & the Heavens would shake with gladness & the Earth would  tremble with gladness and they will build up each other  I want to see that day come that we may see the Old Jerrus  alem Jentlemnt Adam this people will then look but small  in comparison to what will be at that time. Here are the  Twelve & seventies & thousands who will bring the gospel   to all men and Israel who are numerous will have to have  the feelings all manifested to them they must be visited  & instructed as we have been they must be gathered   as we have been we cannot be perfect without  them no more than they can be perfect without us  they all must be gathered from the fore quarters of the  Earth & be instructed together & be prepared for   the coming of the Lord is there not a prospet of  this being done yes their is as much I wish you  could have a view of the state of affairs in England  their was some 40,000 saints baptized when I left  and there was not one in 400 but what would give   all they possessed ion Earth to be set down here  many of them would be faithful if they were here  again would not the saints of the western Islands be glad  to come here they would & they will come you remember   the parable of the vineyard that the servants of the Lord   had to labour & keep the top & roots Equal so that the top  need not be to heavy for the roots if we can get a   few thousands of the Saints that we can teach & instruct  so that they will become strong in faith & works then we  wan bring in thousand of weaker ones & they get tried   the strong ones can succor them & they become strong also  & the Devil have No power over them & Zion will soon   be Esstablished & thousands upon thousands will come from  the Nations to take shelter under the tree of Liberty in the  gospel & kingdom of God from the dire calaminities of     
 of famine Pestilence & wars which will be poured out upon  the whole Earth there is sumthing els to be done to prepare   this people for coming Events Here are many of the remnant  of Joseph that have got to be felt after & redeemed I believe  the signs of the times indicate that that the time has come when   the work must commence if they are sunk in the lowest depths  of degredation yet they are the chosen seed the desendants of  Joseph who was sold into Egypt the promises are unto   them they must be redeemed could we be placed in a better  condition to commence the work than we Now are we cannot  look what way we will they are all around us and the prom-  ises of God are to be fulfilled then shall we not pray for  them let us exercise faith in their behalf & do all we can   for them. No you not they are to be the main instrumts  that will build up Zion & Her Temples and all the  Gentiles who repent shall assist the remnant of Jacob to  build up Zion & the power of Heaven will come down to Help  them. First we are to introduce the gospel to them & teach  them the principles of the Kingdom of God & give them the prie-  sthood. Do you want to see the Zion of God built up & the   Temple of the Lord reared up in this Generation upon the conse-  crated land then pray for the remnets of Joseph & their   redemption for they have to assist in gathering all the House  of Joseph & when they all get together the Heavens can no  longer be stayed but their prayers & faith will prevail  & the Heavens will come down & meet with the Saints then  be ready ye Elders of Israel to go when the Lord calls   upon you by his servants to leave all to go to preach the  gospel to them in their own language & tongue and the  power of God will rest upon you I believe the Lord   will send forth his messengers who are ordained unto this  power to go forth unto the Lamanites & will clothe them with  far greater power than when they were sent unto the   corrupt Gentiles the Lord will not come untill we go to   this people we have a portion of the power of God with us  but not in its fulness as it will be in days to come this  people will have to be tried in all things & proven & whn they  are found faithful & united they will then thrash the   Nations by the power of the spirit of God & they cannot  Help themselves      Orson Spencer then arose & made  a few remarks. Felt to rejoice in the principle that had   been presented to us they had cheered his heart & the  Hearts of this people I hope we shall improve & be faithful  for these principle are true The Lord says my people shall  be willing in the day of my power that people who have givn  the war hoop & crept through the brush find the spirit of God  & of their Father Jacob once more running through their  veins & the people who think they are almost extinguished  will find they are still alive & will fulfill all that is  said concerning them. But I must say nothing I must   Hush. I will Hush. But will God Hush & be still  No He will stir up the remnants of Joseph in his our   & in his own time. The Nations of the Earth are trying to bond  together they may do so & be prepared for the day of burning  the child will be taken care of untill He can take care of     
 Himself we are on the stage of action & we have our part   to act in this great work and I rejoice that we have a prt   in the work and that it may roll on spedily is my Prayer      April 7, 1852 ~ Wednesday      April 7th House filled at an Early hour to overflowing   conference opened at 10 ock.

Presidnt   Youg remarked that No doubt before you get home you will   hear we have committed treason.      with regard to the labour of this Tabernacle I will say the   cost will be read before the meeting and all the Tithing & outlay   but if you feel that if your Expectations are realized you should   be satisfyed I will say I never saw No one room as conven[ien]t   as this it will seat 2200 persons & their was is 2500 persons prst [present]   today. I expect the Tabernacle which we expet to build on  this Block will seat fifteen Thousand people we never did   build a House large Enough to Hold the people if we was to [illegible]   this whole 10 Acre Block so that it would hold 200,000 people   by the time we got it done their would be enogh to fill it. The   Lord is controlling our affairs & does more for us than we can     
 do for ourselves or ask him to do for us the more we are   humble & labour & prepare for the gathering of Israel the faster   they will gather the Esstablishment of this Tabernacle was   the result of my meditations while upon a sick bed      If their is any man that is full of the Holy Ghost & wishes to   speak let him rise up & speak & use his liberty I feel as   usual to praise the Lord with all my heart. The hand of   God has been as visable in leading this people as it was in   leading Israel in the days of Moses some had not faith to come   on for fear of Starveing to death. dont be in a Hurry to go  away but stay untill you have worshiped Enough at this time      Brother Kempton spoke a few moments believed this to be   the kingdom of God had No Doubt of it      Presidnt Young remarked that the Gentile would take exception   to what is said Here I know as the Lord lives that the people   of the United States have departed from the spirit & letter   of their Constitution and this people will be the ownly   the people that will sustain ^it^      G A Smith arose & said we are a singular people if we   signify that we cannot worship as other Sects do but want   to exercise our rights it is considered Treason but a   Senator from South Caralinia could rise up in the Halls   of Congress & declare that that the United States was more   tyranical than the Goverment of Austria & South Carolina   would reject the Goverment this would not be considered   treason but dont be alarmed God rules our destiny   & will rule the world & if we do our dooty their is no   power that can harm us for we will make God our ref  uge      Br Gifford spoke a few moments & bore testimony of the   work of God Had Been in the Church 21 years in June next       Wm W Phelps next followed said this was the third   time He had been to a Dedication of a House built to worship   God I was at Kirtland while the Angel of the Lord came in   & sat there During service. A Hymn was sung & adjned   till 2 ock      Met according to adjoument singing & Prayer.

But I said I would   kill any man that sought to take me many thought my  purse reached from Eternity to Eternity that there was   No End. we were Called bogus makers Brother Kimball   said we would go whare we could coin the pure gold $10   at a lick we have done so even $20 at a time Our Brethen   went to Calafornia the Hand of God was in all this they opened  the gold mines and the Lord had a Design in it to see who   would be tryed by it. Never did nor never will any of the   saints go to dig gold ther without being sent without being damned  by it mark my words if we go onto the devils ground we shall   be left to smell Hell we shall feel the wrath of God if I was   sent there by the Lord I would go but the Lord has not called     
 me to go many Elders in Israel good men have tryed   it & smutted themselves up so that it is quite a question if   they will ever be washed clean I have said I did not think   their was $1 in $20 paid in Tithing that has been spent   on the public works but it seems from the Book that   there has been about one fourth the other three fourths   I have had to borrow. If I have to borrow all the   money that is used and none assist me to pay it it will   make my head ake I have trusted the Lord & served him   all the day long and when I undertake any thing I persevere  untill I accomplish it I see the difference betwen trusting  in God & doing business according to the order of the world  their is not one hair droped from my head unnoticed   & does God not know what I want. their never was a   miracle ownly to the Ignorant. It is all to be accounted for   on Natural principles. The Lord will not turn stone & clay   into gold to suit me their is enough without it Jesus did not make   bread out of stone but He had knowledge & power & did call togethe  the Elements to make bread & the Elements into the water to make   wine & he can call the Elements together to make gold as well   as bread & wine. But the Lord is not going to work a miracle to cloth  us raise your wool & flax & spin & weave it &make it up & not   have to pay cash for evry pound you use & what you by is hardly  worth making up but what you make is strong & will wear      Brother Major spoke on Home manufacture a few momets      Wednesday Evng       The Elders filled the House at an Early Hour and was addressed by   President B. Young who arose & said this is certainly a mixed   congregation of all the Officers of the Church we are to be instruct  ed in all things. the knowledge that is now in the midst of this people is   more than in all the world besides. All sceince is in the midst of  this people even if they have not learned it as the world has. I have   my cogitations & views of the affairs of this kingdom but I have   learned that we must write work to the scribe if not we may   fail in it but if we work in faith & confidence the Lord is   apt to Help us. I asked a favor of the Bishops to divide the money   debts in Each ward, that it might be paid. Let us contend with  ourselves & disipline ourselves untill evry thing that is within us  is brought in subjection to the Law of Christ you have been  taught the first principles of the gospel now teach yourselves &   the Church. Our school is the school of the prophets this is a school   to plain & polish ourselves and suppose under such privilege we   should endulge in Evil & neglect our families & our duty to God  all our former sins would be upon our Heads it is for a man   to commit himself & all that He presides over unto God to do his will   & continue to do it untill you are sanctifyed. if your Neighbor   does you Evil do not do evil to them bear with him & set him   right but do not quarrel with him but be careful that you   conduct yourself well untill you are prepared for the society of Holy   men this is as I said the school of the Prophets Our Baptism is   ownly the begining of our work you must then go on to perfection  you must perform this work our children understand the gospel   but do they understand the way to govern their lives we will never   se a day but what we can learn we shall not inherit the glory of   God all at once or understand all knowlede but God teaches us small   principles to prepare us for greater ones Let us learn in this school 
 there is a great many Books of Education of the present day the main   main Branch of our study is Theology I understand it better than   any of the world. Adam, Enoch, Moses & Aaron, Jesus & the Apostle  have all been in the same school in their day & have faithfuly lernd   that they might be perfected. They are my Brethren & will be my   company and I now tell you if you want me to have full fellowsip  with you scease speking Evil of God & all good men whether in   Heaven or on Earth.      When a man is in the right tract he will come  & lay down any thing at the feet of a Brother to settle a difficulty   & rather wrong themselves than to have a difficulty do for the truth sake  & my sake take my councel. The people want revelating this is   Revelation [FIGURES] If you wanted Revelation written I could   write Revelation evry day about Building a Temple diging gold going   to England or any othe place I profess to be an Apostle Evry Apostle   will have to be a Revelator & have Revelations if their is thousands of  then if they do their duty & live up to thei calling if not they will   have to be removed but a man that is not an Appostle has   not power to stand at the Head of the Kingdom of God Hold the keys of   the priesthood & build up & lead the church of God the Highest Authory   on the Earth is an Apostle      Jesus Christ will have a set of men  [By] Young said with him that will follow him to the [end]   and to all that He requirs of them they will have the greater glory  but those that cannot endure these things will have a Lesser glory      G. A. Smith followed & said I want to bear my testimony   to the saints Many want a mission but let me tell you that any  man who has been baptized into this kingdom that moment he   took a mission whill will contine untill death before it closes  if we do not work in all things agreeable to the Council of the Church it   would not be right talk of paying one tenth & buying our way to Heaven  Brother Joseph wished the Seventies to subscribe as much as as a gimbl &  handle to build up the Seventies Hall if Brothr Joseph Young had the   right spirit he would not ask for such subscriptions if the Elders  was as ready to build that Hall as they would be to go on a missin   they would rise up & do it right off & the quicker you commence  to build the quicker it will be finished & such a Hall will be worth   5 times the amount of personal property make your large farms large   large Houses & Have spare Rooms & neglect public Building it would be   a loss you may work yourself almost to death and then be   called away at a momets warning I was called to go to Iron   County. Some Elders that was called to go on that Mission sent   gold diggers to go in their place & fill the mission for them I   never thought of leaveing a mission that was given me untill   that mission was closhed closed up many worked all winter  to build & put in grain then Left it in the spring & go home. Our   Mormon News is our paper. we should sustain it. we are neglecting  the Education of our Children. knowledge is power the Lord will   help those who help themselves. the English by the knowledge they possessed   conquered 200,000000 of people & brought them in subjection to there own  Laws what we learn we shall carry with him us the mobs   will burn our homes & destroyed our property but they cannot   burn or destroy the knowlede of our hearts. we should keep   the Sabbath it is not right to spend this day in Hunting cattle &  labouring but should spend the time in the worship of God & we should  improve each leasure momet in treasureing up knowledge if we     
 could lay up one Idea each day for a year we should have a   store of knowledge that no man could exhaust in a speech of three   hours in length and the wicked could not stand before you. the   most learned man of the day is Burrett A Blacksmith He was a   self learned & made man pay attention to this Brethn & improve you   by it we now have the privilege of speaking in one of the Best Halls   in the world thak God Amen Zera Pulsipher spoke & bore testimy of the work      April 8, 1852 ~ Thursday      Thursday 8th House filled at 9 oclok Meeting opened by Prayer   by Wilford Woodruff who also addressed the Assembly spoke in   sum measure upon the subjet of Education He said we are comm-  issioned to preach the gospel to all the world & stand before kings &   rulers it is our duty to store our minds with knowledge learning   & wisdom that we may be qualifyed to stand before all men the Lord   has called upon this people & ordained them to preach the gospel & make war   upon the powers of darkness & continue that warfare untill the Earth is   redeemed & the name of God honored am[on]g men who should spend all   of his life in preaching the gospel & should ownly bring in one man into the kingdo   of God who should be saved with an Everlasting salvation that man would have   cause to rejoice through all Eternity over the redemption of that one   Soul & if He brings ^m^any souls into the kingdom of God His Joy will be still   greater. The warfare of the saints is great in the Earth in this dispensa  tion & we should all take hold of it with a determination to conquer   & never scease untill our warfare is accomplished and evry man   will be satisfyed with his reward in the End. many other remarks   were made by the speaker who soon gave way for Orson Spencer   the chancellor of the Deseret University who delivered an address upon   Education      Orson Spencer Delivered an address upon the subject   of Education which he read from his manuscript which I suppos   will be published in the Deseret News so I did not report it      Judge Z Snow made a few remarks & said if a woman was an Educated   & Exalted minded persons she would teach good principles to her   children A person without any Education would be as ignorant as   the unborn child for whatever knowledge a person did possess he got   it by some kind of Education. Some think that Education consists   soleley in teaching Elementary Braches it may consist in farming or   any persuit of life. We have got to create all we have out of the   Elemets aroud us & we want to learn how to do it we   must manufactur all we use for if we get any thing from   the States we will have to pay High for it. if not bring us into   Slavery by it therefore we must lay a plan to beat our Enemies   or they will beat us      W W Phelps followed with some remarks      President Young next followed & said the subject I aim   at is to Enlighten the mind it is expected we have to learn   letters with regard to the principle of Education it commen  ces with the mothers I do not like to see Mothers attend to every   thing Els but their children they should teach their childr[en]   all they can for Early impressionn will last persons throgh   life whether they be good or bad I will tel you the truth as it   is in Eternity if the child does not have good instruction   in Early life it will be required at the Hand of the Mother   & not at the hand of the Mother ^Father^     
 the Child will think the mother is the best woman on Earth   & the mother has power to instill into the mind of the child   what they please, & what the Mother imparts unto them will   stay with them through life the Mother should take [care] of the   children & not spend their time watching the Husband   it is the duty of Mothers to Stay at home & take care of the   children. My duty calls me to be in this Stand I know not   what my children are about or what they are doing they may   be in the Streets swareing what I know as others do if they   should go to Hell it would be required at the Hands of the   Mother & not at my hands A Child of mine shall not   conquer me I would sooner see them die than that they   should conquer me. If any one of my Children will   not follow my footsteps I will disinherit & disown them   they shall not have part in my kingdom I would rather   get children adopted to me that will keep the command  ments. No child should rise up & teach & controll the Mother   Or woman should ^not^ rise up & dictate the Husband and the Husband   should not rise up & try to dictate His president or the Lord  In speaking of the English Language he said it was vary   incorrect He would not adopt it any more than he would the   Methodist disipline.      Education begins with the Mother to   the Child you must keep it in rememberane that the Lord   has commanded you to multiply & replenish the Earth   that you may have Joy & rejoiceing in the day of the Holy   Resurrection do you keep your minds pure & do you prey   night & day now pray from the time of conception till   the time of Delivery that your child may be filled with   [FIGURE] the Holy Ghost & that a Noble Spirit from Eternity   may come into the tabernacle & that the Holy Ghost   may rest upon the Father Mother & child often when   some speak you cannot understand they make use of such   High flown words but when I speak you can understand   for I speak to you understanding. the variety in the English   Language I would like to be with the Holy Ones who are   full of Eternal light. A point of the finger or motion   would communicate without words when I am full   of the Holy Ghost I can se a man as well behind me as  before I can see their hearts by the spirit of God & know   what is in them. Adjourned till 1 oclok      Met according to adjournet at 1 oclok President Young arose &   said red a Hymn which was sung. Prayer offered      H. C. Kimball then arose & said I wish to speak to the underst  andings of the people I never saw any room like this on Earth  the cock pit in Preston is some like it I am satisfyed that We   cannot build fast Enough to accomodate the People. Presidet   Young teachings are sweeter than the best morsel I ever tasted  if we are faithful in keeping the commandmts of God you will never   fall in battle but will be preserved to finish your work on Earth   Other intersting remaks were made by Brother kimball. Volenteers   were then kalled for to go with their teams to meet the Emigrats   100 was kalled for 88 names were taken who volunteered.   Some men were then appointed to go on Foreign Missions   as follows     
 Thomas Margaretts to Italy. T B, Bube Broderick   John Dolley, John Armstrong to England George Parmon to the   nations Wm Fatheringham go to Calcuty. Edward Stephen  son to Giberalter. James Dilly & two others go to Scotland   Alfred A Smith go on a Foreign Mission. Meeting was then Adjned   so the 70 could have the Room at 4 ock      The Seventies held a meeting & was addressed By Joseph Young   G. A. Smith W Woodruff & others conc[ern]ing buildings the 70 Halls   & other matters      April 9, 1852 ~ Friday      Friday 9th snow storm in the morning House   Filled & meeting commened at 9 oclok After Prayer the people   were addresed By Phineas Young who exhorted the people & spoke   many good things      President Brigham Young said this people   are blessed with all that Heart can wish and yet many  are not satisfyed this is the case with smome some spirits & they   want things illegally but is it not necessary that we should   have a Temple it is absolutely necessary that we should have a   Temple to worship the Most High God in. A Tabernacle is to   assemble the Multitude for meetings but a Temple is to gather the   priesthood in that they may do the work of the Lord are   we prepared to go & redeem our dead is their a place prepared   to go & Redeem our dead No their is not we give Endowmets   Here but it is like trying to step on the top round first. if we   had the privilege of steping on building a Temple our works   would not be legal but we do these things untill we have time   to build a temple if we had gone onto the top of the mountains   if we had no room it would be legal & right Brothe Kimball   says we have to make our own heaven. The Lord cannot   save us if we do not save ourselves. if we expect to get ourselves   Endowmets we have got to follow the footsteps that God has set for   us to walk in & if we walk in that Channel God own our labours   & acknowledges all that is done. Now all the ordinances will  have to be attended to again when we get a temple yet if any   one dies in the faith those ordinances will be legal but all   that live will have to do it again And I want to say as a   Revelation that if you will not help build a Temple & have  faith in the work you will be lost a word to those who   have got their Endowments we shall work as fast as   we can and what we have done is legal if we had been   in own land & had a right to a Temple we should not do as we now   do many [who] have died in the faith have been worn out ther   ordinaces are legal. Those who came in the church first &   are faithful have a right to the ordinances first. I wish   the people to understand that when the People Lord has   any thing for them they will have it but when the   Lord has Nothing for the people I dont wish them   to teaze me for what they cannot have. when their   is to be a work done I will tell you. Now we shall begin   to build a Temple in 1853. This Tabernacle will have to   accomodate the people untill the Temple is built. if this wont   answer for the people untill we build a Temple we will make   a Bowery on the North & South sides of the Block as soon   as the Temple is built we will give you your Endowments     
 if their is any who was in Jackson County & other places   & have helped to build up the kingdom of God in the   early days we want to bless them first & if their is any   man or child who went in the Battalion or in  the Pioneers come forward & get your blessings before  others & we will bless you if you are faithful their   is no blessing in the Celestial Law or kingdom of God but   what you will get I want to be sealed to my Father before   I shall be a legal heir. If I was to die & their was not a   child of mine to live to do it for me Some Friend would be  raised up to do it for me if not my Body will soon be raised   up and I would be in some temple with my Brethren to   tell them what to do I can see the Hearts of man & the Spirits of   of men if they do triy to be hid I can see them I see many  who asspire to be the first & to be exhalted above their fellows  but I can tell you all you will be rewarded according  to what you do whether you do little or much or nothing   at all some wish to be above Brother Brigham why was I not   called before Brother Brigham Joseph why does not some   one ask the Lord to appoint them to be above Brother Brigham  but the Lord will laugh at you such forget the kingdom of God   they are corrupt let evry man say what can I do to build up  the kingdom of God Ask the Mother who is trying to do the will   of God what her reward will be they will say I dont know I   will say if you are faithful & satisfied with your condition in   this life and you will be blessed & satisfyed with your conditon  in the world to come let evry one strive to be satisfyed   with their condition in life & that will be a blessing to them  we are in debt & we can pay those debts in oxen now   we want to have the Brethren turn out some oxen to pay   those debts &c      Elder Banks followed in some interesting   remarks & said the spirit of God was burning like a fire   in his bones I dont ask Brother Young to say that the  Lord has sent him & that he must say this or that in the name   of the Lord I dont belive that any man has made a sacrific   for this kingdom for all that a man does he gets his   reward for not ownly in this world but in the word to come   Eternal life. it is distressing to hear men say they want  the president to get a Revelation in order to do this or that   his council to me is sufficient. I also hear men say that  we are the off scourings of the Earth it is a great burlesk on  the Church & kingdom of God for you are the greatest people   & the most blessed of any on Earth you have power to teach  kings & princes & potentates of the Earth tremble. I have seen   a man that had learned but 3 letters & forgotten 2 of them   was ignorant yet he made a learned Doctor fear & tremble &  leave the House this people are a wonderful people there are none   like them I have herd the Presidet say that instead of our   being called to pay one tenth we should be healed as Tithing & end   all we possess be ready to help build up the kingdom of God the spirt   of God is w with this people      Brother John Young next   addressed the assemble & bore Testimony tha Joseph Smith   was a prophet of God tha Brigham Yog H.

 instead of being heirs according to promise. the pristhood is   eternal without the begining of days or end of life as the Apostle   has expressed it but man through aposticy which is entire disobedi-  ance has lost or suffered the keys & privileges of the Priesthood   to be taken away from them & they left to wander in darkness   and practice all manner of wickedness untill thousands became the   vessals of wrath & were doomed to destruction for as long as men  are without the Priesthood they continue to wander from God   & never retrace their steps untill it is done by the priesthood, & the   Idea of the Saints being led by fals Prophets is just a notion accor-  ding to the light in which they view them all the fals prophets we   have are men who have turned aside from the truth.      The man is the head & God of the woman, but let him act like a   God in virteous principles & God like conversation, walk and   deportment & such men will continue to gain influence & power   and advance in glory to all eternity. But should they use there   power in wickedness as a tyrant they soon will be called to   render an account of their stewardship. if not found worthy   they will be hurled down to perdition & their family & kingdom   be given to another that is more worthy. Some say that a   woman cannot be saved without a man, neither can a man   without a woman. Br Joseph said he had taught the Twelve   all that he knew concerning the order of the kingdom but the   difficulty was they could not remember it as he told them, but   when it was necessary they would not be at a loss for under-  standing; & I bear record to the truth of his word before God   this day that I always had an understanding & evry thing   was brought to my mind just as he taught them to us. All the   ordinances of the Temple & building of the Alter &c. came to me just   right when they were to be attended to & could we now know   Br Hyde, Pratt & Taylor's feelings you would say that they could   read a man through as soon as they cast there eyes upon him.  The Apostle Paul while speaking of the Fathers & the Ancients   said that thay without us could not be made perfect there   was a lack in his day & still will be to all eternity untill the   chain of that Priesthood is restored & evry spirit take a taber-  nacle that was fore ordained according to the dispensation of the   will of God. I am entitled to the Keys of the Priesthood   according to linage & blood, so is Brother H. C. Kimball & many others   have taken Kingly power & grades of the Priesthood. this we   would have taught in the Temple if time had permitted.   Joseph Smith was entitled to the Keys of the Priesthood according   to blood still he was the fourth son. But when we get anot[h]er   Temple built then we will teach you concerning these things  suffice it to say that I will extend the chain of the Prist-  hood back through the Apostolic dispensation to Father Adam   just as soon as I can get a temple built. Jesus could have   restored the order of the Pristhood in his day & brought in   the Millenium if the people would have harkened to his inst-  ructions but they rebelled & would not, & it was for this   cause that Jesus told them that all the blood that had been   shed from righteous Abel down to Zechariah the Prophet should   be required at there hands.      I have a request to make of my family & that is that they   (esspecially old people) omit calling me their Father. Call   me Brother Brigham. I shall feel better when you do     
 for I do not consider that I am worthy of that appelation  Father in the Priesthood implies the great head, the term   would be proper to Father Adam. Jesus had reference   to the same thing when He told his deciples not to call any   man Father on earth for their Father was in heaven.  The seal of the covenant that I have been speaking off   to day was what the Apostle saw previous to the destruction   of the wicked when the Angel was commanded not to fear pour   out the vials of wrath on the wicked untill the saints were sealed   in thereir forehead & when this was done they all became Father  Adams family. Those that are adopted into my family & take me   for their councellor if I continue faithful I will preside over  them throughout all Eternity. I will stand at their head, and   Joseph will stand at the head of this Church & will be there   President Prophet & God to the People in this dispensation. when   we Locate I will settle my family down in the order & teach them   there duty they will then have to provide temporal blessings for   me instead of my boarding from 40 to 50 persons as I now   do. I will administer in spiritual blessings to them. I expect to   live in the house of the Lord & recieve & administer ordinan-  ces to my brethren & for the dead all the year round.      President H. C. Kimball arose & addressed the meeting at some   moments. Bore testimony that what President Young had   said was true & rejoiced to meet with them &c.  Br O. Pratt also addressd the meeting a few moments  bore testimony to the truth & also rejoiced to meet with  them. There was then an intermission untill after supper  The table was well furnished & supplyed. 40 persons could   be seated at the Table at a time. the men were seated to the   right with there companion oposite them. commencing with the   Twelve President Young at there head. then in order the adopted   children begining with the 1st that was adopted. the band   & choir kept their seats, & continued there sweet strains of music   while the guest were partaking of the rich festival. While at the   table Brother Thomas Wolsay & John ^H.^ Tippets entered the   house they came direct fromt the from the Mormon Battalion   280 miles south of Santa fe on the River Riogrand on the 10th   of Nov 1847. they piloted 56 sick men to Fort Purbolo whare   Capt Brown esstablishment were stationed from there   came in on Pack Mules were 50 days on the way. were taken   prisoners twice by the Indians, once was sentenceed to death   by the Pawnees were 30 days without bread & 5 days witho  ut much of any thing to eat. Brought a package of 137 letters  brought good account from fort Purbulow but rather   unfavorable from the Battalion their faces were covered with   hair & there persons resembled a mountaineer. it was a   miracle that the lives of the men were saved from the   Indians & cold. They were seated to the table in the   guarbd they arived in. their arival produced no small stir  through the camp. men & women came in all directions   to enquire after there friends in the Armey. After the men   were refreshed we went into council with them & they rehears  ed the situation of the Battallion that they had been on   half rations for three weeks when they left them & no pro[sp]- [page torn]  ects of more than half rations should they attempt to cross [the] [page torn]  mountains this winter. However report reached Sant[a fe] [page torn]     
 they arived that the Battalion had taken the Alpasio a strong   hold between the Riogrand and the Mountains without the  fireing of a gun. if this report is true the Bat[talion] will have an   abundance of support & likely take up winter quarters  many other remarks were made & President Young said that   if they had harkened to his council not a man of them would   have fallen but would have returned to their friends in   perfect safety.      At 7 oclok we returned to the Council   House. found the Saints rejoicing in what had heard through   the day. Elder Isaac Morley said that his soul was filled   with rejoicing to see the beauty & harmony of the family   connecting links of the Priesthood that had been taught   this day: And when I look at the family connexion   I cannot but acknowledge him my leader in all things   & he looking to Joseph the Martered Prophet who has gone   to prepare the way for us, and can do more for us than   he could do if he was here. This Pristhood spoken off   if from all Eternity & will lead to eternity & will exhalt   the Saints to be Gods through faithfulness.      President Young arose & continued his remarks upon the   law of adoption granted the brethren the privilege of asking   questions when they did not fully comprehend his meaning  The Lord introduced the law of adoption for the benefit of the   children of men as a school master to bring them back into the   covenant of the Priesthood. This Principle I am aware is   not clearly understood by many of the Elders in this Church   at the present time as it will here after be: And I confess that   I have had ownly a smattering of those things but when it   is necessary I will attain to more knowledge on the subject   & consequently will be enabled to teach & practice more and  will in the mean time glorify God the bountiful giver.  I have heard Elders say they were not dependant upon any   man, I then considerd & do now that it was saying more   than I can say, for I consider that we are all dependant   one upon another for our exhaltation & that our interest  is inseperably connected. (for example) what can my family  do without me supposing they were to all turn away from me  I hold the Keys over them through which they are to receive  there exhaltation. would they would not be like sheep without   a shepherd & would be devoured by the wolves, they certainly   would. then let us change the position, & say that I would   cut off all my family, then what glory would I have with no  body to rule over but my own dear little self. To tell you my feelings   I would rather be annihilated than to be in that situation. This  is another strong proof of the Apostles saying when they declaired   that they without us could not be made perfect. Neither can   you without me nor I without you be made perfect ie if we   are faithful & without faithfulness there is no perfection on any   consideration. This rule applyes to the whole human family.   This is the torment & misery of the disobedient spirits that they   cannot be made perfect, unless some scheme should hereafter   be introduced for their redemption. they are now without tabernacles   to dwell in ownly such as they have taken possession off unlawfully   [page torn] usurped power over. it being a part of their agency that was   [page torn] [bes]towed them which they used to the consumation of there unhappy   [page torn] [w]retched estate, it being the reward & fruits of there doings     
 having been given over to all manner of wickedness perm-  itted to afflict the handy work of the Lord untill they  fill up the cup of their iniquity & the Lord sayeth unto   them thou wicked & disobedient spirit thou shalt not have   power any longer to afflict my people or destroy the   works of my hands, you have forfeited your agency &   wrought thy fulness, depart hence to the pit that I have   prepared for thee, & this is there torment, that thereir power   & agency is taken away. they are left to regret that it was  through their own disobediance that they cut the thread of   there own salvation: the reflections of which ownly serve to   torture & increase there torment & that would be the situation   of my family should they cut themselves off from me. I use   my family for an example, not that I have the least fears   of their ever doing so, for I have none. I feel happy this   night because we are of one mind, still should I believe that we   were perfect & could not advance any further I should not be happy   but to the honor power & glory of the faithful there is no end.  For your satisfaction I will show you a rule by which you may   comprehend the exhaltation of the faithful. I will use myself   as a figure, & say that I am ruling over 10 sons or subjects  [page torn] [o]wnly & soon each one of them would have 10 men sealed   to them & they would be ruler over them & that would   make me ruler over 10 Presidents or Kings whareas I was   [page torn] [r]uler over 10 subjects ownly or in other words I ruled  over one Kingdom but now I rule over 10. then let each   one get 10 more then I would be ruler over 100 Kingdoms  & so on continued to all eternity & the more honor & glory that  I could bestow upon my sons the more it would add to my   exhaltations. but to clip the thread of your exhaltation then   whare would be your your glory: it would be like the fallen   angels or devils that kept not their first esstate but were reserved  in everlasting chains of darkness unto the judgment of the great   day others fell from heaven were thrust down to hell;   but if wyou wish to advance hold up the hands of your file   leader & boast him a head. should you have ten legions of   trains following on after you, you should say to your file  leader push ahead for I am coming with my train boosting   him up at the same time instead of trying to pass by him  this would stimulate him & he would say come on my  boys I will travel as fast as you can & on we would go in   one solid train to all Eternity. Before I close I will answer   one question that has been asked me repetedly. Should I   [page covered] h[av]e a father dead that has never herd this gospel, would   it [page covered] [b]e required of me to redeem him & have him adopted  to some mans family and I be adopted unto my Father  answer No. If we have to attend the ordinances of rede-  [page torn] [m]ption for our dead relatives we then become their saviors   [page torn] [&] were we to wait to redeem our dead relatives before we   [page torn] c[o]uld link the chain of the Priesthood we would never  [page torn] [a]ccomplish it. Many other remarks were made & while   [page torn] [a]ddressing the females said Sisters if you expect to call me   [page torn] Br Brigham I want you to be cleanly keep your faces, hands  [page torn] [&] skin clean from head to foot your clothes dishes & houses   [page torn] [cl]ean also your children & teach them manners. & when   [page torn] [y]ou mix up Bread dont have a dozen flies in your tray     
 I know that the women generally rule there husbands   & the children their Mothers. But when a woman under-  takes to rule me I want her to be so secret about it that I   cannot catch her at it. Now I do not want the brethren  from my remarks to abuse thereir wives, but treat them   kindly: do there heavy luging but dont wash there dishes   as some men do. At the close of the remarks there was a   little exercise by music & dancing & the meeting was dismised      February 17, 1847 ~ Wednesday      17th The family meeting of President Young met again to   day but Br Young himself spent an exceding sick day  was taken in the night & suffered much.

 It is the most singular river I ever beheld. it is from   a quarter to half a mile wide & its shores & bed one universall   body of quick sand it is a rapid stream yet many places   a person can wade across it frequently nearly the whole   bed of the river is covered with but few inches of water   & at other places it is deep & rapid not withstanding   it is quick sand horses & cattle can walk down to edge   of the river & drink like walking on the edge of a smooth   sea beach & some times while walking on the apparent   hard beach or bed of the river a man or horse will sudd-  enly sink into the quick sand & the more he struggles   to get out the more he will sink & will soon perish of  assistance is not near, whare many horses & men have   been lost in this way on the Platt. whare we have   spent the Sabbath a man could nearly wade across  the river. we do not travel on Sunday but pitch   our tents Saturday night or encamp in the waggons   & we do not move untill monday morning this is the  order of the camp      April 19, 1847 ~ Monday      19th It was quite cool in the morning. the bugle blew   at 5 for prayers & 7 for starting we travled two   abrest men walked by the side of their wagons, we   bore a notherly direction untill about noon when we reac  hed the north bend of the Platt.

Br Little brought many things that the Colonel   Kane sent as presents to the 12 & others I recieved a. stop box   Marriners compass small enough to carry in the pocket it   was a splendid present. May the blessings of God be   upon the head of Col Cane for his good feelings towards  the servants of God. during thi we camped at night   near a grove of timber on the bank of the Platt  we formed a circle from edge to edge of the bank   of the river the river on one side was our defence  we drove the tongues of our waggons out ward &   fore wheel of each waggon was placed against the   hind wheel of the waggon before it and all the  horses & cattle taken inside the circle so that we were  secure against the Indians. the river was about one  mile wide whare we camped & on the north side joinin-  g our encampment it was deep & rapid, the face of   the country during to days travel was on the south   side of the river high bluffs runing precpeitately to the   river on the north side which we travled a level prairie   without any bluffs about 2 miles from the river a rise   of table land about 10 feet & continues of a level  no timber except patches on the river soil sandy 22 mi     
 April 20, 1847 ~Tuesday      20th A hard wind through the night. this morning fair   but strong SW wind it covers our waggons with sand   & dust while journeying the soil is universally  sandy on the banks of the Platt the grass is now   about 4 inch high scattering not half feed. their are   many waterfowls about the Platt such as ducks geese  brant but the most numerous of all are the sand Hill Cranes which   flye in large flocks on evry side of us. 25 minutes past 7 we   started on our Journey, 2 1/2 miles came to another grove of small  & large cottonwoods covering about 40 acres, it was about   5 miles to the table land which was now rising into a bluff. Here  the road runs 20 degrees south of west bending to S by W, one mile   in which distance we passed 3 Islands in the Platt covered with   timber the largest about 10 acres & their continues a chain of   Islands for miles on the river & some timber on the south   side of the Platt. we came to shell creek 3 miles from our   encampment 1 1/2 miles to the right of shell creek is a prairie   dog village covering about 6 acres of ground. this Creek is timbered   ownly by a few scattering willows the river runs about   parallel with the river its general barings are abouc east &   west after crossing the shell creek bridge the road runs  about S.W by W 60 degres west of south for about 15 miles  the Platt is skirted with timber. Professer Pratt & myself   went forward of the company to take observation we traveled  about 13 miles & stoped bated horses took observations &c  while on the road we freequently see gopher hills from  one to 6 feet in circumference diamiter & from 3 inch to  2 feet in highth some resembling a potatoe patch which  makes it rough waggoning over them with the exception   of this it is the best road on the north side of the Platt   river I ever travled being a level dry hard road. our   standard Thermometer stood to day at 1 oclok  94°, / the  company approached us & we continued on 5 mile & the   whole encampment came up & we encamped for the night  in a circle, cut down cotton wood trees to feeds the   horses on the bark they will knaw off the bark from   brouse limbs & sticks 10 inches through as readily as they   would eat corn we have had to feed upon cotton wood   all the way thus far we give each horse also about 2 quarts   of corn per day. Our fisherman drew a net this afternoon  & broat into camp 213 fish Buffalo & Carp which was   divided in the Camp we had a Buffalo would weigh 10 lbs  a Carp 2 lbs & had a good supper. The Platt was a mile   wide whare we camped including an Island opposite of   us with timber the distance of the day 18 miles      April 21, 1847 ~ Wednesday      21st Cloudy with a light sprinkle of rain wind   in the east our road runs west to begin with  the ox teams started at 7 oclok the horse teams   at 8, 15 minutes to 9 an Indian appeared on a   mound mounted on a poney about 5 miles fro  us he went out of sight & again appeared   He then approached the camp full speed was   met by the brethren & shook hands was son   followed by others were 8 in all they went     
 through the encampment & then returned   with us the road runs 20 degrees south of   west 7 miles then turned 10 dgress North   of west at half past 12 we came in sight of   70 Indian Horses & Mules soon we came in   sight of a large Pawnee Indian village on the   north side of the lou fork & also a large one on   the south side of it. we drove on by the villages   & they soon began to sally out to come to us. we   camped in a half moon the bank of the river   forming a parallel line in front the indians to the   number of about 200 on the south side of   the river came down to the shore some waided   over about 75 came into camp including the   grand Chief of the Nation with many war chiefs  we met them before we left the ground & made   them presents of about 4 lbs of tobacco 15 lbs lead   powder fish hooks beads flour salt &c but still   they were not satisfied considering our num  bers they thought they ought to have had   more & when we left the ground they appeared vary   dissatisfied we however harnessed up our teams & drove on   to looking glass creek & camped at its mouth for the night   upon the bank of the loop fork after our horses were turned   out we were called together & in consequence of the dissat  isfaction of the Indians a guard of 100 men was called   for the quorum of the Twelve with nearly the whole   camp volunteered to stand guard one half the fore part   of the night & the other the latter part we had a picket   guard also of 5 men & mules at a time I with my mule   was on picket guard. we had hard wind & rain in the   afternoon which continued a part of the time while I   was on guard I rolled myself up in my buffalo & let the wind   & rain beat onto me we were releaved at about 1 oclok   & went to rest. But no Indians appeared during the   night      April 22, 1847 ~ Thursday      22 we crossed the looking glass 15 minutes to 9, & then   continued a westerly course there were a good many auter   on the looking glass. we arived at Beaver Creek at 12 oclok there   are some Beaver on this creek ^about one mile above its mouth^ Professor Pratt took the meridian   observation of the sun by the sextant for the Lat which was  found to be 41° 25' 15". Also found the magnetic needle   to vary about 12 degrees east. And found the barometer at half   past 12, 28. 711, the attached Thermometer standing   at 68° and the detached thermometer at 67° & also took an obser  vation of the sun for the ^true^ time in the morning it is 10 miles   between the two creeks which we travled this forenoon. we   crossed Beaver creek at half past 2 oclok, the road runs about   south west. the water was about to the deds [beds] of our wagg-  ons it was a rough steep bank to come out of about 12   men hitched a hook & roap to the tongue of each waggon   & puled them up; Beaver Creek is lined with scattering   timber cottonwood & willows, we travled 7 miles &   came to the Pawnee Mishionary station & camped for   the night the road was Bluff was skirted with some     
 Oaks on the North side of the road in the hills, we kept   out a gard through the night as we were in danger   of the Sioux on one side, and the Pawnees on the other  President Young addressed the Camp. & told them   when they left in the morning not to take away any   thing ownly what they brought with them unless it was   sold them by Brother Case who had had charge of the   Station for a long time & the goverment was owing   him a good deal & if he felt disposed to sell any thing   that he had in his possession & report to Goverment   he could do so. during the evening Professer Pratt   took made some observation at 15 m pas 7 oclok the   barometer stood at 28.7 inches attached Thermometer   64° detached Thermometer 60° North wind & fair  the same Also at 8 oclok 52 m found the double altitude   of the pole star to be 80° 20' 35" from which the   lattitude was deduced viz. O, Pratt. Also took the angular   distance of sun & moon for the Longitude at Beaver Creek ford also   the altitude of the moon for the tru time      April 23, 1847 ~ Friday      23rd At 6 oclok O Pratt made a barometrical observation  mercury standing at 28.697 inch attached Thermometer   36° detached thermometer 34° vary little wind from   west fair. Also took an altitude of the sun for the time, and   also A Meridan Altitude of the sun for the latitude found it   to be 41° 24' 29". While wattering the horses   at a creek at the station last evening Brother G. A. Smiths horse   mired & pitched foreward & Jumped onto him trod upon his   feet & breast & held him fast in the mud untill I caught   him by the bit & backed him off I was fearful he was badly   injured but at last found that he was but little hurt      [FIGURE] This was a day of adventures to the pioner camp in   the morning 12 of us started on horsback to search   out a ford across the dangerous difficult & troublesom loup   fork of the Patt river we went down the stream some   distance & several men waided across the stream & found   the water so deep & so much quick sand we concluded   to drive Hier up to the old Pawnee village so we returned   to the camp harnessed up our horses, my gray horse named   Titus had the belly ake or bots yet I started out with him   & the camp drove up with some little difficulty to the   old Indian village or a little below it & men commenced   searching out a ford & found the whole bed of the river   one universal dody [body] of quick sand which if a horse or   waggon stoped it would begin to sink down we   had two channels of water to cross with a sand bar in   in the middle the deepest water was from 3 to 4 feet deedp &   vary rapid & about 300 ^yards^ strait across some places of quick   sand was found so soft as to sink man or beast instantly in   & the more he strugled to get out the more he would sink  but we calculated to avoid such places as much as possible  As I was forward with my 10 or the first ten it fell to me to   make the trial professor Pratt having a strong pair of horses   went forward and I followed him I had two yoke of   cattle & my horses on my carriage with about 10 hundred     
 on I immediately saw as soon as I started that the cattle did  but little good were slow & in the way we would stop & bgin   to sink I Jumped out of my carriage into the water up  to my waist about 10 men came to my assistance with a   drag roap & hitched to the oxen & assisted me in getting   across the first stream but with great difficulty I   stoped on a sand bar out of water my horses & waggon im-  mediately began to sink & by treading the ground a little it   would become a perfect quagmire. but though we were   sinking in it the men had to leave the waggon whare it   was for O Pratt in trying to cross the second stream had   sunk into a bed of quick sand and all men had to go to his   relief to get his horses & waggon out the horses were taken   from the waggons the load taken out & carried to shore by  hand & the waggon drawn out by by the help of men  I took off a part of my load or most of it in a boat   & went through the second stream empty & got out two   other waggons done in the same way but it was so terri-  fic the rest of the camp would not follow suit. so their  were 6 men of us in all to spend the night to gether without   horses & waggons to guard against the whole Pawnee band that   were camped below us on the same side of the river should they   feel disposed to come upon us, there numbers were not known  but it was supposed they numbered over 600 warriors, we   divided our company which made ownly three of us on guard   at a time Br Pack O. Pratt & myself went on guard the  fore part of the night although I had been in the water   during the afternoon I stood guard in my wet clothing one   half the night & slept in them the other half, we had not more   than got our position for the night untill we were joined by   5 men who crossed the river in a boat were sent over by   President Young to assist us which made eleven men  instead of 6 so we divided our force accordingly. the   night past off in peace & no disturbance. distance from the  Missionary station to the ford 4 miles 4 miles      April 24, 1847 ~ Saturday      24th A plesant morning Professor Pratt took an observation   on the south bank of the fording place on the loup fork   4 miles from the Missionary station, took a meridian   observation of the sun for the Lattitude found to be   to cross the ^41° 22' 37".^ The camp now wer busiy in concocking plans  to cross the river the[y] drew together timber & rails to build   two rafts & began to put it together but some of the Breth-  ren made another trial to cross with waggons by putting   on several hors & mule teame they went a little hier up  than we did & got over with much less difficulty & the  more the ground was trod in the water the smother & harder   it grew, so the whole encampment turned there waggons  back to the ford & abandoned the raft & by unloading one   half of there baggage could cross in safety & the whole   encampment came over in that way by doubling teams   & going back & forth untill all were over each captain   with his ten assisted each other over, & so in this   way all Israel who were present went over (not Jordan)  but the Loup fork of the Platt river in safety without   damage to man or beast & we felt thankful in our hearts     
 to our God for his mercies unto us & that we were on   the south side of the river. we all loaded up our waggons  & drove 4 miles & camped for the Sabbath on the   bank of the stream After our waggons were placed   the Twelve & took a walk on the high table land to   make observations with our glasses of the sourrounding   country. Professor Pratt made a barometrical observation  at this place at 15 m past 7. Barometer stood at 28.56 inch   attached Thermometer 564° detached Thermometer 61°.5      April 25, 1847 ~ Sunday      25th Sunday a plesant morning. The order of the camp   is that there be no fishing, hunting or labour of any kind   on Sunday except such as is actually necessary. 4 antelope   appeared before us on the plain on the opposide side of   the river we could see them with the naked eye   but far more clearly through our spy glasses, there   sides & belly were white & backs brown these were the   first antelope I ever saw. about 10 oclok also 4 Elk appeared   on the opposite side of the river which we looked at with our  glasses these were the first Elk also I ever saw. the day was   mostly spent in resting man & beast untill 4 oclok, the camp   gathered together for a meeting & were addressed by a number of   the Brethren among whome was G. A. Smith & B. Young   who spoke upon principle upon breaking off the yoke from   the saints some pretended to say that the Twelve were   oppressing the People but is it so no, but if most men that   are on the earth those in the Church not excepted should   rule & lead this Church they would have many yokes   put upon them that we are all the while trying to take   off their shouldiers. many other good things were said  the guards were placed out as usual to guard the camp   during the evening a company of hunters were appointed to go   foreward of the camp to ketch game there were 7 hors-  eman & 10 footman the quorum of the Twelve also had the   privilege of Joining the hunters when they please. ^A^ Meriardian   Alt of the sun gave for the Lat 41° 20' 31".      April 26, 1847 ~ Monday      26th Early in the morning before the break of day 2 Indians   crept upon their hands & knees approaching the camp to   steal some horses they got within 3 rods of the guard before   they were discovered. they first thought them to be wolves   & snaped ^at^ them they rose up & run & two of the guard fired   at them & 4 others rose up out of the grass making 6 in   all the bugle was sounded and all arose up to arms not know-  ing but there was a large party nearby but we saw   no more. I started out in the morning with the hunters  we saw 8 deer 4 antelope but caught nothing we   travled 8 miles & camped for noon, on the opposite   side of the river we saw through our glasses the   relicks of an old Indian town. we saw 8 trails   leading to it with 6 & 8 abrest each in the afternoon   we travled we travled 7 miles & camped on clear   creek with a hard gravel bottom the first one   of the kind we had met with on the road. we   killed one wild goose & saw fresh buffalo signs     
 whare we camped this was the first signs of the kind   we had seen on the road. the travels to day was like   a level desert except except the dividing ridge betwen   the two rivers the grass was dry & sandy mostly level   & nearly without water we travled to day from 10 to 20 degrees   west of south we camped under a high bluff in a half moon Brs   Young, Kimball, Richard's, & myself went on to a high bluff to view   the country yust [just] at dusk a tremendious alarm was given thro-  ugh the camp that Indians had cralled up & taken Porter   Rockwell & his horse & made off with him many men mou-  nted there horses & made off with ^after^ him with all speed but   it was soon discovered that Rockwell was in the camp but   two horses were gone Dr Richards & Br Littles & about 20   men mounted & armed went in search of the horses but found   them not it was believed the Indians took off the horses 15 miles  distance of the day.

Rockwell & 3 others went again in search of the lost  horses & were gone all day we continued our Journey   a south course to try to get on the platt river, we   came on to some beautiful green grass & saw a great   quantity of buffaloo sign but found no wood or water  travled 12 miles & bated our horses in a green valley  Just as we were starting in the afternoon we rose   a small bluff & saw two antelope before us in the valley  Brs Young Kimball & myself were together Br Brown & another   Brother was on another side of the hill & saw him also Br   Brown first fired upon him another man & myself fired   also we all hit him with our balls but he did not fall  we rode up to him & cut his Throat to bleed him   & he run about 10 rods & fell this was the first antilope   we have killed he was dressed & put on board of the   waggons & we continued on in a short time we   saw 3 more at the top of a mound looking at us Br   Brown & myself went after them but they went onto   the flats & we could not get to them so we left them  turned about 10 degreeds east of South went to a Creek   & camped our cattle & horses were vary dry not finding   any water through the day, we had a heavy storm of   Thunder lightning wind & some little rain which lasted  about an hour. A rifle went off in Br Brown waggon   by accident the ball went through a bag of cloths   (set it on fire) through the waggon) & broke a leg of   a fine horse which broke up one team. in the edge of the   evening O. P. Rockwell & the Brethren with him returned   & reported that the Indians had stolen the two   horses & they were attacked by 15 Indians who were   in ambush in the grass they came upon them determined   to take their horses from them they kept them off   by their rifles & Pistles the Indians were armed   with guns & Bows & when they found they could not   skare the Brethren they then professed friendship to get   to them but the Brethren were resolute & determined   not to move but to fight first though ownly 4 to 15 men  the Indians finally rushed upon them to ketch the   horses by the bit & the Brethren drew their pistols upon     
 were prophets of God & that we had many prophets of God  I remember the time when we were to work hard to build the  Temple in Nauvoo I remembered what Broth Brigham said that if  we were faithful in finishing this Temple we should have  our Endowmts if we had to get them in a Tabernacle in   the wilderness we ar now in a tabernacle in the wilderness  & getting our blesings He said he would lead us to a place wher  we should have helth & dirnk the pure stream from the mountains  we now see it & I bear testimony that we have a prophet of God  with us even a Reveletor & it stregnghts my heart continualy  I enjoy all I have for if you do not listen to the voice & cou-  ncil of the presidency of this Church it will be more toler-  able in the day of Judgment for Sodam & Gomorrow than for  this people this has been one thing that has been an injury   to me when Brother Brigham went to England he asked   me to go with him when he got into the waggon to start  I told him I could not go he said I could go & he kept  beckening for me as long as I was in sight I then misd  it & it was an injury to me. I have Enlisted for a great   salvation we make our own Heaven or Hell & have Angels  or Devils enough to fill it. I dreamed the Deveil had a look  ing glass by looking into it you could see all the faults of  your Neighbours but could not see any of your own  I also Dreamed a woman went into Bishop Hunters &  stole Sister Hunters dress & came out into the street I  followed her to get the dress when I looked into her face  I saw she was a Black Negro wench I asked her  name she said it was Mesmerism wyo who hav the  priesthood should be careful to do the will of God      President Joseph Young requested the Seventies & the prests  to meet him in the Council Houts Meeting Adjoned till 2 oclk      Meeting Assembled at 2 ock was addresed By Father  Morley who bore testimoy of the work & spok of the  Indians      Brothe Sherwood next spoke bore testimony of  the work spoke of the Endowments in kirtland the desire Joseph   had to come to the wilderness but the Brethren would   not come untill the Devel drove them out, would do   any thing for salvation Advised the Elders when thy go  out to preach not to teach anything they do not know   & stop when they get through      Brother ^Wm^ Hyde next spoke & made many good remarks & said  18 year ago I was baptized by Br J. Murdook confirmed by  Orson Pratt. Brother Kimball said I will give you a key whareby  you may never fall alway keep within your bosom a Teachable  spirits. Brother Joseph said Be Humball & Teachable &   the Lord will bless you speak a good word occasionally for  Brothe Joseph I believe the next time we are opposed the door will  be opened wider & wider then ever & we shall be Freeer then Ever I  want to live in such a manner that at last we may meet   Brother Joseph with a glad Heart & cheerful countenance & a smile  upon the face.     
 Brother Kimball next spoke & said our design is to teach the  people & perfect them for what is to come I have herd many  say what sacrafices they had made for this cause but I have  left all for the cause I do not call it a sacrafie you are  to be rewarded with me. The Saints will have trials to  pass through the day will come when the women will have  to Feed the Beef & pork while the men go to war, take the  counsel of Brother Young & the Leaders of this Church you have  got to follow your leaders & they will lead you to the celestial  kingdom of God keep the things that have been committed to  you & the Lord will preserve you come to meeting to night male  & female at 6 oclk & we will tell you sumthing I never saw  this people when they were doing better or felt better than they  do to day I know that Brother Brigham is tender & kind to this  people their is no woman more kind to a child than he is   to this people He is a Father to us continually I am going   to put in evry Ox I have got into the public works &   I want evry man to do the same untill the debts are paid  we must trust in God & cleave unto him as Jesus does unto the Fater      Meeting adjourned till evening when the House was filled agan &  was addressed By Bishop Hunter who told his experience since  he came into the Church & was followed By President Young      [FIGURE] President Young ar[o]se & said I will bear Testimony   to awhat Brother Hunter said that the Elders go work & pull  in ther wards & get the people to gathe at my house if nowher  els & preach if it is but few moments I would pray & labor   till I could Preach you say that you would go & preach to the  Stranger & teach them the gospel I know it is esier to t[e]ach   them than it is to get the Saints togethe & teach them to  be saved & exalted I now it is the desire of this people   to get sumthing new but you should improve upon what you have  Here is the place to expose your ignorance & fals views, to let  them out & be corrected if you have faults dont go into  private Houses & preach them whare thare is no one to correct  you nor while abroad among others countrys but here is the  place to let your Errors out not keep them back. Teach  people to controll themselves teach good doctrin & practice it  Here is the place to become a polished shaft I like to reman  here to see you to be with you. I want to say to the Elders of  Israel ofwere you ordained to preach the gospel if so it is not  wisdom or prudent to mingle with the excesses of the   wicked or in any of their exercises for then the devil will  have no advantage over you I mingle with the Saints here  in thei recreations & exercises but let me go abroad & subject  myself to mingle with the wicked I am on the Devils ground  & subject myself to him. If I mingle with any company here  for recreation I controll that company but if I step onto  the Devils ground He controlls it. remember then at all times  that what you do do it in the name of the Lord & let all your  acts be to do the will of God it is so that a man could not  exercise his privileges because of the tradition of the world all  Christians would think it a great sin to have a Fiddle     
 they would say it is wicked to have music they have made it   a sin I have not put a desire in my heart for music, but   the Lord has. Music will calm the ferocious beasts who   caused this the Lord. I want to say a few words about   tithing you now what was said at the last confernc the   Saints have done more during the last 7 months than   in 7 years before I feel to bless you call upon this people   to put their all upon the Alter & they will do it I feel like a  Father to this people. No mother can love Her babe more than  I do this people. when you do wrong I feel oppressed in spi[ri]t   & the Lord is grieved I feel to urge it upon you all to sceace   to do evel & learn to do righ all that we have is the Lords He   does as He pleases the Thrones & kingdoms of the world are   all governed by him & in the End all will be found right   & they will find they have an agency unto themselves &   all will do as they please if they do right they will be   saved get Glory & Exaltation & the wicked will go to Hell  there is no place whare God is not find Empty space & there the   Lord will not be.      [FIGURE] I will now preach you another Sermon   their is one great Master inand Head in all kingdoms & governments   So with our Father in Heaven is a Tabernacle He created us   in the likeness of his own image. The Son has also a Taberna  cle like the Father & the Holy Ghost is a minister to the people but   not a tabernacle who begat the Son of God Infidels say that   Jesus was a Bastard but let me tell you the truth concerning   that matter. Our Father begat all the spirits that were bef[or]e   any tabernacles we[r]e made when our Father came into the   Garden He came width his celestial body & brought one of his   wifes with him & eat of the fruit of the garden untill   He could beget a tabernacle and Adam is Michael or God   and all the God that we have any thing to do with they Eat   of this fruit & formed the first Tabernacle that was   formed and when the VIRGIN MARY was begotton   with child it was by the Father and in no other way in  no other way ownly as we were begotton I will tell you   the Truth as it is in God. The world dont know that Jesus   Christ Our Elder Brother was begotton by our Father in Heaven   Handle it as you please it will either seal the damnation or   salvation of man He was begotton by the Father & not   by the Holy Ghost. When you go to Preach & believe that   Jesus Christ was begotton by the Holy Ghost dont lay Hands   upon the Heads of Females for the reception of the Holy   Ghost lest it Beget her with Child and you be accused   I have told you nothing in this thing but what you have   red in the Bible I do not frame it.      The President then refered to the tithing & said if one quartor of   the Tithing money that was due had been paid we should   have had more means the merchanets have carried away   $200,000 to the States did the people pay tithing on that No  now Bishops se[e] to this matter & then see what your   feelings would be if you was in my place & see the   Hundreds that call upon me & my Brethren if the Tithing   was paid that is due we would have enough to pay all   debts I now say to the Bishops go to my yard & take all my stok   & lick all up clean then do the same by my Brethren untill   all the debt are paid All voted to follow the presidents example     
 April 10, 1852 ~ Saturday      [FIGURE] Saturday morning meeting opened at 10 oclok House filled   [FIGURE] Prayer by W. Woodruff President Kimball called for   Professor A Carrington but made the following remark  you have learned Enough to know know that the spirit of   God will be grieved at any folly manifest in the House   of God Angels are ministering spirits to those who are heirs   of salvation but when you do wrong the Angels of the   Lord will leave and the Angels of the devil will take there   place & keep their company then you are on dangerous   ground & if you will not hear the prophets that God sends   unto you you would not hear the Angels of God some   have said that I was vary presumptuous to say this   Brothor Brigham was my God & Savoiour Brothe Joseph   was his God the one that gave Joseph the keys of the   kingdom was his God which was Peter Jesus Christ   was his God & the God & Fathe of Jesus Christ was   Adam. The Lord wants us to have wisdom to circumscribe   the Earth do you not suppose that God has pleasure in   seeing this people who are the weak things of the Earth to confound   the wise Noble & great some will tell the gentiles all that   transpires among us      Brothe Joseph Young followed with   a few remarks      [FIGURES] A Carrington was then called to the Stand who   arose & said I rejoice with you my Brethren in the   blessings you enjoy yes I rejoice with you. Brother Kim-  ball sayes that what I say will be right. All science   that is in the world that is not consistant with reason &   demonstration is false. But all that is truth is good no matter   who has it. with regard to Education we are all interested   in it yet we have different views of it. Their is three   things that are hard to speak upon 1st is a dinner   speech 2nd is a Temperance speech 3rd is a speech  on Education I despise that vain phylosophy that   puffeth up. I do not know of any truth that does   not belong to salvation that is of worth evry thing that   is knowledge pertains to salvation we have come unto   the work and have to save ourselves our Children & our   progenitors I dont know of any thing that we can do   to lay a foundation for this better than to disipline   the mind & Body & bring them both in subjection to   the mind & will of God the ownly way we can do right  is to keep the commandments of God. One of the command[ment]s   of God require us to multiply & replenish the Earth when a   young man gets married to a good young woman & the   Hunny moon is over and a foundation laid for posterity   then the man begins to scold his wife the wife gets the   same spirit & this goes to the child this is an Evil & foll[ows]   the child through life. The Blood nurses the embrio &   as the child grows the Evil increases with the child  the Hunny moon should last always & the Husband should   gratify the wife in all things that she righteously wishes as  far as he can & the mother should possess a spirit of contentm[ent]   & peace at least untill the child leaves the Breast then you     
 will see a Noble Tabernacle for a Noble spirit to dwell   in the spirits in Eternity have their times & seasons   would not a Noble spirit rather take a Noble Tabernacle   than a poor one when many children are born they   cannot suck the breast because of the corruption of   their parents this is probably the fault of the Doctors   for not teaching the female as they ought to be taught   & when the child is born the practice has been to give   it a Brandy tody or Chamber lie while the breast is the   place for the child let the child have the milk & let let   such foolery alone dont play with the tabernacles of your   children or treat them foolishly but treat them in   wisdom you dont see any body giving a Brandy Tody or   chamber lye & they do well to follow the course of nature  The gentile Doctors cannot cure deseases they do not know  how I will prove it to you the old school give medicine by the   shovel full. The New school will not give a pill as large   as the smallest Bird shot. is their any Equality in this I say   down with the whole system I have no use for them next   comes the Hdrapath the water cures well even water is   not to be trifled with look at the foolery & the difference   of the doctors it is much better to follow out the natural law   in all things than to trust to them who would ever think of   giving such a dose to a calf as they would give a child  Their is no such children as the Latter day Saints   If we cannot do what we want to our children may   if we cannot get back to the primeval platform  becaus of the primeval platfor iniquity of our Fathers   still it is our duty to teach them principle & truth when   children begin to talk dont teach them baby talk for   what you learn the child in that state has to be unl-  earned then be careful what you say or do before   your children for you would be asstonished at the atte-  ntion children pay to what you say. Be sure to take time   to teach your children & not neglect it many other   interesting remarks were made by Brother Carrington on   the occasion      Brother G A. Smith followed with interesting   remarks      President B Young next followed & said I want to bear   testimony to what Brother Carrington has said he   has spoken the truth I thank him for what he has   said what he has said is true and if we follow the testi  mony we will return to the power of our first parents   his is the way for the Nations of the Earth to return   to God. The Lamanites will be a white & delightsom   people through this procedure or principle the Nation   of the Earth cannot return to God upon any other   principle this kind of teaching is what pleases me the   Doctors are ignorant & they teach others to be ignorants  we should understand our organization but the people   of this day have lost all good scense they are a set of     
 fools because they have been taught to be fools now   have some sens & believe what Brother Carrington   has said I now these things are virtueous principles the   world are corrupt you have got to be pure in heart   or you cannot abide the day that is coming      at 2 oclok P. M D H Wells addressed the Saints &   bore testimony to the work of God      Brother Wm I Appleby made some remarks conce[rnin]g  parents & children      Brother G. D. Walt next spoke. He said he was the   first Baptized in England      Wm Clayton next spoke & expressed his feelings      Brother Kimball next spoke for a short time &   meeting was adjourned till Sunday morning        April 11, 1852 ~ Sunday      Sunday Morning April 11th After singing & prayer Broth  Kimball addressed the meeting & said the spirit of God   would make a humbly man handsome I do not place  my affections upon any thing but God & Jesus Christ   you ought to love Brother Brigham enough to keep his   commandments so with my family if they love   me they will keep my commandments if you want to   be a friend to Brother Brigham & his counsellors live  Holy before God & do right & if you will do what you know  you will do right do by your neighbor as you would wish   him to do unto you Some men wanted to get women   from their husbands who are dead & get them   sealed to them such would rob the dead this is   wrong let me do for the dead what they cannot  do for themselves & this is right & the dead will plead   for that man to be blessed. Never take a course a  course to rob the dead I will have time to redeem   all my dead friends either in time or Eternity  the Malinium will be spent in the Temples of the Lord   in Redeeming our dead if my friends will not Receive  my testimony I will let them alone & when they  have been in Hell long enough I will go & Redeem   them I will take a course to get tothe Bless Blessing upon   my seed that Adam had upon his seed Joseph had it   & I have it if my children sin they will have i to   Repent of & pay for it but will be saved in the End.   we should not go to law with each other all that   will not go to Law say I all said I, I would as  lieves be damned without a man as to be damned   with a man that would steal a dead mans wife for   he will be damned any how. I will say that Broth[er]  Hunter is the chief Bishop & he has a right to  chose his two counsellors Bishop Hunter arose   & made some remarks & said he should choose men     
 that could assist He said Brother Brigham Young  was at the Head & his councellors were inspired of   the Holy Ghost I select for my councellors Brigham  Young & Heber C Kimball. Then Brother Kimball   & W Richards laid Hands upon Bishop Hunters  Head & blessed him in the following words    O God the Eternal Father I ask in the name of Jesus   Christ while we lay our hands upon thy head   that all our words may be dictaited b[y] the Holy spirit   while we set apart Brother Hunter as a presiding Bishop  we here by set you apart to be a presiding Bishop   & to be a Judge in Israel we bless you with the  spirit of your Office & calling you shall have wisdom  to Judge between good & Evil in all things & to be   a great Benefit to the House of Israel & that they   may uphold thee by their faith that thou mayest   administer in in faith & righteousness & be a great   blessing to the people & administer to the poor & nedy  thou shalt have desernment like the lightning to detect it  evil & those who seek to deceive & that all may receive   thy teachings & that thy work may work together for the   good of all the people even so Amen    Brother Truman Angel was Nominated to continue   in his office of Architect for the Church was carried    [FIGURE] Brother Kimball said to Brother Brigham   you shall be blessed & all your House & not one of them   shall be lost & no man shall get betwen me   & Brother Brigham & Brothe Richards & no   man or woman shall get between the Twelve   & Presidency if they do they will get pinched   & any man or woman that tries to get between   us will be damned they tried to prejudice Joseph  against us in his day & they will be damned  The Twelve are the best men that live and any   man that tries to put their feet upon their neck   will get the feet of the Twelve upon their neck  (Brother Brigham came in at this time) do as Br   Brigham tells you & all will be right & you will   not have sorrow follow my council & you will   not have sorrow. If my own family would take   my council & had faith in me I would never have   a doctor in my family but I have doctors here   that I have faith in but let me send for a doctor   & they have faith in him & not in me then what   for them am I. Brother Brigham said that is   true & worthy of note it is natural for a man to  be always borrowing trouble but we have trouble enough  without borrowing. If you are not one you are not   mine saith the Lord but if you abide in me you will  bring forth fruit to the glory of God when we   learn this lesson our sorrows will scease when we   get the cloak off we shall be in heaven In this     
 House is my Heaven for I am in a heavenly place   with Holy men & Angels The Bishop with Brothe Hunter  are good men. Seth Taft was appointed a travelling  Bishop others were spoken off as travelling Bishops  I have been talking about the union in the world their   would be a patition between the different Branches   but in the kingdom of God it is not so but they are  all united. If I hier a man to work I want him  to be faithful in all things evry man should earn all  they can & labour all they are able to do & not over labour  I believe a man should be paid according to what they   earn as God rewards men according to their works  The old Lions neck is out of the yoke & they will not   put it on again for Brother Brigham shall whip   them out & they shall not whip him out nor me nor  my Brethren. you shall be blessed & the Earth shall  bring forth for your good & your shlall be blessed in   your posterity And I say it in the name of Jesus Christ  Brother Brigham said it was a prophesy & was true      Conference was Adjurned untill the special confenc  in August      April 12, 1852 ~ Monday to April 23, 1852 ~ Friday      From this conference till Friday Apriail 23rd I   spent the time at home doing my spring work & prepar  ing to go on our Journey to the South On this day April 23rd  I left the City of the great Salt Lake & rode to dry creek in   Utah through a snow storm & spent the night in company   with Brother Nobles on the Bank of the creek 30 miles  The object of this Journey was to accompany the presidency   to visit the Southern settlements & explore as far as we had   an opportunity      April 24, 1852 ~ Saturday      24th we rode Held a meeting rode to Hobble Creek went  forth in the dance with the saints in that place distance of the day 25 mls      April 25, 1852 ~ Sunday      25 Sunday we held a meeting at the school House the   people were addressed by O pratt was followed by B Young   H.

 September 12, 1852 ~ Sunday      [FIGURE] Sept 12th Sunday 12th O Pratt Preached the Funeral serm[on]  of Lorenzo D. Barnes & Wm Burton who had died in  England & were buried there but their bodies were taken  up & brought to the vally of the great Salt Lake & buried with   dead Saints in this place. The follow is a synopsis of the discours  [FIGURES] L.D.B W.B.      Elder Orson Pratt arose & said the subject   before us this morning is one that fills my mind with  many reflections I think the Elders of this Church & kingdom   do not improve their time as they should but are to slow in  treasure up knowledge as God has commanded us to do  we shall want all the knowledge we can obtain when  we go to the nations of the Earth & visit evry circle of the   learned to teach them the plan of salvation if we have improved  our time we can bring forth out of the treasures of our   hearts things new and old. The subject before me   to day is the remains of Lorenzo D. Barnes & Wm Barton  the question might arise what benefit could it be to those   Brethren to be brought from their Graves in a foreign   country & be buried with the saints here. I do not think  it would be a great advantage to them in the Eternal world  I had as lieves to be buried in Asia or Africa as with the   the Saints here as far as my Eternal interest is conserned  but aside from this it is a great pleasure both to the living &   the dead to know that our bodies will be brought to Zion   from the Ends of the Earth to be laid with the saints   & then to be raised with them so that he can strike   hands with his relatives first & then with the saints  instead of being thousands of miles apart & having to  waft himself thousands of miles through the air to meet  with his brethren. An Immortal being can take   himself up into the heavens as Jesus Christ did when  he was raised from the dead He went to heaven So it  might be with them. How long would it take for Brother  Barnes & Burton to waft themselves to the bosom of the Church  Not long whare will be the bosom of the Church in the  clouds above the Earth before the wicked are diestroyed  the Lord will be in the Air & all the saints with him of all  generations and He will desend to earth & will bring all the   Saints with him. At what speed would the Saints travel   we are told that light is the power that governs all things  if the saints travel as fast as light they would go at the   rate of 200000 miles in a second. God can go as fast as light  and He has made the saints and I am led to conclude that   they can travel as fast as light for they have got to go on   missions to far distant worlds and if they did not go   as fast as light they would be a long time on their way spending   their time without doing any good if this is the case I had   as lieves lay my body down abroad as at home as it would  not take more than a second to meet with the Saints I say   this to encourage the Elders who are going abroad some may   die abroad some may Seal their testimony with their   Blood. The Elders should take Heed & not break the comma-  ndments of God if they were to commit adultery after     
 receiving their Endowments they cannot be forgiven but   must be destroyed in the flesh & his spirit given to the   buffiting of Satan untill the first Resurrection  How long it will be from the morning till evening I   am not able to say but after the day of redemption   He will come forth and inherit all the blessings that   were sealed upon his head no power can take them   from him If he has been sealed to any woman  thrones powers Dominions or Kingdoms or any   other blessing He will inherit them to all Eternity   if they do not shed innocent Blood. The scriptures  speak of these same subjects. Paul while speaking   to the Corinthian Churches speaks of delivering a certain   one to the buffiting of Satan that they may be destroyed   in the flesh that their spirits may be saved in the day  of the Lord Jesus Christ. we will now speak of David   who had a numerous family that was given him  He finally took Uriah wife put Uriah at the Head   of the Battle & He was slain. Here He lost all right to the   celestial Glory His wives Thrones Kingdoms & Eternal    lives All had vanished He Just escapes Hell & that is all  He will be a servant to somebody perhaps Uriah for   the Gods in Eternity will want servants to greece their   carriages makes crowns & Robes &c they will be Gods   & want servants. All may be capaciated to become   Gods but all will not keep the Laws whareby they   may become Gods. Peter spoke of a people who had   shed inocent Bloo & drew the Blood of the Savior they   were told to repent that they might be saved in the   day of the Lord Jesus Christ. There was a chance for  them as they did not know the Priesthood or the fulness   of the gospel if they had know it they would not have   been forgiven. We will now speak of Brother Lorenzo  D. Barnes He was faithful but died before he received  the fulness of the gospel He had no Thrones, wives  or any thing els of that kind sealed upon [him] what shall we   do for him any thing that we do for ourselves  when we get a temple built such men will  loose nothing for they will be Judged by the same laws   that we are and they have a chane either in time  or Eternity to receive all we have. for all that   would have received it here will receive it there for all   men will be Judged like men in the flesh for all mankind   will have an Equal privilege there cannot be any baptism  Endowments or Ordinances in the spirit world performed   but we shall be called to perform in a Temple of the   Lord all the ordinances for the dead the same as for the   living all things will be sealed to the End of all things  preparitory to the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ whether   they be appertaining to Thrones, kingdoms, families or anything   Els pertaining to Earth or Heaven time or Eternity. when   we fully consider our duty we shall not be at Ease in   Zion or spend our time to make farms & Houses orchards &   vineyards for ourselves alone. But we should go to work to build   up Zion & a Temple & do the great work of our God wo to them  that are at ease in Zion but wake up & do the work of our God

But when we come to  the Latter Day Saints we find them the ownly people on Earth   that suit the case exactly in evry respect and they are the   the kingdom of God & hold the keys of that kingdom & they   fell disposed to honor & respect their Father Abraham & their   children & desire to render unto Israel all that belongs unto them  He was followed by O Hyde & W.

The Meeting opened by   prayer by President Orson Hyde who is president of the   Twelve Apostles. The names of the Twelve who were present   were O Hyde P. P. Pratt W. Woodruff J. Taylor G. A Smith A Lyman   C. C. Rich E. T Benson L Snow E. Snow & F D Richards      President Orson Hyde made some appropriate remarks upon   the rare & eventful occasion upon which we are now met   He offered up a fervent prayer & Thanksgiving to God for   his blessings that had been over us in our separation & in bring-  ing us together & asked for all needful blessings to qualify us   for our futur labours untill we arive in the celestial kingdom   of God He then said he did not feel like making a long speech   but merely interchanging our harty congratulations in ackno-  wledgeing the mercy & blessings of God      P. P. Pratt expressed his feelings and after happily refering   to our vast separetion & merciful reunion said this is the first   opportunity we have had of being together as a quorum   & feeling that each member has the most implicit   confidence in evry member of the quorum of the Twelve   & also in each member of the Presidency who presides over   us. I feel as though the day is not far distant when men   will stand among us in their Immortal Bodies holding the keys   of death & Hell & that Brother Joseph would say if he was a[mo]ng   us that we had suffered enough & that we should be numbered   among his Jewels He alluded to the great work we had to per-  form, the building of a Temple &c      W. Woodruff next spoke & expressed his feelings upon the subj-  ect of this meeting of the Twelve Apostles a blessing which he   never before enjoyed in his life. As he never had met     
 with Eleven of the Twelve Apostles. He considered there had   never been but two bodies of men since the days of Adam   who had met under such peculier & interesting circumstances   & those were the Twelve Apostle with Jesus in Jerrusalem & the   Twelve Apostle with Jesus in Ameri[c]a we know their History & works   & we know our own & they are three events of great importance   to the salvation of the world. He refered to the peculiar & strik-  ing fact that there had never been a death in the quorum of the   Twelve Apostles except in the case of David. W. Patten who fel  a martyr to his religion by a special request which he made of   the Lord that he might die that death. But the rest of the quorum  of the Twelve have stood in the front of the battle & the danger   for the last twenty years in the midst of mobs sickness & plagues   & dangers by sea & land but still they were preserved untill the   present day in bloom & health He refered to the great prosperity &   work of the Twelve abroad among the nations & rejoiced that the   Lord had preserved them to returned from the fore cornors of the   Earth to again sit in counsel together in Zion. He had the most im-  plicit confidence in each member of the quorum of the Twelve Apostles   also of the Presidency who presided over us said President Young was a Father   to the whole church      Erastus Snow next spoke & said though he was one of the youngest of the   quorum of the Twelve yet he had known the quorum from the begining   when they were first together in his fathers house He expressed his   Joy in being with the quorum & his Entire confidence in each member   of the quorum & in the Saints generally. Since his absence to Denmark   he had felt & learned how to appreciate the society at home & the brethren   & anticipated much pleasure in the association of this present winter  hoped our meetings might be freequent & that we might become   much improved.      President O Hyde remarked that if we were at liberty to prophesy   it is while we are together as we are moved upon by the Holy Ghost   and if we dont fell to prophesy speak by faith & by faith it   should be fulfilled expressed his unlimited confidence in evry member   of the Quorum & of the Presidency and Prophesied in the name   of God that we should all meet & come forth in the morning   of the first Resurrection & receive our crowns in the celestial   kingdom it was confirmed by a good Amen by all the quorum      John Taylor next spoke said he glad to meet with the quorum  He refered to the changes taking place among the Nation of the Earth & he   believed we were destined to soon hold a great influence among them   He had felt moved upon at times to offer at times some counsl   to sir Robert Peel & Louis Napolian & such men & tell them that   he could give them advice that would do them good He believed the   day near when the kings near would seek counsel at our hands   in the begining the Elders went out & were weak & ignorant men now   they are full of intelligence & the Nations of the Earth will feel their   influence when I am with this quorum I feel as though I was   with the Gods.      G A Smith said he was delighted on the present occasion He   rejoiced to see the union of the quorum & their disposition to do right   we dont have to feel that one of the quorum like Lyman Wight is   drawing off one way & John E. Page another & A Wm Smith commit-  ing iniquity & we have to sustain him against our feelings. I have     
 the satisfaction of believeing that each member of the quo[ru]m   is doing right & I rejoice that the quorum is able to publish the   gospel in six different Languages & to gather the people   together Hoped we should meet once a week & with the Presid[enc]y   offer our prayers. He felt a proud satisfaction of being associ-  ated with 10 men which he believed to be the highest learned   best Educated & possessed the most intelligence of any man on   Earth That our circumstances were such that we were oblieged   to have the most knowledge whether we would or not. He believed   the prophesies uttered this evening would be fulfilled to the utter most   He closed with his blessings upon us.      A Lyman said he had so many things upon his mind that he knew   not what point to speak from He felt in his nature that he was   made up in the work of the Lord & he could not embrace any interest   any whare els ownly in this work. He has found out to his satisfa-  ction what that love & affection for his brethren is that surpases the   love of women for he had a confidence in his quorum that was   far greater than in his wives or children for they have been   brought up in the hard school of experience & have been tried in   all things & proven to be true & I have been proven with them   & I am wedded to my quorum with all my interest I go when   I am sent & come when I am called, & so expect to continue to do   my interest is inseparably conneted with this kingdom & I trust   ever will be through time & Eternity.      C. C. Rich said those who had spoken ^met^ his feeling. He concured   in them all I am happy in the present meeting. I had a dream while   on my way home I thought the Ancients in their resurrected bodies   were associating with us in this place. I have the most unbounded confi-  dence not ownly in the quorum of the Twelve but also in the first   Presidency. I hope the winter seasons may be profitable to us in our   associations and that we may improve our time      E T Benson said he felt to concur in what had been said I feel it   to be a great blessing to come together we have been blessed according to   the desire of our hearts before I Joined the Saints I felt as though I   would give all I possessed if I could find a people who wold do   right & be led by the spirit & power of God & I could be associated   with them I now feel that I have found that people. I now feel associ-  ated with men with whom I could trust my Eternal interes   I could leave my family with them any length of time & find   them all right on my return. I have the utmost confid[en]ce   in evry member of that quorum. there is nothing to be done   but what we can do. Evry gift & qualifycation exhists in   this quorum that there is in the church Els we cannot be   equal with the first Presidency & they must have all we have   got or they could not preside over us. If the first Presidency   were to be removed the quorum of the Twelve would have to preside  & if they had not the fulness of the gifts they wold not be   fit to preside. I feel excedingly thankful to be associated   with such men I have not language to express my feelings when   I was first called to be an Apostle in this quorum I could not   sleep for three days & nights I feel now as though I could   break a Nation to pieces I felt renovated with the Holy   Spirit while P P Pratt was speaking No blessing is to great or to   good for us & we shall possess them all.

 A Speech of P. P. Pratt in the Council Chamber of the Legislative Assembly      Council Chamber Wednesday Dec 18th 1852 10 oclok A.M.  Councilor P. P. Pratt occupied the Chair in the abscence of the president  but resigned it to address the council. The Honorable Counselor said  Gentlemen. I resign my place to the Hon CounsellrCouncilor on my left  & beg the privilege to express my views on government at some length  No merely human Government ever had the power to originate  or esstablish a system of true religion but on the other hand a true  religious system contains within itself the inherant and inaliena-  ble germs of all true Government. True religion has the right  & the power to originate government & Laws for individuals  Families, Corporate Bodies, States, Nations, Empires, or worlds,  A true systems of Religions Embraces all the real government   that intelligent beings can need or reasonably desire in the   Heavens or on the Earth Mearly human government never  created a Prophet an Apostle an Eternal High Priest a God  or a Son of God. On the other hand the Eternal Priesthood has  created worlds & peopled them with man & with all the variety  of universal vegitable & animal resources. The Eternal priesthod   has Eternal Priesthood Elected ordained & anointed Kings  & priests upon Our Earth & filled them with the spirit of   wisdom knowledge power might majesty & dominion for the  benefit, instruction, government, & exhaltation of the race or  of the nations or nations thus favored. All governments not  growing out of the true system & authority of religion is a  perversion a mockery a dark unwieldy mass without   certainty, stability or guarantee for evin peace safety   or perpetoity all such government is either founded in  ignorance or self will wharein the people declair either in word  or in act that God and Inspiration shall not controll them   & that an Angel Prophet Apostle Priest or King Commishined  by him shall have no rule or have no sway in their National  Councils. All such governments are either in open violatin   Rebellion against the powers that be or act wholey ignorant  of the powers that have a right to be. I will illustrate this subj.  by refferane to the past. When man was first placed upon   the Earth did he create governments or was governments   given ^appointed^ to him by the Election of God made manifest by Revelation  did the lower Creation rise up & Elect Adam or dig God say  Have thou dominion from whence then was the first introduct-  ion of merely human government upon our Earth. The  answer to this you will find in the words of God which He spake  unto Moses on the mount as revealed in those days by our great  Prophet & myrter. informing us that Adam begat Sons &   daughters who went out & peopled the land in pairs long before  the birth of Cain & Ableel. And when Adam taught them the word  of the Lord & the principles of righteousness & true government  Satan came also among them & said unto them believe it not  and they believed not in the teaching of Adam but they believed  Satan more than God or more than the ruler He had appointed  Thare then arose the foundation of self Government withot God  A government which was perpetual for many centuries  and which finally filled the Earth with violence & corruption  & was overthrown by the flood of those who survived the flood Noah  was of course     
 the lawful king Patriarch or ruler and after him the Election  of God continued through the loins of Shem down to Abraham  but in Abrahams day according to his own writings lately  taken from the tombs of ancient Thebees & translated and  published by our great Prophet we find a man made goverment  existing in Egypt under a race of Phariohs. This Egypt according  to Phario Abrahams account was first discovered by Egyptus or  Daughter of Ham who afterwards settled her sons in it & from whol  whom sprang the race of Pharaioh's & the Ancient Egyptians the same  authority also informs us that Ham & his race were cursed as it  regards priesthood but blessed in matters pertaining to the   fruits of the Earth & of wisdom. And that the Pharioh's & their  priests had not the priesthood although they pretended to have  received it from Ham their progenitor. Hence we find a   Government in Egypt of mere human origen and a pri-  esthood and Religion by law Esstablished which worshiped  several Gods among which was the crockadile & which sacrafized  Human sacrafices upon the Alter of State Hence the calling out of  Abraham & the reesstablishing of a government of God to be per-  petuated in his linage for Ever. which linage is Elected to reign  & rule & hold the keys of religion Priesthood Power & Government  while the Earth endures & in worlds without End. This govern-  ment was perpetuated in the family of Isaac & Jacob & was exem  plified in the person of Joseph who by the gift of Revelation became   prime minister of Egypt & saved his Fathers house & the Nations   from Death by famine. Here is an instance of a mere Human   government yielding to be instructed & benefited by a Revelation   & a prophet Behold the result Descending the stream of time & traceing   the fortunes of the chosen or Royal linage we next find a Moses   a man in whom was the spirit of true Religion. By this religion   He overthrew the Egyptians delivered the nation from bondage led   them forth to freedom & gave them laws. By this Religion his   successor Joshua was also Elected & qualified through him   by the laying on of hands and by this religion were all the Judges   chosen & qualifyed to fill the Judiciary with equity & Justi[c]e  Now Mr President it is Clear that none of these glorious   events were the result of popular Elections or of human   institutions.      God gave a system of Religion Embracing   Inspiration visions Prophets & Priesthood & that Religion   & those prophets & Revelations Created Nations Governments   & Laws. Hence true government in all its Branches and   Ramification is the legitimate result or production   of true Religion. For instant the Prophet Samuel by virtue   of his Religious gift had power to Elect by the word of God   & to Anoint Saul to be king of Israel and by the same   religious authority he had the right to reprove & even to   reject that same king & to anoint & place upon the head   Throne a shepherd boy called david in his stead And   when Samuel was dead & David was king of Israel Nathan   another Prophet had power to reprove him for iniquity &   to pass Judgment upon him for his sins. Again when Elijah   had rebuked King Ahah & all his wicked rulers & adulterous priests   & had fled to the mountains because they rebelled & saught his   life He was commanded to return and Anoint Jehu for King   of Israel. Haziel for King o[f] Syria & Elisha for Prophet in   his Stead which he performed & was taken up.     
 In all these things I see not a vestage of the trumpary   of modern human institutions Either of democracy whigery   monarchy or Arisstocricy I see nothing in fact but religion   standing forth in its own native simplicity & clad in the   panoply of its own legiteimate heavenly powers giving government   & Laws to Nations and appointing and Anointing majestrates   kings & Judges to administer the same. But leaving for a moment   the events of palestine I glance for a moment at Babylon   whare sat Nebuchadnezzar in all the pride of self confidence   & self government. This Monarch had denyied the hand of God   & imputed to himself the power & glory of Babylon and the   magnitude & glory of his vast dominion He had also   Esstablished a Religion & created it by law at a given signal   all person ^on pain of death^ were to bow down to his images & idols. But Daniel & his   fellows were their with the true Religion   Dreams, interpetations, visions, prophesyings, and Miracles   & the word of God Rebuking & punishing him soon converted   him to the truth He then published an Epistle to all Nations   & Tongues under his dominions & in all languages the perpose   of which was that God was a revealer of secrets a worker   of signs & wonders & an originator & controler of political   power & government. [##Daniel 1-4##] In Babylon it was soon conseded   that the wisdom of one Revelator or Prophet was ten   times more valuable than all the combined wisdom of its   sages without this gift. Hence Daniel was wisely placed   in power as president of the Presidents of more than a   hundred provinces. [##Daniel 6:1-3##] This same Daniel by the word of the   Lord afterwords reproved & Dethroned Belshazer and placed   Cyrus the Mede upon the Throne of Babylon. [##Daniel 5:29-31##] This Monarch   obeyed the word of the Lord so far as to restore the Jews &   rebuild their City & Temple. [##Ezra 1##] So long as the Jews obeyed   the voice of their Prophets they prospered & were free   but loosing the spirit of prophesy & true religion they   forfeited their institutions laws & doctrin. Hence John  the Baptist & Jesus Christ found them in bondage to a   Government Called Rome.      These Romans like the   Greeks before them had manufactured their own Govern  ment & Religion & then enforced it upon others insom-  uch that the Jews themselves having lost the power of   their own religion were oblieged to submit. John the   Baptist & Jesus Christ reproved all the needless trash   & powerless forms of Jewish sects & of Gentiles supers-  titions & restored to the world the gifts of prophesy visions   Revelation ^&^ Miracles. which would have broaken the human   yoke reesstablished the independance of Israel & made   Jerrusalem the perpetual seat of Government for all   nations. But they would not. Jesus Christ would have   made their Temple a house of prayer for all Nations in all   coming time He would have placed there the Eternal keys   of priesthood power & Government & wisdom. ^* A page missed   turn to the star^      The Blackness of Darkness veiled the Earth in morning   Ages—Centuries—now fled— Politics— Laws— Religions have   multiplied- Empires— Kingdoms— States— Repub[l]ics have   filled the world. But whare— O whare!— The keys powers     
 Religion knowledge or Government of God— Our puriton Fathers   fled to the American wilderness to rid themselves from the corr  uption of ages. Their children made a Government wise &   Free. But—Alas— The Priesthood—The Power—The Religion   of Heaven had long since been lost to man— Prophets &   Apostles were no more — Our Fathers knew this — And tharefore   as wise honest & consistent men they refrained from man  ufacturing a State Religion.      Again were the heavens opened. The Silence of Ages was broake[n]   The gloom of overhanging night was pierced with a ray from   the worlds of Endless day. A Celestial spark from the heavenly   Altar was rekindled upon the Earth. The mystic veil was rent   in twain. And the fogs & mysts of long Ages began to roll away   as the gloom of a long night before the rising dawn. In the midst   of the ownly great & free nation upon the Earth the God of Abraham   raised up a mighty Prophet gave him the ancient keys   of Religion, Government & power & Restored the Apostleship   with its keys of Revelation vision & Prophecy. Through the   administration of which the laws & government were restored   to man & his Kingdom organized upon the Earth no more   to be thronewn down. People, Magestrates, Senators, Govornors,   & States have opposed its progress with fire & sword & death   but all in vain. It has waded through calumny hate & oppression   & blood & fire & martyrdom Till it organized itself amid   the strong holds of these Eternal Mountains & Stood forth   a Noble spectacle for the wonder & admiration of all Nations   A Government created by Heaven preserved by the matchless   power of the Almighty & led and id instructed by Prophets &   Apostles with the keys of Revelation. The United States   were constrained to recognize & sustain that which no   human power could subdue. Hence the Territorial Govern-  ment of Utah. And Hence the local capacity in which   we are now siting as Senators & Representitives to give   Laws to a Territory. In our Local, political capacity   Executive, Legislative & Judicial we are limited to the geogra-  phical boundaries prescribed by the act of Congress in this   sens our Jurisdiction is bounded by Oregon On the North   by Calafornia on the West by 37 of North Lat on the South   and by the snow clad sumits of the Backbone of our continent   On the East & thus confined in its immediate bearing to a   country not much larger than the British Isles      But the Eyes of the Nations are upon us, we are a city on   a hill a candle on a candlestick that cannot be hid   The great the noble of heart, the Enterprising, the oppressed   of all Nations will flow to us as a continues stream   Senators Govornors Kings & Rulers will cast their   Eyes to Utah & to her Prophets, Apostles, Revelations   laws & institutions as a model a pattern in miniature   for the renovation of the world. In our capacity as   Prophets Apostles & Elders we have the keys of Authority   to Organize & give laws form & constitution to a thousand   local governments like this. Yes Mr President it is ourse  to teach Judges How to rule, To give Senators wisdom & to   repprove instruct & impart wisdom to Presidents and Kings     
 It is ours to impart wisdom & knowledge & strength &   salvation to the Rulers & people of the great Nation which  gave us birth. Untill they know this & seek it at our  hands they will never arise to any considerable degree  of permanent prosperity & peace. But On the contrary  vexation Disunion perplexity division is their doom and   bloody wars & pestilence & storms & fires & whirlwinds  & tempest Earthquakes & famines will continue to waste  them till they shall be constrained to acknowledge the  hand of God & to humble themselves as in the dust &  seek wisdom & instruction at the hand of prophets &  Apostles as did Kings & rulers in days of Old. Untill  like Nebuchadnezzar they shall acknowledge that God  is a Revelator a worker of signs & wonders and an  originator & controllor of political Governments.  Yes Mr President Our Nation & the world shall be  b taught by the prophets & all Nations feel the influence   of the Institutions now being developted in thes Halls of liberty  the chambers of the Eternal Mountains of Deserett  Let the United States go on in their course own strength  without the inspiration & institutions of the Almighty now  offered them by our Prophets let them spread abroad  their dominions on evry side. Let the principles of conquest   or of annexation add the Canadies British Amarica and   even Greenland on the North, Spanish & Portugue Amarican  to cape horn on the South. The west Indies on the East & the  Isles of the Pacific including Japan on the west Let these  countries be gathered under the wings of the wide spread Eagle  & let them be peopled by the Enterprising of all Nations by  Hundreds of Millions. Let their rich & almost boundless resources  be developed by all these & still remain Ignorant &   destitute of the keys of knowledge & power which lead &   govern the destinies of Deseret or of Utah yet shall   the Institutions of that same Utah or of her people outweigh  all this have more present influence in the Destinies of  the world and abide & give Laws & Religion to Man when  the best of mere human, civil, Political, Moral, social and   Religious Institutions has sceased to be and its memory  ownly shadowed forth in the dim History of the past.      * as was^is^ predicted by the Ancient Prophets Though   Heaven & Earth should be moved from their foundations  Though the bright lumainary of Day should refuse  its light. The moon cease to fullfill its monthly ordinan[ce]  and yonder Stars be hurled from their places spheres  yet the Government the Nationality the priesthood   the Oracles, the Religion, the Throne of Israel should  never be removed, a man be wanting to fill that Throne   or a priest to minister at the alter of her Holy Temple.  All nations would have to come to worship before the  Lord and from this center they would have drawn their  light & power. Their Kings chosen & anointed and   instructed by her Prophets & Apostles would have esstablished  peace & Equity & Justice & truth in the Earth. In short ther[e] [page torn]     
 would have been One Lord & his name one in all the Earth  but the Jews rebelled against their King & prefered their  own powerless forms of religion. Jesus & his Apostles on  this account removed from their midst the Keys of Gove  rnment & power & left them a prey to civil war  pestilance & famine & to the raviges of the Romans After the  over throw of the Jews the Romans were suffered to imbrue  their hands in the blood of Apostles Prophets & Saints till  none to remain who possedssed the keys of religion and  government. It was then the powers of darkness triump-  hed upon our Earth. Self constituted Government and  human religions overran our Earth. Truth was banished   & fled far away. Equity could not Enter. Justice was   paralized & stood Aghast. Mercy retireing droped a tear  of blood.)      [FIGURE] E T Benson continued   from 6 pages back   Ask whatsoever you will and it shall   be ours my love for the quorum of the  Twelve Apostles & the First Presidency is far above the love of women  {You may take the most virtuous woman on earth into your bosom and there is something [illegible] in it.} There is not  exhisting with the most virtuous man on Earth (while destitute of the  priesthood & Holy Ghost) that spirit of life that there is with the  servant of God. My ownly hope is with you it is life when we met   & life when we part He closed with Thanksgiving & blessings      Lorenzo Snow next followed & said he felt some as Amasa  did know not whare to begin He felt that his sentiments & feelings  were shadowed forth in his labours. I have great Joy in meeting  with you & beholding your faces & contemplating the influence & power  of this quorum & the greatness of their work I anticipate much   this winter in our meetings & in enjoying the blessings of God. I have  rejoiced this night to hear the exhalted expressions of the quorum   in rendering thanksgiving to God & not one word of complaint or hardships  imprisionments or affliction of any king but are filled with  hidden Joy & pleasure. I feel determin to do all the work that is  assigned me that I may be worthy of a place in this quorum  I felt thankful to hear the blessings pronounced upon us bo [by] our  president He closed with Joy & Thanksgiving      W. Woodruff addressed the quorum upon the importance of ther  writing. the importance of their keeping a private History of ther  lives labour & ministry, & als[o] a Joint History of the Quorum   of the Twelve Apostles He said he had ever been inspired since  He had ben a member of the Church not ownly to write   all of his own acts & life, but to write all the sermons teachings  & prophesies of the prophet Joseph, president Brigham Young &  counsel & of the Twelve Apostles as far as he was acquainted  with their labour He said each member of the quorum should  keep an account of their missions, works miracles & the bless-  ings of God unto them. And that the history of the quorum of the  Twelve could now be easily obtained but if we omitted it untill  we were dead our friends could not get it correctly before the  world      P. P. Pratt spoke of the filling up of the quorum of the 12 in 1848  & of their commencement of a record of the quorum & wishes it      
 continued. He said he did not know how far & minute we ought  to be in writing a Journal but thinks we ought to record our   official acts & considers it for our interest as well as duty thus to  do      E. T. Benson said that President Richards wished him   to requst the young members of this quorum to hand to him   a short statement of their lives & ministry the time they recvd  the gospel &c to go into the Church History      G. A. Smith W. Woodruff & P P Pratt interchanged a few words  upon the subject of Journal keeping &c      F. D. Richards next spoke & said he felt highly to participate  in the common Joy of the evening & felt it was an omin of the  times, an eventful epok in the last dispensation to us & the world.  I feel behind most of the quorum in not having the privilege of so  much counsel & teaching from Brother Joseph as they. when I  contemplate the future I feel that the field of our labour was equal  to the Noblest amibition which man could entertain both in this world  & in the next felt his Joy tempered in the recollection      O. Hyde said while I have been listening I have had an unusual  train of reflection of necessity we shall soon be called again to  separate & the Kingdoms of this world must become the Kingdoms of  our Lord & his Christ. we are trained in the school of experience  I may live to see you all in different parts of the Earth & while the Kingdoms   of the Earth are falling you will in many instances be enabled to stretc  out your hands & give counsel & save many people & be enabled to   rule governments & thus fulfilll the prophesies, & many of thes  things are not afar off. All is Eternity to us whether this or   the other side of the veil. we are born in Eternity, & let us be  whare we will, it will be our calling to win souls to Christ  The Presidency are unwell or they would be here. I wish the  Journals of the Twelve to be written up so they can be on hand  when Needed to be published I wish each one of the quorum wold  write as good an Epistle as they are capable of & have then put  in book form & send them forth unto the world      P P. Pratt Thingks the subject is abounding in us & we owe  the world a testimony not as individuals but as a quorum   of the Twelve Apostles & suggest that each contributes & write  an Epistle & form the whole & compile & embody a Book to  go forth with the signatures of all the quorum as the combined  History of all the ^12^ Apostles      G. A. Smith thinks it vary important that an Authentic   History of each member should be preserved      W. Woodruff made mention of certain items which he consid[ered]  necessary in the preservation of our History He lamented that  David W. Patten had not left any record of his life for he   was a prophet & an Apostle & a mighty man. many miracles  were wrought by him in his ministry. He told a rich man   in Tennessee who fought the work of God that he & his family  should beg their bread Robert. C. Petty saw that same man  cry at a blacksmith shop because he could not get trusted     
 to have his plough sharp[en]ed      President Orson Hoyde moved that Wilford Woodruff   be the clerk & historian of the Twelve Apostles carried unan-  imously      P P Pratt proposed a new Record & wished that the Nar  ative of each of the quorum of the Twelve be first recorded   in it begining with the president of the quorum & going through   in rotation with each member as he stands in the quorum      W Woodruff says he is willing to serve the quorum as Historian   as faithfully as he can. although it will be a heavy tax upon   his time      E Snow enquires if this history contemplated is confined to the   present quorum or of the members from the begin[in]g P. P. Prat   thinks it should include the present quorum merely E Snow   would like to see included all that could be found of D W.   Patten. C. C. Rich said he heard Brother Patten say the   morning that he was martered that the Kingdom of God shall   be delive[re]d or he should lay down his life. P P Pratt wished   Brother Woodruff to leave all temporal business as much as   possible & bring this history up. A Lyman says their is no   date of his ordination. O Hyde proposed for the Twelve to me[e]t   with the Presidency & also to meet each week for mutual   exchange of thought      Adjourned to meet one week from to night at this place      December 23, 1852 ~ Thursday to December 25, 1852 ~ Saturday      Dec 23, 24, 25 I spent the time in the Legislature on Christmas the   25 I attended the dedication of the school House in the 14 ward      December 26, 1852 ~ Sunday      276th Sunday I spent the time at home writing      December 27, 1852 ~ Monday to December 30, 1852 ~ Thursday      27, 28, 29, 30, I spent the time in the Legislature      December 31, 1852 ~ Friday      31 [FIGURE] I wrote a letter to I F Carter & sent him an account of   the money I had sent him it went via Calafornia      The quorum of the Twelve met on the 29th Dec & spent the   evening in conversation abot laying some plan to liberate   ourselves & familyies so we can be foot loose & go & preach   the gospel & leave a support for ourselves & families speches   were made by all the quorum present upon the subject      On the next sunday Jan 2nd 1853 President Brigham Young   & H.

B  Marsh once said he did not know what Joseph called the  Twelve for without it was to abuse them I told him if the   Twelve were faithful they would soon see the day that they   would have all the influence they could wield that day has come   He said laying plans in our present situation for perpetuity   was all a shadow we may lay plans but they may be frustrated      On the last day of Dec 1852 I looked over my Jounal &   recorded on the following page the result of my labour &c

 WILFORD WOODRUFF'S   JOURNAL   FOR   1853     
 January 1, 1853 ~ Saturday      JAN 1st 1853 The commencement of a new year   in the midst of a New Era. O how time   flies and how great, how important how magnificent, and how   mighty are the Events born on its wings it is the opening of a dispen  sation that swallows up all other dispensations since the world   began the deeds of the last thousand years sink into insigniff-  icans in comparrison to the work of a year at the present time   The Heavens gaze upon the scenes as they pass with deep interes   while the whole Earth beholds the scenes in wonder & amacement  The ancients Prophets saw by vision & revelation the scenes which   were to follow each other in quick succession in this age in the   esstablishment of the great Kingdom of our God to be thrown   down no more forever. The little stone cut out of the mountain   without hands that was to roll forth untill it became a mountain   & filled the whole Earth & broke in peaces & subdued all other   kingdoms & was to stand forever as seen by the prophet Daniel   has commenced its work. that Church & Kingdom of God is   now on the Earth & is being esstablished which must endure & the   world are gaziong upon it, it is now located in these vallies of the   mountains like a city set upon a hill which cannot be hid. its   first Prophet & Founder has laid down his life in its defence   He has been martered, & his blood is crying from the ground   for vangance upon a great Nation. many others have fallen   a martyr to the truth & the gospel of Jesus Christ since the organiza-  tion of this church in A.D. 1830 & many others may, yet the   Church is bound to arise & prosper untill the Zion & Kingdom   of our God shall stand forth in bold relief containing all that   power, strength, might, majesty & dominion which God has   decreed concerning her & been spoken through the mouths of   his Holy Prophets since the world began. This Church & Kingdom   has continued steadily to arise since its first organization amid   oppostion, oppression, persecution, & martyrdom untill it has become   esstablished in the midst of thes everlasting hills & mountains not ownly   gaining strength in church but also in state. Ephraims Nobles are   of himself & his Govonor has procedid out of the midst of him. And   while truth inspires my heart shall I fear to write it MShall I fear   that the present or future Generations shall read those truths which   are burning in my breast enkindled by the Holy Alters of Heaven No   God forbid for the voice of truth whispers to me that Our Govornors   Presidents & senators now arising out of the Kingdom of God will   be inspired to take bold measures, to perform daring acts, rise   up in their stregngth & power & stregth [stretch] forth their strong arms   & save from annihilation that Holy instrument the Constitutin   of the United States. which the American People are about to sell   for a mess of potage & triying to consine it to the grave. Their is a   power who has decreed that liberty freedom & the rights of the   Righteous & the meeke of the Earth shall not wholey die & that power   is God. And He has decreed to inspire & nerve up the Soul the   sinew & the Arm of his Govornors Senators & prophets &   Arm them for the contest, and defend them in their warfare   That Nation or Kingdom or Toungue or people, from this time forth   who shall rise up against Zion & the Church & Kingdom of God   to oppress her. They shall be visited by the Judgments of the   Most High they shall be overthrown & brought to desolation & may   God spedily Hasten it May the Almighty begin this year to rend the kingdoms   of this world with his Servants & continue it untill all nations shall acknowled[ge] ther is   a God in Israel     
 Jan 1st 1853 The quorum of the Twelve Apostles met at the Council   House at 8 oclok being eleven in number the whole quorum except Elder   Orson Pratt (who is at Washington preaching the gospel) The quorum marched   to President Brigham Youngs & wished him a Happy New Year President   Young received them with Joy & gladness & after the greetings were over   President Young asked what he should treat them with. The senti-  ment was instanteneous in the hearts of all the quorum & spoken by president   Orson Hyde, treat us with your blessings then President Young blessed the   quorum of the Twelve & said they always had his blessings. And the Twelve   Apostles felt & realized that the blessings of the Presidency of the Church  & Kingdom of God was of far more worth & benefit to them than any   Earthly gift or the Treasures of the Earth their hearts were full of joy   & gladness which was unspeakable at the blessing of once more having   the privilege of returning from the four corners of the Earth & beholding each   others faces & sitting in council together & meeting with the president   & his counsel & receiving blessings at their hands. The Twelve left their blessgs   upon President Young & his house while the Twelve were paying their respts   to President Young the band was playing a lively tune in front of the House   the quorum saluted the two bands with a Happy New Year & received in   return some excellent music. The quorum then visited President Heber  C Kimball & wished him a happy new Year. He also received   the Twelve with Gladness & gave unto them his blessings which was also  highly prized. In his blessings unto them he said his faith & feelings were   that no one of the present quorum of Apostles should ever fall & no power   should ever take their Crown & Kingdom but they should come forth  in the morning of the first Resurrection & be exhalted to glory immortal-  ity & Eternal lives, and their blessings should increase from this time   henceforth & for ever & they should not want bread but they should   have means to support themselves & families. My Feelings have ever   been good towards this quorum & ever will be. The Twelve left their  blessings upon presidet Kimball & household. And next visited Father   John Smith the aged Patriarch & wished him a happy New Year. He   manifested much Joy & satisfaction in seeing Eleven of the Twelve   Apostles beneath his roof. This venerable Patriarch also bestowed upon   the Twelve his blessing, & said they should live to see the Kingdom of God ^& Zion^ ess  tablished to be thrown down no more forever & that none of them should   ever fall but should have part in the first resurrection, no power should  take their crown but they should be blessed in all their labours in   the Earth & that the blessings of God should increase upon them from   this time forth both temporal & spiritual. The Apostles also left their  blessings upon the Patriarch & his household they next visited President   Willard Richards He also received them with Gladness & an open hart  they wished him a Happy new year. He also gave the Twelve his  blessing He believed this is a begining of an Eventful year in the History   of this Church & kingdom on the Earth & he believed each suceeding    year would be more & more so untill the coming of the son of man  He said the Twelve were ever before him in his thoughts prayers &   blessings notwithstanding they might be scattered to the fore cornors of the Earth  they were men of God & were destined to perform a great & mighty work in   the Earth & they should live till they were satisfyed with life they should  see light & truth prevail over sin tradition & Error & triumph in the Earth.  The Twelve next went to the house of Elder P. P Pratt & there united with his family in singing the return   of the Twelve & other songs of Zion. The spirit & power of God rested upon the quorum of the   Twelve while their hearts were filled with praise & thanksgiving to God in all their visits   on this the new year of 1853. The bands also continued their salutations to Presidents Kimball   Richards & Patriarch Smith & many others in various parts of the City & their enlivening  music was evry whare received with open ears & harts of Joy God bless the bands

Martin   Luther with others created a great change in his day from   Popary, to more freedom of conscience in religious & political   matters & the way has been prepared in process of time so the   kingdom of God has been esstablished & so with all the events of   the present day steem power, rail roads Telegraph lines, & all the   Revolutions of the present Nations may we not acknowledge the  hand of God in them all as bringing to pass the purposes of the   Lord. The Lord says he is angry with none exsept those who do   not acknowledge his hand in all things No man can find out God  we shall not noknow as much as God for then there would would  be two competitors on the Throne we may see the day when we   shall know as much as God does now but then He will know as much   more at that time than we as he does now. if we do wrong we shall   be chastized for it if we do well we shall have our reward for that     
 P. P. Pratt followed & said how could doors be open in China   & other parts of the world if God had not moved upon some   of the Nations to cause a change among the nations & to have the  bible printed in the different languages so the people could have   the scriptures to read. After men have published the bible &   got $50,000 dollars for the same if they wont receive the fulness   of the gospel when they hear it the Lord can say to them you   are well paid for what you have done & if you wont do any more   go your way I will raise up somebody else so dont you complain as   you have got your pay I fell thankful for a few truths that are abr[oa]d  in the world as it prepares the way for many more      Brother A Lyman followed & said he was glad to hear what   had been said He felt to acknowledge the hand of God in all things many   might say we would have bettered our condition if we had gone to   Calafornia but if you had gone there you would have gone whare   the devil would have had a chance to have spewed his filth over you   fo it would have been like going into the midst of hell some complan   about these Hills, deserts & mountains it is in consequence of these   things that we are here if we were in a desireable spot whare   the gentiles would wish to occupy it we would have trouble   from them & these are some of the things we ought to be thakful   for those persons that would be discontented with this people   would be discontented in paradise & they might have the   making of it themselves it would add much to the happiness   of mankind if they would be submissive to those powers which   they cannot controll but which ought to controll them      I met in councel with the Presidency & Twelve in the Afternoon   for prayer.

 January 30, 1853 ~ Sunday      Jan 30th Sunday P. P. Pratt preached. his subject was the   Kingdom of God which was to be set up in the last days He   said if we were to take the present order rules & regulations   of either the Jews, Gentiles Christian or pagan as as Standrd  standard to set up as the patern for the great Kingdom of our   God of which the prophets had spoken their was none of the   which would fit compare or answer the purpose at all for the   last dispensation when did we ever see a generation or any   Nation make their own prophets & Apostles to get Revelation   & do the wok of God. In order to set up a kingdom & gov[ernme]nt   in the last days to gather the 10 Tribes of Israel the Jews & gentiles   & all Nations break down the Romon power build up   esstablish Zion & maintain it. it must be sumthing diff[ere]nt   from any Human government or device of man it must   originate from the heavens be governed & controlled by the   God of heaven led by inspiration & Revelation in all of its   undertakings & it must contain within itself all the blessings   & covenants which God made to Abraham concerning his   seed & posterity. This Kingdom is here in the valley of the   mountains it has been esstablished by the hand of God and   it embraces all that God has promised, or that is necessary to  perfect the great work or all that Jew or Gentile can look for  it embraces the whole of the New & everlasting covenant the fulness   of the gospel, with all the power & Authority of the same the   Keys of the Kingdom the endowments sealing powers the patriarchal   Matrimony & the foundation laid for gathering all Israel.      The Ancient deciples & Apostles did not set up this   Kingdom as some have supposed when they inquired of   Jesus if he would at that time restore again the Kingdom to   Israel Jesus informed them that it was not given to   them to know (even) the times & seasons which the Lord   had reserved unto himself when he would set up the   Kingdom so they were not permitted to know the time   much less to perform the work They asked the Saviour   what they should do then He told them they should bear   witness of his name before both Jew & gentile & for   this same testimony they would have to lay down their lives  the Kingdom of God was set up in their day but the people   would not permit it to remain long among [them] for they killed   the prophets, Apostles, & Elders who preached the gospel of the   kingdom of the Kingdom of God & the priesthood & Kingdom   of God was taken from them & they have fallen into darkness &   Error. But now the Kingdom of God is set up for the last time   to again restore Israel & you cannot force Israel even   by the sword to receive a Kingdom & Laws & acknowledge the   great standard which is to be set up in the last days for the   governing gathering & controlling of all Israel except it   is right & according to the promises made to the Fathers & this   Kingdom of God when it was to appear was to be like a mustard   seed it was to be the least of all herbs but was to grow untill the   folls fowls of heaven lodged in the branches thereoff. should we   attempt to take any of the Kingdoms of the world as this great   standard out of which to build the Kingdom of God it would not   compare at all with the parable given. but when we take     
 the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints it does compare   in every respect & contains within itself evry thing that is promis   in the great standard that was to be set up in the last days it is no   matter what this is called at the present time a church a republic   or a Kingdom. the Kingdom is certainly here & in vary deed   it has commenced like a mustard seed vary small but as the seed   gathers its seed mosture from the Earth which causes it to spring forth   & take root so will this Kingdom continue to gather the good from   all Nations untill it becomes the greatest of All Kingdoms under   Heaven & untill the Kingdoms of this world become the Kingdom   of our God & his Christ the signs of this Kingdom are appearing in   the heavens & the Earth that was spoken off by Christ & the Apotles   & why should not the Kingdom appear some may say I have been   Baptized Joined the church am in the Kingdom Now why may not   I go to Calafornia & get gold & take all the comfort I can in this   world well if one part of the Kingdom of God have a right to   go the whole have & scatter abroad then whare is your Kingdom   & gathering we are now in as good a place as we can get in  if we were to go to calafornia we would be whare we would   be in the midst of the scum of Hell. If we should go to Cal   or New Orlens because we could get sugar for 3 cts whare would   the work of the Kingdom of God be my views are that when   we are gathered we keep so & build up Temples give Endowments to   the living & dead except as we go on missions abroad in the   world as the Angels would go to hell on a mission & [be] glad to   return as soon as they got through. If you want gold build   up the Kingdom of God make Zion a city on a hill that cannot   be hid & carry out the purposes of the Lord & then gold will   flow in unto you from all Nations your Presidency & Apostles   will then hardly have time to go out of the Temple to get their   breakfast instead of runing about to know how to get their land   ploughed so as to raise bread to eat & while all Nations are brea  king up[.] the rich am[on]g them will invest their wealth among the   institution of Zion & not trust it among the sinking Nations   & those that wished to save their lives will flee to Zion for safety   for they will be the ownly people that will not be at war one   with another many other Edifying remrks were mad by the speakr      Elder Amasa Lyman followed & said that the members of   this Kingdom possessed that faith & knowledge that if all the   world would say they did not believe it it would not make   any difference with them for they know of its truths The   sectarian world can write & say many putty things but   why do they not carry them into practice the main difficulty   is their is no nucleus around which to gather, in order to   practice what they preach. but we believe that when God said   he would set up a kingdom which should break in peaces   all other Kingdoms & stand forever that He will perform what   He has spoken. The Lord has said that that Nation that   fought against Zion should be broaken in peaces & utterly   wasted away & while the Elders are gathering the Saints from   all Nations & Kingdoms & will continue untill the winding up   scene we can make some calculation what Zion is destined   to be. many other remarks were made by Brother Lyman     
 I attended prayer meeting with the Presidency & Twelve in the Af-  ternoon & I preached in the evening to a full House in the 14th   ward school House I also spoke upon the kingdom of God  said that none of the words of the Lord spoken would retu-  rn unto him void but would accomplish all that he had   declaired that the Elders were gaining more strength &   confidence & power, in declairing the Kingdom of God to   the world. I confirmed one member of the Chuch      January 31, 1853 ~ Monday      31st & 32 I spent the time at home writing      February 1, 1853 ~ Tuesday      Feb 1st I spent the day writing we had a hard snow storm   at night      February 2, 1853 ~ Wednesday      2nd [FIGURE] I wrote a Letter to Benjamin Baker      February 3, 1853 ~ Thursday to February 5, 1853 ~ Saturday      3, 4 5. I spent the time writing my byography      February 6, 1853 ~ Sunday      6th Sunday I attended meeting Elder Lorenzo Snow preached  He spoke vary well exhorted the saints to faithfulness the   young men to study the different languages that they might   be useful among the Nations He exhorted the saints that was expetg [expecting]   to stay in the valley to do all they could to forward the work of God He said   if any of the brethren wanted to be marterd or lay down their   lives for Christ sake they can have a chance by going to   Europe or some of those foreign Nations He said that after   the Danish Government had banished the Amarican Elders from   the Kingdom that the native brethren said to the poliece the   seed is sown the truth is here it is in our hearts & we are here   ourselves & shall defend the truth many interesting remarks   were maid by Brother Snow      President B Young followed & said the organization   of man is one of the deepest subjects that the phylosopher of the   day attempt to investig[at]e the mystery of man in his organiza  tion has been a study for ages it has been a mystery but it   is because of ignorance their is no such thing as mystery or miracle   ownly to the ignorant any intelligent being that knows the   caus & effect of things it is no myracle or mystery it is our   privilege to asspire after that knowledge that the greatest intel  igance possesses we should take that course that we may ever   increase in knowledge than we are sure of exhaltation  why I make mention of this thing is because I look   upon this people who are now before me I am like the   rest of you that when the light of truth shines upon me   my mind enlightened and I am asstonished to look at   the world of mankind their actions are like little Children  you look at your children about the House & you will see pe[r]fect  pattern of the world the children will fight & cry about &   after evry thing that they ought not to have they want a looking   glass hammer razor & many things that they would injure   themselves & are not old enough to handle so it is with all  the world if they had all their desires granted them they   would leap deaches, fences, hedges & gutters & go to hell across   lots & never wait to take the road even old men like children   will ask for things they cannot use and I can see the same     
 in this Church many of the people ask for things they cannot  handle I see it evry day. I wish to exhort the people here to an  item of our religion yet I am happy to say that the item that   I am about to exhort you to the people generally are ready to carry  out firstly I would say let us observe the mormon creed let  evry mind their own business evry one has weeds enough in   his own guarding to attend to without attending to the weeds   in his Neighbors garden for while you are attending to  the weeds of your Neighbor those in your own will grow vary  thick & tall & will finally spoil the good seed I am asstonished   that the people do not see that they can get along much better  without doing evil than with. if a person does you an injury dont  retaliate & you get a great advantage of the person doing the evil  if a person injures you do him good & you get the advantage  of him & the victory. Follow the counsel of Brother Snow and   improve your time in study & treasureing up knowledge childn  should have their times of recreations for if they are kept still  from seeing & knowing any thing appertaining to amusements till  they are 18 yars of age when they do get out they will act   vary wild. but let the children sow their wild oats do up the  dancing & frolicking while young that when they get older they m[a]y  read the Bible Book of Mormon & preach the gospel & do goog [good] on  the Earth I want to know all their is on Earth in Heaven  & Hell so that no person shall know more than I do but   in obtaining this knowledge I do not wish to sin their is   no need of singing.      If the weather had been good I should have called upon  the people to have commenced diging out the foundation of the Temple  I want to lay the cornor stone of the Temple on the 6th day of next   April if the Lord will if you want to know what size I am  calculating to build the Temple I will say I am expecting to  break ground 150 feet by 220 And the foundation for  the building to stand upon 20 feet deep & 20 feet wide  & 10 feet high the basement story will then commence on   the top of the foundation & that will be 16 feet high 8 feet under  ground & 8 feet above then the main building will commence  on the top of the basement story. what is there here in this  valley that should hendor this people from being happy I am   happy because I do not fret about any thing that I cannot   do. I wont fret about any thing what henders your  praying & praising God No body but your own selves if you  are seeking to weed your neighbors garden you will have  business enough. but this is a happy people I wish they   would prize their blessings. You have not got to mourn   as did the Ancients because their children would Apostitise  turn from God & be cursed Our children will not Apostitze  they will not have time but will have all they can do to perform  the work of God as it rolls upon them to prepare the kingdom   for the coming of Christ gather up the Nations &c Then be   happy & do the things required of you      I attended the prayer meeting in the Afternoon And preached  to the 14 ward school House in the evening to a crouded House  I took for my text the mormon creed mind your own   business I told them what our own business was to preach     
 the gospel to the Nations of the Earth gather Israel & build up Zion  weed our own gardens & let our neighbors alone. dont interfere  with your neighbors affairs for that is his business & not ours      February 7, 1853 ~ Monday      7th I walked to Snows herd ground & back distance of the day 20.      February 8, 1853 ~ Tuesday to February 9, 1853 ~ Wednesday      8, 9. I spent the day at home writing      February 10, 1853 ~ Thursday      10th I spent this day at home writing      February 11, 1853 ~ Friday      Feb 11th [FIGURES] This was a painful day I was called at about 1 oclok  this morning to administer to sister Rhodes who had   been labouring in Child birth for two days she was nearly worn out   as she could not be deliverd. Brother Franklin Richards with myself  administerd to her but she died at 2 oclock amid the greatest Agiony I closed  her eyes. At 3 oclock PM. there was a Post Mortom examination made  the Presidency and several of the Twelve were present the surgical operation  was performed by Dr Andrews and no blame was attached to the mid   wives who officiated {the following is the result of the examination the child lay across the womb with own hand   oblong the head lay on the right side the feet on the left the child had torn the womb to pieces   with his feet and the afterbirth so if the child had been born the woman   could not live the doctor gave the following instructing to the women if the child presents feet   first put a hand into the womb and bring out the child feet first and if the child's face is turned   so the chin would hook under the [illegible] bone turn the child with the face   towards the back bone then it can be born if the child's feet come doubled up put up the hand   and bring down one limb at a time in the womb and turn the child he said the woman's   [feelings] should not be consulted at such times but the midwife should use their own [illegible]}      February 12, 1853 ~ Saturday      12th [FIGURE] I attended sister Rhodes Funeral The President Twelve   & a large congregation of people assembled and President Young   preached & said that the few remarks I have to make I will endeavor  to speak to the point my text is it is better to go to the house of mour-  ning than to the House of feasting for that is the end of all men & the living  will lay it to heart. When we are in a situation so that we cannot   know any thing ownly what we know by the natural senses it causes  us to mourn the loss of friends but if we could understand all   things it would often times be a source of Joy instead of morning  when a spirit enters a tabernacle here in this life it enters   into a state of sorrow yet if we understood things in their   tru light we should be satisfyed with it. When the spirit  enters the body it enters a dark sell and is left to sorrow &  to be tried in all things but when the spirit leaves the body if   a saint it enters into the brilliant light and glory of God like  taking a prisioner out of a dark sell whare he could see a  little glimmer of light through the grates & put him into the  blaze of the mid days sun. when we loose our Friends we mourn  but what is it that mourns is it that light, truth and intellige[nce]  of the Almighty that is in man that mourns No it is the grocer  part of our being that mourns let a person be unclothed and  we could see the spirit of our sister and all other friends & shake  hands with them & spirit be tangible to each other as our bodies  now are to each other when I am filled with the spirit of God   I can see men and what is in them and the more we are in  refined in spirit the more we can see the reason I cannot shake   hands with Sister Rhodes is becaus of this gross body. Women  were not made to die in child bed as Sister Rhodes has done  but what is the matter death is here it is death that has caused  it death is in the land around us it is here Children die before they  are born this because their is death around us we cannot     
 se it we have the Head ake we cannot se that (yet it exist) because we are  in the body but if we were out of the body we could se it we should advance  in the phylosophy of Eternal things and learn as we live when  we go to the House of feasting we go to feast our bodies when we go to the  house of mourning we mourn as it were in spirit and our minds   are called to serious truths but what would really be a case of  mourning it would be to follow a person to the grave who had not  improved their day of salvation had an oppertunity of being saved  & exhalted & had neglected it that would be a case of mourning but  a person that had done the best they could & improved their oppor-  tunities of salvation we have no cause to mourn for such I would   say to the children dont mourn for your mother I would to God you was  as sure of salvation as your mother is If I was to mourn for any thing  in this case it would be because we have not more power to   cast the devil out of the house and out of the Neighborhood. Can we  realize that sister Rhodes is not dead she lives now more  than she did before it is the sinner that will die not the Righteous  when the spirit of this woman left the body it was ushered into  a flood of light but her body is as any other clay but her spirit  is in open day she saw a little light in the body so as not to put her eye  out when she came to the full light      I wish to give a little counsel to the children here Brother Snow will  take charge of the place I want the children to go to school and   want an inventory of things here taken for the benefit of   Brother Rhodes & brother Snow both I request the children to do  as well as your mother has done according to the light you have &  I will warrant you salvation & Eternal life & I would say   the same to all who are here but upon no other principle  can I warrant anybody salvation exsept upon the principle  of doing good & obeying the Lord do good to your families & to  each other. I want to say to all present there is no blame to be  attached to any of the sisters who waited upon Sister Rhodes they  have all done as well as they could for I have enquired into   the whole affair & her time had come to die & so will [yours]  in its turn.      February 13, 1853 ~ Sunday      13th Sunday Meeting was addressed in the morning B[y] Brother Joseph   Young He spoke of the blessings of the people it was not wealth &   riches that made men happy but it was by having the truth & obey-  ing if this people are called a happy people well they are in a great  measure yet many of the saints have disappointment in their path  yet we should trust all our affairs in the hands of god we should  do right & follow the counsel of those that are set over us & carry  out their views & the blessing of God will attend us & we shall be happy      J. M. Grant followed and said he hoped all would  attend to their prayers it takes as much to damn a man as it  does to save him some wonder why we dont have revelation  now in our day as well as in the days of Joseph. in his day the bretn  would not build a log cabin till they went to Joseph to ask counsel  how they should set it whare they should put the door &c but at   the present day men have learned to do sumthing themselves without  troubling the president or the Lord about it some have thought if they  could get to Jackson Co Mo or in this valley they would be Holy & amdng [and among]  a Holy people but I do not know of any soil that will make men     
 Holy if men are not Holy themselves I dont know of any particular   spot of ground that will make them so. Joseph had to give written   Revelation to get men to go on missions but I do not believe that any   men were ever called more by Revelation or as much as any   that were ever called to go on a mission to preach the gospel than   were our Brethren last fall nor do I believe any men wer filled   more with Revelation & inspiration in blessing those set apart then   were our Brethren who blessed those set apart last fall their is no   other kingdom like this on the Earth the Ancient Apostles had no more   of the spirit of God to prepare them for their work then our Apostles   have for the work which they have to perform in our day I would   say that the dispensation of Moses & Christ & the Apostles looks like this dis-  pensation though this dispensation will eclips all other dispensations   for it is the finishing up of the building Moses never began to do what   we have to do. I am of the opinion that men that are our prophets   Apostles & leaders that have laid the foundation of this Church & kingdom   & are building upon it were reserved forom Eternity to come forth   in this dispensation to accomplish the great work which is to be   done neve[r] did men live with more nerve desission of character   perseverance faith & power than those that lead this dispensation  Had they have lived in the days of the Apostles they would have raised   the devil with both Jew & Gentile. Had they have lived in the days of   Moses they would have raised the vary Devil with the Canaanites   & various Nations. the commencement of this Church & Kingdom   may not appear as great as it did in the days of Moses & Christ & the   Apostles but look at the progress of this kingdom. & the deeds & work   of Our leaders & the people are startling. even their exidous out of   the states to these mountains & the results that have & will follow   are greater than the results that followed Moses & the Israelites a  mighty great Nation have sent their Judges & rulers to us They   did not behave themselvs as they should do we cast them out &   sent them home if all the world was consolodated into one Nati[on]   & sent delegates & rulers unto us if they run against the priest-  hood & infringed upon our rights we would cast them out &   send them home regardless of consequences we know what the   consequences are.      I want to say to the mass of the saints here   you do not keep up with the Presidency of this Church & those   that are associated with him & if you are not careful I fear   they will get out of sight of you & perhaps be translated & leve   you I pray God to keep you in the path of duty so that you may   inherit all the blessings that are promised you      President Young Kimball followed & said he believed we had more to do than   other dispensations yet they had the Keys of the kingdom if they   had not had them they could not have given them to us Jesus says my   sheep hear my voice & will follow me if they dont pray I   think they are not the sheep of Christ if you dont ask the savio  saviour for what you want how do you expect to get it then ask   the Lord for what you want Brother Brigham holds the Keys of   this Kingdom & no body els holds them as he does others hold   keys but they hold them under him He holds the keys that Peter   held. some want to go to Calafornia whare it is warmer but   going to Calafornia wont warm your hearts the majority of   this people have great hearts & you want to be able to stand alone   without leaning upon any one if you dont do it you will be apt  to fall if I ever get to glory I expect to be tried some think they     
 been tryed by leaving their homes but how is it you was on other   mens lands & servants & now you have houses & lands of your own  so this was no great trial but a blessing but you have to be tried. we   are going to build up a Temple I expect the devil will kick up a fuss   by & by to try you well Let it come I hope the chaff will be blown  away but when Brother Brigham says build this Temple let us go to   it rit up. Some have asked if we could do any more good in the   States I say yes when those that profess to be saints will gather   out & not much before      B Young followed & said if the people will be on the Temple ground   to morrow at 11 oclok we will break the ground for the commencement   of the foundation of the Temple. I do not believe that Enoch & his   people eincreased in wrighteousnes faith & obedience & improved any   faster than this people have since the commencement of this Kingdom   I said this in the days of Joseph I have no doubt but God expects   us to improve more than any other people that ever lived on the   Earth then let us double our dilligence & let the parents both men   & women never scease untill they govern themselves in all things   and if we are tempted to do wrong never scease untill we conquor   that spirit & bring it in subjection under your feet that you may ere   long become rulers Kings & Priest unto God      February 14, 1853 ~ Monday      [FIGURE] Feb 14th 1853 This was an important and interesting  day to the saints in the valley & even in all the world the saints   met upon the Temple block in a vast body to break the ground   for another Temple the people commenced gathering at an   early hour & at 11 oclok there were thousands upon the   ground President Young & Counsel The quorum of the Twelve   with many of the quorums of the Church were on the ground. All the bands   of music in the City were present. at 11 oclok President Brigham Young   Heber C Kimball & Willard Richards got into a buggy inside   the square surrounded by the quorum of the Twelve President Young   arose and addressed the people and said our history is to well   known for me to speak of it now. We shall now again attempt   to build another Temple we have tried it many times bet have   not been able to finished them so as to occupy them for any length   of time we may not now but we will triy it we may Just as   well build a Temple that will cost a Million of dollars as well   as not & we would be just as well off & better to than before   And I would just as well build a Temple that would cost   a million of Dollars if I knew we should be driven from  it in a month by our enemies as though we should occupy   it a Thousand years it is all the same with me for when the   Lords Commands us to do any thing we should do it just   as freely without asking the whys & wharefore whether we have   the privilege of enjoying it or not. If you ask if it is the will of   God for us to build a Temple I answer yes it is the will of God   we should build a Temple we cannot attend to the ordinances of   the House of the Lord without it. If you ask if I have received a   revelation or vision upon the subject I would answer yes I   have been in vision much of the time upon the subject I knew it   was the will of God that we should build a Temple on thise same   ground when I first came into the valley and while the brethren   were exploring out I said all the time this is the place for the City & Temple     
 it is the will of God that we should do all we can in this valley   & surrounding country for the benefit of the people if the people needed   it I would give them a written Revelation upon this subject   but do you not know that it is your duty to build up Houses for your   own benefit you want a buttery bedrooms & other convenient   rooms in your dwelling house well we want a Temple more   than we want dwelling houses. I will relate some of the sayings   of Joseph while in Kirtland He said conserning the building of that   Temple that it grieved him & also the spirit of God to think that   the saints were not willing to build a Temple by the counsel of the   priesthood without a written revelation & commandment from   God that was it not for the penurious feelings of the people the Lord would   not give revelations & commandments as he does whenever the   Lord finds the people willing to do good build up his Kingdom & do good   without being commanded He will be more pleased with them      I will bring forth my art & plan for a Temple then if any   man can present any better plan or get faith enough to   call to his aid any of the old Nephites or any of the Anci[en]ts   & will present a better plan than mine will be we will   receive it.      A word to the people I wish to ask if you want   a commandment evry year to require you to pay your   Tithing when it is a standing law unto Israel & has been   from the days of Abraham you all know this well if you   dont want to pay your tithing or any portion of you I dont   want you should it is for your good not mine I dont   want a Temple to get my endowments in For I got my   Endowments and all the blessings appertaining thereto under   the hands of Joseph before his death & before the Temple was   built in Nauvoo & so did so my counsellors and a part of the   Tweleve get theirs before the Temple was built. Brother Joseph   seemed urged by the spirit of God to perform this work  had he not have done it he might have died without conferring   the Keys upon others. if this people pay their tithing we   shall have an abundance in the store house to build a   Temple with without giving all you have got yet all   you have should be upon the Alter ready to be offered if   necessary I shall ask the people to come & work out   their Tithing by labour for that is what we want I   believe we shall have your help.      7 years ago tomorrow   at 7 oclok I crossed the Missippi River I believed then   that God had a good place in the mountains for us &   would lead us to it and He has done it for which I feel   thankfurl. if some feel quite sorry for not having the   privilege of suffering with us but I will promise you all   if you will be faithful that you shall have the privilege of   suffering & being tried as much as you will wish let all   men be satisfied faithful & Humble and God will bless you      Heber C Kimball then arose & with uplifted hands to heaven   offered up a fervent Heart felt prayer to God imploreing his   blessing upon President Young & Councellors & all the Authorites   of the Church with the whole house of Israel He then dedicated   the ground unto God & prayed for the blessings of the Lord to   attend them in building the Temple & all the public works in   Zion     
 At the close of the prayer the presidency & Twelve walked to  the South East cornor of the ground laid out for the Temple  the ground being frozen President Heber C Kimball commenced   breaking the ground with a pick then President Richards then  Orson Hyde Parley Pratt, W Woodruff, J Taylor A. Lyman   C. C. Rich E. T. Benson L. Snow E Snow & F. D. Richards then  the ground was broke & President Young took out the first turf  while taking it out silver Dollar was flung from some one in   the congregation which strut in the hole brother Kimball said  that was an Omen that we should hav a plenty of mony   to build the temple with (Orson pratt was at Washigton &  G. A. Smith at Provo all the rest of the Twelve were present)  as soon as the turf was taken out the congregation was dismissed  & the people rushed to the hole to get a chance to throw a little  dirt out. My Father Aphek Woodruff aged 78 years, myself  Wilford Woodruff aged 46 years and My Son Wilford Woodruff Jr  aged 12 years, all flung out dirt out of the foundation for   this important Temple. After leaving the Temple ground I went   in company with the Presidency & Twele to see the New sugar  works opeprate I saw the Hydraulic press oparate in pres[ing]  out the Juice it was a splendid esstablishment Brother Joseph  Russell of Marimichi had furnished about $50000 dollars   to purchase the machinery & apperatus & get it to the valley  to make sugar from the beet. My Children Willford, Phebe  & Susan also Emma & Sarah were all present at the breaking  of the ground for the foundation of the Temple      February 15, 1853 ~ Tuesday      Feb 15 A meeting of the seventies was called in the Tabernacle  the House was filled. The meeting was opened by prayer by Z  Pulsipher. J M Grant Arsose & said this meeting is to transact  business, preach & teach the people Regulate the diffent quors  &c. The Meeting was then addressed by Z Pulsipher who spoke  well & made good remaks      Henry Harriman next followed & spoke to edifycation      Milo Andrews next followed & also Edifyed the people      Harrison Burgess next followed He also spoke well quoted  some prophesies said the Seventis were to go out under the  direction of the Twelve & build up the Kingdom of God &   regulate all the affairs of the same in all the world who  of the seventies are prepared for all this we should improve  all our time in treasuring up Knowledge & instruction  & dont spend it foolishly for we shall want all the knowledge   we kan obtain in filling our mission to the Nations of the  Earth I was baptized in 1832 & have spent more than   half of my life in the work      Adjourned till 2 oclok Met at 2 ock according to adjournment  Prayer by W. Woodruff who also addressed the congregation  the following are some of the remarks he made. I am always  interested in meeting with the saints esspecialy with so many  of the Seventies & Elder as are here to day. There never was a  school in any age of the world that presents as much of interest  to the reflecting mind as the one presenting itself to us in this age not  ownly the affairs of the church but the History of the Changes & Revelo-  tion of all Nations on Earth. the Time has come when the Earth     
 is to be redeemed from the power & dominion of the Devil  & the heavens with all the prophets that have ever lived are inluded  in the great work the Elders who are before me to day have   this great battle to fight & the victor to win I never saw   a time in any age of my life when I have had more   desire to live than at the present time I want to see the work   progress, the kingdom rise that it may become esstablisd  in all the Earth & the Effects that will follow. yes the Elders  should improve their time in treasuring up knowledge &  counsel for you will want it when you go the Nations   of the Earth dont spent your time in playing cards  dice chess or in any such foolish way but improve the  time to the best advantage & seek to conquer yourselvs  & preside over yourselvs & bring all your passions in subjection  to the law of Christ as our president has taught us One  item which I count of importance I wish to speak off  I wish to exhort the 70s & Elders to keep a Journal &   History of their lives for the record & history of this  Church & Kingdom will be wanted in a future day ther  has been no dispensation on Earth the procedings of  which will be more interesting than the one in which we  live. Should we ever have the privilege in our resurrected  bodies of visiting other planits & the inhabitants of the same we  should want to learn the history of that people if they had   kept no records of their lives, & the dealings of God with them  so we could get their History we should feel much disap-  pointed so would they should they visit us. it is true  that Joseph Smith kept a History of his own life & those  things in some measure connected with him He is now  dead but his life & Testimony is now being published to the  world in seperate peaces in our publications. Also president  Young has scribes who are recording his daily acts & life  which is right & good. but does that record the life   History & dealings of God with the many thousands  of the Apostles & Elders who are or will be in all the world  among evry Nation under Heaven No varrily No. then  all ye Elders of Israel write your History & the dealings of  God with you in all the world for your own benefit  & that of your posterity, for the benefit of the House  of Israel, for the benefit of Jew & Gentile for the benefit  of futur generations, & in fine for the benefit of those  celestial beings from other planets who may see fit to  visit us either in time or Eternity & wish to visit our  libraries & peruse the History of the inhabitants of the  Earth esspecially the saints in the last dispensation & fulness  of times then write & do not neglect it; many other  remarks were made by the speaker which are not recorded  Here      Brother Wood next made a few remaks said he  would do all the good he could would follow the counsel of the prophets  & leave his conscience in the states for he believed the people would  be led by the Holy Ghost if they followed the counsel of the prophets who  were set to lead them. He thought they were safer than his conscene  for paul once thought in all good conscience that he was doing   Gods will by persecuting the saints so his conscience decvd him     
 A. P. Rockwood next spoke & said my text is in the words   of the Apostle Wilford that we are the people chosen to build   up the Kingdom this I believe to be true many glorious   principles have been displayed in the words of Brother Woodruff   & they are worthy to be written & handed down to all generations   as it would be profitable for all to read all should write &   learn to write in short hand that we may report speeches &   sermons let us pay up our tithing & obey the authorities that   are put over us the brethren had much rather be brought   before the Authorities of the land than the Church      Meeting adjourned till 6 oclok in the evening when the people met   & about 40 were ordained to the Seventies & remarks made   from several of the brethren      February 16, 1853 ~ Wednesday      16th Meeting commenced at 10 oclok Brother Greward who had   been to the Islands on a mission preached in the forenoon gave   an account of his mission & closed up by speaking & saying the   Lords prayer in the Tahitain language. I was not present at   his discourse so I could not write it      A Lyman followed at some length said he had no Different   feelings abot the seventies than he had abot the Elders or High priest  He was no more partial to one than the other He did not know of any   ordination that was of any benefit to him aside from his own   exheriton He never boasted of any office he had He wished to live   in such a manner that I can say to all men follow me I dont   wish to be under the necessity of citing evry body to follow Brother   Young or Brother Kimball I want to be able to say to all follow me as   I follow Christ many other remarks were made by Brother Lyman      Brother Coleburn made some remarks said he was baptize by Brother  Brigham Young in 1833 was ordained an Elder by Joseph Smith      Brother Joseph Young addresed the meeting wished all might soon   be enabled to govern themelvs I am president of the Seventies   & the quorums were set in order by Joseph Smith & I suppose it   is right their is a president over each quorum of the seventies   And I want evry president to keep their quorums in order  it is the privilege & duty of evry president to try & cut off any   member of his quorum if they are worthy of it I dont want to   be to slow or two fast but as near the line as I can get. And I wish   others to do the same I wish All the seventies to take the Desarett News   & read it & let your children read it & put it in your library & preserve  it. I also want you to sharpen up your swords & keep your arm in   order & learn the art of war and I want all to do military duty  Joseph once said if we did not keep our arms in order an enemis   might come upon us as unawares & destroy us but if we are prepared we   need not fear I was at the slaghter at Hauns mill I dont want to see   any more of it. I also want the Seventies to pay up their tithing  it has now become a matter of Church fellowship & I hope you will   not forget it      E T Benson followed was rejoiced to hear what he had it had warmed   up his hart I wich to obey the Lord & fulfill my calling we have had   good counsel & we will do well to follow it we are about to begin   another Temple I epect the devil will be mad I dont care if     
 we dont stay hare a month if the Lord wants we should go away   when I look back to the days of Nauvoo & compare them with   these days A [I] am satisfyed that evry move we make is for our   good many said then we could not travel but would be destroyed   Brother Brigham said we could Journey & not a man be lost & it   has proved true we are here & in a good situation yet if ye will live   godly in Christ Jesus ye shall suffer persecution this Kingdom has   to be built up by manual labour I hope this people will soon be in   a situation to live by their own resources & not trust to the Gentiles some   dont pray but a man can no more live without praying than they can   without bread if you dont keep the commandments of God the devil   with use you for his deciple. Blessings will not stick upon an unfaith  ful man but they will upon one that is faithful. let us pray in secret   as well as in the family circle any body that dont know that   mormonism is true is not fit to send on a mission the priest of   the day say they preach from the bible I tell them they dont know that   it is true it is true but I know that mormonism is true      Erastos Snow followed & said that he was glad to hear what was   said it was good I am glad to see the seventies together you have   as much of a calling as you can fulfill dont wish for any greater   calling the day has come when this body of men will be   called into immediate action & if evry one of you could be in   20 places at once you would find enough to do it is better to   wear out than to rust out the Seventies are the bone & sinnew   of Israel the Battle Ax of the Almighty what a mighty influence   they must wield in Israel & the world we are begining to   become one as a people Joseph said he had got a lever under   the earth & he ment to turn it over that it might be right side   up the seventies I expect will do much towards turning it over  it is for our best interest to build up the Kingdom of God   & do his will      Erastus Snow followed Meeting continued through the evening   some two New quorums of seventies was organized during   the evening but I was not present & could not give particulars   but the evening closed up the meeting for business preaching &c      February 17, 1853 ~ Thursday      17th I spent the day at home writing      February 18, 1853 ~ Friday      18th I spent the day at home the west side Jordon hunting   for my horses & cows found my cows but not my horses      February 19, 1853 ~ Saturday      19 I spent the day at home choring & writing      February 20, 1853 ~ Sunday      20th Sunday Erastus ^Snow^ addressed the meeting & spoke well He said   [FIGURE] if he spoke to their edifycation it would have to be by their   prayers & faith he said he felt dull & did not feel as he did while   in the vineyard preaching he felt he said as the little boy at   sea in the storm his Father was captain of the ship & had the   helm & all were afraid of being lost the boy was asked why   he was not afraid he replyed that he had no fear for   dada had the helm & their was no danger so I fell H[◊◊]   dada has the helm here so their is no danger He spoke   of his mission in denmark the Lord showed him that   the King & counsel was taking counsel against him to     
 to stop his preaching he herd their conversation in a   night vision but he said as I kept the Law & my brethr[en]   they could find no accusation against me. He exhorted   the Saints to faithfulness & said many interesting things   He was followed by presidet Young      [FIGURE] President Brigham Young arose & said he does appreciate   the blessings we enjoy. There is no other people on earth that   enjoy as great blessings in the gospel of Jesus Christ. Some suppose   that no people but ourselves have enjoyed the light of the Lord  no other people do enjoy the fulness of the gospel but all men more   or less have had the light of the Lord as he hwas LIts light that enlight[en]ed   evry man that cometh into the world. we are now living in the   times of times the dispansation of all dispansation none have   put it down no matter how it may be disspiced it is the Kingdom   of God on the Earth hear in our midst. now ask yourselves the   question are you as happy as you expeted you would be when   you got to Zion have you got what you anticipated you would get   All the world cannot disprove this to be the Kingdom of God   Here the Saints are gathered from the states England & other parts   of the world what were your feelings while there it was if I could   ownly get to the valley with the Saints I would be satisfyed for I   cannot bear to stay in the wicked world & hear the blasphemes of the   people but I want to be with the saints, well now are you not   with the saints & are you not the saints then are you happy   whad did you anticipate why it was that there would the blesed   Saints dwell whare there would be no more sin or wickedness and   I shall bask in the smiles of my Lord well how is it now is it as   you anticipated what henders your enjoying all that you anticipated   I can answer it for myself if I dont have all the light truth Joy   & happiness & glory that I anticipated [it] is because of my vary self and   my will prevents me. All hell cannot hender me if I am right   from enjoying all that I expect. If any other man does wrong   trespasses steals my polls fence or any thing els it is no reason why  I should do wrong again, because my neighbor does an evil   It is no reason why I should do an evil in all the days of my life   & say that man that will do right in all things let his Neighbor   do as he may shall have heaven here. Who has got power to che[a]t   me out of my crown, Glory, Heaven, Kingdom, &c who is it that   has an influence over you who is it ^[◊]^ will deprive you of all that   you expect nobody but yor own selves And any body that   does not know enough about salvation to judge what to do   when you are instructed continually are not capable of   receiving a Celestial Kingdom they are not worthy of it   No one that cannot preside over themselves is not worthy of   it but it is those who are valient in the Testimony of Jesus   Christ & bring themselves in subjection to the Law of Christ  & say I will serve God let others do as they may.      Another question I will do all I can to ask the Lord for   wisdom all the day long & if I do right am i not capapble of   knowing things for myself I am. when the people first   went to Jackson Co they thought if they could ownly get   there they would be in glory nearly all seemed anxious.   to get there I did not go myself but went into the world   & preached the gospel to the people but by & by the people in     
 that place had more trouble than we did. but I now   will ask if they suffered in their feelings as much as  they would have done if they had anticipated the trouble   & known it before No, for they could not bear it the   anticipatin of trouble or happines is far beyongd the  reality in this life. Some think they could not bear the   troubles that this Church have passed throgh, but I have passd   through it & bourn it well enough & never felt better   than I have in the midst of the persecutions of the Saints  We talk of sacrafize do we sacrafize in the building   of this Kingdom If I had millions & used it in   the building of this Kingdom bwould it be sacrafize No  If I was called to go & preach the gospel all the days of   my life & never see my family again it would not   be sacrafize what is our reward for our labour & faithfu-  lness it is Thrones, Kingdoms, principalities Eternal   Lives & a seat among the Gods then is it sacrafice No   such thing I believed that all would be better to gather togethe  with the saints than to remain in the world I thought all wou-  ld be honest I laid aside all my account Books I thought I   should not need to keep any accounts with the saints but I   have found it quite different many do not fell disposed to pay   their debts if they can gag red [get rid] of it. many of the saints are   fearful. The little time that I talked on the stand to Judge Bro-  cchus their was more suffering in the flesh ^&^ in spirit in the   few minutes & for months afterwards than you would suffer   in reality in years of persecution many in their imagin-  ation saw us all hung, shot, drown murdered massacred in   evry imaginable shape that you could think off & one reaso[n]  that you suffer so much more than you expected here in   Zion is you have brought yourselves with you but at last   you will lay down self & it will go to the dust now I want   to give a text for evry body to preach from & that is   take a course to restore confidence throughout the whole   land of Zion & the whole kingdom of God let confi-  dence be restored to all men by an upright course   of life & doing right unto all & practice it commence  with your family your children. If you give your child  any thing for instence a trunk to put their things in dont   never go to that trunk or disturb those things in any wise  without the special leave of your child so by your wife any  thing that she possesses or that you give her never disturb   that or take any thing that is hers without her leave so   let the wife do by the Husband never disturb any thing  that is his without his leave so with children they  should never touch any thing that is their parents  without their leave. I never opened a trunk belong[ing]  to one of my wives in my life but once & that was to get   a portrait to send to the states as I could not wait for   her to return before the messenger left then from your   families let this principle go through your neighborhood   & throughout the whole Kingdom of God pay all men what you  owe them fulfill your promises and if your Neighbors Horse   ox cow or any thing that he has is suffering by your door feed   it & save its life as you would if it was your own     
 and then let your Neighbors woods poolls fence & evry thing he   has got alone & let all of mine alone & I will yours And in   this way you will restore confidence dont trespass upon  any body but do right & the blessings of God will attend you  Brother Richards said owe no man any thing I owe gratitude   to God & to all mankigd in a measure but in a measure   or anoth[er] sens owe no man any thing but do right in all   things & you will have all the Heaven & Zion that you can   enjoy in this world      February 21, 1853 ~ Monday      221st [FIGURE] I spent this day in Company with President Young   and had a vary plesant agreeable day with him I dined   with him in company with E. T. Benson President Young gave  me a mission to go onto the Temple Block & take Charge of   the tithing hands I agreed to do so      February 22, 1853 ~ Tuesday      22nd [FIGURE] I spent a part of the day in company with Brother   Wells & Brother Angel in learning what was required of me in   taking charge of the tithing hands Brother Angel showed me the   Temple plot or ground plan which he had drawn I assisted Brother  Coray in taking the names of the Temple Ha[n]ds at night.      February 23, 1853 ~ Wednesday      ^[FIGURE]^ Wednesday 23rd I commenced my labour this morning on   the Temple ground in diging out the earth for the foundation  I found it a busy place      February 24, 1853 ~ Thursday to February 26, 1853 ~ Saturday      24, 25, 26 I spent the time on the Temple block      February 27, 1853 ~ Sunday      [FIGURE] 27th Sunday I attended meeting President Brigham Yg   preached & he presented some of the most interesting &   deepest principles ever presented to man on the earth  I had not paper & did not write them the following are   some of the items given in speaking of the privileges of this peop[le]  He said the people should first perform evry known duty  & not neglect them to enjoy any pleasure in speaking of   danceing he said when the saints were taken up with the   spirit of the fiddle & dancing & had not the spirit of God   they were wrong & in the wrong road a man should   never go to a dan[c]e to the neglect of other Duties neith  should he unless he could have the spirit of God as well   as in a prayer meeting. He said some Elders would   threaten to curse their wives if they did not obey him   because he had the priesthood He said the curses of such men   wer of no force & the women need have no fears of it  He said again some men had a desire to stick to the   work because it made them kings & priest so they could  sway a great septer & rule with a rod of Iron & damn men  here & curse them there &sc and had not in view the  principles of Justice Jud[g]ment mercy truth &c but they cou[l]d  not arise upon such principle even God himself should  He act upon this principle He would scease to be God for   the principls that sustain him & his Throne would   forsake him & he would scease to be God for light &   truth & evry other good principle cleaves unto itself     
 And these all sustain the throne of God & He sustains them  He & all righteous men love the truth for the truth sake   & embrace it & maintain it because it is just & true   not because it gives them power to rule with a rod of  Iron Some men want women sealed to them at the   same time they will steel my property I want such   men to go to Calafornia as soon as possible for they will  go to Hell any how who should have women sealed to  them those men who have proved to God Angels & man  that they are willing to do any thing that God requires of them  at the sacrafice of all their own private interest or  feelings & have been faithful all the day long such should   have women sealed to them for they will be saved. I ha[v]e   told the brethren that all good men might have this privilge  but they must be their own Judges if men ask for this  privilege & abuse it they sell their birth right like Esau they   cannot never regain it in all Eternity men that have wom[en]  sealed to them & abuse them & turn them out doors & treat   lightly those sacred things given unto them it will prove a   curse unto them then beware O ye people how ye treat the thi[n]gs   of God that are committed unto you. for many will wake up   from an awful dream & find themselves wifeless & childless   in the morning of the resurrection who thought they had  possessions, for they will sceace to increase & when they   scease to increase they will decrease the diff[ere]n[c]e between Christ   & the devil is Christ will increase & the devil will decrese   untill Christ will have power to destroy death & him that   hath the power of death which is the devil yes the devil   will finally be destroyed & disorganized & will scease   to exhist as a devil & the Elements of which he is composed will   go back into its mother Element & the Devil will scease to be   & so will his Angels & evry thing that does not increase will   decreas untill it will be disorganzd & he expressed it as his  opinions that there were many who had a tabernacle on   Earth that would never have a resurrection many other  interesting remarks were made by the speaker      February 28, 1853 ~ Monday      28 I spent the day on the Temple block      March 1, 1853 ~ Tuesday      March 1st 1853 This is my birth day I am 46 years   of Age this day this birthday finds me having charge of   the tithing hands in commencg to prepare for the building of ano[t]h[er]  Temple to the Name of the most high God may the Lord enable us   to finish it      March 2, 1853 ~ Wednesday to March 5, 1853 ~ Saturday      2, 3, 4 & 5 I spent this week on the Temple block      March 6, 1853 ~ Sunday      6th Sunday I attended Meeting.

Prophets & Apostles & all the saints are   edefyed when they hear an Elder preach by the spirit of God  the Devil would strive to make you believe that you could  not preach & He would take all of the spirit of God from   you if he could. I will tell you what the Lord & the prophets   & Apostles want of all of the Elders & that is that you live   in such a manner that you may be filled with fire so   that you can preach or pray & be filled with the power of   God so as to Edify all. Brother Clawson says that   I am not capable of Edifying this people what does this  say that I have been in the dark Now I will give you   the key [FIGURE] so that you will know how to improve all the lessons   you have to take do right live so that you will have the   spirit of God dont do wrong in any thing dont get Angry   be slow to judge of your neighbor Now the key is to   live so close to God that He cannot hide his face from you   if you do not you will always be dull scholars all your  lives you must walk in the light of the Lord or you cannot   Edify & do good you must do it. A man that is in   his place can see all that is going on as well as I could   stand on an eminance & see all that is going on on my   farm. There is no more need of getting mad crossing  the plains or in the canyons than their is while setting   in a Rocking Chair or in this Stand if you have the   Spirit of God & keep it then you can learn what their   is to be known. you should pray go to God live in the   spirit of God untill you are full & your bones are filled   with fire.      I am fully satisfyed with what God   has given me I am always satisfyed with what I   have had. I Have had the spirit of God to lead me   while in England as Joseph had in America for we   have the same God to Assist us in one place as in anoth[er]   & this will be the case with the Elders in all the world  In speaking of the Revolutionary war said we would   not have any national feeling against our brother   or any good man      September 25, 1853 ~ Sunday to September 30, 1853 ~ Friday      25 to 30 I spent the time ploughing & sewing wheat      October 1, 1853 ~ Saturday      Oct 1st [FIGURES] I Received one letter from I F Carter &   wrote 1 Letter to J M Bernhisel
