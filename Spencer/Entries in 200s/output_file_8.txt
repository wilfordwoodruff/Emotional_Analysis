Your position is ownly following in the footsteps of the prophet Joseph in his day. I have felt for a good while that there was a change coming over Zion, over our Nation, and over Great Babylon. And this in order to fulfill the Revelations of Divine truth and to carry out the purposes of the Lord. I cannot but acknowledge the hand of the Lord in the present afflictions of the Latter Day Saints. The persecution of the Righteous by the wicked is a legacy bequeathed to all Saints in Every age of the world and will continue untill Christ reigns on the Earth. And while all the powers of the Earth are combined with the powers of Darkness and of Evil to Destroy the Latter Day Saints from off the Earth it should be a strong testimony  to sinners that the God of Heaven had set his hand to Esstablish his Church and Kingdom on the Earth   though I wanted to get out to meeting and speak to the people in thes southern settlements but there is a Commissioner and several Deputy Marshals appointed in this District and if I get into the hands of my Enemies I should not have the Liberty I now Enjoy.

His son's wife was the most handsome woman I ever saw of the Indian race; had a beautiful child, nearly white. I went through their wheat fields, which they were c eral ruins of the ancient inhabitants; some of the outside walls of stone were standing some eight feet high. On Sunday evening, the 25th, we held a meeting in a village of the Lagoonies, called Mosita Negra. We had an interesting talk with the Governor of the place (Lorenzo Coreo) and both wanted a meeting, and they called the people together, men, women and children. We opened by singing and prayer and Brother Tenney spoke to them in Spanish thirty minutes. I spoke a short time. Brother Tenney interpreted and we dismissed, thinking we had kept them long enough. As soon as we dismissed, a Nephite arose, full of the  Spirit of the Lord, and said, "Friends, why do you dismiss us and leave us in this way. This is the first time we have heard of our forefathers and the Gospel, and the things we have looked for from the traditions of our fathers.

I approve of your views in calling for volunteers to settle those places instead of forcing men to go as missionaries.

Therefore I trust this may  be a sufficient excuse for my seemingly neg- lect on my part. I must confess it gave  me peculiar feelings to return to Salt Lake  where I had spent thirty-five years and built  four dwelling houses and now I find not a  place to lay my head. I could not attend the  funeral of my wife with which I had spent  about fifty years in the marriage covenant The only privilege I had in the matter  was to look through a window at the H.

I did not know that the Suprientendants of the Improvement associa- tions had been called upon to call men in- to the missionary field. I enquired of Bro. Franklin about the matter and he said he had called upon the Presidents of two stakes to  a certain number of men as missionaries and they had not made out the number called for, and ^Bro Richards^  the names of some of the most suitable men to the President of the stake for his approval, and  that none have been called only upon the ap- proval of the President of the stake.

I think the present Generations are far from  your Remarks in the Epistle to myself and my Brethren the Apostles, of the great responsiblity which Rests upon us. And while I am shut up like a caged Lion, and cannot open my mouth in the congregations of the Saints or sinners.

But the Young Men's Associations have gathered together hundreds if not thou- sands in their meetings that have no priesthood, and today would be mingling with the wicked if they had not been gathered to the meetings of the Young Men's Associations. Then there are hundreds of the better class that have no priest- hood, and belong to no quorum, and would not attend the quorum meetings. Now I did not know that you had any objections to the conferences of the Young Men's Associations, only upon the ground that they interfered with the Sabbath schools. I did not know that Brother Cannon had any objection, only on that ground.

We spent the day in the place and left in the evening and camped five miles below on the bank of Islatus (Ysleta), being the day before the great annual feast of this people. Brother Ammon M. Tenney had visited this people three years ago and had mad patriarch that had received him before. His name was Juan Reylocero (John King). He was g mutton, fruit and anything we needed. He was one of the leading spirits and most influential men  but his labor and activity did not show 70. It should be understood that the Catholic power has had dominion for centuries over most of the American tribes. This is the case with all these tribes, as well as others, and the priests who now occupy their villages are mostly French or Italian. The priests who dwell in Islatus has had a hard contest with the old patriarch, because he had received the Mormons and their religion. He told the priest that he had his own rights and agency and no men should take his rights or religion from him, and they had not spoken to each other for two years, and this spirit is manifest through all the tribes when the Gospel is preached and the Lamanites and Nephites throughout all the land are beginning to be weary of the Catholic priests and their religion. The inhabit- ants of Islatus stand at the head of these 32,000 Nephites; all the other 40 villages come to them for counsel. They have their own laws, police courts and judgment seat.

If we do, it appears to me, it would be just as unwise as it would be to stop the meetings of the Sabbath School children. I think it would be a great injury to our young men and women. I have never known the Sunday School presidents or teachers to attempt to form a separate interest from the Church and Priesthood. Neither have I the Mutual Improve- ment Associations. The object of the Conferences of the Young people is to encourage each other, and I think they have done a great deal of good.

They came together accordingly and deliberated on the best means of engaging the attention of the Saints generally upon this subject. Each one of the Twelve had a portion of the Territory assigned to him, in which to operate.

But bretheren it is not for this purpose that I write to you It is upon the situation of this Ashley ward that I wish to write.  I do not know of a ward or stake in the whole Church that is more divided than this Ashley ward. It seems that the people want an organization of this county into a stake, which I think they aught to have.  But the great majority of the faithful Saints think there is not a man in the ward that the people will unite upon to preside over them. It appears nescessary for a man to be sent fram abroad of decis preside over this stake if it ever prospers as a branch of the Church of Later Day Saints.

It was very seldom that a case of seduction of a wife or daughter was ever known in their tribes. Whenever such a case did occur, the penalty of death was exe centuries, until civilization was introduced by Americans, who had introduced seduction and corruption wherever they had a chance, and now, if a man was put to death for seduction, the civilization of the day would kill him. In fact, they were so much afraid of white men coming  H. Smith, of the 15th Ward, Salt Lake City, three years ago, came near starving to death before they got thoroughly acquainted with them, as they were not willing for them to go into the presence of their women, but after the old patriarch had full confidence in Brother Tenney, he put his granddaughter (a very handsome young woman) in his charge, as he was going away for a season and a young Mexican wished to court her, and the old gentleman did not wish him to marry her. And, as the people in that village had full confidence in him, on our arrival we were kindly received and entertained by all we called upon. I look upon the Islatus as the most industrious and hard laboring people of any I ever met with (t not excepted).

This decision was taken upon the ground that counsel was given last year for all the Presidents of Stakes to attend the Semi Annual Conferences I reflected upon this subject, and my mind was exercised upon it and the Spirit did not dictate to me that it was wisdom for them to go, and I told them so. The same authority that gave them counsel at that time to attend, has since given them and us all counsel to keep out of the hands of our enemies; and I feel satisfied that with the exposure to which they are subject that they could not go through the country to Logan and return without getting into trouble as all the railroad trains and stations are guarded from here to Logan.

She received me and treated me with all the elegance that any refined lady could, and presided over her household with all the dignity and grace of a Martha Washington. When her daughters were introduced to me, after bowing and shaking hands, they very reservedly and modestly retired across the room, sat down upon a settee and listened to what was said in silence.

First the Mexicans had destroyed in their ignorance nearly all of the Government Survey stakes and Boundaries (thinking that if the stakes were destroyed they would not have to pay for the land). This made it quite difficult for the brethren who had taken up claims on the Mead- ows to find any lines so as to tell where to build. And on our return to Ladd to go to the brethren at the Meadows and St John and try to run out the lines. And the other difficulty is the want of men to hold the claims at the Meadows and take possession of the land we have purchased at St John.

There is hardly a family that has emigrated to Arizona this season that have brought breadstuff enought hardly to last them to Sunset. Bro Smith has had to send hundre- ds of pounds of flour back on the road to feed the people to get them as far as here; and the hundreds of the immigration are looking to Bro Lot Smith to feed them for a year to come. And Sunset is the   a bushel of grain to spare, and he has not one bushel to spare where he should have ten to feed the multitude. And althought they raised 3000 bushels of grain at Snow-Flake when we were at Conference one half of the people of that place asked him for grain or flour to furnish them for a year to come and a great share of the Mormon people of Arizona are looking to him to furnish them bread as they did last year, but he cannot do it. He has had a good crop of wheat and corn but he cannot a quarter supply the wants of the people if they did not use a bushel at Sunset. He said to me today he would have to save all his bran and shorts to grind up for bread.  And that old   down so they cannot thresh what they have got until a small pinion wheel is sent from St. Louis or Z. C. M. I., he has sent to both places for it.

And there is certainly a peculiar spirit with many of the emigrants this season, they seem to think and even say that Bro Lot Smith is under obligation to feed them and never think of paying anything for what they do get. In fact one man said that belongs to the poor camp of 60 that come to get flour, meat and molasses that his company was not going hungry as long as Lot Smith had wheat or corn.

As I arose to speak I was clothed upon with the Spirit of God and my mind was turned towards the young people, who had met us the evening before, and the following is a synopsis of some of the remarks which I made.   to address this assembly my mind leads  me to speak to the young people, who are before me this morning.

He drinks too much  too much and does not accommodate the people or att- end to his business as he should.

You have every reason, so far as we have been acquainted, to anticipate success in cotton culture; the sums offered by the Society as premiums, though small, will be sufficient to en- courage many to pay more particular attention to cotton culture, especially those who cultivate small por- tions of land, than has hitherto been done.

I have had a good deal of time to read, meditate, and pray since I have been on this mission. I have read the Bible, Book of Mormon, Doctrines &amp; Covenants since being here besides the Hystory of France &amp; England &amp; M Hystory of the World, Blair's Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres and other works. I have read a good deal more than I can remember or have digested, but I have found the Sacred books very profitable to me. I could hardly have believed that I could have been as contented as I have been on this mission. I have had nothing else to do but to try to do good, preach the gospel, strengthen the    up Zion. I have had no desire for gold, Silver property on speculation. I have had no use for money, occasionally somebody would give me 2 or 3 dollars, I would give it away the first charit- able chance I had. All my wants have been supplied. The Saints would take no money from me for anything done for me. Bro Lot Smith has supplied me with all the clothing I have wanted reward and why should not I be contented and happy under the circumstances in which I have been placed. Among other blessings I have had a good Sister M ate as my scribe or copyist and I think there is great necessity for this for I think sometimes I have mur- dered more paper than any man living on earth of my age.

Bro Smith sent money to buy the best threshing machine in market, sent to R Burton &amp; E. F. Sheets to help pick it out, it was put into Hiram Clawsons hands and he sent an old Whitmans threshing machine that he had had on hand a long time and could not sell to any body else, and it was freighted down here to Sunset 700 miles and as soon as it was opened it would have been taken back if it had not been more than 300 miles. it has been a curse to them ever since it was brought here, in spite of all they can do it wastes grain and only can thresh   ENDENTRY  attention, and all three of these settlements have to depend on it to thresh their wheat. it is now brok- en down so that it cannot be be used at all until a pinion wheel is sent from St. Louis or Z.C.M.I. Bro Smith has sent to both places for me. He sent for a bill of goods to the Co-op. when it came to Sunset it all came in one box Indigo, Alum, Logwood Madder, slates, pencils, school books &amp;c, all mixed ^together^ in one compound. There has been something wrong with almost every piece of machinery sent for, last spring they sent to Z. C.M.I. for a two horse large sized Molasses cane mill. It was put into the hands of H Clawson who sent a small one horse mill with some parts missing when it arrived. It was entirely too small for their use and last of all though not least they wanted to start a tannery had their vats in place and tanner and materials all on hand, they wanted a bark mill and sent money by Bro Flake and when he arrived    the Beaver Co-op. who is dealing with the Z C.M.I. to send for a bark mill for the Sunset Tannery, Bro Smith had to send on extra team to the ferry to bring it but when it arrived behold! and Lo! it turned out to be a little giant, a corn-cob mill and not suitable for grinding bark at all, now all has to wait until a ba Louis, brought to the terminns by rail and then freighted from there by way of Albuquer- que. Now is not this enough to try the patience of Saints,? to say nothing about sinners, I think it is. I think that persons living as far from Salt Lake as these settlements are who wish to patronize their own Institutions and pay down should have a little care and pains taken for them and not make such blunders as have been made towards them.

I have been alone a great deal since I have been a married man, and for the last two years I have not been with any of my family but very little, with the exception of riding with Ashley, and since I last wrote you I have been having some very poor turns of what is called Bright's disease, or kidney disease, the worst I have every had. In one instance I became almost blind, speechless, and had loss of memory for half an hour. My senses then all returned. I was very weary at the time, having travelled about 40 miles that day. Notwithstanding this, my vital health is good. I have lost considerable flesh this season. I thought I had better have one of my wives spend the winter with me and nurse me. I have travelled 1000 miles since the first of June in lumber wagons, though I had a spring seat the last 350 miles. I am in Salt Lake County.
