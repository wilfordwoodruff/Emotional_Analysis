I feel that I can say Amen with Every sentiment of my heart, to every principle contained in Either of them. It certainly would have been a satisfaction to me, and I presume It would have been to you to have attended the conference at Logan, but Wisdom Dictated otherwise, and we have to be satisfied. Your position is ownly following in the footsteps of the prophet Joseph in his day. I have felt for a good while that there was a change coming over Zion, over our Nation, and over Great Babylon. And this in order to fulfill the Revelations of Divine truth and to carry out the purposes of the Lord. I cannot but acknowledge the hand of the Lord in the present afflictions of the Latter Day Saints. The persecution of the Righteous by the wicked is a legacy bequeathed to all Saints in Every age of the world and will continue untill Christ reigns on the Earth. And while all the powers of the Earth are combined with the powers of Darkness and of Evil to Destroy the Latter Day Saints from off the Earth it should be a strong testimony to not ownly the Saints but to sinners that the God of Heaven had set his hand to Esstablish his Church and Kingdom on the Earth  in righteousness. I have felt at times as though I wanted to get out to meeting and speak to the people in thes southern settlements but there is a Commissioner and several Deputy Marshals appointed in this District and if I get into the hands of my Enemies I should not have the Liberty I now Enjoy. I lost my friend William Squire with whom I have spent most of my time for 7 months. He was sick 10 days. I Blessed him a short time before He died and bid him good by He was a true and faithful Latter Day Saint and a good friend to me, and gave me a good home.

Brother Snow left this morning, expects to hold meetings in the settlements, as he travels, and will go to Richfield and attend to the ordain- ing and setting apart of a President and counsel, according to your instructions.

I went all through the village and, for the first time in my life, I had a view of the white Indians called Albinos. Their hair, face and limbs were nearly as white as milk, much whiter than any Americans. I met with many who had been baptized and they were very glad to see me. They had 2000 acres of corn, looking well without irrigation. XOn the day following, we visited their bvillage at their farm clalled Fish Springs. I was here introduced to Brother Juan Boulista (John Bap- tist), the first man baptized in the Zunie nation by A. M. Tenney. His son's wife was the most handsome woman I ever saw of the Indian race; had a beautiful child, nearly white. I went through their wheat fields, which they were ciutting with sickles. We visited sev- eral ruins of the ancient inhabitants; some of the outside walls of stone were standing some eight feet high. On Sunday evening, the 25th, we held a meeting in a village of the Lagoonies, called Mosita Negra. We had an interesting talk with the Governor of the place (Lorenzo Coreo) and both wanted a meeting, and they called the people together, men, women and children. We opened by singing and prayer and Brother Tenney spoke to them in Spanish thirty minutes. I spoke a short time. Brother Tenney interpreted and we dismissed, thinking we had kept them long enough. As soon as we dismissed, a Nephite arose, full of the  Spirit of the Lord, and said, "Friends, why do you dismiss us and leave us in this way. This is the first time we have heard of our forefathers and the Gospel, and the things we have looked for from the traditions of our fathers.

Brother Thatcher has sent me his correspondence with you upon the subject of the Young Men's Mutual Improvement Associations. I have read his letter and your answer, also his reply to the same, and I have tried to carefully study them all, and I must say there are some things in yours and Brother Cannon's letter that I am surprised at, and as the Superintendent of the Young Men's Institutions, I feel it my duty to reply to it.  In the first place, permit me to say that while I view all earth and hell, including our own government, in  every department, with priests, editors, wicked men, and devils all combined to crush us, as the Church and kingdom of God on earth, with all our institutions, as far as they have the power; while I view this at our doors, and know that nothing can save us but the power of God, I feel that the Twelve Apostles should have the most implicit confidence in the First Presidency of the Church, and ENDENTRY sideways text President W.

Eldredges house I thought they might do something in aiding the matter, and the Twelve who are free are immediately going to visite the different stakes for the purpose of carrying out your instructions. I approve of your views in calling for volunteers to settle those places instead of forcing men to go as missionaries. What success they will have in this matter time must determine, but I think the winter is a very bad time to travel over that route.

It is on file at the H.

Therefore I trust this may  be a sufficient excuse for my seemingly neg- lect on my part. I must confess it gave  me peculiar feelings to return to Salt Lake  where I had spent thirty-five years and built  four dwelling houses and now I find not a  place to lay my head. I could not attend the  funeral of my wife with which I had spent  about fifty years in the marriage covenant The only privilege I had in the matter  was to look through a window at the H. O.  and see the prosession pass and view the  hearse that carried the mortal tabernacle  I will say I have had several copies of the letter written and sent to M Thatcher, and have been read to the Bretheren here and will endeavor to do all I can in having the counsel carried out. I did not know that the Suprientendants of the Improvement associa- tions had been called upon to call men in- to the missionary field. I enquired of Bro. Franklin about the matter and he said he had called upon the Presidents of two stakes to supply call a certain number of men as missionaries and they had not made out the number called for, and ^Bro Richards^ he asked two suprientendants to present the names of some of the most suitable men to the President of the stake for his approval, and  that none have been called only upon the ap- proval of the President of the stake. I am very good health and spirits at the present time and am using the best wisdom I posess to take care of myself. I do not move at any point only in the night.  The funeral of my wife was watched and inquiries have made by marshalls if I was in the City.

In fact I have  of late had a very strong Missionary spirit  Resting upon me esspecially to go to the Laman- ites for I feel that the Lord is at work with  them, and It seems as though I had providen- tially fallen in company with ^a great many of^ the Navajoe—  Moque and Apache Chiefs and I have felt  inspired to preach to them. And as I now  have an oppertunity of visiting the Zunis  and Istatus tribes with good Interpetors  I feel that I cannot spend my time to  any better Advantage. Brother Tenney  is at Savoia will come to Round Valley for me. We have a few men that have the name  of Mormon, who came to Arizona ^without^ witht Recommends and dont want any, did not  come to serve God or build up Zion, but  to serve themselfves, they would have been  better to have staid at home some of them  have gone back and it would be well if  others would go but they are not many  the people as a general thing are trying to  live their Religion I think Broth Jesse  N.

I have been somewhat surprized at the tardiness of some of our people in Registering, when the liberties of the people depend so much upon them. But I hope enough will register to keep the political control.  I feel that we have much reason to thank the Lord for the manner He has over-ruled the Edmunds-Tucker Bill, in its final passage, which has taken the power out of the hands of our enemies to rob us of office and property according to its original intent.  I am pleased to learn that Bros John W.

They are filled with madness, and Act more like Demons than wise men to Judge the people by Law and Equity.

He said He could not Deny his word. If the people would Repent of their sins He would stay his hand in Judgment but not without. I think the present Generations are far from itRepentance. I feel the force of your Remarks in the Epistle to myself and my Brethren the Apostles, of the great responsiblity which Rests upon us. And while I am shut up like a caged Lion, and cannot open my mouth in the congregations of the Saints or sinners. I am strongly Reminded of the word of the Lord to the Elders of Israel on the  11 Sept 1836 when He says "If you believe me you will labor while it is called to day" Again we are told that soon night will come when No man can work. When I look around myself and ask where are the ph prophets and Apostles who laid the foundation of this Church and Kingdom on the Earth, with whom I was associated in Nauvoo. They are gone, gone into the spirit world, where I shall soon follow, and there are but few left of thos days others have taken their places, but it matters not if we have done our duty. But I fear that many times as Elders of Israel, We do not Realize the great responsibility which Rests upon us while we hold in our hands in a measure the destiny of the souls of men in the generation in which we live Jesus has told us it is our privilege to know the signs of the coming of the Son of Man It does appear to me that the signs of both Heaven and Earth indicate his coming.

But I feel it my duty as Superintendent of the institutions, to express my views on the subject, for if there is any thing wrong con- nected with this matter, I feel that the responsibility, in a measure, rests on my shoulders.  President Taylor, I will confess I was startled at the idea that you had discovered that the institution was forming a separate body from the Church and holy priesthood, and was belittling the priesthood, or that it was not an institution organized by the priesthood; for I have always understood from the history of the institution that it was organized and directed in the beginning from ENDENTRY with the exception of a slight cold.

I arrived in time  to see her while alive. I spent one day and  night with her. The evening before I met  with you I felt impressed to call upon her  and did so with Brother Beulah  present. I anointed her for her buriel.  Pheobe seemed to marvel at what I was  doing, not realising that she was so near  her end, after anointing her I laid my hands  upon her and blessed her and bid her  good bye, and sent my love to my friends in  the spirit world: aAnd left her for the last  time. She died at two o'clock about eight hrs.  after. I did not see her after she was dead  I prayed to the Lord in the begining to  sustain me through what I saw and was com- ing to pass which he did do in a wonderful  manner. I could not have believed I could  have lived and passed through such a  scene with the same composure, calmness, and serenity and reconciliation of mind as I did  through her death and burial, and not shed  a tear for while my wives and children were  bowed down with sorrow, I had to hold them  up through this trying ordeal. This in connec- tion with my first meeting with eleven of the  Apostles. aAfter greeting each other we entered  into the labor of the examination and trial  of Albert Carrington which lasted from seven  o'clock till four in the morning, all of which  had a tendancy to depress the spirits of  almost any man without being supported  by the power of God. I will close this part of  my subject by saying that I felt perfectly recon- ciled to the departure of my wife. cConsidering  her bodily condition I believe it far better for  her to go to rest than to remain any lon- ger amidst the troublesome times.  I felt sorry to learn last evening of the  arrest of Bro Lorenzo Snow. It looks to me that  he was imprudent in spending so much  time with his wife Minnie in that Brick  house, when any anall acquianted with his cus- tom knew that he had made that place almost  exclusively his home. It is true that I and  others of my brethren may fall into the hands  of our enemies not withstanding the precautions  we may take. I don't wish to cast any reflections  on upon any one in these matters.  Now concerning this subject of calling of  missionaries of which you speak.

I taught the things of the kingdom of God and found hearts capable of receiving it. All were deeply interest- ed and the seeds we had sown in the hearts of that people will bring forth fruit. At the close of the meeting, the man who spoke in the  meeting came to me and said, "WHhen you return, drive to my home and all your wants will be supplied, (which we did do and held another meeting on the Sunday following, and should have baptized him and the Governor and many others, I think, if the Governor who had followed us as did the Islatus and had not returned and the people did not wish to take any steps until their Governor was with them.) On the following morning, my carriage was surrounded by the Governor and people that we had talked to the night before and some of them took breakfast with us and I had to talk to them on the principles of the Gospel and their record and signs of the times, until I left, and the leading men of the village foollowed us sixty miles to Islatus and stopped with us most of the time we were there. On the morning of the 26th of August, we drove through Rio Del Norte, which we found very low and en- tered Albequirke, containing about 3000 thousand inhabitants, Jews, Gentiles, Americans and Mexicans.

The Zion, Church, and Kingdom of God will come off triumphant in the End but how much suffering and tribulaton the Lord will permit to come upon the Saints is not for me to say I think I Realize that ENDENTRY the highest authority in the Church, and has been encouraged by the Apostleship from time to time, including President Cannon has heard me express myself in plainness before large congregations of young people, that there could be no organization in the Church, which could have a  separate interest from the kingdom of God and from the Holy priesthood. I said the Primary, sabbath school, Improvement Associations, Relief society, or any quorum of the priesthood, could have no separate interests, or organizaton, or independence outside of the Holy priesthood and governing authority of the Church and Kingdom of God. These were my sentiments then, are now, and will be to my grave. I will say that I have never taught, have never heard any other person teach, in the Young Men's Improvement Association, any word that would have a tendency to draw them away from the Priesthood, or make them  independent of it, or belittle the Priesthood. The very fact that three Apostles preside over it, and that the Stake Superin- tendents are High Priests, and many of the other officers and members possess the Priesthood, would entirely forbid such a thing.

I have written to Brother Tenney upon the subject of the Mission I travelled with Brother Tenney in 1879, in visiting several tribes of Indians including the Zunies, Lagoonies and Islata  I consider him Well qualified to Lead a Mission amo^n^g the Lamanites who understand the spanish Language. He can preach about as well in that as in the English, He seemed to have the spirit of the Mission while I was  with him. I told him if He would commence his mission with the Maricopas, Pemas, and Papagoes, who are near the Yaquis, that it would be Well, as several of ther Chiefs who visited you in Salt Lake have been baptized and many of ther Members. We have a school Esstab- lished with the Maricopas. These tribes named are an agricultural people they Raise a great deal of wheat, I do not think Brother Tenny could find a better field.  He says his imprisionment has left him in poor circumst- ances financially. I Also informed him that you would not object to granting his request upon the other subject.

I came down to the Temple last Evening to attend to the Marriage of Erastus, as his Father was not at home to attend to it, he requested me to, which I did this morning. I had a plesant interview yesterday with E. F. Sheets who are here on Church business I also had an interview with Elder Roberts who done most of the preaching at the conference, and people were much Edified I also had an interview with Jacob Hamblin. I gave him a mission to the Lamanites as he is not allowed to stay at home and his mission has been to the Lamanites for many years and he seems better qualified for that mission than to the gentiles. There was a Telegram sent here from Beaver saying that somebody had told Marshal Armstrong (A cock and bull story) that I with Thurber Spencer Bagly and others had threatened to throw Armstrong and his papers into Fish Lake if He came there to Arest any body. there was No such threats made, nor truth in it. But there was a man in Beaver (said to be a Reporter) took it up, and has tryed to make some black mailing out of it. But president Murdock has been communicated with to ^see^ Armstrong, and correct the matter with him, for we have all of us but the best of feelings with him as A Govern- met Officer, for he has behaved more Gentlemanly than any other one in the service. I think it will be setled without Difficulty but this caused me to leave the Room I have occupied of late, and I went back to my old retreat whare I had spent several months. And I found my old friend vary sick, and next morning  clensed and purified.

But the Young Men's Associations have gathered together hundreds if not thou- sands in their meetings that have no priesthood, and today would be mingling with the wicked if they had not been gathered to the meetings of the Young Men's Associations. Then there are hundreds of the better class that have no priest- hood, and belong to no quorum, and would not attend the quorum meetings. Now I did not know that you had any objections to the conferences of the Young Men's Associations, only upon the ground that they interfered with the Sabbath schools. I did not know that Brother Cannon had any objection, only on that ground. Now the Sabbath Schools hold their unions once a month, and they are of vast interest, and among the most interesting meetings in the mountains, and have a great influence for good among the rising gene- ration.

Beaver has taken the advantage of his situation and Jumped his mine; And Farnsworth told one of the Brethren that He intended to get Croff before the Grand Jury and they would place him where He could not defend him- self before the Court, as the Marshals have offered $100 for Croff. And as Croff could not go to Court the case was tried before the High Council in Beaver and when it was investigated it was clearly proven that Croff had fulfilled all the Law Required. But president Murdock Decided in favor of his Son in Law Philo Farnsworth. On the ground that Br Croff was not a Bonded Officer. He said if Croff had given bonds as the Recorder of the Mining District He would have decided in his favor, so He took the Mine away from Croff and gave it to Farnsworth. I look upon it as a vary poor Excuse for Rendering such a Decision. 5 of the 12 Counsellors voted against his Decision I Read a  copy of the Records of the decision. In my mind the cause of Farnsworth towards Croff borders upon a Criminal Action in laying a plan to get Croff into the hands of the Marshal so he could steal his mine, and deprive Croff of the power to defend himself. He could not have  defended himself before the High Council in Beaver without Being Arested, his Brother done the best He could He wanted to Appeal the case to the first presidency, But He has to leave the County in the case of poligamy.

We spent the day in the place and left in the evening and camped five miles below on the banks of the river. On the 27th of August, we entered the village of Islatus (Ysleta), being the day before the great annual feast of this people. Brother Ammon M. Tenney had visited this people three years ago and had madde friends in the place. We called upon an iold patriarch that had received him before. His name was Juan Reylocero (John King). He was golad to receive us. He furnished us with mutton, fruit and anything we needed. He was one of the leading spirits and most influential men ofin the village over 80 years of age, but his labor and activity did not show 70. It should be understood that the Catholic power has had dominion for centuries over most of the American tribes. This is the case with all these tribes, as well as others, and the priests who now occupy their villages are mostly French or Italian. The priests who dwell in Islatus has had a hard contest with the old patriarch, because he had received the Mormons and their religion. He told the priest that he had his own rights and agency and no men should take his rights or religion from him, and they had not spoken to each other for two years, and this spirit is manifest through all the tribes when the Gospel is preached and the Lamanites and Nephites throughout all the land are beginning to be weary of the Catholic priests and their religion. The inhabit- ants of Islatus stand at the head of these 32,000 Nephites; all the other 40 villages come to them for counsel. They have their own laws, police courts and judgment seat. They are very rich. The man we stopped with possessed 9000 sheep, 100 brood mares and horses, 100 mules and asses, 500 cows and oxen, a ranch worth $8000.00, and ENDENTRY and a suicidal policy for us to require it.  Now, brethren, my thoughts have run in this chan- nel. You have 50,000 Sunday School children in Utah. Now are these 50,000 children going to remain children? No. They are going to become young men and women, and I ask myself, is it a wise policy for us to fetter them and deprive them of remaining in the improvement Associa- tions, where they can advance? If we do, it appears to me, it would be just as unwise as it would be to stop the meetings of the Sabbath School children. I think it would be a great injury to our young men and women. I have never known the Sunday School presidents or teachers to attempt to form a separate interest from the Church and Priesthood. Neither have I the Mutual Improve- ment Associations. The object of the Conferences of the Young people is to encourage each other, and I think they have done a great deal of good. I will confess that my circumstances have not been such that I could attend or meet with as many of these conferences of the Mutual Improvement Associations as I could wish.

In consequence of his sickness I have Returned back to the Room I left whare I am now stoping (Except today in the Temple) The most Exciting News we had was the Dispatcher saying that Bishop John Sharp had taken the same course that Arnold had. It was a shock the people had not looked for, I should have looked for it in Many other Men before him. I would rather have been shot Dead and let my body Rest in the Tomb and my spirit Enter the spirit world free, so I could look the Lord in the face and the Prophets and Apostles with a clean conscience instead of meeting that terrible Hell that such men will have to face. Of course the ring and Tribune will now glory in such a Victory, but his joy will not be great, but his sorrow will. For a man with the knowledge and opportunity that John Sharp has, for him to agree to desert his family to carry out the Dictation of such courts as now reign and break the Covnents He has made with his family, his friends and his God He will meet sorrow such as he does not now comprehend. I would rather be struck with Lighting, And I would Rather Evry son I have on Earth would be struck Dead than to persue such a course for imprisionmet and Death are light compared with that Hell sons of perdition have to meet. whare is the man in Heaven or on Earth who dare meet that Doom. No man Dare do it who has Enough of the spirit of God, and Inspiration to see the future. I pray the Lord with all my imperfections that I may never be left to meet that fate. Let me meet imprisonment or Death  as the Lord will, but keep me from betraying my covenents, my friends, my family and my God.  My spirit is stired when I think when I think of these things If John Sharp Ever has the privilege in the spirit world of meeting with Brigham The Twelve and his many friends what will be his feeling, sorrow and Affliction. Well let us drop that curtain. Under these circ- umstances we hardly know what to look for in Men untill they are tried. Clawson and a large class of leading men must follow suit in trial. but I pray the Lord they may Not in Apostizing from ther religion. There inare many things I believe and a few things I know. I am confident A vary great Majority of the Men who have Entered into the New and Everlasting Covenant of Marriage will be true and faithful unto imprisonment and Death if necssary Take the presidency of the Church, the Twelve Apostles and thousands of Staunch men in these Mountains who have obeyed the Celestial Law of God, whoever looks for them to Apostatize, and flinch in the Hour of trial, and Deny ther God and their Religion will be disappointed. For They are Men Raised up by the power of God And the Father has given them to the Son, and they are ordained to build up the Kingdom of God in the Last days, And the Lord will stand by them, And they will Never fall This is one of the things I Know. where Men persue that course that Arnold, Spencer, and Sharp have Done, There is sumthing the matter. They have stoped praying. Thy have lost the spirit of God. There Eyes are closed to the future. For no man with the Holy priesthood and the light of Christ within him, would take such a step. It does appear to me the haste our Nation is making to get ripe, that the day is at hand when the Lord will come out of his hiding place, and give this Nation and its officers sumthing Els to do besides Hurting and Imprisionig the Elders of Israil, for obeying the Commandments of God.

Each one of the Twelve had a portion of the Territory assigned to him, in which to operate.

But bretheren it is not for this purpose that I write to you It is upon the situation of this Ashley ward that I wish to write.  I do not know of a ward or stake in the whole Church that is more divided than this Ashley ward. It seems that the people want an organization of this county into a stake, which I think they aught to have.  But the great majority of the faithful Saints think there is not a man in the ward that the people will unite upon to preside over them. It appears nescessary for a man to be sent fram abroad of decission and firmness to preside over this stake if it ever prospers as a branch of the Church of Later Day Saints.  It is reported that Abram Hatch the President af the Stake wants his brother Jeremiah now bishop to be ENDENTRY $25,000 of other wealth, real estate, lends many houses in the city, and this is an ensample of many of the Islatus nation. They allow no white man or Mexiacan to mix with them in the blood; all their marriages are in their own tribe. Our friend (Reylocero) said the Americans had called them wild men. If they were wild, they were honest and virtuous. It was very seldom that a case of seduction of a wife or daughter was ever known in their tribes. Whenever such a case did occur, the penalty of death was exedcuted and had been for centuries, until civilization was introduced by Americans, who had introduced seduction and corruption wherever they had a chance, and now, if a man was put to death for seduction, the civilization of the day would kill him. In fact, they were so much afraid of white men coming kin contact with their women, that Brothers Robert H. Smith, of the 15th Ward, Salt Lake City, three years ago, came near starving to death before they got thoroughly acquainted with them, as they were not willing for them to go into the presence of their women, but after the old patriarch had full confidence in Brother Tenney, he put his granddaughter (a very handsome young woman) in his charge, as he was going away for a season and a young Mexican wished to court her, and the old gentleman did not wish him to marry her. And, as the people in that village had full confidence in him, on our arrival we were kindly received and entertained by all we called upon. I look upon the Islatus as the most industrious and hard laboring people of any I ever met with (tehe Latter-day Saints not excepted). This Nephite village has a field of corn ten miles in length and one in width, laying north and south fof their village, all irrigated, and the corn quite as good as any I ever saw in Utah, and perfectly clean; not a weed could be found in a hundred axcres. ENDENTRY by the Lord and his Holy Priesthood, and I shall certainly not do it; for both earth and hell are full of that spirit already, without any help from me, and I certainly do not feel disposed to aid them in the matter.

Presidents, bishops, and people seemed to engage in the undertaking with an earnest, zealous purpose, until another letter from the Presidency was received, which expressed a desire that the subject should not be urged upon the brethren as a missionary duty, but be presented as a vol- unteer service. This also was attended to with great caution, and the call was repeated in person and by letter to each of the presidents of the Stakes, and seve- ral of the priesthood meetings were attended, in all of which the views of the First Presidency were most carefully communicated.  From that time it seemed as if the call lost its hold upon the minds of the people as a duty or obligation.

In the  spring it is covered and the earth leveled. This is an immense work. They have also many apple, pear and peach orchards, all ripe as well as the grapes. Islatus is only occupied by the Nephites themselves. No Mexicans or white men. The houses generally are made of adobie, dcement or concrete, and plastered, the outside walls as white as snow, and the floors made of mortar or plaster, very smooth and many of them very neatly carpeted, and we saw some as handsome women and girls as could be found in America, with the ex- ception of color. There is one practice that exceeds any civilized city on the bglobe that I ever heard of; there is no man, woman or child allowed to sweep a particle of dirt or dust from their floors into the door yards or streets, under the penalty of a fine. It all has to be gathered in cloths or baskets and carried to mounds which are located in different parts of the city. The room we occupied was in the center of the town and the mound formed from the sweepings of the floors in that part of the town measured 150 yards at the base and some thirty feet high, which had probably been 100 years in col- lecting, for they did not appear to cart it waway.

Our Nation is determined to get ripe in thir iniquity Their never was a Nation ripening faster and they must fulfill ther Destiny. The same wave that Engulphed the Jaredites and Nephites will over- whelm this Nation or one Like it. They will make war upon the Saints untill their Cup is full. Again Zion has got to be cleansed The Saints have got to be purified and united, and my opinion is we shall be affflicted untill it is done. It is not for me to say how long it will take. It has seemed to me of Late that there was a wave of Evil passing over th whole Church and Kingdom of God like a wave of the sea to temp men to do Evil.  Men that have been strong for years give way to Adultey and pollution, and sacrifice salvation to gratify the Lord of the flish, while these things remains Zion will be afflicted untill she is purified I have been pained to hear the reports of Events passing among us. But Zion will mo be moved  2  out of her place. God has Decreed it. He will ^contend with Zion and^ plead with her strong ones untill she is purifed and overcomes and clean before the Lord.  The Zion Church, and Kingdom of God must stand, prevail, conquer and overcome while the wicked must be destroyed, and Babylon fall.

Moreover, a report got into circulation that while President Hammond was calling for voters to colonize San Juan County and hold the county offices in the hands of the people, he had settled out- side the county and indeed outside the Territory,  having located at Colorado, some eighty miles from Bluff City, if I recollect aright. Whether this be true or not, it is having a dama- ging effect, and it strengthens the purpose of those who have concluded to take their own choice and stay at home. So that we only know of five persons who have reported themselves ready to go to San Juan settlement. They are from Sevier Stake, ENDENTRY 5 to the offices of the last election, and Bro. Davis told me to day that this F M Lyman John Henry Smith both promised him that if he would be baptizsed they would make him president of this Stake. I have more confidence in these two men than to believe any sutch report he is an enemy to this people, and I believe would sell us all far a few dollars a piece. The same Johnson has married Bro. Davise's Daughter which I suppose is one cause of his being in favor of him I have received reports from both parties, and I can see that the division is universahl and growing continualy wider and more bitter. Every bishop in the ward feels that bishop Hatch and councillor Davi's course in electing an outsider and a bitter enemy is entirely wrong as I do myself. I told Bro. Davis I thought very strange that he and bishop Hatch should have united with the outside element to elect a man outside of the church and of his character for a selectman. It is said there is a petition in circulation to the Presidency of the Church to have bishop Hatch elected President of this Stake. But I do not think that he is a man ENDENTRY untill 8 oclk.

The same authority that gave them counsel at that time to attend, has since given them and us all counsel to keep out of the hands of our enemies; and I feel satisfied that with the exposure to which they are subject that they could not go through the country to Logan and return without getting into trouble as all the railroad trains and stations are guarded from here to Logan.

Commencing, as our work does, with the death of President B. Young, in August, 1877, the devolvement of the Presidency of the Church upon the Twelve Apostles, with President John Taylor as the President of that Council, is the important fact that presents itself almost at the very outset of our work.

This Johnson is a brother to wife shot a man in Bearlake. I do not think him a friend to the Saints of God.

Of cours I am ^not^ in a situation to attend their conferences or teach in public, but I am satisfied with what I have learned from the various parties that there will never be any union or prosperity with this people, until there ^is^ some man sent from abroad with firmness and decision of character who will act upon the principle of rightousness in presiding over this Stake of Zion.

She was neatly dressed. I was introduced to her by Brother Tenney and her daughters and sons. She received me and treated me with all the elegance that any refined lady could, and presided over her household with all the dignity and grace of a Martha Washington. When her daughters were introduced to me, after bowing and shaking hands, they very reservedly and modestly retired across the room, sat down upon a settee and listened to what was said in silence. The matron sat down beside me and con- versed with great fereedom. While the family could speak good Span- ish, her son, a fine young man of 20, could speak good English, which was a God send to me, and I thoroughly improved it by preaching the Gospel of Christ and blessings of the kingdom of God to him, which he gladly received and promised to deliver the same to his father and mother. The matron invited us into her pear, peach and apple or- chard and grape vineyard which were ripe, and we feasted to our sat- isfaction, and we repeated by invitation the same ceremony each day while in Islatus.

("On the evening of the 14th I received your letter, and according to your request, I started for St. John in pursuit of the object this morn- ing about 9 o'clock.

We made our fire, got our breakfast and took our carriage and drove 40 miles to Sunset, over a rough rocky country a part of the way. We arrived about 7 o'clock. I counselled with Lot Smith, and yesterday I wrote a letter to Ammon M. Tenney to go immediately and close this bargain, and secure the 2 1/2 acres if possible. Buy out the whole place if possible; so that the Jews or Gentiles should not have a hold among them.

In the "M.

If it was me directing as you are I would not let day-light nor dark make any difference and while I speak of this, I will say that if there is any Mormons that could be spared  it would be well to send them immediately here to take possession; as nine points in the Law is to have peacable possession, for I tell you before-hand, that when this purchase is known it will make one of the greatest excitements that ever was here, as it will break up merchants and at least 100 families, who have built, and are depending upon rent- ing from the Barths Brothers.  My well in the new Meadow is 65 feet deep to water, which is inexhaustable.

St John purchase andc Dec 26 1879  Sunset Apache Co Dec 12th 1879  Prest. John Taylor  Dear Brother,  I write to say a messenger has just arrived from Colorado Meadows with a letter from Bro Tenney informing me that we have secured the purchase of all of St Johns except one water claim and 2 1/2 acres of land. Our purchase secures to us 3 water ditches all the land both sides of the river, and the town inc- luding the toll bridge. We got this purchase for 700 Cows to be paid in one year, from two to six years old. We have also taken possession of the Colorado Meadows, I think some 25 or 30 claims entered and we are the first on record to secure the water of the Little Colorado to water 4480 acres of the land of this Meadow. We were none too soon in securing this meadow for our claims to the water and the possession of the land had only just been obtained before the Mexicans came to enter the water and secure and take possession, and they were very much astonished to find  and have the Bishop at Johnson get some teams to go to Upper Kanab and get the lumber that is sawed for that boat and have it carried to the ferry or have the boat made in the Settlements and carried down on wheels. It seems to be absolutely necessary that something should be done. I cannot do anything about it while I am here, and again they want me to go to St Johns and the Meadows to assist about the settling of the country there.  I remain your Brother in the gospel  A. H.

So I wish you would instruct Bros Rockwood and Vancott to see that these companies are well supplied with surplus cows—enough to pay for the purchase of St. John.

First the Mexicans had destroyed in their ignorance nearly all of the Government Survey stakes and Boundaries (thinking that if the stakes were destroyed they would not have to pay for the land). This made it quite difficult for the brethren who had taken up claims on the Mead- ows to find any lines so as to tell where to build. And on our return to Ladd to go to the brethren at the Meadows and St John and try to run out the lines.

Br Tenney bought it last season. Most of the water and land engaged it for $8000 dollars but He had no backing at the time none to help pay for it and He gave it up It should be bought by some one before a company goes there or that they know a company is intending to buy it, for in the case thy understood that, they would want to Double the price Br Tenney being well acquainted with the parties is the Most suitable man in my judgement to make ENDENTRY other Labor for president Youngs family I felt it my Duty to name this and  I do not think it just to acknowledge  his claims I think one half of his charges should be taken from his Account during the past year and then we would pay vary Dear for the work done.

I appoi- nted Bro. Tenney in delivering out the land to the emigration as they come. I also appointed or recommended Bro. Allred to take charge of the meetings until the place gets settled so that it can be more fully organized. Of course all that country comes under Bro Jesse N. Smiths jurisdiction in his stake. I think Bro Toquerville will take up his farm there but will have to get a Ranche out side for his large amount of stock as will all men with large herds, as it is not suitable for large herds to dwell in any settlement of this country, for there is good facil- ities throughout the country outside of farming district We cannot tell what amount of land there is in the purhcase at St John, it may amount to 2000 acres it may vary from $5, 6 to 7 an acre besides the Government title it may not go above $5.  One Mexican Brother joins us on our lower line which he throws into the company and takes his share of land and water with the rest. We also bought out two Mex- ican claims joining our Mexican Brothers claim down the river with two houses, 320 acres of land for 9 cows, so we have an unbroken claim from the Dam down the river on both sides nearly to the Meadows with the exception of two Mexican claims below us and when we left one or both of theirm were talking of being baptized, but there is one thing I wish to name concerning our purchase. I supposed it included the houses of the Mexicans. I now understand it includes the land they stand on but the Mexicans claim the houses. The Jews permitted them to build on the land and they now claim them, but they are poor, low, one story mud houses mostly. We have several of the houses standing on the farming land The two brother missionaries from Ogden occupy two of them with their famiflies.

He seems to think the Courts and Marshals here got so far along without the Church records that they find they do not need them. That there is no necessity of proving any marriage, as they seem to have adopted Judge Howards views, that it requires very little Law and Damn little testimony to convict a mormon. I thought if the presidency had any views to communicate to me about coming to S. L. C. I should be pleased to receive them. Brother Snow will start in few days for S.

McLellan Superintendant of a Saw Mill owned by persons residing in Brigham City said Territory. Mr Harris states that the timber taken was hauled about 45 miles and used for domestic purposes by the settlers along the Little Colorado River in the vicinity of which there is no building material. The time when this trespass was committed, the amount and value of the Timber taken is not stated by Mr Harris. You are therefore directed to ascerta- in and report these facts to this office. You will notify the parties herein referred to, to cease their depredations upon public timber and  should they desire to settle for the amount of timber already taken you will require them as a condition precedent thereto to submit to you a full statement under oath, showing the time and place where the trespass was committed, and the quantity of timber cut and removed, which state- ment you will forward to this office  Very Respectfully Wm Armstrong Acting Commissioner  Signed  Now Bro Taylor we want some counsel to know what to do.

Your letter by brother Jackson Stewart was received yesterday evening, and in reply to a question, if there were any further instructions for brother George, we say to you, that if the weather should unfortunately set in very severe before you are enabled to reach your destination, we would recommend to you, if you cannot get further than Salt Creek, that we want a good settlement there; if you can get as far as Beaver Creek and should get hemmed in with winter, we also want a good settlement there, and as soon as the winter disappears you can then lead out for Iron County, to fulfil your present instructions.  Should you be hemmed in by Winter at either of the before mentioned places it will be well for you to build a Fort, make yourselves secure,  and when you leave in the Spring, leave from ten to twenty men in each or either Fort until more assistance can reach them from this place. There is not the least fear, but that your cattle will do well any where on the sides of the mountains, for feed is every where abundant and fuel can be obtained in a very short distance from any point. The reason that we are so very explicit is, that you may not hurry, or kill any of your cattle, but preserve them and yourselves, and accomplish all the good you can. And may the God of Israel bless and prosper you, in all that you put your hand to do, and that you may return in safety to the bosom of your family and the society of those whom you love dear in the Kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ.

Since my return to Sunset I have been visited by a good many of the immigration and I am turning as many to St John as I can There is one feature in all our immigration this season I am very sorry to see. There is hardly a family that has emigrated to Arizona this season that have brought breadstuff enought hardly to last them to Sunset. Bro Smith has had to send hundre- ds of pounds of flour back on the road to feed the people to get them as far as here; and the hundreds of the immigration are looking to Bro Lot Smith to feed them for a year to come. And Sunset is the  only settlement in Arizona of the Saints who has a bushel of grain to spare, and he has not one bushel to spare where he should have ten to feed the multitude. And althought they raised 3000 bushels of grain at Snow-Flake when we were at Conference one half of the people of that place asked him for grain or flour to furnish them for a year to come and a great share of the Mormon people of Arizona are looking to him to furnish them bread as they did last year, but he cannot do it. He has had a good crop of wheat and corn but he cannot a quarter supply the wants of the people if they did not use a bushel at Sunset. He said to me today he would have to save all his bran and shorts to grind up for bread.  And that old fraudulent Thres- hing Machine sent here by H. Clawson has broken down so they cannot thresh what they have got until a small pinion wheel is sent from St. Louis or Z. C. M. I., he has sent to both places for it.

There is some 60 persons camped 30 miles down the river say they are poor no bread and nothing to buy it and want to wait two months for some children to be born and mothers to get well and are looking to Lot Smith to feed them while there and afterwards. And there is certainly a peculiar spirit with many of the emigrants this season, they seem to think and even say that Bro Lot Smith is under obligation to feed them and never think of paying anything for what they do get. In fact one man said that belongs to the poor camp of 60 that come to get flour, meat and molasses that his company was not going hungry as long as Lot Smith had wheat or corn.

You met to greet Prophets, Apostles and inspired men. This is a privilege, which no other generation of young people have enjoyed for eighteen hundred years, until Joseph Smith, the Prophet was raised up to lay the foundation of the Church and Kingdom of God on the earth; a privilege for which I would have felt amply repaid if I had to travel a thousand miles, in the days of my boyhood to have witnessed. Now my young friends I wish you to remember these scenes  you are witnessing, during the visit of President Young and his brethren—You, my young friends, treasure up the teach- ings and saynings of these Prophets and Apostles as precious treasures while they are living men and don't wait until they are dead. aA few days and President Young and his brethren—those Prophets and Apostles and Bros Maughan will be in the Spirit world, you should never forget this visitation.

To the Citizens of Washington Co.  We embrace the opportunity afforded us by the return of the Hon. Jacob Hamblin to address you a few lines in relation to your agricultural pursuits. The president and Board, as well as the members, of the Agricultural So- ciety feel a deep interest in your industrial enterprises, and especially in the production of cotton, which is a staple very much needed, and as a home production will scarcely rank second to any other.  Premiums will be offered by the Society this season, which will be calculated to stimulate a competition in the various settlements of your country. You have every reason, so far as we have been acquainted, to anticipate success in cotton culture; the sums offered by the Society as premiums, though small, will be sufficient to en- courage many to pay more particular attention to cotton culture, especially those who cultivate small por- tions of land, than has hitherto been done. Efforts are making, which we think will be crowned, no doubt,  with success, to introduce machinery for cotton man- ufacture, some of which will be brought this season.  The introduction of every staple in these mountains has been attended with more or less difficulty. If you do not become discouraged, your success is certain.

I have sent some to you and President Young by Elder Rockwood and others, and will continue to send as often Ias I have an opportunity. From  the Herrald, you will draw an idea of the signs of the times throughout the word since you left the States. Elder Appleby has kept a record of affairs as they have transpired during the past season for the benefit of the Church which He may forward to you soon. I have also watched the signs, And occasionally made an Extract in my Journal, and on the first day of January 18489 I recorded A summary or synopsis of the same, A portion of which I will forward in this communiac- ation to you: As it may in some measure be interesting to have A view of things, As they are passing in  Great Babylon, which is separated from you by the sage deserts, And High Mountains of Israel.  "Thus ends the year of eighteen hundred and forty Eight. A Year big with with Events. A year in  which the fig treees tree hath rapidly put forth her leaves and blossomed for the summer. A year which has laid the foundation for the fulfillment of more prophecy and Revelation than whole centauries in other ages. Thrones have been cast down, whole kingdoms overturned, And the  Power of the Pope of Rome laid prostrate, and He driven from his kingdom. All the Nations of the Earth convulsed. Revolutions, wars, Anarchy, and confusion have followed each other in rapid succession. Cholera, plagues, fire and famine followed in the train. And last of all though not least in importance is the foundation laid for the disolution of the Amarican Goverment. While these theings are going on, The Ottoman Empire with many of the Nations of the East have  come to the conclusion that the Jews are human beings, and are now saying to them, you may now go home, And rebuild Jerrusalem and your Temple and we will help you. These are some of the  leading features of the signs of the times of Eighteen hundred forty Eight.  The revolutions of France. The people rose in mass, had three days fight at the end of which they drove Louis Philipi King of the French out of the kingdom with all the Royal family. The people entered the Turrelles, took the Throne upon their shoulders, carried it into the streets, and dashed it to peaces upon the ground. The people then undertook to Esstablish a  Republican Goverment. It was said there were ownly 500 killed the first three days fight, afterwords A reaction took place when it was reported that some 15000 were killed. They have  since organized, And Jerman states and Prusia next followed in Revolution, which still remians unsettled.

On sunday morning after our return I was called upon by Bro Lot Smith to bless a fine son of his 10 days old, born to him in our absence by his wife Alice Ann Richards Smith weighing 11 lbs when born. I sealed upon him the name of Wilford Woodruff by request of his father. I hope these babies may live and make better men than their namesake. I have had a good deal of time to read, meditate, and pray since I have been on this mission. I have read the Bible, Book of Mormon, Doctrines and Covenants since being here besides the Hystory of France and England and McCabes Hystory of the World, Blair's Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres and other works. I have read a good deal more than I can remember or have digested, but I have found the Sacred books very profitable to me. I could hardly have believed that I could have been as contented as I have been on this mission. I have had nothing else to do but to try to do good, preach the gospel, strengthen the   Saints, to visit the Lamanites and try to build up Zion. I have had no desire for gold, Silver property on speculation. I have had no use for money, occasionally somebody would give me 2 or 3 dollars, I would give it away the first charit- able chance I had. All my wants have been supplied. The Saints would take no money from me for anything done for me. Bro Lot Smith has supplied me with all the clothing I have wanted reward and why should not I be contented and happy under the circumstances in which I have been placed. Among other blessings I have had a good Sister McNeil ready to come at my call to offici- ate as my scribe or copyist and I think there is great necessity for this for I think sometimes I have mur- dered more paper than any man living on earth of my age.

The Irish have made A struggle to throw off the British Yokke Yoke, but they have failed in it. Yet their is trouble brewing for the British Goverment. The Roman Empire have risen up in their strength, And compelled the Pope to make change after change, And at last have dashed his power to the Earth, Assassin- ated his counsellors, And driven him from his Papal seat and Throne, which has never befor been vacated for more than one thousand years. And He has had to seek protection by flexing fleeing to other Nations. The world are ready to cry out that it is strange indeed that republican- ism is about to plant ists standard at the seat of the Mother of Abominations, the head of Rome. The Nations of the Earth at the same time are begining ^to say^ to the despised Jew, outcast and down trodden for Eighteen centuries you, too, are at last discovered to be a man—with the common Elements of Humanity—you, too must be free, you may not ownly enjoy the rights of citizenship but you may return home to the land of Jerrusalem, And lay the foundation of  your Temple once more, more glorious than at the begining. "This sentiment has the past year for the first been formerly recognized not ownly by the Sultan but by nearly all the great powers, including the English, Russian, and Italian." One glorious feature in the Revolutions of  Europe and the signs of the times is that it is dashing in peaces and breaking asunder all bars and petitions against the introduction of the proclamtion of the gospel of Jesus Christ to all the world. Go forth, now ye Elders of Israel, and make A proclamation of "this gospel of the Kingdom to Evry nation, kingdom, tounge, and people, under the whole Heaven as A witness unto them that the End may come" I judge from A letter written by Elder Orson Spencer that some from England are preparing to improve the present opportunity of spreading the gospel to those Nations. He says "There will soon be some vary Effecient preaches in the French Nations. We also have A learned Hindo in this country that speaks more than A dozen different languages Arabic andc who is preparing to go to Asia to preach the gospel soon." While these things are going on in the East yet as for a moment turn our thoughts to the Position of Blood stained America. A Nation though Blessed above all other Nations under Heaven, yet she has of late been guilty of sheding the blood of Apostles, Prophets, Patriarchs, and Saints. she has sufferd mob rule, to take the place of constitution law and order, and what position do we find her in at the close of this year. Not ownly one of her states, Ohio has disgraced herself by sitting having a legislator sit for weeks and spend their time fighting for the mastery instead of doing the business of the People. But the leaders of the whole Nation at Washington are engendering the spirit of Party strife, hatred, disunion and war, meeting in separate parties and laying plans for the dissolving of the Union and the Annihilation of the American Government And James Gordon Bennett of the New York Herrald, And other Editors after Prophesying month after month that there was no dangers of dissolving the Union, are with all there prophesies recorded in their paper staring them in their face, under the neccessity of recording the account of the parties, ways, And means, made use of to accomplis And bring to pass the vary things they had ENDENTRY I occassionally feel a desire to be with my Quorum in Salt Lake City in their Prayer circles, and to occupy a seat with them in the Tabernacle and join them in bearing record and testimony of the Kingdom of God and warning the people of that which is to come. Then again I reflect and understand that there are already more Apostles in Salt Lake who are lifting up their voices and declairing the word of the Lord unto both Saints and Sinners than they will listen to with in faith and carry out their counsel and I fear this is the case with many who profess to be Saints The year 1880 is ushered in with a strong determinat- ion of our Government to make war upon the Saints and Kingdom of God, but they will prevail no farther than the Lord permits. They are in His hands as well as we are. And the warfare is between God and the Nation and He will prevail.  When the Elders in Ohio in 1831 called upon  the Lord to stay His hand in Judgment upon the Nation, the Lord informed them He could not deny His word, but exhorted the Elders to ENDENTRY 3  The Board will award about 260 dollars, in 20 premium, for cotton, varying from 30 to about 5 dollars each, on fields varying from half an acre to ten acres each; also about 90 dollars as preminum for tobacco, and about 50 dollars for dye-stuffs.  We forward with this, a number of circulars of the Board, from which you will see the recom- mendation of the parent society, of the organization of branch societies. It is our wish that you or- ganize a society in your county. The Com- mittee to make the award or premiums will be chosen from among yourselves.  We request the bishops, their counsel- ors, teachers, and all the Elders, to use their influ- ence and exertions to lay the foundation for the clothing of Israel with garments of their own make, as a religious duty, as well as a meas- ure of political economy, public policy, and absolute necessity for the benefit of the kingdom of God.  You have doubtless the best climate in the Territory for the production of fruit, especially the culture of the grape. We hope that the en- terprise and energy of the citizens will not let these advantages lie unimproved To supply Zion with the choice wines of her own make, for her Sacraments, as contemplated in the ENDENTRY labor faithfully and prune the vineyard for the last time. The 166 and 167 pages of the D.C. as well as the 45 section as well as other revelations show what the Lord intends doing and He will not deny His Word in these instances than in the former. As a people we should trust in God and exercise faith in His word. I feel that Bro Cannon has a hard warfare during this Session of Congress and needs the faith, prayers and support of all the Saints.  It is a general time of health with the people of this country. I have just heard from a letter from Farmington, that Bro Thomas Smith was appointed to take 100 or 150 families and start in March to come to St John. I have just been conversing with Bp Freeman and Lot Smith who came through in February. They think Feb. would be a better month than March to cross the Sevier country and Buckskin Mountains. They think in March it is more stormy and roads breaking up than Feb. and if they put it off much later ENDENTRY been prophesying against. And while the senators and statesmen from the slaves states meet in convention and resolve, that if slavery is Abolished or prohibited in the District of Columbia or the Territories of Calafornia, that they will immediately dissolve the Union, ^and^ lay taxes upon the shipping of the free states. At the same time citizens and statesman of the free states meet in convention, And Resolve that if those things are not done that they will dissolve the Union. While these parties are growing more and more determined and further and wider Apart, still the public mind seem to be blinded as to the  result of these resolutions, And seem ignorant concerning the fruit which will be produced from the seed of their own sowing. yes they have eyes but see not, ears but hear not, and hearts but do not understand, while the servants, of God filled with inspiration, can behold the scene in its true light, And comprehends the result with as much certainty as did Lot, and Jesus, each in their day while beholding the conduct of the Antedolouvi- ans, Jerruselem. And as the words of the Lord were fulfilled in the former case, in like manner will they be in the latter. During the past year the Asiatic Cholera one of the plagues of the last days has again made its appe- arance throughout England and Memphis Missiissippi River the last accounts say about 100 deaths daily in New Orleans. Crime of evry kind has apparently increased throughout the United States during the past year, 100 per cent, it appears as though the cup of their iniquity was full, And the hour of their judgment had come, And that calamity, confusion sorrow And Death had recieved their commission to visit this land, And in some instances the hearts of man are begining to fail them for fear of those things coming on the Earth. And their cry is that an awful uncertainty is resting upon all things. I cannot close my Record upon the signs of the times of 1848 without turning my eye towards Zion, yes Zion, which is not now merely a phantom of the brain or a name, but actually a living thing, truly she is yet but a babe, just born, yet she has a tabernacle, the mountains of Israel, her bed is in the chamber of the rocks, her garden one of the rich gard valleys of Ephraim. She speaks; And her vioice is as the voice of GOD. She has A spirit which burns likes flames of fire she has power, and has started a little stone a rolling ^from the mountain her habitation^ which increases as it goes, it is causing the Earth to quake and tremble, take care ye nations it will grind you to dust. She has messangers which go and come at her bidding, one of them can chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, they command the Elements and they obey them. She has an Ensign for the Nations to flee to, she has A law which will soon govern the Earth. She is born in the generation that David had a view of. O Praise the Lord I am a witness that mine Eyes have beheld her. She has keys to open, And no man can shut, or shut and no man can open. Her power is from Heaven, whare she has noble senators who plead her cause both day and night. This is the Zion I seek after, this is the Zion I speak off. Her Church is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. Her city was sought out in 1847. And the Lord has favored her from that time, And during the year 1848 the Church has been organized with ENDENTRY than this that they will hardly have time to put in spring crops, the companies who come in the spring should make some arrangements to bring breadstuff with them, but if there could be arrangements so that flour could be collected at Kanab it would be better than to haul it from Northern Utah. Another thing I want to name, those who are coming expecting to pay for land, if they could bring money instead of stock. I  think it would be better for there is such a loss of stock in driving them it would be better and much less money trouble to bring money than stock And the men we bought St John of said ^if^ they could get all the money down they would take $10 a head instead of the cows but they will take cows at any time I think from $13 to $15 a head I think those who have money should bring it instead of stock. Those who could sell their stock for money would do well to do it. But as I have lengthened out my communication altogether beyond what I expected I will close. If you   can spare time and patience to read it I will endeavor not to be so lengthy in my next.   My love to yourself and Council.  Br Smith wishes to be remembered to you all.  That the blessings of God may sustain you and give you the victory over all your enemies is the constant prayer of your Brother in the gospel  W.

Willard Richards, who have gatherd to the Mountains of Israel in the valleys of the Great Basin North America, And taken with them some three thousand saints, with there flocks and herds which makes A population of about seven thousands souls in the City of the Great Salt Lake. The Lord has also blest their land which has brought forth in Abundance. And while ^the^ Lord has ^been^ multiplying blessing upon Zion in her quiet habitation, Her messengers have been crying aloud to the Nations of the Earth and the Isles of the sea, preaching the gospel unto the and uttering their testimony in the power of God and the gift of the Holy Ghost, untill they have gatherd their thousands together, untill one of the Twelve Apostles of the Lamb, (Orson Pratt), Estimates that it will take three hundred ships to remove the saints from the British Isles alone to the land of Zion. The saints who were gathered in the valley of the Sacramento, have discoverd such vast mines of gold, silver, copper and other precious ores that the report of it is creating great excitement throughout the world, Esspecially in the United States, untill tens of thousands are rushing to the gold regions to try to obtain the precious mettal. And as the hand of God has been so visible in all the signs of 1848, may He continue his work through 1849, and All following years, untill His Arm shall be made bare in the eyes of all Nations, untill Zion shall shall arive to her full strength of Manhood. "for Brass may she have gold, for Iron silver, for wood Brass, and for stones Iron, may her Exacters and peace officers be rightous men, may her Nobles be of Ephriam and Her Governoorr procede out of the midst of him. may all of her messengers be armed with righteousness in the power of God in great glory. May all the Nations of the Earth fear and tremble because of her Law, may the wicked find her sons terrible when they go to Battle against her and not have power to stand before them. May her dwelling places be disting- uished by A pillar of fire by night And A cloud by day, And in fine may she arise and shine forth And spread Herself abroad with all that perfection of beauty, power and glory which has ever been spoken concerning her, even to the full Expectation of GOD, Angels, and Men.

ENDENTRY Bro Taylor, there is another subject I wish to say a few words upon (although it is against the wish of Bro Brigham City, and St Joseph who live in the United Order have been verry zealous to sustain the Z.C.M.I. in Salt Lake in all their purchases but they have been the most unfortunate of human beings in all their deal with that Institution, especially in all Machinery. Bro Smith sent money to buy the best threshing machine in market, sent to R Burton and E. F. Sheets to help pick it out, it was put into Hiram Clawsons hands and he sent an old Whitmans threshing machine that he had had on hand a long time and could not sell to any body else, and it was freighted down here to Sunset 700 miles and as soon as it was opened it would have been taken back if it had not been more than 300 miles. it has been a curse to them ever since it was brought here, in spite of all they can do it wastes grain and only can thresh   ENDENTRY from 200 to 300 Bushels a day with the best of attention, and all three of these settlements have to depend on it to thresh their wheat. it is now brok- en down so that it cannot be be used at all until a pinion wheel is sent from St. Louis or Z.C.M.I. Bro Smith has sent to both places for me. He sent for a bill of goods to the Co-op. when it came to Sunset it all came in one box Indigo, Alum, Logwood Madder, slates, pencils, school books andc, all mixed ^together^ in one compound. There has been something wrong with almost every piece of machinery sent for, last spring they sent to Z. C.M.I. for a two horse large sized Molasses cane mill. It was put into the hands of H Clawson who sent a small one horse mill with some parts missing when it arrived. It was entirely too small for their use and last of all though not least they wanted to start a tannery had their vats in place and tanner and materials all on hand, they wanted a bark mill and sent money by Bro Flake and when he arrived   at Salt Lake requested the Beaver Co-op. who is dealing with the Z C.M.I. to send for a bark mill for the Sunset Tannery, Bro Smith had to send on extra team to the ferry to bring it but when it arrived behold! and Lo! it turned out to be a little giant, a corn-cob mill and not suitable for grinding bark at all, now all has to wait until a bak^r^k mill can be bought at St Louis, brought to the terminns by rail and then freighted from there by way of Albuquer- que. Now is not this enough to try the patience of Saints,? to say nothing about sinners, I think it is. I think that persons living as far from Salt Lake as these settlements are who wish to patronize their own Institutions and pay down should have a little care and pains taken for them and not make such blunders as have been made towards them. The people of this country do not think that Bro Clawson has done them justice. They did not know   ENDENTRY President, Hyrum Rich; Vice President, Wm. Robt. Pope; Secretary, John W.

BOX 321,  Salt Lake City, Utah, 24 Sept. 1886  President John Taylor. Friday.  Dear Brother.  To-day I received the following letter from Bro. W. W., which he requested me to copy and forward to you, as his handwriting is hardly legible in many places, being done rather hastily in his peculiar style of penmanship.  Respectfully, J. Jaques.  Sept. 23, 1886.  Presidents John Taylor and G. Q. Cannon.  Dear Brethren—Last evening I had an interview with Brother J. Jaques, and he brought me your favor of Sep. 20, which I read with much interest.  I have just arrived in Salt Lake County. Among other things I had some private business I could not well attend to while absent. Then again, my intention is to take Emma south with me for the winter. Brother Wm. H. Thompson brought me up, and ENDENTRY expects to take me back in a week or ten days. It was said to Adam it was not good to be alone. I have been alone a great deal since I have been a married man, and for the last two years I have not been with any of my family but very little, with the exception of riding with Ashley, and since I last wrote you I have been having some very poor turns of what is called Bright's disease, or kidney disease, the worst I have every had. In one instance I became almost blind, speechless, and had loss of memory for half an hour. My senses then all returned. I was very weary at the time, having travelled about 40 miles that day. Notwithstanding this, my vital health is good. I have lost considerable flesh this season. I thought I had better have one of my wives spend the winter with me and nurse me. I have travelled 1000 miles since the first of June in lumber wagons, though I had a spring seat the last 350 miles. I am in Salt Lake County. I do not pretend to go to the houses of any of my families. Very few know that I am in the county. The fewer who know of our whereabouts the ENDENTRY L. D. S. Historian's Office, P. O. BOX 321,  Salt Lake City, Utah, 24 Sep. 1886  better, especially yours.  I thought I would take the first oppor- tunity to notify you that I was in the county, so that if there was any item of business of any kind that I could per- form of any interest to the kingdom of  God while here I wish to do it. I came very quietly through the count^r^y. None know of my coming, except a few safe individuals where we stopped. The Temple opened again on the 15th.  Now, dear brethren, I want to lay before you my feelings. I have never felt better in my life, in spirit, than to-day. I have been blessed, as you have, with bodily health and strength to a good old age. We have both been preserved in life while the prophets and apostles and thousands of the Saints have been called into the spirit world, for the Lord has taken whom he would take, and preserved in life whom he would preserve. I have been trying to get ready when called to go. As to the infirmities of the body, I expect them, I have them. As to the infirm- ENDENTRY
