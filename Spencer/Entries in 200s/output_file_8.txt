Pratt wished me to say to the Presidencythat there were many Elders in England of power faith& talent who had to labour hard to get bread for therefamilies And when Elders were sent to them from America who had not talent & could not edify them they felt it was A tax upon them that there own Elders 
 were more capable to Edify them than those that were sent unto them And when men were sent they shouldbe such as could Edify & instruct. I spent the night at Brother Hydes with Elder Pratt 18 milesMay 19, 1850 ~ Sunday19th [FIGURE] According to appointment I met in conference with Orson Hyde Orson Pratt And the High Council near the stand in the grove, one hour before the general meeting Elder Hyde Addressed the council in substance as followsThat there was business left unfinished at the conferencewhich must be closed to day As osome officers are going tothe valley others must be appointed. Bishop Johnson was going Another Bishop must be appointed Also men must beappointed to visit the various branches who would attendthe council & carry the spirit of the council to the people & bring back the spirit of the cPeople to the council. Joseph Young & Benjamin Clapp who were appointed last Yearwere not with them at all ieither in Body or spirit & whenever they did attend A council Joseph Young could not stay till He went away we will pass them over & let them go. Elder Hyde also remarked that it was necessary to make arangements to receive the poor that had of late arived among us I have given council through theguardian for the poor not to come here & some have contrary to this councisl through tha misguided zeal councilled them to come to this place & such must bear the consequences of it. It was voted that A Bishop be appointed to take the place of Bishop Johnson, & that Elder Stodard be appointed to travel among the Churches & call suchmen to his help as He needed. Three men were Appointedas A committe to locate the poor.We then repairedto the Stand before the congregation & each item ofbusiness was presented before the people the same as before the council And a vote taken upon eachitem Elder Hyde made many remarks upon each item as they came up before the people Among other things saidthat the Priesthood & Saints Held the keys of Blessingsin there own hands & said we have not had but oneshower of rain this year or since last fall & we havenot seen the bow in the Heavens at all this season theearth is parched up & dry now if you want rain open your doors & receive the poor And you will havethe Blessings the people said they would do it &Elder Pratt Prayed for rain. Elder Hyde Also wished the sin course & evil that arose in that place from thegrog shops should rest upon the Head of those who kept such dogeries & the people said Amen to itIn the Afternoon Elder O. Pratt Preached to the peoplein an Edifying manner spoke Also against the Grog shops Also of his travel in England the progress of the work in that land the many thousands who were coming into the church the great increase of the publications theopposition that was begining to be manifest against them spoke of the signs of the times the building 
 of the city of Zion the peculiarity of that city having A pillar of fire by nigh & a cloud by day resting overthe Habitations of the saints Elder Pratt spoke quite leangthy upon these points when He closed He was followed by Elder W. Woodruff who spoke brieflyupon a few item He manifested much pleasure in once more meeting with the saints said He had been ona mission to the East nearly two years He could not give so flattering account of matters as Elder PrattHad for the field in the Eastern States had beenlike the gleaning of grapes after the vintage was done thare had been Baptized in his field of labour about 200 since he had been on his mission. Asthere had been much said about the poor coming to kanesville Elder Woodruff remarked that He had recieved council fromthe Presidency in the valley to stretch out his arms andgather all He possibly could to Zion. And when the Lord tells me to do any thing or I receive council through the proper sourse I go at it with all my might And I can neither eat Drink or sleep in peace except the work that is requ-ired of him me to be performed is progressing about right I have laboured hard to gather out the people according to the instructions given me. One company started from Philadelphia under Elder Gibson of [blank] I Also started fromBoston on the 9th with 209 And from St Louis with 225 & we arived here in safety & there are a few poor who came with me who cannot go through & will stop here & if in my zeal to carry out the instruction of the Presidency I have been instrumental in causing more poor saints to come to Kanesville than ought to have come it has been an Error of the head & not of the heart. I feel to sustainElder Hyde in the course He has taken here in taking a stand against drunkenness gambling stealing Bogasmaking & iniquiti[es] of all kinds. there is order in the kingdom of God. the Presidency inof the Church are the first to receive & give instructi[on] to the whole Church & Elder Hyde is the president in this place & the one to receive & give instructions & He is accoun[table]for his course to the Presidency of the Church, other remar[ks] were made & was followed by Elder Hyde who said that wha[t] Elder Woodruff had done was all right & would work for good & other remarks were made He then gave council for the Brethren who had farms to sell & were thinking of going to theValley to take this as an omen that it was right for them [to] go if they could sell them for what they were worthto sell them & go if not to stay and till them unlessthey felt disposed to give them to some poor brethrenthe conference was dismissed & though there had not beena shower of rain but once since last fall & the bow had not been seen since last year yet as soon as meeting was dismissed the clouds gatherd the rain poured down theBow appeared And it was a matter of observation with many of the world as well as Saints.

 July 30, 1850 ~ TuesdayJuly 30th 1850 [FIGURE}Our encampment or the first division of it was calledto pass through one of those horrid scenes to day which areso much dredded by all emigrating companies on the plaines which was a stampede of all the ox teams with the family waggons of the first division with the exception of the 10 baggage who were in the rear. No person who has not experienced or witnessed one of athose dredful scenes cannot form any correct idea of them and it is almost impossi-ble to give a correct description of it for to behold 30 or 40 ox teams from 2 to five yoke of oxen in each team attachedto a family waggon of goods & women & children all in an instant like the twinkling of an eye be deprived of all reason, sens, & government & be filled with madness frantic & fright & all dart off with lightning speed each running their own way, roaring bellowing rolling & tumbling over each other waggons upsetting smashing their wheels ex[l]es & tongues spilling the goods women & childin the street, for the next teams to trample undertheir feet as they roar & charge on their way with their yokes bows & chains flying in evry direction is a scene not easily imagined or described. A stampede ofox teams is much more horrid than horse teams as there is bits in the horses mouth that he may in a great measurebe guided though under full speed, but not so with the ox. He goes where ever his fancy or will may lead himThis stampede in the folling manner commenced. Willford commenced getting onto his horse & while getting onWilliam Murphy started his horse into a run & the horseflung Wilford over his head onto the ground the saddle turnedunder his belly & he run and as he approached one of the waggons Mr Cannons team became frantic & dart off with great speed & in a moment 20 or 30 teamsfollowed the same example and the whole encampment apparently was rushing into the jaws of Death. I was by my carriage when it commenced drawn by a noble fine black steed Rhoda Foss & Susan Woodruff was in thecarriage at the head of the Company. At this moment I saw Mrs Woodruff rush into the midst of the scene whareshe was in danger of her life evry instant with manyother women & children, I told Rhoda to let the horse runinto the bluffs & do the best she could I hit him a blow to start him into a run & left them to their chance & the care of providence & rushed into the midst of the stampede to try to save the life of my wife & as manyothers as possible but I had hard work to save my own life Mrs Woodruff soon found an opening & fled out of the midst of it Brother Pettys two waggons was turnedover my family waggon with 4 yoke of oxen ran ove[r] one of his waggons & a waggon run over one of his childrenBrother Badlam waggon or team ran over one of Samuel Hardys children Prescott Hardy was knocked down by his ownteam & badly wounded in the thigh & arm whareever I  
 saw women or children in danger I done what I couldto rescue them little can be done at such times ownly for each one to dodge the best he can & save his own life if possiblewhen I found I could do no more for the encampment ingeneral I run forward to see what state my carriage & family waggons & family was in I found my noble horse still a running but on three legs Rhoda was knockedout of the Carriage & Susan was lying flat upon thebottom with her feet hanging out between the wheels & she was screaming aloud. I hollowed for her to hold on untill I come she did so untill I caught thehorse by the bit & stoped him & rescued her. One of the ox teams had run onto the horse & carriage had bent one of [the] ex[l]es smashed one of the horses legs topeaces & knocked Rhoda out of the carriage. As soonas I got the horse out of the carriage I went through the encampment to see who was dead & maimed and I was asstonished to find that no one was killed & but one badly wounded & but little damage done to waggons or oxen and to look it all over it looked like a miriacle to see how so many escapedI had to shoot my horse to get him out of his misery which was painful to me but I was thankful my wife children & friends were well & their lives preservedJuly 31, 1850 ~ Wednesday31st Elder L Hardy was vary low to day and I am nearly worn out with hard labour & care we travled 21 miles & camped on the bank at the crossing of the south fork of the Platt 20 miles from Ash HollowAugust 1, 1850 ~ ThursdayAug 1st We forded the Platt River with our teams to dayIt was a hard days work it required 8 or 10 yoke of oxen to draw a ton across the river it was about half a mileacross I got some goods wet.August 2, 1850 ~ Friday2nd we lost 20 head of oxen which detained a part of the oxen waggon I started out all that were able to go the rest of us went out to hunt cattle I found them in the bluffs in a bason & drove them into camp the men many of them had gone hunting cattleI yoked the oxen & with the assistance of women & childrenI drove the encampment on & soon the men returnedfrom hunting oxen they found their encampment gone& followed on & over took us we got along well untill we came to go down those tremendious bluffs intoAsh Hollow. Here Watts & Bess both smashed each a hind wheel to peaces & broke evry spoke out I workeduntill eleven oclok at night to get the broken waggon into camp & then left them by the way side & walked into Ash Hollow & camped for the night wearied out. 20 mAugust 3, 1850 ~ Saturday3rd the day was spent setting tire & mending waggonsAugust 4, 1850 ~ Sunday4th Sunday I spent the day in camp Had a meeting with the Saints.

 as high up the piller as possible the whole appearance of Chimney Rock would indicate that the Ancient Nephites or some one els had built the mound & erected a great towerupon the top of it and the whole formation of the bluffs in this region of country appears more like the ruins of Ancientcities than of Nature, we had a hard thunderstorm& travled several miles in it we camped 6 miles east of Scotts BluffAugust 14, 1850 ~ Wednesday14th Travled to scotts & Elder Allexander Badlam & myself explored scotts Bluffs from top to bottom for about 10 milesthey hed many grand formations of Nature in some places we rolled of[f] large rocks of near a tons weight that would gothundering down the mountains & into the vale beneath levelling the ceders to the earth & starting the woolves from their hiding places as it bounded on its way for half a mile from its starting pointAfter spending several hourse of hard labour though plesantly among those grand lofty ruins or bluffs we left them & returned to camp we passed Burdoe trading post He inquired for me but I did not see him Brother Currier turned his waggon bottom side upwards down a bluff broke things bad, the Indians tried to raise a stamp-ede among us but did not do it travled 20 miles & campedAugust 15, 1850 ~ Thursday15th Rode to Horse creek & camped 12 miles good grass & waterAugust 16, 1850 ~ Friday16th Drove 16 miles without water camped on the plattAugust 17, 1850 ~ Saturday17th Drove 12 miles & camped on the Platt near Indian lodges theIndians had the small pox many Died with it one child left to Die the lodges deserted the child cralled out came towards us as we passed by for bread we gave him some to eatAugust 18, 1850 ~ Sunday18th A rainy day drove to Laramie fork crossed it went to Fort Laramie drove 1 1/2 miles from Laramie camped on the Platthad a cold rain storm through the nightAugust 19, 1850 ~ Monday19th The rain continued through the day an exceding cold day through the day & nightAugust 20, 1850 ~ Tuesday20th I have one fine ox dead this morning the Camp moved on 5 miles & camped we remained in camp I traded someAugust 21, 1850 ~ Wednesday21st I bought three yoke of oxen at $60 each I went on to our encampment 5 miles & spent the nightAugust 22, 1850 ~ Thursday22nd Travled over the Hills to Bitter Creek 15 miles & campedAugust 23, 1850 ~ Friday23rd We travled 20 miles on the river road & camped forthe night on the platt saw one buffaloAugust 24, 1850 ~ Saturday24th I met with Elders J.

 is right. In what way is this to be done by sealing upon the head of the prophet Joseph those keys to remain in the Church & kingdom of God untill the winding up scene the Elders of this Church know those keys were sealed upon the head of Joseph Smith & still remain in the Churchwhat are they to accomplish as the saints could notbe perfect in former days with out the Latter day Saints Neither can we be perfect without our Fathers who have died for many generations & these keys of Elijah confirmed upon the president of the church are to seal the fathers to their children the children to their fathers, & to assist in welding the great link connecting evry gospel dispensation togeth-er I see the wheat growing in this dispensation ripening for theharvest I see the tares also growing for the burning I saw [say] to the wheat & tares grow on I sawy to the Goats & sheep both to go ahead unto the End, the Saints of God are increasing in knowledge fast but they have got to be a hundred times better, wiser & advance in knowledge befor the end I havewatched the windings & progress of this people & the spiritsthat surround them I have seen many arise as it were to Heaven & in a moment of temptation fall down to Hell and loose their hop[e]s of glory I know the spirits of men & the invisible spirits that affect men & operate upon them better than I do the faces of men I want to speak a little upon natural philosophy we sow the grain it dies, rots in the ground & then itbrings forth a hundred fold the elements which surrounded us produce these effects if we had a correct knowledge of theelements & knew how to control & separate them we could make bread as well out of the elements as Jesus did when He fed the multitude. the day will come when we can go [on] a Journey without taken any food with them would have power to make it as they went along.

During the pasage of this ordinance many interesting remarks were made by the president or Govournor of the state He says we do not want the church to pass laws to punish crime ownly to try members on church fellowship if the members shall transgress the laws of the Land turn them over to the Laws of the Land but we want to protect the church in their right of worship & so we will evry other sect that comes here when the kingdoms of this world become the kingdom of Our Lord & Savior Jesus Christ will they all be members of the Church of Jesus Christ & obey the gospel No not one 8th part of them No more than the Telestial kingdom is a Celestial one and they stand in about the same relationship one to the other. If asociety of the shaking quakers was to come here & settle inthis valley & wanted a charter to be protected in their worsh-ip let us give them one & if they believe it right not to marry a woman let them live without it & not compel them to itso if the Latter Day Saints wish to have more wives than one to live holy & raise up holy seed unto the Lord let them enjoy that privilege Now the Gentile Christian Nations & Legislatores guard vary strictly against passing any laws to do away with whore-doms but they will make it almost Death for a man to have two wives but they will have as many whores as they please yes thou-sands upon thousands of the Christian Nations are rotting withthe pock & filty corruption & they think this is all right but for a righteous man to have several wives like AbramIsaac & Jacob, David & others to raise up a holy seed unto theLord & will keep themselves pure before God they think thisis an awful sin but if I had power I would take all good virtueous females from all wicked corrupt adulterous husbands & give them to holy men of God that they may raise up seed unto the Lord I have more wives than one I have many and I am not ashamed to have it known some deny in thestates that we have more wives than one I never deny it I am perfectly willing that the people at Washington should know that I have more than one wife & they are pure before the Lord and are approved off in his sight I have been commanded of God to persue this course &c many other interesting remarks were made

 March 2, 1851 ~ Sunday[FIGURE] March 2nd 1851 Sunday The Assembly was addressedby P. P. Pratt as a farewell address on his taking his leave on a foreign mission Among his remarks he said he had been connected with this church about twenty one years. He had laboured travled Joyed Sorrowed felt & experienced with them during that time He hadseen men rise & fall & one thing he wished to speak off he had seen many of the Sisters in at various times feel disposed to marry out of the Church & think their is no harm in it they can marry a Gentile and no harm in it. But what is the truth in the case it is the same now as anciently for instance in the days of Noah the daughters of Noahmarried out of the Church in some instances & were not saved with him in the ark but they & their seed were cut off fromthe Earth forever. So with Lot some of his daughtersmarried Gentiles out of the Church while in Sodom & Gomorrowand would not go out with their Father Lot but were destroy-ed they & their posterity from off the Earth so it is with the Sisters in the Church in this day those who marry out of theChurch marry those who are doomed to destruction & theirposterity while those who are in the Church & are faithfulwill live & their children to the last Generation. Brother Pratt exhorted the Saints to unite in building up the kingdomof God He felt that their was a good spirit generally prevail-ing in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints He was going on a long mission He wanted the prayers of the saints inhis behalf & those who were going with him that they mightsave the souls of men & open the gospel to those of other tongues& languages I think the time has come when it should be donebut I feel that I can do nothing of myself in this matter exc[ept]the Lord helps me. I feel thankful that I can leave my family & children here in the midst of the Saints I do not wish to go to the states to preach the gospel to the nation that has drivenus out if they want the Gospel let them come and ask for itas we have travled with blistered feet to carriey it to them &then, then they would curse us for it many other good remarks were made by Elder Pratt.President Young addressed the meeting some minutes before it closed concerning the building of the public works & other thingswe met in the upper room for Prayer & had a good timeMarch 3, 1851 ~ Monday3rd ^[FIGURE]^ I spent the day in the upper room in council I ordained one High Priest & one to the Quorum of the Seventies I administered to 7 others & addressed the saints in the afternoonMarch 4, 1851 ~ Tuesday4th I spent the day at home & made 10 rods of post & boardfence on 1st west Temple streetMarch 5, 1851 ~ Wednesday5th I laboured at home Ezra returned at night from the herd bringing my cattle with himMarch 6, 1851 ~ Thursday6th I drove my oxen to Lorenzo Young herd distance 25March 7, 1851 ~ Friday7th I drew 16 dead oxen out of the carell & then returnedhome to the city 25

 a walk to see G. A. Smith saw mill which was up so he couldsaw. He informed us they had an abundance of coal, magn[acted]Iron, Allum salt timber &c nearby we found the Brethrenhad done much since their arival they have about 100 menhave been there 3 months. Have enclosed a fort containing 19 acre& 96 rods of ground and have ploughed & sewed about 1000 acres of wheat have fenced about 6000 acres of landHave built one saw mill and got a Cooncel House up the 1ststory. This is an important point and probably will be next to the great salt Lake in importance as they have foundan abundance of coal & IronMay 11, 1851 ~ Sunday11th Sunday It was a stormy day Br G. A Smith addressed the meeting a short time and the people was dismissedMay 12, 1851 ~ Monday12th A company started out this morning to examine the coal & Ironthe President & council remained in fort to hold a cooncil &do such business as was necessary. A meeting was called at4 oclock to ascertain the minds of the Brethren it was found about 30 wished to go home 15 to get their families & the other15 to remain at the great salt Lake each one made there excusePresident Young then addressed them & said he would express his feelings upon the subject to those who wished to go homeIf you were now on a mission to France England or any other part of the Earth preaching the gospel you would not sit down & council together about going to get your families or go home untill your mission was ended. this is of quite as much importance as preaching the gospel for the time has now come when it is required of us to make the wilderness blos-som as the rose. Our mission now is build up stakes of Zion & fill these mountains with cities & when your mission is ended you are at Liberty to go & be free & ownly do right.When I go on a mission I leave my affairs in the hands of God. If my house fields, flocks, wife or children die in my absence I say Amen to it. If they live & prosper I feel tosay Amen to it & thank the Lord. He wished the Brethren to finish the fort & secure their grain &c wished the land tobe surveyed so that the Brethren who laid the foundationcould have their choice of farms. He councelled the Brethrento buy up the Lamanite children as fast as they could & educate them & teach them the gospel so that not manygenerations they would be a white & delightsom peoplefor the Lord could not have devised a better plan than to have put us whare we are in order to accomplish this thingMay 13, 1851 ~ Tuesday13 The Saints assembled this morning & was addressed by E. T. Benson in the morning who spoke lengthy in the afternoonthe meeting was addressed By John Young J M Grant &W Woodruff who expressed their feelings upon various subj-ects B Young followed and advised to have the logs so close that arrows could not be shot into the fort. He would prefer tohave many address the saints so as to get Ideas from many than to have one occupy all the time. He wished the boundaries of the citieys to be altered on the charter as their was a mistake in also thename was to be altered from Cedar City to the Indian Name PAROWAN

If we begin right we shall go right if we begin wrong we shall keep wrongthe United States are afraid of our union & so is the worldIn speaking of the Indians he said these Indians were the descendants of the old gadianton robers who infested these mountains for more than a thousand years.we dined together in the city of Parowan & then left amid the roar of cannon & drove to red creek & camped for the night. About 30 of the citizens returned with us to go back to the Great Salt Lake CityMay 17, 1851 ~ Saturday17 we left the valley crossed the mountain & camped onBeaver creek which abounds with Beaver & trout G.

If a man is unrighteously angry he should let it sleep & not show itself untill he is rightagain. good men may be left to commit a gross sin butif he had watched closely he would have escaped the evil. theLord intends all men to be tryed in this life & if you build 
 your faith upon a true foundation that faith has got to be tryed All men have an oppertunity of appearing wise or foolish of governing themselves or making their folley manifest Peter commit a gross error had he have been on the watchtower he might have turned away in silence & not denyed his Lord. Many have been tryed & turned away from us at a time when they expected to have gained sumthing by &in doing so they have lost all. Others have been blinded & overcome & done evil then their eyes were open to see the conseq-uences. But it is the privilege of all men to live so that they can see what each act will amount to either good or evil How different the prospect would be before the world or this people ifthey would live so from what it now is. I endeavour to do right in all things & then leave the event in the hands of God & am satisfy with the result. If a man is led or tempted to do a thing that you donot comprehend the result of & that result ^not^ lead to good then let italone.During the past week one remarked to me that my observat-ions last sunday ought to be observed & was good but it ought to have been spoken in the right spirit. But I wish to say that I am satisfyed with the power & influence the Lord has given me. The Lord directs things according to his own will, I know my feelings & zeal would make my words like a sharp two edged sword so that they would seperate the sins from this people that they should practice sin no more not be tempted with it but this is not the will of God the people still must have their warfare & trial & if thestorms & waves overwhelm the ship still all is well for we havea good captain at the helm. Some people are vary anxiousto reprove others while they are wrong themselves and do not knowthe spirit they are of theiry are ready to say How do you do Peter & Judas Jesus, & How do you do Mr Devil And are vary pious but will go to Hell with their spirit & the whole world will go to Hell with the same spirit Awake ye Elders of Israel & make your calling & election sure lest you go to Hell with the wicked, I do not point you to the sectarian Hell whare Devils are tosting you with a pitchfork in the billows of Hell fire eternally. But go & mingle with the wickedin the states wrangle & fight with them get their spirit & feelings & loose the light & spirit of God & you will begin to feel the true state of the Damned. The wicked killed Jesus Christ out of mallace & wickedness & they did not know that His death was to save the world the Lord turnsmany things for good which the world means for Evil thewhole Earth is filled with misery, sin & wickedness I could find no worse Hell than to be confined among themI labour for the welfare of this whole people I wish my Brethren to be a happy free people that their course oflife may be such as to get an Eternal & temperal salvation I labour to effect this, their is time & change to all things Their has been a code of Laws given in former dayswhich was for all people which is the gospel of Jesus Christ In the dasyys of Christ the Apostles & Elders were sent outto preach the gospel & warn the people they did so but were then martered for preaching it & the saints were killed offthe Earth, that time is gone the change has come, for now 
 wisdom & ingenuety in temperal things true friendship isnot known on the Earth if it is not among this people But the friendship of this people is the fruits of the gospel of Jesus Christthis must continue to improve untill they are perfectIn speaking upon the subject of tithing the President thoughttheir had not Been $200 dollars paid in cash during the past Year inby this people in tithing but they have paid the merchants $200000 in cash, & their is now 30000 bushels of wheat due on tithing. Shall we dispens with the Law of Tithing. Dont you want a building to meet in to worship God we want a Tabernacle, & a Temple for our Endowments also a Tower to hang a bell on & we want to keep buildingup Zion that Israel may have a place of rest. if we do thiswe do our duty we have duties to perform and a warfareto accomplish but the victory will soon be ours the greatest warfare is with ourselves if we can gain a victory with ourselves so as to have peace with ourselves our wives & childn we shall do well. many other interesting remarks were made by the president. In the afternoon the meeting was addressed by O Spencer in an adifying manner. And was followed by Elder Kimball who spoke much to the edifycation of the people we had our prayer meeting in the evening & was incouncil untill 10 oclokJune 2, 1851 ~ Monday2nd June I spent the day at homeJune 3, 1851 ~ Tuesday3, I went to  porters Mill & got a load of Lumber & caught 15 troutJune 4, 1851 ~ Wednesday4th I went to see my herd of oxen that was brought downJune 5, 1851 ~ Thursday to June 7, 1851 ~ Saturday5th 6th 7th I spent the time about my labourJune 8, 1851 ~ Sunday8th Sunday President Young addressed a full assembly ofthe Saints as follows. I want to speak such things as are in my heart. All that are acquainted with me know that myreligion embraces all things that belong to the duties of life The Religion I have embraces all the principles of present future, progressive & Eternal Salvation in evry sens of the word. I labour for the salvation of myself & my Brethren I would be glad to speak to thousands even the whole world if they could hear I would not like to preach in this house to 20 or 100 personswhen more than 1000 could get in here then for 20 or 1100 more come & have to preach 20 or 50 times to have the people learn when they could learn it all at once. The President of the Seventies called a separate meeting to day I come & dismissed it what if the Twelve Seventies High Priest, Elders, priest, Teachers, Deacon & membershould do the same there would be bear walls for the house to preach to & what Good would it do. If the presidency of the seventieshave such important things to lay before the quorum as to get them to-gether on sunday let them come & teach us all. I now want to give council in this matter from this time forth & forever let not the president of any quorum ever again call a separate meeting from the public congregation unless the president of the Church [order]it. The seventies should be here and all the people should be here let the seventies Hall go & all other business when Sunday comes 
 let the Saints of God come together & hear the Elders teachApply your hearts unto wisdom & get it. If I am full of the spirit of God I shall not get any more than I want It is the duty of all to come here that can come & let the power of Eternity rest upon us and you should not be asleep but wide awake. When I contrast the present with the past situations of the Saints I[t] gives me a great variety of feelings,both good & bad Joyful & sorrowful I have seen thispeople waiding through a school of affliction they then were prayful & had faith their trying situation made them remember the Lord their God. But now prosperity is heaped upon you and as this people are to be tryed in all things when prosperity comes some forget God wax fat & rich do not realize the blessings they are enjoying. some who are in poverty abroad desire to gather with the saints when they arive & get rich they forget what they have been. Could you see the feelings of thousands now who are abroad who desire with all their hearts to come here they would be willing to lick up the dust of your feet if they could but be here they still are with the wicked Bring them here they look upon many who were poor but now rich, they then desire to be rich also they want gold & will soon be willing to sacrifice the society of the Saints & go to the gold mines & plunge themselves againinto Hell as it were from whare they came to gratify an unlawful desire thus it is with many men some were to go to the plat to Bear River & keep a ferry to get gold & wait on wicked ungodly men to get gold whare are their minds like the fools eyes. I told them I would not wait on the devils for loads of gold I would ratherstay here & serve the Lord. All I want of property isto serve the Lord & build up his kingdom with it. I suppose many of the Brethren & Sisters are much tryed to think they cannot have all they want. I will tell you what to do, do all you can to day & let the rest go untill to morrow do your duty to day and all will be right what good would it do you to have 999 years to search & hear the revelations & commandments of God if we have no time to carry one of them out. If any one wants to get more revelations than they improve upon they are greedy dogs. It will take 20 years to do the work that God has revealed through the mouth of his servant Joseph which he laid out for us to perform before his death even during the last year of his life to say nothing of what he gave before. I will tell you your duty. Command your mindsfrom evry thing that is not for you to day & sit & worship God not sit & sleep but worship the Lord today, go home at the close of the meeting & get your food & rest then come to meeting againponder & reflect upon the cause of the Lord Jesus Christ & his sufferi-ngs. if their is any thing necessary to be done do it if an ox or an ass falls into the pit pull him out, drive any beast out of your Neighbors grain & put up the fence. Do you meditate do you pray in your families & in secret to get the spirit of God. you say youhave my ^your^ tryials I have mine I will tell some of them Brethren will come here to meeting on Monday morning go through my field leave my fence down let their cattle & horses eat my wheat 
 Borrow my cart waggon, shovel, hoe, ax & evry thing I havegot & that to without liberty & never bring it home and if it was not my duty to stay here I would lay my hands upon some I could pick out who I have confidence in &would go & form a colony by myself & would not admitof any person who was not proven I cannot get grass in theBig field but many of you do it. But I now warn you not to steal my wood nor any of my property for if you continue to do it I will put a mark upon such men that they willcarry all the days of their lives they are hypocritts and think all others are the same I dont love them vary wellAgain I say to you it is not your duty to get in debt to theseMerchants I say you shall pay your debts if you say you cantpay I say you shall pay them.I speak of the faults of my Brethren you may ask shall we forgive our Brother his trespasif he repents I say yes "How many times untill seventy times sevenin one day if he repents & asks for it even all sins exceptthe sin agains[t] the Holy Ghost. If you will bring back my toolsgrass & grain which you have taken unlawfully or any of my propertyand ask forgiveness I will return forgive you I will not castof[f] any man untill he cast himself off I will not reject any man untill he rejects himself, I will hold on to any man as longas he has any prospect of salvation.June 9, 1851 ~ Monday to June 14, 1851 ~ Saturday9th 10th 11th 12 13th & 14 This week has been spent in hunting lostcattle, wattering wheat & common labourJune 15, 1851 ~ Sunday15th Sunday President Brigham Young addressed the congrega-tion of the Saints in the following words.I would like to say enough in few words to fill three sermonsI have had to deliver my discourses in few words. I wish thepeople to sustain the priesthood as the priesthood. As to the opin-ion of men concerning myself as a man I care no more aboutit than I do the dust under my feet. I dont care what you say about me If you will ownly serve the Lord our God do the peoplelive so as to know the voice of the Good shepherd. I wish to stateone item here which concerns you seriously, that is concerningthe Indians here. They are Ignorant have been taught to steel & kill from their childhood & those who could do the most of it wereconsiderd the greatest Braves & chiefs as soon as they begin to steal here many of you want them killed compare their circumstances with your own. You are taught from your cradles not tosteal or kill as it is a great crime now do you kill a white manas soon as he steals weigh this subject well. Those who wishthem killed for stealing a horse reduce themselves far below theIndian. You love them as well as I do, but when the curseis taken off they will again be fit for society but while they are in their degraded state it rests upon us to use wisdom & judgment in their behalf. I say to the saints kill evry white man you see stealing & not kill the Indian for it for the white men know better. I speak to the saints not as the Govornor of Utah but you& I are sent to save Israel not to kill them. Evry Elder that crosesa certain line I do not wish to see him but those who do right orseek to do right if they commit an error we will forgive themI do not ask for influence ownly what God gives me neither willI give any man influence ownly what the Lord & his own good 
 conduct gives him for if God does not give a man influenceall els will be of no use to him. If I do the work of God i all is well but I will give no man influence ownly what God givesA Few words to families who have not a head to Governwill be destroyed. The man is the head of the family & shouldgovern it. the hand may say to the head if I really thought youwould govern right I would be governed by you but I am afraidyou will not and I want to govern you & dictate the head then theshoulders & stomach will want to dictate but does not good sens teachyou that your head should Govern your body your experience teachesthe same. Your head dictates you what to do & when your head dictates the body to do wickedly & pollute the body then the headshould be cut off so as not to pollute the body any longerG A Smith remarked that there was some bodies who could notact unless the belly told the head what to do. In the strict sens ofthe word no man is qualifyed to be jud[g]e & rule in the priesthood untill he is qualifyed to rule himself, & be king over himselfit is thus in families children & mothers Have you a goodHusband & Father let the wife rule the Husband & she will keephim tied to the dish cloth & kitchen all the days of his life & itproves a curse upon him. Their is a curse upon man that I would not take off if I could for in the experience youhave you are led to salvation through our Lord Jesus ChristDo you know your calling Mothers It is your duty to brace upyour feelings as men have to do & be mystress of your houseI go to the house to rest the Mother sayes I cannot govern thechildren I wish you would but this is not right the Eldersof this church have to go abroad to preach the gospel theycannot be with their children when they come home tospend a little time they want to daudle their children upontheir knee & not go to whiping them the Mother should go[vern]them wuntill the sons go with their Fathers in the field thenlet the Father Govern I can govern my children when they are with me I would rather one of my sons wouldstab me to the heart & kill me dead than to conquer & master me in government when any undertake to govern out of their place they do not prosper. As an ensampleP P Pratt & John Taylor undertook to govern & controll &set right my affairs at winter Quarters while I was on a pioneer Journey to the Mountains & they liked to have destroyed many but I said peace be still and I saved the peopleI say to Mothers in the Name of the Lord God of Israel do your duty dont ask the Father to whip the child do it yourself if necessary & let Mothers controll their daughters untill they goto their Husbands, but let the Man rule & preside over his householdand I say to the Men do not go home & abuse your wives becausof what I have said but treat them kindly what wouldyou think of a man who would get up before a glass &cut & tear his own heart out as well of him as I would of a man who would beat & abuse his wife. President Richards remarked Evry man makes his own Hell or Heavenif we keep the commandments & do right we have a Heaven withinus all the time 40 Men & all the devils in Hell cannot make a Hell for us if[we] do right but if you stop to parley with the devil he will soon get the advantageover you & make a Hell for you 
 [FIGURE] During the evening we met for prayer after which the president taught us much to our edifycation. The spirit should controll thebody the monitor whispers to the mind of man when it does [wrog] wrong& sayes this is wrong points out the right path & sayes walk ye in itthe soul or spirit of man wants feeding as well as the body or it will dry up & wither like the quakers & other sectsA Mormon boy will whip out the priest we will advance untill wecan stand in the society of the gods, then let us do right & keep thecommandments of God in all things. Our knowledge comes by experi[ence]it is Necessary that we should have crosses & trials of all kinds in order to gain knowledge by experience if we overcome we get a great victory continue to do so untill we arive at our high stations to become Gods Organize worlds & controle them. Allour passions God gave us but we must controll them & make aright use of them. Our spirits were pure from Eternity but condescended to take a body in its impure state was married to it will continue with it through time in mortality through Eternity in Immortality. In speaking of the married statesayes if man & wife become alliniated from each other it isin one sens the spirit of adulteryJune 16, 1851 ~ Monday to June 21, 1851 ~ Saturday16th 17, 18, 19, 20 & 21, this week was spent hunting lostcattle & at hard labourJune 22, 1851 ~ Sunday22nd Sunday President Young addressed the saints as follows. If I can see the motives of the heart of man & know Eternal things by the spirit of God it is far more beautiful than to hear their words of men. should an Angel come& convers with any man in the congregation No other one mightknow it. He would think the person spoke to him as one speaks toanother face to face when he would not be seen at all ownly bythe spirit of God or by vision. we may know by the spirit ofGod what is in a mans heart before he speaks, at all times listen to the still small voice of the spirit of God and it will save the saintsfrom many snares. If you get angry dont sin nor let the sungo down upon your wrath I do not expect perfection in men not what the world calls perfection I have seen a perfect prophetand perfect Apostles, that is perfect in their calling. But not theperfection the world looks for. If Joseph had been as perfect asthe people wished him to be he could not have lived with the peoplenor stayed this side of the veil as long as he did, we co[u]ld not haveherd his voice nor seen his face. He would have had to been veiledIsrael could not endure the face of Moses at times. The Lord exp-ects us to be in the path of Duty when we get in Eternity weshall be Angels or Goods we shall their advance to the God head if we do right.In speaking of the Law what a simple thing it iswhat is the Law to those who do right. It is not made for anybody but the transgresser & lawless & wicked. If we do not infringeupon the rights of others all things are ours in Heaven & Earth time& Eternity Life & Death Heaven Earth & Hell & all that is thereinis ours if we do not infringe upon the rights of any other beingwe shall become Gods & fill immensity as our Father in Heavendoes I can weigh all the sleepers philosophers, & Learned menof the Earth in the scale & know just what they weigh & can circumscribe them all. All is mine Heaven Earth, Hell wives children 
 and I am Christs & Christ is Gods. It is not known to us wharethe stakes are set to Gods immensity. Take the world at large andthey get to the end of their chain when they get to the mill pond. It is a startling Idea to think we are worshiping a God that once was once in the situation that we are in ourselvesthey had to pass through a probation of pain, suffering & the falllike ourselves & He made perfect through sufferings. The Son ofGod passed through it & the Father would not require of a son what He would not do Himself. All our sufferings will exhaltus in the presence of God if we endure them patiently. A word ofadvice concerning lawing I dont never want to hear of anotherlaw suit among the Brethren. Is it anything but good commonsense to Never have another suit before a jud[g]e to say nothingof revelation. It does not require any great perfection to accomplish this, let men do right do your Neighbour good notevil. The Lord will burn up the Earth to cleanse it as you wouldan old pipe. You think it hard to have to water your land herebut it is far more healthy than to have rain it was so in Egypt ifit did not rain in Illinois & Missouri more than here it wouldbe far more healthy this could be reasoned out on Natural principles. A word more upon Law suits their would not be a Lawsuitin this valley if all men would do right & were saints but the net hasgathered all kinds good bad & worse let twelve men get drunkin this community & it ruins the place in the estimation ofof good men we have to bear the character of the drunkarda few stinking fish in the net defile it. & the whole net stinksand it creates a prejudic against it. Those who were acq-uainted with Joseph know that if he delt any in temporal things it created a prejudice against him. He bought manygoods to help carry on the public works but the people were readyto get it all away from him. So it is now but I say unto all men who are saints put to your hands & help build up Zion& the Kingdom of God we are scholars in the great school & must learn we are a kingdom & must bring the kingdom in subje[c]tionto the will of GodJune 23, 1851 ~ Monday to June 28, 1851 ~ Saturday23rd 24th 25, 26, 27 ^& 28^ This week was spent in prepareing to buildJune 29, 1851 ~ Sunday289th Sunday President Young remarked I Join in testimony with the Brethren I wish to be a doer of the word I feel the importance of the remarks of the last speaker Brother Spencer thosewho are not ready to meet the Bridegroom will not be invited to the supper and the time is near. Jesus Christ is an ensam-ple to all Saints, He was filled with wisdom in his youth but inhis childhood & infancy He was like other children. It has been said that He was in infancy wise as in manhood but thisis not the case He was subject to temptation as we are but wasnot overcome by it. If we have become acquainted with our follieslet us put them away & apply our hearts unto wisdom. let us have compassion on others as we wish God to have compassion on us we should increase in wisdom untill the day of redemptionNo person can receive all at once but increase little by little untillthe day of perfection. Apply our hearts to wisdom & it will producepeace, health, wealth & evry good thing. should you see a peoplecarry out the principles of wisdom peace would be the fruit & 
 you would never see contention unto the day of your deathAsk the world if they do not like a people who live in peace & are contented & they will say yes it is beautiful take the world at the present time & they are like wolves eat each other up they fight & contend & devour each other the abolitionest become heated & say the Negro must be made equal to the white man at the table &all other places they will at the same time turn away the widow & orphan & put into prision a poor man for debt, and deprive himof his time to pay the debt, instead of this we should feed the hungry & do good to all men as we have an opportunity then we have a Zion it is peace in the heart we should bear an evil from a Friend as well as an Enemy you ask the Lord to bear with your infirmities so we should bear with each other. what is the necessity of doing wrong having lawsuits & contending with each other go to Law & spend $100 tocollect $5. you may be told you are independent & have rights you have a right to do good & not evil. The God I serve will deal out good to his saints & evry thing that is necessary for them & reveal his will unto them, & teach them what to do He will not lie or decieve me I will ask O Lord did you do this or that did you bless this man or that man so & so or did you suffer that evil to be so & so yes I have done this to try men so & so, do you want me to do so & so. If I am going to do a thing I ask is it the will of God if I cannot get the will of God upon it I refuse todo it lest I do a thing wrong, we want to do right then we prosper. is the people doing right is the kingdom growingis their principles in this kingdom to govern all men with All that the Nations of the Earth Now possess would not make this people happy as they now are. Give us the kingdom of God instead of the glories of the world. their has been a great stir to exhalt the Negro & make him equal to the white man but there is a curse upon the seed of Cain & all Hell cannot wipe it out & it cannot be taken off untill God takes if off when a person unlawfully seeks for power & exhaltation by taking the blessings which belongs to another he will sink far below the other. As Lucipher the son of the morningsought the glory that belonged to Christ the first born He was thrust down to Hell. so Cain sought Abels blessi-ng & took the life of his brother the consequence was Cain was cursed & his seed & this curse will remain untill Abels posterity will get all the blessing their is for him then the curse may be taken from Cain or his posterity but his posterity will be below Abels. Allare slaves Polititions are the worst slaves and if we dontdo right we shall ketch the lash we are the freest people on Earth. Queen Victoria is a slave had to ask the liberty to marry prince Albert but we are free we have the right God & kingdom let isus not dishonor God His kingdom or our Brethren if we do we shall sink below them & their children. If the wife dishonors the Husband the childrenwill dishonor the Mother & she must welter under it Honour the priesthood in all its parts. Be more faithful be more prudent. Administer to the wants of all as far as you can I will not quarrel with my neighbor about the water 
 if I loose the wheel for if my Neighbors raises wheat I can obtain some of it to eat. Other remarks were maid bythe speakerJuly 1, 1851 ~ TuesdayJuly 1st I commenced laying adobies in my house this dayJuly 2, 1851 ~ Wednesday to July 3, 1851 ~ Thursday2 & 3 We continued building the houseJuly 4, 1851 ~ FridayJuly 4th In celebration of the Independance of America the City of the great Salt Lake poured forth her inhabitants who went forth in good order with her Legion of mighty men As an Escort to the Govornor & citizens of the state. The company organized at the Temple square & started at 9 oclok in the morning to take a ride to the great Salt Lake their was about 140 carriages of waggons besides the Horsemen the car containing the Band of Musicions was drawn by 16 mules we arived at the rock on the Lake at 2 oclock A.M [p.m.] we had a meeting was addressed by Govornor Young & several Orators who spoke much to the edifycation of the people in the evening many went into the salt lake to bathe at 10 oclkthe signal was given for prayers when all assembled in the carrell or circle and prayer was offered up before God & the encampment retired to rest we were 24 miles from the cityJuly 5, 1851 ~ Saturday5th At 10 oclok AM all the teams were hitched up & we returned to the City of the Great Salt Lake in the same Order that we came out. It was as plesant a forth of July as I ever spent my own family & Sister Foss & her family went out together in a large family waggon drawn by 4 HorsesJuly 6, 1851 ~ SundaySunday 6th President Young remarked we get good from all men who speak by the spirit of God & according to their calling I speak free so may all men. If we speak incorrect we should be corrected we want to speak free that we may gather good whether it is in the past present or to come Brother Kempton has been speaking. He professes to be a scholar I do not, but he has murdered the English language today I want speakers to speak the English language correctly for our children sake. As to principles their is no principles in Heaven Earth or Hell but what the Saints have to appley to their proper place. If we could understand all things weshould know that here is the place to begin to make the people happyif we could understand the dealings & providences of God with us & the object of it their would not be the discontent & murmerings of the people that their now is but we should have peace Joy & contentment. Concerning spiritual & temporal things I would say that temporal & spiritual things are one but what we call temporal are the courser things which we see with our Eyes but the finer or spiritual things we cannot see with our Eyes unless they are touched by the spirit of God. Then we could see spiritual thingsto say the spiritual eye cannot see temporal things is follybut it looks unnatural to see people put out their own eyes to spite their Neighbor. Anciently God Angels & Eternal things 
 were considered Natural my mind can see many things whenclothed with the spirit of God that my Eyes cannot. Inspeaking of Hell it is called vary hot but our God isa consumeing fire. Hell is here it is said the devil was cast down to the Earth also that he was cast down to HellHe is in our midst striveing to lead captive the childrenof men I want the Brethren to speak freely to speakall that is in you & if you have an Error let it out& exchange it for true principle. some of the Saints want more Revelation mysteries, great things, but do they know what they ask for or what they have already got if the request of many men was granted it would be like casting pearles before swine they wouldtrample them in the mire we have enough now of the key words &tokens to take us through the veil into the celestial world & lead us to theThrone of God, & what more do you want. Have you ever pondered in your hearts by visions & the spirit of God Eternal things even the redeeming ofall worlds from there down to the smallest things God has made Have you ever reflected upon the great system of salvation of the creatures of God Is man contented He is not. Can man alter the decrees ofGod concerning the seed of Abraham or any thing els He cannotwhy not quarrel about Christ coming instead of the Fatherwhen the Father appointed Jesus Christ the first born to come & redeem the Earth there was contention got up the second brotherLucipher the son of the morning He wanted the honour to come & redeem the Earth but Christ was the Appointed one it was his right by appointment & birthright. But the war & contention became so hot & the influence of Lucipher was so great that he got one third of the hostsof Heaven to Join his standard & when he was hurled down to Helllike lightning from Heaven one third was cast down with him whareis he & those that were cast down, with those spirts that accompaniedhim they are here on this Earth and they have blinded the children of men & still seeking to overthrow the kingdom of GodHe is a thorn in the flesh to the children of God but this is all right& we should be contented with what God sees fit to grant unto us & tocontented with our lot. If the devil had been contented & acted in his place he would not have been thrust down to Hell. Any man whoseeks to do a thing that he cannot do & should not do it cast him into Hell & makes a Hell for him when men ask for things that does not belong to him & it makes him unhappy. But do what God wants you to do & wait on those who are above you & all will be right. why did not one of the Apostles quarrel with Jesus Christ to redeem the world Jesus set a little child in their midst & said if ye do not become as this little child you cannot enter into the kingdom of God. If you would be the greatest man in the kingdom of God you must be the greatest slave or servant you will do more than any other man. The Apostles did not quarrel to know who should or should not be presidentwhy do I or you not quarrel because we were not Joseph Smithto want to & cannot is Hell. Never seek to do a thing you cannot accomplish. Evry man has his lot appointed him & he should be contented with it. Their is the work of God, Angels, men & Devils Is the Bible good the Book of Mormon Doctrins & Covenantsyes they are good those Book contain the words of God Angels men& Devils. And if you dont want to be in Hell all the time be contentedwith your lot if you dont learn to be contented you will be in Hell with Brother Kempton who sayes he was in Hell one year 
 then learn to be contented and you will be happy dont complain because you are not God, Jesus Christ, an Angel, Joseph, Brighama man, a woman a Father a Mother, a son a daughter or any thing els but be contented with the lot in which God hasplaced you then you will be happy & blessed. The Blacks cannot take the curse off themselves untill God takes it off make all men saints & they will treat each other well. So the Laman-ites are cursed but is there not blessings for them yes the same as their is for the Saints for Joseph Brigham & Jesus Christ& all Faithful men & women in their time & season so be contentedJuly 7, 1851 ~ Monday to July 12, 1851 ~ Saturday7th 8th  9th 10th 11 & 12 This week was spent in building my houseexcept Monday the 7th I spent in the council House with my Brethren labouring in the duties of my officeJuly 13, 1851 ~ Sunday13th Sunday met as usual at the Bowery. Elder Sherwood preachedin the forenoon a lengthy discourse which was edifying to the peopleIn the afternoon Elder Kimball Father Smith E D Woolley & President Young spoke. Among the Presidents remarks he saidwhy should we not know our own talents & abilities as well as others if we do not their is sumthing lacking. concerning singingtheire isare some men who know sound & others do not & those who do not know sound ought not to sing, we should act upon what we do know & let the rest go Sherwood said he thought we were kicked out of the fire into the frying panPresident Young said we were kicked out of the fire into the middle of the floor when this people get their eyesopen so as to see that their interest lies in building up of the kingdom of God then the kingdom of God will roll on and the people will do betterJuly 14, 1851 ~ Monday14th I spent the day in the council chambers with my Brethren I herd two interesting letters read from our Friend & Brother Col Kane of Philadelphia. Kinkade hada large train of goods arive to dayJuly 15, 1851 ~ Tuesday15 some of the government officers & their train arived to dayJuly 16, 1851 ~ Wednesday to July 19, 1851 ~ Saturday16, 17, 18 & 19 I spent the time building my houseBulah Augusta born this 19, July 1851July 20, 1851 ~ Sunday20th Brother Kempton was vary anxious to preached from text Abrams bosom liberty was granted him and he went ahead but did not do much President Young followed & said Brother Kempton has had his libertyas is given to evry man who speaks here he has not satisfyedhis mind at all he may have much in his mind but can say but little here. He is not able to handle the scriptures & knowall the spirits in the world as some can when the dark sayingsin the scriptures are understood they are plain. The scripturehere that speaks of Abrams bosom is not as given by Br Kempton Abram is in paradise Lazarus is with him [##Luke 16:20-25##]for me to explain is to tell the truth a man that feels & talks to the people should be a Bible of himsel if a man that 
 teaches & leads the people is not filled with truth so as to be able to teach the people without quoting the teachings of others altogether isa blind guide & will go to Hell with those he leads. It is the intenti-on of the Lord to teach men principle in progression untill he shall know all things, that he may arise through faith power& victory untill they obtain evry good thing even to arise to be Gods even the Sons of God which blessing we cannotobtain without experience we should not sin when we are tryed & tempted but overcome which will give us glory honor & eternal life as fast as I improve upon what I havemore will be given me. The Saviour was subject to all that we were from his birth to his death. He applyed his heart unto wisdomwe should do so to apply our hearts unto wisdom from day to day and you will receive all that He did. If I through out all that is in me what faults I have will give place for truth & that is good I feel to praise the Name of God for all He has done for me. My heart is like Aminidab continuallyall persons see times when they wish truth to prevail. Mormonismis all theruth the Lord has raised up a Prophet & Seer who broughtit forth & esstablished it. He was faithful unto death & sealed his testimony with his blood. A certain prophecy sayes when the Book of Mormon shall come unto the gentile the Jews shall be gathered at Jerrusalem. All truth is ours in Heaven Earth& Hell it is all the truth we want. But does the church or Elders want correcting yes for they have errors & fals botions the net has all kinds of fish we have some as cursed rascals among us as dwell on the Earth and we find Evil here as well as any whare els. Yet Zion is here it is in my heart peace dwells with me & good principles will prevail Here untill all evilis overcome even in all the Earth let no man find fault with his Neighbor untill He is righteous I dont ask any thing ofothers that I wont do myself and never find fault with another about any thing you allow in yourself dont yousware, scold, & do wrong yourself then dont find faultwith another for it untill you subdue your own passions & the Evil that is in yourself some will do any thingto preside over another when they cannot preside over themselves. Now remember this that we will have Zion when all wickedness is gone. we have got to fight fightfight untill we gain the victory over ourselves. Remember this & overcome what is the feelings of my heart it is to blessthe people & do them goodJuly 21, 1851 ~ Monday to July 23, 1851 ~ Wednesday21, 22 & 23rd spent the time on my houseJuly 24, 1851 ~ ThursdayJULY 24th  [FIGURE] This is an important day with the saints of God in thes vallies of the mountains The following is an extract from the Deseret News"The celebration of the 24 of July" The Anniversary of the enter-ance of the Latter Day Saints Pioneers into the valley of the GreatSalt Lake. The approach of the rising king of Day was hailed by the roar of cannon & the stillness of the morning was broaken by the moveing of the mammoth carriage of the Nauvoo Brass Band sending forth on the wings of the morning its sublime straines of martial & cheering music & the citizens of Great Salt Lake 
 shot forth from their domestic circles dressed as in the robes of beauty concentrating towards the scene of a congregated throng of life whare the ebullitions of Joy the rose of Health the glanessof intelligence & the combined feelings of an united & redeemed people shed a lustre of glory through all the congregated Saints"The order of the day was kept up by the fireing of cannon 110 times the organization & parading of streets by an escort consisting of the Nauvoo Brass band the Military Band the Pioneers of47 the Regency, the aged Fathers, young lads, followed by the Mothers in Israel young girls, young men & young women the Presidency with the officers of State formed the escortedparty in their rear were 24 Bishops forming a phalanx of the combined wisdom & strength of the Kingdom of God in the lastdays the numerous flags & banners the various emblems of art agriculture, & industry & the music accompanying the procession fromthe presidence residence to the Bowery could ownly be surpassed in the Armies of heavenThe bursts of feelings by music, singing, speeches, orations, toaststhe order of arangement during the exercises in the Bowery was beyond the most exquisite calculation of the most fastidious & was unsur-passed by any preceding it among the most refined & civilized nation on Earth. Here was the power of truth the literature of Gods spirit, the Eloquence of Apostles, the laws of the kingdom of Heaven, the songs of Zion sung not in a strange land & the harps hung not upon the willows the beauty & ornament of the beau ideal of mans existence the ladies of Deseret the Heroism of the valiant of the Earth & the Enjoyment of the luxuries and productions of a consecrated land in all its richness & profusion & the enjoyment of contentmentThe closing shades of evening came over the city without the alloy of any accident to mar the procedings of the hallowed dayno curses of a drinking rabble no feelings of an ignorant or Jealous bigotry, no effusion of party strife but all that could elevate the mind of man & add to the enjoyment of a social& civilized.Among the speeches made was an interesting onefrom W W. PhelpsIn many respects this was the most interesting day of my life. My Father, myself, & my children making three generations in the linage of my Fathers was in that Grand Escort to Honor the Holy Prophets of God while on their march from President Youngs House to the Tabernacle which was filled with the Saints of the Most HighJuly 25, 1851 ~ Friday to July 26, 1851 ~ Saturday25 & 26 I spent the time about my dwellingJuly 27, 1851 ~ Sunday27th Sunday I attended meeting we had a good day. Brother Kimball addressed the meeting a part of the day among other remarksHe said Jesus Christ was the first Born of the Father & He was the candidate & elected to redeem the world. Lucipher setup as a candidate to run against Jesus Christ but He was overcome & thrust down to Hell with all that followed him and we will haveno more division henceforth & forever in Israel we will have but one candidate for office but No opposition. All will be elected & proven. If a person is qualifyed to fill a greater station than he holds 
 He will have a chance. The Presidency & Twelve will fill in Eternity those stations appointed them so with all men but I expect to remain on this Earth untill I am able to create a world of my own & people it the lord has given us rich portions of the Earthto inherit we have been driven from tim to time from therewe now inherit a goodly land the best land on the Earth forvegitation & it will be good for fruit & the people of the Earthwill yet come to us for fruitJuly 28, 1851 ~ Monday to July 31, 1851 ~ Thursday28, 29, 30, 31 I spent in my Harvest fieldAugust 1, 1851 ~ Friday to August 2, 1851 ~ SaturdayAug 1st & 2nd I spent harvesting I had 20 acres of wheat 5 acres of 7 headed wheat was vary stout supposed to yield 60 or 70 bushelsto the acres I had 10 acres of touse & 5 acres of clubAugust 3, 1851 ~ Sunday3rd Sunday I attended meeting Dr Bernhisel accupyed the time in the forenoon giving an account of his procedings in washingtonalso his obtaining a library for DeserettAugust 4, 1851 ~ Monday to August 9, 1851 ~ Saturday4, 5, 6, 7, 8, & 9 I spent this week harvesting & going to DrRichards kanyon which was a horrid roadAugust 10, 1851 ~ Sunday10th Sunday I attended meeting Brother Babbit attended meeting & addressed the assembly in the forenoon mostly upon the gospel & priesthoodAugust 11, 1851 ~ Monday to August 16, 1851 ~ Saturday11, 12 & 13 ^14 15 & 16^ I spent the time mowing & harvestingAugust 17, 1851 ~ Sunday to August 20, 1851 ~ Wednesday14 15 16 17 17 Sunday I was unwell & was at home 18 19 & 20 I labouredAugust 21, 1851 ~ Thursday to August 23, 1851 ~ Saturday[FIGURE] 214 225 & 263 I spent the time in council with some 40 or 50 men and they were some of the best days of my life muchgood was done light truth & the power of God was manifestdifficulties of long standing bet[w]een men were settelled the powerof God was upon president Young who is made by the power of God a great good & glorious man & a Father indeed to thechurch & kingdom of GodAugust 24, 1851 ~ Sunday24th Sunday Elder O Hyde addressed the meeting & said the floods in the western states had been exceding highso much so that many could not emigrate there were about 700 waggons on the way. The spirit of emigrationwas among all Nations the seas were white with the sails of evry Nation who were emigrating to this country to find a home many might embrace the Gospel & cometo Zion & help builb it up. The feelings of the saints are if I can get to the valley then I shall be happythen some want to go to Sanpete to Iron county && to Sandiego then they would not be satisfyed & peoplewish to emigrate to another world & think when theyget to Heaven their sorrow will end but their will be things for us to reach after still when we are there &it will continue through all Eternity. Their is many Novelswritten & painted out but we do not want fals things to interest us. But Just look into the Book of Nature & evrything whether it looks up or down points to God. God is seen in it all. Evry substance is surrounded with an atmosphere& in some respects shows what is within 
 so their is an atmosphere surrounds all persons which you feel when you meet with them, some persons atmosphere you light like others you do not with some you feel safe other you do notit is so in meeting with families. Jesus said when you gointo a house let your peeace dwell upon it but if they do notreceive you let your peacece return unto you again. This is truedoctrin (let my atmosphere be good so that the spirit of God & good men may dwell with me in peace for that person who dwellsnear the Lord & has an Eye single to his glory can tell whether he has the spirit of God or not when he meets with him manybodies are opake & not luminous but when the light of a luminous body strikes them it sets them all in a blaze so with one who has the spirit of God when his spirit rests upon anotherit overshadows him it sets him in a blaze & the great lightcan see the Heart. We are all as it were painters painting ourown characters and evry good deed will give our sign a white coulor & evry wicked deed a black colour & when wehave painted unto the End of our days our character will be presented before God in its true light & we shall see as we areseen & know as we are known some think the Judgmentwill not be untill after the resurrection of some thousandsof years but remember that when you lie down at night & areweary and fall asleep before you are aware of it the morningcomes the time is past & you are awoke. But in the church &kingdom of God what is sealed on Earth is sealed in Heaven whatis bound on Earth is bound in Heaven and if a man sinshe is soon brought into Judgment for now is the Judgment with him. God will Judge the world but He may not Judge oneindividual Himself but His servants will Judge them under his direction. It is said the saints will Judge Angels but whatAngels why fallen Angels for those Angels who remain inHeaven are now above us while those who are fallen are belowus for who is better able to Judge them than the Saints who cast them out. Many other interesting remarks were made byElder Hyde.Elder H. C. Kimball arose & said the remarks of Elder Hyde weregood and I will apply them and I want all to lift up their sign and I want to imitate the best painted sign in Israel & the character that is most like God I never expect to see atime in all Eternity but what I shall have to abide a law be trimmed & scourged untill I am a fit subject to become a God. If you get into Heaven & rebell you will be cast outtheir is always danger of falling as long as we are going up a ladder.August 25, 1851 ~ Monday[FIGURE] Aug 25th [FIGURE] I spent the day in council with myBrethren & while in the council the mail arived from the States in 20 days from Independance the largest ever recieved about 400 lbs I received 3 letters one from Azmon one from Thompson & one from Ilus.

On my arival home with my letters I called My aged Father into the Room with me & red him the letters from his two oldest sons containing an account of the death of both his own wife & his sons wife he was quite resigned to the providence of God in these thingsAugust 26, 1851 ~ Tuesday to August 29, 1851 ~ Friday26, 27, 28, 29, I spent a part of the time in council & apart of it in the Harvest field Brother G A Smith arived home from Iron County on the 28th in good healthAugust 30, 1851 ~ Saturday30th I was in council with the Elders & herd a long letter red from Lorenzo SnowAugust 31, 1851 ~ Sunday31 Sunday Elder G.

Young H. C. Kimball & W. Richards of the Quorum of the Twelve O. Hyde W. Woodruff G. A. Smith & E. T. Benson. The first seven presidents of the Seventieswith the other Quoroms & a large congregation of SaintsPresident H. C. Kimball arose & said the conference was not for the benefit of one but for the whole. Is the store Housefull of wheat is the tithing butter & cheese brought in. some of you will ask can I get my Endowment but I will say not one of you will get your endowments untill you pay your tithing Prayer by O Hyde then singing. 
 President Young arose and said as far as you can exercise patience you should do so, we are oin comfortable circumstances & now let us sit here & worship God & let our business rest & let us reflet a little & exercise ourselves in our religion let our houses rest & farms & crops let the people be still & not talk in the house or about the window. In my meditations I am like other men who refletand I marvel to see men so intent upon objects that will so soon perish. How many their are here who ask the question how long will this Conference last I want to go I cannot stop and others will be willing to stop & worship God some spirits are like the troubled sea uneasy. If I could have my wish about it I would wish such spirits to pass out of our midst leave the congregation & let us worship in peace. We are such an industrious people that we could not commence conference untill Sunday. I care as little about our gardens farms lumber &c as you do about snuffing ashes. If you get all the riches of the world you cannot Hold them. If you will get the wisdom it is your privilege to possess you will know that God cares more for you than the ravens if you seek the Kingdom of God & its righteousness the Lord will add all things els that is necessary. Our first duty is to provide for our families but we must take a course to accomplish it. Fools are often rich & the wise in begery this is the providence of God we may be ever so rich to day we maybe beggars to morrow thise is the case with those who are before me let me draw the line between the Good & Evil Have you not hadmore good than Evil more than you would had if you had been in the world more peace than in the world & happiness than in the meditati[on] of the things of God than in the world yes you have then shame on the man who complains of his hardship the worst persecutions of the people are their best days. I went to Mo in 1834 walked 2000 miles in 70 days was so weak I could not step over the fence 3 feet high. I now have better health & strength than ever before I would not give allGeauga County for the experience I have had in 6 months. Now stay here dont go home untill conference Ends. Many of the Saints forget mormonism any body who Enjoy the light of the revelations of Jesus Christ must have the spirit of God the [FIGURE] key to mormonism is all the truths their is all Eternity that was ever revealed orever will be that exhists with God Angels or men. whare shall I go to Find truth in Mormonism. If you get a truth any whare it is there as that covers all truth when the light came to me sin did not revive in me and I died but I revived & lived I had not consented to the death of any good man like Stephenas Paul did. But let him come to any of the Churches reared in honour to his name & the world would kill him if they could I will ask you are you excepted [accepted] of the Father & Son you willsay I dont know, well it is because your minds are taken up withthe things of the world then let us stay here untill we do know I am a Mormon or what is called so and I know that Joseph was a prophet. It was revealed to me long before his death I always thought while reading the Bible about a prophet that I would go around the world to see one or any man who knew thingsas they were & not have to guess at them. Evry thing will have to bow to Mormonism or Eternal light & truth we have the true government of all the Earth I know the path this people has to walk 
 I am prepared for Mormonism there was no better man than Joseph Smith ever lived on the Earth. Hear it O ye Heavens O ye Earth and all men this is my testimony that he is theas good aman as ever lived save Jesus. The world will not vote for a man because his religion governs they will not have God govern them because of their cursed meanness but if God did notor can not dealedout Justice & rule in righteousness who canE T Benson spoke to edifycation said some bore record of the thingsof God as they were revealed to them others believe on their testimony the servants of God bind & seal on Earth & it is bound & sealedin Heaven I bear testimony that we have a prophet that will hold the keys of the kingdom of God through all Eternity also aPatriarch both have sealed their testimony with their blood for the cause & kingdom of God Mormonism is true & the keys ofthe kingdom of God are with you the presidency of the church who now live with us and are righteous men the Twelve, High priest, High Council, Seventies & Elders of Israel are righteous men Joseph said we went into the little End of the Horn & came out of the big End of the Horn. Any thing is ours if we are faithful &do the will of the Lord.O Hyde took the floor and said this is one of the happiest periods of my life. The testimony of all is good if the Brethren who have spoken have broaken a clean loaf still I may gather few crumbs we are living in the most important age and when the Greatest events are to take place evry thing is on the move the testimony of this work will go through the Earth and the Lord will arise out of His hiding place and reign King of Nations as He does now king of Saints, this would destroyall the Governments of the Earth. Do the Latter day Saints wish the Nations of the Earth any Evil No we would save them all if we could. But it was a mercy anciently to cut off the wicked from the Earth that their posterity should not inherit the Earth to follow the wickedness of their fathers Gog & Magog will ere long gather to fight against the Saints of the Lamb of God and when hope is almost fled Christ will comeand End the scenery. If a prophet has been schooled in the society of the Gods to come to the Earth as a prophet to do a work for the kingdom he has the power of God with himto help him do it the same as we ordain a man to build up a county whare we cannot go so when a prophet comes he comes holding the keys of the kingdom of God & binds & seals on Earth that which is bound & sealed in HeavenG A Smith arose and said if I did not know the truthI should not have taken the pains I have to preach it to the worldand act the part I have in it but I know that God has sent a Prophet to us and ordained a Priesthood & set up his kingdom on Earth and a religion that is not evry thing is nothingJesus broke bread & said Eat in rememberance of me and this do untill I come and always remember me when Joseph was murdered the piety of the people did not oppose his murder when they arise will it be with white robes No but with garments spotted with blood of the prophets. None on the Earth had sympathy but the Saints. I have been spending a time to build up a 
 stake in the wilderness. Why is it we have been driven to these vallies of the mountains is it not that we may be sheltered when the Judgments of God come on Babylon A man should not be so taken up with his farm as to Forgetthis work some will say I have done so much for this Churchthat I must now do sumthing for myself there is now many in Jackson Co who are waiting for the Saints to come there but they will not get the blessings those will who have come to the Salt Lake valley this is the best wayto Heaven. Some want to go to Calafornia to get rich Iwant men to go with me who want to go to meeting and get reproof & kiss the rod I had such men with me & we done well. I bear testimony that God is with this peopleW. Woodruff addressed the meeting & said he was much interested & edifyed in the testimony which had been bour[n] by the presidency & Twelve & those who had spoken President Young had borne testimony that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God He was well qualifyed to bear testimony of him He has been with him day & night in his public & private councils he knows his life and he has followed close in his footsteps He always loved him and [had] he have beenin Nauvoo at the time of his arest he would have stove the barn doors into kindling wood bwith his fist if he could not have liberated him any other way. their is sumthing interesting in the testimony of men the anci-ents were martered for the testimony which they held which they bore of Jesus Christ so men in this day are opposed for their testimony but I know JosephSmith was a prophet of God so is Brigham Young the mantle of Joseph rest upon him and he has power tolead this people and my soul is filled with Joy when he stands here & speaks the word of the Lord & brings forth the glorious things of the Kingdom of GodPresident Young said I read that when the wicked rule the people mourn. Ask the world do the wicked rule yes And they mourn do they seek a righteous man [to] rule No if the curse has followed the rule of the wicked it will follow but let them sleep on & take your rest but we understand the Lord has rent the veil sent Angelsto us and the gospel to preach to the poor the difference between us & the world is they say but do not nor believe not we say & both believe & do the world spend thousands of Dollars to preach the gospel but do not believe it when the Judgments of God rest upon the wicked & they are cut off then will be the [glory]of Grapes after the vintage is done. let the righteous reign & the righteous will rejoice in the House of Israel God takes up the Isles as a little thing builds up & pulls down at his pleasure and why are not the people willing He should reign Because of their meanness some may ask do notgood man reign. I will ask a question should an Angel come to President Fillmore & tell him how to govern 
 the Nation & he was to tell of it they would shut him up in a mad house and if God was to reveal to him truth concerning the people & he was to tell of it thepeople would kill him this is the situation of thisgovernment the best on Earth. But let the president sware & take the name of God in vaine & curse God all itsform [and] they would let him stay with them as Hail fellowswell met and the Nations will be damned & go to Hellwho killed Joseph the State of Ill in connexion with the Carthage Mob and the whole Government ofsustainedit & they will be damned from the President to the leastmember I think no more of a King or Presidentthan of the meanest ^poorest^ begger the worst scoundrelwould is the most popular man in the Nationthis Nation is the first the gospel was sent unto she has killed the prophets that God sent unto them & their doom will be the Neithermost HellW Richards says we have had much testimony to dayI will add a few words when Hiram Smith fell inCarthage Jail and exclaimed I am a dead man thenJoseph Smith fell dead John Taylor fell wounded I carriedhim to another part of the Jail covered him up I walkedout before the people & said that Joseph & Hiram Smithwho lay before me slain were two of the best men thatever lived Joseph Smith was a prophet of God & Hirama Patriarch two better men never lived two bettermen God never made. Joseph was a Prophet Brighamis as great a Prophet and he that believeth it may besaved & he that believeth it not will be damned.September 8, 1851 ~ MondayMonday Morning 8th Judge Brochus requested the privilege ofaddressing the people it was granted him he arose and commencedhis speach by testifying ^of^ his kind reception among this peopleHe had been sick among them & been kindly treated the flyieshad been brushed from his face by a Lady & he was thankful He refered to the Judiciary requested the people to sustain it& professed to be vary sorry that he was going to leaveit.

He said several stood by & wished to take upthe challenge given by the Judge but he would not permitof it for some might get their hair pulled if not theirthroats cut. And he would not have it He wished themeeting to adjourn & meet in the afternoon & transactbusiness in the capacity of a conference for which the meetingwas called Meeting adjourned one hourMet according to adjournment. After singing & prayer BrotherKempton addressed the meeting was followed By Broth Gifford.Br John Young next addressed the House & was followed by H. C. Kimball who said I will tell one thing that will have a great effect upon us will remove the mist when we come to the House of the Lord Bring an offering to the Lord Iwil make an Offering to the Lord & to the priesthood as Abramdid to Melchezedic & offer the best you have. did this lawcome from Joseph who was ordained under the hands ofPeter Brigham Young was ordained under the hands ofJoseph to hold the keys of the Kingdom of God if you strikeagainst him you strike against God who sent himThe Judges came here to Judge criminals not to Judge uswho keep the Law. He then sat down & we had a song fromthe welsh BrethrenPresident Young then arose & said I will speak of principleyou may think it is a Novel conference How long has it beensince we have had the privilege of spending a conferenceundeisturbed a long time I would like to hear BrotherKempton speak or any good man. I will preach Br Abbottfuneral sermon and the funeral sermon of all the faithfulHis body is laid in the dust to rest untill the resurrection foreverblessed is the man that lives & dies a Saint. I will tell whetherthe Messenger sent to Brother Kempton was of God or the DevilIf the Messenger sent was of God he would know it, if the messenger wasany whare els but here he must have come from Heaven or from 
 another Hell for we are in Hell go to the world & preach the gospelyou will find some people as honest & good as Angels as far as theyknow but do they have revelations from God & know the thingsof God No they do not. If Brother Kempton has had his sins forgiven & remitted without baptism so could all menbut this is false for no man could have forgiveness withoutthe sheding of blood & baptism the Bible says unless you keep thecommandments you cannot be saved when Br Kempton sayeshe knows his sins were forgiven before he was baptized he dont know what he sayes At times the spirit of God is givento men to see the kingdom of God and they think they are in it when they have not entered the door of baptism dontgo & call the different Denominations because their sins arenot forgiven them that they are always going to dwell in Hellfor if they aere honest they will have a glory greater than many who carry the Gospel to men their is as good peopleamong all sects Gentiles Jews & Heathen as their is on Earththey act according to the best light they have. what is the condem-nation of this Government, light has come into the world & men lovedarkness rather the light they reject that light fight the prophets & shed their blood for this they are damnedElder Sherwood arose & said that the priesthood had made JosephBrigham & all men what they were by the assistance of light & truthas far as we follow light & truth so far we shall appoxamate towards light & truth & God if God & Angels were made whatthey are by truth as far as we learn that truth & follows out the council of it so far he will be like God & when he leaves thattruth he goes into darkness & misery. If the United States were practi-zing truth they would be vary different from what they now arethe practice of right things make men rejoice the practice of Evilthings make sorrow we are agents to do right or wrong if a manfeels disposed to go to Hell he has a right to it is no mans businessHe goes on his own responsibility and agency so if he wishes toGo to Heaven he has a right to by keeping a Celestial law let medo my work to acceptance. we know many truths we cannot thinkoff [of].

Now it is ourduty to feed cloth & sustain the families of those who are inthe vineyard preaching if we let them suffer & they die theirblood will be required at our hands we as a people have never

D. Woolley addressed the meeting made many good remarkssaid we had a Joseph with us in the person of B. YoungB Young wished to say a few words to the Mormon Battalion those who are wanting their extra pay are applying to William, Blair & Babbit if you apply to these men & give them the papers & they cheat you out of it dont complan, & I say to those men not to take any papers from those who have had their pay or sold their claims to others. If you want your pay apply here, & you can get it. You did not enlist to get $8 pr month they enlisted us to kill us and because we speak our sentimets we are accused of treason I dont ask any odds of the U.S. I will express my feelings to drive us from our Millions & possessions than require us to fight their battles is not right.I shall pay my tithing. The Twelve will pay one 10th of their possess[ions] & the Bishops and all will pay their tithing. This is the kingdom of God & if it falls I am willing to fall with it. I had rather fall than stand if the Priesthood falls. All covenanted to pay their tithing one tenth of all they possessBishop Hunter spok upon the tithing would begin with himself & wished all the Bishops to do the sameLorenzo Young spoke upon the TithingPresident Youg said he wished all the people to pay their tithing to the Bishops of their ward. He refered to the remarks made by Father Smith on the word of wisdom. He said $50000 dollars had been spent in the valley during the past year for needless things for Coffee tea Tobaco &c many others remaks were madBy president Youg "Elder Banks spoke upon the law of libertyPresident Youg followed in reply & said the liberty of the Holy Gospel was peace & righteousness we had no liberty to take away another mans rights but the first principle of liberty was resignation & submission for go whare you will to Heaven or Hell you have to submit to laws we are at liberty to adobt evry Holy principle to allEternity go East North or South keep evry thing you want for yourself wife children houses cattle & create out of the elements evry thing you can yet you are not at liberty to infringe upon the rights of men you may have the privilege to do all things that is done in heaven. Organize the elements give commands & rule over kingdoms but be subject to such laws as you are under the law of liberty is to do right for God to all Eternity the opposite principle is to be discontented with things to be different from what they are this is Hell & all the Hell their is I dont care how things are if I do right we shall find the law of liberty to be Eternal life light & peace which will increase to all Eternity we ought not to do an Evil to cause pain to any crea-ture, still their are some things that would appear to be evil I know to be good to cut some mens heads off as it would be the ownly way they could be saved. God will increase his kingdom to all Eternity so shall we increase our kingdom to all Eternity 
 Abraham seed will reign as kings of kings & Lords of Lords & to his seed their is no end let this people live& do right & the blessings of God will atted you to all EternityConferenc was adjourned untill the 6th OctOctober 5, 1851 ~ SundaySunday Oct 5th Elder O. Pratt addressed the assembly and said I feel thankful to once more tread my feet in the valley after being absent 4 years I feel thankful to behold the faces of my brethren & friends & see the improvements that have been made in my abscence. I could not tell whare I was I was in danger of being lost without a guide I trustthat while I have been absent on a mission to Great Britain I have also been assisting to build up the kingdom of God & when I left I believed it would continue to roll forththe work had taken such a deep root the powers of darknesscould not break it up it seemed at times as though weshould take the kingdom. The organization of the Churches by the Twelve in that country was so perfect that notwithsta[ndin]g the great spread & increase of the work we can knowmonthly the state of the Churches increase &c throughout the whole realm. The faith of the Saints in that land wasincreasing a great spirit of enquiry was manifestingitself in the High ranks of Society esspecially when they hear of the rapid progress of the work & prosperity of this people we are not hid up as some suppose. It is the general Idea that we are destined to become a great people & a Mighty Nation (is this treason) we are a strong people & destined to be stronger untill our News reaches the utmost parts of the Earth so that when the Mail comes the question will be asked what News do you hear from that mighty people in the Mountains as the emigration increases & ship arive It will all increase the work & it will be as impossible to hide it from the world as it would for the shining of the sun to be hid & Zion will be terrible to the Nations of the EarthI feel as great a desire to help bear up the kingdom as a man can I am willing to spend my life & all I have to build up this kingdom I am willing to stay here or go back tomorrow I presume this is the feelings of the Elders here in this body their is Nothing so Joyful as to build up the kingdom I would rather be abroad binding up the grain than to break up my Farm if I had all the welth of the Earth I would rather go without purse or scrip than to spend the time to work for myself when I look at the magnitude of this work I cannot feel otherwise with the spirit of God in my heart I want to see the Seventies going forth & gathering from all kingdoms & countries & from every Island of the Sea untill all Israel is gatherd. I do not feel to say more to day but willsit down & hear from my Brethren, I wish to do my duty while hereG. A. Smith said it is with pleasure I behold the faces of O. Prat& others this is my Fathers House we have had good instruction from our Brother here I have spent my time to settel other Colonies we cannot all settel down here we should spend our lives to improve & prepare ourselves for immortal glory 
 and exhaltation. I have exhorted my new comers to go down to the south before they settel here & help to build up a stake if you remember the words of God in the days of Joseph says Ye are laying the foundation of a great work and ye know it not. we are now preparing to have a state soon, soon the Brethren will come by 10 100 1000 & 10000We have at Parowan 80 men & boys we want to have evry man who knows any thing about making Iron go to Iron Co. & make Iron as long as we have to buy evry thing & pay 3 prices for it we shall be poor I would rather mak our own ware & ploughes than to be a slave to Missouri or Ill. I never dreamed that when I or any Elderhad a mission to preach the Gospel or build up Zion to ask to be dismissed or return home untill my work was closed such an Idea Never enterd my brain. If the Saints will scatter abroad & settle these far vallies we can come up here & present our tithings & offering & come & worship as they did in Jerrusalem come & raise 1000 bushels of wheat & potatoes & say to the Nations of the Earth come & eat & do sumthing to build up Zion. Afternoon President Young sayes we hear the Brethren arise& return thanks for the blessings received we can respond to it the work is of all importance to the Human family the Brethren are all willing to do right & they say Lord not my will but thine be done. If the Lord should say come & preach to us we would say Amen to it the Lord has his means to carry on his work and also his own means to do it when the peoples hearts are prepared to do the will of God the victory is ours if we come to understanding so as to have the organization of the kingdom of God so that evryone acts in unison like a beautiful peace of machinery [when] we gain the victory we shall then know how to order our speech & conversation aright before God this is a good people cannot we be better we have faith & knowledgecannot we have more of it yes their is an Eternity of it. we have learned to obey by the things we suffer but what do we behold their is evil surmising, speaking, & doing. the Evil intruderhas not left us. who is keeping this commandment that loves his Neighbor as he does himself will save his Neighbor Garden & crops &c we shall then believe & practice allthe commands we shall have one common interest I dont care what you believe if you practice right & act as though you love the Lord & then you will do right their is no school like your own experience when I herd Geore A. Smith speak I thought of former days when men from Canida & other places [would] stop 50 miles this side of Kirtland leave the money with the wife go & see Joseph & say how I love you. But let Joseph ask him for afew dollars & they would instantly dodge at it while in the world you would go away now you are here I canot get you to go to the far vallies because warfare & [carthage]are not there I felt like crying abot Amasa company they were ready to go to Hell. How ready the people are to go to Hell let the Eyes of the saints be open I had to plead with 
 A Lyman & company for days not to go I could not stay them Now I want you to go & you wont go I want to have you go to Iron Co. the people here are so full of wheat & good things that they loath it. If you dont want to pay your tithing the Lord dont want you tithing untill you go into Hell if you dont want to save yourself nor your children nor your dead dont pay your tithing if you do want to save then pay your tithing for it is for your benefit not mine you cannot do the Lord any good in it or add to his glory but it is for yourself. The cattle have come in well of late and I think the best has been sent inyou should be industrious & saving, I dont want my children to b[e] lazy if I die I dont want any man to foster them in idleness make your cloth yourself I wish my boys had to work as I did for a living.October 6, 1851 ~ MondayMonday Oct 6th Conference assembled according to adjournment singing & Prayer by W W Phelps President Young said the time had come to commence the business of the semianual conference the business of the last conference was productive of more good than any conference we ever held. the keeping of the word of wisdom has done much good I will beexceding glad when we arive at wisdom in all things the word of wisdom was given in Kirtland 20 years ago for the benefit of all Saints when we live 20or 50 years longer we shall see that we do not understand much of the word of wisdom we are but babes in understanding wisdom who understands it, was all spoken that might be spoken their is butone ysystem of explaining any Revelation & that is the Rev-elation of Jesus Christ in the heart of man when he possesses the Holy Ghost we are forbidden to use meat in hot weather. Hot drinks & tobaco is not good for man you shouldnot eat to over load your stomach. their is a greater lack in my system of wisdom of tempering my food & exercise than in eating meat or tobaco. Tithing is coming in so fast their will not be room to receive it I wanted this conference to come together so I could see their faces not to scold them I want to see their faces they look better to me than all the Glories of the Earth I said when the Brethren got out of prision I wanted to sit & look at them three weeks Our graineries & stour house are full of wheat & good things If this people are rich beautiful & happy I am withthem. If they are miserable I am still with them if this people are not Crowned & saved none of us willbe [FIGURE] it is in vain for one man to build himself up & neglect his brothers interest He will fail in it. we must begin to manifacture all we want or we are slaves to every thing in all the Earth evry thing is against Mormonism & Mormonism is against evry thing everything is against us Hear it O Earth for the kingdom of God is against all Earth & Hell this is true & we shall fight 
 them untill the kingdom of this world become the kingdomof our God we shall fight battle after battle untillthe victory is won we have to fight & lay down our lives for Christ sake we now want to gather companies to go to the different vallies. I want the potters to rem[ain] here & work at their business. Jesus descended belowall things before He ascended above all things we havegot to sacrafice ever freely in order to be exhalted before God. I once said I will go & build me a houseon the hill out of the mud. Joseph said you will stay whare you are this was enough I dodged as quick as I could I said enough since I have been willing to be Governed by circumstances that have surrounded me & leave the event in the Hands of GodJudge Snow said I arived in the valley in July lastI expected to sit & hear & learn I have been a silent observer of your temporal & spiritual matters. Your Governor has laid a foundation for you to build upon I consider it to be the province of this people to determi[ne] for themselves what they most need I do not see thatyou will break any law of God in doing right & your own will I like the remarks made that you be free & not abject slaves make what you want & be free buy all you want & be slaves. we say we look to gGod & do his will. We are a little people upon a little patch of the Earth but if we all pull together we shall becomethe Head. I did not run with the rest because I thought it right to stay. If I thought it right to run I should run, but it was right to stay so you must be right the Lord said you must gain your bread by the sweatof the brow you must make your own leather or you cannot get money enogh to buy it with so with tea coffee & sugar you must raise & make it or go without it you must make your own Iron or failfor Iron must be had. leathier & Iron must be maid& make your own clothing. I like your conferences& to hear the best men speak to communicate intel-ligence to others the church all draws one way & this puzzles the world they all draw one way & have a reason for it this I glory in I would not obey if their was not a reason for it I would leave Z Snow would not draw with you if he could notgive a reason for it. I came here to deal out Justice to all Jew & Gentile alike I came not to watch foriniquity but to punish iniquity when it does appear I have had 200 cases in a year with the same Noas you are I hope you will not have a case you will never be destroyed unless you destroy yourselfves if you do not war with yourselves I hope others willnot war with you B Young said at our conference we appointed Felt & Banks to be travelling Bishops to visit other Bishopsto call them to an account & see that they are 
 Faithful Bishops & you should feed the poor & do yourduty untill the spirit of God rest upon you & you hold the keys of the Melechezedek priesthood of the Eternal God & the power of it rest upon you foreverBrother Banks & Felt were Ordained under the hands of the Presidency. Afternoon prayer by A Cordon. H. C. Kimball says A Cordon is nominated to be a travelling [Bishop] carried unanimously He was ordained under the hands of HCKJohn & G A Smith Heber C Kimball sealed uponhis head all the keys of the priesthood said the power of God should rest upon his head to preside overother Bishops. Another thing is necessary which willeffect the whole world that is a reffermation chose men who are filled with the Holy Ghost to go forth as missionaries to stir up the feelings of the Saints in all these vallies of the Mountains I thank God that we are free Joseph Young D Fulmer & Z Pulsipher was appointed as missionariesG A Smith arose & said I feel perfectly at home here I want to speak concerning Iron Co I had but 20 or 30 with me there President Young wantsJohn D Lee to get a company to go over the rim of the Basin & form a settlement in a good place  for wine fruit & corn I asked some of Amasas company what they were going to do they said they were going to plant a vineyard if they had done it there they would have done good you shouldgo to Iron Co settle your families then go down in the winter & build a fort the Indians there are well supplyed with arrows on foot No arrows or guns it is poorer than Iron Co it borders upon the Great sahara desert I felt that we arefree when I heard that Iron & coal was found in abundance within 15 miles of each other in Iron Co. we have not the Great Blast Furnises that are in the world but must begin with the Native Element. He also made other remarksB Young made remarks concerning the education of our children wished parents to pay particular attention to teaching their children after which the conference closed it was one of the most interesting conferences ever held by this people.October 9, 1851 ~ ThursdayNov [October] 9th Sunday O Pratt addressed the assembly & said he did not believe any man capable or qualifyed to speak acceptable to God no matter what his abilitieswere unless he had the spirit of the Holy Ghost He would not take any office on Earth if the office of the president of the United States was offered him he would disdain itas far as the honor of it was concerned He would ratherhave the office of a teacher in this church as it would last 
 forever while the office of president of the U.S would notlast but 4 or 8 years I should be glad to live to see the day when their should not be a Kingdom or government on Earth ownly that ordained of God to govern the world I do not know as I shall live to see it but I havemuch desired it for a man to desire to live merely toget honor to himself would not be right but for himto desire to live to honor God & build up his kingdom wouldbe a good desire. If I knew I could be translated to all the glory of the Celestial Kingdom in an instant I wouldrather live & suffer with my Brethren through all theirtroubles untill the coming of Christ I am sorry to seethe old vetrans who have helped to lay the foundation ofthis church lay their bodies in the Grave I believemany will live those who have had it promised unto themif they remain faithful untill the coming of Christ & helpbuild up the kingdom this has been promised to me bythe patriarch & prophet while receiving my Endowmentthe hearts of men were inspired to give us these blessingswhile their hands were upon our heads. this always stim-ulates us to hold on by faith when death is around us & slayes thousands upon our right & left hand it is an easy matterfor God to strengthen a man in his Tabernacle in the midst ofDeath & plagues all around him He did the Ancients who livedto a great Age their Eyes were not dim their Ears were quickto hear but we all have weaknesses & much to contend withthis is that we may increase & arive at Great Glory by getting the mastery over the devil & much evil if we were not tempted & tryed & overcome we should not get theglory that we otherwise shall. How could God trust a man who would be overcome by temptation it would take hima long time to get confidence in him again Jesus wasa fair sample subject as He was to temptation in all thingsHe overcame so can we & follow in the steps of our Elder Brother Better to do this than to Enjoy the pleasure of sin fora season then die as the fool dieth if a man had power givenhim & had not discretion given him to use it he would ruinhimself this is the reason why this people 20 years oldhas not power greater power they have not wisdom to use itwe have the gifts of the Gospel to heal the sick to speakwith New tongues, to cause the blind to see lame to walkdeaf to hear, & cast out devels & with these gifts some have been so lifted up taken honor & glory unto themselvesthey have fallen. I thank God for sparing his gifts anyfurther than they prove beneficial to us if God gave us allthings at once it would kill us but if we were proven in allthings then we could endure all things (things are freq-uently given of the Lord that men cannot all endure theyare more than they have wisdom to manage when this isthe case they cannot advance untill they master what hasbeen given let this be remembered & not ask for more afterwhat we can manage for if we ask the Lord for a Revelati-on & He gives us a New commandment we are under the greater respon-sibility for we have to keep all the commandments of God 
 if commandments are given us & we dont obey then ourlight becomes darkness then how great is that darknessit would be better for him not to have the light at allIf the Lord had given all men all they have asked forthey would many of them been out of the Church now I haveherd many say I have Asked the Lord to reveal certainprincipls unto me & He did not do it but this is because itwas not wisdom to give it unto you but if you are faithfulthe day will come when God will give any man what heasks for if he asks for it in righteousness. I believe the Lord loves this people & is preparing us to recieve all good things the day will come when the Lamanites will builda city called the New Jerrusalem. They not we buildit we with all the Gentiles who repent will help build itthe powers of Heaven will be revealed & Jesus be in ourmidst and the power of Heaven be revealed by Adam & all men will hear it in the kingdom of God and all secrets& key words of the priesthood & all things will be revealedI hope you will harken to council & do all things which God Requires of us in the name of Jesus Christ AmenOctober 12, 1851 ~ SundaySunday 12th S M Blair spoke to the people & gave agood exhortationBrother Simeon Carter followed the same day spoke of the deeds of the prophet He knew the Twelve had to lead, had no desireto follow any body els. He was followed By Brother MajorOctober 19, 1851 ~ SundaySunday 20th [19th] Oct Elder O Pratt spoke upon the deathof Sister Hendricks. He was thankful we as a people weresettelled in these vallies of the Mountains whare it washealthy we have here to fore suffered much by sickness inother places but we cannot get entirely away fromsickness & death let us go whare we will in this lifefor all men must taste of death even those who were translated had to have a change to Immortalitytheir may be some pain attending that even if it was ownly for an instant. Their must be some spacebetween death & the resurrection sin is the cause of thisevil even death without sin men would have beenImmortal. If I should hear of a God who had made man to have pain & sorrow without any agency or sinI could not have any confidence in him, & the Heavens couldnot it may be said it is necessary to have sorrow & miseryin order to Enjoy good the Lord when He made the worldknew how to fix things so that man should bring uponhimself death evil & sorrow if he had ag[ency] He planted the tree of knowledge of good Evil in the midst of thegarden little children did not commit sin but theirparents did it was not our own sins that brought deathbut the sin of our first parents death being introducedinto the world we all partake of it if we had not the greatplan of salvation revealed we should be without lawif it was not for revelation we should not know thatwe had an Immortal spirit within us we should take 
 care of the spirit as well as our bodies the spirit needs takingcare of as well as the body the spirit is a being that possesses certain capacities that are as Eternal as God himself that were never given to it I do not believe that any matter that ever saw the time that it could not lovehate fear &c can ever do it again but I believe it is Eternalthe formation may not be Eternal but the substance of whichit is composed is Eternal the capacities may be enlarged butits capacity always exhisted their may be a time when ourspirits had a begining of formation but the capacity alwaysexhisted the Infant at first appeared as a blank page but that spirit before it came here was full of knowledge as wasthe case with the Babe of Bethlehe[m] Jesus Christ He had wisdom to construct worlds before He came here but had now descendedbelow all things came from His Fathers throne but his knowledgepower & wisdom was laid aside & nothing but the bare capacitywas left can any man remember the first month of hislife in the flesh No Neither can you remember the timeof your exhistance or doings before you came here thisis to prove men if they will prove faithful while this knowled[g]e is taken from them in infancy childhood & manhood life & Death if one man Jesus Christ can ascend & overcome all things so can another. If we find anythingthat is good lovely, virtueous, good, exhalted then let us lay hold of it untill we are exhaulted then the spirit will adorn the body & do away with many of the Evilsof the fall their is sumthing in the countena[n]ce of aman who takes care of his spirit that is glorious& good the Lord made the spirit of man according to theplan devised in his wisdom but this was made of Eternal substance of many beings composed in orse in ourselves brought together into one & Gems given to ourspirits then let us take care of our spirits. many thingmay be said about the object of our bodies & spirits theyare destined to arise in glory Exhaltation And Eternal life then let us take care of our bodies & spirits we haveour minds filled with the cares of life & yet when we die we have to leave all our temporal affairs it seems to be the object of God that we should earn our bread by the sweat of the brow if this was notthe case we might be Idle which would produce moreevil than it would to labour if we improve our timewe shall get glory that we should not get ifwe were Idle for when we die the knowledgewe have gained will be of benefit to us we cannotget a fulness of Glory while our spirit & body isseperated we may think reflect & know rightfrom wrong but we cannot act as in the body we shall look for the resurrection of the body with muchinterest & great anxiety if it was not for the resurrectionof the body we should be subject to the devil & deathtemporal & spiritual those who kept the celestial lawwill be redeemed from all sin & death restored toGod and all blessings their is for man such will haveJoy in paradice. Joseph says if we keep the law we shall 
 we shall have a celestial paradice & our spirits return& hunt up our bodies & enter it again with a fulness ofcelestial spirit. How will the Resurrection be broughtto pass & when will be the different times of the resurrectionthe good ^{and bad}^ will arise before those who die after the Resurrectionof Christ the good did arise at the Resurrection of Christwe find mummies in the catacombs of Egypt who diedlong before christ arose who remain yet some saints inAsia & America did arise & appear unto many. I do not believe the resurrection will take place by being born againas the doctrin of some is I would not believe it for the worldunless President Young was to say the Lord had revealed it to him I believe the Saints will arise out of their graves [##Ezekiel 34:12##] as Ezekiel said they would. The Resurrectionwill take place before the son of Man comes as the scripturesdeclair. Before He comes their shall be a great sign appearin Heaven all the Nations of the Earth shall see it togetherAn Angel shall sound his trump that all Nations will hear it saying that Babylon will be burned then afterhalf an hour of silence the veil of the covering will betaken off the face of Heaven will be revealed & the face of the Lord will be unveiled and the graves of theSaints will be open & the Saints on the Earth will be caught up to meet the Lord this is the first Resurrection theZion of Enoch will also appear & dwell on the Earththe Saints will then receive their Everlasting inheritances Joseph got a promise from the Lord thathe should have a right to an inheritance in the Nauvoo House forever. if the Saints do not get their possessions by covenant as Abram did Canaan or JosephNauvoo their will be Judges appointed to give evry man his inheritances for an Everlasting inheritancethen comes the time when Joseph and all will receivetheir keys & turn them to the saints in this dispensation& reveal the mysteries of Eternity to the Saints whohave their celestial bodies they will be qualifyedto receive a fulness of celestial glory & spirit & willreceive all they can Endure but they will grow toall Eternity in knowledge & power will the Saints beconfined to this Earth No they will be caught up & not die & lie in the dust Jesus will have a Thronein Jerrusalem & the Saints will have thrones on theEarth but they will go to other worlds or in the Heavens& all will be free Adam will give instructions concerningthe garden of Eden we will go on foreign missionsto visit other worlds we shall also remember our worksin this life & inasmuch as they have been good it willbe a consolation to reflect upon themI Baptized Sister Foss & family & my own family & confirmedthem 9 in all.Rhoda Foss was Married on the eve of Nov 30th 1851 
 President Youngs medical lecture deliverd beforethe board of Health at Great Salt Lake City Dec 1851President Young arose & said I wish to impart intelli-gence to the people my first proposition is the science ofmedicine. The study & practice of medicine as a science if it may be called a science is the most imperfect of any science in existance as is practiced by the doctors of the present dayThe doctors & priests of the day send more to death & Hell thenany whare els. about one in a million may get some gloryA bigger set of cursed scoundrels never graced the Earth thanthat class. surgery is a different class & is vary necessary in many instances & that system can be learned. But to learn the system of man they cannot no more learn that than they can learn the Heavens. A worst set of Ignoramuses do notwalk the Earth. they do not know how to turn {the [[illegible} wind in a mansbody when it gets cross ways. If you cut their infernal throats the people will live I know what this society is here for it is to impartwhat knowledge they have to others. But I have seen the folly of the doctors even at my own doors. take them as a whole they are the most damnable set on the Earth their practices are infamous & their medicines produce death; If the people want to EatCalomel let them do it & be damned but dont feed it toany of my family if any doctor does & I know it I wouldkill him as quick as I would for feeding Arsnic. I do not employ such doctors to visit me. I dont Employ any doctorto visit me. The practice of Doctors in visiting women in childbirth is damnable woman should be let alone & let Naturehave its part at work let a woman keep her child if she can2 or 3 years but she cannot do it when the time has come Nat-ure will deliver her of her child without a Doctor dontfret let evry thing take its proper course & sickness would depart away. The Doctors in New Haven Ct by mutual agreement to see how far they could frighten a man didactually frighten him to death a robust harty man. many things should be said to this people. their has not been aDoctor baptized into this church that has the Holy Ghostbut what will acknowledge they are a fool. their is not aPhysician in the church or in the world that is taughtfrom on high by revelation but what will acknowledge this to be true doctrin if their is a doctor who can see & know a man from head to foot & know how to cure his deseases by revelation such are the ownly true & safe Doctors on Earth all others are fools I see men diein the hands of the doctors. the medicines kill them. why dont they tell what ales the patient or acknowledges they dont know.The foolery their is among this class is disgraceful & makes me mad & the day will come when youwill not wonder at my feelings you are natural persons& God has made you natural if you are with child that childwill come forth by nature without a Dr the Earth is justso will bring forth of itself seed after its kind. If a person issick & have not faith to be healed give them herbs the product of the Earth & it will cure you until it is time to die 
 when a cat is sick she will eat catnip without a doctor & she gets well Nature promps her to it if adog is bit with a rattlesnake he will dig a hole in the Earth & lie in the ground untill the poison is gone out so Nature will teach us as well as the cat & dog when a toad is bit by a spider [it] will go & eat plantain if he can get it.If a child is to die in being born let it die but dont employ a Dr to kill it. How will you be instructed I will tell you what to do if you are taken sick dont be frightened but be ca[l]me. if you get a cold let Nature be jo◊◊disease will go up & down through the system to find aplace to be located it is as much our duty to know how to cure our system as to feed our body the Doctors would say you are deseased & dont know it who made the Doctors the Devil. The Lord did not make the Doctors of the present daysuch a thing as a man midwife was not known untill about 1500 why did not the women all die before this timelook at the Indians for 100 years millions of childrenhave been born in the wilderness of male & female & they live& not die without a doctor. You may ask what shall we doI will tell you I will give you a lessen & I want you to remark it when you go to visit a woman in trava[i]l let her alone untill her full time has come remember it let the motheralone let your system be natural teach them also to exerciseall that they can that when they come to be deliverd it willbe better for them. A doctor if he had good sens would notwish to visit women in child birth, and if a womanhad good sense she would not wish a man to doctor them on such an occasion I want you to teach your children the principle of truth I talk as I do for the people willnot sens any thing unless they are half knocked down or thunder rolls in their Eaers soft words will not do I want you to hear & understad their has been some difficultyin this Board of Health. If I had been with you you would not had had any difficulty. It has been through a misunderstandingif you understand principle you would not quarrel youmay spread calomel on your bread & butter & eat it if you wish but it is deadly poison as Arsenic but not asquick it is not good you may ask if it was ever goodin any case there may be cases whare it might be a benefit but it would want a revelation to tell whare it was. Their is not poison in lobelia I will give$5000 dollars for the 16 part of an oz of poison that can be extracted out of all the lobelia in this valley. it isnot probable that any two persons are organized just alikein all respects. Then who is a Physician Now unless hebe taught of God & is a prophet or revelator he cannot understand the Human System know desease & what will cure itI dont care how a man acts if he inte[n]ds to act right & when theyact wrong are willing to be righted. we will take the Best physicianof the day that lives the closest to the Lord I dont care how willhe is he will be brought down as a fool for he will bemade to let God be honored.  I have been on a Journey in the dust I have got dust on my brain that is what ales me 
 It will wash off could a doctor tell what ales me Nocan a doctor tell what ales a sick man by feeling of his pulse No more than he could by feeling of a dogs tail. Their is no Physician except he is taught of Godyou should learn how to doctor yourselves you should studyyour own system, any people who must trust to a doctor atall times will die but trust in God & you will live longerwhat a diferent time it would be if all trusted in God rather than in the doctors for 9 out of 10 die under thedoctors care who would live if they trusted in God alonedont get freightened & you will do well enough it is Justas reasonable to send for a doctor to have a calf, colt orpig brought forth as it was for a child.After you receive your reserrected bodies you will bring forth spirits to all Eternity who will go to some world & take a tabernacle or body the same as we have you dont want a doctor any more here than there if the members of this society are true either male or female they will inpart all useful knowledge they have to others if they are not willing todo this they are corrupt if one man knows more than another let him tell his knowledge & if a man knows more thanall the rest let him be a Father unto the people & teachthem & not act like a boy, if I hold myself Equal I am Equal if I am soperior let me manifest it by doing a better deed & being superior myself. It is the man that rejects light & knowledge when shown him that God condemns & I condemn him some say we have spiritual wives but Ithink God has made us all natural & I think we should be Natural.We received several lectures from Judge Zerubabel Snow concerning law our Legislative Enactments & various other subjects. He commenced with the constitution of the United States said the several states sent delegates & formed a general convention & there after deliberating upon thesituation they agreed to form a constitution & to cede up a portion of their state rights for the purpose of forming a general government constitution & congress of the UnitedStates and all the power that was not ceded up still remains with the people and it was his opinion thatwe as a people had a right to make such laws as suitedour own convenience Notions & circumstances, as long asit did not conflict with the constitution of the united ofthe their were rights belonging to all civilized men which no power had a lawful right to take from themand he advised us to make such laws as we wished withoutany regard to the common law of Englan or the laws whichany of the states had adopted as long as we did not interfere with any of the constitution of the United States. He dweltlengthy upon the criminal code which we should adopt thatcriminal law was considerd more for the suppression of crime than for the punishment of the guiltyI ordained 8 High priest & 7 members of the quorums of seventiesat different Councils at the Council House not befor recorded

 January 4, 1852 ~ SundaySunday Jan 4th 1852President Young addressed the assembly & took for his subject sin & the forgiveness of sin I speak upon this subjectbecause we are in the midst of it, it has been among all classesit has been in our houses in our families & in our hearts andalthough it has been a constant companion their is butfew that understand the Nature of sin. Many have made them-selves miserable thinking they had sined against the Holy Ghost. others that they had sined a great sin. But what have the Revelations of the Lord said upon these subjects we learnthat Jesus Christ came & took a body & redeemed the worldbut Lucipher rebelled was cast down without any body andHe has sought to vex & destroy the children of men. He seeksdiligently to draw all from the right path esspecially if a Saint tries to follow the track & get whare Jesus was then the devil wouldtry hard to over throw them. Many have thought they have committedmuch sin when they have not understood the nature & work of sin. we must understand many principles & arive at muchknowledge before we can fully understand the Nature of Sin. Theveil of Darkness is over the Earth so that the inhabitants of the Earth are so overwhelmed in tradition & darkness they do notknow light from darkness truth from Error wright from wrong or the difference between the dictation of the Holy Spirit or thatconscienc which has been framed for them by the dictationof their mothers & priests. many think far more of the traditions of their youth than of any principle that Godcould reveal from Heaven unto them. their Mothers must not do any thing on Sunday ^to^ darn a stocking would be a greatsin, sin is one thing & tradition is another. The word of God revealed will tell what sin is while tradition will notThe Education of the world is good as far as they have anytruth found in any science which they possess but they do not understand truth as connected with the plan of Salvation. I want the saints here to understand that they cannot sin against God, & Jesus Christ & the priesthood, against his family & the Saints then come & ask forgiveness of the churchthen pass on smoothly & ^think they will^ go to Heaven this is to cheap a way to get to Heaven I want this subject riveted on your heartsif it is not you will not remember it. You must remember yourcovenants & the Law of the Lord that is given to us. It is written that sin is a transgression of the Law whare is it, in the Booksthat is given us in the main yet this does not go into all the me-anderings of life. whare do you find a law that you shallnot drive a team across your Neighbor lot nor go to his haystack or suffer your families to take liberties that you are not willing should be done to you yet you know it to be wrong. But do unto others as you wish others to do unto you is the Law & theprophets. Some men who have been ordained unto the priesthood & are vary high in Authority will take the Name of God invain & swear by this & that does such persons suppose that that the Church can forgive that sin if you do your hope is vainthey can never forgive that sin. No man can do it none 
 But God alone & it never will be forgiven untill He does itthe time will come that if a man will take the name of God in vain he will be hewn down without judgment or trialHear it O ye Elders, for it is time. Let this peoplesanctify their hearts & then take the Name of God in vain& they will not be forgiven the time will also come when if the parents are scanctifyed before the Lord & theirchildren rise up in disobedience against them they willbe hewn down. If you sin against God & take the name of God in vain if you get forgiveness it will have to be forgivenby Him & not from man. some think if they are alone& sware or sin nobody will know it but they will find themselves mistaken still if a man has to sware let him be alone if a man damns himself let him be alonethat others may not be polluted by his sin. If you take the name of God in vain I will not forgive ^it,^ for I cannotif the Lord will forgive you I will forgive you for maringmy feelings by speaking it in my ears the more you see the veil parted & the more you learn the more you will see Godsways are not as our ways this people are passing through a great school of experiance I remember while in Kirtland if any of theBrethren felt their rights infringed upon in any wise or abused wouldretaliate & be ready to quarrel about it & be ready to get up a law suitfor ^a debt of^ three dollars but the minds of the saints have become more nobleNow if a man is abused who understands principle he is above quar-reling about it and he feels to say it is nothing to me I am not to sufferby it but you that have abused me has the penalty to pay. But if the devivel can ownly make you think that you are abused or ill treated and you begin to fret about it and you give the devilpower ^over^ you & in the end it is as bad as though you had done wrong yourselfNow if a man sins against you untill seventy times seven & he repents & with an humble heart asks forgiveness you should forgive him for this is the law & the prophets He must ask forgiveness & be humbleor he cannot be forgiven. As much has been said & many fearsentertained by many concerning the sin against the Holy Ghost I will speak further concerning that subject to sin against the Holy Ghost is a sin against God the Father the Son & the Holy Ghost that bears record of them. A man cannot sin against the Holy Ghost untill the Holy Ghost has revealed unto him the Father & Son &a knowledge of Eternal things in a great degree degreewhen he has a knowledge of these things with his eyes open he rebels against God & defys his power He sins against all thingsif a man does sin against the Holy Ghost the people have nothing to do with it for they cannot forgive that sin & none but Godcan do it & probably He will not in this world nor the world tocome for they become sons of perdition & probably will neverrepent of [their sin] or have a disposition to.If you blaspheme the Name of God dont ask this people to forgive you for they cannot do ityou may ask them to pray God to forgive you. If God doesforgive the sin then you can go down into the waters of baptismwhen you get knowledge you will be ashamed to sinNow I want to bring this subject home what are the acts of the peopledo they not sin & trespass against their Brethren Parrents against their children & children against their parents the husband against the wife & wife against the husband this is with us & this we 
 can reach & manage & tell what ought to be done you oughtto cease from taking the liberty of any person but do unto all as youwould wish them to do unto you infringe upon the rights of noone Borrow no tool but what you will return according to promisetake no wood nor any thing els but what belongs to you and if you find any thing that is not your own do not hide it away but report it that the owner may be found. If I had some stoneshere in my hand I could cast them & hit twor or three in thiscongregation in the head who are guilty of these acts you may say why dont you tell who they are why you poor Devil are you notgoing to repent of it by & by. If not when the day of clensing & santifying of Israels comes you will have to be sacraficed & your bloodspilt upon the ground for the day will come when iniquity mustscease in Zion and the Profane man who takes the Name of Godin vain will be slain.In the days of Ancient Israel Justicewas dealt out in a manner that showed they understood principle &revered the commands of God. it was a mercy to many to haveJustice & Judgment executed upon them on the Earth even tobe slain & have their blood poured out upon the Earth that it might be tolerable for them God made a Covenant withAbraham & his seed that He would save them when theycommit sin He slew them that He might save them by their spilling their blood as an offering. Had they have livedin sin they might have sinned so as not to have been forgivenor saved. it was a mercy to slay them. Now Brethren if you sin against God go to God to get forgiveness if that sin isnot unto death their is a sin unto death which we were told weneed not pray for. if you sin against your Brother go to him to get forgivness ask forgiveness at the hands of the inocentif you sin against your family your parents your husband your wife your childrn seek forgiveness at their hands but whatis done in secret should be forgiven in secret & go no furtherthat sins may be hid. But if sins are committed openly theyshould ask forgiveness & be forgiven openly these are trueprinciples & let them be rememberd foreverGovornor B. Youngs address before the legislativeassembly of the Territory of Utah upon slaveryHe remarked that the whole world were slaves Eve partookof the forbidden fruit & also Adam & it brought slavery upon all their posteriy in some way or other & thi[s] willcontinue untill we become righteous enough to drive the devil & evil from the Earth. Adam had two sons Kane & Abel. KCain was more given to evil than Abel Adam was called to offer secrifice also his sons the sacrifice of Abel was more acceptable than Canes & Canetook it into his heart to put Abel out of the way so he killed Abel the Lord said I will not kill Cane but Iwill put a mark upon him and it is seen in the faceof every Negro on the Earth and it is the decree ofGod that that mark shall remain upon the seed of Cane& the Curse untill all the seed of Abel should be redeemedand Cane will not receive the priesthood untill or salvation untill all the seed of Abel are redeemedany man having one drop of the seed of Cane in him 
 in him cannot hold the priesthood & if no other Prothet ever spake it before I will say itnow in the name of Jesus Christ I know it is true& they know it the Negro cannot hold one particleof Government but the day will come when all theseed of Cane will be Redeemed & have all the blessingswe have now & a great deal more but the seed ofAbel will be ahead of the seed of Cane to all Eternitylet me consent to day to mingle my seed with theseed of Cane it would bring the same curse upon meand it would upon any man and if any man minglhis seed with the seed of Cane the ownly way he couldget red of it or have salvation would be to come forward & have his head cut off & spill his blood upon the groundit would also take the life of his Children It is said ifa man kills another that he takes that that he cannot giveif a mans head is cut off his life is not destroyed or his spirit that lives, his tabernacle is destroyed but I canmake as good tabernacles as I can destroy if you do notbelieve it look at my Children. Much blood was shed in ancient days both of man & beast the firstlings& best of the flock was sacrafized on the Altar & in some instances many men & almost whole Nations wassacraficed or put to death because of their sins & wickednesthis was the ownly way they could be saved at allif Jesus Christ had not had his blood shed the bloodthat He received from his Mother Mary the world would not have been saved. Their is not one of the seedof old Cane that is permitted to rule & reign over the seed of Abel and you nor I cannot help itThose that do bear rule should do it in righteousnessI am opposed to the present system of slaverythe Negro should serve the seed of Abram but itshould be done right dont abuse the Negro & treathim cruel. It has been argued here that many of the Jews were black. Whenever the seed of Judah mingled with the seed of Cane they lost theirpriesthood & all blessings. as an ensample let the Presidency, Twelve, Seventies, High Priest Bishops& all the Authorities say now We will all go & minglewitth the seed of Cane and they may have all the privilegthey want we lift our hands to heaven in support of this that moment we loose the pristhood & all blessings& we would not be redeemed untill Cane was. I will never admit of it for a moment some may thinkI dont know as much as they do but I know that Iknow more than they do. the Lord will watch us all the timethe Devil would like to rule part of the time but I am determin He shall not rule at all and Negros shall not rule us. I will not admit of the Devil ruling at all I will not consent for the seed of Cane to vote for me or my Brethren if you want to knowwhy we did not speak of it in the Constitution it was because it was none of their business 
 any man is a Citizens Black white or red and ifthe Jews come here with a part of the Canaaniteblood in them they are Citizens & shall have theirrights but not to rule for me or my Brethrenthose persons from the Islands & foreign countriesknow nothing about governing the people. The Canaanite cannot have wisdom to do things as the white manhas. We must guard against all Evil I am not goingto let this people damn themselves as long as I can help itFebruary 8, 1852 ~ SundaySunday Feb 8 President Young addressed the assembly and said I trust in the Lord for light as I have heretofore done when the minds of men are open to understand they will see things as they are. we aresubject to all the evils which are in the world. I havethought this world as fallen as any of the creations of God. when the Lord created the Earth or any world if they have an Exaltation they will have to experine all that we Experiane I see no reason why they should not be tempted as we are tempted. If weare candidates to exhaltation & glory & that we cannot get that Exaltations & glory in no other way thenwe should be reconciled to it & be satisfyed to let the Lorddo with us as He pleases is their any Evil upon any peperson or affliction upon any Nation or kingdom that God does not permit their is not we shouldthen be faithful to God in all things to be his secret counsellor if necessary why should we com-plain or find fault with God about any thing we should not. Se the Example of the Nations of theEarth they complain about evry thing and against allhis providences their is no proceding of ours or act or experiance but what He knows all about. If it wouldbe any satisfaction to you I would say that God haspassed through all the trials & experience that we haveJesus Christ has passed through all the trials & experinethe same as we have it would not be prudent forme to say that the Father has not the same experienethat his Son had. He had quite as much as his Sonhad, let the Saints look about themselves & se ifthey hadve as great things as they expected whenthey first received the gospel & the Holy Ghost openedtheir minds they saw that Zion was to [be] built up & Israel gatherd the power of God & the Holy Ghost to bepoured out upon us. If we could get a place by ourseleshow faithful we would live & thank God. Do you have the same things you looked for well I dont know you say thisshows that somebody has let down their watch & inf-luenced others & they have not lived up to their privilegeswhen we first received the gospel we were humblebut since the tempteor has come & we are tempted withmany things but this is right the Lord permits itwe could not get glory without it let me ask if any 
 one is here who went to Jackson County in 1831 The feeling was If I could get with the Saints all my sorrow & trouble would be at an End so it is with the Saints in England. Before we preached the gathering to them the lord revealed to them that they would be gathered we told them not to reveal it untill the time came do you have any thing now that you looked for in the begining if not sumthing is the matter you dont do right you dont settle this difficulty or that but what is the matter you are wrog yourself what henders you from praying all day & fasting and prayer you have enough to eat but the great difficulty is when they moved to Zion they brought themselves with them you had so many devels in you that they trouble you. when the devel & wicked men have afflicted & persecuted us as far as is for our good then the Lord says stop & go no further they are held up but if we take evry thing patiently all our afflictionswill work together for our good. But do you at the present time have any thing to mar your peace except what you bring upon yourselves you have privileges here but do the people prize their privileges why do the people go to the kanyons after wood on Sunday why have they gone today why dont I do it why do I not visit my farm the Bath House on Sunday because it is not right & sets a bad example I cannot do these things on the Sabbath Some will take poles of[f] from his Neighbors farm take a chain or an ax without liberty this is wrongtheir is nothing on Earth to mar our peace but owur own acts but the great difficulty is they cannot getaway from themselves. they think perhaps if they go to the gold digings they can get away from themselvesbut they cannot. When persecution & trials come they search the good seed and it dries up. How are you going to get Zion nothing henders our having Zions but ourselves we have all the privileges of Angels to worship God & get all blessings we need. we mean to war with all Devils temptations & trials untill we overcome I will fight untill I overcome if I fall in the grave their is others who will take my placetheir are many who will fight & if it needs be wewill take the sword I hope all who want good principles will have the privilege of receiveing them to day is a day of tithing & sacrafice tomorrow cometh the burning I would say that you cannot be perfect without me nor I without you the providences of God has so interwoven & identifyed the interest of the Children of Adam together that they cannot be perfect without each other do you enjoy your-selves & have peace. I have peace & no man can take it frm me if you do not have peace it is because you drive stakes & the Lord will not let you do it but let the will of God be done if you dont Enjoy Zion it is because you dont say let the will of God be done their is nothing to take your Zion away but yourselves we are to be tryed & tempted 
 in evry way in order to prove ourselves the friend of God in all things & God will bless you my prayer is that Godwill bless this people & that they may be faithful and a friend to God. I told the Legislature that I would be proud to have the world know that I told the assembly to fast & pray untill they get the spirit of God to do their duty I would like to see the Judges upon the bench to ask God to bless them and all the Jury & witnesses to assist them in all their testimony & decissionsMarch 1, 1852 ~ MondayMonday March 1st 1852 This is again my birth day I am 45 years of age this day the Lord hath preservedme thus far in life I pray that He may still preserve me and lengthen out my days to behold the work of the Lord on the Earth & to assist in carrying on that work I spent the day with the LegislatureMarch 2, 1852 ~ Tuesday to March 3, 1852 ~ Wednesday2 & 3 I spent the time with the Legislature it was a vary busy time with us As we were about to close The members of the Joint session concluded to have a day of recreation feasting & rejoiceing on the morrowMarch 4, 1852 ~ Thursday4th Thursday The Govornor President of the Council [FIGURE] Speaker of the house with all the members of both branches of the Legislature assembled with their ladies at the Council House & Legislative Hall & partok of an exellent fest and had an excellent social party {We all went forth in a dance} The Govornor gave an interesting address in the evening which closed with a shout of Hosannah All returned home satisfied with the procedings of the dayMarch 5, 1852 ~ Friday5th Both Houses met in Joint Session this morn and spent a busy dayMarch 6, 1852 ~ Saturday6th Saturday Both Houses met in Joint Session and closed up all the business of the Session and adjourned untill next December the Govorn blessed the assembly and the President of the counsel& Speaker of the House returned thanks to the master The Assembly returned a vote of thanks to the Govorn and all returned their homes I spent the evening in school learning FonographyMarch 7, 1852 ~ Sunday7th Sunday I preached in the school House in the 13 ward visited Brother Hardy in the Afternoon & foud Charles Hardy was fast sinking with the Consumption He will not live long.

C. Kimball & W Richards who compose the first Presidency O Pratt W. Woodruff & G A Smith of the Twelve Apostles Also the Patriarchs John Smith & Isaac Morley The president of the Stake D Spencer The Presidents of the several quorumsThe Tabernacle was filled to overflowing in an hour after the doors were open & hundreds could not get into the houseThe President took the stand at 10 oclok and said we adjourned last conference to meet in the tabernacle to day we are here in the New Tabernacle according to apoint-ment. The Hymn was read & sung (Lord in the Morning thou shalt Hear). The diedication Prayer was offered byWillard Richards it was great & good is published in the Deserett News then two Hyns were sung. The Prsidtdent I arise to say a few words as we have offered the dedication Prayer upon that subject who could foresee the way of the Lord as we now See it we can now beho-ld the manifestation of the Lord. He has done what we could not have expected but we have an experience that teaches us to trust in the Lord. we should not undertake to dictate the Lord for his work will go on we have seen plenty try to dictate the Lord and try to build up themselves & not this kingdom but they soon fall and the Lord overthrows them but this work goes on the gospel is preached & all his work goes on let the wicked do what they please wehave the privile[ge] of worshiping God and being happy. I wish to dedicate all I possess unto God & praise him & do all He requires of me. At the last conference I was sick & not able to be with you not able to be up I meditated upon the state of the 
 Church. I see some going to the right some to the left some aftergold and the riches of this life I said I would tell theBrethren my feelings I said I would go to work & build a Tabernacle & worship the Lord so that wewould not be driven home by a storm I saw alsothat some would say I cannot go for I must take careof my cattle my farm my fields &c but I said I wouldgo & worship God as long as I wished If the wholeEarth sunk. Some delight in a fine Horse farm orHouse or good things ofin this life but this is nothing to you it is good in its place. But you cannot pray becauseyou cannot spend time. some women cannot spendtime to have prayers you know it is your duty to pray& dedicate yourselves to God & your family & all youpossess some feel as though they must go to night tothe canyons. But if you will harken to council you will sayto all the world Stand By I am going to worship the Lordlet the dead Bury the dead and dedicate myself & family &all I have to the Lord. No matter whather the Lord setsyou about go at it & do it. Their is a great change with this people we have been sick now are well have been poor now are rich, Have been distressed & mobed nowhave peace How long will it last as long as this people do right It has been 22 years since this Church was organized we should serve the Lord Love the Lord with all our hearts scease to do wrong or find fault with anyof the Saints if they do wrong Chastize them & not hate them. are the people prepared to make a covenatto dedicate themselves & their hearts to God from this hour I feel to urge all the Brethrn & Sisters todedicate themselves unto the Lord. If we can gain the victory & say I will do the work of the Lord inall things. If He will make his will known I willperform it. Not ownly say but perform it dedicate ourour affections unto the Lord. we may find some thatcannot feel it, they say I want some gold or somthingto help myself with to get out of difficulty what will be done in such a case, I will tell you what I would do IfI had got but one cow & she plagued me I wouldgive her away if you have any thing that is in your way give it away to the public works Let nothing get betweenyou & God and I will tell you what to do if any thing gets between you & God give it to the service of God foryou cannot get through the gate of the Celestial Citywhy are you not as pure as the Church of Enoch becauseyou are not a mind to be I will make my hands do the willof God & my heart will go with it. The spirit of Envy willnot obey then unite your interest with this kingdom forthis kingdom will stand forever then put your interest with it so that you cannot get away then you willstick to the kingdom but if your purse of gold is in yourpocket & you Apostitize you will go away but if your interestis in the church & [you] do wrong you may stay untill you get the spirit of God again & may be saved we must build 
 up this kingdom first & dont be afraid of Starveing for this kingdom will be an ever lasting Kingdom that willnot be throne down it will Stand forever the more thewicked try to throw it down the more it will standif you want it to stand unite your interest with it in such a manner that you cannot get it awaythen you are safe if I was to ask what your opinionwas concerning the Millenuam I should get a great many opinions but the truth is all will bein one sens as it is now you will eat, build, & do all things as now ownly you will be more pure& united and all will serve the Lord & not the devil any more let this people possess this spirit & Herewould be the Millenium it would be with any peoplethat would do that the President then blessed the peopleand asked God to bless them they then sung an hymand adjourned till 2 oclok2 oclok PM. The House was crouded to excessO Pratt of the Twelve Apostles addressed the Assembly(after singing & prayer) He said I address you but not withoutmany reflections upon my mind. It is no small matterto address such a sea of faces if the Lord does notpour out his spirit upon me it will not be but a littlebenefit for me to speak yet I do feel a great desirefor the Lord to give me his spirit for your sakethat you may be edifyed I feel anxious to receiveprinciple & the salvation of the living & dead what has that to do with the living it has much to do with itit is a truth revealed from Heaven that we are to besaviors upon Mount Zion to redeem the living & the deadthis is the subject that is given to me I am determined totrust in God who will give any man their portion in due season the responsibility of preaching this go[s]pel to all the world & redeem the dead we must live before the Lord in such a manner that we can have his appro-bation what says the Book of Mormon upon this subjectthose that assist in building up Zion & shall do it by faithshall have the blessing of the Lord upon them How will we do it by listening to the council of the priesthood of theChurch & consecrating ourselves before God to his serviceas we were told by Presidet Young we shall then have the power of the Holy Ghost & what greater gift can we have then this for this will teach us all things and ifa faithful man is sent abroad to any Nation to preach theGospel & is faithful & follows the spirit of truth He will accomplish his mission in spite of all Earth & Hell. whenNephi was sent back to get the plates of Brass & hisbrethren would not go the Lord told Nephi that He was stronger than 10,000 men to go & He would deliver the plates intohis hands he went & done as the Lord told him & got the plateslook at this people our enemies told us we must go away tothe west & not stay with them untill we were driven intothe Rocky Mountains but the Hand of the Lord was in it& the Leaders of this people were as much inspired to come to this place as the Nephits wer to get the plates 
 we can see that the Lord caused us to accomplish what we could not have done we see today a great massof Saints before us we have been sustained by the Handof God in all thes things. The Lord hath said I will giveyou an inheritance that you shall have in time & Eternityand Israel shall be led by the keys which I have givenwe have been led into a goodly land with our good Houses& fields of grain & all good things so their is Hardly room enough to receive it can it be possible that any man after seeing all the goodness of God up to this time can have a doubt about this work being true can you find a people that has got wisdom enough to get a revela-tion for themselves unless God is with them this people arewilling to do all things as far as they understand the Mormons are increasing & will incres and their is no power that willstop the work of the Latter Day Saints. I rejoiced this forenoon while looking upon the faces of the saints & to see the spirit ofGod upon them & that their union was increasing & that they wishedto hear & learn truth He refered to a certain Revelation that saidthat Zion should look upward & their Union be incresed & wasstrengthened then Zion should look down from above refering to the Zion of Enoch And that Zion would come & the Heavens would shake with gladness & the Earth wouldtremble with gladness and they will build up each otherI want to see that day come that we may see the Old Jerrusalem Jentlemnt Adam this people will then look but smallin comparison to what will be at that time. Here are theTwelve & seventies & thousands who will bring the gospel to all men and Israel who are numerous will have to havethe feelings all manifested to them they must be visited& instructed as we have been they must be gathered as we have been we cannot be perfect withoutthem no more than they can be perfect without usthey all must be gathered from the fore quarters of theEarth & be instructed together & be prepared for the coming of the Lord is there not a prospet ofthis being done yes their is as much I wish youcould have a view of the state of affairs in Englandtheir was some 40,000 saints baptized when I leftand there was not one in 400 but what would give all they possessed ion Earth to be set down heremany of them would be faithful if they were hereagain would not the saints of the western Islands be gladto come here they would & they will come you remember the parable of the vineyard that the servants of the Lord had to labour & keep the top & roots Equal so that the topneed not be to heavy for the roots if we can get a few thousands of the Saints that we can teach & instructso that they will become strong in faith & works then wewan bring in thousand of weaker ones & they get tried the strong ones can succor them & they become strong also& the Devil have No power over them & Zion will soon be Esstablished & thousands upon thousands will come fromthe Nations to take shelter under the tree of Liberty in thegospel & kingdom of God from the dire calaminities of 
 of famine Pestilence & wars which will be poured out uponthe whole Earth there is sumthing els to be done to prepare this people for coming Events Here are many of the remnantof Joseph that have got to be felt after & redeemed I believethe signs of the times indicate that that the time has come when the work must commence if they are sunk in the lowest depthsof degredation yet they are the chosen seed the desendants ofJoseph who was sold into Egypt the promises are unto them they must be redeemed could we be placed in a bettercondition to commence the work than we Now are we cannotlook what way we will they are all around us and the prom-ises of God are to be fulfilled then shall we not pray forthem let us exercise faith in their behalf & do all we can for them. No you not they are to be the main instrumtsthat will build up Zion & Her Temples and all theGentiles who repent shall assist the remnant of Jacob tobuild up Zion & the power of Heaven will come down to Helpthem. First we are to introduce the gospel to them & teachthem the principles of the Kingdom of God & give them the prie-sthood. Do you want to see the Zion of God built up & the Temple of the Lord reared up in this Generation upon the conse-crated land then pray for the remnets of Joseph & their redemption for they have to assist in gathering all the Houseof Joseph & when they all get together the Heavens can nolonger be stayed but their prayers & faith will prevail& the Heavens will come down & meet with the Saints thenbe ready ye Elders of Israel to go when the Lord calls upon you by his servants to leave all to go to preach thegospel to them in their own language & tongue and thepower of God will rest upon you I believe the Lord will send forth his messengers who are ordained unto thispower to go forth unto the Lamanites & will clothe them withfar greater power than when they were sent unto the corrupt Gentiles the Lord will not come untill we go to this people we have a portion of the power of God with usbut not in its fulness as it will be in days to come thispeople will have to be tried in all things & proven & whn theyare found faithful & united they will then thrash the Nations by the power of the spirit of God & they cannotHelp themselvesOrson Spencer then arose & madea few remarks. Felt to rejoice in the principle that had been presented to us they had cheered his heart & theHearts of this people I hope we shall improve & be faithfulfor these principle are true The Lord says my people shallbe willing in the day of my power that people who have givnthe war hoop & crept through the brush find the spirit of God& of their Father Jacob once more running through theirveins & the people who think they are almost extinguishedwill find they are still alive & will fulfill all that issaid concerning them. But I must say nothing I must Hush. I will Hush. But will God Hush & be stillNo He will stir up the remnants of Joseph in his our & in his own time. The Nations of the Earth are trying to bondtogether they may do so & be prepared for the day of burningthe child will be taken care of untill He can take care of 
 Himself we are on the stage of action & we have our part to act in this great work and I rejoice that we have a prt in the work and that it may roll on spedily is my PrayerApril 7, 1852 ~ WednesdayApril 7th House filled at an Early hour to overflowing conference opened at 10 ock.

Presidnt Youg remarked that No doubt before you get home you will hear we have committed treason.with regard to the labour of this Tabernacle I will say the cost will be read before the meeting and all the Tithing & outlay but if you feel that if your Expectations are realized you should be satisfyed I will say I never saw No one room as conven[ien]t as this it will seat 2200 persons & their was is 2500 persons prst [present] today. I expect the Tabernacle which we expet to build onthis Block will seat fifteen Thousand people we never did build a House large Enough to Hold the people if we was to [illegible] this whole 10 Acre Block so that it would hold 200,000 people by the time we got it done their would be enogh to fill it. The Lord is controlling our affairs & does more for us than we can 
 do for ourselves or ask him to do for us the more we are humble & labour & prepare for the gathering of Israel the faster they will gather the Esstablishment of this Tabernacle was the result of my meditations while upon a sick bedIf their is any man that is full of the Holy Ghost & wishes to speak let him rise up & speak & use his liberty I feel as usual to praise the Lord with all my heart. The hand of God has been as visable in leading this people as it was in leading Israel in the days of Moses some had not faith to come on for fear of Starveing to death. dont be in a Hurry to goaway but stay untill you have worshiped Enough at this timeBrother Kempton spoke a few moments believed this to be the kingdom of God had No Doubt of itPresidnt Young remarked that the Gentile would take exception to what is said Here I know as the Lord lives that the people of the United States have departed from the spirit & letter of their Constitution and this people will be the ownly the people that will sustain ^it^G A Smith arose & said we are a singular people if we signify that we cannot worship as other Sects do but want to exercise our rights it is considered Treason but a Senator from South Caralinia could rise up in the Halls of Congress & declare that that the United States was more tyranical than the Goverment of Austria & South Carolina would reject the Goverment this would not be considered treason but dont be alarmed God rules our destiny & will rule the world & if we do our dooty their is no power that can harm us for we will make God our refugeBr Gifford spoke a few moments & bore testimony of the work of God Had Been in the Church 21 years in June next Wm W Phelps next followed said this was the third time He had been to a Dedication of a House built to worship God I was at Kirtland while the Angel of the Lord came in & sat there During service. A Hymn was sung & adjned till 2 ockMet according to adjoument singing & Prayer. The President then Said we shall now lay before the Conference the manifesto of the Recepts & Expenditures of the Tithing from Oct 1848 to March 27th 1852Amount Received in cash $28950.00In Produce $90310.803In Horses Mules Cattle &c 23515.45In Houses Lots Lands & wggons 66546.21In Labour 35445.04$244747.03Profits on Store goods 17711.70Goods Bought not yet paid for 42372.43Loaned Cash not Paid 17731.17

But I said I would kill any man that sought to take me many thought mypurse reached from Eternity to Eternity that there was No End. we were Called bogus makers Brother Kimball said we would go whare we could coin the pure gold $10 at a lick we have done so even $20 at a time Our Brethen went to Calafornia the Hand of God was in all this they openedthe gold mines and the Lord had a Design in it to see who would be tryed by it. Never did nor never will any of the saints go to dig gold ther without being sent without being damnedby it mark my words if we go onto the devils ground we shall be left to smell Hell we shall feel the wrath of God if I was sent there by the Lord I would go but the Lord has not called 
 me to go many Elders in Israel good men have tryed it & smutted themselves up so that it is quite a question if they will ever be washed clean I have said I did not think their was $1 in $20 paid in Tithing that has been spent on the public works but it seems from the Book that there has been about one fourth the other three fourths I have had to borrow. If I have to borrow all the money that is used and none assist me to pay it it will make my head ake I have trusted the Lord & served him all the day long and when I undertake any thing I persevereuntill I accomplish it I see the difference betwen trustingin God & doing business according to the order of the worldtheir is not one hair droped from my head unnoticed & does God not know what I want. their never was a miracle ownly to the Ignorant. It is all to be accounted for on Natural principles. The Lord will not turn stone & clay into gold to suit me their is enough without it Jesus did not make bread out of stone but He had knowledge & power & did call togethethe Elements to make bread & the Elements into the water to make wine & he can call the Elements together to make gold as well as bread & wine. But the Lord is not going to work a miracle to clothus raise your wool & flax & spin & weave it &make it up & not have to pay cash for evry pound you use & what you by is hardlyworth making up but what you make is strong & will wearBrother Major spoke on Home manufacture a few mometsWednesday Evng The Elders filled the House at an Early Hour and was addressed by President B. Young who arose & said this is certainly a mixed congregation of all the Officers of the Church we are to be instructed in all things. the knowledge that is now in the midst of this people is more than in all the world besides. All sceince is in the midst ofthis people even if they have not learned it as the world has. I have my cogitations & views of the affairs of this kingdom but I have learned that we must write work to the scribe if not we may fail in it but if we work in faith & confidence the Lord is apt to Help us. I asked a favor of the Bishops to divide the money debts in Each ward, that it might be paid. Let us contend withourselves & disipline ourselves untill evry thing that is within usis brought in subjection to the Law of Christ you have beentaught the first principles of the gospel now teach yourselves & the Church. Our school is the school of the prophets this is a school to plain & polish ourselves and suppose under such privilege we should endulge in Evil & neglect our families & our duty to Godall our former sins would be upon our Heads it is for a man to commit himself & all that He presides over unto God to do his will & continue to do it untill you are sanctifyed. if your Neighbor does you Evil do not do evil to them bear with him & set him right but do not quarrel with him but be careful that you conduct yourself well untill you are prepared for the society of Holy men this is as I said the school of the Prophets Our Baptism is ownly the begining of our work you must then go on to perfectionyou must perform this work our children understand the gospel but do they understand the way to govern their lives we will never se a day but what we can learn we shall not inherit the glory of God all at once or understand all knowlede but God teaches us small principles to prepare us for greater ones Let us learn in this school 
 there is a great many Books of Education of the present day the main main Branch of our study is Theology I understand it better than any of the world. Adam, Enoch, Moses & Aaron, Jesus & the Apostlehave all been in the same school in their day & have faithfuly lernd that they might be perfected. They are my Brethren & will be my company and I now tell you if you want me to have full fellowsipwith you scease speking Evil of God & all good men whether in Heaven or on Earth.When a man is in the right tract he will come& lay down any thing at the feet of a Brother to settle a difficulty & rather wrong themselves than to have a difficulty do for the truth sake& my sake take my councel. The people want revelating this is Revelation [FIGURES] If you wanted Revelation written I could write Revelation evry day about Building a Temple diging gold going to England or any othe place I profess to be an Apostle Evry Apostle will have to be a Revelator & have Revelations if their is thousands ofthen if they do their duty & live up to thei calling if not they will have to be removed but a man that is not an Appostle has not power to stand at the Head of the Kingdom of God Hold the keys of the priesthood & build up & lead the church of God the Highest Authory on the Earth is an ApostleJesus Christ will have a set of men[By] Young said with him that will follow him to the [end] and to all that He requirs of them they will have the greater glorybut those that cannot endure these things will have a Lesser gloryG. A. Smith followed & said I want to bear my testimony to the saints Many want a mission but let me tell you that anyman who has been baptized into this kingdom that moment he took a mission whill will contine untill death before it closesif we do not work in all things agreeable to the Council of the Church it would not be right talk of paying one tenth & buying our way to HeavenBrother Joseph wished the Seventies to subscribe as much as as a gimbl &handle to build up the Seventies Hall if Brothr Joseph Young had the right spirit he would not ask for such subscriptions if the Elderswas as ready to build that Hall as they would be to go on a missin they would rise up & do it right off & the quicker you commenceto build the quicker it will be finished & such a Hall will be worth 5 times the amount of personal property make your large farms large large Houses & Have spare Rooms & neglect public Building it would be a loss you may work yourself almost to death and then be called away at a momets warning I was called to go to Iron County. Some Elders that was called to go on that Mission sent gold diggers to go in their place & fill the mission for them I never thought of leaveing a mission that was given me untill that mission was closhed closed up many worked all winterto build & put in grain then Left it in the spring & go home. Our Mormon News is our paper. we should sustain it. we are neglectingthe Education of our Children. knowledge is power the Lord will help those who help themselves. the English by the knowledge they possessed conquered 200,000000 of people & brought them in subjection to there ownLaws what we learn we shall carry with him us the mobs will burn our homes & destroyed our property but they cannot burn or destroy the knowlede of our hearts. we should keep the Sabbath it is not right to spend this day in Hunting cattle &labouring but should spend the time in the worship of God & we shouldimprove each leasure momet in treasureing up knowledge if we 
 could lay up one Idea each day for a year we should have a store of knowledge that no man could exhaust in a speech of three hours in length and the wicked could not stand before you. the most learned man of the day is Burrett A Blacksmith He was a self learned & made man pay attention to this Brethn & improve you by it we now have the privilege of speaking in one of the Best Halls in the world thak God Amen Zera Pulsipher spoke & bore testimy of the workApril 8, 1852 ~ ThursdayThursday 8th House filled at 9 oclok Meeting opened by Prayer by Wilford Woodruff who also addressed the Assembly spoke in sum measure upon the subjet of Education He said we are comm-issioned to preach the gospel to all the world & stand before kings & rulers it is our duty to store our minds with knowledge learning & wisdom that we may be qualifyed to stand before all men the Lord has called upon this people & ordained them to preach the gospel & make war upon the powers of darkness & continue that warfare untill the Earth is redeemed & the name of God honored am[on]g men who should spend all of his life in preaching the gospel & should ownly bring in one man into the kingdo of God who should be saved with an Everlasting salvation that man would have cause to rejoice through all Eternity over the redemption of that one Soul & if He brings ^m^any souls into the kingdom of God His Joy will be still greater. The warfare of the saints is great in the Earth in this dispensation & we should all take hold of it with a determination to conquer & never scease untill our warfare is accomplished and evry man will be satisfyed with his reward in the End. many other remarks were made by the speaker who soon gave way for Orson Spencer the chancellor of the Deseret University who delivered an address upon EducationOrson Spencer Delivered an address upon the subject of Education which he read from his manuscript which I suppos will be published in the Deseret News so I did not report itJudge Z Snow made a few remarks & said if a woman was an Educated & Exalted minded persons she would teach good principles to her children A person without any Education would be as ignorant as the unborn child for whatever knowledge a person did possess he got it by some kind of Education. Some think that Education consists soleley in teaching Elementary Braches it may consist in farming or any persuit of life. We have got to create all we have out of the Elemets aroud us & we want to learn how to do it we must manufactur all we use for if we get any thing from the States we will have to pay High for it. if not bring us into Slavery by it therefore we must lay a plan to beat our Enemies or they will beat usW W Phelps followed with some remarksPresident Young next followed & said the subject I aim at is to Enlighten the mind it is expected we have to learn letters with regard to the principle of Education it commences with the mothers I do not like to see Mothers attend to every thing Els but their children they should teach their childr[en] all they can for Early impressionn will last persons throgh life whether they be good or bad I will tel you the truth as it is in Eternity if the child does not have good instruction in Early life it will be required at the Hand of the Mother & not at the hand of the Mother ^Father^ 
 the Child will think the mother is the best woman on Earth & the mother has power to instill into the mind of the child what they please, & what the Mother imparts unto them will stay with them through life the Mother should take [care] of the children & not spend their time watching the Husband it is the duty of Mothers to Stay at home & take care of the children. My duty calls me to be in this Stand I know not what my children are about or what they are doing they may be in the Streets swareing what I know as others do if they should go to Hell it would be required at the Hands of the Mother & not at my hands A Child of mine shall not conquer me I would sooner see them die than that they should conquer me. If any one of my Children will not follow my footsteps I will disinherit & disown them they shall not have part in my kingdom I would rather get children adopted to me that will keep the commandments. No child should rise up & teach & controll the Mother Or woman should ^not^ rise up & dictate the Husband and the Husband should not rise up & try to dictate His president or the LordIn speaking of the English Language he said it was vary incorrect He would not adopt it any more than he would the Methodist disipline.Education begins with the Mother to the Child you must keep it in rememberane that the Lord has commanded you to multiply & replenish the Earth that you may have Joy & rejoiceing in the day of the Holy Resurrection do you keep your minds pure & do you prey night & day now pray from the time of conception till the time of Delivery that your child may be filled with [FIGURE] the Holy Ghost & that a Noble Spirit from Eternity may come into the tabernacle & that the Holy Ghost may rest upon the Father Mother & child often when some speak you cannot understand they make use of such High flown words but when I speak you can understand for I speak to you understanding. the variety in the English Language I would like to be with the Holy Ones who are full of Eternal light. A point of the finger or motion would communicate without words when I am full of the Holy Ghost I can se a man as well behind me asbefore I can see their hearts by the spirit of God & know what is in them. Adjourned till 1 oclokMet according to adjournet at 1 oclok President Young arose & said red a Hymn which was sung. Prayer offeredH. C. Kimball then arose & said I wish to speak to the understandings of the people I never saw any room like this on Earththe cock pit in Preston is some like it I am satisfyed that We cannot build fast Enough to accomodate the People. Presidet Young teachings are sweeter than the best morsel I ever tastedif we are faithful in keeping the commandmts of God you will never fall in battle but will be preserved to finish your work on Earth Other intersting remaks were made by Brother kimball. Volenteers were then kalled for to go with their teams to meet the Emigrats 100 was kalled for 88 names were taken who volunteered. Some men were then appointed to go on Foreign Missions as follows 
 Thomas Margaretts to Italy. T B, Bube Broderick John Dolley, John Armstrong to England George Parmon to the nations Wm Fatheringham go to Calcuty. Edward Stephenson to Giberalter. James Dilly & two others go to Scotland Alfred A Smith go on a Foreign Mission. Meeting was then Adjned so the 70 could have the Room at 4 ockThe Seventies held a meeting & was addressed By Joseph Young G. A. Smith W Woodruff & others conc[ern]ing buildings the 70 Halls & other mattersApril 9, 1852 ~ FridayFriday 9th snow storm in the morning House Filled & meeting commened at 9 oclok After Prayer the people were addresed By Phineas Young who exhorted the people & spoke many good thingsPresident Brigham Young said this people are blessed with all that Heart can wish and yet manyare not satisfyed this is the case with smome some spirits & they want things illegally but is it not necessary that we should have a Temple it is absolutely necessary that we should have a Temple to worship the Most High God in. A Tabernacle is to assemble the Multitude for meetings but a Temple is to gather the priesthood in that they may do the work of the Lord are we prepared to go & redeem our dead is their a place prepared to go & Redeem our dead No their is not we give Endowmets Here but it is like trying to step on the top round first. if we had the privilege of steping on building a Temple our works would not be legal but we do these things untill we have time to build a temple if we had gone onto the top of the mountains if we had no room it would be legal & right Brothe Kimball says we have to make our own heaven. The Lord cannot save us if we do not save ourselves. if we expect to get ourselves Endowmets we have got to follow the footsteps that God has set for us to walk in & if we walk in that Channel God own our labours & acknowledges all that is done. Now all the ordinances willhave to be attended to again when we get a temple yet if any one dies in the faith those ordinances will be legal but all that live will have to do it again And I want to say as a Revelation that if you will not help build a Temple & havefaith in the work you will be lost a word to those who have got their Endowments we shall work as fast as we can and what we have done is legal if we had been in own land & had a right to a Temple we should not do as we now do many [who] have died in the faith have been worn out ther ordinaces are legal. Those who came in the church first & are faithful have a right to the ordinances first. I wish the people to understand that when the People Lord has any thing for them they will have it but when the Lord has Nothing for the people I dont wish them to teaze me for what they cannot have. when their is to be a work done I will tell you. Now we shall begin to build a Temple in 1853. This Tabernacle will have to accomodate the people untill the Temple is built. if this wont answer for the people untill we build a Temple we will make a Bowery on the North & South sides of the Block as soon as the Temple is built we will give you your Endowments 
 if their is any who was in Jackson County & other places & have helped to build up the kingdom of God in the early days we want to bless them first & if their is any man or child who went in the Battalion or inthe Pioneers come forward & get your blessings beforeothers & we will bless you if you are faithful their is no blessing in the Celestial Law or kingdom of God but what you will get I want to be sealed to my Father before I shall be a legal heir. If I was to die & their was not a child of mine to live to do it for me Some Friend would beraised up to do it for me if not my Body will soon be raised up and I would be in some temple with my Brethren to tell them what to do I can see the Hearts of man & the Spirits of of men if they do triy to be hid I can see them I see manywho asspire to be the first & to be exhalted above their fellowsbut I can tell you all you will be rewarded accordingto what you do whether you do little or much or nothing at all some wish to be above Brother Brigham why was I not called before Brother Brigham Joseph why does not some one ask the Lord to appoint them to be above Brother Brighambut the Lord will laugh at you such forget the kingdom of God they are corrupt let evry man say what can I do to build upthe kingdom of God Ask the Mother who is trying to do the will of God what her reward will be they will say I dont know I will say if you are faithful & satisfied with your condition in this life and you will be blessed & satisfyed with your conditonin the world to come let evry one strive to be satisfyed with their condition in life & that will be a blessing to themwe are in debt & we can pay those debts in oxen now we want to have the Brethren turn out some oxen to pay those debts &cElder Banks followed in some interesting remarks & said the spirit of God was burning like a fire in his bones I dont ask Brother Young to say that theLord has sent him & that he must say this or that in the name of the Lord I dont belive that any man has made a sacrific for this kingdom for all that a man does he gets his reward for not ownly in this world but in the word to come Eternal life. it is distressing to hear men say they wantthe president to get a Revelation in order to do this or that his council to me is sufficient. I also hear men say thatwe are the off scourings of the Earth it is a great burlesk onthe Church & kingdom of God for you are the greatest people & the most blessed of any on Earth you have power to teachkings & princes & potentates of the Earth tremble. I have seen a man that had learned but 3 letters & forgotten 2 of them was ignorant yet he made a learned Doctor fear & tremble &leave the House this people are a wonderful people there are none like them I have herd the Presidet say that instead of our being called to pay one tenth we should be healed as Tithing & end all we possess be ready to help build up the kingdom of God the spirt of God is w with this peopleBrother John Young next addressed the assemble & bore Testimony tha Joseph Smith was a prophet of God tha Brigham Yog H. C .Kimball & W Richards 
 instead of being heirs according to promise. the pristhood is eternal without the begining of days or end of life as the Apostle has expressed it but man through aposticy which is entire disobedi-ance has lost or suffered the keys & privileges of the Priesthood to be taken away from them & they left to wander in darkness and practice all manner of wickedness untill thousands became the vessals of wrath & were doomed to destruction for as long as menare without the Priesthood they continue to wander from God & never retrace their steps untill it is done by the priesthood, & the Idea of the Saints being led by fals Prophets is just a notion accor-ding to the light in which they view them all the fals prophets we have are men who have turned aside from the truth.The man is the head & God of the woman, but let him act like a God in virteous principles & God like conversation, walk and deportment & such men will continue to gain influence & power and advance in glory to all eternity. But should they use there power in wickedness as a tyrant they soon will be called to render an account of their stewardship. if not found worthy they will be hurled down to perdition & their family & kingdom be given to another that is more worthy. Some say that a woman cannot be saved without a man, neither can a man without a woman. Br Joseph said he had taught the Twelve all that he knew concerning the order of the kingdom but the difficulty was they could not remember it as he told them, but when it was necessary they would not be at a loss for under-standing; & I bear record to the truth of his word before God this day that I always had an understanding & evry thing was brought to my mind just as he taught them to us. All the ordinances of the Temple & building of the Alter &c. came to me just right when they were to be attended to & could we now know Br Hyde, Pratt & Taylor's feelings you would say that they could read a man through as soon as they cast there eyes upon him.The Apostle Paul while speaking of the Fathers & the Ancients said that thay without us could not be made perfect there was a lack in his day & still will be to all eternity untill the chain of that Priesthood is restored & evry spirit take a taber-nacle that was fore ordained according to the dispensation of the will of God. I am entitled to the Keys of the Priesthood according to linage & blood, so is Brother H. C. Kimball & many others have taken Kingly power & grades of the Priesthood. this we would have taught in the Temple if time had permitted. Joseph Smith was entitled to the Keys of the Priesthood according to blood still he was the fourth son. But when we get anot[h]er Temple built then we will teach you concerning these thingssuffice it to say that I will extend the chain of the Prist-hood back through the Apostolic dispensation to Father Adam just as soon as I can get a temple built. Jesus could have restored the order of the Pristhood in his day & brought in the Millenium if the people would have harkened to his inst-ructions but they rebelled & would not, & it was for this cause that Jesus told them that all the blood that had been shed from righteous Abel down to Zechariah the Prophet should be required at there hands.I have a request to make of my family & that is that they (esspecially old people) omit calling me their Father. Call me Brother Brigham. I shall feel better when you do 
 for I do not consider that I am worthy of that appelationFather in the Priesthood implies the great head, the term would be proper to Father Adam. Jesus had reference to the same thing when He told his deciples not to call any man Father on earth for their Father was in heaven.The seal of the covenant that I have been speaking off to day was what the Apostle saw previous to the destruction of the wicked when the Angel was commanded not to fear pour out the vials of wrath on the wicked untill the saints were sealed in thereir forehead & when this was done they all became FatherAdams family. Those that are adopted into my family & take me for their councellor if I continue faithful I will preside overthem throughout all Eternity. I will stand at their head, and Joseph will stand at the head of this Church & will be there President Prophet & God to the People in this dispensation. when we Locate I will settle my family down in the order & teach them there duty they will then have to provide temporal blessings for me instead of my boarding from 40 to 50 persons as I now do. I will administer in spiritual blessings to them. I expect to live in the house of the Lord & recieve & administer ordinan-ces to my brethren & for the dead all the year round.President H. C. Kimball arose & addressed the meeting at some moments. Bore testimony that what President Young had said was true & rejoiced to meet with them &c.Br O. Pratt also addressd the meeting a few momentsbore testimony to the truth & also rejoiced to meet withthem. There was then an intermission untill after supperThe table was well furnished & supplyed. 40 persons could be seated at the Table at a time. the men were seated to the right with there companion oposite them. commencing with the Twelve President Young at there head. then in order the adopted children begining with the 1st that was adopted. the band & choir kept their seats, & continued there sweet strains of music while the guest were partaking of the rich festival. While at the table Brother Thomas Wolsay & John ^H.^ Tippets entered the house they came direct fromt the from the Mormon Battalion 280 miles south of Santa fe on the River Riogrand on the 10th of Nov 1847. they piloted 56 sick men to Fort Purbolo whare Capt Brown esstablishment were stationed from there came in on Pack Mules were 50 days on the way. were taken prisoners twice by the Indians, once was sentenceed to death by the Pawnees were 30 days without bread & 5 days without much of any thing to eat. Brought a package of 137 lettersbrought good account from fort Purbulow but rather unfavorable from the Battalion their faces were covered with hair & there persons resembled a mountaineer. it was a miracle that the lives of the men were saved from the Indians & cold. They were seated to the table in the guarbd they arived in. their arival produced no small stirthrough the camp. men & women came in all directions to enquire after there friends in the Armey. After the men were refreshed we went into council with them & they rehearsed the situation of the Battallion that they had been on half rations for three weeks when they left them & no pro[sp]- [page torn]ects of more than half rations should they attempt to cross [the] [page torn]mountains this winter. However report reached Sant[a fe] [page torn] 
 they arived that the Battalion had taken the Alpasio a strong hold between the Riogrand and the Mountains without thefireing of a gun. if this report is true the Bat[talion] will have an abundance of support & likely take up winter quartersmany other remarks were made & President Young said that if they had harkened to his council not a man of them would have fallen but would have returned to their friends in perfect safety.At 7 oclok we returned to the Council House. found the Saints rejoicing in what had heard through the day. Elder Isaac Morley said that his soul was filled with rejoicing to see the beauty & harmony of the family connecting links of the Priesthood that had been taught this day: And when I look at the family connexion I cannot but acknowledge him my leader in all things & he looking to Joseph the Martered Prophet who has gone to prepare the way for us, and can do more for us than he could do if he was here. This Pristhood spoken off if from all Eternity & will lead to eternity & will exhalt the Saints to be Gods through faithfulness.President Young arose & continued his remarks upon the law of adoption granted the brethren the privilege of asking questions when they did not fully comprehend his meaningThe Lord introduced the law of adoption for the benefit of the children of men as a school master to bring them back into the covenant of the Priesthood. This Principle I am aware is not clearly understood by many of the Elders in this Church at the present time as it will here after be: And I confess that I have had ownly a smattering of those things but when it is necessary I will attain to more knowledge on the subject & consequently will be enabled to teach & practice more andwill in the mean time glorify God the bountiful giver.I have heard Elders say they were not dependant upon any man, I then considerd & do now that it was saying more than I can say, for I consider that we are all dependant one upon another for our exhaltation & that our interestis inseperably connected. (for example) what can my familydo without me supposing they were to all turn away from meI hold the Keys over them through which they are to receivethere exhaltation. would they would not be like sheep without a shepherd & would be devoured by the wolves, they certainly would. then let us change the position, & say that I would cut off all my family, then what glory would I have with nobody to rule over but my own dear little self. To tell you my feelings I would rather be annihilated than to be in that situation. Thisis another strong proof of the Apostles saying when they declaired that they without us could not be made perfect. Neither can you without me nor I without you be made perfect ie if we are faithful & without faithfulness there is no perfection on any consideration. This rule applyes to the whole human family. This is the torment & misery of the disobedient spirits that they cannot be made perfect, unless some scheme should hereafter be introduced for their redemption. they are now without tabernacles to dwell in ownly such as they have taken possession off unlawfully [page torn] usurped power over. it being a part of their agency that was [page torn] [bes]towed them which they used to the consumation of there unhappy [page torn] [w]retched estate, it being the reward & fruits of there doings 
 having been given over to all manner of wickedness perm-itted to afflict the handy work of the Lord untill theyfill up the cup of their iniquity & the Lord sayeth unto them thou wicked & disobedient spirit thou shalt not have power any longer to afflict my people or destroy the works of my hands, you have forfeited your agency & wrought thy fulness, depart hence to the pit that I have prepared for thee, & this is there torment, that thereir power & agency is taken away. they are left to regret that it wasthrough their own disobediance that they cut the thread of there own salvation: the reflections of which ownly serve to torture & increase there torment & that would be the situation of my family should they cut themselves off from me. I use my family for an example, not that I have the least fears of their ever doing so, for I have none. I feel happy this night because we are of one mind, still should I believe that we were perfect & could not advance any further I should not be happy but to the honor power & glory of the faithful there is no end.For your satisfaction I will show you a rule by which you may comprehend the exhaltation of the faithful. I will use myself as a figure, & say that I am ruling over 10 sons or subjects[page torn] [o]wnly & soon each one of them would have 10 men sealed to them & they would be ruler over them & that would make me ruler over 10 Presidents or Kings whareas I was [page torn] [r]uler over 10 subjects ownly or in other words I ruledover one Kingdom but now I rule over 10. then let each one get 10 more then I would be ruler over 100 Kingdoms& so on continued to all eternity & the more honor & glory thatI could bestow upon my sons the more it would add to my exhaltations. but to clip the thread of your exhaltation then whare would be your your glory: it would be like the fallen angels or devils that kept not their first esstate but were reservedin everlasting chains of darkness unto the judgment of the great day others fell from heaven were thrust down to hell; but if wyou wish to advance hold up the hands of your file leader & boast him a head. should you have ten legions of trains following on after you, you should say to your fileleader push ahead for I am coming with my train boosting him up at the same time instead of trying to pass by himthis would stimulate him & he would say come on myboys I will travel as fast as you can & on we would go in one solid train to all Eternity. Before I close I will answer one question that has been asked me repetedly. Should I [page covered] h[av]e a father dead that has never herd this gospel, would it [page covered] [b]e required of me to redeem him & have him adoptedto some mans family and I be adopted unto my Fatheranswer No. If we have to attend the ordinances of rede-[page torn] [m]ption for our dead relatives we then become their saviors [page torn] [&] were we to wait to redeem our dead relatives before we [page torn] c[o]uld link the chain of the Priesthood we would never[page torn] [a]ccomplish it. Many other remarks were made & while [page torn] [a]ddressing the females said Sisters if you expect to call me [page torn] Br Brigham I want you to be cleanly keep your faces, hands[page torn] [&] skin clean from head to foot your clothes dishes & houses [page torn] [cl]ean also your children & teach them manners. & when [page torn] [y]ou mix up Bread dont have a dozen flies in your tray 
 I know that the women generally rule there husbands & the children their Mothers. But when a woman under-takes to rule me I want her to be so secret about it that I cannot catch her at it. Now I do not want the brethrenfrom my remarks to abuse thereir wives, but treat them kindly: do there heavy luging but dont wash there dishes as some men do. At the close of the remarks there was a little exercise by music & dancing & the meeting was dismisedFebruary 17, 1847 ~ Wednesday17th The family meeting of President Young met again to day but Br Young himself spent an exceding sick daywas taken in the night & suffered much.

 It is the most singular river I ever beheld. it is from a quarter to half a mile wide & its shores & bed one universall body of quick sand it is a rapid stream yet many places a person can wade across it frequently nearly the whole bed of the river is covered with but few inches of water & at other places it is deep & rapid not withstanding it is quick sand horses & cattle can walk down to edge of the river & drink like walking on the edge of a smooth sea beach & some times while walking on the apparent hard beach or bed of the river a man or horse will sudd-enly sink into the quick sand & the more he struggles to get out the more he will sink & will soon perish ofassistance is not near, whare many horses & men have been lost in this way on the Platt. whare we have spent the Sabbath a man could nearly wade acrossthe river. we do not travel on Sunday but pitch our tents Saturday night or encamp in the waggons & we do not move untill monday morning this is theorder of the campApril 19, 1847 ~ Monday19th It was quite cool in the morning. the bugle blew at 5 for prayers & 7 for starting we travled two abrest men walked by the side of their wagons, we bore a notherly direction untill about noon when we reached the north bend of the Platt.

Br Little brought many things that the Colonel Kane sent as presents to the 12 & others I recieved a. stop box Marriners compass small enough to carry in the pocket it was a splendid present. May the blessings of God be upon the head of Col Cane for his good feelings towardsthe servants of God. during thi we camped at night near a grove of timber on the bank of the Plattwe formed a circle from edge to edge of the bank of the river the river on one side was our defencewe drove the tongues of our waggons out ward & fore wheel of each waggon was placed against the hind wheel of the waggon before it and all thehorses & cattle taken inside the circle so that we weresecure against the Indians. the river was about onemile wide whare we camped & on the north side joinin-g our encampment it was deep & rapid, the face of the country during to days travel was on the south side of the river high bluffs runing precpeitately to the river on the north side which we travled a level prairie without any bluffs about 2 miles from the river a rise of table land about 10 feet & continues of a levelno timber except patches on the river soil sandy 22 mi 
 April 20, 1847 ~Tuesday20th A hard wind through the night. this morning fair but strong SW wind it covers our waggons with sand & dust while journeying the soil is universallysandy on the banks of the Platt the grass is now about 4 inch high scattering not half feed. their are many waterfowls about the Platt such as ducks geesebrant but the most numerous of all are the sand Hill Cranes which flye in large flocks on evry side of us. 25 minutes past 7 we started on our Journey, 2 1/2 miles came to another grove of small& large cottonwoods covering about 40 acres, it was about 5 miles to the table land which was now rising into a bluff. Herethe road runs 20 degrees south of west bending to S by W, one mile in which distance we passed 3 Islands in the Platt covered with timber the largest about 10 acres & their continues a chain of Islands for miles on the river & some timber on the south side of the Platt. we came to shell creek 3 miles from our encampment 1 1/2 miles to the right of shell creek is a prairie dog village covering about 6 acres of ground. this Creek is timbered ownly by a few scattering willows the river runs about parallel with the river its general barings are abouc east & west after crossing the shell creek bridge the road runsabout S.W by W 60 degres west of south for about 15 milesthe Platt is skirted with timber. Professer Pratt & myself went forward of the company to take observation we traveledabout 13 miles & stoped bated horses took observations &cwhile on the road we freequently see gopher hills fromone to 6 feet in circumference diamiter & from 3 inch to2 feet in highth some resembling a potatoe patch whichmakes it rough waggoning over them with the exception of this it is the best road on the north side of the Platt river I ever travled being a level dry hard road. our standard Thermometer stood to day at 1 oclok  94°, / thecompany approached us & we continued on 5 mile & the whole encampment came up & we encamped for the nightin a circle, cut down cotton wood trees to feeds the horses on the bark they will knaw off the bark from brouse limbs & sticks 10 inches through as readily as they would eat corn we have had to feed upon cotton wood all the way thus far we give each horse also about 2 quarts of corn per day. Our fisherman drew a net this afternoon& broat into camp 213 fish Buffalo & Carp which was divided in the Camp we had a Buffalo would weigh 10 lbsa Carp 2 lbs & had a good supper.

 through the encampment & then returned with us the road runs 20 degrees south of west 7 miles then turned 10 dgress North of west at half past 12 we came in sight of 70 Indian Horses & Mules soon we came in sight of a large Pawnee Indian village on the north side of the lou fork & also a large one on the south side of it. we drove on by the villages & they soon began to sally out to come to us. we camped in a half moon the bank of the river forming a parallel line in front the indians to the number of about 200 on the south side of the river came down to the shore some waided over about 75 came into camp including the grand Chief of the Nation with many war chiefswe met them before we left the ground & made them presents of about 4 lbs of tobacco 15 lbs lead powder fish hooks beads flour salt &c but still they were not satisfied considering our numbers they thought they ought to have had more & when we left the ground they appeared vary dissatisfied we however harnessed up our teams & drove on to looking glass creek & camped at its mouth for the night upon the bank of the loop fork after our horses were turned out we were called together & in consequence of the dissatisfaction of the Indians a guard of 100 men was called for the quorum of the Twelve with nearly the whole camp volunteered to stand guard one half the fore part of the night & the other the latter part we had a picket guard also of 5 men & mules at a time I with my mule was on picket guard. we had hard wind & rain in the afternoon which continued a part of the time while I was on guard I rolled myself up in my buffalo & let the wind & rain beat onto me we were releaved at about 1 oclok & went to rest. But no Indians appeared during the nightApril 22, 1847 ~ Thursday22 we crossed the looking glass 15 minutes to 9, & then continued a westerly course there were a good many auter on the looking glass. we arived at Beaver Creek at 12 oclok there are some Beaver on this creek ^about one mile above its mouth^ Professor Pratt took the meridian observation of the sun by the sextant for the Lat which wasfound to be 41° 25' 15". Also found the magnetic needle to vary about 12 degrees east. And found the barometer at half past 12, 28. 711, the attached Thermometer standing at 68° and the detached thermometer at 67° & also took an observation of the sun for the ^true^ time in the morning it is 10 miles between the two creeks which we travled this forenoon. we crossed Beaver creek at half past 2 oclok, the road runs about south west. the water was about to the deds [beds] of our wagg-ons it was a rough steep bank to come out of about 12 men hitched a hook & roap to the tongue of each waggon & puled them up; Beaver Creek is lined with scattering timber cottonwood & willows, we travled 7 miles & came to the Pawnee Mishionary station & camped for the night the road was Bluff was skirted with some 
 Oaks on the North side of the road in the hills, we kept out a gard through the night as we were in danger of the Sioux on one side, and the Pawnees on the otherPresident Young addressed the Camp. & told them when they left in the morning not to take away any thing ownly what they brought with them unless it was sold them by Brother Case who had had charge of the Station for a long time & the goverment was owing him a good deal & if he felt disposed to sell any thing that he had in his possession & report to Goverment he could do so. during the evening Professer Pratt took made some observation at 15 m pas 7 oclok the barometer stood at 28.7 inches attached Thermometer 64° detached Thermometer 60° North wind & fairthe same Also at 8 oclok 52 m found the double altitude of the pole star to be 80° 20' 35" from which the lattitude was deduced viz. O, Pratt. Also took the angular distance of sun & moon for the Longitude at Beaver Creek ford also the altitude of the moon for the tru timeApril 23, 1847 ~ Friday23rd At 6 oclok O Pratt made a barometrical observationmercury standing at 28.697 inch attached Thermometer 36° detached thermometer 34° vary little wind from west fair. Also took an altitude of the sun for the time, and also A Meridan Altitude of the sun for the latitude found it to be 41° 24' 29". While wattering the horses at a creek at the station last evening Brother G. A. Smiths horse mired & pitched foreward & Jumped onto him trod upon his feet & breast & held him fast in the mud untill I caught him by the bit & backed him off I was fearful he was badly injured but at last found that he was but little hurt[FIGURE] This was a day of adventures to the pioner camp in the morning 12 of us started on horsback to search out a ford across the dangerous difficult & troublesom loup fork of the Patt river we went down the stream some distance & several men waided across the stream & found the water so deep & so much quick sand we concluded to drive Hier up to the old Pawnee village so we returned to the camp harnessed up our horses, my gray horse named Titus had the belly ake or bots yet I started out with him & the camp drove up with some little difficulty to the old Indian village or a little below it & men commenced searching out a ford & found the whole bed of the river one universal dody [body] of quick sand which if a horse or waggon stoped it would begin to sink down we had two channels of water to cross with a sand bar in in the middle the deepest water was from 3 to 4 feet deedp & vary rapid & about 300 ^yards^ strait across some places of quick sand was found so soft as to sink man or beast instantly in & the more he strugled to get out the more he would sinkbut we calculated to avoid such places as much as possibleAs I was forward with my 10 or the first ten it fell to me to make the trial professor Pratt having a strong pair of horses went forward and I followed him I had two yoke of cattle & my horses on my carriage with about 10 hundred 
 on I immediately saw as soon as I started that the cattle didbut little good were slow & in the way we would stop & bgin to sink I Jumped out of my carriage into the water upto my waist about 10 men came to my assistance with a drag roap & hitched to the oxen & assisted me in getting across the first stream but with great difficulty I stoped on a sand bar out of water my horses & waggon im-mediately began to sink & by treading the ground a little it would become a perfect quagmire. but though we were sinking in it the men had to leave the waggon whare it was for O Pratt in trying to cross the second stream had sunk into a bed of quick sand and all men had to go to his relief to get his horses & waggon out the horses were taken from the waggons the load taken out & carried to shore byhand & the waggon drawn out by by the help of menI took off a part of my load or most of it in a boat & went through the second stream empty & got out two other waggons done in the same way but it was so terri-fic the rest of the camp would not follow suit. so theirwere 6 men of us in all to spend the night to gether without horses & waggons to guard against the whole Pawnee band that were camped below us on the same side of the river should they feel disposed to come upon us, there numbers were not knownbut it was supposed they numbered over 600 warriors, we divided our company which made ownly three of us on guard at a time Br Pack O. Pratt & myself went on guard thefore part of the night although I had been in the water during the afternoon I stood guard in my wet clothing one half the night & slept in them the other half, we had not more than got our position for the night untill we were joined by 5 men who crossed the river in a boat were sent over by President Young to assist us which made eleven meninstead of 6 so we divided our force accordingly. the night past off in peace & no disturbance. distance from theMissionary station to the ford 4 miles 4 milesApril 24, 1847 ~ Saturday24th A plesant morning Professor Pratt took an observation on the south bank of the fording place on the loup fork 4 miles from the Missionary station, took a meridian observation of the sun for the Lattitude found to be to cross the ^41° 22' 37".^ The camp now wer busiy in concocking plansto cross the river the[y] drew together timber & rails to build two rafts & began to put it together but some of the Breth-ren made another trial to cross with waggons by putting on several hors & mule teame they went a little hier upthan we did & got over with much less difficulty & themore the ground was trod in the water the smother & harder it grew, so the whole encampment turned there waggonsback to the ford & abandoned the raft & by unloading one half of there baggage could cross in safety & the whole encampment came over in that way by doubling teams & going back & forth untill all were over each captain with his ten assisted each other over, & so in this way all Israel who were present went over (not Jordan)but the Loup fork of the Platt river in safety without damage to man or beast & we felt thankful in our hearts 
 to our God for his mercies unto us & that we were on the south side of the river. we all loaded up our waggons& drove 4 miles & camped for the Sabbath on the bank of the stream After our waggons were placed the Twelve & took a walk on the high table land to make observations with our glasses of the sourrounding country. Professor Pratt made a barometrical observationat this place at 15 m past 7. Barometer stood at 28.56 inch attached Thermometer 564° detached Thermometer 61°.5April 25, 1847 ~ Sunday25th Sunday a plesant morning. The order of the camp is that there be no fishing, hunting or labour of any kind on Sunday except such as is actually necessary. 4 antelope appeared before us on the plain on the opposide side of the river we could see them with the naked eye but far more clearly through our spy glasses, there sides & belly were white & backs brown these were the first antelope I ever saw. about 10 oclok also 4 Elk appeared on the opposite side of the river which we looked at with ourglasses these were the first Elk also I ever saw. the day was mostly spent in resting man & beast untill 4 oclok, the camp gathered together for a meeting & were addressed by a number of the Brethren among whome was G. A. Smith & B. Young who spoke upon principle upon breaking off the yoke from the saints some pretended to say that the Twelve were oppressing the People but is it so no, but if most men that are on the earth those in the Church not excepted should rule & lead this Church they would have many yokes put upon them that we are all the while trying to take off their shouldiers. many other good things were saidthe guards were placed out as usual to guard the camp during the evening a company of hunters were appointed to go foreward of the camp to ketch game there were 7 hors-eman & 10 footman the quorum of the Twelve also had the privilege of Joining the hunters when they please. ^A^ Meriardian Alt of the sun gave for the Lat 41° 20' 31".April 26, 1847 ~ Monday26th Early in the morning before the break of day 2 Indians crept upon their hands & knees approaching the camp to steal some horses they got within 3 rods of the guard before they were discovered. they first thought them to be wolves & snaped ^at^ them they rose up & run & two of the guard fired at them & 4 others rose up out of the grass making 6 in all the bugle was sounded and all arose up to arms not know-ing but there was a large party nearby but we saw no more. I started out in the morning with the hunterswe saw 8 deer 4 antelope but caught nothing we travled 8 miles & camped for noon, on the opposite side of the river we saw through our glasses the relicks of an old Indian town. we saw 8 trails leading to it with 6 & 8 abrest each in the afternoon we travled we travled 7 miles & camped on clear creek with a hard gravel bottom the first one of the kind we had met with on the road. we killed one wild goose & saw fresh buffalo signs 
 whare we camped this was the first signs of the kind we had seen on the road. the travels to day was like a level desert except except the dividing ridge betwen the two rivers the grass was dry & sandy mostly level & nearly without water we travled to day from 10 to 20 degrees west of south we camped under a high bluff in a half moon Brs Young, Kimball, Richard's, & myself went on to a high bluff to view the country yust [just] at dusk a tremendious alarm was given thro-ugh the camp that Indians had cralled up & taken Porter Rockwell & his horse & made off with him many men mou-nted there horses & made off with ^after^ him with all speed but it was soon discovered that Rockwell was in the camp but two horses were gone Dr Richards & Br Littles & about 20 men mounted & armed went in search of the horses but found them not it was believed the Indians took off the horses 15 milesdistance of the day.

Teachpeople to controll themselves teach good doctrin & practice itHere is the place to become a polished shaft I like to remanhere to see you to be with you. I want to say to the Elders ofIsrael ofwere you ordained to preach the gospel if so it is notwisdom or prudent to mingle with the excesses of the wicked or in any of their exercises for then the devil willhave no advantage over you I mingle with the Saints herein thei recreations & exercises but let me go abroad & subjectmyself to mingle with the wicked I am on the Devils ground& subject myself to him. If I mingle with any company herefor recreation I controll that company but if I step ontothe Devils ground He controlls it. remember then at all timesthat what you do do it in the name of the Lord & let all youracts be to do the will of God it is so that a man could notexercise his privileges because of the tradition of the world allChristians would think it a great sin to have a Fiddle 
 they would say it is wicked to have music they have made it a sin I have not put a desire in my heart for music, but the Lord has. Music will calm the ferocious beasts who caused this the Lord. I want to say a few words about tithing you now what was said at the last confernc the Saints have done more during the last 7 months than in 7 years before I feel to bless you call upon this people to put their all upon the Alter & they will do it I feel like aFather to this people. No mother can love Her babe more thanI do this people. when you do wrong I feel oppressed in spi[ri]t & the Lord is grieved I feel to urge it upon you all to sceace to do evel & learn to do righ all that we have is the Lords He does as He pleases the Thrones & kingdoms of the world are all governed by him & in the End all will be found right & they will find they have an agency unto themselves & all will do as they please if they do right they will be saved get Glory & Exaltation & the wicked will go to Hellthere is no place whare God is not find Empty space & there the Lord will not be.[FIGURE] I will now preach you another Sermon their is one great Master inand Head in all kingdoms & governments So with our Father in Heaven is a Tabernacle He created us in the likeness of his own image. The Son has also a Tabernacle like the Father & the Holy Ghost is a minister to the people but not a tabernacle who begat the Son of God Infidels say that Jesus was a Bastard but let me tell you the truth concerning that matter. Our Father begat all the spirits that were bef[or]e any tabernacles we[r]e made when our Father came into the Garden He came width his celestial body & brought one of his wifes with him & eat of the fruit of the garden untill He could beget a tabernacle and Adam is Michael or God and all the God that we have any thing to do with they Eat of this fruit & formed the first Tabernacle that was formed and when the VIRGIN MARY was begotton with child it was by the Father and in no other way inno other way ownly as we were begotton I will tell you the Truth as it is in God. The world dont know that Jesus Christ Our Elder Brother was begotton by our Father in Heaven Handle it as you please it will either seal the damnation or salvation of man He was begotton by the Father & not by the Holy Ghost. When you go to Preach & believe that Jesus Christ was begotton by the Holy Ghost dont lay Hands upon the Heads of Females for the reception of the Holy Ghost lest it Beget her with Child and you be accused I have told you nothing in this thing but what you have red in the Bible I do not frame it.The President then refered to the tithing & said if one quartor of the Tithing money that was due had been paid we should have had more means the merchanets have carried away $200,000 to the States did the people pay tithing on that Nonow Bishops se[e] to this matter & then see what your feelings would be if you was in my place & see the Hundreds that call upon me & my Brethren if the Tithing was paid that is due we would have enough to pay all debts I now say to the Bishops go to my yard & take all my stok & lick all up clean then do the same by my Brethren untill all the debt are paid All voted to follow the presidents example

Woodruff President Kimball called for Professor A Carrington but made the following remarkyou have learned Enough to know know that the spirit of God will be grieved at any folly manifest in the House of God Angels are ministering spirits to those who are heirs of salvation but when you do wrong the Angels of the Lord will leave and the Angels of the devil will take there place & keep their company then you are on dangerous ground & if you will not hear the prophets that God sends unto you you would not hear the Angels of God some have said that I was vary presumptuous to say this Brothor Brigham was my God & Savoiour Brothe Joseph was his God the one that gave Joseph the keys of the kingdom was his God which was Peter Jesus Christ was his God & the God & Fathe of Jesus Christ was Adam. The Lord wants us to have wisdom to circumscribe the Earth do you not suppose that God has pleasure in seeing this people who are the weak things of the Earth to confound the wise Noble & great some will tell the gentiles all that transpires among usBrothe Joseph Young followed with a few remarks[FIGURES] A Carrington was then called to the Stand who arose & said I rejoice with you my Brethren in the blessings you enjoy yes I rejoice with you. Brother Kim-ball sayes that what I say will be right. All science that is in the world that is not consistant with reason & demonstration is false. But all that is truth is good no matter who has it. with regard to Education we are all interested in it yet we have different views of it. Their is three things that are hard to speak upon 1st is a dinner speech 2nd is a Temperance speech 3rd is a speechon Education I despise that vain phylosophy that puffeth up. I do not know of any truth that does not belong to salvation that is of worth evry thing that is knowledge pertains to salvation we have come unto the work and have to save ourselves our Children & our progenitors I dont know of any thing that we can do to lay a foundation for this better than to disipline the mind & Body & bring them both in subjection to the mind & will of God the ownly way we can do rightis to keep the commandments of God. One of the command[ment]s of God require us to multiply & replenish the Earth when a young man gets married to a good young woman & the Hunny moon is over and a foundation laid for posterity then the man begins to scold his wife the wife gets the same spirit & this goes to the child this is an Evil & foll[ows] the child through life. The Blood nurses the embrio & as the child grows the Evil increases with the childthe Hunny moon should last always & the Husband should gratify the wife in all things that she righteously wishes asfar as he can & the mother should possess a spirit of contentm[ent] & peace at least untill the child leaves the Breast then you 
 will see a Noble Tabernacle for a Noble spirit to dwell in the spirits in Eternity have their times & seasons would not a Noble spirit rather take a Noble Tabernacle than a poor one when many children are born they cannot suck the breast because of the corruption of their parents this is probably the fault of the Doctors for not teaching the female as they ought to be taught & when the child is born the practice has been to give it a Brandy tody or Chamber lie while the breast is the place for the child let the child have the milk & let let such foolery alone dont play with the tabernacles of your children or treat them foolishly but treat them in wisdom you dont see any body giving a Brandy Tody or chamber lye & they do well to follow the course of natureThe gentile Doctors cannot cure deseases they do not knowhow I will prove it to you the old school give medicine by the shovel full. The New school will not give a pill as large as the smallest Bird shot. is their any Equality in this I say down with the whole system I have no use for them next comes the Hdrapath the water cures well even water is not to be trifled with look at the foolery & the difference of the doctors it is much better to follow out the natural law in all things than to trust to them who would ever think of giving such a dose to a calf as they would give a childTheir is no such children as the Latter day Saints If we cannot do what we want to our children may if we cannot get back to the primeval platformbecaus of the primeval platfor iniquity of our Fathers still it is our duty to teach them principle & truth when children begin to talk dont teach them baby talk for what you learn the child in that state has to be unl-earned then be careful what you say or do before your children for you would be asstonished at the atte-ntion children pay to what you say. Be sure to take time to teach your children & not neglect it many other interesting remarks were made by Brother Carrington on the occasionBrother G A. Smith followed with interesting remarksPresident B Young next followed & said I want to bear testimony to what Brother Carrington has said he has spoken the truth I thank him for what he has said what he has said is true and if we follow the testimony we will return to the power of our first parents his is the way for the Nations of the Earth to return to God. The Lamanites will be a white & delightsom people through this procedure or principle the Nation of the Earth cannot return to God upon any other principle this kind of teaching is what pleases me the Doctors are ignorant & they teach others to be ignorantswe should understand our organization but the people of this day have lost all good scense they are a set of 
 fools because they have been taught to be fools now have some sens & believe what Brother Carrington has said I now these things are virtueous principles the world are corrupt you have got to be pure in heart or you cannot abide the day that is comingat 2 oclok P. M D H Wells addressed the Saints & bore testimony to the work of GodBrother Wm I Appleby made some remarks conce[rnin]gparents & childrenBrother G. D. Walt next spoke. He said he was the first Baptized in EnglandWm Clayton next spoke & expressed his feelingsBrother Kimball next spoke for a short time & meeting was adjourned till Sunday morningApril 11, 1852 ~ SundaySunday Morning April 11th After singing & prayer BrothKimball addressed the meeting & said the spirit of God would make a humbly man handsome I do not placemy affections upon any thing but God & Jesus Christ you ought to love Brother Brigham enough to keep his commandments so with my family if they love me they will keep my commandments if you want to be a friend to Brother Brigham & his counsellors liveHoly before God & do right & if you will do what you knowyou will do right do by your neighbor as you would wish him to do unto you Some men wanted to get women from their husbands who are dead & get them sealed to them such would rob the dead this is wrong let me do for the dead what they cannotdo for themselves & this is right & the dead will plead for that man to be blessed. Never take a course acourse to rob the dead I will have time to redeem all my dead friends either in time or Eternitythe Malinium will be spent in the Temples of the Lord in Redeeming our dead if my friends will not Receivemy testimony I will let them alone & when theyhave been in Hell long enough I will go & Redeem them I will take a course to get tothe Bless Blessing upon my seed that Adam had upon his seed Joseph had it & I have it if my children sin they will have i to Repent of & pay for it but will be saved in the End. we should not go to law with each other all that will not go to Law say I all said I, I would aslieves be damned without a man as to be damned with a man that would steal a dead mans wife for he will be damned any how. I will say that Broth[er]Hunter is the chief Bishop & he has a right tochose his two counsellors Bishop Hunter arose & made some remarks & said he should choose men 
 that could assist He said Brother Brigham Youngwas at the Head & his councellors were inspired of the Holy Ghost I select for my councellors BrighamYoung & Heber C Kimball. Then Brother Kimball & W Richards laid Hands upon Bishop HuntersHead & blessed him in the following wordsO God the Eternal Father I ask in the name of Jesus Christ while we lay our hands upon thy head that all our words may be dictaited b[y] the Holy spirit while we set apart Brother Hunter as a presiding Bishopwe here by set you apart to be a presiding Bishop & to be a Judge in Israel we bless you with thespirit of your Office & calling you shall have wisdomto Judge between good & Evil in all things & to be a great Benefit to the House of Israel & that they may uphold thee by their faith that thou mayest administer in in faith & righteousness & be a great blessing to the people & administer to the poor & nedythou shalt have desernment like the lightning to detect itevil & those who seek to deceive & that all may receive thy teachings & that thy work may work together for the good of all the people even so AmenBrother Truman Angel was Nominated to continue in his office of Architect for the Church was carried[FIGURE] Brother Kimball said to Brother Brigham you shall be blessed & all your House & not one of them shall be lost & no man shall get betwen me & Brother Brigham & Brothe Richards & no man or woman shall get between the Twelve & Presidency if they do they will get pinched & any man or woman that tries to get between us will be damned they tried to prejudice Josephagainst us in his day & they will be damnedThe Twelve are the best men that live and any man that tries to put their feet upon their neck will get the feet of the Twelve upon their neck(Brother Brigham came in at this time) do as Br Brigham tells you & all will be right & you will not have sorrow follow my council & you will not have sorrow. If my own family would take my council & had faith in me I would never have a doctor in my family but I have doctors here that I have faith in but let me send for a doctor & they have faith in him & not in me then what for them am I. Brother Brigham said that is true & worthy of note it is natural for a man tobe always borrowing trouble but we have trouble enoughwithout borrowing. If you are not one you are not mine saith the Lord but if you abide in me you willbring forth fruit to the glory of God when we learn this lesson our sorrows will scease when we get the cloak off we shall be in heaven In this 
 House is my Heaven for I am in a heavenly place with Holy men & Angels The Bishop with Brothe Hunterare good men. Seth Taft was appointed a travellingBishop others were spoken off as travelling BishopsI have been talking about the union in the world their would be a patition between the different Branches but in the kingdom of God it is not so but they areall united. If I hier a man to work I want himto be faithful in all things evry man should earn allthey can & labour all they are able to do & not over labourI believe a man should be paid according to what they earn as God rewards men according to their worksThe old Lions neck is out of the yoke & they will not put it on again for Brother Brigham shall whip them out & they shall not whip him out nor me normy Brethren. you shall be blessed & the Earth shallbring forth for your good & your shlall be blessed in your posterity And I say it in the name of Jesus ChristBrother Brigham said it was a prophesy & was trueConference was Adjurned untill the special confencin AugustApril 12, 1852 ~ Monday to April 23, 1852 ~ FridayFrom this conference till Friday Apriail 23rd I spent the time at home doing my spring work & preparing to go on our Journey to the South On this day April 23rdI left the City of the great Salt Lake & rode to dry creek in Utah through a snow storm & spent the night in company with Brother Nobles on the Bank of the creek 30 milesThe object of this Journey was to accompany the presidency to visit the Southern settlements & explore as far as we had an opportunityApril 24, 1852 ~ Saturday24th we rode Held a meeting rode to Hobble Creek wentforth in the dance with the saints in that place distance of the day 25 mlsApril 25, 1852 ~ Sunday25 Sunday we held a meeting at the school House the people were addressed by O pratt was followed by B Young H.

 September 12, 1852 ~ Sunday[FIGURE] Sept 12th Sunday 12th O Pratt Preached the Funeral serm[on]of Lorenzo D. Barnes & Wm Burton who had died inEngland & were buried there but their bodies were takenup & brought to the vally of the great Salt Lake & buried with dead Saints in this place. The follow is a synopsis of the discours[FIGURES] L.D.B W.B.Elder Orson Pratt arose & said the subject before us this morning is one that fills my mind withmany reflections I think the Elders of this Church & kingdom do not improve their time as they should but are to slow intreasure up knowledge as God has commanded us to dowe shall want all the knowledge we can obtain whenwe go to the nations of the Earth & visit evry circle of the learned to teach them the plan of salvation if we have improvedour time we can bring forth out of the treasures of our hearts things new and old. The subject before me to day is the remains of Lorenzo D. Barnes & Wm Bartonthe question might arise what benefit could it be to those Brethren to be brought from their Graves in a foreign country & be buried with the saints here. I do not thinkit would be a great advantage to them in the Eternal worldI had as lieves to be buried in Asia or Africa as with the the Saints here as far as my Eternal interest is consernedbut aside from this it is a great pleasure both to the living & the dead to know that our bodies will be brought to Zion from the Ends of the Earth to be laid with the saints & then to be raised with them so that he can strike hands with his relatives first & then with the saintsinstead of being thousands of miles apart & having towaft himself thousands of miles through the air to meetwith his brethren. An Immortal being can take himself up into the heavens as Jesus Christ did whenhe was raised from the dead He went to heaven So itmight be with them. How long would it take for BrotherBarnes & Burton to waft themselves to the bosom of the ChurchNot long whare will be the bosom of the Church in theclouds above the Earth before the wicked are diestroyedthe Lord will be in the Air & all the saints with him of allgenerations and He will desend to earth & will bring all the Saints with him. At what speed would the Saints travel we are told that light is the power that governs all thingsif the saints travel as fast as light they would go at the rate of 200000 miles in a second. God can go as fast as lightand He has made the saints and I am led to conclude that they can travel as fast as light for they have got to go on missions to far distant worlds and if they did not go as fast as light they would be a long time on their way spending their time without doing any good if this is the case I had as lieves lay my body down abroad as at home as it wouldnot take more than a second to meet with the Saints I say this to encourage the Elders who are going abroad some may die abroad some may Seal their testimony with their Blood. The Elders should take Heed & not break the comma-ndments of God if they were to commit adultery after 
 receiving their Endowments they cannot be forgiven but must be destroyed in the flesh & his spirit given to the buffiting of Satan untill the first ResurrectionHow long it will be from the morning till evening I am not able to say but after the day of redemption He will come forth and inherit all the blessings that were sealed upon his head no power can take them from him If he has been sealed to any womanthrones powers Dominions or Kingdoms or any other blessing He will inherit them to all Eternity if they do not shed innocent Blood. The scripturesspeak of these same subjects. Paul while speaking to the Corinthian Churches speaks of delivering a certain one to the buffiting of Satan that they may be destroyed in the flesh that their spirits may be saved in the dayof the Lord Jesus Christ. we will now speak of David who had a numerous family that was given himHe finally took Uriah wife put Uriah at the Head of the Battle & He was slain. Here He lost all right to the celestial Glory His wives Thrones Kingdoms & Eternal  lives All had vanished He Just escapes Hell & that is allHe will be a servant to somebody perhaps Uriah for the Gods in Eternity will want servants to greece their carriages makes crowns & Robes &c they will be Gods & want servants. All may be capaciated to become Gods but all will not keep the Laws whareby they may become Gods. Peter spoke of a people who had shed inocent Bloo & drew the Blood of the Savior they were told to repent that they might be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus Christ. There was a chance forthem as they did not know the Priesthood or the fulness of the gospel if they had know it they would not have been forgiven. We will now speak of Brother LorenzoD. Barnes He was faithful but died before he receivedthe fulness of the gospel He had no Thrones, wivesor any thing els of that kind sealed upon [him] what shall we do for him any thing that we do for ourselveswhen we get a temple built such men willloose nothing for they will be Judged by the same laws that we are and they have a chane either in timeor Eternity to receive all we have. for all that would have received it here will receive it there for all men will be Judged like men in the flesh for all mankind will have an Equal privilege there cannot be any baptismEndowments or Ordinances in the spirit world performed but we shall be called to perform in a Temple of the Lord all the ordinances for the dead the same as for the living all things will be sealed to the End of all thingspreparitory to the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ whether they be appertaining to Thrones, kingdoms, families or anything Els pertaining to Earth or Heaven time or Eternity. when we fully consider our duty we shall not be at Ease in Zion or spend our time to make farms & Houses orchards & vineyards for ourselves alone. But we should go to work to build up Zion & a Temple & do the great work of our God wo to themthat are at ease in Zion but wake up & do the work of our God

 [the promises] made to Abraham He brought up the Catholics & showed they were not the Ones for their Priesthood had not the privilege of Either wives or children and the greates blessing to Abraham consisted in his seed & posterity It could not be the protestants they did allow one wife to be sure but no more so when they come to the kingdom of God and find Abram Isaac & Jacob there with their many wives concubines & children there they the protistant Christian Nations if they had power would cast out those patriarchs out of the kingdom for having more wives than one & concubines & many children & for having the Names of which they would call their Bastard children written on the Gates of of the New Jerrusalem they would point the finger of scorn at these things so they would not agree. But when we come tothe Latter Day Saints we find them the ownly people on Earth that suit the case exactly in evry respect and they are the the kingdom of God & hold the keys of that kingdom & they fell disposed to honor & respect their Father Abraham & their children & desire to render unto Israel all that belongs unto themHe was followed by O Hyde & W.

The Meeting opened by prayer by President Orson Hyde who is president of the Twelve Apostles. The names of the Twelve who were present were O Hyde P. P. Pratt W. Woodruff J. Taylor G. A Smith A Lyman C. C. Rich E. T Benson L Snow E. Snow & F D RichardsPresident Orson Hyde made some appropriate remarks upon the rare & eventful occasion upon which we are now met He offered up a fervent prayer & Thanksgiving to God for his blessings that had been over us in our separation & in bring-ing us together & asked for all needful blessings to qualify us for our futur labours untill we arive in the celestial kingdom of God He then said he did not feel like making a long speech but merely interchanging our harty congratulations in ackno-wledgeing the mercy & blessings of GodP. P. Pratt expressed his feelings and after happily refering to our vast separetion & merciful reunion said this is the first opportunity we have had of being together as a quorum & feeling that each member has the most implicit confidence in evry member of the quorum of the Twelve & also in each member of the Presidency who presides over us. I feel as though the day is not far distant when men will stand among us in their Immortal Bodies holding the keys of death & Hell & that Brother Joseph would say if he was a[mo]ng us that we had suffered enough & that we should be numbered among his Jewels He alluded to the great work we had to per-form, the building of a Temple &cW. Woodruff next spoke & expressed his feelings upon the subj-ect of this meeting of the Twelve Apostles a blessing which he never before enjoyed in his life. As he never had met 
 with Eleven of the Twelve Apostles. He considered there had never been but two bodies of men since the days of Adam who had met under such peculier & interesting circumstances & those were the Twelve Apostle with Jesus in Jerrusalem & the Twelve Apostle with Jesus in Ameri[c]a we know their History & works & we know our own & they are three events of great importance to the salvation of the world. He refered to the peculiar & strik-ing fact that there had never been a death in the quorum of the Twelve Apostles except in the case of David. W. Patten who fela martyr to his religion by a special request which he made of the Lord that he might die that death. But the rest of the quorumof the Twelve have stood in the front of the battle & the danger for the last twenty years in the midst of mobs sickness & plagues & dangers by sea & land but still they were preserved untill the present day in bloom & health He refered to the great prosperity & work of the Twelve abroad among the nations & rejoiced that the Lord had preserved them to returned from the fore cornors of the Earth to again sit in counsel together in Zion. He had the most im-plicit confidence in each member of the quorum of the Twelve Apostles also of the Presidency who presided over us said President Young was a Father to the whole churchErastus Snow next spoke & said though he was one of the youngest of the quorum of the Twelve yet he had known the quorum from the begining when they were first together in his fathers house He expressed his Joy in being with the quorum & his Entire confidence in each member of the quorum & in the Saints generally. Since his absence to Denmark he had felt & learned how to appreciate the society at home & the brethren & anticipated much pleasure in the association of this present winterhoped our meetings might be freequent & that we might become much improved.President O Hyde remarked that if we were at liberty to prophesy it is while we are together as we are moved upon by the Holy Ghost and if we dont fell to prophesy speak by faith & by faith it should be fulfilled expressed his unlimited confidence in evry member of the Quorum & of the Presidency and Prophesied in the name of God that we should all meet & come forth in the morning of the first Resurrection & receive our crowns in the celestial kingdom it was confirmed by a good Amen by all the quorumJohn Taylor next spoke said he glad to meet with the quorumHe refered to the changes taking place among the Nation of the Earth & he believed we were destined to soon hold a great influence among them He had felt moved upon at times to offer at times some counsl to sir Robert Peel & Louis Napolian & such men & tell them that he could give them advice that would do them good He believed the day near when the kings near would seek counsel at our hands in the begining the Elders went out & were weak & ignorant men now they are full of intelligence & the Nations of the Earth will feel their influence when I am with this quorum I feel as though I was with the Gods.G A Smith said he was delighted on the present occasion He rejoiced to see the union of the quorum & their disposition to do right we dont have to feel that one of the quorum like Lyman Wight is drawing off one way & John E. Page another & A Wm Smith commit-ing iniquity & we have to sustain him against our feelings. I have 
 the satisfaction of believeing that each member of the quo[ru]m is doing right & I rejoice that the quorum is able to publish the gospel in six different Languages & to gather the people together Hoped we should meet once a week & with the Presid[enc]y offer our prayers. He felt a proud satisfaction of being associ-ated with 10 men which he believed to be the highest learned best Educated & possessed the most intelligence of any man on Earth That our circumstances were such that we were oblieged to have the most knowledge whether we would or not. He believed the prophesies uttered this evening would be fulfilled to the utter most He closed with his blessings upon us.A Lyman said he had so many things upon his mind that he knew not what point to speak from He felt in his nature that he was made up in the work of the Lord & he could not embrace any interest any whare els ownly in this work. He has found out to his satisfa-ction what that love & affection for his brethren is that surpases the love of women for he had a confidence in his quorum that was far greater than in his wives or children for they have been brought up in the hard school of experience & have been tried in all things & proven to be true & I have been proven with them & I am wedded to my quorum with all my interest I go when I am sent & come when I am called, & so expect to continue to do my interest is inseparably conneted with this kingdom & I trust ever will be through time & Eternity.C. C. Rich said those who had spoken ^met^ his feeling. He concured in them all I am happy in the present meeting. I had a dream while on my way home I thought the Ancients in their resurrected bodies were associating with us in this place. I have the most unbounded confi-dence not ownly in the quorum of the Twelve but also in the first Presidency. I hope the winter seasons may be profitable to us in our associations and that we may improve our timeE T Benson said he felt to concur in what had been said I feel it to be a great blessing to come together we have been blessed according to the desire of our hearts before I Joined the Saints I felt as though I would give all I possessed if I could find a people who wold do right & be led by the spirit & power of God & I could be associated with them I now feel that I have found that people. I now feel associ-ated with men with whom I could trust my Eternal interes I could leave my family with them any length of time & find them all right on my return. I have the utmost confid[en]ce in evry member of that quorum. there is nothing to be done but what we can do. Evry gift & qualifycation exhists in this quorum that there is in the church Els we cannot be equal with the first Presidency & they must have all we have got or they could not preside over us. If the first Presidency were to be removed the quorum of the Twelve would have to preside& if they had not the fulness of the gifts they wold not be fit to preside. I feel excedingly thankful to be associated with such men I have not language to express my feelings when I was first called to be an Apostle in this quorum I could not sleep for three days & nights I feel now as though I could break a Nation to pieces I felt renovated with the Holy Spirit while P P Pratt was speaking No blessing is to great or to good for us & we shall possess them all.[FIGURE] Turn over 3 leaves 
 A Speech of P. P. Pratt in the Council Chamber of the Legislative AssemblyCouncil Chamber Wednesday Dec 18th 1852 10 oclok A.M.Councilor P. P. Pratt occupied the Chair in the abscence of the presidentbut resigned it to address the council. The Honorable Counselor saidGentlemen. I resign my place to the Hon CounsellrCouncilor on my left& beg the privilege to express my views on government at some lengthNo merely human Government ever had the power to originateor esstablish a system of true religion but on the other hand a truereligious system contains within itself the inherant and inaliena-ble germs of all true Government. True religion has the right& the power to originate government & Laws for individualsFamilies, Corporate Bodies, States, Nations, Empires, or worlds,A true systems of Religions Embraces all the real government that intelligent beings can need or reasonably desire in the Heavens or on the Earth Mearly human government nevercreated a Prophet an Apostle an Eternal High Priest a Godor a Son of God. On the other hand the Eternal Priesthood hascreated worlds & peopled them with man & with all the varietyof universal vegitable & animal resources. The Eternal priesthod has Eternal Priesthood Elected ordained & anointed Kings& priests upon Our Earth & filled them with the spirit of wisdom knowledge power might majesty & dominion for thebenefit, instruction, government, & exhaltation of the race orof the nations or nations thus favored. All governments notgrowing out of the true system & authority of religion is aperversion a mockery a dark unwieldy mass without certainty, stability or guarantee for evin peace safety or perpetoity all such government is either founded inignorance or self will wharein the people declair either in wordor in act that God and Inspiration shall not controll them & that an Angel Prophet Apostle Priest or King Commishinedby him shall have no rule or have no sway in their NationalCouncils. All such governments are either in open violatin Rebellion against the powers that be or act wholey ignorantof the powers that have a right to be. I will illustrate this subj.by refferane to the past. When man was first placed upon the Earth did he create governments or was governments given ^appointed^ to him by the Election of God made manifest by Revelationdid the lower Creation rise up & Elect Adam or dig God sayHave thou dominion from whence then was the first introduct-ion of merely human government upon our Earth. Theanswer to this you will find in the words of God which He spakeunto Moses on the mount as revealed in those days by our greatProphet & myrter. informing us that Adam begat Sons & daughters who went out & peopled the land in pairs long beforethe birth of Cain & Ableel. And when Adam taught them the wordof the Lord & the principles of righteousness & true governmentSatan came also among them & said unto them believe it notand they believed not in the teaching of Adam but they believedSatan more than God or more than the ruler He had appointedThare then arose the foundation of self Government withot GodA government which was perpetual for many centuriesand which finally filled the Earth with violence & corruption& was overthrown by the flood of those who survived the flood Noahwas of course 
 the lawful king Patriarch or ruler and after him the Electionof God continued through the loins of Shem down to Abrahambut in Abrahams day according to his own writings latelytaken from the tombs of ancient Thebees & translated andpublished by our great Prophet we find a man made govermentexisting in Egypt under a race of Phariohs. This Egypt accordingto Phario Abrahams account was first discovered by Egyptus orDaughter of Ham who afterwards settled her sons in it & from wholwhom sprang the race of Pharaioh's & the Ancient Egyptians the sameauthority also informs us that Ham & his race were cursed as itregards priesthood but blessed in matters pertaining to the fruits of the Earth & of wisdom. And that the Pharioh's & theirpriests had not the priesthood although they pretended to havereceived it from Ham their progenitor. Hence we find a Government in Egypt of mere human origen and a pri-esthood and Religion by law Esstablished which worshipedseveral Gods among which was the crockadile & which sacrafizedHuman sacrafices upon the Alter of State Hence the calling out ofAbraham & the reesstablishing of a government of God to be per-petuated in his linage for Ever. which linage is Elected to reign& rule & hold the keys of religion Priesthood Power & Governmentwhile the Earth endures & in worlds without End. This govern-ment was perpetuated in the family of Isaac & Jacob & was exemplified in the person of Joseph who by the gift of Revelation became prime minister of Egypt & saved his Fathers house & the Nations from Death by famine. Here is an instance of a mere Human government yielding to be instructed & benefited by a Revelation & a prophet Behold the result Descending the stream of time & traceing the fortunes of the chosen or Royal linage we next find a Moses a man in whom was the spirit of true Religion. By this religion He overthrew the Egyptians delivered the nation from bondage led them forth to freedom & gave them laws. By this Religion his successor Joshua was also Elected & qualified through him by the laying on of hands and by this religion were all the Judges chosen & qualifyed to fill the Judiciary with equity & Justi[c]eNow Mr President it is Clear that none of these glorious events were the result of popular Elections or of human institutions.God gave a system of Religion Embracing Inspiration visions Prophets & Priesthood & that Religion & those prophets & Revelations Created Nations Governments & Laws. Hence true government in all its Branches and Ramification is the legitimate result or production of true Religion. For instant the Prophet Samuel by virtue of his Religious gift had power to Elect by the word of God & to Anoint Saul to be king of Israel and by the same religious authority he had the right to reprove & even to reject that same king & to anoint & place upon the head Throne a shepherd boy called david in his stead And when Samuel was dead & David was king of Israel Nathan another Prophet had power to reprove him for iniquity & to pass Judgment upon him for his sins. Again when Elijah had rebuked King Ahah & all his wicked rulers & adulterous priests & had fled to the mountains because they rebelled & saught his life He was commanded to return and Anoint Jehu for King of Israel. Haziel for King o[f] Syria & Elisha for Prophet in his Stead which he performed & was taken up. 
 In all these things I see not a vestage of the trumpary of modern human institutions Either of democracy whigery monarchy or Arisstocricy I see nothing in fact but religion standing forth in its own native simplicity & clad in the panoply of its own legiteimate heavenly powers giving government & Laws to Nations and appointing and Anointing majestrates kings & Judges to administer the same. But leaving for a moment the events of palestine I glance for a moment at Babylon whare sat Nebuchadnezzar in all the pride of self confidence & self government. This Monarch had denyied the hand of God & imputed to himself the power & glory of Babylon and the magnitude & glory of his vast dominion He had also Esstablished a Religion & created it by law at a given signal all person ^on pain of death^ were to bow down to his images & idols. But Daniel & his fellows were their with the true Religion Dreams, interpetations, visions, prophesyings, and Miracles & the word of God Rebuking & punishing him soon converted him to the truth He then published an Epistle to all Nations & Tongues under his dominions & in all languages the perpose of which was that God was a revealer of secrets a worker of signs & wonders & an originator & controler of political power & government. [##Daniel 1-4##] In Babylon it was soon conseded that the wisdom of one Revelator or Prophet was ten times more valuable than all the combined wisdom of its sages without this gift. Hence Daniel was wisely placed in power as president of the Presidents of more than a hundred provinces. [##Daniel 6:1-3##] This same Daniel by the word of the Lord afterwords reproved & Dethroned Belshazer and placed Cyrus the Mede upon the Throne of Babylon. [##Daniel 5:29-31##] This Monarch obeyed the word of the Lord so far as to restore the Jews & rebuild their City & Temple. [##Ezra 1##] So long as the Jews obeyed the voice of their Prophets they prospered & were free but loosing the spirit of prophesy & true religion they forfeited their institutions laws & doctrin. Hence Johnthe Baptist & Jesus Christ found them in bondage to a Government Called Rome.These Romans like the Greeks before them had manufactured their own Government & Religion & then enforced it upon others insom-uch that the Jews themselves having lost the power of their own religion were oblieged to submit. John the Baptist & Jesus Christ reproved all the needless trash & powerless forms of Jewish sects & of Gentiles supers-titions & restored to the world the gifts of prophesy visions Revelation ^&^ Miracles. which would have broaken the human yoke reesstablished the independance of Israel & made Jerrusalem the perpetual seat of Government for all nations. But they would not. Jesus Christ would have made their Temple a house of prayer for all Nations in all coming time He would have placed there the Eternal keys of priesthood power & Government & wisdom. ^* A page missed turn to the star^The Blackness of Darkness veiled the Earth in morning Ages—Centuries—now fled— Politics— Laws— Religions have multiplied- Empires— Kingdoms— States— Repub[l]ics have filled the world. But whare— O whare!— The keys powers 
 Religion knowledge or Government of God— Our puriton Fathers fled to the American wilderness to rid themselves from the corruption of ages. Their children made a Government wise & Free. But—Alas— The Priesthood—The Power—The Religion of Heaven had long since been lost to man— Prophets & Apostles were no more — Our Fathers knew this — And tharefore as wise honest & consistent men they refrained from manufacturing a State Religion.Again were the heavens opened. The Silence of Ages was broake[n] The gloom of overhanging night was pierced with a ray from the worlds of Endless day. A Celestial spark from the heavenly Altar was rekindled upon the Earth. The mystic veil was rent in twain. And the fogs & mysts of long Ages began to roll away as the gloom of a long night before the rising dawn. In the midst of the ownly great & free nation upon the Earth the God of Abraham raised up a mighty Prophet gave him the ancient keys of Religion, Government & power & Restored the Apostleship with its keys of Revelation vision & Prophecy. Through the administration of which the laws & government were restored to man & his Kingdom organized upon the Earth no more to be thronewn down. People, Magestrates, Senators, Govornors, & States have opposed its progress with fire & sword & death but all in vain. It has waded through calumny hate & oppression & blood & fire & martyrdom Till it organized itself amid the strong holds of these Eternal Mountains & Stood forth a Noble spectacle for the wonder & admiration of all Nations A Government created by Heaven preserved by the matchless power of the Almighty & led and id instructed by Prophets & Apostles with the keys of Revelation. The United States were constrained to recognize & sustain that which no human power could subdue. Hence the Territorial Govern-ment of Utah. And Hence the local capacity in which we are now siting as Senators & Representitives to give Laws to a Territory. In our Local, political capacity Executive, Legislative & Judicial we are limited to the geogra-phical boundaries prescribed by the act of Congress in this sens our Jurisdiction is bounded by Oregon On the North by Calafornia on the West by 37 of North Lat on the South and by the snow clad sumits of the Backbone of our continent On the East & thus confined in its immediate bearing to a country not much larger than the British IslesBut the Eyes of the Nations are upon us, we are a city on a hill a candle on a candlestick that cannot be hid The great the noble of heart, the Enterprising, the oppressed of all Nations will flow to us as a continues stream Senators Govornors Kings & Rulers will cast their Eyes to Utah & to her Prophets, Apostles, Revelations laws & institutions as a model a pattern in miniature for the renovation of the world. In our capacity as Prophets Apostles & Elders we have the keys of Authority to Organize & give laws form & constitution to a thousand local governments like this. Yes Mr President it is ourseto teach Judges How to rule, To give Senators wisdom & to repprove instruct & impart wisdom to Presidents and Kings 
 It is ours to impart wisdom & knowledge & strength & salvation to the Rulers & people of the great Nation whichgave us birth. Untill they know this & seek it at ourhands they will never arise to any considerable degreeof permanent prosperity & peace. But On the contraryvexation Disunion perplexity division is their doom and bloody wars & pestilence & storms & fires & whirlwinds& tempest Earthquakes & famines will continue to wastethem till they shall be constrained to acknowledge thehand of God & to humble themselves as in the dust &seek wisdom & instruction at the hand of prophets &Apostles as did Kings & rulers in days of Old. Untilllike Nebuchadnezzar they shall acknowledge that Godis a Revelator a worker of signs & wonders and anoriginator & controllor of political Governments.Yes Mr President Our Nation & the world shall beb taught by the prophets & all Nations feel the influence of the Institutions now being developted in thes Halls of libertythe chambers of the Eternal Mountains of DeserettLet the United States go on in their course own strengthwithout the inspiration & institutions of the Almighty nowoffered them by our Prophets let them spread abroadtheir dominions on evry side.

P. Prat thinks it should include the present quorum merely E Snow would like to see included all that could be found of D W. Patten. C. C. Rich said he heard Brother Patten say the morning that he was martered that the Kingdom of God shall be delive[re]d or he should lay down his life.

 WILFORD WOODRUFF'S JOURNAL FOR 1853 
 January 1, 1853 ~ SaturdayJAN 1st 1853 The commencement of a new year in the midst of a New Era. O how time flies and how great, how important how magnificent, and how mighty are the Events born on its wings it is the opening of a dispensation that swallows up all other dispensations since the world began the deeds of the last thousand years sink into insigniff-icans in comparrison to the work of a year at the present time The Heavens gaze upon the scenes as they pass with deep interes while the whole Earth beholds the scenes in wonder & amacementThe ancients Prophets saw by vision & revelation the scenes which were to follow each other in quick succession in this age in the esstablishment of the great Kingdom of our God to be thrown down no more forever. The little stone cut out of the mountain without hands that was to roll forth untill it became a mountain & filled the whole Earth & broke in peaces & subdued all other kingdoms & was to stand forever as seen by the prophet Daniel has commenced its work. that Church & Kingdom of God is now on the Earth & is being esstablished which must endure & the world are gaziong upon it, it is now located in these vallies of the mountains like a city set upon a hill which cannot be hid. its first Prophet & Founder has laid down his life in its defence He has been martered, & his blood is crying from the ground for vangance upon a great Nation. many others have fallen a martyr to the truth & the gospel of Jesus Christ since the organiza-tion of this church in A.D. 1830 & many others may, yet the Church is bound to arise & prosper untill the Zion & Kingdom of our God shall stand forth in bold relief containing all that power, strength, might, majesty & dominion which God has decreed concerning her & been spoken through the mouths of his Holy Prophets since the world began. This Church & Kingdom has continued steadily to arise since its first organization amid oppostion, oppression, persecution, & martyrdom untill it has become esstablished in the midst of thes everlasting hills & mountains not ownly gaining strength in church but also in state. Ephraims Nobles are of himself & his Govonor has procedid out of the midst of him. And while truth inspires my heart shall I fear to write it MShall I fear that the present or future Generations shall read those truths which are burning in my breast enkindled by the Holy Alters of Heaven No God forbid for the voice of truth whispers to me that Our Govornors Presidents & senators now arising out of the Kingdom of God will be inspired to take bold measures, to perform daring acts, rise up in their stregngth & power & stregth [stretch] forth their strong arms & save from annihilation that Holy instrument the Constitutin of the United States. which the American People are about to sell for a mess of potage & triying to consine it to the grave. Their is a power who has decreed that liberty freedom & the rights of the Righteous & the meeke of the Earth shall not wholey die & that power is God. And He has decreed to inspire & nerve up the Soul the sinew & the Arm of his Govornors Senators & prophets & Arm them for the contest, and defend them in their warfare That Nation or Kingdom or Toungue or people, from this time forth who shall rise up against Zion & the Church & Kingdom of God to oppress her. They shall be visited by the Judgments of the Most High they shall be overthrown & brought to desolation & may God spedily Hasten it May the Almighty begin this year to rend the kingdoms of this world with his Servants & continue it untill all nations shall acknowled[ge] ther is a God in Israel 
 Jan 1st 1853 The quorum of the Twelve Apostles met at the Council House at 8 oclok being eleven in number the whole quorum except Elder Orson Pratt (who is at Washington preaching the gospel) The quorum marched to President Brigham Youngs & wished him a Happy New Year President Young received them with Joy & gladness & after the greetings were over President Young asked what he should treat them with. The senti-ment was instanteneous in the hearts of all the quorum & spoken by president Orson Hyde, treat us with your blessings then President Young blessed the quorum of the Twelve & said they always had his blessings. And the Twelve Apostles felt & realized that the blessings of the Presidency of the Church& Kingdom of God was of far more worth & benefit to them than any Earthly gift or the Treasures of the Earth their hearts were full of joy & gladness which was unspeakable at the blessing of once more having the privilege of returning from the four corners of the Earth & beholding each others faces & sitting in council together & meeting with the president & his counsel & receiving blessings at their hands. The Twelve left their blessgs upon President Young & his house while the Twelve were paying their respts to President Young the band was playing a lively tune in front of the House the quorum saluted the two bands with a Happy New Year & received in return some excellent music. The quorum then visited President HeberC Kimball & wished him a happy new Year. He also received the Twelve with Gladness & gave unto them his blessings which was alsohighly prized. In his blessings unto them he said his faith & feelings were that no one of the present quorum of Apostles should ever fall & no power should ever take their Crown & Kingdom but they should come forthin the morning of the first Resurrection & be exhalted to glory immortal-ity & Eternal lives, and their blessings should increase from this time henceforth & for ever & they should not want bread but they should have means to support themselves & families. My Feelings have ever been good towards this quorum & ever will be. The Twelve left theirblessings upon presidet Kimball & household. And next visited Father John Smith the aged Patriarch & wished him a happy New Year. He manifested much Joy & satisfaction in seeing Eleven of the Twelve Apostles beneath his roof. This venerable Patriarch also bestowed upon the Twelve his blessing, & said they should live to see the Kingdom of God ^& Zion^ esstablished to be thrown down no more forever & that none of them should ever fall but should have part in the first resurrection, no power shouldtake their crown but they should be blessed in all their labours in the Earth & that the blessings of God should increase upon them from this time forth both temporal & spiritual. The Apostles also left theirblessings upon the Patriarch & his household they next visited President Willard Richards He also received them with Gladness & an open hartthey wished him a Happy new year. He also gave the Twelve hisblessing He believed this is a begining of an Eventful year in the History of this Church & kingdom on the Earth & he believed each suceeding  year would be more & more so untill the coming of the son of manHe said the Twelve were ever before him in his thoughts prayers & blessings notwithstanding they might be scattered to the fore cornors of the Earththey were men of God & were destined to perform a great & mighty work in the Earth & they should live till they were satisfyed with life they shouldsee light & truth prevail over sin tradition & Error & triumph in the Earth.The Twelve next went to the house of Elder P. P Pratt & there united with his family in singing the return of the Twelve & other songs of Zion. The spirit & power of God rested upon the quorum of the Twelve while their hearts were filled with praise & thanksgiving to God in all their visits on this the new year of 1853. The bands also continued their salutations to Presidents Kimball Richards & Patriarch Smith & many others in various parts of the City & their enliveningmusic was evry whare received with open ears & harts of Joy God bless the bands

Martin Luther with others created a great change in his day from Popary, to more freedom of conscience in religious & political matters & the way has been prepared in process of time so the kingdom of God has been esstablished & so with all the events of the present day steem power, rail roads Telegraph lines, & all the Revolutions of the present Nations may we not acknowledge thehand of God in them all as bringing to pass the purposes of the Lord. The Lord says he is angry with none exsept those who do not acknowledge his hand in all things No man can find out Godwe shall not noknow as much as God for then there would wouldbe two competitors on the Throne we may see the day when we shall know as much as God does now but then He will know as much more at that time than we as he does now. if we do wrong we shall be chastized for it if we do well we shall have our reward for that 
 P. P. Pratt followed & said how could doors be open in China & other parts of the world if God had not moved upon some of the Nations to cause a change among the nations & to have thebible printed in the different languages so the people could have the scriptures to read. After men have published the bible & got $50,000 dollars for the same if they wont receive the fulness of the gospel when they hear it the Lord can say to them you are well paid for what you have done & if you wont do any more go your way I will raise up somebody else so dont you complain as you have got your pay I fell thankful for a few truths that are abr[oa]din the world as it prepares the way for many moreBrother A Lyman followed & said he was glad to hear what had been said He felt to acknowledge the hand of God in all things many might say we would have bettered our condition if we had gone to Calafornia but if you had gone there you would have gone whare the devil would have had a chance to have spewed his filth over you fo it would have been like going into the midst of hell some complan about these Hills, deserts & mountains it is in consequence of these things that we are here if we were in a desireable spot whare the gentiles would wish to occupy it we would have trouble from them & these are some of the things we ought to be thakful for those persons that would be discontented with this people would be discontented in paradise & they might have the making of it themselves it would add much to the happiness of mankind if they would be submissive to those powers which they cannot controll but which ought to controll themI met in councel with the Presidency & Twelve in the Afternoon for prayer.

 January 30, 1853 ~ SundayJan 30th Sunday P. P. Pratt preached. his subject was the Kingdom of God which was to be set up in the last days He said if we were to take the present order rules & regulations of either the Jews, Gentiles Christian or pagan as as Standrdstandard to set up as the patern for the great Kingdom of our God of which the prophets had spoken their was none of the which would fit compare or answer the purpose at all for the last dispensation when did we ever see a generation or any Nation make their own prophets & Apostles to get Revelation & do the wok of God. In order to set up a kingdom & gov[ernme]nt in the last days to gather the 10 Tribes of Israel the Jews & gentiles & all Nations break down the Romon power build up esstablish Zion & maintain it. it must be sumthing diff[ere]nt from any Human government or device of man it must originate from the heavens be governed & controlled by the God of heaven led by inspiration & Revelation in all of its undertakings & it must contain within itself all the blessings & covenants which God made to Abraham concerning his seed & posterity. This Kingdom is here in the valley of the mountains it has been esstablished by the hand of God and it embraces all that God has promised, or that is necessary toperfect the great work or all that Jew or Gentile can look forit embraces the whole of the New & everlasting covenant the fulness of the gospel, with all the power & Authority of the same the Keys of the Kingdom the endowments sealing powers the patriarchal Matrimony & the foundation laid for gathering all Israel.The Ancient deciples & Apostles did not set up this Kingdom as some have supposed when they inquired of Jesus if he would at that time restore again the Kingdom to Israel Jesus informed them that it was not given to them to know (even) the times & seasons which the Lord had reserved unto himself when he would set up the Kingdom so they were not permitted to know the time much less to perform the work They asked the Saviour what they should do then He told them they should bear witness of his name before both Jew & gentile & for this same testimony they would have to lay down their livesthe Kingdom of God was set up in their day but the people would not permit it to remain long among [them] for they killed the prophets, Apostles, & Elders who preached the gospel of the kingdom of the Kingdom of God & the priesthood & Kingdom of God was taken from them & they have fallen into darkness & Error. But now the Kingdom of God is set up for the last time to again restore Israel & you cannot force Israel even by the sword to receive a Kingdom & Laws & acknowledge the great standard which is to be set up in the last days for the governing gathering & controlling of all Israel except it is right & according to the promises made to the Fathers & this Kingdom of God when it was to appear was to be like a mustard seed it was to be the least of all herbs but was to grow untill the folls fowls of heaven lodged in the branches thereoff. should we attempt to take any of the Kingdoms of the world as this great standard out of which to build the Kingdom of God it would not compare at all with the parable given. but when we take 
 the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints it does compare in every respect & contains within itself evry thing that is promis in the great standard that was to be set up in the last days it is no matter what this is called at the present time a church a republic or a Kingdom. the Kingdom is certainly here & in vary deed it has commenced like a mustard seed vary small but as the seed gathers its seed mosture from the Earth which causes it to spring forth & take root so will this Kingdom continue to gather the good from all Nations untill it becomes the greatest of All Kingdoms under Heaven & untill the Kingdoms of this world become the Kingdom of our God & his Christ the signs of this Kingdom are appearing in the heavens & the Earth that was spoken off by Christ & the Apotles & why should not the Kingdom appear some may say I have been Baptized Joined the church am in the Kingdom Now why may not I go to Calafornia & get gold & take all the comfort I can in this world well if one part of the Kingdom of God have a right to go the whole have & scatter abroad then whare is your Kingdom & gathering we are now in as good a place as we can get inif we were to go to calafornia we would be whare we would be in the midst of the scum of Hell. If we should go to Cal or New Orlens because we could get sugar for 3 cts whare would the work of the Kingdom of God be my views are that when we are gathered we keep so & build up Temples give Endowments to the living & dead except as we go on missions abroad in the world as the Angels would go to hell on a mission & [be] glad to return as soon as they got through. If you want gold build up the Kingdom of God make Zion a city on a hill that cannot be hid & carry out the purposes of the Lord & then gold will flow in unto you from all Nations your Presidency & Apostles will then hardly have time to go out of the Temple to get their breakfast instead of runing about to know how to get their land ploughed so as to raise bread to eat & while all Nations are breaking up[.] the rich am[on]g them will invest their wealth among the institution of Zion & not trust it among the sinking Nations & those that wished to save their lives will flee to Zion for safety for they will be the ownly people that will not be at war one with another many other Edifying remrks were mad by the speakrElder Amasa Lyman followed & said that the members of this Kingdom possessed that faith & knowledge that if all the world would say they did not believe it it would not make any difference with them for they know of its truths The sectarian world can write & say many putty things but why do they not carry them into practice the main difficulty is their is no nucleus around which to gather, in order to practice what they preach. but we believe that when God said he would set up a kingdom which should break in peaces all other Kingdoms & stand forever that He will perform what He has spoken. The Lord has said that that Nation that fought against Zion should be broaken in peaces & utterly wasted away & while the Elders are gathering the Saints from all Nations & Kingdoms & will continue untill the winding up scene we can make some calculation what Zion is destined to be. many other remarks were made by Brother Lyman 
 I attended prayer meeting with the Presidency & Twelve in the Af-ternoon & I preached in the evening to a full House in the 14th ward school House I also spoke upon the kingdom of Godsaid that none of the words of the Lord spoken would retu-rn unto him void but would accomplish all that he had declaired that the Elders were gaining more strength & confidence & power, in declairing the Kingdom of God to the world. I confirmed one member of the ChuchJanuary 31, 1853 ~ Monday31st & 32 I spent the time at home writingFebruary 1, 1853 ~ TuesdayFeb 1st I spent the day writing we had a hard snow storm at nightFebruary 2, 1853 ~ Wednesday2nd [FIGURE] I wrote a Letter to Benjamin BakerFebruary 3, 1853 ~ Thursday to February 5, 1853 ~ Saturday3, 4 5. I spent the time writing my byographyFebruary 6, 1853 ~ Sunday6th Sunday I attended meeting Elder Lorenzo Snow preachedHe spoke vary well exhorted the saints to faithfulness the young men to study the different languages that they might be useful among the Nations He exhorted the saints that was expetg [expecting] to stay in the valley to do all they could to forward the work of God He said if any of the brethren wanted to be marterd or lay down their lives for Christ sake they can have a chance by going to Europe or some of those foreign Nations He said that after the Danish Government had banished the Amarican Elders from the Kingdom that the native brethren said to the poliece the seed is sown the truth is here it is in our hearts & we are here ourselves & shall defend the truth many interesting remarks were maid by Brother SnowPresident B Young followed & said the organization of man is one of the deepest subjects that the phylosopher of the day attempt to investig[at]e the mystery of man in his organization has been a study for ages it has been a mystery but it is because of ignorance their is no such thing as mystery or miracle ownly to the ignorant any intelligent being that knows the caus & effect of things it is no myracle or mystery it is our privilege to asspire after that knowledge that the greatest inteligance possesses we should take that course that we may ever increase in knowledge than we are sure of exhaltationwhy I make mention of this thing is because I look upon this people who are now before me I am like the rest of you that when the light of truth shines upon me my mind enlightened and I am asstonished to look at the world of mankind their actions are like little Childrenyou look at your children about the House & you will see pe[r]fectpattern of the world the children will fight & cry about & after evry thing that they ought not to have they want a looking glass hammer razor & many things that they would injure themselves & are not old enough to handle so it is with allthe world if they had all their desires granted them they would leap deaches, fences, hedges & gutters & go to hell across lots & never wait to take the road even old men like children will ask for things they cannot use and I can see the same 
 in this Church many of the people ask for things they cannothandle I see it evry day. I wish to exhort the people here to anitem of our religion yet I am happy to say that the item that I am about to exhort you to the people generally are ready to carryout firstly I would say let us observe the mormon creed letevry mind their own business evry one has weeds enough in his own guarding to attend to without attending to the weeds in his Neighbors garden for while you are attending tothe weeds of your Neighbor those in your own will grow varythick & tall & will finally spoil the good seed I am asstonished that the people do not see that they can get along much betterwithout doing evil than with. if a person does you an injury dontretaliate & you get a great advantage of the person doing the evilif a person injures you do him good & you get the advantageof him & the victory. Follow the counsel of Brother Snow and improve your time in study & treasureing up knowledge childnshould have their times of recreations for if they are kept stillfrom seeing & knowing any thing appertaining to amusements tillthey are 18 yars of age when they do get out they will act vary wild. but let the children sow their wild oats do up thedancing & frolicking while young that when they get older they m[a]yread the Bible Book of Mormon & preach the gospel & do goog [good] onthe Earth I want to know all their is on Earth in Heaven& Hell so that no person shall know more than I do but in obtaining this knowledge I do not wish to sin their is no need of singing.If the weather had been good I should have called uponthe people to have commenced diging out the foundation of the TempleI want to lay the cornor stone of the Temple on the 6th day of next April if the Lord will if you want to know what size I amcalculating to build the Temple I will say I am expecting tobreak ground 150 feet by 220 And the foundation forthe building to stand upon 20 feet deep & 20 feet wide& 10 feet high the basement story will then commence on the top of the foundation & that will be 16 feet high 8 feet underground & 8 feet above then the main building will commenceon the top of the basement story. what is there here in thisvalley that should hendor this people from being happy I am happy because I do not fret about any thing that I cannot do. I wont fret about any thing what henders yourpraying & praising God No body but your own selves if youare seeking to weed your neighbors garden you will havebusiness enough. but this is a happy people I wish they would prize their blessings. You have not got to mourn as did the Ancients because their children would Apostitiseturn from God & be cursed Our children will not Apostitzethey will not have time but will have all they can do to performthe work of God as it rolls upon them to prepare the kingdom for the coming of Christ gather up the Nations &c Then be happy & do the things required of youI attended the prayer meeting in the Afternoon And preachedto the 14 ward school House in the evening to a crouded HouseI took for my text the mormon creed mind your own business I told them what our own business was to preach 
 the gospel to the Nations of the Earth gather Israel & build up Zionweed our own gardens & let our neighbors alone. dont interferewith your neighbors affairs for that is his business & not oursFebruary 7, 1853 ~ Monday7th I walked to Snows herd ground & back distance of the day 20.February 8, 1853 ~ Tuesday to February 9, 1853 ~ Wednesday8, 9. I spent the day at home writingFebruary 10, 1853 ~ Thursday10th I spent this day at home writingFebruary 11, 1853 ~ FridayFeb 11th [FIGURES] This was a painful day I was called at about 1 oclokthis morning to administer to sister Rhodes who had been labouring in Child birth for two days she was nearly worn out as she could not be deliverd. Brother Franklin Richards with myselfadministerd to her but she died at 2 oclock amid the greatest Agiony I closedher eyes. At 3 oclock PM. there was a Post Mortom examination madethe Presidency and several of the Twelve were present the surgical operationwas performed by Dr Andrews and no blame was attached to the mid wives who officiated {the following is the result of the examination the child lay across the womb with own hand oblong the head lay on the right side the feet on the left the child had torn the womb to pieces with his feet and the afterbirth so if the child had been born the woman could not live the doctor gave the following instructing to the women if the child presents feet first put a hand into the womb and bring out the child feet first and if the child's face is turned so the chin would hook under the [illegible] bone turn the child with the face towards the back bone then it can be born if the child's feet come doubled up put up the hand and bring down one limb at a time in the womb and turn the child he said the woman's [feelings] should not be consulted at such times but the midwife should use their own [illegible]}February 12, 1853 ~ Saturday12th [FIGURE] I attended sister Rhodes Funeral The President Twelve & a large congregation of people assembled and President Young preached & said that the few remarks I have to make I will endeavorto speak to the point my text is it is better to go to the house of mour-ning than to the House of feasting for that is the end of all men & the livingwill lay it to heart. When we are in a situation so that we cannot know any thing ownly what we know by the natural senses it causesus to mourn the loss of friends but if we could understand all things it would often times be a source of Joy instead of morningwhen a spirit enters a tabernacle here in this life it enters into a state of sorrow yet if we understood things in their tru light we should be satisfyed with it. When the spiritenters the body it enters a dark sell and is left to sorrow &to be tried in all things but when the spirit leaves the body if a saint it enters into the brilliant light and glory of God liketaking a prisioner out of a dark sell whare he could see alittle glimmer of light through the grates & put him into theblaze of the mid days sun. when we loose our Friends we mournbut what is it that mourns is it that light, truth and intellige[nce]of the Almighty that is in man that mourns No it is the grocerpart of our being that mourns let a person be unclothed andwe could see the spirit of our sister and all other friends & shakehands with them & spirit be tangible to each other as our bodiesnow are to each other when I am filled with the spirit of God I can see men and what is in them and the more we are inrefined in spirit the more we can see the reason I cannot shake hands with Sister Rhodes is becaus of this gross body. Womenwere not made to die in child bed as Sister Rhodes has donebut what is the matter death is here it is death that has causedit death is in the land around us it is here Children die before theyare born this because their is death around us we cannot 
 se it we have the Head ake we cannot se that (yet it exist) because we arein the body but if we were out of the body we could se it we should advancein the phylosophy of Eternal things and learn as we live whenwe go to the House of feasting we go to feast our bodies when we go to thehouse of mourning we mourn as it were in spirit and our minds are called to serious truths but what would really be a case ofmourning it would be to follow a person to the grave who had notimproved their day of salvation had an oppertunity of being saved& exhalted & had neglected it that would be a case of mourning buta person that had done the best they could & improved their oppor-tunities of salvation we have no cause to mourn for such I would say to the children dont mourn for your mother I would to God you wasas sure of salvation as your mother is If I was to mourn for any thingin this case it would be because we have not more power to cast the devil out of the house and out of the Neighborhood. Can werealize that sister Rhodes is not dead she lives now morethan she did before it is the sinner that will die not the Righteouswhen the spirit of this woman left the body it was ushered intoa flood of light but her body is as any other clay but her spiritis in open day she saw a little light in the body so as not to put her eyeout when she came to the full lightI wish to give a little counsel to the children here Brother Snow willtake charge of the place I want the children to go to school and want an inventory of things here taken for the benefit of Brother Rhodes & brother Snow both I request the children to doas well as your mother has done according to the light you have &I will warrant you salvation & Eternal life & I would say the same to all who are here but upon no other principlecan I warrant anybody salvation exsept upon the principleof doing good & obeying the Lord do good to your families & toeach other. I want to say to all present there is no blame to beattached to any of the sisters who waited upon Sister Rhodes theyhave all done as well as they could for I have enquired into the whole affair & her time had come to die & so will [yours]in its turn.February 13, 1853 ~ Sunday13th Sunday Meeting was addressed in the morning B[y] Brother Joseph Young He spoke of the blessings of the people it was not wealth & riches that made men happy but it was by having the truth & obey-ing if this people are called a happy people well they are in a greatmeasure yet many of the saints have disappointment in their pathyet we should trust all our affairs in the hands of god we shoulddo right & follow the counsel of those that are set over us & carryout their views & the blessing of God will attend us & we shall be happyJ. M. Grant followed and said he hoped all wouldattend to their prayers it takes as much to damn a man as itdoes to save him some wonder why we dont have revelationnow in our day as well as in the days of Joseph. in his day the bretnwould not build a log cabin till they went to Joseph to ask counselhow they should set it whare they should put the door &c but at the present day men have learned to do sumthing themselves withouttroubling the president or the Lord about it some have thought if theycould get to Jackson Co Mo or in this valley they would be Holy & amdng [and among]a Holy people but I do not know of any soil that will make men 
 Holy if men are not Holy themselves I dont know of any particular spot of ground that will make them so. Joseph had to give written Revelation to get men to go on missions but I do not believe that any men were ever called more by Revelation or as much as any that were ever called to go on a mission to preach the gospel than were our Brethren last fall nor do I believe any men wer filled more with Revelation & inspiration in blessing those set apart then were our Brethren who blessed those set apart last fall their is no other kingdom like this on the Earth the Ancient Apostles had no more of the spirit of God to prepare them for their work then our Apostles have for the work which they have to perform in our day I would say that the dispensation of Moses & Christ & the Apostles looks like this dis-pensation though this dispensation will eclips all other dispensations for it is the finishing up of the building Moses never began to do what we have to do. I am of the opinion that men that are our prophets Apostles & leaders that have laid the foundation of this Church & kingdom & are building upon it were reserved forom Eternity to come forth in this dispensation to accomplish the great work which is to be done neve[r] did men live with more nerve desission of character perseverance faith & power than those that lead this dispensationHad they have lived in the days of the Apostles they would have raised the devil with both Jew & Gentile. Had they have lived in the days of Moses they would have raised the vary Devil with the Canaanites & various Nations. the commencement of this Church & Kingdom may not appear as great as it did in the days of Moses & Christ & the Apostles but look at the progress of this kingdom. & the deeds & work of Our leaders & the people are startling. even their exidous out of the states to these mountains & the results that have & will follow are greater than the results that followed Moses & the Israelites amighty great Nation have sent their Judges & rulers to us They did not behave themselvs as they should do we cast them out & sent them home if all the world was consolodated into one Nati[on] & sent delegates & rulers unto us if they run against the priest-hood & infringed upon our rights we would cast them out & send them home regardless of consequences we know what the consequences are.I want to say to the mass of the saints here you do not keep up with the Presidency of this Church & those that are associated with him & if you are not careful I fear they will get out of sight of you & perhaps be translated & leve you I pray God to keep you in the path of duty so that you may inherit all the blessings that are promised youPresident Young Kimball followed & said he believed we had more to do than other dispensations yet they had the Keys of the kingdom if they had not had them they could not have given them to us Jesus says my sheep hear my voice & will follow me if they dont pray I think they are not the sheep of Christ if you dont ask the saviosaviour for what you want how do you expect to get it then ask the Lord for what you want Brother Brigham holds the Keys of this Kingdom & no body els holds them as he does others hold keys but they hold them under him He holds the keys that Peter held. some want to go to Calafornia whare it is warmer but going to Calafornia wont warm your hearts the majority of this people have great hearts & you want to be able to stand alone without leaning upon any one if you dont do it you will be aptto fall if I ever get to glory I expect to be tried some think they 
 been tryed by leaving their homes but how is it you was on other mens lands & servants & now you have houses & lands of your ownso this was no great trial but a blessing but you have to be tried. we are going to build up a Temple I expect the devil will kick up a fuss by & by to try you well Let it come I hope the chaff will be blownaway but when Brother Brigham says build this Temple let us go to it rit up. Some have asked if we could do any more good in the States I say yes when those that profess to be saints will gather out & not much beforeB Young followed & said if the people will be on the Temple ground to morrow at 11 oclok we will break the ground for the commencement of the foundation of the Temple. I do not believe that Enoch & his people eincreased in wrighteousnes faith & obedience & improved any faster than this people have since the commencement of this Kingdom I said this in the days of Joseph I have no doubt but God expects us to improve more than any other people that ever lived on the Earth then let us double our dilligence & let the parents both men & women never scease untill they govern themselves in all things and if we are tempted to do wrong never scease untill we conquor that spirit & bring it in subjection under your feet that you may ere long become rulers Kings & Priest unto GodFebruary 14, 1853 ~ Monday[FIGURE] Feb 14th 1853 This was an important and interestingday to the saints in the valley & even in all the world the saints met upon the Temple block in a vast body to break the ground for another Temple the people commenced gathering at an early hour & at 11 oclok there were thousands upon the ground President Young & Counsel The quorum of the Twelve with many of the quorums of the Church were on the ground. All the bands of music in the City were present. at 11 oclok President Brigham Young Heber C Kimball & Willard Richards got into a buggy inside the square surrounded by the quorum of the Twelve President Young arose and addressed the people and said our history is to well known for me to speak of it now. We shall now again attempt to build another Temple we have tried it many times bet have not been able to finished them so as to occupy them for any length of time we may not now but we will triy it we may Just as well build a Temple that will cost a Million of dollars as well as not & we would be just as well off & better to than before And I would just as well build a Temple that would cost a million of Dollars if I knew we should be driven fromit in a month by our enemies as though we should occupy it a Thousand years it is all the same with me for when the Lords Commands us to do any thing we should do it just as freely without asking the whys & wharefore whether we have the privilege of enjoying it or not. If you ask if it is the will of God for us to build a Temple I answer yes it is the will of God we should build a Temple we cannot attend to the ordinances of the House of the Lord without it. If you ask if I have received a revelation or vision upon the subject I would answer yes I have been in vision much of the time upon the subject I knew it was the will of God that we should build a Temple on thise same ground when I first came into the valley and while the brethren were exploring out I said all the time this is the place for the City & Temple 
 it is the will of God that we should do all we can in this valley & surrounding country for the benefit of the people if the people needed it I would give them a written Revelation upon this subject but do you not know that it is your duty to build up Houses for your own benefit you want a buttery bedrooms & other convenient rooms in your dwelling house well we want a Temple more than we want dwelling houses. I will relate some of the sayings of Joseph while in Kirtland He said conserning the building of that Temple that it grieved him & also the spirit of God to think that the saints were not willing to build a Temple by the counsel of the priesthood without a written revelation & commandment from God that was it not for the penurious feelings of the people the Lord would not give revelations & commandments as he does whenever the Lord finds the people willing to do good build up his Kingdom & do good without being commanded He will be more pleased with themI will bring forth my art & plan for a Temple then if any man can present any better plan or get faith enough to call to his aid any of the old Nephites or any of the Anci[en]ts & will present a better plan than mine will be we will receive it.A word to the people I wish to ask if you want a commandment evry year to require you to pay your Tithing when it is a standing law unto Israel & has been from the days of Abraham you all know this well if you dont want to pay your tithing or any portion of you I dont want you should it is for your good not mine I dont want a Temple to get my endowments in For I got my Endowments and all the blessings appertaining thereto under the hands of Joseph before his death & before the Temple was built in Nauvoo & so did so my counsellors and a part of the Tweleve get theirs before the Temple was built. Brother Joseph seemed urged by the spirit of God to perform this workhad he not have done it he might have died without conferring the Keys upon others. if this people pay their tithing we shall have an abundance in the store house to build a Temple with without giving all you have got yet all you have should be upon the Alter ready to be offered if necessary I shall ask the people to come & work out their Tithing by labour for that is what we want I believe we shall have your help.7 years ago tomorrow at 7 oclok I crossed the Missippi River I believed then that God had a good place in the mountains for us & would lead us to it and He has done it for which I feel thankfurl. if some feel quite sorry for not having the privilege of suffering with us but I will promise you all if you will be faithful that you shall have the privilege of suffering & being tried as much as you will wish let all men be satisfied faithful & Humble and God will bless youHeber C Kimball then arose & with uplifted hands to heaven offered up a fervent Heart felt prayer to God imploreing his blessing upon President Young & Councellors & all the Authorites of the Church with the whole house of Israel He then dedicated the ground unto God & prayed for the blessings of the Lord to attend them in building the Temple & all the public works in Zion 
 At the close of the prayer the presidency & Twelve walked tothe South East cornor of the ground laid out for the Templethe ground being frozen President Heber C Kimball commenced breaking the ground with a pick then President Richards thenOrson Hyde Parley Pratt, W Woodruff, J Taylor A. Lyman C. C. Rich E. T. Benson L. Snow E Snow & F. D. Richards thenthe ground was broke & President Young took out the first turfwhile taking it out silver Dollar was flung from some one in the congregation which strut in the hole brother Kimball saidthat was an Omen that we should hav a plenty of mony to build the temple with (Orson pratt was at Washigton &G. A. Smith at Provo all the rest of the Twelve were present)as soon as the turf was taken out the congregation was dismissed& the people rushed to the hole to get a chance to throw a littledirt out. My Father Aphek Woodruff aged 78 years, myselfWilford Woodruff aged 46 years and My Son Wilford Woodruff Jraged 12 years, all flung out dirt out of the foundation for this important Temple. After leaving the Temple ground I went in company with the Presidency & Twele to see the New sugarworks opeprate I saw the Hydraulic press oparate in pres[ing]out the Juice it was a splendid esstablishment Brother JosephRussell of Marimichi had furnished about $50000 dollars to purchase the machinery & apperatus & get it to the valleyto make sugar from the beet. My Children Willford, Phebe& Susan also Emma & Sarah were all present at the breakingof the ground for the foundation of the TempleFebruary 15, 1853 ~ TuesdayFeb 15 A meeting of the seventies was called in the Tabernaclethe House was filled. The meeting was opened by prayer by ZPulsipher. J M Grant Arsose & said this meeting is to transactbusiness, preach & teach the people Regulate the diffent quors&c. The Meeting was then addressed by Z Pulsipher who spokewell & made good remaksHenry Harriman next followed & spoke to edifycationMilo Andrews next followed & also Edifyed the peopleHarrison Burgess next followed He also spoke well quotedsome prophesies said the Seventis were to go out under thedirection of the Twelve & build up the Kingdom of God & regulate all the affairs of the same in all the world whoof the seventies are prepared for all this we should improveall our time in treasuring up Knowledge & instruction& dont spend it foolishly for we shall want all the knowledge we kan obtain in filling our mission to the Nations of theEarth I was baptized in 1832 & have spent more than half of my life in the workAdjourned till 2 oclok Met at 2 ock according to adjournmentPrayer by W. Woodruff who also addressed the congregationthe following are some of the remarks he made. I am alwaysinterested in meeting with the saints esspecialy with so manyof the Seventies & Elder as are here to day. There never was aschool in any age of the world that presents as much of interestto the reflecting mind as the one presenting itself to us in this age notownly the affairs of the church but the History of the Changes & Revelo-tion of all Nations on Earth. the Time has come when the Earth 
 is to be redeemed from the power & dominion of the Devil& the heavens with all the prophets that have ever lived are inludedin the great work the Elders who are before me to day have this great battle to fight & the victor to win I never saw a time in any age of my life when I have had more desire to live than at the present time I want to see the work progress, the kingdom rise that it may become esstablisdin all the Earth & the Effects that will follow. yes the Eldersshould improve their time in treasuring up knowledge &counsel for you will want it when you go the Nations of the Earth dont spent your time in playing cardsdice chess or in any such foolish way but improve thetime to the best advantage & seek to conquer yourselvs& preside over yourselvs & bring all your passions in subjectionto the law of Christ as our president has taught us Oneitem which I count of importance I wish to speak offI wish to exhort the 70s & Elders to keep a Journal & History of their lives for the record & history of thisChurch & Kingdom will be wanted in a future day therhas been no dispensation on Earth the procedings ofwhich will be more interesting than the one in which welive. Should we ever have the privilege in our resurrectedbodies of visiting other planits & the inhabitants of the same weshould want to learn the history of that people if they had kept no records of their lives, & the dealings of God with themso we could get their History we should feel much disap-pointed so would they should they visit us. it is truethat Joseph Smith kept a History of his own life & thosethings in some measure connected with him He is nowdead but his life & Testimony is now being published to theworld in seperate peaces in our publications. Also presidentYoung has scribes who are recording his daily acts & lifewhich is right & good. but does that record the life History & dealings of God with the many thousandsof the Apostles & Elders who are or will be in all the worldamong evry Nation under Heaven No varrily No. thenall ye Elders of Israel write your History & the dealings ofGod with you in all the world for your own benefit& that of your posterity, for the benefit of the Houseof Israel, for the benefit of Jew & Gentile for the benefitof futur generations, & in fine for the benefit of thosecelestial beings from other planets who may see fit tovisit us either in time or Eternity & wish to visit ourlibraries & peruse the History of the inhabitants of theEarth esspecially the saints in the last dispensation & fulnessof times then write & do not neglect it; many otherremarks were made by the speaker which are not recordedHereBrother Wood next made a few remaks said hewould do all the good he could would follow the counsel of the prophets& leave his conscience in the states for he believed the people wouldbe led by the Holy Ghost if they followed the counsel of the prophets whowere set to lead them. He thought they were safer than his conscenefor paul once thought in all good conscience that he was doing Gods will by persecuting the saints so his conscience decvd him 
 A. P. Rockwood next spoke & said my text is in the words of the Apostle Wilford that we are the people chosen to build up the Kingdom this I believe to be true many glorious principles have been displayed in the words of Brother Woodruff & they are worthy to be written & handed down to all generations as it would be profitable for all to read all should write & learn to write in short hand that we may report speeches & sermons let us pay up our tithing & obey the authorities that are put over us the brethren had much rather be brought before the Authorities of the land than the ChurchMeeting adjourned till 6 oclok in the evening when the people met & about 40 were ordained to the Seventies & remarks made from several of the brethrenFebruary 16, 1853 ~ Wednesday16th Meeting commenced at 10 oclok Brother Greward who had been to the Islands on a mission preached in the forenoon gave an account of his mission & closed up by speaking & saying the Lords prayer in the Tahitain language. I was not present at his discourse so I could not write itA Lyman followed at some length said he had no Different feelings abot the seventies than he had abot the Elders or High priestHe was no more partial to one than the other He did not know of any ordination that was of any benefit to him aside from his own exheriton He never boasted of any office he had He wished to live in such a manner that I can say to all men follow me I dont wish to be under the necessity of citing evry body to follow Brother Young or Brother Kimball I want to be able to say to all follow me as I follow Christ many other remarks were made by Brother LymanBrother Coleburn made some remarks said he was baptize by BrotherBrigham Young in 1833 was ordained an Elder by Joseph SmithBrother Joseph Young addresed the meeting wished all might soon be enabled to govern themelvs I am president of the Seventies & the quorums were set in order by Joseph Smith & I suppose it is right their is a president over each quorum of the seventies And I want evry president to keep their quorums in orderit is the privilege & duty of evry president to try & cut off any member of his quorum if they are worthy of it I dont want to be to slow or two fast but as near the line as I can get. And I wish others to do the same I wish All the seventies to take the Desarett News & read it & let your children read it & put it in your library & preserveit. I also want you to sharpen up your swords & keep your arm in order & learn the art of war and I want all to do military dutyJoseph once said if we did not keep our arms in order an enemis might come upon us as unawares & destroy us but if we are prepared we need not fear I was at the slaghter at Hauns mill I dont want to see any more of it. I also want the Seventies to pay up their tithingit has now become a matter of Church fellowship & I hope you will not forget itE T Benson followed was rejoiced to hear what he had it had warmed up his hart I wich to obey the Lord & fulfill my calling we have had good counsel & we will do well to follow it we are about to begin another Temple I epect the devil will be mad I dont care if 
 we dont stay hare a month if the Lord wants we should go away when I look back to the days of Nauvoo & compare them with these days A [I] am satisfyed that evry move we make is for our good many said then we could not travel but would be destroyed Brother Brigham said we could Journey & not a man be lost & it has proved true we are here & in a good situation yet if ye will live godly in Christ Jesus ye shall suffer persecution this Kingdom has to be built up by manual labour I hope this people will soon be in a situation to live by their own resources & not trust to the Gentiles some dont pray but a man can no more live without praying than they can without bread if you dont keep the commandments of God the devil with use you for his deciple. Blessings will not stick upon an unfaithful man but they will upon one that is faithful. let us pray in secret as well as in the family circle any body that dont know that mormonism is true is not fit to send on a mission the priest of the day say they preach from the bible I tell them they dont know that it is true it is true but I know that mormonism is trueErastos Snow followed & said that he was glad to hear what was said it was good I am glad to see the seventies together you have as much of a calling as you can fulfill dont wish for any greater calling the day has come when this body of men will be called into immediate action & if evry one of you could be in 20 places at once you would find enough to do it is better to wear out than to rust out the Seventies are the bone & sinnew of Israel the Battle Ax of the Almighty what a mighty influence they must wield in Israel & the world we are begining to become one as a people Joseph said he had got a lever under the earth & he ment to turn it over that it might be right side up the seventies I expect will do much towards turning it overit is for our best interest to build up the Kingdom of God & do his willErastus Snow followed Meeting continued through the evening some two New quorums of seventies was organized during the evening but I was not present & could not give particulars but the evening closed up the meeting for business preaching &cFebruary 17, 1853 ~ Thursday17th I spent the day at home writingFebruary 18, 1853 ~ Friday18th I spent the day at home the west side Jordon hunting for my horses & cows found my cows but not my horsesFebruary 19, 1853 ~ Saturday19 I spent the day at home choring & writingFebruary 20, 1853 ~ Sunday20th Sunday Erastus ^Snow^ addressed the meeting & spoke well He said [FIGURE] if he spoke to their edifycation it would have to be by their prayers & faith he said he felt dull & did not feel as he did while in the vineyard preaching he felt he said as the little boy at sea in the storm his Father was captain of the ship & had the helm & all were afraid of being lost the boy was asked why he was not afraid he replyed that he had no fear for dada had the helm & their was no danger so I fell H[◊◊] dada has the helm here so their is no danger He spoke of his mission in denmark the Lord showed him that the King & counsel was taking counsel against him to 
 to stop his preaching he herd their conversation in a night vision but he said as I kept the Law & my brethr[en] they could find no accusation against me. He exhorted the Saints to faithfulness & said many interesting things He was followed by presidet Young[FIGURE] President Brigham Young arose & said he does appreciate the blessings we enjoy. There is no other people on earth that enjoy as great blessings in the gospel of Jesus Christ. Some suppose that no people but ourselves have enjoyed the light of the Lordno other people do enjoy the fulness of the gospel but all men more or less have had the light of the Lord as he hwas LIts light that enlight[en]ed evry man that cometh into the world. we are now living in the times of times the dispansation of all dispansation none have put it down no matter how it may be disspiced it is the Kingdom of God on the Earth hear in our midst. now ask yourselves the question are you as happy as you expeted you would be when you got to Zion have you got what you anticipated you would get All the world cannot disprove this to be the Kingdom of God Here the Saints are gathered from the states England & other parts of the world what were your feelings while there it was if I could ownly get to the valley with the Saints I would be satisfyed for I cannot bear to stay in the wicked world & hear the blasphemes of the people but I want to be with the saints, well now are you not with the saints & are you not the saints then are you happy whad did you anticipate why it was that there would the blesed Saints dwell whare there would be no more sin or wickedness and I shall bask in the smiles of my Lord well how is it now is it as you anticipated what henders your enjoying all that you anticipated I can answer it for myself if I dont have all the light truth Joy & happiness & glory that I anticipated [it] is because of my vary self and my will prevents me. All hell cannot hender me if I am right from enjoying all that I expect. If any other man does wrong trespasses steals my polls fence or any thing els it is no reason whyI should do wrong again, because my neighbor does an evil It is no reason why I should do an evil in all the days of my life & say that man that will do right in all things let his Neighbor do as he may shall have heaven here. Who has got power to che[a]t me out of my crown, Glory, Heaven, Kingdom, &c who is it that has an influence over you who is it ^[◊]^ will deprive you of all that you expect nobody but yor own selves And any body that does not know enough about salvation to judge what to do when you are instructed continually are not capable of receiving a Celestial Kingdom they are not worthy of it No one that cannot preside over themselves is not worthy of it but it is those who are valient in the Testimony of Jesus Christ & bring themselves in subjection to the Law of Christ& say I will serve God let others do as they may.Another question I will do all I can to ask the Lord for wisdom all the day long & if I do right am i not capapble of knowing things for myself I am. when the people first went to Jackson Co they thought if they could ownly get there they would be in glory nearly all seemed anxious. to get there I did not go myself but went into the world & preached the gospel to the people but by & by the people in 
 that place had more trouble than we did. but I now will ask if they suffered in their feelings as much asthey would have done if they had anticipated the trouble & known it before No, for they could not bear it the anticipatin of trouble or happines is far beyongd thereality in this life. Some think they could not bear the troubles that this Church have passed throgh, but I have passd through it & bourn it well enough & never felt better than I have in the midst of the persecutions of the SaintsWe talk of sacrafize do we sacrafize in the building of this Kingdom If I had millions & used it in the building of this Kingdom bwould it be sacrafize NoIf I was called to go & preach the gospel all the days of my life & never see my family again it would not be sacrafize what is our reward for our labour & faithfu-lness it is Thrones, Kingdoms, principalities Eternal Lives & a seat among the Gods then is it sacrafice No such thing I believed that all would be better to gather togethewith the saints than to remain in the world I thought all wou-ld be honest I laid aside all my account Books I thought I should not need to keep any accounts with the saints but I have found it quite different many do not fell disposed to pay their debts if they can gag red [get rid] of it. many of the saints are fearful. The little time that I talked on the stand to Judge Bro-cchus their was more suffering in the flesh ^&^ in spirit in the few minutes & for months afterwards than you would suffer in reality in years of persecution many in their imagin-ation saw us all hung, shot, drown murdered massacred in evry imaginable shape that you could think off & one reaso[n]that you suffer so much more than you expected here in Zion is you have brought yourselves with you but at last you will lay down self & it will go to the dust now I want to give a text for evry body to preach from & that is take a course to restore confidence throughout the whole land of Zion & the whole kingdom of God let confi-dence be restored to all men by an upright course of life & doing right unto all & practice it commencewith your family your children. If you give your childany thing for instence a trunk to put their things in dont never go to that trunk or disturb those things in any wisewithout the special leave of your child so by your wife anything that she possesses or that you give her never disturb that or take any thing that is hers without her leave so let the wife do by the Husband never disturb any thingthat is his without his leave so with children theyshould never touch any thing that is their parentswithout their leave. I never opened a trunk belong[ing]to one of my wives in my life but once & that was to get a portrait to send to the states as I could not wait for her to return before the messenger left then from your families let this principle go through your neighborhood & throughout the whole Kingdom of God pay all men what youowe them fulfill your promises and if your Neighbors Horse ox cow or any thing that he has is suffering by your door feed it & save its life as you would if it was your own 
 and then let your Neighbors woods poolls fence & evry thing he has got alone & let all of mine alone & I will yours And in this way you will restore confidence dont trespass uponany body but do right & the blessings of God will attend youBrother Richards said owe no man any thing I owe gratitude to God & to all mankigd in a measure but in a measure or anoth[er] sens owe no man any thing but do right in all things & you will have all the Heaven & Zion that you can enjoy in this worldFebruary 21, 1853 ~ Monday221st [FIGURE] I spent this day in Company with President Young and had a vary plesant agreeable day with him I dined with him in company with E.

He said some Elders would threaten to curse their wives if they did not obey him because he had the priesthood He said the curses of such men wer of no force & the women need have no fears of itHe said again some men had a desire to stick to the work because it made them kings & priest so they couldsway a great septer & rule with a rod of Iron & damn menhere & curse them there &sc and had not in view theprinciples of Justice Jud[g]ment mercy truth &c but they cou[l]dnot arise upon such principle even God himself shouldHe act upon this principle He would scease to be God for the principls that sustain him & his Throne would forsake him & he would scease to be God for light & truth & evry other good principle cleaves unto itself 
 And these all sustain the throne of God & He sustains themHe & all righteous men love the truth for the truth sake & embrace it & maintain it because it is just & true not because it gives them power to rule with a rod ofIron Some men want women sealed to them at the same time they will steel my property I want such men to go to Calafornia as soon as possible for they willgo to Hell any how who should have women sealed tothem those men who have proved to God Angels & manthat they are willing to do any thing that God requires of themat the sacrafice of all their own private interest orfeelings & have been faithful all the day long such should have women sealed to them for they will be saved. I ha[v]e told the brethren that all good men might have this privilgebut they must be their own Judges if men ask for thisprivilege & abuse it they sell their birth right like Esau they cannot never regain it in all Eternity men that have wom[en]sealed to them & abuse them & turn them out doors & treat lightly those sacred things given unto them it will prove a curse unto them then beware O ye people how ye treat the thi[n]gs of God that are committed unto you. for many will wake up from an awful dream & find themselves wifeless & childless in the morning of the resurrection who thought they hadpossessions, for they will sceace to increase & when they scease to increase they will decrease the diff[ere]n[c]e between Christ & the devil is Christ will increase & the devil will decrese untill Christ will have power to destroy death & him that hath the power of death which is the devil yes the devil will finally be destroyed & disorganized & will scease to exhist as a devil & the Elements of which he is composed will go back into its mother Element & the Devil will scease to be & so will his Angels & evry thing that does not increase will decreas untill it will be disorganzd & he expressed it as hisopinions that there were many who had a tabernacle on Earth that would never have a resurrection many otherinteresting remarks were made by the speakerFebruary 28, 1853 ~ Monday28 I spent the day on the Temple blockMarch 1, 1853 ~ TuesdayMarch 1st 1853 This is my birth day I am 46 years of Age this day this birthday finds me having charge of the tithing hands in commencg to prepare for the building of ano[t]h[er]Temple to the Name of the most high God may the Lord enable us to finish itMarch 2, 1853 ~ Wednesday to March 5, 1853 ~ Saturday2, 3, 4 & 5 I spent this week on the Temple blockMarch 6, 1853 ~ Sunday6th Sunday I attended Meeting.

Prophets & Apostles & all the saints are edefyed when they hear an Elder preach by the spirit of Godthe Devil would strive to make you believe that you couldnot preach & He would take all of the spirit of God from you if he could. I will tell you what the Lord & the prophets & Apostles want of all of the Elders & that is that you live in such a manner that you may be filled with fire so that you can preach or pray & be filled with the power of God so as to Edify all. Brother Clawson says that I am not capable of Edifying this people what does thissay that I have been in the dark Now I will give you the key [FIGURE] so that you will know how to improve all the lessons you have to take do right live so that you will have the spirit of God dont do wrong in any thing dont get Angry be slow to judge of your neighbor Now the key is to live so close to God that He cannot hide his face from you if you do not you will always be dull scholars all yourlives you must walk in the light of the Lord or you cannot Edify & do good you must do it. A man that is in his place can see all that is going on as well as I could stand on an eminance & see all that is going on on my farm. There is no more need of getting mad crossingthe plains or in the canyons than their is while setting in a Rocking Chair or in this Stand if you have the Spirit of God & keep it then you can learn what their is to be known. you should pray go to God live in the spirit of God untill you are full & your bones are filled with fire.I am fully satisfyed with what God has given me I am always satisfyed with what I have had. I Have had the spirit of God to lead me while in England as Joseph had in America for we have the same God to Assist us in one place as in anoth[er] & this will be the case with the Elders in all the worldIn speaking of the Revolutionary war said we would not have any national feeling against our brother or any good manSeptember 25, 1853 ~ Sunday to September 30, 1853 ~ Friday25 to 30 I spent the time ploughing & sewing wheatOctober 1, 1853 ~ SaturdayOct 1st [FIGURES] I Received one letter from I F Carter & wrote 1 Letter to J M Bernhisel
