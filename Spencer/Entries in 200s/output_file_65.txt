Not ownly of the gospel of Christ, and  Kingdom of God, but of the judgments of God  and Events which await this generation  I know not how long I shall live, or dwell in  the flesh, and I feel it my duty to bear  my testimony (though feeble) as an Apostle  of Jesus Christ before I die, that my garments  may be clear of the Blood of all men as far  as can be. And what I have written I have  penned as I felt moved upon by the Spirit  of God.

Smith, I learn that the St. John  people propose selling out to us,  and afterwards occupying the  Colorado Meadows a body of grass  land extending along the Colorado  River. Now I beleive that, our peo-  ple should immediately occupy   those Meadows which are ten  miles long and will average two  miles in width. By securing them  our people could control the hay

Bro Tenney  Has visited the settlements before and Had in  some measure opened the way & formed  acquaintances so that we were able to Hold some  meetings among them and we were very kindly  received & entertained in all places that we went  and we are satisfied there is no better field  open for labor for a class of wise men than  there is among that people one or two men  cannot do much alone in Breaking the bands  of Catholocism that Has bound those tribes for  generations but with a continued effort of a  company of the Elders of isreal it can be done    they are allready becoming tired of their religion and  are loocking for something better I Herein insert  a list of names for your consideration a part of  which can allready speak the Spanish and others  can soon learn it.

 you do not approve of that it may  be withhedld, for I would not wish to  Publish to the world my document of  that kind without the consent of my  Quorum the Apostles, and whatever  you do approve of I would like to have  published in the publication of the Saints  The spirit of God will bear record to   you whether I was dictated by the spirit  of God or not, Also whether the things  written therein are true or false. The  spirit has intimated to me that as the  Apostles of the Lamb of God are ^so^ fast  passing away that wisdom whispers  that it is ^our^ duty as Apostles to bear our  Testimony as far as possible of the king-  dom of God, and of the Judgments of  God, which await this Generation that  the wicked shall be left without excuse  in the day of their calamity, and overth-  row. I feel pressed in spirit, and I am  greatly mistaken if there is not a great  change on our doors with both Zion   and Babylon: I would to God, the Saints  were united as they should be, that we  might ^have^ power with the Heavens, that our  Prayers might be Effectual if my testimony  which will be presented to you is accepted   will you do me the favor to have it presented  to the Editors of the News for for publication.

 May 10th    Brothe Taylor    As our letters ly by us days and sometime weeks before we can get to the  office, I feel disposed to give an outline of events since the date of my letters. I will say  concerning the farms that the Agent John W sent to Buy the farms, returned ^having^ hay accomplished  the work But He was None to soon, for she had 3 offers, 2 from Garths & and  from Broth Johnson the ferry man. He & one Gentile offered $4006 each, & one Gentile  $5000 and they are Determining to get ^it^ but she had promised John W the ferry  for $3000 & she said she would stand by her promise, papers of contra^c^t  we sent her to sign But she sent the Gentile with her son to MoenCopy  to receve the stock portion of pay, the contract was for $2500 in stok &  property & $500 in cash. John W let them have a New waggon & the Brother  united with him in turning out stock is all here to the Amount of same  $1200, a part on tithing & I go to Sun Set to met with Lot Smith   (as soon as I am able to ride) to get the part of the stok there and in hope  to get the most on tithing and the cash will have to the paid in S.

 W. Woodruff, 12 Jan 1878  Report regarding Jos. H. Ridges.    Nephi 12 Jan 1878    President John Taylor  Salt Lake City    Dear Brother    We arived here all safe.  There is a subject that I wished to say  a few words about and that is ^to^ make  a Report about Brother Ridges on the   Organ. I called the day before I left at  the Tabernacle upon Brother Olson. He  gave me to understand that Brother Ridges  had not done any work during December  and but Little during November and  in fact no steady work on that Organ  hardly doing any of he month that He   had charged the Church 8 dollars a day  and when He did work one third or one  half of the time ^was^ on chairs, deskes and 
 market in this region, including Forts  Wingate and Apache, and securing  an aextensive cattle range this region  where bottom grass, is so scarce.  There would be nothing but the gov-  ernment price of the land required    We have at present ^we have^ but one  man, Bro T. L. Greer, to occupy  this extensive field. He fully beleives  that grain can be raised without  irrigation, upon those bottoms where  the water is near the surface and  breaks forth in small springs in  many places. Bro Greer also  thinks that an abundance of   water can be saved in a reser-  voir  that ^can^ be built in a natural  basin. I desire this subject consid-  ered in connection with my  former letter. The settlements here  need these meadows for dairies    and milk ranches, but have no  men to pspare to take them up    I think, if a company should  be sent expressly to occupy these  places they would take hold and  be satisfied, and do good. Some  come scattering along, and com-  mence rambling around looking  for places, these cannot be depend-  ed upon to do much good.    Bro Lake is fast recovering, but  Bro. Bates is still very sick    The sooner a company can come  for settling these desirable places,  we think, the better for our people    Your brethren in the Gospel  W W  Jesse N. Smith

Again, I have a Nephew in Logan, named  Edward E. Hyde, who is secretary of the Agricultural College   and also teaches in the college certain days in the Week, and who   is a nice young man and yet single, in talking with my Sister, "his  Mother," on Saturday, she expressed a great desire to have him sent on a mission.

Galbraith, Colonia  Diaz, near La Ascencion, Chihuahua  Mexico, and 3rd Anson B. Call, Colonia  Dublan, near Casas Grandes, Chihua-  hua, Mexico. The first two are single  men sons of Bros. W. R. R. Stowell and  William W. Galbraith. The last named  is a married man. We present these names  for your consideration to choose one, two or   all of them as the Lord will.    Your Brother,  George Teasdale.    Let us have them all,  for when most needed. J. F. S.

We also have a young man here, by the name of   Walace Cragan, who is now Teaching School in Box Elder  County, who would make a splendid missionary to Germany,   and who has a Father and several Brothers who can help him while   away, and I believe him to be anxious "if sent," to go to Germany.  he so expressed himself to me over a year ago. he and my Nephew  would make a good pair for that country. I have more names  to present soon who would make good missionaries, and be   able to do us more good when they return and themselves also, than they   now can, we have 14 or 15 returned missionaries working in our   Sunday School who are all a great credit to the School and   themselves, and I am extreemly anxious to be preparing more good   help as fast as possible. these two young men's school will be out in June  next, and can go then just as well as not.    with very kind wishes to you and Prest Cannon and Smith  and all your familie's I am as ever your Bro in the Gospel    Geo L.

 Stayner for conducting the   business for him and the  incidental expenses of the   trip, etc.  Now, Bro' Teasdale,  it has occured to me what   a good thing it would be   to have a temple or an   Endowment House erected  at some eligible point where  the Saints living in Mexico,  Arizona and New Mexico  could go and recieve their  endowments and sealings.  This tithing I speak of would  greatly help towards building   a suitable house in which to   attend to those sacred ordinances.  Would it not be well to   confer with President Wilford  Woodruff, his counselors, and the   Twelve in regard to this matter?

 Kanesville Jany 28th 1850    Dear Bro Woodruff  Your letter of Decr 6th has just come to   hand; and in answer I would say that it is ever pleasing to me to get  a letter from you, whither it is short or long.    My great objection to many letters is, they are very lengthy upon matters  that are of no interest to me or themselves. I am ever willing to hear a long  letter upon any matter of importance, either to myself or to the writer: but when   I get a long string of questions whether the writer belonged to the tribe  of Judah or Joseph, and whether he should go to Jerusalem, or to Zion-  or whither he could redeem his dead now or hereafter, and a thousand  and one things about some old thread bare experience, thirty years ago.  These and the like things are what annoy me.    With regard to your appointing a presiding Elder over the remains   of the Eastern churches before you leave, I would say that you,  are acquainted with the conditions of things there better than I am, and  you have unquestionably got your Eye upon some person as the individual  to fill that place, should you deem it expedient to appoint a presiding  Elder. Consult your own Knowledge of things, the circumstances and   condition in which men, and things are placed in that country, and act  according to your own conviction before the Lord, and it will be right.  The Keys of the apostleship are with you, and you were sent into that  country to take charge, and none are so capable of giving advice   to the remaining Saints there, as yourself.    The price of wagons suitable for a trip over the mountains, will be  from 50 to 80 dollars—good work cattle will probably be from 50  to 80 dollars a yoke (very high because scarce, and in great demand)  Wagons may be had here I think, but oxen and cows had better

To the Saints Scattered Abroad, Greet-  ing:    DEAR BRETHREN:-I feel desirous to   express myself upon the present con-  dition of Zion and its inhabitants.  The history of which we are making as  Latter-day Saints is strictly in fulfil-  ment of the revelations of God, as   given through the mouths of Prophets  and inspired men to the inhabitants   of the earth in every dispensation   when God has had an acknowledged   people on the earth. The God of   heaven, who created this earth and  placed His children upon it, gave   unto them a law whereby they might   be exalted and saved in a kingdom of   glory. For there is a law given unto   all kingdoms, and all things are  governed by law throughout the   whole universe. Whatever law any-  one keeps he is preserved by that   law, and he receives whatever re-  ward that law guarantees unto him.  It is the will of God that all His chil-  dren should obey the highest law,  that they may receive the highest   glory that is ordained for all immor-  tal beings. But God has given all   His children an agency to choose   what law they will keep.    These two principles do exist—  good and evil; God and the Devil.   Whatever leads to good and to do  good is of God. Whatever leads to   evil and to do evil is of the Devil.  God has labored from the creation of   man to lead him to keep the celestial   law, that he may inherit a celestial   glory and partake of eternal life, the  greatest of all the gifts of God to man:   while the Devil, with all the fallen  angels, has labored from the creation   to lead man astray, to lead him down  to the perdition of ungodly men, that   he may have dominion over him.    These two principles have governed  and controlled the acts of all the chil-  dren of men, and laid the foundation  for all the history of the whole world  for the last six thousand years, or   from the creation of man. This   power of the Devil, and of all the   fallen angels, who are represented to   have been one-third part of all the  hosts of heaven, who were cast down  from heaven to earth, has been at   war against God and His Christ, and   against every Prophet and Apostle  and inspired man whom God has  raised up, from the creation of the   world to the present day. The first   man, Adam, under the influence of   the Devil, transgressed a law by   which death came into the world.  God the Eternal Father gave His only  begotten Son, as a great sacrifice, to   shed His blood to redeem man from   death. For as in Adam all die, even  so in Christ shall all be made alive.    The God of heaven, whom we wor-  ship, is represented as the Father,   the Son and the Holy Ghost. The  Father and Son have tabernacles, and   they created man after their own  image. But the Holy Ghost is a  spirit and a witness and a testimony   of the Father and the Son. This   Holy Ghost and witness are promised  unto all men who will obey the law   of the Gospel, which God has re-  vealed to the human family. This   Holy Ghost rested upon Adam when   he blessed in posterity in Adam-  ondi-Ahman, three years previous to   his death.    The Lord gave unto Adam and   many of his sons the Holy Priest-  hood, whereby they could administer   in the ordinances of the Gospel of  life and salvation. The Lord has   raised up men in every dispensation,   when He has had a people on earth  unto whom He has given the Priest-  hood, and all people have been   blessed when they hearkened to   the voice of the Lord. On the other  hand, when the inhabitants of the   earth have become wicked, and have  transgressed the law of God, they   have been chastised, and when they  have become ripened in iniquity they  have been cut off from the earth, as   in the case of Noah and Lot, and "as   it was in the days of Noah, so shall it  be also in the days of the Son of   Man." The righteous were saved  while the wicked were destroyed.    The whole history of the dealings   of the Lord with man has shown the  benefits and blessings of obeying the  Lord and keeping His command  ments. The history of the dealings   of the Lord with ancient Israel shows  that He blessed the righteous and   cursed the wicked and brought His   judgements upon them. Whenever  Israel hearkened to the teachings of   Moses and the prophets, they pros-  pered, and their enemies were a prey  unto them. But when they depart-  ed from the Lord and set up altars to   Baal, and committed sin, the Lord   forsook them, as in the case of Judah  and Jerusalem, in the days of Zede-  kiah the King. He forsook the Lord,  and led the people astray. They   were full of blood and murder and   whoredom and all manner of abomi-  nations, and the Lord warned them   through His Prophets, Isaiah, Jere-  miah and Ezekiel. These Prophets   told the king and the people what  judgments would come upon them,   and the Lord said by Ezekiel unto   the king and the people, "What I   have spoken shall be done." Now   all that these Prophets said came to  pass. Not one jot nor tittle fell un-  fulfilled. The Jews put to death the  Savior and the Apostles and rejected   the Lord and the Gospel; and all that  Moses, Jesus, the Apostles and the   Prophets spoke concerning Israel,   Judah and Jerusalem, came to pass to   the very letter.    All the Prophets and Apostles who   have written since man was placed   upon the earth have seen our day,   and have prophesied of the events   which were to take place on the earth  in the last dispensation and fullness   of times. They have seen the Church  of God, the Zion of God, and the   Kingdom of God established on the   earth, and the gathering of the peo-  ple from all nations to build them up,   and the judgments of God which   were to rest, in the last days, upon  all nations who should fight against  Mount Zion and the people of God.  Now, I wish to ask the Latter-day   Saints if they can for a moment think  that the Lord will fail in these days  in fulfilling His promises any more  than He has in other dispensations?   No; He will not.    In fulfillment of his sayings through  the mouths of those ancient Apostles   and Prophets, the Lord has set His  hand once more, for the last time, to  prune His vineyard and to establish  His Church and Kingdom upon the  earth, to be thrown down no more  forever. He has raised up His Pro-  phets and Apostles and revealed unto   them the fulness of the everlasting   priesthoods of Aaron and   of Melchisedek. Joseph Smith was   raised up by the power of God, and   the administration of angels, and he   brought forth the Book of Mormon,   the record and stick of Joseph in the  hands of Ephraim, as spoken of by   the Prophet Ezekiel in the 37th chap-  ter. This Prophet of God, Joseph  Smith, had power to organize the  Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day   Saints, according to the ancient or-  der of the Church of Christ, with   Apostles and Prophets, Evangelists,   Bishops, Pastors and Teachers. And   the Church has been led continually   by living oracles and the revelations   of God from Heaven until the present  day. It has now stood fifty-six years   since its organization, and its history  is before the heavens and the earth.  The Prophets and Apostles and many   Elders have gone forth and preached  the Gospel of Jesus Christ to many   nations, and tens of thousands of the   inhabitants of the earth have em-  braced the Gospel, been baptized for  the remission of their sins, have re-    ceived the Holy Ghost by the laying  on of hands, and have been gathered  home to Zion from many nations, in  fulfillment of the ancient Prophets,   who spoke as they were moved upon   by the Holy Ghost. Earth and hell   have been combined to stop the little   stone from rolling, and from becom-  ing a mountain and filling the whole  earth, as Daniel said it should in the  last days. Joseph Smith, his brother   Hyrum, with several of the Apostles   and Elders and many Saints, have   already sealed their testimony with  thir blood, and to-day prisons are  crowded with the Elders of Israel for  keeping the commandments of God,  and many others have been driven   into exile for the same cause.    Many of the inhabitants of the land  are stirred up and are desirous to de-  stroy the Church and Kingdom of   God from off the earth. But they   know not the thoughts of the Lord,  neither understand they His ways.   The Gentile or Christian world to-day  can no more commit sins, and be   guilty of lying, stealing, blasphemy,  whoredoms, or murder, or commit   any abominations, and escape the   wrath of God, than could Sodom and   Gomorrah, or the antediluvian world,   or ancient Israel. The word of the   Lord has been proclaimed against the  Gentiles and all the inhabitants of   the earth in the last days who com-  mit sin, and it will as assuredly be  fulfilled as in ancient days. The Lord  has a controversy with this genera-  tion, and He will judge the inhabi-  tants according to the deeds done in   the body, and none can stay His   hand.    I want to say to the Saints of God  who dwell in the flesh to-day, that   the 56 years which have passed away  since the organization of the Church   of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,  have taken into the spirit world all   our Prophets, Apostles, Elders and  Saints, who have finished their testi-  mony in the flesh. Their voice is  hushed in death and their testimony   is closed. They are mingling with   the spirits of the righteous and wait-  ing for the great day of the coming  of the Son of Man, when Jesus Christ  will come in the clouds of heaven to   reward every man according to the   deeds done in the body. But though  they have passed away, is the work   of God finished on the earth? Verily  no. Has the warning voice ceased to  be heard by the inhabitants of the   earth? It has not. All of us who  remain in the flesh are under as much  obligation to lift the warning voice   and reap while the day lasts as   were those who have passed away.    The Lord said to Ezekiel, "I have   made thee a watchman unto the   House of Israel." "When I say unto   the wicked, Thou shalt surely die;   and thou givest him not warning, nor   speakest to warn the wicked from his  wicked way, to save his life; the same  wicked man shall die in his iniquity;  but his blood will I require at thine   hand. Yet if thou warn the wicked,  and he turn not from his wickedness,  nor from his wicked way, he shall   die in his iniquity; but thou hast de-  livered thy soul." This is precisely  our condition to-day. As Apostles,   Seventies, High Priests, and Elders,   we and all men who bear any portion  of the Holy Priesthood, are watch-  men upon the walls of Zion and mes-  sengers to all the inhabitants of the   earth, and all of us will be held re-  sponsible if we donot improve ourtime   and lift the warning voice, as far as  we have opportunity, and warn this   generation of the judgments of God   which await them.    I know the judgments of God are   very nigh unto the door of this na-  tion and this generation, and they   will overtake the world before it is  prepared for that time. Even the   coming of the Son of Man is nigh,  and he will come as a thief in the  night. Who is prepared to abide   the day of His coming? It is our   duty to labor and reap. Then every  man should be diligent in that sphere  in which he is called to act, that his   garments may be clean from the   blood of all men.    I do not believe there was ever a   generation of men who inhabited the   earth who were more wicked, or who   were practising greater abominations,   or who were sinning against greater   light and knowledge, or who had a   greater flood of judgments proclaimed   against them by the word of the  Lord, than the generation in which we live.  Therefore, as Saints of the living God,   who bear the Holy Priesthood, we shall  be under condemnation if we do   not lift up the warning voice against the  evils and abominations which ex-  ist, so far as we have opportunity.   How many woes the Prophets   and Apostles have proclaimed against   those who fight against Zion. "Woe   unto all those who discomfort my   people, and drive and murder them,  and testify against them, saith the  Lord of hosts. A generation of vipers  shall not escape the damnation of   hell. Behold, mine eyes see and   know all their works, and I have in  reserve a swift judgment, in the sea-  son thereof, for them all. For there   is a time appointed for every man,  according at his work shall be."    I will say to the Apostles, our re-  sponsibility is very great. The   Prophets who organized the Church  and laid the foundation of this last  dispensation, with a whole quorum  of Apostles, have finished their testi-  mony had gone into the spirit world.  We have been called to take their   places. What manner of men ought   we to be? The whole earth is ripen-  ing in iniquity, and the Zion of God  should be prepared for the coming of  the bridegroom. We should humble  ourselves before the Lord and be in a  position to be filled with the spirit of  our calling, with the Holy Ghost, and  with the revelations of Jesus Christ,   that we may know the mind and will   of God concerning us, and be pre-  pared to magnify our calling and   bring to pass righteousness, and be  valiant in the testimony of Jesus  Christ to the end of our pilgrimage,  here in the flesh. The Prophets,   Apostles, and all the heavenly hosts  are watching over us. There never   was a time when the work of God re-  quired a more faithful testimony and  labor from the Apostles and Elders  than to-day.    I would say to the Saints, who  stand connected with the quorum of  the Twelves Apostles, as messengers   to the nations of the earth, it has   fal,en to your lot to go forth and   assist to prune the vineyard once   more, and for the last time, before  the coming of the Son of Man. The  Lord said, fifty seven years ago, that   the field was white for the harvest,   and He had set His hand to prune   the vineyard once more, and for the  last time. The Elders were com-  manded at that day to thrust in their  sickle and reap while it was called  to-day, for soon night would come,   when no man could reap. Brethren,  it is much nearer night now than it   was fifty seven years ago. The Savior  said at that day, that the angels were   crying day and night for  the privilege to go forth and reap   down the earth. He informed them they  must wait a little season until  the harvest was fully ripe. The na-  tions must be warned, Zion must be   established, and the wheat, or the   Saints, be gathered into the garner,   then the angels might go forth and  reap the tares, gather them in bun-  bles and prepare them for the burn-  ing.    Since that day many thousands of   the Saints have been gathered to   Zion from the nations of the earth.   But you are called upon at this late  day to still go forth and warn the   Gentiles with the proclamation of  the Gospel. Therefore, brethren,   you who are called to go into the   vineyard, whether Apostles, High  Priests, Seventies, or Elders, do not   be weary in well doing. Remember,  you are messengers of salvation.  Keep yourselves pure and spotless    before God and all men. Seek to   bring to pass righteousness, and save  the souls of men. Labor faithfully  that your garments may be clean   from the blood of all men, and that  the nations may be left without ex-  cuse in the day of God's judgments  upon the wicked, which is nigh at  hand, and those judgments will be  poured out without measure.    All the messengers in the vineyard   should be righteous and holy men,  and call upon the Lord in mighty   prayer, in order to prevail. It is the   privilege of every Elder in Israel,   who is laboring in the vineyard, if  he will live up to his privileges, to  have dreams, visions, and revelations,  and the Holy Ghost as a constant   companion, that he may be able tho-  roughly to gather out the blood of   Israel and the meek of the earth and  bring them into the fold of Christ.    It is true that the Elders who are   called to bear record of the Gospel of   Christ to the nations of the earth are   many times called to pass through   prosecutions for the Gospel's sake,   and in some instances to lay down   their lives, as did the ancient Saints,  and quite a number in our day, for   Christ's sake. But there seems to be  a special crown of glory laid up for  every man who is martyred for Christ's  sake and the Gospel's. No   matter in what age of the world he  lays down his life for Christ's, he will  find it again, and eternal life in the   world to come. Therefore, brethren,   let us be diligent in our labors in this   last hour in the vineyard. The Lord  said to Oliver Cowdery, if he labored   all the days of his life and saved but   one soul, how great would be his joy   in the Kingdom of Heaven with that   one soul. We have everything to en-  courage us in our labors in the vine-  yard of the Lord.    While this labor is going on among  the nations of the earth, there is a  great labor and responsibility resting  upon the whole ministry who dwell  in Zion. There is labor sufficient for  every man who bears any portion of   the Holy Priesthood in the various  capacities in which the brethren are   called to act. The High Priests,  whose calling is to preside, are called  upon to officiate in Zion as High   Councilors, Presidents of Stakes and  Counselors, Bishops and Counselors,  Superintendents of Sabbath Schools   and mutual improvement associa-  tions. In every capacity in which   they are called to act, they have an  immense field in which to improve  their talents and magnify their call-  ings. Here is where the High Priests   are mainly called to preside, officiate  and labor.    There never was a time when the  Holy Priesthood, in all its various   branches, offices and labors, had a  greater work to perform than in our   day. The searching out of iniquity,   the purifying, sanctifying and cleans-  ing of the people, the uniting of the  Saints and the general perfecting of  Zion resting upon the brethren and   the Holy Priesthood who dwell in   Zion.    The whole Church, both priest and  people, should give diligent heed to  the late Epistle of the First Presiden-  cy, which has been published to the   world. The counsel they have given   upon the various items they have re-  ferred to should be strictly carried   out. The breaking of the Sabbath   day and pleasure excursions upon  that day should not be indulged in   by the Latter-day Saints. The Pres-  idents of Stakes and their counselors,  the Bishops and their counselors,  whose immediate duty it is to watch  over the stakes and wards, have a  great responsibility and duty to per-  form. Iniquity must be sought out.   Zion cannot prosper when sin and in-  iquity are permitted to dwell in her   midst.    One of the most important and re-  sponsible fields of labor in Zion is  that committed to the care of those  who preside over and teach in the   primaries, Sabbath schools, and im-  provement associations, and those  who are teaching private day schools  among the Latter-day Saints. Who  can comprehend the result of the la-  bor performed by the Elders of Israel   in these branches? No man, unless  filled with the revelations of Heaven  and the inspiration of Almighty God.   We send out hundreds of Elders, who  go to the nations of the earth to   preach the Gospel of Christ. After   spending two of three years as mis-  sionaries, if they have converted a  dozen souls and brought them into   the Church, they think they have  done a good work, which they cer-  tainly have. But here, the Elders   who are presiding over and teaching  in these institutions in Zion, filled  with the children of the Saints, have  an army of immortal souls before   them to guide and teach, and to di-  rect their minds, that they may   be qualified to step forth and take  hold of the Church and kingdom of   God and build it up and bear it off   triumphantly, after their fathers and   elders are laid in the tomb. O what a  mission is given to the sons of Eph-  raim, the Elders of Israel, the Latter-  day Saints! To warn the whole world of  the judgments which are to come,  preach the Gospel to all people, gath-  er the saints from all nations, build   up Zion, and prepare for the coming   of the Son of Man, standing in holy   places, while judgments waste the   wicked.    There is one admonition of our  Savior that all the Saints of God  should observe, but which, I fear, we   do not as we should, and that is, to   pray always and faint not. I fear, as  a people, we do not pray enough, in   faith. We should call upon the Lord  in mighty prayer, and make all our   wants known unto Him. For if He   does not protect and deliver us and   save us, no other power will. There-  fore our trust is entirely in Him.   Therefore our prayers should ascend  into the ears of our heavenly Father  day and night.    I want to say a few words to our  brethren who are in prison, or under  bonds, or driven into exile for our   religion, or for keeping the command-  ments of God. You should not think   that any strange thing has happened   unto you. Persecution is a legacy   that has been handed down from  father Adam to our day. It was said  of old that all men who lived godly   in Christ Jesus should suffer perse-  cution. If we meet with no persecu-  tion in our day, we shall hardly feel   at home when we go into the spirit   world and meet with the ancient   prophets and with Christ and the  Apostles, who passed through   much persecution and tribulation. Many   of them were crucified or otherwise  put to death. They sealed their tes-  timony with their own blood, as was   the case with Joseph and Hyrum and  several of the Apostles, Elders, and  Saints in our day.    As Elders of Israel, while we are  passing through these afflictions, let us   not cherish revenge or hatred   in our hearts towards our persecutors.  "Vengeance is mine; I will repay,   saith the Lord." Jesus Christ, the  Son of God, when nailed to the cross,  and while in the agony of death, cried,   "Father, forgive them; for they know  not what they do." Why did  He say this to His Father in Heaven?  Because the Son of God knew full   well what would be the result of  His death upon the heads of His mur-  derers. He knew what awaited the  whole Jewish nation, when that peo-  ple said, "Let His blood be on us   and on our children." He fully com-  prehended the great suffering that   awaited the Jews and their posterity   for the next eighteen hundred years.  He knew that all that Moses and the  Prophets, as well as what He had  spoken Himself, against the Jewish  nation, would come to pass; for God   had spoken it through them, and   his words never fail.    No infidel on earth can deny the   fact that Jerusalem was overthrown,  the foundation of the Temple dug up   and not one stone left upon another.    The Jews fell by famine, by pestilence  and by the sword, until twelve hun-  dred thousand dead bodies were car-  ried through the gates outside of the   walls of Jerusalem during the dis-  tress of the siege under Titus, and a   remnant was taken captive and scat-  tered throughout the world among   the Gentile nations, and the Jews  have been a hiss and a byword, and  have been trampled under the feet  of the Gentiles until the present day,  and the end is not yet, the yoke is  not yet broken from off their necks.    All this has come to pass in fulfil-  ment of the Word of God to the   Jewish nation. So I say to all my  brethren who are in exile, or in  prison, for the Gospel's sake, or for  keeping the commandments of God,  do not harbor any vengeance of ha-  tred against this nation, or against   those who have aided or abetted in  your sufferings, but rather go before  the Lord and pray that He will sof-  ten the hearts of the rulers of the na-  tion, that they will give unto the   Latter day Saints the same rights and   privileges in the worshiping of God   according to the dictates of their own  consciences as are guaranteed by the   Constitution of our Government,   which was given by the inspiration  of the God of heaven for a wise pur-  pose in Himself.    If I am asked why I make this re-  quest of my brethren, I answer,   for the same reason that Jesus said,   "Father, forgive them; for they know  not what they do." For as the God   of heaven fulfilled all His words  which He spoke concerning Judea  and Jerusalem, so will He fulfill all   that He has spoken concerning the   Gentiles and all the nations of the  earth in the last days.    I will here say, as truly as the God of   heaven lives, and has established   His throne on high, just so truly   will He bring to pass the fulfilment   of His words. He will pour out that   flood of judgments upon our nation  and upon all the nations of the earth,  which has been proclaimed by every   inspired man since the world began.  The seals will be opened, the plagues  poured out, and Great Babylon will  fall. This generation has been warn-  ed for the last fifty years by inspired   and righteous men, and after their  testimony will come the testimony of   thundering, of lightning, of floods,   of earthquakes, and of pestilence,   and famine, and war, and the flames  of devouring fire, for by fire and by  sword will the Lord plead with all   flesh and the slain of the Lord will   be many. For the Lord has said,   "My sword is bathed in heaven, and  it shall fall upon Idumea, or the   world: and who is able to stand?"    No power on earth can stay the   hand of God in this work. The God   of heaven will teach this nation and  all other nations on earth, that He is  stronger than man. He pays no re-  gard to nations or numbers, in the  fulfillment of his purposes, for He  holds in His hand the destiny of all   men and nations, and no power be-  neath the heavens can hinder His  work. The God of Israel has set his   hand to gather His people from all   nations and build up His Church and  establish Zion in all that beauty,   power, and glory which Isaiah and   other Prophets saw, and to build up  His kingdom, which shall fill the   whole earth, and in which Jesus of   Nazareth will establish his throne   and sit thereon, and reign over the  earth for one thousand years, as the  Prophet David and other Prophets   have declared. And it will come   to pass in spite of earth and hell and all   the unbelief of the whole Christian   Gentile world. If our nation or the  Gentiles do not believe this, let them   wait and see, and they will not have  to wait long before they will see  the signs manifest of the beginning of  these things. So far as the Saints are   concerned, the Spirit of God will bear   record to their spirits as they read   these testimonies, of their truth.    I will close by quoting the testi-  mony of Ezekiel in the 24th chapter  14th verse— "I the Lord have spoken  it; it shall come to pass, and I will do  it; I will not go back, neither will I   repent; according to thy ways, and  according to thy doings, shall they   judge thee, saith the Lord God."

 My friends I marvel at the wonderous work of God in this 19th century  which he is performing in the Earth & I have the greatest desire that  all my relatives may be benefited by the same. I know of a truth  that the Lord is giving to his Church yea to the Church of Latter Day  Saints the gifts blessings & grace that the Ancients possesed yea  he hath esstablished in his Church in these last days Prophets Apostles Evangel[i]st[s]  pastors, Teachers &c. & the signs follow the believers as they did anciently  persecution not excepted yea they speak with new tongues interpet  languages lay hands on the sick & they recover the lame walk  the blind see the deaf hear they preach the gospel to the poor they  have the Administeration of Angels, Dream, & see vishions & have  the heavens opened unto them as it was unto Stephen [##Acts 7:55-56##] & find Israels  God yet to be a God of revelation yea & shout O Earth & rejoice O heavens  for he is about to reveal himself & redeem his people. These are  not idleol specalations nor fancy's of the brain but they are Eternal  truths but no more true than the Book of Mormon yes that despised  stick of Joseph in the hands of Ephraim it is a good Book it is true it is  the word of God it will stand recorded on the ARCHIVES of heaven as the  [great] revelations of God [illegible] the lies of this Adulterous generation [page stained]  swept from of the Earth by the voice of God of judgment & of burning  O my Beloved Parents I would to God that you would receieve the fullness  of the gospel of Jesus Christ that you might partake of the blessing  of the same they are great they are unspeakable & cannot be enjoyed  while out of the covenant yea the covenant which God hath Esstablished  in these la[st] days yes that covenant which hath lain breaken for centuries  on the part of man but God hath again renewed it by the administration  of Angels from heaven & bringing forth the fulness of the gospel contained  in the Book of mormon which is a fulfillment of the prophesys containd  in the Bible also by esstablishing the priesthood again that priesthood  that is after the order of Melchisedec the same priesthood that the Apostles  stood in in the days of Christ & being ordained under his hand they  were prepared to administer in the ordinances of the gospel as Christ  was a high Priest himself which qualified him to ordain others to  the same priesthood. Now men have again authority to baptize & administer  in all the ordinances of the house of the Lord & now those who come  foreward & are baptized for the remishion of their sins by those who have  authority they receieve the gift of the holy Ghost by the laying on of hands as did Peter  & other Apostles [##Matthew 10:1##]

The demand for them must be great, and   it is difficult to calculate concerning the price of them exactly,  or whither they can be had plentifully at any price. If you  light of a good chance to buy oxen, horses, cows, and stock of   any kind that you want, before you get here, you had better improve  it. Then you will be sure.

 PREST. WOODRUFF'S ADDRESS.    President Wilford Woodruff was the  first speaker. He spoke as follows:    I want to say to the Latter-day   Saints that I have had quite a desire   of late to once more address you upon  some few subjects which I have upon   my mind. I have been for quite a time  under the weather as the saying is.  I have not been able to meet with the  Saints nor to do any business a good  deal of the time. But I have been   blessed of late with a little better  health.    The first subject I want to name is   the addressing of the Latter-day   Saints in this Tabernacle or in any  other assembly. There is nothing more   painful to me than to arise before five  or ten thousand people and attempt to  address them when not one in five, or  ten, or twenty, can hear what I say.  It is very difficult when this Taber-  nacle is full for any man to make  them hear. In speaking in   this Tabernacle there are  a few rules which I think every man  should observe. In the first place  he ought to preach to that post   right in the center yonder from the   time he begins till the time he gets through.  When a man who speaks from this   stand turns to the right, nobody on the  left can hear him, and when  he turns to the left, no-  body on the right can hear him,  and for men and women to sit here   hour after hour without hearing or un-  derstanding what is said, is very pain-  ful. Pardon me, brethren and sisters,   for referring to this. I perhaps am like  the rest of my brethren. I do not know   that I can make this assembly hear,   but I will do the best I can.    I was blessed with the privilege of   attending the celebration of the intro-  duction of the Pioneers into these val-  leys of the mountains. I was  very poor in health, but I   was enabled almost every day  to attend those assemblies, and  on the Pioneer day I had the privilege  of riding at the head of the Pioneer  company with several of my brethren.   The events which I was privileged   to witness during the Jubilee   week were of deep interest to me and  brought to my mind a great many   thoughts and reflections. I had the  privilege of meeting in this Tabernacle  some ten or fifteen thousand boys and   girls of the rising generation in the  midst of Israel. Among other things   I had the honor of being crowned here  by a young lady as the oldest Pioneer  of the valley. I looked upon it as a  far higher honor than being crowned  a king or a prince. All that I saw and  heard during those celebrations fur-  nished a testimony to me, and laid   with weight upon my mind the events  of the past. I viewed the adorning   and the lighting of this city in the   evenings with great delight. I have  traveled something like 175,000 miles in  over sixty years of my pilgrimage, and  I never saw in any part of the world   anything to compare with it. It is   true the nations of the earth in years  gone by have not had those appliances  that we have today in so great a   measure.    I want to refer to the contrast   between the celebration of the en-  trance of the Pioneers into this val-  ley, and the entrance of the Pioneers   itself. This celebration brought   strongly to my mind what God has   wrought in these valleys of the moun-  tains. My thoughts turn to the day   when we entered this valley, when I  drove President Young in my carriage,  he lying upon a bed of sickness. We  camped here on the east of the Knuts-  ford. We spent one night there. Presi-  dent Young slept in his bed in my   wagon one night after entering this  barren desert, and he was quite a  sick man. He said to me in the morn-  ing. "Brother Woodruff, I want to  take a walk." "All right," said I.   A number of the Twelve Apostles  were there and they got together. He  commenced to walk from our encamp-  ment across this barren desert, this  sage plain without any guide to mark  anything appertaining to the future of  the children of men in this land. Presi-  dent Young was quite feeble. He wore   his little green cloak upon his  shoulders and he walked slowly along.    As we advanced from below on to the  rising ground we came to a certain   spot where he stopped very suddenly.  He took his cane, which had a spike  in the end of it, and stuck it down into  the ground, and said, "Here shall stand  the Temple of our God." It went  through me like lightning. I did not  insult him, the Prophet of God, by ask-  ing him who told him so. What was   there here to encourage the Prophet  of God to make a remark of that kind?  What had he to trust to build a  Temple here that would cost four mil-  lions of dollars? Instead of having  around him a hundred thousand work-  ing men with millions of money in  hand, he had one hundred and forty   men. We were sore and tired and   weary, without any money in our  pockets, and still the Prophet of God  sticks his cane into the ground and  says, "Here shall stand the Temple of  our God." I asked him to stop there  till I could break a piece of sage brush  or something that I could drive down   into the place. I did nothing else un-  til I put a stake in that spot that he  marked with his cane, and then we   went on about our business. But when  I listened to his words that first night  that we spent in this barren desert, and  then he told us here was going to   stand the Temple of our God, I knew   that man spoke by the Spirit of Al-  mighty God. I knew it from the Spir-  it that was resting upon me. I was   satisfied it would all be fulfilled.    What has been the result? Before  you, he lived here. He laid the foun-  dation of that Temple, and there   stood the stake in the middle of that   Temple when it was laid out, without  any regard to his prophecies or say-  ings. These things rested with great   weight upon my mind as I looked up-  on the mighty throngs celebrating  the event of the Pioneers into the val-  leys of the mountains. There stands  that Temple today, with its spires, on   top of one of which a statue of Moroni  stands, blowing the Gospel trump   pointing to the throne of God in  heaven, in fulfillment of the prophe-  cies of Patriarchs and Prophets thou-  sands of years ago. Those are eter-  nal truths that ought to rest with  some weight upon the minds of the  Latter-day Saints.    Half an hour after the event I have  described, I heard President Young   say to Samuel Brannan, who was  urging him to leave this desert land  and go to California, "No, I am going  to stop right here; I am going to build  a city here; I am going to build a Tem-  ple here; and I am going to build a   country here." Where is the fulfill-  ment of this? It is before the eyes of  all the world today. This prophecy  has been fulfilled to the very letter.    President Young lived to dedicate  the corner stone of this Temple, and   to fulfil all that he had promised. He  not only built this Temple, but he   dictated and directed the building of  the St. George Temple at a cost of  half a million dollars. I dedicated the  lower part of that house in its first   dedication, by commandment of the  Prophet of the Lord. Brother Erastus   Snow and Brother Brigham Young Jr.  dedicated the other portion of it.   Thousands upon thousands of the liv-  ing and the dead have been blessed in  that Temple from that day until the  present. These are principles of in-  terest to me, whether they are to any-  body else or not. The Prophet of God   also laid out the Manti Temple, and  he did a thing that perhaps no other  man on the earth would have done—  he removed a mountain at the cost of  a hundred thousand dollars to  get a place that would suit him for  that Temple to stand on. That Tem-  ple was built under his direction, and   Brother Folsom superintended its con-  struction. Not only that Temple but  also the Temple in Logan was built  by his voice and counsel so long as he  lived.    These things are before the heavens   and before the earth, and the Saints   ought not to forget the blesings which   God has bestowed through His Proph-  ets who have been among us. The  Lord has set His hand to carry out  this great work. Here we have  standing in the State of Utah four  Temples, in which the Elders of Israel   are laboring to redeem their dead and  the dead of their fellow men. These   things lie with weight upon my mind.  They did during this great celebration.  To see the thousands upon thousands   come here into these valleys of the   mountains fifty years after our arrival,  it made me feel as though all the   Latter-day Saints ought to have faith  in God in His promises and revelations.  For if there is anything that has  taken place unlooked for to the whole  earth it has been the building up of   these Rocky Mountains by the Lat-  ter-day Saints, through the power of  God. But we have performed a work  so far and that, too, under the dictation  and direction of the Prophets of God   that have been sent among us. I

 think that we as Latter-day Saints   ought to understand our posi-  tion before the Lord and every  man that has got the Priesthood, every  man that has entered into covenants   with the Lord should never turn his  thoughts, his affections or his work in  any other channel than the building   up of the kingdom of God. If we do   we will miss it in the end, when we   pass to the other side of the vail.    We have everything to encourage us   in the carrying out of the purposes of   the Lord in our labors. It has been   a very remarkable period that we   have passed through during the cele-  bration of the entrance of the Pioneers  into the valley and of that which has  taken place since we came here. I am  thankful myself to God that I have  lived to see the fulfillment of these   promises of the Prophet of God. They  are great testimonies to me that the  Lord means what He says and says  what He means.    There is another principle I have up-  on my mind that I would like to speak   of. The Prophet Joseph Smith   taught the Twelve Apostles in   my day and time with re-  gard to the principle of revela-  tion. The Prophet said the  Elders of Israel would have  their minds moved upon by   the Spirit of God concerning various  things which they might not always  understand, but if they would follow  out that principle and practice upon it  it would very soon become a principle  of revelation to them. This is a true   principle and by observing it I have  been blessed all my life. Almost every  mission I have ever had in this Church  has been by the inspiration of Al-  mighty God to me. I have been led  to do this, that and the other, and  whenever I have done it I have found  the truth of God made manifest con-  cerning it. I am here today a living  man. Without heeding that principle  I would have been in the spirit world  a great many years ago. We all  should seek and labor for this prin-  ciple of revelation and get the mind   and will of God. It is very easy to do  that, if we do our duty before the Lord.    I desire to refer to myself a little in   carrying out those principles which  have been given me by the Prophet of  God. In the time of the great apos-  tasy at Kirtland, when there were so   many enemies that held the Apostle-  ship and various offices in the Priest-  hood who were at war against the   Prophet of God, I was there up to a  certain time. Right in the midst of  that apostasy the Spirit of God came  to me and told me to choose a partner  and go to Fox Islands. I knew no  more what was on Fox Islands than I  did what was on Kolob, but the Lord   said go to Fox Islands, and I selected  a partner and went. My partner was  Jonathan H. Hale. I went through   Farmington, Connecticut, my father's   abiding place, and preached there one  night. I baptized my father, my step-  mother, my half-sister, and several of  my relatives, and organized a small  branch of the Church. I then went   on my way to the Islands. When I   got to the Islands I learned what the  Lord had sent me there for. I found  a people that were searching for light  and truth. Without dwelling upon  this, I will say I had the privilege, with  my companion, of baptizing every   man and woman belonging to a Bap-  tist church there. Of course this aroused  a warfare against us. A Methodist   minister came from the South Islands  and made war against us, and I bap-  tized most of the members of   his church in a little while.  I took a large company of   them with me up to Zion after I   received word from the Prophet that  I was called of God by revelation to  fill the place of one of the Twelve.   Now, nobody told me to go to Fox  Islands except the Lord. I asked some   counsel about it and went and fulfilled  what the Lord required at my hands.    It was upon the principle of revela-  tion. It was the same when the   Twelve Apostles went to England.   They went by revelation and com-  mandment of God. Brother John Tay-  lor and myself were the two first of  the quorum to land in England.   Brother Taylor went to Liverpool, and  I went to Staffordshire. I there found  Brother Cordon with whom I stopped   and labored. We preached every  night in the week, and baptized quite  a number, and I thought we were do-  ing an excellent work. I went one  night into the town hall of Hanley  to preach to the people. Before   I got up to speak, the Holy Spirit  came to me and told me, "This is the  last meeting you will hold with this  people for many days." I did not  know what the Lord wanted of me.  We did our preaching, and we baptized   quite a number after the meeting. The  Saints asked me where I was going.   I told them I didn't know. I went and  asked the Lord what I should do and  where I should go. "Go to the south,"  was all the answer I got from the  Lord. I got into the stage and rode  eighty miles south, and the first man's  house I stopped at was John Ben-  bow's. When I got there I found a   large number of people, who had   broken off from the Wesleyan Method-  ists and other churches and who had   taken the name of United Brethren,   praying the Lord to open some door  whereby they could be enlightened in  the things of God and anxiously wait-  ing for the ancient order of things to  be res[t]ored as you and I have been in  our day. I hadn't been in his house  fifteen minutes until I understood  why the Lord had sent me. The first  thirty days I brought all that body of  people and many others into the   Church. I baptized them and their   ministers, too. I had in my hands all   their chapels, licensed according to   law. We brought into the Church over   two thousand in eight months, and  formed two or three conferences, and   many of them are now in Utah, some   of them Bishops in the Church.    I do not name this because I want   to take any honor to myself, but when   the Spirit of God tells a man to do   anything he ought to do it, and then   the blessings of God will be with him.  It has been so with me in my labors.   I have endeavored to do what the   Lord has told me. I want our Elders,  our young men that are going on mis-  sions, to learn this principle while they   are young. Learn to get the spirit of  revelation. You know what is right   and what is wrong, and the Spirit of  God will educate our young men in   these principles and they will become  mighty men in the hands of God if   they will but carry this out. This is a  principle that I feel we ought to  teach and practice. We should study  constantly to know what the mind  and will of God is concerning us, and  when we do that there will be no di-  vision among us, but we shall all be   of one heart and one mind.    Brethren and sisters, I do not feel  that I ought to talk any longer to you   this afternoon, but I thank God that I   have this privilege of meeting with you  once more in the flesh. There are many  things I do not understand, and one is  why I am here at my present age. I   do not understand why I have been  preserved as long as I have been when  so many Apostles and Prophets have   been called home. I want to bear my   testimony upon another subject. I am  the only man living in the flesh that   received endowments under the hands  of the Prophet Joseph Smith. I am   the only man in the flesh that was   with the Twelve Apostles when he   turned over the kingdom of God to  them and laid upon them the com-  mandment to bear off this kingdom.   He stood for some three hours in a   room delivering to us his last lec-  ture. The room was filled as with   consuming fire. His face was as clear  as amber; his words were like vivid  lightning to us. They penetrated every   part of our bodies from the crown of   our head to the soles of our feet. He   said, "Brethren, the Lord Almighty   has sealed upon my head every Priest-  hood, every key, every power, every   principle that belongs to the last dis-  pensation of the fulness of times, and  to the building up of the kingdom of   God. I have sealed upon your heads all  those principles, Priesthood, apostle-  ship, and keys of the kingdom of God,  and now you have got to round up   your shoulders and bear off this king-  dom or you will be damned." I do   not forget those words—I never shall  while I live. That was the last speech   he ever made in the flesh. Soon after-  ward he was martyred and called  home to glory.    I have always felt to bear my testi-  mony to the Church and to the world  concerning the truths of the Gospel of   Jesus Christ. My prayer to God is   that we may pursue a course wherein  we may be justified at the end of our   work. Our brethren that laid the  foundation of this Church and king-  dom are upon the other side of the   vail. I have no doubt myself but they  are watching with interest everything  that takes place with us here, though   to what extent is not revealed to us.   I desire, therefore, that we may all   live in that way and manner that we  may be justified and saved in the king-  dom of our God.    The Lord has set His hand to build   Zion. He is not going to fail. It mat-  ters not who opposes it, or what views   and feelings of unbelief the children of  men may have with regard to the pur-  poses of the Lord, these purposes will   all come to pass. Zion will arise and   flourish. The glory of God will rest   upon her, and she will accomplish all   that Isaiah and the other Prophets  have spoken concerning her.    God bless you all, in the name of   Jesus Christ, Amen.

Dear Brother,  Your communication notifying me of  a call to the Missionary field of  Great Britain was duly received,  and in reply submit the following  representations for your consideration.  After trying for the past ten years  to overcome the obstacles against making  a permanent home in this place, I  have given it up, and last spring  made arraigngments for the disposal  of my place and have made cal-  culations to move about the 10th of  April for Cardston or thereabouts  with what stock and implements I   have with my family.    After receiving your letter, I have well   considered the subject in connection  with my family, and still think the  best thing to do under the circumstances,  is to leave for Canada as originally   intended, believing I could better  fulfill a Mission next Spring (1896)

 with more freedom from embarassments  even in a new country, than I could  were I too leave this coming spring,  with no place for my family and   nothing for them to do during my  absence.

 Ogden July 6, 1895.    Presdt. W Woodruff. Salt Lake City    Dear Brother!    I feel it my duty to adress you these few lines,  as it appears, there is something in the way, which  prevents me, from enjoying the preveleges, and blessings  of the Gospel; and I am at a loss to learn what it is.  My reason for the above is as follows. Abouth a year  ago the seventies quorum of which I am a member  was called to furnish four missionaires for different  contries including the Netherlands.    The presidenci of my quorum consulted with me and  accepted me and forwarded my name to Salt Lake as  being fully competent as a missionaire for the Nether  lands and as in goed standing in my quorum. I belive  bishop Stratford of whose ward I am a member, and  alsoo the presidt of the stake bro L. W. Shurtliff  endorsed my name. All of the four names forwar-  ded to Salt Lake as missionaires at that time  have been accepted and are now on missions except  mine; and I have wonderd ever since what could  be the cause of my rejection. Dear brother as far   as I am aware of my former mission has been   approved of the Lord and blessed with fruits upon   myn labors. Ever since I have y[i]elded obedience  to the principels of the gospel and made covenants  with my Heavenly Father. I have tried to do  myn duties in the church laboring in every capacity
