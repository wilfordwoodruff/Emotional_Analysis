I called the day before I left atthe Tabernacle upon Brother Olson. Hegave me to understand that Brother Ridgeshad not done any work during Decemberand but Little during November andin fact no steady work on that Organhardly doing any of he month that He had charged the Church 8 dollars a dayand when He did work one third or onehalf of the time ^was^ on chairs, deskes and 
 market in this region, including FortsWingate and Apache, and securingan aextensive cattle range this regionwhere bottom grass, is so scarce.There would be nothing but the gov-ernment price of the land requiredWe have at present ^we have^ but oneman, Bro T. L. Greer, to occupythis extensive field. He fully beleivesthat grain can be raised withoutirrigation, upon those bottoms wherethe water is near the surface andbreaks forth in small springs inmany places. Bro Greer alsothinks that an abundance of water can be saved in a reser-voir  that ^can^ be built in a naturalbasin. I desire this subject consid-ered in connection with myformer letter. The settlements hereneed these meadows for dairiesand milk ranches, but have nomen to pspare to take them upI think, if a company shouldbe sent expressly to occupy theseplaces they would take hold andbe satisfied, and do good. Somecome scattering along, and com-mence rambling around lookingfor places, these cannot be depend-ed upon to do much good.Bro Lake is fast recovering, butBro.

 Kanesville Jany 28th 1850Dear Bro WoodruffYour letter of Decr 6th has just come to hand; and in answer I would say that it is ever pleasing to me to geta letter from you, whither it is short or long.My great objection to many letters is, they are very lengthy upon mattersthat are of no interest to me or themselves. I am ever willing to hear a longletter upon any matter of importance, either to myself or to the writer: but when I get a long string of questions whether the writer belonged to the tribeof Judah or Joseph, and whether he should go to Jerusalem, or to Zion-or whither he could redeem his dead now or hereafter, and a thousandand one things about some old thread bare experience, thirty years ago.These and the like things are what annoy me.With regard to your appointing a presiding Elder over the remains of the Eastern churches before you leave, I would say that you,are acquainted with the conditions of things there better than I am, andyou have unquestionably got your Eye upon some person as the individualto fill that place, should you deem it expedient to appoint a presidingElder. Consult your own Knowledge of things, the circumstances and condition in which men, and things are placed in that country, and actaccording to your own conviction before the Lord, and it will be right.The Keys of the apostleship are with you, and you were sent into thatcountry to take charge, and none are so capable of giving advice to the remaining Saints there, as yourself.The price of wagons suitable for a trip over the mountains, will befrom 50 to 80 dollars—good work cattle will probably be from 50to 80 dollars a yoke (very high because scarce, and in great demand)Wagons may be had here I think, but oxen and cows had better

 OGDEN HERALD: SEMI-WEEKLY.Issued Wednesdays and Saturdays,BY THEOGDEN HERALD PUBLISHING COMPANY.E. H. ANDERSON, - Business Manager.Office in Dooly-Stevens Block, corner ofMain and Fourth Streets.All business communications shouldbe addressed to the Company; thoseintended for publication, to the Editor.Entered at the Post Office at Ogden City,Utah, as Second-class matter.SATURDAY. NOV. 27, 1886.AN EPISTLE.Apostle Woodruff's Cheering Coun-sels to the Saints.To the Saints Scattered Abroad, Greet-ing:DEAR BRETHREN:-I feel desirous to express myself upon the present con-dition of Zion and its inhabitants.The history of which we are making asLatter-day Saints is strictly in fulfil-ment of the revelations of God, as given through the mouths of Prophetsand inspired men to the inhabitants of the earth in every dispensation when God has had an acknowledged people on the earth. The God of heaven, who created this earth andplaced His children upon it, gave unto them a law whereby they might be exalted and saved in a kingdom of glory. For there is a law given unto all kingdoms, and all things aregoverned by law throughout the whole universe. Whatever law any-one keeps he is preserved by that law, and he receives whatever re-ward that law guarantees unto him.It is the will of God that all His chil-dren should obey the highest law,that they may receive the highest glory that is ordained for all immor-tal beings. But God has given all His children an agency to choose what law they will keep.These two principles do exist—good and evil; God and the Devil. Whatever leads to good and to dogood is of God. Whatever leads to evil and to do evil is of the Devil.God has labored from the creation of man to lead him to keep the celestial law, that he may inherit a celestial glory and partake of eternal life, thegreatest of all the gifts of God to man: while the Devil, with all the fallenangels, has labored from the creation to lead man astray, to lead him downto the perdition of ungodly men, that he may have dominion over him.These two principles have governedand controlled the acts of all the chil-dren of men, and laid the foundationfor all the history of the whole worldfor the last six thousand years, or from the creation of man. This power of the Devil, and of all the fallen angels, who are represented to have been one-third part of all thehosts of heaven, who were cast downfrom heaven to earth, has been at war against God and His Christ, and against every Prophet and Apostleand inspired man whom God hasraised up, from the creation of the world to the present day. The first man, Adam, under the influence of the Devil, transgressed a law by which death came into the world.God the Eternal Father gave His onlybegotten Son, as a great sacrifice, to shed His blood to redeem man from death. For as in Adam all die, evenso in Christ shall all be made alive.The God of heaven, whom we wor-ship, is represented as the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. TheFather and Son have tabernacles, and they created man after their ownimage. But the Holy Ghost is aspirit and a witness and a testimony of the Father and the Son. This Holy Ghost and witness are promisedunto all men who will obey the law of the Gospel, which God has re-vealed to the human family. This Holy Ghost rested upon Adam when he blessed in posterity in Adam-ondi-Ahman, three years previous to his death.The Lord gave unto Adam and many of his sons the Holy Priest-hood, whereby they could administer in the ordinances of the Gospel oflife and salvation. The Lord has raised up men in every dispensation, when He has had a people on earthunto whom He has given the Priest-hood, and all people have been blessed when they hearkened to the voice of the Lord. On the otherhand, when the inhabitants of the earth have become wicked, and havetransgressed the law of God, they have been chastised, and when theyhave become ripened in iniquity theyhave been cut off from the earth, as in the case of Noah and Lot, and "as it was in the days of Noah, so shall itbe also in the days of the Son of Man." The righteous were savedwhile the wicked were destroyed.The whole history of the dealings of the Lord with man has shown thebenefits and blessings of obeying theLord and keeping His commandments. The history of the dealings of the Lord with ancient Israel showsthat He blessed the righteous and cursed the wicked and brought His judgements upon them. WheneverIsrael hearkened to the teachings of Moses and the prophets, they pros-pered, and their enemies were a preyunto them. But when they depart-ed from the Lord and set up altars to Baal, and committed sin, the Lord forsook them, as in the case of Judahand Jerusalem, in the days of Zede-kiah the King. He forsook the Lord,and led the people astray. They were full of blood and murder and whoredom and all manner of abomi-nations, and the Lord warned them through His Prophets, Isaiah, Jere-miah and Ezekiel. These Prophets told the king and the people whatjudgments would come upon them, and the Lord said by Ezekiel unto the king and the people, "What I have spoken shall be done." Now all that these Prophets said came topass. Not one jot nor tittle fell un-fulfilled. The Jews put to death theSavior and the Apostles and rejected the Lord and the Gospel; and all thatMoses, Jesus, the Apostles and the Prophets spoke concerning Israel, Judah and Jerusalem, came to pass to the very letter.All the Prophets and Apostles who have written since man was placed upon the earth have seen our day, and have prophesied of the events which were to take place on the earthin the last dispensation and fullness of times. They have seen the Churchof God, the Zion of God, and the Kingdom of God established on the earth, and the gathering of the peo-ple from all nations to build them up, and the judgments of God which were to rest, in the last days, uponall nations who should fight againstMount Zion and the people of God.Now, I wish to ask the Latter-day Saints if they can for a moment thinkthat the Lord will fail in these daysin fulfilling His promises any morethan He has in other dispensations? No; He will not.In fulfillment of his sayings throughthe mouths of those ancient Apostles and Prophets, the Lord has set Hishand once more, for the last time, toprune His vineyard and to establishHis Church and Kingdom upon theearth, to be thrown down no moreforever. He has raised up His Pro-phets and Apostles and revealed unto them the fulness of the everlasting priesthoods of Aaron and of Melchisedek. Joseph Smith was raised up by the power of God, and the administration of angels, and he brought forth the Book of Mormon, the record and stick of Joseph in thehands of Ephraim, as spoken of by the Prophet Ezekiel in the 37th chap-ter. This Prophet of God, JosephSmith, had power to organize theChurch of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, according to the ancient or-der of the Church of Christ, with Apostles and Prophets, Evangelists, Bishops, Pastors and Teachers. And the Church has been led continually by living oracles and the revelations of God from Heaven until the presentday. It has now stood fifty-six years since its organization, and its historyis before the heavens and the earth.The Prophets and Apostles and many Elders have gone forth and preachedthe Gospel of Jesus Christ to many nations, and tens of thousands of the inhabitants of the earth have em-braced the Gospel, been baptized forthe remission of their sins, have re-ceived the Holy Ghost by the layingon of hands, and have been gatheredhome to Zion from many nations, infulfillment of the ancient Prophets, who spoke as they were moved upon by the Holy Ghost. Earth and hell have been combined to stop the little stone from rolling, and from becom-ing a mountain and filling the wholeearth, as Daniel said it should in thelast days. Joseph Smith, his brother Hyrum, with several of the Apostles and Elders and many Saints, have already sealed their testimony withthir blood, and to-day prisons arecrowded with the Elders of Israel forkeeping the commandments of God,and many others have been driven into exile for the same cause.Many of the inhabitants of the landare stirred up and are desirous to de-stroy the Church and Kingdom of God from off the earth. But they know not the thoughts of the Lord,neither understand they His ways. The Gentile or Christian world to-daycan no more commit sins, and be guilty of lying, stealing, blasphemy,whoredoms, or murder, or commit any abominations, and escape the wrath of God, than could Sodom and Gomorrah, or the antediluvian world, or ancient Israel. The word of the Lord has been proclaimed against theGentiles and all the inhabitants of the earth in the last days who com-mit sin, and it will as assuredly befulfilled as in ancient days. The Lordhas a controversy with this genera-tion, and He will judge the inhabi-tants according to the deeds done in the body, and none can stay His hand.I want to say to the Saints of Godwho dwell in the flesh to-day, that the 56 years which have passed awaysince the organization of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,have taken into the spirit world all our Prophets, Apostles, Elders andSaints, who have finished their testi-mony in the flesh. Their voice ishushed in death and their testimony is closed. They are mingling with the spirits of the righteous and wait-ing for the great day of the comingof the Son of Man, when Jesus Christwill come in the clouds of heaven to reward every man according to the deeds done in the body. But thoughthey have passed away, is the work of God finished on the earth? Verilyno. Has the warning voice ceased tobe heard by the inhabitants of the earth? It has not. All of us whoremain in the flesh are under as muchobligation to lift the warning voice and reap while the day lasts as were those who have passed away.The Lord said to Ezekiel, "I have made thee a watchman unto the House of Israel." "When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from hiswicked way, to save his life; the samewicked man shall die in his iniquity;but his blood will I require at thine hand. Yet if thou warn the wicked,and he turn not from his wickedness,nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast de-livered thy soul." This is preciselyour condition to-day. As Apostles, Seventies, High Priests, and Elders, we and all men who bear any portionof the Holy Priesthood, are watch-men upon the walls of Zion and mes-sengers to all the inhabitants of the earth, and all of us will be held re-sponsible if we donot improve ourtime and lift the warning voice, as far aswe have opportunity, and warn this generation of the judgments of God which await them.I know the judgments of God are very nigh unto the door of this na-tion and this generation, and they will overtake the world before it isprepared for that time. Even the coming of the Son of Man is nigh,and he will come as a thief in thenight. Who is prepared to abide the day of His coming? It is our duty to labor and reap. Then everyman should be diligent in that spherein which he is called to act, that his garments may be clean from the blood of all men.I do not believe there was ever a generation of men who inhabited the earth who were more wicked, or who were practising greater abominations, or who were sinning against greater light and knowledge, or who had a greater flood of judgments proclaimed against them by the word of theLord, than the generation in which we live.Therefore, as Saints of the living God, who bear the Holy Priesthood, we shallbe under condemnation if we do not lift up the warning voice against theevils and abominations which ex-ist, so far as we have opportunity. How many woes the Prophets and Apostles have proclaimed against those who fight against Zion. "Woe unto all those who discomfort my people, and drive and murder them,and testify against them, saith theLord of hosts. A generation of vipersshall not escape the damnation of hell. Behold, mine eyes see and know all their works, and I have inreserve a swift judgment, in the sea-son thereof, for them all. For there is a time appointed for every man,according at his work shall be."I will say to the Apostles, our re-sponsibility is very great. The Prophets who organized the Churchand laid the foundation of this lastdispensation, with a whole quorumof Apostles, have finished their testi-mony had gone into the spirit world.We have been called to take their places. What manner of men ought we to be? The whole earth is ripen-ing in iniquity, and the Zion of Godshould be prepared for the coming ofthe bridegroom. We should humbleourselves before the Lord and be in aposition to be filled with the spirit ofour calling, with the Holy Ghost, andwith the revelations of Jesus Christ, that we may know the mind and will of God concerning us, and be pre-pared to magnify our calling and bring to pass righteousness, and bevaliant in the testimony of JesusChrist to the end of our pilgrimage,here in the flesh. The Prophets, Apostles, and all the heavenly hostsare watching over us. There never was a time when the work of God re-quired a more faithful testimony andlabor from the Apostles and Eldersthan to-day.I would say to the Saints, whostand connected with the quorum ofthe Twelves Apostles, as messengers to the nations of the earth, it has fal,en to your lot to go forth and assist to prune the vineyard once more, and for the last time, beforethe coming of the Son of Man. TheLord said, fifty seven years ago, that the field was white for the harvest, and He had set His hand to prune the vineyard once more, and for thelast time. The Elders were com-manded at that day to thrust in theirsickle and reap while it was calledto-day, for soon night would come, when no man could reap. Brethren,it is much nearer night now than it was fifty seven years ago. The Saviorsaid at that day, that the angels were crying day and night forthe privilege to go forth and reap down the earth. He informed them theymust wait a little season untilthe harvest was fully ripe. The na-tions must be warned, Zion must be established, and the wheat, or the Saints, be gathered into the garner, then the angels might go forth andreap the tares, gather them in bun-bles and prepare them for the burn-ing.Since that day many thousands of the Saints have been gathered to Zion from the nations of the earth. But you are called upon at this lateday to still go forth and warn the Gentiles with the proclamation ofthe Gospel. Therefore, brethren, you who are called to go into the vineyard, whether Apostles, HighPriests, Seventies, or Elders, do not be weary in well doing. Remember,you are messengers of salvation.Keep yourselves pure and spotlessbefore God and all men. Seek to bring to pass righteousness, and savethe souls of men. Labor faithfullythat your garments may be clean from the blood of all men, and thatthe nations may be left without ex-cuse in the day of God's judgmentsupon the wicked, which is nigh athand, and those judgments will bepoured out without measure.All the messengers in the vineyard should be righteous and holy men,and call upon the Lord in mighty prayer, in order to prevail. It is the privilege of every Elder in Israel, who is laboring in the vineyard, ifhe will live up to his privileges, tohave dreams, visions, and revelations,and the Holy Ghost as a constant companion, that he may be able tho-roughly to gather out the blood of Israel and the meek of the earth andbring them into the fold of Christ.It is true that the Elders who are called to bear record of the Gospel of Christ to the nations of the earth are many times called to pass through prosecutions for the Gospel's sake, and in some instances to lay down their lives, as did the ancient Saints,and quite a number in our day, for Christ's sake. But there seems to bea special crown of glory laid up forevery man who is martyred for Christ'ssake and the Gospel's. No matter in what age of the world helays down his life for Christ's, he willfind it again, and eternal life in the world to come. Therefore, brethren, let us be diligent in our labors in this last hour in the vineyard. The Lordsaid to Oliver Cowdery, if he labored all the days of his life and saved but one soul, how great would be his joy in the Kingdom of Heaven with that one soul. We have everything to en-courage us in our labors in the vine-yard of the Lord.While this labor is going on amongthe nations of the earth, there is agreat labor and responsibility restingupon the whole ministry who dwellin Zion. There is labor sufficient forevery man who bears any portion of the Holy Priesthood in the variouscapacities in which the brethren are called to act. The High Priests,whose calling is to preside, are calledupon to officiate in Zion as High Councilors, Presidents of Stakes andCounselors, Bishops and Counselors,Superintendents of Sabbath Schools and mutual improvement associa-tions. In every capacity in which they are called to act, they have animmense field in which to improvetheir talents and magnify their call-ings. Here is where the High Priests are mainly called to preside, officiateand labor.There never was a time when theHoly Priesthood, in all its various branches, offices and labors, had agreater work to perform than in our day. The searching out of iniquity, the purifying, sanctifying and cleans-ing of the people, the uniting of theSaints and the general perfecting ofZion resting upon the brethren and the Holy Priesthood who dwell in Zion.The whole Church, both priest andpeople, should give diligent heed tothe late Epistle of the First Presiden-cy, which has been published to the world. The counsel they have given upon the various items they have re-ferred to should be strictly carried out. The breaking of the Sabbath day and pleasure excursions uponthat day should not be indulged in by the Latter-day Saints. The Pres-idents of Stakes and their counselors,the Bishops and their counselors,whose immediate duty it is to watchover the stakes and wards, have agreat responsibility and duty to per-form. Iniquity must be sought out. Zion cannot prosper when sin and in-iquity are permitted to dwell in her midst.One of the most important and re-sponsible fields of labor in Zion isthat committed to the care of thosewho preside over and teach in the primaries, Sabbath schools, and im-provement associations, and thosewho are teaching private day schoolsamong the Latter-day Saints. Whocan comprehend the result of the la-bor performed by the Elders of Israel in these branches? No man, unlessfilled with the revelations of Heavenand the inspiration of Almighty God. We send out hundreds of Elders, whogo to the nations of the earth to preach the Gospel of Christ. After spending two of three years as mis-sionaries, if they have converted adozen souls and brought them into the Church, they think they havedone a good work, which they cer-tainly have. But here, the Elders who are presiding over and teachingin these institutions in Zion, filledwith the children of the Saints, havean army of immortal souls before them to guide and teach, and to di-rect their minds, that they may be qualified to step forth and takehold of the Church and kingdom of God and build it up and bear it off triumphantly, after their fathers and elders are laid in the tomb. O what amission is given to the sons of Eph-raim, the Elders of Israel, the Latter-day Saints! To warn the whole world ofthe judgments which are to come,preach the Gospel to all people, gath-er the saints from all nations, build up Zion, and prepare for the coming of the Son of Man, standing in holy places, while judgments waste the wicked.There is one admonition of ourSavior that all the Saints of Godshould observe, but which, I fear, we do not as we should, and that is, to pray always and faint not. I fear, asa people, we do not pray enough, in faith. We should call upon the Lordin mighty prayer, and make all our wants known unto Him. For if He does not protect and deliver us and save us, no other power will. There-fore our trust is entirely in Him. Therefore our prayers should ascendinto the ears of our heavenly Fatherday and night.I want to say a few words to ourbrethren who are in prison, or underbonds, or driven into exile for our religion, or for keeping the command-ments of God. You should not think that any strange thing has happened unto you. Persecution is a legacy that has been handed down fromfather Adam to our day. It was saidof old that all men who lived godly in Christ Jesus should suffer perse-cution. If we meet with no persecu-tion in our day, we shall hardly feel at home when we go into the spirit world and meet with the ancient prophets and with Christ and theApostles, who passed through much persecution and tribulation. Many of them were crucified or otherwiseput to death. They sealed their tes-timony with their own blood, as was the case with Joseph and Hyrum andseveral of the Apostles, Elders, andSaints in our day.As Elders of Israel, while we arepassing through these afflictions, let us not cherish revenge or hatred in our hearts towards our persecutors."Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord." Jesus Christ, theSon of God, when nailed to the cross,and while in the agony of death, cried, "Father, forgive them; for they knownot what they do." Why didHe say this to His Father in Heaven?Because the Son of God knew full well what would be the result ofHis death upon the heads of His mur-derers. He knew what awaited thewhole Jewish nation, when that peo-ple said, "Let His blood be on us and on our children." He fully com-prehended the great suffering that awaited the Jews and their posterity for the next eighteen hundred years.He knew that all that Moses and theProphets, as well as what He hadspoken Himself, against the Jewishnation, would come to pass; for God had spoken it through them, and his words never fail.No infidel on earth can deny the fact that Jerusalem was overthrown,the foundation of the Temple dug up and not one stone left upon another.The Jews fell by famine, by pestilenceand by the sword, until twelve hun-dred thousand dead bodies were car-ried through the gates outside of the walls of Jerusalem during the dis-tress of the siege under Titus, and a remnant was taken captive and scat-tered throughout the world among the Gentile nations, and the Jewshave been a hiss and a byword, andhave been trampled under the feetof the Gentiles until the present day,and the end is not yet, the yoke isnot yet broken from off their necks.All this has come to pass in fulfil-ment of the Word of God to the Jewish nation. So I say to all mybrethren who are in exile, or inprison, for the Gospel's sake, or forkeeping the commandments of God,do not harbor any vengeance of ha-tred against this nation, or against those who have aided or abetted inyour sufferings, but rather go beforethe Lord and pray that He will sof-ten the hearts of the rulers of the na-tion, that they will give unto the Latter day Saints the same rights and privileges in the worshiping of God according to the dictates of their ownconsciences as are guaranteed by the Constitution of our Government, which was given by the inspirationof the God of heaven for a wise pur-pose in Himself.If I am asked why I make this re-quest of my brethren, I answer, for the same reason that Jesus said, "Father, forgive them; for they knownot what they do." For as the God of heaven fulfilled all His wordswhich He spoke concerning Judeaand Jerusalem, so will He fulfill all that He has spoken concerning the Gentiles and all the nations of theearth in the last days.I will here say, as truly as the God of heaven lives, and has established His throne on high, just so truly will He bring to pass the fulfilment of His words. He will pour out that flood of judgments upon our nationand upon all the nations of the earth,which has been proclaimed by every inspired man since the world began.The seals will be opened, the plaguespoured out, and Great Babylon willfall. This generation has been warn-ed for the last fifty years by inspired and righteous men, and after theirtestimony will come the testimony of thundering, of lightning, of floods, of earthquakes, and of pestilence, and famine, and war, and the flamesof devouring fire, for by fire and bysword will the Lord plead with all flesh and the slain of the Lord will be many. For the Lord has said, "My sword is bathed in heaven, andit shall fall upon Idumea, or the world: and who is able to stand?"No power on earth can stay the hand of God in this work. The God of heaven will teach this nation andall other nations on earth, that He isstronger than man. He pays no re-gard to nations or numbers, in thefulfillment of his purposes, for Heholds in His hand the destiny of all men and nations, and no power be-neath the heavens can hinder Hiswork. The God of Israel has set his hand to gather His people from all nations and build up His Church andestablish Zion in all that beauty, power, and glory which Isaiah and other Prophets saw, and to build upHis kingdom, which shall fill the whole earth, and in which Jesus of Nazareth will establish his throne and sit thereon, and reign over theearth for one thousand years, as theProphet David and other Prophets have declared. And it will come to pass in spite of earth and hell and all the unbelief of the whole Christian Gentile world. If our nation or theGentiles do not believe this, let them wait and see, and they will not haveto wait long before they will seethe signs manifest of the beginning ofthese things. So far as the Saints are concerned, the Spirit of God will bear record to their spirits as they read these testimonies, of their truth.I will close by quoting the testi-mony of Ezekiel in the 24th chapter14th verse— "I the Lord have spokenit; it shall come to pass, and I will doit; I will not go back, neither will I repent; according to thy ways, andaccording to thy doings, shall they judge thee, saith the Lord God."WILFORD WOODRUFF.October, 26, 1886

 PREST. WOODRUFF'S ADDRESS.President Wilford Woodruff was thefirst speaker. He spoke as follows:I want to say to the Latter-day Saints that I have had quite a desire of late to once more address you uponsome few subjects which I have upon my mind. I have been for quite a timeunder the weather as the saying is.I have not been able to meet with theSaints nor to do any business a gooddeal of the time. But I have been blessed of late with a little betterhealth.The first subject I want to name is the addressing of the Latter-day Saints in this Tabernacle or in anyother assembly. There is nothing more painful to me than to arise before fiveor ten thousand people and attempt toaddress them when not one in five, orten, or twenty, can hear what I say.It is very difficult when this Taber-nacle is full for any man to makethem hear. In speaking in this Tabernacle there area few rules which I think every manshould observe. In the first placehe ought to preach to that post right in the center yonder from the time he begins till the time he gets through.When a man who speaks from this stand turns to the right, nobody on theleft can hear him, and whenhe turns to the left, no-body on the right can hear him,and for men and women to sit here hour after hour without hearing or un-derstanding what is said, is very pain-ful. Pardon me, brethren and sisters, for referring to this. I perhaps am likethe rest of my brethren. I do not know that I can make this assembly hear, but I will do the best I can.I was blessed with the privilege of attending the celebration of the intro-duction of the Pioneers into these val-leys of the mountains. I wasvery poor in health, but I was enabled almost every dayto attend those assemblies, andon the Pioneer day I had the privilegeof riding at the head of the Pioneercompany with several of my brethren. The events which I was privileged to witness during the Jubilee week were of deep interest to me andbrought to my mind a great many thoughts and reflections. I had theprivilege of meeting in this Tabernaclesome ten or fifteen thousand boys and girls of the rising generation in themidst of Israel. Among other things I had the honor of being crowned hereby a young lady as the oldest Pioneerof the valley. I looked upon it as afar higher honor than being crowneda king or a prince. All that I saw andheard during those celebrations fur-nished a testimony to me, and laid with weight upon my mind the eventsof the past. I viewed the adorning and the lighting of this city in the evenings with great delight. I havetraveled something like 175,000 miles inover sixty years of my pilgrimage, andI never saw in any part of the world anything to compare with it. It is true the nations of the earth in yearsgone by have not had those appliancesthat we have today in so great a measure.I want to refer to the contrast between the celebration of the en-trance of the Pioneers into this val-ley, and the entrance of the Pioneers itself. This celebration brought strongly to my mind what God has wrought in these valleys of the moun-tains. My thoughts turn to the day when we entered this valley, when Idrove President Young in my carriage,he lying upon a bed of sickness. Wecamped here on the east of the Knuts-ford. We spent one night there. Presi-dent Young slept in his bed in my wagon one night after entering thisbarren desert, and he was quite asick man. He said to me in the morn-ing. "Brother Woodruff, I want totake a walk." "All right," said I. A number of the Twelve Apostleswere there and they got together. Hecommenced to walk from our encamp-ment across this barren desert, thissage plain without any guide to markanything appertaining to the future ofthe children of men in this land. Presi-dent Young was quite feeble. He wore his little green cloak upon hisshoulders and he walked slowly along.As we advanced from below on to therising ground we came to a certain spot where he stopped very suddenly.He took his cane, which had a spikein the end of it, and stuck it down intothe ground, and said, "Here shall standthe Temple of our God." It wentthrough me like lightning. I did notinsult him, the Prophet of God, by ask-ing him who told him so. What was there here to encourage the Prophetof God to make a remark of that kind?What had he to trust to build aTemple here that would cost four mil-lions of dollars? Instead of havingaround him a hundred thousand work-ing men with millions of money inhand, he had one hundred and forty men. We were sore and tired and weary, without any money in ourpockets, and still the Prophet of Godsticks his cane into the ground andsays, "Here shall stand the Temple ofour God." I asked him to stop theretill I could break a piece of sage brushor something that I could drive down into the place. I did nothing else un-til I put a stake in that spot that hemarked with his cane, and then we went on about our business. But whenI listened to his words that first nightthat we spent in this barren desert, andthen he told us here was going to stand the Temple of our God, I knew that man spoke by the Spirit of Al-mighty God. I knew it from the Spir-it that was resting upon me. I was satisfied it would all be fulfilled.What has been the result? Beforeyou, he lived here. He laid the foun-dation of that Temple, and there stood the stake in the middle of that Temple when it was laid out, withoutany regard to his prophecies or say-ings. These things rested with great weight upon my mind as I looked up-on the mighty throngs celebratingthe event of the Pioneers into the val-leys of the mountains. There standsthat Temple today, with its spires, on top of one of which a statue of Moronistands, blowing the Gospel trump pointing to the throne of God inheaven, in fulfillment of the prophe-cies of Patriarchs and Prophets thou-sands of years ago. Those are eter-nal truths that ought to rest withsome weight upon the minds of theLatter-day Saints.Half an hour after the event I havedescribed, I heard President Young say to Samuel Brannan, who wasurging him to leave this desert landand go to California, "No, I am goingto stop right here; I am going to builda city here; I am going to build a Tem-ple here; and I am going to build a country here." Where is the fulfill-ment of this? It is before the eyes ofall the world today. This prophecyhas been fulfilled to the very letter.President Young lived to dedicatethe corner stone of this Temple, and to fulfil all that he had promised. Henot only built this Temple, but he dictated and directed the building ofthe St. George Temple at a cost ofhalf a million dollars. I dedicated thelower part of that house in its first dedication, by commandment of theProphet of the Lord. Brother Erastus Snow and Brother Brigham Young Jr.dedicated the other portion of it. Thousands upon thousands of the liv-ing and the dead have been blessed inthat Temple from that day until thepresent. These are principles of in-terest to me, whether they are to any-body else or not. The Prophet of God also laid out the Manti Temple, andhe did a thing that perhaps no otherman on the earth would have done—he removed a mountain at the cost ofa hundred thousand dollars toget a place that would suit him forthat Temple to stand on. That Tem-ple was built under his direction, and Brother Folsom superintended its con-struction. Not only that Temple butalso the Temple in Logan was builtby his voice and counsel so long as helived.These things are before the heavens and before the earth, and the Saints ought not to forget the blesings which God has bestowed through His Proph-ets who have been among us. TheLord has set His hand to carry outthis great work. Here we havestanding in the State of Utah fourTemples, in which the Elders of Israel are laboring to redeem their dead andthe dead of their fellow men. These things lie with weight upon my mind.They did during this great celebration.To see the thousands upon thousands come here into these valleys of the mountains fifty years after our arrival,it made me feel as though all the Latter-day Saints ought to have faithin God in His promises and revelations.For if there is anything that hastaken place unlooked for to the wholeearth it has been the building up of these Rocky Mountains by the Lat-ter-day Saints, through the power ofGod. But we have performed a workso far and that, too, under the dictationand direction of the Prophets of God that have been sent among us. I

 think that we as Latter-day Saints ought to understand our posi-tion before the Lord and everyman that has got the Priesthood, everyman that has entered into covenants with the Lord should never turn histhoughts, his affections or his work inany other channel than the building up of the kingdom of God. If we do we will miss it in the end, when we pass to the other side of the vail.We have everything to encourage us in the carrying out of the purposes of the Lord in our labors. It has been a very remarkable period that we have passed through during the cele-bration of the entrance of the Pioneersinto the valley and of that which hastaken place since we came here. I amthankful myself to God that I havelived to see the fulfillment of these promises of the Prophet of God. Theyare great testimonies to me that theLord means what He says and sayswhat He means.There is another principle I have up-on my mind that I would like to speak of. The Prophet Joseph Smith taught the Twelve Apostles in my day and time with re-gard to the principle of revela-tion. The Prophet said theElders of Israel would havetheir minds moved upon by the Spirit of God concerning variousthings which they might not alwaysunderstand, but if they would followout that principle and practice upon itit would very soon become a principleof revelation to them. This is a true principle and by observing it I havebeen blessed all my life. Almost everymission I have ever had in this Churchhas been by the inspiration of Al-mighty God to me. I have been ledto do this, that and the other, andwhenever I have done it I have foundthe truth of God made manifest con-cerning it. I am here today a livingman. Without heeding that principleI would have been in the spirit worlda great many years ago. We allshould seek and labor for this prin-ciple of revelation and get the mind and will of God. It is very easy to dothat, if we do our duty before the Lord.I desire to refer to myself a little in carrying out those principles whichhave been given me by the Prophet ofGod. In the time of the great apos-tasy at Kirtland, when there were so many enemies that held the Apostle-ship and various offices in the Priest-hood who were at war against the Prophet of God, I was there up to acertain time. Right in the midst ofthat apostasy the Spirit of God cameto me and told me to choose a partnerand go to Fox Islands. I knew nomore what was on Fox Islands than Idid what was on Kolob, but the Lord said go to Fox Islands, and I selecteda partner and went. My partner wasJonathan H. Hale. I went through Farmington, Connecticut, my father's abiding place, and preached there onenight. I baptized my father, my step-mother, my half-sister, and several ofmy relatives, and organized a smallbranch of the Church. I then went on my way to the Islands. When I got to the Islands I learned what theLord had sent me there for. I founda people that were searching for lightand truth. Without dwelling uponthis, I will say I had the privilege, withmy companion, of baptizing every man and woman belonging to a Bap-tist church there. Of course this arouseda warfare against us. A Methodist minister came from the South Islandsand made war against us, and I bap-tized most of the members of his church in a little while.I took a large company of them with me up to Zion after I received word from the Prophet thatI was called of God by revelation tofill the place of one of the Twelve. Now, nobody told me to go to FoxIslands except the Lord. I asked some counsel about it and went and fulfilledwhat the Lord required at my hands.It was upon the principle of revela-tion. It was the same when the Twelve Apostles went to England. They went by revelation and com-mandment of God. Brother John Tay-lor and myself were the two first ofthe quorum to land in England. Brother Taylor went to Liverpool, andI went to Staffordshire. I there foundBrother Cordon with whom I stopped and labored. We preached everynight in the week, and baptized quitea number, and I thought we were do-ing an excellent work. I went onenight into the town hall of Hanleyto preach to the people. Before I got up to speak, the Holy Spiritcame to me and told me, "This is thelast meeting you will hold with thispeople for many days." I did notknow what the Lord wanted of me.We did our preaching, and we baptized quite a number after the meeting. TheSaints asked me where I was going. I told them I didn't know. I went andasked the Lord what I should do andwhere I should go. "Go to the south,"was all the answer I got from theLord. I got into the stage and rodeeighty miles south, and the first man'shouse I stopped at was John Ben-bow's. When I got there I found a large number of people, who had broken off from the Wesleyan Method-ists and other churches and who had taken the name of United Brethren, praying the Lord to open some doorwhereby they could be enlightened inthe things of God and anxiously wait-ing for the ancient order of things tobe res[t]ored as you and I have been inour day. I hadn't been in his housefifteen minutes until I understoodwhy the Lord had sent me. The firstthirty days I brought all that body ofpeople and many others into the Church. I baptized them and their ministers, too. I had in my hands all their chapels, licensed according to law. We brought into the Church over two thousand in eight months, andformed two or three conferences, and many of them are now in Utah, some of them Bishops in the Church.I do not name this because I want to take any honor to myself, but when the Spirit of God tells a man to do anything he ought to do it, and then the blessings of God will be with him.It has been so with me in my labors. I have endeavored to do what the Lord has told me. I want our Elders,our young men that are going on mis-sions, to learn this principle while they are young. Learn to get the spirit ofrevelation. You know what is right and what is wrong, and the Spirit ofGod will educate our young men in these principles and they will becomemighty men in the hands of God if they will but carry this out. This is aprinciple that I feel we ought toteach and practice. We should studyconstantly to know what the mindand will of God is concerning us, andwhen we do that there will be no di-vision among us, but we shall all be of one heart and one mind.Brethren and sisters, I do not feelthat I ought to talk any longer to you this afternoon, but I thank God that I have this privilege of meeting with youonce more in the flesh. There are manythings I do not understand, and one iswhy I am here at my present age. I do not understand why I have beenpreserved as long as I have been whenso many Apostles and Prophets have been called home. I want to bear my testimony upon another subject. I amthe only man living in the flesh that received endowments under the handsof the Prophet Joseph Smith. I am the only man in the flesh that was with the Twelve Apostles when he turned over the kingdom of God tothem and laid upon them the com-mandment to bear off this kingdom. He stood for some three hours in a room delivering to us his last lec-ture. The room was filled as with consuming fire. His face was as clearas amber; his words were like vividlightning to us. They penetrated every part of our bodies from the crown of our head to the soles of our feet. He said, "Brethren, the Lord Almighty has sealed upon my head every Priest-hood, every key, every power, every principle that belongs to the last dis-pensation of the fulness of times, andto the building up of the kingdom of God. I have sealed upon your heads allthose principles, Priesthood, apostle-ship, and keys of the kingdom of God,and now you have got to round up your shoulders and bear off this king-dom or you will be damned." I do not forget those words—I never shallwhile I live. That was the last speech he ever made in the flesh. Soon after-ward he was martyred and calledhome to glory.I have always felt to bear my testi-mony to the Church and to the worldconcerning the truths of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. My prayer to God is that we may pursue a course whereinwe may be justified at the end of our work. Our brethren that laid thefoundation of this Church and king-dom are upon the other side of the vail. I have no doubt myself but theyare watching with interest everythingthat takes place with us here, though to what extent is not revealed to us. I desire, therefore, that we may all live in that way and manner that wemay be justified and saved in the king-dom of our God.The Lord has set His hand to build Zion. He is not going to fail. It mat-ters not who opposes it, or what views and feelings of unbelief the children ofmen may have with regard to the pur-poses of the Lord, these purposes will all come to pass. Zion will arise and flourish. The glory of God will rest upon her, and she will accomplish all that Isaiah and the other Prophetshave spoken concerning her.God bless you all, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.

Salt Lake CityDear Brother!I feel it my duty to adress you these few lines,as it appears, there is something in the way, whichprevents me, from enjoying the preveleges, and blessingsof the Gospel; and I am at a loss to learn what it is.My reason for the above is as follows. Abouth a yearago the seventies quorum of which I am a memberwas called to furnish four missionaires for differentcontries including the Netherlands.The presidenci of my quorum consulted with me andaccepted me and forwarded my name to Salt Lake asbeing fully competent as a missionaire for the Netherlands and as in goed standing in my quorum. I belivebishop Stratford of whose ward I am a member, andalsoo the presidt of the stake bro L. W. Shurtliffendorsed my name. All of the four names forwar-ded to Salt Lake as missionaires at that timehave been accepted and are now on missions exceptmine; and I have wonderd ever since what couldbe the cause of my rejection. Dear brother as far as I am aware of my former mission has been approved of the Lord and blessed with fruits upon myn labors. Ever since I have y[i]elded obedienceto the principels of the gospel and made covenantswith my Heavenly Father. I have tried to domyn duties in the church laboring in every capacity
