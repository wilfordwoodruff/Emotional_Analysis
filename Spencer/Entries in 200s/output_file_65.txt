I had come to the conclusion that they had become so far advanced in the order of the kingdom and become so popular in temperal things that they had entirely forgotten that such an uncouth old plough goger goer as Lyman Wight had an existance on the face of the earth, but I yet live and am bold to say that of the doctrine of Joseph Smith the Angel  of the seventh dispensation there is not a firmer believer ^or defender^ on the face of the earth and hold every ordination given me as sacred as I did the day they ware given, and if the death of Br Joseph gave one of the twelve a supremacy ^over^ the others I have it yet to learn, did Brigham Young have any authority at Joseph death more than he received from Br Joseph If you answer no I ask whence did he receive aurtohority to disanul revela- toions given by Br Joseph? See Book of Doctrine and Covenants p 396 par 7th  concerning building the Nauvoo house and by carful examination you will find that I have a revoelation given to me which is not to end while  I live on the earth, and no man on the earth has a right to take that mission from me being ^given^ of God the highest of all, yet I did consider it my duty to counsel with the twelve, and the fifties had not circumstances ordered it otherwise the mission I am now on Br Willford I received of the  prophet of God, and it was well known by the twelve at that time that Joseph was striving very hard to come to this very place with 250,000 men he therefore requested me to come and establish a church in this region and such a mission was even talked of while in jail where I had the  advantage of six months teaching and received many things that is yet unknown to the church, never having refiused to obey the prophet I starteded in all good ENDENTRY A true Christian, so pure in heart, a little  Sun beam in any home, a perfect, house keeper, all kinds of sewing, clean very neat.

I acknowlege I am afraid of tobacco but should have no fear of the person for I believe he was to lazy to have chased me all over Nauvoo, he pitched into me largely on many occations but I care very little about the whole. I did not so much wonder at this having been with him for four weeks after the death of Br Joseph and I do not recolect of hearing him use the pronoun we when speaking of the twelve for the first time but got the pronoun I so comploetely to perpection that I consider^e^d myself out all together. I soon learnt that I was cut off from the church but never learnt what it was for, after learning this I found I had no where to go but to my beloved Br Joseph and to the Saviour with the former I have had many com- munications face to face without a dimning vail between, and received many good instructions this has been to me fully satisfactory, and as I am a little timid about meeting men ^with^ such dangerous we^a^pons I have kept one steady course doing what I considered my duty according to my ordinations. I will now proceed to answer your questions according to the best of my recolection, as to Military or civil offices I could have had as much as I pleased when I was young if I had aspired after it therefore I never went higher than corporal, sergent, Cap, and so on, after the county Coldwell was set off I consented to run for Col, of which I received a unanimous voice, at Nauvoo I receeved 2 commissions one of Brig. Gen, and one of Brevt, Maj. Gen. I have held the office of Chief Justice since I have been in Glaspie County where the other inhabitants ware duble that of  the mormons this comprises about all the civil offices of my life.  As to church offices I have nentioned two in my journal first an Elder and then a high preaiest. In Jackson Co while the mob was raging tareir down chimbles, tairing open the store there was much said concerning who should go up to Independence and put a stop to the unholy work, and it was agreed that I should take the lead and go up.

This makes  a summary of my ordinations, and the revelation that I should continue to preach for Zion till the Lord should take me to himself. I only ask that I may have  the priveiledge of fulfiling them honerably so that I can give an honerable account to my Saviour and Br Joseph in a coming day. I say had the twelve stood in  there place I would have been glad to have cooperated with them but immediately after receiving those insults from the stand I received a letter from the eleven teling me to mind my own business and they would mind theirs, which gave me to understand there was now an entire seperation  And to show you that I have been obedient to this command. If you  should requst any further corespondence I will then commence at the  date of that letter and give my journal down to the pre^s^ant date.

And as to my ^belief^ in Mormonism I have never wavered one hair, but have grown with its grown with its growth and still preach it with unabated force, and as for my moral character I am read to put it beside those who feel so much beyound me, and as for the company with me I am willing to have them catechised upon Mormonism by your most experenced or adapt critics, and I verily believe they would ^be^ great service to you in this critical hour.

When the enemy was prowling around Jackson Co I was ever called upon to take the lead in quelling insurrections and when Barukale called upon the strength of the Lords house and 200 men turned out I was ordered to take the command of the same and done so. And again when the mob militia infested Far West they sent 35 mile for me in the dead of the night by this means I was thrown into prison for 6 months which mostly came through false sw^e^aring by false Brethren and false letters  writiten by the same after all those insults and slanderous conversation I feel so fired with indignation at a mob let them be where they may, I feel as I did then as if I wanted to have a hand in quelling the cursed spirit of mobocracy.

The other one we have known ^nothing^ of till within the  last half century. I have found quite a number that sprung from that family during my travels and preaching sufficient to know that they sprung from  the one that landed in Virginia, but like those of the other family ware never very numerous till within the last falf century. But to return to the one that  settled in Leister his family consisted of several girls and boys but he was so unfortunate as to raise but one of the males his name also was Levi he lived and died in the same place he raised a family of three boys and two girls the oldest by the name of Uzial died at sea the second by the name of  Caleb went to sea and was never heard of more nor vessel or cargo the third whose name was Levi died in Leister after raising a family of five boys and four girls two of the boys died without families namely Uzial and Abner the other three namely Caleb raised large families Levi was my father he was the first to move ^from^ the township the township  where they first commenced settleing he moved in the month of March 1796 to the state of N Y where I was born I was the seventh child a and the sixth son three brothers unitedly had 26 children and the four girls 46.

There are but ^few^ instances in the early part of my  life that would be interesting, my paretns ware very strenuous believers in the  Universalian doctrine, strictly moral and perfectly honest, and if I have any immorality about me it is not chargable to my parents I was strictly taught  to rise above all degridation and never to aspire to any thing that was above my abilities. There is many instances in my life that will be to tegious to come into this sketch I shall content myself for the preseant by saying that I was kept at  a common Country school till I was old enough to help support a numerous family after this I continued to go to school some winters till I was sixteen which left me with a very limted education but I must ^say^ in honer to my parents that it was not their fault but it was their desire that I should go to school longer, from the time I was old enough I took great interest in attending meetings and many times felt seriously affected, but about the time I left  school I began to feel as many other youngsters do that the pleasures of this  life was about all I should ever get and if I missed of them I should miss a good chance I was light minded fond of company and with all quite fond of music and in order to keep up my end with the family and gratify my feelings and not fall behind in my youthful career I besought my father to let me go and work by the month, accordingly in the month of March after I was sixteen I hired out for six months and worked it out manfully. I now commenced a career a sixteenth part of which would be to much for this communication In the month of Sep 1813, I hired to a man to take his place in the militia and go to Sacketts Harbor not being old enough to go for myself for which I received $30$ a month after being there 14 days I was chosen as one of a guard to escort 236 prisoners to Albany and 200 from Sacketts Harbor where we delivered them in good order and returned as far as Utica and ware honerably dismissed I having served just two months to a day received my money and went home in good health and spirits although but 17 years of age I began ^to^ think myself quite a man.

I here served three months received an honerable discharge and got home with over $100. I now concluded that I was man enough to look out a better country than the one we lived in accordingly in Dec I shouldered my knapsack and traveled westward 170 miles and stoped in Henrietta 6 miles north of Rochester and a prettier or better country I never have seen before or since I was gone from home about one year and the extraordinry circumstances of this year meeted me about $500. I returned and my father and brothers moved to the same place I was now 20 years old and my father gave me my time and I went to work here and there and every where, or wherever I could do the best. In 1819 I went to Mich and back to Henrietta having been gone about one year. In 1823 I marreied a wife named Sarah Bradley moved 60 miles south into the genesee country and after having two children moved to Warrensville Cuyahoga Co Ohio I resided in this place till 1829 about the month of May when I heard Sidney Rigdon preach what was then called the Rigdonite doctrine after hearing him go through the principle of baptism for the remission of sins I went forward and was baptzised by  his hands amidst the scorns and derision of several hundred souls and thus became became a bold and fearless defender of the Rigdonite doctrine I should have said up ^to^ this period of my life I had never imbraced any particu- lar tenit of doctrine; my ^wife^ had been a presbyterian and I frequently attended meetings with her and had my three first children sprinkled but never believeved in  any of the religeious creeds of the day in consequence of their not carrying out the whole doctrine of the Apostles ever believing that it took as much to save  a man in one age of the world as an other.

I in conformity to ^this^ covenant moved the next Feb to Morley we commenced our labors together in great peace and union, we ware soon joined by eight other families our labors ware united both in farming and mechanism all of which was prosecuted with great vigor we truly began to feel as if the Millenium ^was^ close at hand every thing moved smothly on till about the first of Nov about this time 5 families concluded to join us in the town of May- field about seven miles up the river they each owning a good farm and mills it was concluded best to establish a branch there accordingly I was appointed to go and take the charge of the branch when I had my goods about half loaded four men came along namely P. Whitmer; and book of Mormon which they wished to interduce to us. I desired them to hold on till I  got away as my business was of vital importance and I did not wish to be troubled with romances nor idle speculators, but nothing daunted they ware not to be put off, but ware as good natured as you please curiosity got uppermost and I concluded to stop for a short time, we called a  meeting and one testified that he had seen Angels, and an other therat he had seen the plates, and that they had seen miracles rought and that  the gifts was again in the church, the meeting became so interesting  that I did not get away till the sun was about an hour high at night and it was dark before I arrived at my new home and I amused myself by thinking that the trouble was over and that I should not see them again for a long time supposeing they would start the next morning for the western boundary of Missouri but in this I was very much disappointed, but to discribe to you the scenes of the  next seven weeks one sceene of which would be as interesting as an other would fill quite a large volume. I shall therefore content myself by saying that they brought the Book of Mormon to bear upon us and the whole of the common stock family was baptized and dureing the seven weeks they tarried they succeeded in building up a church of 130 members myself and family was baptized by P.

In all this I give you but a afew instances out of hundreds I next come to the commencement of my preaching and labors in the church On the 21st I made an appointment to preach and filled the same with  out any serious difficulty and on the 22nd I was called upon to baptize three persons namely Benjamin, Crandle; thus performing all the rites and ceremonies of the church with but little  further embarrassment, fully believing that I was authorized of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, to administer in all the ordinances of init^i^ation into the church of Jesus Christ, my travels being limited to the borders  of Sandusky river, and the intermediate counties make^ing^ a distance of two hundred miles. ^baptized 373, organised 8 churches, ordained 50 elders, many priests, teacchers, and deacons^ On the 4th of June 1831, a conference was held at Joseph Smih our  modern Prophet presided; and here I again saw the visible manifestations of the power of God as plain as could have been on the day of pentecost, and here for the first time I saw the Melchisidec priesthood introduced into the church of Jesus Christ as anciently; whereunto I was ordained  under the hands of Joseph Smith, and I then ordainded Joseph and  Sidney and sixteen others such as he chose unto the same priesthood.

After two days the conference broke up receiving the revolation which appointed 28 elders their Mission to Missouri which you will find in the John Corrill was appointed to travel together.  All things being now ready I started on the above named mission  on the 14th day of June 1831; and on the 13th of Aug landed at Joshua Lewis's ^Jackson Co^ a member of the church, here I found many of the brethren named in the foregoing revelation this being the first time I had seen them  since I left home. We stoped with a ^small^ branch of the church thad had went up by water and camped in a school house. On the 14th I dlivered a lecture ^to^ the branch on the subject of the geathering comparing their circumstances with the perilous circumstances of the ancient churches.  From the 25th of Aug to the 21st of Oct I continued labouring in the land of Zion with the exception of makeing two journies the Snybar Creek and back makeing 200 miles preach eight times, and also one journey to Clay County 50 miles. The remainder of this time I preached at home twice a week besides my daily labor.  From this time to Jan 26, 1832 I confined myself to hard labor preaching with the church, makeing preparations for my family, and to return to the eastern land according to an other revelation which says "Mine Elders shall return." From this you will disc^o^ver that I filled the mission with due diligence according ^to^ the requarements of the revelation having traveled through the states of Ill, and Missouri being 1200 miles on foot, and having either waded or swam forty seven rivers and creeks and ferried three. In the mean time on the 6th of Sep 1831 my family arrived with a small branch of the church I doubled my exertions which gave me but a small portion of rest either by day or by neight, yet by the memorable 26th of Jan. 1832 I had accomplished  my designs of prepairing a comfortable house with food and raiment sufficient to make my family comfortable for 6 months, and again shouldered my valise to bear the glad tidings of the gospel through the broad spreading prairies of the west and to the scattering inhabitants thereof, even eastward to the city of Cincinnati.

In which time I traveled to Lafayette Co and back 6 times making 400 miles one journey on business for Ray, Fayette counties 120 miles. Baptised 33 persons, and in Co with 3 others broke  and fenced 40 acres of prairie, planted 23 acres. Had the watch care of a branch  of 160 members, in which branch I preached thre times every Sabbath and  once every Thursday with the exception of the two Sabbaths and thre Thursdays.  During these travels and preachings I bought and sold the following named property as an agent of the agent of the church 80 head of cattle for $500. 22000 lb of flour at $2.50 per cwt. ^$550^ 4 hourses $175. Pork 141. Leather $92. Corn $50. Potatoes $75. Store goods $15. Bacon $120. Thus having completed the business and travels of ten months I find on suming up that I had traveled 1080 miles. Baptized 33 persons, preach at least five ^tines^ a week and traded as an agent for the church $1598 and planted a crop by the labor of my own hands sufficient to have supported my family and an othe as large.  From June 6th 1833 to Jan 12th 1834 I was infested with a ruthless mob during the whole of which time I have a minute historical account  during this time I moved my family five miles to the big blue river and opened a new polantation. Met once a week with about 40 or 50 Elders who spoke in different interpreped for two months, having always to be on our lookout for fear the mob would be upon us, and on this account we generally met in the woods in by places. The mob continued to commit depredaitions, and outrages upon us untill the 13th of Nov 1833 such as tariing down the printing office, destroying books, unroofing houses, thrusting rails into the windows, whiping many in a horible manner, and shooting others.

S. L. City,  Septr 5th 1857.  Brother Jackson,  I have to acknowledge receipt of your Letter of blank together with a Packet of Fruit Buds, andc. for which we feel much obliged and thank you for the interest you manifest on our behalf—The Grafts of Roses were mostly dead—the Peaches were dead but the Plums and Pears were in  good order and we have the various kinds growing here except the Duchesse d'Angouleme.  We think will forward you a List of such kinds of Fruit as we would like to obtain, by this or the next Mail and shall be obliged by your rendering such assistance in forwarding same as you may be able. Our experience shews us that grafts forwarded in the Winter or Spring as they can be cut will be preferable.  We have received a great variety of choice fruit from the Eastern States this season so that we have now about a hundred varieties of Apples, Pears, Plums and Cherries.  We shall be glad to receive any choice varieties of Roses, Strawberries, Blackberries, Raspberries and Gooseberries, as to currants we have some superior ^native^ varieties—If you can get a choice running rose we are without such a thing and shall be glad to have it. The Moss Rose which you have twice sent out has been dead each time. ENDENTRY W. H. Guite Dec. 12 1897. ENDENTRY I think this may simply be the back of the previous page? ENDENTRY
