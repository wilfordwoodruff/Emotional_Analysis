I did not so much wonder at this having been with him for four weeks after the death of Br Joseph and I do not recolect of hearing him use the pronoun we when speaking of the twelve for the first time but got the pronoun I so compl all together. I soon learnt that I was cut off from the church but never learnt what it was for, after learning this I found I had no where to go but to my beloved Br Joseph and to the Saviour with the former I have had many com- munications face to face without a dimning vail between, and received many good instructions this has been to me fully satisfactory, and as I am a little timid about meeting men ^with^ such dangerous we^a^pons I have kept one steady course doing what I considered my duty according to my ordinations.
