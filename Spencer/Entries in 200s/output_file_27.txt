Sept. 9th ^1888^    President Wilford Woodruff,    Dear Brother:    I received your letter, concearing  the mission. I am happy to say  that I am on hand to do all  the good I can, by the ^help^ of the Lord  to build up the Kingdom of  God. Which I know I can get  if I remain faithful and  true to him. As you are  giving the privlige, to Nov. 14th  it will suit me better, As I  have a great deal to do, to  get myself ready.    This is all from your  Faithful Servant and Brother  In the gospel, Evan A. Lewis 
 to the house of the Lord; now my dear Wife is  in circumstances to become a mother, and it is  to her and to me very painfull to think that   our first child should be born out of the   covenant.  I submite this to us so great and  important matter to your kind and fatherly con-  sideration, praying that you may decide for us  to go to the Lord's house for the blessings therof.  Before I close, I wish to mention, what I long de-  sired to do, but waited for an opportunity of  personally meeting you, and it is this:    When I first came to Zion I was so much dis-  turbed and exited in my mind, that there may  some misunderstandings have taken place, and in this  shape some things have been represented to you, and  caused you to doubt; but looking now back to  the exitement of the first days after my arrival  in Zion, having been in a constant exitement caused  by the peuple in nearly all the Wards in S. Lake,  I do not wonder that misstatements occured.  I am thankfull today that things are better, and   it is my desire to go on humble before my Lord  in serving Him and keeping His commandments to  the best of my knowledge and understanding.    It is also also my hearts desire to be directed  in my future labors by you, and I place my-  self with all my heart and soul subject to  your counsel and directions as a Prophet of God.

Elder Woodruff  My dear Brother    I received your   kind and welcome letter dated  December 7th 1856 yester day and was  very glad to hear from you altho  we have had most of the same  news that was contained in your  letter some 4 weeks ago.    We were truly much surprised  and greatly shocked to hear of the   death of our beloved brother J. M.  Grant for he surely was one of  Gods Noble men on the Earth  and much beloved by all good  men that knew him and a great  many that did not know him.  He has left an impression on the  minds of the people that never  can be obliterated in this life.

 Historians and apostles yourselves, you will thoroughly  understand the vastness of the subject and record of your  own lives, and the cost to gather and bring all into book form  independent of publishing. But, being anxious to write  the history of Utah in the interest of the Mormon people,  I started with this Northern Volume, designing next a  Southern Volume; and so, with three volumes, magne  brought up to date, magnificently illustrated with $20,000 of  steel plates of the men who founded this Territory, Utah would  have a published history not unworthy to live. No mere  publisher, as a financial venture, could publish 3 such volumes  with a limited circulation: the steel plates alone requiring a  capital of twenty thousand dollars. But I have been backed  with the money and friendship of great generous men; and  the steel plates, like my histories, have been the accumulations  of years. I scarcely need tell you this, as the money of President  Young, have and Geo A. Smith, Wilford Woodruff, Lorenzo  Snow, Geo. Q Cannon, F. D. Richards, Moses Thatcher, Wm  B. Preston and many others of your own class, with Hooper  Jennings, Eldredge, and monied men of the Gentiles have  so greatly helped me in my work.    This work of writing these histories of Utah and the  Mormon people has not been, with Edward Tullidege, a mere  author's effort for fame and bread, nor a publisher's  speculation. It has been regarded by me from the onset—   even before Franklin Richards called me to the Millennial  Star Office thirty three years ago—as the work and mission  of my life, to help to create for the Mormon people a worthy  national literature, of a semi-Hebraic type, corresponding  with the genius and history of our people. Hence my historyies  my plays of Napoleon, Cromwell, Ben Israel, Elizabeth,

Politics  & religion won't mix. & we  are now trying to form a  political association for  women Entirely free from   religious ties, into which the  Methodist & Catholic woman  can come & work, while hold  ing her own consciencious  views. The women of other [ass-  ociations] are not willing to admit  to work with women as officers  who are in any way connected  with polygamy.  Hence some of  the best workers will have to   be left out publicly, but if they  will uphold the hands of those  who can work, One year, will  show God's providence in   this, as in all His Works.

I have felt the spirit of  reformation on me ever since I  landed on these shores and thought  verily I was preaching reformation  to the people but when we received  Prest Youngs letter dated October 30th  ^I found^ that it was but very little that I  had done and that there was a  great many things for me ^to^ repent of  that I might have more of the Holy  Spirit and to be one with my brethren  in Zion.

 and my magazines—the Western Galaxy the last—   not unworthy of New York, Boston or London.    Some of my efforts and enterprises may have  been financially unwise; and perhaps I should not  have undertaken any work of publishing with^out^ first  having sufficient capital in the bank to take me through;  but then I should never have published any book at  all, not even the Life of Brigham Young. During the  last fourteen years, since I commence the Life of Brigham  Young, a strange Providence has attended my publishing,  and from fifty to seventy-five thousand dollars have been  put into my publishing work; and yet when I went to  Brigham Young and told him I was going to write and  publish his Life I had not a dollar, nor scarcely  food or fire in my house. The same Providence will  still attend my work and put me through, but  how that Providence will manifest itself I wait to  discover.    I come now, Brethren, to the help for which I  appeal to you. I need $500 to complete my Northern  volume; $300 payable to George Q. Cannon & Sons to  purchase paper to complete the book, a draft of $100  in favor of my engravers, H. B. Halls Sons, and  $100 for me to work on the book. For this $500  Mr Cannon will, on its publication deliver to the  Bishop's Office or the President's Office one hundred and  twenty-five volumes of this said History.

 for $500, and the City 200 vols (wholesale) for $1000. These were sent  to the best journals, libraries, universities and leading men of the  nation. Thus has the History of Salt Lake City become a standard  work in both England and America, in libraries and places where  they will do good service to Utah and the Mormon people.    Acknowledgements of the gift of the City and newspaper  notices came often to the Mayor and the Author and doubtless to the  President's Office. I enclose you some addressed to me to Box B.  I have since learned indirectly that this is the President's Box.  Could I have seen the President I should have shown him these and  asked permission to retain them, as they were addressed to the Author,  and to him and his children they will be as testmonials. They will show  you that your gifts have been acknowledged by the Universities of America  and also of Oxford and Cambridge, England.    I trust, Brethren, you will aid me by this advance of $500  for 125 volumes for distribution, which I believe will be as bread  cast upon the waters. This will not only enable me to complete my  book, but financially recover me in the Spring & Summer; for I  shall not only have 2000 vols of this book, but I have 1400 vols of  the History of Salt Lake City, unbound, which (adding a chapter  to bring it up to date) I should, as soon ^as^ means are produced by the  new vol, bind up and put on the market as Second Edition  of the History of Salt Lake City. It would be a pity for me to die  as Historian and Publisher, with from ten to twenty thousand dollars  worth of good property on my hands, and yet though saleable it is  just such property and in such condition that the Banks would not  advance money on.    Hoping you brethren of the Twelve and Presiding  Bishops will help me,  I remain,  Your Servant and Brother  Edw. W. Tullidge. 
 Letter from Geo. A. Smith, dated April 21, 1856.  To Wilford Woodruff, Secretary of the Twelve Apostles.    Sir, On the 10th April 1854, I commenced to perform the  duties of Historian by taking up the History of Joseph Smith where Dr.  Willard Richards had left it when driven from Nauvoo on the 4th day of  Febuary 1846. I had to revise and compare two years of back history  which he had compiled, filling up numerous spaces which had been marked  as omissions ^on memoranda^ by Dr. Richards.    I commenced compiling the history of Joseph Smith from April 1st 1840  to his death on June 27th 1844. I have filled up all the reports of sermons  by President Joseph Smith and others from minutes or sketches taken at the  time in long hand by Dr. Willard Richards, Wilford Woodruff, Thomas  Bullock, William Clayton, Miss Eliza R. Snow, &c. which was an im-  mense labor, requiring the deepest thought and the closest application, as there  were mostly only two or three words (about half written) to a sentence.  The greatest care has been taken to convey the ideas in the prophets style  as near as possible; and in no case has the sentiment been varied that  I know of; as I heard the most of his discourses myself, was on the  most intimate terms with him, have retained a most vivid recollection of  his teachings, and was well acquainted with his principles and motives.  The History has been compiled to the day of his death, and the principal  part of it has been revised by the council of the First Presidency almost  without any alteration. A few vacancies remain to be filled up from the  statements of persons who are now absent. The severe application of thought  to the principles of the History, the exercise of memory &c. have caused  me to suffer much from a nervous headache or inflamation of the brain;  and my application of mind being in exercise both day and night,  deprived me of a great portion of necessary sleep.    Thomas Bullock acted with me as chief clerk, being a clerk  in the History office previously to, and at the time of Prest. Smith's  death, and has continued in it ever since. His pen wrote the principal  part of the rough manuscript from my dictation, and his acquaintance  with all the paper was of great assistance to me.

I am a young  man somewhat inexperienced  but with the assistance of  God I shall endevour to do  all the good that lays in my  power.    I shall prepair myself  to be ready to start from  this City on October 10th 
 we ^have^ a good and holy man to lead  us who is continually clothed with  the Spirit of revalation and whose  instructions to us are as the voice  of the Lord and whose admonitions  may we ever regard as true and  faithful and worthy of the confidence  of all who profess the Gospel of  Jesus Christ. We have been with him  in prosperity and adversity in sickness  and in health in public and private  and in various situations in life  where men may reasonably associate  with each other and we do know  and this is the testimony that I bare  to this generation that his teachings  are sacred and true, his character  untarnished and it is beyond the  power and wisdom of this world high  or low rich or poor to prove to the   contrary or bring the first accusa-  tion against him.    I have a very extensive and  exceedingly interesting field of  labour and I can say that it is  one of the greatest schools that I  ever was in and I am anxious  to improve the time and do all the  good I can while I have the chance  for I find that while I am teaching 
 1856  April    Jonathan Grimshaw sorted and filed the papers, and carefully  amalgamated the principal part of the discourses of President Smith  and others from the various reports mentioned above, and put them  into shape to be filled up by me. He also assisted in writing the  Manuscript of the History from my dictation, compiled indices, and per-  formed other duties incident to the office.    Leo Hawkins assisted to file papers, copied correspondence, and  wrote the final copy of the History in Books C2. and D2 after revision; besides  attending the office business generally.    Robert L. Campbell copied the rough manuscript of the History  into books D1 and E1 which were revised by the Presidency and  council. He also assisted to perform the general duties of the office is    John L. Smith and James Ure have assisted me in making  Indexes for the Neighbor, Guardian, and Deseret News, in collecting matter  and making the scrap books.    The plan of compiling the history of Joseph Smith from the  journals kept by his clerks, Willard Richards, William Clayton, Wilford  Woodruff, and Thomas Bullock, was commenced by himself, extracting items  of necessary information in regard to general and particular movements  from the Times and Seasons, Millennial Star, Wasp, Neighbor and other  publications, extracts from city councils, Municipal Courts, and Mayor's dock-  ets and Legion Records, which were all kept under his direction; also the  movements of the church as found in Conference minutes, High Council  records, and the records of the several quorums, together with letters and  copies preserved on file; also noted remarkable accurrences throughout the  world, and compiled them under date of transaction, according to the  above plan which he while in prison just previous to his murder re-  quested Elder Willard Richards to continue; which trust Elder Richards  fulfilled as far as he could while he lived, and would have completed  it had not the mob violence to which he was subjected prevented  him. I assisted Dr. Richards during about 70 days in revising and col-  lecting matter for the History while in Nauvoo, which made me acquainted  with his plan of compilation, which I have pursued as near as possible, con  sidering the different circumstances; and I am positive that no history  could be more absolutely correct in its statements, as the genuineness of  every statement admitted into it is unquestionable.    There have been kept under my superintendence; an office Jour-  nal, containing a general sketch of the transactions of the Presidency and  the church at the present time; a book of Incidents of History, containing  Conference minutes, Reports &c. and a Book of Obituary notices.

The proof and revise of the History in the Deseret News have been  read in my office. I have also assisted in conducting the news when the  Editor was sick or absent.    I also got up a synopsis of the History for the Peoples Journal  by Prest. B. Young's request.    There have been 878 pages, averaging 700 words to a page, written  in the large History books, there are 600 pages ready to be copied from  the first books to the second, and there is manuscript now compiled  which it is estimated will fill upwards of 400 pages in each set of books.    I have attended two sessions of the Legislative Assembly while  the above was going on, and my clerks were the clerks of the Legis-  lature during their sitting.    I have three times visited Iron County which I represented in  the Legislative Council, and with my clerks made the compilation of the  Laws of Utah in 1855. I have preached on Sabbath days, and  at other times, in different parts of the counties of Davis, Great Salt  Lake, Utah and Juab. I have visited Provo and other parts of Utah  County sixteen times, and have acted as President when there; and by  the direction of Prest. B. Young, I have married several hundred couples  under the law of sealing in that county and south of it, during the  above visits, and have carefully reported every one of them to the General  recorder of marriages. I have also kept up a continual correspondence  with the News, giving a general outline of the local news, and history  of the progress of the different towns and settlements I have visited.    During the month of November 1855 I was confined to my room  by sickness caused by too close application to business since I was ap-  pointed Historian; during which time I have not spent twenty days  exclusively to my individual business.    I have paid $6700 cash tithing, and have not received any-  thing for services, but have fallen in debt on account of individual and  family expences about $100000, which I should have avoided if the grain

 1856  April    crops in the North part of Iron and Utah Counties had not been  destroyed by grasshoppers. My family have manufactured the principal  part of their own winter clothing.    At the April Conference in 1856, Elder Wilford Woodruff was  appointed assistant Historian, and since that time I have taken  every pains to make him acquainted with the transactions and  routine of the office.    I was elected by the people of Iron County a Delegate to  the  convention to form a constitution for a state Government: which  met in G. S. L. City on the 17th of March 1856, and on the 26th  of March 1856 I was elected by the Convention one of their Dele-  gates to convey the constitution to Congress, and ask for the admission  of the State of Deseret into the Union. On the 7th day of april  my nomination was submitted to the people and unanimously ac-  cepted.    I have arranged to start for Washington to morrow morning    Geo. A. Smith    Exd  G. S. L.

 Salt Lake City, Sept. 24, 1888.    President Woodruff,    Dear Brother:    In answer to your letter of the 20th inst. in which  you desire my opinion respecting Brother Locander's suitableness as a missionary,  I would say that his antecedents are unknown to me; I suspect, however, from what I  can learn that before joining the Church he led a fast life. He came here from  California, having passed through Utah on his way to that place. While there he  came across the Voice of Warning, and was so impressed with it that he determined  to investigate Mormonism the next time he came this way. -[He is naturally of a  roving disposition: although he had arrived in California he had no intention of  remaining there.]- He came here from Oregon; and one of the first things he did  was to visit the Museum wrere he found Brother Schofield, through whom, after five  consecutive days talk, he was converted to our faith. After joining the Church  he inquired about the law of tithing; and reckoning his outfit, which consisted of  his trunk, books, etc., to be worth $50.00, he paid $5.00 as tithing. He worked  along the most part of the time earning from 12 to 15 dollars per month, until he  obtained the position he now occupies at Z.C.M.I. He has been re-baptized once,  having indulged in drink. He attends meetings regularly, and appears to be as

 yet I would like to doo all  I could to be free again and  work for my family, and fulfill my  ^mission.^ Now, dear brother, will you do  me the favor of writing a line  or two to Bro. F. S. Richards  and ask him to do for me wh-  at he can; it may have a tend-  ency of a favor towards me of  his side. If I knew his addres  s I would write to him, but I  will wait a little while now, ho-  ping that you will be so kind  and not take offence at my  freedom. Your kindness to-  wards me in the past time  has caused me to ask you  for this favor, hoping that thes-  e lines will find you, well  in health, that you may yet  have many years to lead the  work of the Lord onward, inand

 Richmond Mo, Feby 3rd 1888    Dear Brethren:    It has pleased the Lord to  take from our midst our dear aged Brother David  Whitmer. God alone knows how we mourn his loss,  yet we know that it pleased God to take him,  because the righteous purposes and work of God must  roll on. The Testator has died: His testimony that  the Truth is now established, and the Book of  Mormon and Bible was true, was given by him on  his death bed; therefore, as he has sealed his testimony  with his death, it is now in full force to the  condemnation or justification of the world.  Upon his death bed he gave us his testimony in  these words; "I know the work is set up;  Truth is established; Hold fast to the Rock."  By the same spirit as he gave this testimony, he bore  his testimony to the truth of the Book of Mormon.  O brethren and sisters, we cannot describe to you  in a letter, what we have seen and heard, and  what the Lord has made known to us through  our dear brother in his dying hours. Only those who  saw and heard can fully feel and know these  great things in their fullness. We can only write  a part of these testimonies; and when we see  you face to face, and can talk with you in   the Spirit, then we will tell you more, for we  know that these things are strength and comfort to  all who are in Christ Jesus our Lord.

He answered that his work was done;  and God's will, not his, be done: and if it pleased  the Lord to let him remain some years to see  the work move on, well and good; and if it  pleased the Lord to take him hence, well and  good. He would read the replies to his pam-  phlet in the Heralds, and we would ask him if  he did not want to answer answer such and  such things which were in the Herald, and send  the answers forth to the Latter Day Saints; so  the honest in heart might not be led wrong, but  know the truth. He would always tell us that  the honest in heart would have their spiritual  eyes opened in God's own due time, and they  would then understand and receive his pam-  phlet; that he had born his testimony in the  pamphlet concerning all these things, and his  work was done: that he would not make a  single reply to the Herald, no matter what they  would say; that he would not carry on a  debate or disputations with them. He said,  that when a servant of God had born his testimony  to a people, if that people openly rejected it and  desired only to refute and contend against it because  of their blindness to the truth, that that servant  had rid his garments of their blood, and his  work was done: And for him to keep up a  contention with those people, he would come  under that condemnation where Christ says that

Salt Lake City, Utah, Sept. 22, 1888  President Wilford Woodruff  Salt Lake City,    Dear brother,    In answer to your kind  communication of yesterday, allow   me to say, that I feel perfectly   willing to do whatever the   Lord requires me to do; I have  no higher desire than to be in   His hands and performe this  work.    A mission to Turkey would   indeed be a granting of a  secret desire of my heart, long  cherished, because that mission   would make it possible for   me to se Palestine (I hope),   to visit some of the sacred   spots, of which I have read

 quently, know whether  it has been decided to  call me or not.    Br. Jack, at the President's  office told me, he had  been instructed to pay  me $150 in cash, and the  balance in tithing orders.  This arrangement would  be nearly satisfactory, if  I am not called on the  before mentioned mission,  But if I am, then I feel  that I must very respect-  fully ask you to instruct  Br. Jack to pay all the  amount, or nearly all, in  cash or in orders equal to  cash in value.    It will take me nearly  one half of the appropriated  $403 to pay a little debt,  contracted during very trying  times in this Territory, and  what little equipment I  need for myself and for  my wife, before I leave her,  etc: And I suppose that  the remaining $200 are  the very least so lon a  journey can be under-  taken with.    In consideration of   these circumstance I would  ask, if it be possible to  get the $200 still due  me in some other pay-  ment than thil tithing  orders. Of course I would  not any of till the  day I am going on  the mission.    Please let me know  about this matter,  if possible, Thursday  or Friday. After Friday 
 contention was of the devil, and that disputations  must be done away. O brethren, what a lesson  we have learned from our dear brother on this  point. We now see that a true servant of God,  bears his testimony to certain truths, and there he  lets the matter rest, to the condemnation or  justification of the hearers: but all who are not  true servants will not rest but desire contention  disputation and debate continually; for in this  they delight, because they can display their wit and  human wisdom: but the servant of God desires to  please God only and not men, and is meek and  lowly in heart, caring not what man will say or  [th]ink. May God help us to be like our departed  brother in this respect. Hear what he says in the  con[cl]usion of his pamphlet; "Brethren, I have this  to say in conclusion, I will not argue and  dispute with you. In the spirit of love and  meekness I have told you what the Spirit of God  has moved upon me to speak. I am now past  82 years of age, and my work in this world is  about done. [FIGURES] My days to stay here are not  many more; I soon go to rest with those who   have gone before me; but I have rid my garments  of your blood and the blood of all men."  Brethren, we have told you before about the prophecy  which Bro. Joseph Smith gave in 1834 to Bro. David.  We have the old yellow time worn paper, among the  sacred papers of our dear brother. This prophecy  has been fulfilled. It says of Bro. David that  "he shall be a ruler in Zion when he is old and   well stricken in years. He shall say to the faithful,  'Go forth, and build up the waste places of Zion.'"  Brethren, he has said it! Let us go forth to the  work! May God be with us to keep us humble, meek

Hintze is a personal friend of  mine, a brother who preached   the gospel to me in Norway,  and one whom I much love.    I must state, however,  that I have not very much  confidence in my own abil-  ity as a missionary proper.   My line is more, perhaps,   on the literary field.

 I now can,  provided  the Church can let me  have the $200 still due  me in cash.  I would  not have asked for this  favor, had not my cir-  cumstances necessitated  it.  But having recently  been married I found  myself placed under the  necescity of spending  the most of what I have  already received on furnishing  a couple of rooms for my  wife during my absence, and  if I cannot have a little  more cash, I am sorry  to say that I do not at  present see my way clear  to meet the heavy expenses,  involved in so  long a  journey.  If, however, the  Church can furnish me  this cash, I shall willingly  offer every cent of it on  this very important mis-  sion.  Please let me  know, therefore, at an  early date, what decision  you come to, and I  will be ready to come  to the city at the 11th or  12th of November, so as to  leave on the 14th.

 and lowly in heart, that we may depend solely  upon Him who is able to accomplish a great  work through his weak and humble servants.  And may we at all times have the spirit of love  with us; not only for our brethren who love us, but  for all men, even our enemies; those who hate us  and persecute us, let us love them in return,  and show to them by our words and actions  that we do in reality love them in return.  All who can not do this, have not yet been born  of the Spirit, and can not see the kingdom of  God. No one is yet qualified to labor in the  masters vineyard, unless he can go forth in this  spirit of love as described so plainly by our Lord  and Saviour Jesus Christ. Above all things  brethren, let us remember this. Love—it is the fulfilling  of the whole law. It, and it alone is the key by  which we can unlock the gates of heaven, and  enter therein when we shall have done with this  life. Happy is he who posesses it continually.  Having it only at times will not ^suffice.^ do The wicked  have it at times. We must be of this spirit  continually, if we expect to inherit the first  resurection. Our dear brother David was of this  spirit continually. May we grow in grace until  we have reached this mark.    Not long after Bro. David had selected his funeral  text, he was taken to his bed. During his feeble  condition, Bro. E L Kelly of the Reorganized church  came here to see him. This was last spring. He told  Bro. Kelly that he had selected his funeral text,  and that his work was done; that he did not expect  to remain here very much longer. He had Bro. Kelly  read this text, which was Rev. 22:14. He also told

 him that he had said in his pamphlet, and had  written Bro. Joseph that he loved him and loved  his father; but that Bro. Joseph had doubted  this and did not believe him. He told Bro.  Kelly that his had caused him much grief,  and our dear Bro. David began to cry like  a child. O brethren, we will never forget that  time. Our hearts were full. Bro. Kelly's heart was  full. When he was Bro. David was through  crying, he told Bro. Kelly that Bro. Joseph did  not know what love was. To this Bro. Kelly  made no reply: but his heart was filled with  the love of God, and he knew and realized that  he was in the presen prescence of a grand old  man of God, whose heart was ^also^ filled with the  love of God; who had become as a little child,  whose heart was warm and tender and full of  the Holy Spirit of the master.    Many of the Latter Day Saints still accuse Bro. David  of ambition, and a spirit of leadership. Brethren,  such a thing is ^was^ as far from him as language  could express. Of all men we have ever known,  he was the most meek and humble, and had the  least pride and ambition. We have only to read  his pamphlet on this subject, to see that he had no  such desires. He wrote the pamphlet because God  moved upon him to write it; just the same as  He moved upon his servants of old to write their  testimony; just the same as he moved upon Paul to  write to the Galations and others who had erred  from the true gospel and doctrine of Christ.    Many of the Latter Day Saints do not believe Bro. David  when he says in his pamphlet that he loves them;  but we, brethren, can testify before God that he

 did love them and that he has greived and  sorrowed much because of them: And we can also  testify that we have the same spirit toward them  as our dear Bro. David had.    Bro. David recovered from the spell of sickness he had  last spring, and enjoyed good health through the  summer. Last October he was taken with a cold on  his lungs, which was the beginning of his late  weakness. The cold wore off and left him in a  very weak condition. He had no disease, but was  simply weak and feeble. He grew more and more ^feeble^  up to his death, which occured Jan. 25th, [I] on  wednesday at 5 oclock PM. His mind was clear  as the noon day up to the time he breathed his last  breath. On sunday previous to his death, about 4  oclk PM, he told us to send for certain brethren,  and for Dr. Geo. W Buchanan (an old friend whom  he has know almost 50 years), say^ing^ he wanted to   bear his dying testimony to the truth of the Book  of Mormon. At about 530 PM those brethren and  Dr. Buchanan—also Mr. Geo. I Wasson,  another friend—had all arrived at the house.  He first asked for Dr. Buchanan to state to those  present, whether or not he was in his right  mind, before he gave his dying testimony. The  Daoctor replied, "Yes, you are in your right  mind for I have just had a conversation   with you." He then addressed himself to all  who were in the room and said, "Now, you  must all be faithful in Christ. I want to say  to you all the Bible and the Record of  the Nephites is true; so you can say that  you have heard me bear my testimony  on my death bed. All be faithful in  Christ and your reward will be according  to your works. God bless you all. My trust  is in Christ

 forever, world without end. Amen." This testimony  to the truth of the Book of Mormon and Bible, he  gave to go forth to unbelievers in the Book of Mormon  In a few minutes after he boy bore this testimony, Dr.  Buchanan and Mr. Wasson left the house. Those who  were present with ^him^ during his dying hours, to whom  he the Lord revealed through him great and  marvelous things, were the brethren and sisters of  the church of Christ ^who reside here.^. He continued from Sunday  at 530 PM evening to wednesday evening the time  of his death, in being three days, in this weak  condition of body, but his mind was strong and  clear up to his death: And O brethren, the many  great things he uttered to us with the power of  God upon him: Though weak in body, ^at times^ he would  have us sit him up in the chair so he could  speak with power and force; and in his weak  and dying condition, he would raise his hands to  his and eyes to heaven, and speak by the power of  the Holy Ghost. Brethren, it is impossible for us  to attempt to describe in a letter, and impossible  for you to feel and realize, the great things that  we have hea heard, and seen, and felt, and know.  Those who saw and heard, know that it would be  wisdom to only tell ^certain^ such things to certain ones. Things  that are of God and sacred, must be told only by  the guidance of the Holy Spirit. Some of the things  that we ^can^ speak of in this letter are as follows.  On monday morning, Bro. David as had certain  brethren sit him in his arm chair. While in the chair  he raised his eyes and hands to heaven and had a  vision. While in this vision, with uplifted eyes and  hands to heaven, among other things he said, "I  see Jesus.
