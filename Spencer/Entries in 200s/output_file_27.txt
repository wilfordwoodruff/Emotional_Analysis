I submite this to us so great andimportant matter to your kind and fatherly con-sideration, praying that you may decide for usto go to the Lord's house for the blessings therof.Before I close, I wish to mention, what I long de-sired to do, but waited for an opportunity ofpersonally meeting you, and it is this:When I first came to Zion I was so much dis-turbed and exited in my mind, that there maysome misunderstandings have taken place, and in thisshape some things have been represented to you, andcaused you to doubt; but looking now back tothe exitement of the first days after my arrivalin Zion, having been in a constant exitement causedby the peuple in nearly all the Wards in S. Lake,I do not wonder that misstatements occured.I am thankfull today that things are better, and it is my desire to go on humble before my Lordin serving Him and keeping His commandments tothe best of my knowledge and understanding.It is also also my hearts desire to be directedin my future labors by you, and I place my-self with all my heart and soul subject toyour counsel and directions as a Prophet of God.

 Historians and apostles yourselves, you will thoroughlyunderstand the vastness of the subject and record of yourown lives, and the cost to gather and bring all into book formindependent of publishing. But, being anxious to writethe history of Utah in the interest of the Mormon people,I started with this Northern Volume, designing next aSouthern Volume; and so, with three volumes, magnebrought up to date, magnificently illustrated with $20,000 ofsteel plates of the men who founded this Territory, Utah wouldhave a published history not unworthy to live. No merepublisher, as a financial venture, could publish 3 such volumeswith a limited circulation: the steel plates alone requiring acapital of twenty thousand dollars. But I have been backedwith the money and friendship of great generous men; andthe steel plates, like my histories, have been the accumulationsof years. I scarcely need tell you this, as the money of PresidentYoung, have and Geo A. Smith, Wilford Woodruff, LorenzoSnow, Geo. Q Cannon, F. D. Richards, Moses Thatcher, WmB. Preston and many others of your own class, with HooperJennings, Eldredge, and monied men of the Gentiles haveso greatly helped me in my work.This work of writing these histories of Utah and theMormon people has not been, with Edward Tullidege, a mereauthor's effort for fame and bread, nor a publisher'sspeculation. It has been regarded by me from the onset— even before Franklin Richards called me to the MillennialStar Office thirty three years ago—as the work and missionof my life, to help to create for the Mormon people a worthynational literature, of a semi-Hebraic type, correspondingwith the genius and history of our people.

During thelast fourteen years, since I commence the Life of BrighamYoung, a strange Providence has attended my publishing,and from fifty to seventy-five thousand dollars have beenput into my publishing work; and yet when I went toBrigham Young and told him I was going to write andpublish his Life I had not a dollar, nor scarcelyfood or fire in my house.

 for $500, and the City 200 vols (wholesale) for $1000. These were sentto the best journals, libraries, universities and leading men of thenation. Thus has the History of Salt Lake City become a standardwork in both England and America, in libraries and places wherethey will do good service to Utah and the Mormon people.Acknowledgements of the gift of the City and newspapernotices came often to the Mayor and the Author and doubtless to thePresident's Office. I enclose you some addressed to me to Box B.I have since learned indirectly that this is the President's Box.Could I have seen the President I should have shown him these andasked permission to retain them, as they were addressed to the Author,and to him and his children they will be as testmonials. They will showyou that your gifts have been acknowledged by the Universities of Americaand also of Oxford and Cambridge, England.I trust, Brethren, you will aid me by this advance of $500for 125 volumes for distribution, which I believe will be as breadcast upon the waters. This will not only enable me to complete mybook, but financially recover me in the Spring & Summer; for Ishall not only have 2000 vols of this book, but I have 1400 vols ofthe History of Salt Lake City, unbound, which (adding a chapterto bring it up to date) I should, as soon ^as^ means are produced by thenew vol, bind up and put on the market as Second Editionof the History of Salt Lake City. It would be a pity for me to dieas Historian and Publisher, with from ten to twenty thousand dollarsworth of good property on my hands, and yet though saleable it isjust such property and in such condition that the Banks would notadvance money on.Hoping you brethren of the Twelve and PresidingBishops will help me,I remain,Your Servant and BrotherEdw.

 Letter from Geo. A. Smith, dated April 21, 1856.To Wilford Woodruff, Secretary of the Twelve Apostles.Sir, On the 10th April 1854, I commenced to perform theduties of Historian by taking up the History of Joseph Smith where Dr.Willard Richards had left it when driven from Nauvoo on the 4th day ofFebuary 1846. I had to revise and compare two years of back historywhich he had compiled, filling up numerous spaces which had been markedas omissions ^on memoranda^ by Dr. Richards.I commenced compiling the history of Joseph Smith from April 1st 1840to his death on June 27th 1844. I have filled up all the reports of sermonsby President Joseph Smith and others from minutes or sketches taken at thetime in long hand by Dr. Willard Richards, Wilford Woodruff, ThomasBullock, William Clayton, Miss Eliza R. Snow, &c. which was an im-mense labor, requiring the deepest thought and the closest application, as therewere mostly only two or three words (about half written) to a sentence.The greatest care has been taken to convey the ideas in the prophets styleas near as possible; and in no case has the sentiment been varied thatI know of; as I heard the most of his discourses myself, was on themost intimate terms with him, have retained a most vivid recollection ofhis teachings, and was well acquainted with his principles and motives.The History has been compiled to the day of his death, and the principalpart of it has been revised by the council of the First Presidency almostwithout any alteration. A few vacancies remain to be filled up from thestatements of persons who are now absent. The severe application of thoughtto the principles of the History, the exercise of memory &c. have causedme to suffer much from a nervous headache or inflamation of the brain;and my application of mind being in exercise both day and night,deprived me of a great portion of necessary sleep.Thomas Bullock acted with me as chief clerk, being a clerkin the History office previously to, and at the time of Prest. Smith'sdeath, and has continued in it ever since. His pen wrote the principalpart of the rough manuscript from my dictation, and his acquaintancewith all the paper was of great assistance to me.

Smith and James Ure have assisted me in makingIndexes for the Neighbor, Guardian, and Deseret News, in collecting matterand making the scrap books.The plan of compiling the history of Joseph Smith from thejournals kept by his clerks, Willard Richards, William Clayton, WilfordWoodruff, and Thomas Bullock, was commenced by himself, extracting itemsof necessary information in regard to general and particular movementsfrom the Times and Seasons, Millennial Star, Wasp, Neighbor and otherpublications, extracts from city councils, Municipal Courts, and Mayor's dock-ets and Legion Records, which were all kept under his direction; also themovements of the church as found in Conference minutes, High Councilrecords, and the records of the several quorums, together with letters andcopies preserved on file; also noted remarkable accurrences throughout theworld, and compiled them under date of transaction, according to theabove plan which he while in prison just previous to his murder re-quested Elder Willard Richards to continue; which trust Elder Richardsfulfilled as far as he could while he lived, and would have completedit had not the mob violence to which he was subjected preventedhim. I assisted Dr. Richards during about 70 days in revising and col-lecting matter for the History while in Nauvoo, which made me acquaintedwith his plan of compilation, which I have pursued as near as possible, considering the different circumstances; and I am positive that no historycould be more absolutely correct in its statements, as the genuineness ofevery statement admitted into it is unquestionable.There have been kept under my superintendence; an office Jour-nal, containing a general sketch of the transactions of the Presidency andthe church at the present time; a book of Incidents of History, containingConference minutes, Reports &c. and a Book of Obituary notices.

 1856AprilI have also written Historical letters monthly for insertion in the Millen-nial Star, Mormon, Luminary, &c.There are also two large scrap books, into which interesting and histor-ical items from Newspapers &c have been pasted.The census returns of 1856 were copied in my office; also Indexesmade to the Deseret News, Times and Seasons, Neighbor, Millennial Star &c.A large amount of testimony has also been written from the verbalstatements of individuals, which was afterwards embodied in the Manu-script of the History; also affidavits taken for the same purpose.The proof and revise of the History in the Deseret News have beenread in my office. I have also assisted in conducting the news when theEditor was sick or absent.I also got up a synopsis of the History for the Peoples Journalby Prest. B. Young's request.There have been 878 pages, averaging 700 words to a page, writtenin the large History books, there are 600 pages ready to be copied fromthe first books to the second, and there is manuscript now compiledwhich it is estimated will fill upwards of 400 pages in each set of books.I have attended two sessions of the Legislative Assembly whilethe above was going on, and my clerks were the clerks of the Legis-lature during their sitting.I have three times visited Iron County which I represented inthe Legislative Council, and with my clerks made the compilation of theLaws of Utah in 1855. I have preached on Sabbath days, andat other times, in different parts of the counties of Davis, Great SaltLake, Utah and Juab. I have visited Provo and other parts of UtahCounty sixteen times, and have acted as President when there; and bythe direction of Prest. B. Young, I have married several hundred couplesunder the law of sealing in that county and south of it, during theabove visits, and have carefully reported every one of them to the Generalrecorder of marriages. I have also kept up a continual correspondencewith the News, giving a general outline of the local news, and historyof the progress of the different towns and settlements I have visited.During the month of November 1855 I was confined to my roomby sickness caused by too close application to business since I was ap-pointed Historian; during which time I have not spent twenty daysexclusively to my individual business.I have paid $6700 cash tithing, and have not received any-thing for services, but have fallen in debt on account of individual andfamily expences about $100000, which I should have avoided if the grain

 1856Aprilcrops in the North part of Iron and Utah Counties had not beendestroyed by grasshoppers. My family have manufactured the principalpart of their own winter clothing.At the April Conference in 1856, Elder Wilford Woodruff wasappointed assistant Historian, and since that time I have takenevery pains to make him acquainted with the transactions androutine of the office.I was elected by the people of Iron County a Delegate tothe  convention to form a constitution for a state Government: whichmet in G. S. L. City on the 17th of March 1856, and on the 26thof March 1856 I was elected by the Convention one of their Dele-gates to convey the constitution to Congress, and ask for the admissionof the State of Deseret into the Union. On the 7th day of aprilmy nomination was submitted to the people and unanimously ac-cepted.I have arranged to start for Washington to morrow morningGeo. A. SmithExdG. S. L. CityApril 21, 1856 
 Salt Lake City, Sept. 24, 1888.President Woodruff,Dear Brother:In answer to your letter of the 20th inst. in whichyou desire my opinion respecting Brother Locander's suitableness as a missionary,I would say that his antecedents are unknown to me; I suspect, however, from what Ican learn that before joining the Church he led a fast life. He came here fromCalifornia, having passed through Utah on his way to that place. While there hecame across the Voice of Warning, and was so impressed with it that he determinedto investigate Mormonism the next time he came this way. -[He is naturally of aroving disposition: although he had arrived in California he had no intention ofremaining there.]- He came here from Oregon; and one of the first things he didwas to visit the Museum wrere he found Brother Schofield, through whom, after fiveconsecutive days talk, he was converted to our faith. After joining the Churchhe inquired about the law of tithing; and reckoning his outfit, which consisted ofhis trunk, books, etc., to be worth $50.00, he paid $5.00 as tithing. He workedalong the most part of the time earning from 12 to 15 dollars per month, until heobtained the position he now occupies at Z.C.M.I. He has been re-baptized once,having indulged in drink. He attends meetings regularly, and appears to be as

 Richmond Mo, Feby 3rd 1888Dear Brethren:It has pleased the Lord totake from our midst our dear aged Brother DavidWhitmer. God alone knows how we mourn his loss,yet we know that it pleased God to take him,because the righteous purposes and work of God mustroll on. The Testator has died: His testimony thatthe Truth is now established, and the Book ofMormon and Bible was true, was given by him onhis death bed; therefore, as he has sealed his testimonywith his death, it is now in full force to thecondemnation or justification of the world.Upon his death bed he gave us his testimony inthese words; "I know the work is set up;Truth is established; Hold fast to the Rock."By the same spirit as he gave this testimony, he borehis testimony to the truth of the Book of Mormon.O brethren and sisters, we cannot describe to youin a letter, what we have seen and heard, andwhat the Lord has made known to us throughour dear brother in his dying hours. Only those whosaw and heard can fully feel and know thesegreat things in their fullness. We can only writea part of these testimonies; and when we seeyou face to face, and can talk with you in the Spirit, then we will tell you more, for weknow that these things are strength and comfort toall who are in Christ Jesus our Lord.Last spring, soon after Bro.

We told him we wantedhim with us yet many years if it was God'swill, and urged him to not think aboutdying. He answered that his work was done;and God's will, not his, be done: and if it pleasedthe Lord to let him remain some years to seethe work move on, well and good; and if itpleased the Lord to take him hence, well andgood. He would read the replies to his pam-phlet in the Heralds, and we would ask him ifhe did not want to answer answer such andsuch things which were in the Herald, and sendthe answers forth to the Latter Day Saints; sothe honest in heart might not be led wrong, butknow the truth. He would always tell us thatthe honest in heart would have their spiritualeyes opened in God's own due time, and theywould then understand and receive his pam-phlet; that he had born his testimony in thepamphlet concerning all these things, and hiswork was done: that he would not make asingle reply to the Herald, no matter what theywould say; that he would not carry on adebate or disputations with them. He said,that when a servant of God had born his testimonyto a people, if that people openly rejected it anddesired only to refute and contend against it becauseof their blindness to the truth, that that servanthad rid his garments of their blood, and hiswork was done: And for him to keep up acontention with those people, he would comeunder that condemnation where Christ says that

 contention was of the devil, and that disputationsmust be done away. O brethren, what a lessonwe have learned from our dear brother on thispoint. We now see that a true servant of God,bears his testimony to certain truths, and there helets the matter rest, to the condemnation orjustification of the hearers: but all who are nottrue servants will not rest but desire contentiondisputation and debate continually; for in thisthey delight, because they can display their wit andhuman wisdom: but the servant of God desires toplease God only and not men, and is meek andlowly in heart, caring not what man will say or[th]ink. May God help us to be like our departedbrother in this respect. Hear what he says in thecon[cl]usion of his pamphlet; "Brethren, I have thisto say in conclusion, I will not argue anddispute with you. In the spirit of love andmeekness I have told you what the Spirit of Godhas moved upon me to speak. I am now past82 years of age, and my work in this world isabout done. [FIGURES] My days to stay here are notmany more; I soon go to rest with those who have gone before me; but I have rid my garmentsof your blood and the blood of all men."Brethren, we have told you before about the prophecywhich Bro. Joseph Smith gave in 1834 to Bro. David.We have the old yellow time worn paper, among thesacred papers of our dear brother. This prophecyhas been fulfilled. It says of Bro. David that"he shall be a ruler in Zion when he is old and well stricken in years. He shall say to the faithful,'Go forth, and build up the waste places of Zion.'"Brethren, he has said it! Let us go forth to thework! May God be with us to keep us humble, meek

 and lowly in heart, that we may depend solelyupon Him who is able to accomplish a greatwork through his weak and humble servants.And may we at all times have the spirit of lovewith us; not only for our brethren who love us, butfor all men, even our enemies; those who hate usand persecute us, let us love them in return,and show to them by our words and actionsthat we do in reality love them in return.All who can not do this, have not yet been bornof the Spirit, and can not see the kingdom ofGod. No one is yet qualified to labor in themasters vineyard, unless he can go forth in thisspirit of love as described so plainly by our Lordand Saviour Jesus Christ. Above all thingsbrethren, let us remember this. Love—it is the fulfillingof the whole law. It, and it alone is the key bywhich we can unlock the gates of heaven, andenter therein when we shall have done with thislife. Happy is he who posesses it continually.Having it only at times will not ^suffice.^ do The wickedhave it at times. We must be of this spiritcontinually, if we expect to inherit the firstresurection. Our dear brother David was of thisspirit continually. May we grow in grace untilwe have reached this mark.Not long after Bro. David had selected his funeraltext, he was taken to his bed. During his feeblecondition, Bro. E L Kelly of the Reorganized churchcame here to see him. This was last spring. He toldBro. Kelly that he had selected his funeral text,and that his work was done; that he did not expectto remain here very much longer. He had Bro. Kellyread this text, which was Rev. 22:14. He also told

 him that he had said in his pamphlet, and hadwritten Bro. Joseph that he loved him and lovedhis father; but that Bro. Joseph had doubtedthis and did not believe him. He told Bro.Kelly that his had caused him much grief,and our dear Bro. David began to cry likea child. O brethren, we will never forget thattime. Our hearts were full. Bro. Kelly's heart wasfull. When he was Bro. David was throughcrying, he told Bro. Kelly that Bro. Joseph didnot know what love was. To this Bro. Kellymade no reply: but his heart was filled withthe love of God, and he knew and realized thathe was in the presen prescence of a grand oldman of God, whose heart was ^also^ filled with thelove of God; who had become as a little child,whose heart was warm and tender and full ofthe Holy Spirit of the master.Many of the Latter Day Saints still accuse Bro. Davidof ambition, and a spirit of leadership. Brethren,such a thing is ^was^ as far from him as languagecould express. Of all men we have ever known,he was the most meek and humble, and had theleast pride and ambition. We have only to readhis pamphlet on this subject, to see that he had nosuch desires. He wrote the pamphlet because Godmoved upon him to write it; just the same asHe moved upon his servants of old to write theirtestimony; just the same as he moved upon Paul towrite to the Galations and others who had erredfrom the true gospel and doctrine of Christ.Many of the Latter Day Saints do not believe Bro. Davidwhen he says in his pamphlet that he loves them;but we, brethren, can testify before God that he

 did love them and that he has greived andsorrowed much because of them: And we can alsotestify that we have the same spirit toward themas our dear Bro. David had.Bro. David recovered from the spell of sickness he hadlast spring, and enjoyed good health through thesummer. Last October he was taken with a cold onhis lungs, which was the beginning of his lateweakness. The cold wore off and left him in avery weak condition. He had no disease, but wassimply weak and feeble. He grew more and more ^feeble^up to his death, which occured Jan. 25th, [I] onwednesday at 5 oclock PM. His mind was clearas the noon day up to the time he breathed his lastbreath. On sunday previous to his death, about 4oclk PM, he told us to send for certain brethren,and for Dr. Geo. W Buchanan (an old friend whomhe has know almost 50 years), say^ing^ he wanted to bear his dying testimony to the truth of the Bookof Mormon. At about 530 PM those brethren andDr. Buchanan—also Mr. Geo. I Wasson,another friend—had all arrived at the house.He first asked for Dr. Buchanan to state to thosepresent, whether or not he was in his rightmind, before he gave his dying testimony. TheDaoctor replied, "Yes, you are in your rightmind for I have just had a conversation with you." He then addressed himself to allwho were in the room and said, "Now, youmust all be faithful in Christ. I want to sayto you all the Bible and the Record ofthe Nephites is true; so you can say thatyou have heard me bear my testimonyon my death bed. All be faithful inChrist and your reward will be accordingto your works. God bless you all. My trustis in Christ

This testimonyto the truth of the Book of Mormon and Bible, hegave to go forth to unbelievers in the Book of MormonIn a few minutes after he boy bore this testimony, Dr.Buchanan and Mr. Wasson left the house. Those whowere present with ^him^ during his dying hours, to whomhe the Lord revealed through him great andmarvelous things, were the brethren and sisters ofthe church of Christ ^who reside here.^. He continued from Sundayat 530 PM evening to wednesday evening the timeof his death, in being three days, in this weakcondition of body, but his mind was strong andclear up to his death: And O brethren, the manygreat things he uttered to us with the power ofGod upon him: Though weak in body, ^at times^ he wouldhave us sit him up in the chair so he couldspeak with power and force; and in his weakand dying condition, he would raise his hands tohis and eyes to heaven, and speak by the power ofthe Holy Ghost. Brethren, it is impossible for usto attempt to describe in a letter, and impossiblefor you to feel and realize, the great things thatwe have hea heard, and seen, and felt, and know.Those who saw and heard, know that it would bewisdom to only tell ^certain^ such things to certain ones. Thingsthat are of God and sacred, must be told only bythe guidance of the Holy Spirit. Some of the thingsthat we ^can^ speak of in this letter are as follows.On monday morning, Bro. David as had certainbrethren sit him in his arm chair. While in the chairhe raised his eyes and hands to heaven and had avision. While in this vision, with uplifted eyes andhands to heaven, among other things he said, "Isee Jesus. O if I could only raise my feet andunderstanding to my faith, I could make one
