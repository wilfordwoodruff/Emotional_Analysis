I am at all times subject to the direction of the authorities, and if it is desir- ed that I go on the mission mentioned at once I will do so. I desire to state, however, that I am considerably involved financially and am carrying quite a large interest in the Salt Lake and Los Angeles Ry.

Presuming upon their mention of you, I wish to make some inquiries concerning a party of whom you may have known at some time. I was born and raised in Kirtland O. not many miles from Kirtland. A great meny years ago a Mormon preacher by the name of mother's Nauvoo Mo. The family have never heard of her since. I have tried many times to find out what became of her but never succeeded. Did you ever know aught of them? Her maiden name was Buckingham and she lived at Bundysburgh, O. She still has a sister living within 4 miles of the Mormon Temple at Kirtland O. I dare say there are many there yet whom you remember well. If you ever knew aught of her or if any of your people who once lived at Nauvoo, or if she has any children living you will confer a great favor by putting me in communication with them.
