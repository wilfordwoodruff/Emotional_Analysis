 Levi Naylor  Jan. 29 [18]97    It seems very clear to me  that he should be hon-  orably excused. With his  resources, his statement  being true, he would not  be able to provide for his  family, and also for the  expenses of his mission  besides he must be in years  as his boys are married  and moved to themselves.  Let him be released  with the understanding  that when ever he feels  able to go & desires to do  so, he can so inform us  J.F.S.

Whilst he was living in Washington City, and after having two   lectures from him the Secretary wrote this:    Boston, August 21, 1893.    REV. SCOTT F. HERSHEY, PH.

B. F. BRADBURY, Secretary Music Hall Course, Boston.    How He Came to Boston.    It was in 1893 that Dr. Hershey came on from Washington   City to lecture in Boston. At this time the First Presbyterian   Church was without a Pastor. A delegation from the Church   heard him lecture twice, and asked him to consider a call. In the   spring of 1894 he accepted a call to the Church, which stands in   the lead of Presbyterian Churches in New England. The Church   is attended by hundreds of young people and at night the preach-  ing is attended by people from all over Boston and the towns about.  In addition to his Church work, the Doctor is lecturing every Sunday   afternoon, and from one to two nights a week.    THE BOSTON NEWSPAPERS    Scott F. Hershey is a young, eloquent and convincing orator, whom  all should hear.—Boston Globe.    No speaker in the remarkable Music Call Course of six years, em-  bracing many of the most eloquent men of the country, is better entitled  to the terms "Orator," Scholar," and "Patriot," than is Dr. Hershey.—  The Boston Herald.    The lecture in the celebrated Music Hall Course was delivered by   Scott F. Hershey, Ph. D., of Washington, D. C. More than two thou-  sand were present, and the frequent, vociferous applause abundantly   testified to the speaker's eloquence. At one time the great audience   at Dr. Hershey's lecture went wild with enthusiasm, rising in a body to   their feet, cheering, and even standing on the seats, as they gave vent to   their feelings.—Boston Citizen.

 REMARKS  By Elder Wilford Woodruff, Tabernacle, Dec 6  1857.    [REPORTED BY G. D. WATT. ]    I esteem it a privilege at all times to join   with my brethren in bearing testimony of the  work of God. I am satisfied that we, as a peo-  ple have great reason to rejoice for the privil-  eges and blessings granted unto us in these  valleys of the mountains by our Father in heav-  en. We are in a great school, and it is a pro-  fitable one, in which we are receiving very im-  portant lessons from day to day. We are  taught to cultivate our minds, to control our  thoughts, to thoroughly bring our whole being   into subjection to the Spirit and law of God,   that we may learn to be one and act as the   heart of one man, that we may carry out the  purposes of God upon the earth. Yes, we are  taught many principles which tend to our ex-  altation and glory, which could not be made   manifest unto us only as they are revealed unto  us by the inspiration of the Almighty through  the mouth of his servants the Prophets.    The principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ   are made plain to us by the figures and illus-  trations which have been made to-day and   which are made from time to time, so plain,  that a child could not misunderstand; also to   impress upon our minds our duties. Those   principles are not surrounded with that mys-  tery that shrouds the doctrines taught by the  sectarian world.    We, as a people, have long been praying for   the kingdom of God to come and His will to be   done on the earth as it is done in heaven. We   have been taught this prayer from childhood,  but neither we nor our parents understood  what we were praying for, only we made a   practice of uttering those words from tradition,  and never understood the meaning until we   were made acquainted with the Gospel of Jesus  Christ. Since we have become acquainted   with br. Joseph and the gospel we have looked  forward with much interest to the day when  the kingdom of God should be established up-  on the earth in the same light, power and glory  in which the Apostles and Prophets saw it by   vision and revelation, and that all which God   has promised concerning it should have its ful-  fillment.    During the last twenty or twenty-five years  many things have been prophecied; and the  Lord through his servants has made many   promises which have been revealed unto us  concerning the blessings that are in store for  us if we faithfully do our duty. I can say  with my brethren that I rejoice that I am  in these valleys of the mountains associated   with the people of God a thousand miles from   christianity, civilization and the fruits thereof,  at least such as is now manifest throughout the  christian world, and I feel to prize this bles-  sing and to acknowledge the hand of God in  leading us here, for the hand of God has been   plainly visible in delivering us from the hands   of our persecutors and planting us in a land  of health, peace and safety; and the more my  mind is enlightened by the Holy Spirit the more  precious and glorious do these principles ap-  pear unto me.    I am satisfied that all is right in Zion. All   is right with those who lead us. All is right  as far as we do right. We have enjoyed many  blessings during the past year. The Lord has   in his mercy poured out his Holy Spirit upon us   as a people, and there is a great change with  the inhabitants of Zion during the past year.   We were in a great measure asleep, and the  Lord knowing the things which lay before us  poured our is Holy Spirit abundantly upon our lead-  ers who called upon us to wake up, and the   Spirit of God was poured out upon the people  and they have, in a great measure, endeavoured  to repent, forsake their sins and unite them-  selves together to carry out the counsels of his  servants. I have never seen the hearts of this  people so united as during the past year. No  person who has listened to the words of the   Presidency of this church during a few months  past and has seen the fulfilment of their say-  ings, but can clearly see the hand of God  with them and His Spirit guiding them contin-  ually.    The day that many of us have anticipated  since we have been made acquainted with Jos-  eph Smith and the gospel, has began to dawn  upon us. The revelations of Jesus Christ are fast  fulfilling before our eyes. We see the king-  dom set up; and the time has come when the   nation that has given many of us birth has  entered the field as our open enemies and per-  secutors and commenced an unhallowed perse-  cution against us, with a determination to des-  troy us from off the earth. The same as cities,   towns, counties and states have done before  them, they have united together to crush and  destroy this people and remove them, if possi-  ble, from the earth.    Ever since I have been made acquainted   with the Gospel and the progress of this peo-  ple, I have always believed that the United   States would take this course and in a nation-  al capacity and under the form of law, seek to   destroy the Church and kingdom of God from   off the earth. For the light has come unto   them and the gospel of salvation offered unto   them and they have rejected it, and killed the  prophets; hence the light and Spirit of God is   taken from them, sin abounds, and they are   filled with anger against all that is good. Their  course is unconstitutional and contrary to every  principle of law, righteousness, justice, judg-  ment and truth. In all our persecutions our   persecutors have had no just cause for pursuing   the course against us they have, only they were   stirred up by the devil. Darkness, wickedness  and abominations of every kind are increasing   in the minds of the wicked nations of the earth  because the Spirit of God is withdrawing from   them. They have had the fulness of the ev-  erlasting gospel offered unto them, but they   have rejected it.    There has never been a set of men since the  Lord made the world who have laboured more  diligently then the Twelve Apostles and El-  ders of this church in preaching the gospel to  the world. They have rejected the message  sent to them revealed by an angel from God,   which leaves them now under condemnation.  Br. Joseph would have embraced the whole  circle of the human family in the principles of   salvation if he had possessed the power. He   had the greatness of soul never seen in the  human breast unless it was inspired by the  power of God. That same spirit has rested  upon the present Presidency of this church,  they have laboured incessantly for years to save  the children of men. And what have we re-  ceived in return from the hands of the chris-  tian world? They have driven us from our   homes and fire sides and smitten and robbed   us of the rights that are dear and most sacred   to man, until we have at last been driven from   the borders of civilization, so called, unto the  wilderness by the nation that has given us  birth, whose boasted freedom exists only in   name. Here they expected we should perish,  but we still live, grow and flourish in these  mountains, through the mercy and goodness of  God, without the aid or assistance of our per-  secutors.    Our nation was under no condemnation in   this respect until the light came and they heard   the gospel, rejected it, and cast out the Saints  from their midst, slaying their leaders and   depriving thousands of the Latter Day Saints  who were American citizens of every blessing,   right and privilege guaranteed unto them by  the Constitution and laws of the United States.  Many of our nation have been guilty of crimes  in their persecutions against us that would cost  the lives of presidents, governors, senators,   legislators, and many thousands of men if law   and justice were executed in righteousness  against them. I do not know what more they   can do to fill up the cup of their condemnation   than to carry out the course they have begun.   There is more crime, wickedness, and abomin-  ation committed now throughout the United   States, according to the population, in twenty-  four hours—a thousand times—than there was  thirty years ago. I do not suppose there has  been a generation more wicked and corrupt  than the present christian world.    We have been told to-day that we are under  great obligation to God, and that we ought to  acknowledge his hand in all things. That is   true. We had no knowledge of the plan of   salvation until God revealed it unto us. We   are dependent upon God and his servants for  light, and truth, and blessings that are in store  for us.    We are told that the kingdoms of this world  will become the kingdoms of our God and his   Christ. Daniel of old says this, and pointed   out the establishment of that kingdom in the  last days which should stand forever and not  be thrown down. He also pointed out the ef-  fects which would follow. The Lord has al-  ready revealed great and glorious truths and  principles concerning the government of the  children of men in the establishment of his  church and kingdom upon the earth. Does it   not require as much wisdom and revelation from  God to govern the nations of the earth in a  way to bring men into subjection to righteous laws,  light, privileges and blessings which they  are now deprived of in the organization of  temporal governments of the world, as is re-  quired in the spiritual government of the church   of Christ upon the earth. Where is that know-  ledge to flow from? The spirit to do men good  and relieve the sufferings of mankind does not   dwell in the breasts of monarchs, kings, presi-  dents and rulers among the nations of the earth   at the present day; but sorrow, crime, poverty,  tyranny, oppression and starvation prevail   throughout the world.    The rulers of mankind have not sought for  the Spirit of God and the light of eternity to  show them the responsibility they are under to  Him who has raised them to power and au-  thority and given them dominion over their  fellow beings; they have not exercised their  power and authority to honor God and redress   the wrongs of the poor and oppressed over   whom they preside.    The misery and evils which now exist  throughout the world have got to be corrected  in a great measure, through the power of God,   before the kingdoms of this world will become   the kingdoms of God and his Christ. It is a  great and mighty work to establish the king-  dom of God on the earth, that the law may go  forth from Zion to rule the kingdoms of the   world. The light, knowledge, truth and wis-  dom to do this has got to come through the  Holy Priesthood, which is the government of   God upon the earth.    Our temporal and eternal salvation is all con-  nected and linked together as we have been   told to-day. The Lord has raised up unto us   fathers, leaders, and counselors after his own   heart; they possess his will and they are lead-  ing the people to exaltation and glory. If we   take their counsel we shall receive all the sal-  vation men can desire in time and in eternity.   I thank God that I have lived to see the dawn   of this glorious day.    With regard to the dealings of the Lord with  us this present season. President Brigham Young|Young has   been as calm and serene as a summer's morn-  ing, and so have his counsellors, and that spirit  in a great measure has been diffused among  the people. When there was every appear-  ance outwardly of our enemies coming upon  us, the spirit with them has been all the time  "We do not believe we shall have to go to bat-  tle or shed the blood of our enemies this sea-  son." This has been the feeling when, to all  human appearance it would seem that we would  have to shed the blood of our enemies or they  ours. There is not such an example on history   as the way in which our enemies have been  stayed from fulfilling their hellish designs. It  is the first time the American army has been  stayed in their course. They got as far as Ham's   Fork and there they stuck. We have heard  read their gracious proclamation. Many of  the brethren wonder that they have not the wis-  dom enough to make out a decent document,  but I do not wonder at it, for this whole peo-  ple have prayed that their natural wisdom   might be taken from them. I should wonder  if they had wisdom to make a sensible  document or one that would pass an examina-  tion.    The Lord so far has fought our battles and  has proved his people. When men have been  called upon to go out and lie in the path of the  enemy, I have not known one instance of a  man refusing to go. All have been willing to  go and do as they were told. The Lord has  proved you in this and has accepted your offer-  ing. The prayers of the Saints of God have  been heard, and they will never fail of being   heard and answered if we do our duty, for we  have a ruler who can do something for us  when our cause is just. I feel as br. Taylor   said to-day. It matters not to me what the  Lord designs of us, we should be passive in his  hands.    When different opinions were expressed as to  the course to be pursued this fall with our enem-  ies, the Spirit has said to me at the time, be still   and passive, and pray that wisdom may be given  to President Young to dictate, and lead just right.  There is where our prayers should center, we   should continually call upon the Lord to inspire   him with wisdom sufficient to lead forth the church  and kingdom of God unto exaltation, glory, and  victory.    It is different with us than with the world, we  have a main channel thro' which to receive our   light, knowledge and blessings, as was beautifully  illustrated by the President in the figure of the

 REMARKS.  By Elder WILFORD WOOD-  RUFF, at the Funeral Service of  Elder William Pitt, in the Four-  teenth Ward Assembly Rooms, Salt  Lake City, Sunday morning,   Feb. 23, 1873.    REPORTED BY D. W. EVANS.    My friends here kindly granted me   the privilege of making some open-  ing remarks on this occasion. I had   an appointment in Ogden to-day,   but when I heard of the death of  Brother Pitt I felt as though I  wanted to attend his funeral. If   I had heard that one of my own  family had dropped dead I should   not have been more surprised than  I was when I heard of the death of   Brother Pitt. I was conversing   with him in the street, I think the  day before he was hurt, and he was   then, apparently, cheerful, comfort-  able, well and happy. When I   heard that he was dead, I imme-  diately went to his house, visited   his family and saw his body. I will  say that I seldom or ever give way   to weeping, either for the living or  the dead, but upon this occasion,   when I saw his body lie cold in  death, all the early scenes of my   acquaintance with him in the   Herefordshire mission rushed upon   me like a whirlwind, and I confess  that I manifested a good deal of  weakness in giving way to weeping  before the family. Solomon says  there is a time to weep and a time  to laugh, a time to mourn and a   time to rejoice; and there are times  when reason will excuse weeping.   Anthony said, "I come to bury  Caesar, not to praise him," yet An-  thony did, on that occasion, por-  tray before the Senate and citizens  of Rome the virtues of Caesar in his  public life. We have come to bury   Brother Pitt, and I do not consider  it wrong to speak of the virtues and   good deeds of the dead any more  than of those of the living.    My first acquaintance with Bro-  ther Pitt was of such a character as  to cause the formation of ties be-  tween us of no ordinary nature, as  it is, I may say, with all the asso-  ciations of the elders of Israel. The  world knows nothing about these  ties. The ties they form together  are very different from those form-  ed between the servants of God,  who are associated together in the  holy priesthood and by the power   of the Holy Ghost and the inspira-  tion of the Lord our God. These are  ties that no men comprehend un-  less they occupy the same position  that we occupy. I have found this  in my whole career with this church  and kingdom. I love the brethren  and the Saints of God, because we  are associated together in a great,  noble and Godlike cause; and these   associations are to ourselves, and   what more can a man do than lay  down his life for his friend? How   many are there in this room and in  this church and kingdom, who, in   case of necessity, would be willing   to lay down their lives to save  their brethren? There are thousands of   them.    I wish, and feel that it is my pri-  vilege, to refer to my first acquain-  taince with Brother Pitt, whose  body lies before us to-day. The   history of the Herefordshire mission  is before the world and before the   Church, and I wish in a few words   to refer to that mission, for it was   there that I became acquainted  with Brother Pitt. Brother Taylor  and I were the first two of the Quo-  rum of the Twelve who arrived in  England in 1840. Brother Taylor   went to Liverpool, and I went to   the Staffordshire potteries. I labored   there with Brother Alfred Cordon,  who is now in the spirit world.  We were preaching almost every   night, and we baptized some near-  ly every meeting. It was a very   good mission.    Some eighty miles from there, in  Herefordshir, there were people   who had never seen a Latter-day  Saint, and never heard the gospel.   Some six hundred of them had bro-  ken off from the Wesleyan Metho-  dists, and called themselves the   "United Brethren." They were  under the presidency of Elder   Thos. Kington. They were searching   for light and truth. As a body they   had called upon the Lord, and had   advanced just as far as they could  with what light they had. They   prayed to the Lord that he would   open the way before them, that  they might advance in the things  of his Kingdom. While in this  position I went one evening to fill   an appointment in the Town Hall,  at the town of Hanley. There was  a very large congregation, and I   had appointments out for two or   three weeks in that town and   adjacent villages. As I went to   take my seat the Spirit of the Lord   came upon me and said to me,   "This is the last meeting you will  hold with this people for many   days." I was surprised, because I  did not know, of course what the  Lord wanted me to do. I told the  assembly when I rose, "This is the last  meeting I shall hold with you  for many days." They asked me   after meeting where I was going.   I told them I did not know. I   went before the Lord in my closet  and asked him where he wished me   to go, and all the answer I could  get was to go to the South. I got  into a stage and rode eighty miles  south, as I was led by the Spirit of  the Lord. The first man's house I  went into was John Benbow's.   He lives now down here at Cotton-  wood. I had some conversation  with Brother Benbow and I told   him that the Lord had sent me to  that place. But without wishing  to dwell on this subject particularly   I will say that I learned that they   weresix hundred people there, under  Elder Kington, called United   Brethren, and that they had been   praying to the Lord for guidance   in the way of life and salvation.   Then I knew why the Lord had sent   me to that place—he had sent, them  what they had been praying for.   I commenced preaching the gos-  pel to them, and I also commenced   baptizing, Elder Pitt being among   the first who was baptized by me   into this church and kingdom.  The first thirty days after I arrived  there I had baptized forty-five  preachers, which flung nearly fifty  preaching places, licensed by law,  into my hands; and out of the six   hundred belonging to Elder King-  ton's body all were baptized but one  in seven months' labor. I brought  eighteen hundred into the church   in that mission, and I will say that  the power of God rested upon me   and upon the people. There was   a spirit to convince and a people   whose hearts were open and ready  to receive the gospel. And as  Jesus said in reference to John,  that all Judea and Jerusalem went   out to John's baptism I felt as if   all Herefordshire was coming to be  baptized. The third meeting that  I held at Brother Benbow's the  rector of the place sent a constable   to take me up. I was just about to   begin when he entered. I said to  him, "Take a chair until after meet-  ind and I will attend to you." He  sat down and when I got  through he came forward and I   baptized him with others. He  went back and told the rector, "If  you want to take up that man you  must go yourself, I have heard him  preach the first gospel sermon I   ever heard in the world." Almost   every man that came to meeting   was baptized.    I did not see Elder Kington for   some little time after going there;   and when I did see him he came to  me as the leader of the people. I  laid before him the gospel. He   said, "If it is true, I wish to em-  brace it; if not, I shall oppose it."   I said, "That is right." But I   made a covenant with him. I said  to him, "If you will go before the   Lord and ask him if this work is   true, I promise you in the name of   the Lord Jesus Christ that you   shall receive a testimony for your-  self if you will promise to obey it."   He said he would, and he went   away to attend to his appointments.  The next time he came to Brother   Benbow's, a few day's afterwards, I   asked him if he had enquired of   the Lord. He said he had. "What   did the Lord tell you." "He told  me it was true;" and he then said   he was ready to obey the gospel,  and I baptized him. I name this   because as soon as Brother Pitt   heard this Gospel he obeyed it, and  he was one of the leading men in  the choir of the Church of Eng-  land in Dimock. I now wish to re-  late a circumstance concerning   him. The first meeting I held in  Elder Kington's house Brother   Pitt was present. I will say first,  however, that Mary Pitt, brother   Pitt's sister, was something like  the lame man who lay at the gate   of the Temple called "Beautiful" at   Jerusalem—she had not been able  to walk a step for fourteen years,   and confined to her bed nearly half  that time. She had no strength in  her feet and ankles and could only   move about a little with a crutch  or holding on to a chair. She   wished to be baptized. Brother  Pitt and myself took her in our   arms, and carried her into the wat-  er and I baptized her. When she  came out of the water I confirmed   her. She said she wanted to be   healed, and she believed she had  faith enough to be healed. I had had   experience enough in this church  to know that it required a good deal   of faith to heal a person who had   not walked a step for fourteen   years. I told her that according to   her faith it should be unto her. It   so happened that on the day after   she was baptized Brother Richards  and President Brigham Young  came down to see me. We met at  Brother Kington's. Sister Mary   Pitt was there also. I told Presi-  dent Young what Sister Pitt wish-  ed, and that she believed she had   faith enough to be healed. We  prayed for her and laid hands upon  her. Brother Young was mouth,  and commanded her to be made  whole. She laid down her crutch   and never used it after, and the  next day she walked three miles.   This created a great deal of anger  and madness in the feelings of the  rector of that town. We had bap-  tized Brother Pitt, and this took  one from his choir of singers, and  he felt angry. We were holding a   meeting at Elder Kington's house  one evening, when these things   were taking place. The house had   very heavy shutters on the win-  dows of the first storey. We had  these shutters closed, and I rose to  preach. The rector came at the head   of about fifty men armed with rocks   about the size of a man's fist, or  larger than that. They surround-  ed the house, and for about half an   hour the house was battered with  rocks like a hail storm, the whole   of the windows of the second storey   being stove in and the glass all bro-  ken. I told Brother Pitt that I  would go and see these men. He   said, "No, I will go, you will be in-  jured if you go." He went out into the  midst of this mob, of about fifty, I  should judge, I do not know the num-  ber. He took their names, and the   rector was the leader. They stoned   Brother Pitt back to the house, but   as we had finished meeting they   left. We had to clear the house of  broken glass and rocks before we   could retire to bed. I name this be-  cause it was one of Brother Pitt's  first labors with me, and I will say   that from that time until the pres-  ent he has been a true and faithful   servant of God, and of this church.    Associations of this kind have   been formed by all the Elders of   Israel who have gone abroad into  the vineyard to preach the gospel.   We go forth and gather strangers to   us in the flesh, but they embrace   the same testimony and gospel with   ourselves. This was the case with  Brother Pitt. I do not mourn for  him, I did not when I was at his  house; but all these scenes and early  associations rushed on my mind,   and as I gazed upon him, and  thought of the way he had been  stricken down, taken away from us,   when to all human appearance he  was but an hour before, as it were,   enjoying health and strength and  attending to the duties of life, I  realized that in the midst of life we   are in death.    In his associations with this  church and kingdom Brother  Pitt was leader of the Nau-  voo brass band for a long   time; he has also been associated  with the various bands here; and in  his associations with the peo-  ple he made a great many  friends, to whom he was en-  deared because of his many virtues   and good deeds, and his disposition  and desire to serve God. I am cer-  tainly glad to see so many friends  gathered together to honor his re-  mains. When I realize that a man  like him has lived, heard the gos-  pel, embraced it and has fulfilled   the measure of his day, what can  we say about him? Can we mourn   because he is gone? Bless your soul,  he is with Joseph to-day, and with  others of the elders of Israel, and he  rejoices with them. Whether his   spirit is here witnessing his funeral  services I can not say, it is not re-  vealed to me; but suffice it to say  that he is happy, and blessed   are the dead that die in the Lord,   from henceforth saith the spirit   for they rest from their labors   and their works do follow them.    I do not know whether Brother   Pitt has preached much in the  world, but I do know that he has  labored for the benefit of the Saints  of God. But he will preach now.  He has gone to the other side of the  vail, and he will preach there to   large assemblies of spirits. He has  been faithful and he will receive a   crown of life. His body will lie in  the tomb a few years, and but a  few. His death is a loss to his wife  and children, and the parting is   grievous. But how glorious is the  thought that there is a victory over   the grave! In Adam all died, but  in Christ all are made alive. Christ   was the first fruits of the resur-  rection. This is a glorious though  t to me when I see a Latter-day   Saint lie down with the harness   on, true and faithful until he has   wound up his work.    Out of that 1800 which we baptiz-  ed in Herefordshire in seven   months, I hardly know one that   has turned against this church.  There has been less apostacy out of   that branch of the church and   kingdom of God than out of   the same number from any part of  the world that I am acquainted   with.    We are called every day or two to  bury some of them. A good many  of them are still living. Some of   them are bishops—Bro. Clark, Bro.   Rowberry, and a good many of  them scattered all through this  Territory. Old father Kington is   still living or was the last I heard  of him, though near the grave.   They are passing away, and when   I went to see Brother Pitt's body,   the thought came to me, Whose turn  go next? May be mine, may be  yours, we can not tell anything   about it. These things should be   an admonition to us to be true and  faithful while we dwell here. The  thought that we can obey and be  sanctified by the gospel, and be   prepared thereby to inherit eternal   life, is one of the most glorious  principles ever revealed to man. I  thank God that I have been associated  with such a class of men and wo-  men as those who are gathered to-  day in the valleys of the mountains.   They are the people whom the   Lord has chosen. We have a hope  that the world knows not of, and  it can not enter into their thoughts.  Unless they are born of the Spirit  of God, they can not even see the  kingdom of God, and they can not  get into it unless they are born of  the water and of the Spirit, hence  they can not share in the joyous  anticipations and hopes that we  possess. Their eyes, ears and hearts   are not opened to see and hear and   feel the power of the gospel of   Christ.    Brother Pitt has gone before his   family to prepare a place for them.  I say to them, let your hearts re-  joice before the Lord. You are left   alone, he has gone before you, but  he will prepare the way. He is not   going to lie in the spirit world with-  out having something to do. There  those who have gone before us have   something to do as well as we have   here. They are laboring to prepare  the inhabitants of the spirit world   for the coming of Christ, the same  as we are trying to prepare the in-  habitants of the earth for the  same great event.    I do not wish to occupy a great  deal of time, but I will say to my   brethren and sisters this morning,   It is better to go to the house of  mourning than to the house of  feasting. Death is the end of all  men. The living should lay this  to heart. My associations with  Brother Pitt have been of the most   joyful and consoling character. We   associated together a good while in   that land, while I dwelt there; and   we have been since, both in Nau-  voo and this place. I was always  glad to meet him. I met him of-  ten in the streets, and we scarcely   ever met without referring to for-  mer times, and if I can only have  as good a glory, and lie down as he  has—die the death of the righteous  —and have as good a reward, I  shall think myself very well off. I  consider that when a man has em-  braced the gospel, continued faith-  ful, received his endowments and  the sealing blessings of God upon  his head, as Brother Pitt has, he  has accomplished the object for   which he was created.    In closing my remarks I will say   that I am thankful for the associa-  tions I have had with Brother Pitt,  and with the rest of my brethren  and the Saints. This is the gospel of  Christ; this is the Zion and King-  dom of God.  The hand of God is   stretched out for the salvation of   this people, and however dark the  clouds may appear; however strong   persecution, oppression and opposi-  tion may become to this work, the  Lord has, from its commencement,  until to-day watched over its inter-  ests, and has sustained and pre-  served it, and he will continue to  do so until its consummation; until  Zion arises and puts on her beauti-  ful garments, and all the great   events of the last days are accom-  plished. Then, in the morning of  the first resurrection, Brother Pitt   will come forth, and he and his   family will be reunited, and they   and all the faithful will receive   their exaltation. This is a glorious   thought! We should prize our   families, and the associations we   have together, remembering that if   we are faithful we shall inherit  glory, immortality and eternal life,  and this is the greatest of all the  gifts of God to man.    I pray that God will bless you,  that he will comfort the hearts of  the family of Brother Pitt, that he   will feed and clothe them, and   unite them together, and preserve   them in the faith, that when they  get through with this world, they   may meet their companion and be  prepared with him to receive exal-  tation and glory, which may God  grant in the name of Jesus, our Re-  deemer,  amen.

 gas pipe. You may take the smartest men that  talent and learning ever made and put them in the  church of God, and they never can get ahead of   their leader. Their wisdom would be turned into  folly. Why? Because they are not called to lead.  If a man has never learned a letter of a book, if   the Lord calls upon him to lead the church and  kingdom of God, he will give him power to do it.   We have had these lessons laid before us day after  day, calling upon us to be united, and our hearts  to become as the heart of one man, that our pray-  ers and works may be centered to one point in   carrying out the counsel of our head.    The Lord will lead President Young where he   wants him to go. We know God is with him,  and has led him all the time; and he led Joseph   while he lived. The Quorum of the Twelve may   exhaust their talent and acquirements in exhibiting  principle upon any matter which belongs to the  head to reveal, and yet the Prophet has to point  out the error, and set us right. The whole church   may unite to carry out any point that ought to   come thro' the head, and we could not effect it. It  requires br. Brigham to tell us what is right and  what is wrong in many things, because that is his   place and calling. There is a perfect channel ex-  ists between the Lord and him, through which he   obtains wisdom, which is diffused through other   channels to the people. That we know. We   have got to learn to bring this knowledge into  practice.    Let this people go to work and sustain the   head of this Church all the time, and let their  prayers continually ascend in his behalf, that  God may give him wisdom for our guidance.  Then no matter if armies approach us, or all hell   boils over. Let the people be perfectly passive  in the hands of God, live their religion and learn   and profit by the daily lessons they receive. Then  you will find that glory, victory, and prosperity   will abide with this kingdom.    I do not believe that any general since the  Lord made the world, has been the subject of   more earnest prayers than Gen. Wells has since   he has been out in the mountains. He has been  well sustained, and so has President Young. I  hope we may increase in this until we arrive at   perfection. Then you will see clock work, per-  fect harmony, and the effects of it wherever it  is manifest; whether it be in a Bishop over  his Ward, in the Twelve Apostles, in a President over   a branch of the church, or in a father over his  family. You will obtain blessings by thus sus-  taining every man in his place and calling, you  can not get by any other principle. But cross a   Bishop, a Prophet, or a father over his family in   their track, and you will see a friction immedi-  ately, you will see trouble, difficulty, darkness  and affliction, and nothing will go right. This is  the principle that will save this kingdom, and lead  it forth to glory, victory and salvation.    We have been driven and afflicted for twenty-  five years, and gained an experience we now begin   to profit by; that we might attain power to judge  properly of contrasts, and of right and wrong.  Had President Young and this people remained   undisturbed in Kirtland from [18]34 till this time, we  could not have gained the same experience we   now have; therefore, I believe that hand of God   has been in all that we have passed through. The   experience of the First Presidency of this church  has been very great. No man that lives has pas-  sed through the same school; therefore, their  great knowledge and wisdom, aided by the inspir-  ation of the Almighty.    I do not know what the intention of the Lord   is as to us in the future, but victory is promised   unto this people.    The kingdom of God is in the valleys of the  mountains, and we enjoy its blessings. That   should be sufficient for us. As to outward losses,  they are of little consequence. The law of God   is in the mouths of those who are set to lead us.   If the Lord should give a revelation through them  that would appear contrary to our traditions, our  customs, or reveal new principle, things which  have been hid from the foundation of the world,  it should not try the faith of the Saints. The Lord  has given revelations according to the capacity of  the children of men.    If there was a point where man in his progres-  sion could not proceed any further, the very idea   would throw a gloom over every intelligent and   reflecting mind. God himself is increasing and   progressing in knowledge, power and dominion,   and will, worlds without end. It is just so with   us. We are in a probation, which is a school of  experience. It is a blessing to breathe the element  that is in this place; to behold the unity of the  people in trying to bring their wills into subjection   to the will of the Lord their God.    I am glad we are here, and our enemies where  they are. Those of us who have been here for   some ten years can not realize the great contrast  between Utah and the rest of the world; we hard-  ly know how to prize our privileges. Were we  placed in any of the large cities of the United   States and Europe, we should hardly believe we   were in the same world. The sounds of blas-  phemy are not heard in our streets, rioting, drunk-  enness, whoredom, rape and murder, and the black  catalogue of crime practised in the Christian world  do not meet the eye or salute the ear of the pas-  ser by in Utah. The contrast between the city  of Great Salt Lake and the cities of the nations   abroad, touching the order, decency, virtue, and  moral character of the people here, can not be  told.    Having been made acquainted with the gospel,   we have been trying to improve ourselves; we  have a good degree of faith in our leaders, and  tried to follow the word of God from their mouths.   We have improved in these things, and my pray-  er is that we may continue so to do and prize the   blessings, privileges, freedom, and spirit, and  power of the Holy Ghost that is poured upon us  in these peaceful valleys. We need not any longer  thirst for the things that are in the world. We  are the best off of any people. If there is any   peace, safety, or salvation, it is here.    The day is not far distant when nation will rise   against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and   state against state, and there will be sorrow such  as never was among men. Watch the signs of the  times, for we are living in an important age. The  prophecies relating to our time are rolling in upon   us; are we prepared to meet them? It is impor-  tant for men and angels to note the events of this  age. We live in the commencement of a new era   of the dealings of God with the world. The earth  has been under the dominion of the devil almost  from its creation. But in our day the Lord has   set up his kingdom, never to be destroyed.    The Lord has planted his church and kingdom   upon the earth in other ages, but those that under-  took to maintain it were soon destroyed through  the power of wicked men and devils. Righteous  men were not permitted to live upon the earth,  even the Son of God was not permitted to preach   righteousness but a short time before he and his   followers were crucified and slain, but the day has  now come when He has begun to prepare the way   that he may come and take possession of the   earth himself, and reign King of nations, as He  does now King of Saints. The day of the devil's  power to prevail against the kingdom of God has   passed away. The kingdom is within you, in the  valleys of these mountains. Brs. Joseph, and Hy-  rum, and Willard, and Jedediah, and Parley, and a   host of others who have gone behind the vail, are  as much engaged in the establishment of this   kingdom, and in our welfare as a people, as we   are.    We should prize and not abuse the blessings   God has put within our power, and improve upon  the lessons we learn, and obey the teachings giv-  en to us through the inspiration of the Holy Ghost  to the servants of God set to lead us. We have  every thing to encourage us. We are favored of  God, and whom the Lord favors who can success-  fully oppose. Would President Buchanan have  sent an army here to lay a foundation for our de-  struction if the eyes of his understanding had not  been darkened? No, if he had been enlightened   by the Holy Spirit and could have foreseen the re-  ward he will meet, he would sooner have suffered   his blood to have been spilled, and it would have  been better for him. The nation does not know  what they are doing, nor comprehend the fearful  results of the course they are pursuing. They are  turning the last key to rend the nation asunder,  and they will be broken as a potter's vessel and   cast down as a nation to rise no more for ever.  For whenever the rulers of any nation trample  their own Constitution and Laws under foot, and   oppress and destroy the weak, because they have  the power and the people love to have it so, they   sow the seeds of their own dissolution, and they   will reap their own destruction.    We have nothing to fear. The Lord is with us  and will sustain and nourish his church and king-  dom, as he has done from the beginning. He sus-  tained it when it was surrounded by the bowels  of hell in Warsaw and Nauvoo, in Jackson, Clay  and Caldwell counties when it was small as a  mustard seed, and he can sustain it here when it  is surrounded by the mountain of rocks.    The heathen may rage and imagine a vain thing,  but the Lord will hold them in derision and guide   them as with a bit and a hook in their jaws, while  his people shall flourish like a watered garden up-  on the mountains. All the promises of God will  be fulfilled unto us: a little one shall become a  thousand, and a small one a strong nation, and the   Lord will hasten it in its time. Amen.

My home is in Mexico, and when I came  to school thirteen months ago, I brought a recom-  ment from my Bishop, but did not write  with any ward here, and as the time set for  my departure will not permit me to send this  home, I have no Bishop to endorse this reply.  But I enclose a recommendation from President  Benj. Cluff Jr., with whom I lived last summer.    If this will be satisfactory, I shall be ready  at the appointed time to be set apart for my mission.    Very humbly,  Your brother in the Gospel  Chas. E. McClellan.

 REMARKS  BY   ELDER WILFORD WOODRUFF.    It is not my purpose at all to de-  tain this congregation, but before   dismissing I feel that I would like to   say a few words. We are not in the   habit of flattering any man, but I   want to say a few words concerning   Brother Pratt. If there is any man   dead or alive who has dwelt longer   in this church and kingdom than he   has I do not know him. If there is   any man that has travelled more   miles in preaching the gospel of   Christ, in bearing testimony of the   kingdom of God on the earth, I do   not know who he is. When Brother   Pratt embraced this gospel he was a   boy—in one sense of the word illiter-  ate and unlearned, the same as   Joseph Smith and the most   of us. Whatever knowledge   Brother Pratt has obtained, either   of the learning of the world or of the   kingdom of God, he has obtained it   by diligence and labor since he em-  braced this gospel. I have been as-  sociated with Brother Pratt myself   for 47 years. I have travelled with   him by sea and by land, in foreign   countries and at home, and I never   saw a man in my life that I know   of that has spent as few moments   idly as he has. I have never seen a   storm at sea so heavy—even when   shipping seas over the bow, side and   stern—but what he would read his   book. Whenever the breakers be-  came too heavy he would simply   shut up the book until they were   over. If there is a man on this con-  tinent who is more at home in the   starry heavens, in the astronomical   world than Brother Pratt I do   not know who he is. If   there is a man more deep-  ly versed in mathematics than   Brother Pratt, I do not know who he   is. There may be many men equal   to him in these things, but if there   are, I do not know them. How has   he obtained his knowledge? He   has obtained it since he embraced   this work. He has improved his   time. Brother Pratt is the only   living man to-day that was in the   first quorum of the Twelve in its   first organization, and I am pleased   to listen to his testimony of the gos-  pel of Christ; for I want to say to   Brother Pratt and to all other men,  we all have to acknowledge this;   Joseph Smith, Brigham Young, the   Apostles, and all men in this   Church and kingdom, if there is   anything to us, if there is anything   about us, if we have any knowledge,   or any power, or any influence, we   have to give God the honor of it. It   is not of ourselves. Joseph Smith   always acknowledged this, as have   all men in this Church and King-  dom. We have been called from the   plow, from the plane, from the ham-  mer—ignorant, illiterate boys, and   thrust into the vineyard; and all the   power we have, or ever had, in   building up this Kingdom, we have   to acknowledge it as coming from   the hand of God. Brother Pratt was   one of the earliest men who shoul-  dered his knapsack and travelled   through this American continent to   preach the gospel of Jesus Christ to   this nation. Frequently he would   suffer from ague all day and go along   and preach his sermon at night.   These are experiences that he and   others have passed through in the   early rise of this Church, and I feel   to thank God that we can still hear   his voice and the voice of others   who have been long in this   Church and Kingdom. I hope   the Lord will preserve his life   until he is satisfied with it. He has   lifted up his voice long and loud, ac-  cording to the commandment of   God to him, in bearing record of this   gospel and kingdom to the nations of   the earth. I was struck in my mind,  in contemplating our own experi-  ence, with some of the remarks he   has made to-day with regard to the   Apostle Philip—how our own expe-  rience has agreed with that of the   ancient apostle. How many times   have we been called by revelation to   go to the right or left, here, there   and the other place, contrary to our   expectation? I will here relate what   took place in my own experience. I   was in Staffordshire in the year 1840.   I was in the town of Stanley and   held a meeting in the City Hall. I   had a week's appointments out in   that town. Before I rose to speak to   the people, the Spirit of the Lord   said to me, "This is the last meeting   you will hold with this people for   many days." I told the congrega-  tion when I rose what the Spirit of   the Lord had manifested to me.   They were as much surprised as I   was. I did not know what the Lord   wanted, but I saw the purpose of God   afterwards. The Spirit of the Lord   said to me, "Go south." I traveled   eighty miles; went into the south of   England. As soon as I arrived, I   met John Benbow. It was clearly   made manifest to me why I had   been called thither. I had left a good   field, where I was baptizing every   night in the week. When I got to   this place, I found a people—some   600 of them—who had broken off   from the Wesleyan Methodists and   formed themselves into a sect called   the United Brethren. I found they   were praying for light and truth,  and that they had gone about   as far as they could go. I   saw that the Lord had sent   me to them. I went to work amongst   them and ultimately baptized their   superintendent, forty preachers and   some 600 members; I baptized every   member of that denomination but   one. Altogether some 1800 were bap-  tized in that field of labor. I sup-  pose some of those then baptized   may be in this congregation to-day.   I name these things to show how   we have to be governed and control-  led by the revelations of God day by   day. Without this we can do no-  thing. Many of our brethren who   were with us at that time and who   came to this valley, have passed be-  hind the vail. Eight of the quorum   of the Twelve who were in the flesh   and most of them with the pioneers,   to-day are in the spirit world. We   are passing away.    I know as Brother Pratt has said,   that this is the kingdom of God. Is-  rael is being gathered together.   The revelations of God are being   fulfilled, and nothing will be left   unfulfilled. Therefore, as Saints of   the living God, let us be faithful to   our testimony. We have the king-  dom of God. We are called of God   by inspiration and commandment   to warn this generation, to preach   the gospel, to gather the people, to   build up Zion, to build Temples, to   redeem the living and the dead, and   to carry out the great work which   is laid upon our shoulders, and may   God enable us to accomplish these   things for Jesus' sake. Amen. 
 REMARKS  BY  PREST. WILFORD WOODRUFF,   At Bountiful, June 26, 1881.  ----------------  REPORTED BY GO. F. GIBBS.   ------------------  There are a few of us still living in   the flesh and able to mingle with  the people, but our orbit or circuit   has become so extended that we are  a little like the courts—it takes us a   long time to get around to visit the   people.    J1175233You have had excellent counsel   this morning from our brethren.   They have taught us a portion of   the Gospel of Jesus Christ, which we  should treasure up. We occupy a  different position from any other   generation; there has never been a   generation since God made the   world that has been called upon to   perform the work that the Latter-  day Saints have. Reference has   been made to the city of Enoch.   Enoch stayed as long as he could in  this world; and through his labors a  people were sanctified who, with  himself and their city were taken   away from the earth because of their   righte[o]usness. The people of God in  no generation have been able to   dwell upon the earth only so long as   they were able to finish their mis-  sion; the wicked living contempo-  raneously with them have war-  red against them and have   conquered and overcome them   in a great measure, until many have  had to seal their testimony with   their blood. It is our lot to live in  the great and last dispensation that  God has given unto man, the dis-  pensation in which a people is to be  prepared to build up the kingdom of  God on the earth, which is to be   thrown down or overcome no more   for ever. God has called a class of   men and women who, with the ex-  ception of a few, have been per-  mitted to live out their days and die   a natural death. It is true that  Joseph Smith, who laid the founda-  tion of this work, and others, have  had to s[e]al their testimony with   their blood; and if I were to tell what  I think about it, I would say it was  ordained of God that our Prophet   and head should be sacrificed in the  manner that he was, as much as it   was ordained of God that Jesus  Christ should be sacrificed in the   way that he was; and that for two  purposes—in order that his testi-  mony might remain in force upon  all the world from the hour of his   death, to rise up and condemn this  generation who reject the Gospel of   salvation. With the exception of a  few, it has been designed, I believe,   that the Prophets and Apostles of   this dispensation should not have to   seal their testimony with their  blood, but that they should live un-  til they finish their missions on the  earth, bearing their testimony to the   truth of the work, and building up  the kingdom of God; and then they   will gather up their feeb[feet] and sleep  with the fathers, surrounded by   their children and friends. This   people and these Elders who bear  the Melchisedek Priesthood, through   the providence of Almighty God,   will not be called upon to go forth,   like David of old, and shed the blood  of their fellowman in their own de-  fense. There were many   things required of him which   will not be required at our hands;   and some things he was not permit-  ted to do, because he was a man of   blood. These are my views with re-  gard to our position.    J1175233 - 234We are called of God. We have  been gathered from the distant na-  tions, and our lives have been hid   with Christ in God, but we have not  known it. The Lord has been  watching over us from the hour of  our birth. We are of the seed of   Ephraim, and of Abraham, and of  Joseph, who was sold into Egypt,   and these are the instruments that   God has kept in the spirit world to  come forth in these latter days to

 Woodruff Arizona  Mar. 7, 1898    President Wilford Woodruff  Salt Lake City    Dear Brother In giving  my feelings in Regards to  Call which I received from   You on 4 inst Will say  I am willing to preform  any work which God sees  fit to call me to perform   and while I feel truly Honored  to be counted worthy of  such a Call I also feel  my my w[e]akness in under  takeng such a work as that  of a missionary to promulgate 
 take hold of this kingdom and build   it up. These are my sentiments  with regard to the Latter-day   Saints. I will repeat what I have  often said—there is no p[o]wer beneath   the heavens that can remove Zion   out of her place, or destroy this   Church and kingdom, as long as the  people do the will of God, for He  will sustain them, and overrule the   acts of their enemies for their good  and for the final triumph of His truth   in the earth. It is now over ffifty   years since the organization of this Church   and kingdom, and since its  birth it has continued to progress   and grow in numbers and in influ-  ence and power, and it will do so  until Zion presents herself before   the heavens in her glory, power and   dominion, as the old prophets have  seen it in vision. Then, what man-  ner of men and women ought we to   be, who are called to take part in the   great latter-day work? We should  be men and women of faith, valiant   for the truth as it has been revealed  and committed into our hand. We  should be men and women of   integrity to God, and to His   holy Priesthood, true to Him   and true to one another.   We should not permit houses and   lands, gold and silver, nor any of   this world's goods to draw us aside  from pursuing the great object  which God has sent us to perform.   Our aim is high, our destiny  is high, and we should never  disappoint our Father, nor the  heavenly hosts who are watch-  ing over us. We should not disap-  point the millions in the spirit   world, who too are watching over us   with an interest and anxiety that   have hardly entered into our hearts  to conceive of. These are great  and mighty things which God re-  quires of us. We would not be wor-  thy of salvation, we would not be   worthy of eternal lives in the king-  dom of our God, if anything could   turn us away from the truth or from  the love of it. The Lord told Jo-  seph that he would prove him,   whether he would abide in His cov-  enant or not, even unto death. He  did prove him; and although he had  the whole world to contend against,   and the treachery of false friends to  withstand, although his whole life  was a scene of trouble and anxiety   and care, yet, in all his afflictions,   his imprisonments, the mobbings   and ill-treatment he passed through,   he was ever true to his God, and true   to his friends.    J1175234I have had some reflections on the   same subject referred to by Brother Cannon. In going into the house  of Brother Call, and those of the  many of the brethren, what do we   see? We see good houses, pleasant   homes, and the inmates thereof, en-  joying the necessaries and comforts   of life. We have places to rest, we   have places to lay our heads. How   different are the circumstances that   surround us to-day in comparison   with our situation before  we came to these valleys,   and in comparison with the experi-  ence of many of the ancients. Jesus   himself, the son of the living God,   had not where to lay His head. The  foxes, he said, had holes, and the   birds of the air had nests, but the  Son of Man had not a place to lay   His head. He traveled in the midst  of poverty all the way to the cross.   We have been in the same condi-  tion. We who have been in this   Church since its early days have   known what it is to be without  homes, to travel without purse or  scrip, to go hungry and almost nak-  ed, to suffer from cold and fatigue.  When we came here the ground was   all that we had to lie upon, and we  were glad and felt to rejoice in our   hearts that God had brought us to a  place where we could lie down, if it  was upon the ground, in peace, free   from the persecution of our enemies.   God has proved us in days that are  past and gone. He has now given   us a country and a home. It has   been well said that we should be  ca[r]eful lest these conveniencies and   comforts, by which we are now sur-  rounded, should draw us from the   things of God. Remember, my   brethren, the greatest gift that God   can bestow upon us is eternal life,   and it is worth more than all the   houses and lands or the gold and   the silver upon the earth. For by   and by we will go to the grave, and   that puts [a]n end to worldly posses-  sions, as far as our using them is con-  cerned. The grave finds a home   f[o]r all flesh, and no man can take   his houses and lands, his gold and   silver, or anything else of a worldly  character, with him. We brought  none of th[e]se things with us when  we came from our previous state.   As Bishop Hunter says, babies are   born without shoes and   stockings. All the knowledge  that we can accumulate from   experience and observation, and  from the revelations of God to man  goes to show that the riches of this   world are fleeting [a]nd transitory,   while he that has eternal life abid-  ing in him is rich indeed.    J1175234 - 235 We have a great work before us   in the redemption of our dead. The  course that we are pursuing is being  watched with interest by all heaven.   There are fifty thousand millions of   people in the spirit world who are  being preached to by Joseph Smith  and the Apostles and Elders, his   associates, who have passed away.  Those persons may receive their   testimony, but they cannot be bap-  tized in the spirit worl[d], for some-  body on the earth must perform this   ordinance for them in the flesh, be-  fore they can receive part in the first  resurrection, and be worthy of eter-  nal life. It takes as much to save a   dead man as a living one. The eyes  of these millions of people are watch-  ing over these Latter day Saints.   Have we any time to spend in try-  ing to get rich and in neglecting our  dead? I tell you no.    J1175235 Here is a subject I have thought   about. David said, "Let my ene-  mies go to hell quickly.["] He  got angry, and he did some  things he should not have done. Our  Savior acted right the reverse. The   more light and knowledge a man   has, the more of the power of God   he enjoys, and the more he is able  to comprehend the things of God.   Why did the Savior say; when he   was under the agonies of death,   "Father, forgive them?" Because  He knew well [t]ha[t], although they   were blind as to what they were do-  ing, they and their posterity would  welter for 1,800 [y]ears under the  curse of God, for the deed they were   perpetrating. He knew what the   result of the shedding of his blood  would be upon the human family,   ye[t] He was sorrowful because He  knew that before he should come   again as their Shiloh the Jewish  nation would be trodden under foot   of the Gentiles. The result of their   treatment of the Savior of the world  still afflicts them. In many coun-  tries they are still persecuted and   deprived of the right of citizenship,  and are not permitted to purchase  land and hold it as personal proper-  ty. The Savior could foresee their   future, and what would befall them   and their race, until He  should come again. While   He himself suffered, He could   exclaim, knowing all the cir-  cumstances, "Father, forgive them."   Brother Tay[l]or feels the same to-  wards this nation. We should all   have the same feeling, and if we en-  joy the Spirit of God, we can over-  come that feeling which arises in the  hearts of men to resent a wrong, to   return evil for evil. Joseph went to   God, and he opened his mind by   vision, in which he saw the destruc-  tion of our nation; he saw that fam-  ine and pestilence and war would   lay waste our land, until it became   so terrible that he prayed God to   close the vision. Well may we say,  "Father, forgive them." Well may   we pray for them, and feel in our   hearts not to envy them, but leave   them in the hands of God.    J1175235 - 236 There are two spirits with us. I  will relate a little circumstance   which took place with me. I brought  President Young sick in my carriage  on July 24th, 1847, the first time he  set his eyes upon this valley. In pro-  cess of time I followed President   Young to the Utah penitentiary  under the edict of a religious   bigot and wicked man, [b]ecause he felt   his dignity was not honored by   [P]resident Young. On my way to   the place of confinement I remem-  ber what my reflections were. I   thought to myself, "Now, here is   President Young, the man, under   God, who came here, far removed  from civilization, the pioneer of emi-  gration to the great West, and found  a barren, desolate land, inhabited  only by a very poor lot of Indians  and wild animals: to-day it blossoms  comparatively as the rose; and to-day  he is a prisoner on his way to jail."   It worked upon my mind consider-  ably. By and by another spirit said   to me, "Be still, and know that I  am God, and will fight the battles   of this people; you need no[t] allow   yourself to be troubled about this."  The result we all know. That very   act leveled Chief Justice McKean   to the ranks of the common citizen   from which he never rose again, and   he has since passed away, and   like others, is in the hands of God.  Brigham Young will rise in judg-  ment against him and against all  men who have persecuted and ma-  ligned and abused him. That will  be the ca[s]e with all of us—we shall  be called upon to judge this genera-  tion. We should as Saints of God,   never allow ourselves to wish the  destruction of those who oppose or  persecute us, but leave them in the   hands of our God, to deal with them  as he in his justice and mercy may  see fit.    J1175236With regard to the law of God, it   is all right. We can well afford to   keep it and trust in Him. I look   upon it as really marvelous, when   we bear in mind the ceaseless en-  deavors to make themselves notorious  at the expense of those who have   obeyed that law. I say, when I   look upon the results of all that has   been said and done about it,  I regard it as a marvel.   If the hand of God has not been   manifested in behalf of this people;  I do not know where to look for it.   [T]his kingdom will stand, God will  plead with her strong ones, but Zion  will not be moved out of her place.  Quite a remarkable thing has just   happened—four cyclones start from  near the same point, each taking a   different course, the results of which  are known. God has nothing to do   with them, says the world. But  the judgments of God will be poured  out, and the spirit of unbelief will  grow in the hearts of the [p]eople, and   they will be blind to his power until   it is too late.    J1175236 Brethren and sisters, seek after   God; call upon him in your secret  pl[a]ces, and do not turn away from  righteousness and truth; there is  nothing to be gained by doing that,  but everything to lose.    God bless you. Amen.

 HISTORY  OF   WILFORD WOODRUFF.  -[FROM HIS OWN PEN.]-      In tracing the history of my fathers,   I find it difficult to obtain a satis-  factory account of the Woodruff family  for more than three generations.      My great grandfather, Josiah Wood-  ruff, lived nearly one hundred years,  and possessed an iron constitution,  and performed a great amount of   manual labor nearly up to the time of  his death. His wife's name was Sarah;  she bore to him nine children, as   follows: -- Josiah, Appleton, Eldad,  Elisha, Joseph, Rhoda, Phebe, and   two names not given.      My grandfather, Eldad Woodruff,  was the third son of Josiah. He was  born in Farmington, Hartford co.,  Connecticut, in 1751; he also posses-  sed a strong constitution. It was   said that he performed the most labor  for several years of any man in Hart-  ford county, and from over exertion   in hewing timber, he was attacked  with rheumatism in his right hip,  which caused severe lameness for  several years before his death. He  married Dinah Woodford, by whom he   had seven children--viz., Eldad, Eli-  zabeth, Samuel, Aphek, Titus, Helen  and Ozem.      Eldad married Lewey Woodford;  Elizabeth, Amasa Frisby; Samuel,  Miss Case; Aphek, Beulah Thompson  and Azubah Hart; Titus, Louisa  Allen; Helen, Amos Wheeler; and  Ozem, Acksah Merrill and Hannah  Hart; all of whom had large families.  My grandfather died in Farming-  ton, with the spotted fever, in 1806,  aged 55 years. My grandmother,   Dinah, died in 1824, in the same place,  with a cancer in the left breast; her  sufferings were very great.  My father, Aphek Woodruff, was   born in Farmington, Nov. 11, 1778;  he married Beulah Thompson, who   was born in 1782, Nov. 29, 1801.  She bore three sons--namely, Azmon,   born Nov. 29, 1802; Ozen Thompson,  born Dec. 22, 1804; myself born  1807-03-01March 1, 1807.  My mother died with the spotted   fever, June 11, 1808, aged 26 years,  leaving me fifteen months old. My  father's second wife, Azubah Hart,   was born July 31, 1792; they were  married Nov. 9, 1810; they had six  children--viz., Philo, born Nov. 29,  1811, and died by poison administered  by a physician Nov. 25, 1827; Asahel  Hart, born April 11, 1814, and died  in Terrahaute, Oct. 18, 1838; Frank-  lin, born March 12, 1816, and died  June 1; Newton, born June 19, 1818,  drowned Sept. 1820; Julius, born  April 22, 1820, and died in infancy;  Eunice, born June 19, 1821. I   married her to Dwight Webster, in   Farmington, Conn., Aug. 4, 1841.  My father was a strong constitu-  tioned man, and has done a great   amount of labor. At eighteen years   of age he commenced attending a flour- 
 ing and saw mill, and continued about   50 years; most of this time he labored  eighteen hours a day.      He never made any profession of  religion until I baptized him, with all  his household, into the Church of   Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, on   the first day of July 1838. He was a   man of great charity, honesty, inte-  grity and truth, and made himself poor  by giving to the poor, and accomoda-  ting his fellow-men by loaning money  and becoming surety for his neighbors,  and always saying yes to every man  who asked a favor at his hand.      I was born in the north part of the   town of Farmington, now called Avon,   Hartford co., Conn., March 1, 1807.  I assisted my father in attending the   Farmington Mills, until I was twenty  years of age.      In April 1827, I took the flouring   mill of my aunt, Helen Wheeler,   which I attended three years. In   May 1830, I took charge of the flour-  ing mill of Mr. Colllins, the ax manu-  facturer, in South Canton, Conn. At  the end of one year it was demolished  to make way for other machinery.   In March 1831, I took charge of the   flouring mill owned by Mr. Richard   B. Cowles of New Hartford, Conn.   In the spirng of 1832, in company   with my oldeset brother, Azmon, I   went to Richland, Oswego co., New  York, and purchased a farm and saw  mill, and settled in business.

 DISCOURSE  By Elder Wilford Woodruff.  Tabernacle, Sun-  day Afternoon Jan. 10, 1858  ----------  [REPORTED BY J. V. LONG ]  -----------  While I meet with the Saints in this Tabernacle  and partake of the sacrament with them, es-  pecially with such a large body of people as there  are here in these valleys of the mountains, it  leads my mind in a train of reflection and thought   concerning this work in which we are engaged,  and whether I think of it long or short, I have  the same feelings and come to the same con-  clusions, and I say within myself, it is the work of  God, and it is marvellous in my eyes.  There is a marked difference between the work  of God and the work of men, or the work of the   devil, and that difference is manifest in the es-  tablishment of the Church of Jesus Christ of   Latter Day Saints. There is one characteristic  connected with the work of God that has been  manifested in its establishment in these last days  as in all former periods, and that is that whenever  the Lord has attempted to establish his Church   and Kingdom upon the earth he always makes   use of instruments whose peculiar circumstances  in life will naturally lead them to acknowledge   the hand of God in all that is manifested unto   them. You have the example of all the Prophets  from the days of Adam, and as far as we have   any knowledge of them they were nearly all men  of low degree and of humble birth, and the Lord  has ever given them his Spirit to enlighten their   minds, and to qualify them for the work assigned   them. Men of this character have stepped forth  and obeyed the Lord in various ages of the world,  and they have given him the credit for what has   been accomplished. This has been very clearly  manifested in our own day.  Thirty years ago the 22nd day of last September,  the Angel of God delivered unto the hands of   Joseph Smith the plates containing the record  from which the Book of Mormon was translated,   in which is recorded the history of the ancient in-  habitants of this country.  Joseph Smith was a   man of humble birth, and in one sense of the  word he was poor and illiterate, and to look at  things naturally, it looked strange that the Lord  should undertake to build up his Church and  Kingdom with such a feeble instrument. To  some this may look a very small matter, but the  work was great, and here was an honest soul, and  the Lord made choice of that soul to give unto   him the knowledge, the blessings and the glory  associated with the coming forth of the Book of   Mormon which should lay the foundation of    the Church and Kingdom of God in these last days.    What did that angel tell Joseph Smith when  he gave him the plates? The vision of his mind   was opened, and the Angel showed unto him the   condition of the nations of the earth, and said  this record which I now commit unto your hand   contains the words of life, the Gospel of Jesus   Christ, and the Lord is now about to establish his  Kingdom upon the earth. The world are in   darkness, the Gentiles have departed from the  gospel of Jesus Christ; they have forsaken the   light, the glory and the power of the priesthood   of the son of God, which was given to and en-  joyed by the Gentile nations when Israel was   cut off.    The Lord promised Joseph Smith at this early  age that if he would obey his commandments and   hearken to the voice of the Holy Spirit he would   make him an instrument of bringing about this  great work, that the Church may be brought out  of the wilderness of darkness and Error and my  name glorified among men.    The words that this record contains shall be  preached to every kingdom, tongue and people,  and whenever this doctrine is preached your name  shall be had in honorable remembrance among   the virtuous, the holy, the righteous and those   who desire to do good, but the ungodly will vilify   your character, hold up your name to ridicule  and scorn wherever the sound of this gospel goes,   even to all nations.    The Lord also told Joseph Smith, in the com-  mencement of this work, as you will see by the   revelations contained in the Book of Doctrine and   Covenants, that he was laying the foundation of   a great and mighty work and kingdom which  should be the kingdom of God and it should not  be thrown down but stand for ever, but you can-  not now comprehend the extent of it. The mind   of the Prophet was opened by the Spirit of re-  velation, so that he could see and comprehend a  great deal but he required the Spirit of the living   God, the inspiration of the Almighty to rest upon  him continually to qualify him for the great duties  that were constantly increasing upon him, and   the same Spirit is required by any man in this  kingdom, whether he be old or young, rich or  poor to enable him to bring about the work of   God, or to do anything that is of much con-  sequence as the upbuilding of this kingdom.    The Prophet was repeatedly told of the im-  portance of the work in which he was engaged,  and was commanded to obey the voice of God in  all things, and then he was told that all that had  been promised should be fulfilled. The Prophet   saw the chains of darkness that were binding the   souls of men, and although at that time he had   not received the priesthood, yet the Lord mani-  fested himself to him in various ways and at many  times before he was ordained, or before there  were any baptized into the Church. In process  of time, viz. on the 15th day of May, 1829, he and  Oliver Cowdery received the Aaronic Priesthood,   and according to commandment they baptized   each other. Then on the 6th day of April follow-  ing the Church was organized, and the work of   God established on the earth no more to be rooted  out of it.    What must have been the feelings of the   Prophet when, the moment he began to unbosom  his thoughts, and to tell what the Lord had done   for him, the Christian world began to mock and  deride him. The devil opposed him, wicked men  opposed him, and there was a spirit among the  people to kick against the work of God, and there   were whole communities that were opposed to the  doctrine of administration of Angels, and con-  sequently, his path was rugged and thorny.—  Sometimes he would come across individuals who   would listen to his message, and would receive   his testimony. This made his soul rejoice to see  that there were some persons who would receive  the words of eternal life.    True, in the commencement this Church was   small, and I frequently reflect upon what has  come to pass in the world since God spake to  Joseph the Seer; I also look at what has taken   place with this people, and I can clearly see the   fulfilment of the word of God spoken by the   Angel to Joseph before the Church was organized;  the Angel fore told the very scenery that I behold   to-day, and from that time to the present this  people have been fulfilling what the Angel told   the Prophet would come to pass after he gave to  him the plates containing the record of the Book  of Mormon. We are daily working for the fulfil-  ment of those things that were predicted from twen-  ty-five to thirty years ago; these very things that we  are now witnessing both in relation to our friends  and our enemies are in fulfilment of those  promises made in the commencement of this   work.    The Prophet's heart was made glad while he   lived among us in beholding the signs of the   times, and there are many here to-day who re-  member the early days of this Church and King-  dom. Some of the first Elders in this Church who  went up to Kirtland to see the Prophet were made   to rejoice in his society. The Saints who were  gathered together were so few that they might all   have been put in a small schoolhouse, but where-  ver the gospel had been preached some few had   been brought to a knowledge of its truth and  occasionally a few had been gathered up to   Kirtland, perhaps one of a family and two of   a city.    When brother Brigham and br. Jeseph Young   went up to see the Prophet they found him chop-  ping wood for he was a laboring man and gained   his bread by the sweat of his brow, they made   themselves acquainted with him; he received them  gladly, invited them to his house and they rejoiced  together in the gospel of Christ and their hearts   were knitted together in the spirit and bond of   union.    Those of us who gathered to Kirtland in the  early days of the Church can re-  member the scenes which happened in those days.  I well re-  member the time when I first met the Saints   in Kirtland, it was in the spring of 1834. I had    never joined any Church previous to hearing this  gospel, and the first sermon I ever heard was  preached by br. Zera Pulsipher, one of the senior  Presidents of the Seventies, and my heart was   made glad; I embraced the gospel for I knew it   was the first gospel sermon that I had ever heard in  my life. I was baptized by brother Pulsipher,  and shortly afterwards bro. Parley P. Pratt came   along to gather up the warriors of the Lord to go  up and redeem Zion.    I was deeply engaged in business at the time,  but I felt that it was my duty to do all I could  for the cause of truth, and when br. Parley came   up I felt resolved to volunteer. We called a   meeting and when br. Parley got up and said he  was weary with traveling and did not want to say  much, but he would talk a few moments, and   when he got through it was about twelve o'clock   at night; in fact he had preached about half the  night:—my feelings were such, when he got   through, that if all the gold in the world had been  presented to me I could not have been hired to   stay at home. I went with br. Parley through  Jefferson County, to the North, and then im-  mediately prepared to go to Kirtland. I started   to Kirtland on the 11th day of April 1834, and  arrived in Kirtland on the 25th day of the same  month. I then for the first time had an interview  with the Prophet Joseph; he invited me to his  house. I rejoiced to behold his face and to hear   his voice.  I was fully satisfied that Joseph was  a Prophet before I saw him. I had no pre-  judices on my mind against him, but I expected  to see a Prophet.    My first introduction to him was rather singular,  I saw him out in the field with his br. Hyrum;   he had on a very old hat and was engaged shoot-  ing at a mark. I was introduced to him and he  invited me home with him.    I accepted the invitation, and I watched him  pretty closely, to see what I could learn. He re-  marked, while passing to his house, that this was  the first hour he had spent in recreation for a long  time.    Shortly after we arrived at his house he went   into an adjoining room and brought out a wolf-  skin, and said, 'br. Woodruff, I want you to help   me to tan this,' so I pulled off my coat, went to  work and helped him, and felt honored in so doing.   He was about going up with the brethren to re-  deem Zion, and he wanted this wolf's skin to put  upon his wagon seat, as he had no buffalo robe.    This was my first introduction to the Prophet   Joseph Smith, the great Seer of this last dispen-  sation.    I was not there long before I heard him talk  about going to Zion, and it did my soul good to  hear him speak of many things concerning Zion,   the gathering of Israel and the great latter-day   work, and I felt truly satisfied with what I saw   and heard.    I recollect that in the evening after I got there,   several of the brethren came in and talked with   br.  Joseph, and asked what they should do, for  they had not means to bear their expenses from   there to Missouri. Br. Joseph said, 'I am going   to have some money soon,' and the next morning  he received a letter containing a hundred and fifty  dollars, sent to him by sister Voce of Boston; I   don't know but she is in the congregation to-day.    I have felt to rejoice exceedingly in what I saw   of br.  Joseph, for in his public and private career  he carried with him the Spirit of the Almighty,   and he manifested a greatness of soul which I had  never seen in any other man.    The reason I speak of these things is because I   want to refer to this congregation, and to this peo-  ple generally as they have passed along, for truly,   it has required a stretch of faith to be enabled to  comprehend the accomplishment of all that has   been done for the last twenty-five years. The   Lord said by revelation in an early day, 'The har-  vest is ripe, and any man that desires in his heart  to preach the Gospel and will thrust in his sickle,   he is called of God.'    The Elders that are called in this church, you  can notice in them the spirit and disposition to  preach the Gospel and redeem the people from sin,  tradition and error. At the commencement of the  church, the Lord gave revelations to the church   and to individuals, through the Prophet, to  tell them what to do, be baptized, ordained, go on  missions and anything that was required at their   hands, and hence you can see in the Book of   Doctrine and Covenants revelations given to Mar-  tin Harris, Parley P. Pratt, Orson Pratt, the  Whitmers, and many others, calling them to go   forth and preach the Gospel to the world. In   those revelations are promised many great and  glorious things, and the pattern is given and the   foundation laid for a great and mighty work—a   work not to be accomplished in ten, twenty, thir-  ty, forty, nor fifty years, but a work that em-  braces the gathering together of all things which  are to be saved, both in heaven and on earth, and  the establishing of the kingdom of God, to remain  for ever; and the Lord said, you are laying the   foundation for a great and mighty work. But we   did not understand or comprehend its extent.   He called upon us to go forth and warn the world   of the judgments to come, and to call upon them  to learn the ways of righteousness, and to walk  therein, and what has been the result?    Every man that has embraced it, whose heart  was honest before God, has been inspired by   the Spirit of God; he has been ready to engage in  the work, to shoulder their knapsack, and go forth  and preach this gospel to all people whenever an  opportunity presented itself; and the first Elders  of this Church did preach diligently and faith-  fully, and many received the word with gladness  and rejoiced in the truth.    Finally brother Heber C. Kimball was called to go  to England, as you learn by the Church History,  and he laid the foundation of a great work, as the  Angel declared to Joseph should be the case.    The words of life that were engraven upon   those plates have been preached to almost all na-  tions; and have not the people had an opportuni-  ty of hearing? They have in a great degree,   for the servants of the Lord have been inspired to 
 DISCOURSE BY ELDER WILFORD WOODRUFF,    DELIVERED AT THE FORTY-SIXTH ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE CHURCH OF  JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS, IN THE NEW TABERNACLE, SALT  LAKE CITY, THURSDAY MORNING, APRIL, 6, 1876.    (Reported by David W. Evans.)    INFIDELITY OF THE CHRISTIAN WORLD—DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES  OF THE SAINTS—NECESSITY OF A TEMPLE, AND WORKS IN BEHALF  OF THE DEAD.    "Who am I, saith the Lord, that   I command and am not obeyed?   Who am I, saith the Lord, that I   promise and do not fulfill?" We   have again the privilege of assembling   ourselves together upon another An-  nual Conference of the Church of  Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,   and I hope and trust that, what time   we may spend in Conference, our   hearts may be lifted up unto the   Lord, that his Holy Spirit may be   given unto us, that we may be   dictated and directed in our words,   thoughts, acts, and teachings, in such   a manner that we may be justified   before him.    We have said, time after time,   and year after year, that we live in a   very peculiar age, generation and   dispensation, and this is true. Time   rolls on, carrying with it its events,   and fulfilling the revelations of God,   unto us especially. We live in a   day of darkness; unbelief and infi-  delity are covering the whole face of   the earth, until it seems as though   the whole Christian world had lost   all hold of faith in God and in his   Son Jesus Christ, and in the Bible, 
 DISCOURSE  BY  ELDER WILFORD WOODRUFF,  Delivered at the Annual Conference  Saturday a.m., April 6, 1878.    REPORTED BY GEO F. GIBBS.    THE very fact that we have a peo-  ple, that we have a Zion, that we have a   kingdom, that we have a  church and a priesthood which is   connected with the heavens, and  which has power to move the hea-  vens, and that we know that the  heavens are communicating with  us, directing the performance of  this great latter-day work in which  the Latter-day Saints are engaged,  this very fact alone should fill our   hearts with humility before the   Lord our God, and it should con-  tinually remind us in our reflec-  tions and feelings of the responsi-  bility we are under both to Him  and to one another, and also of our  dependence upon him for all the  blessings we enjoy of a spiritual as   well as a temporal nature.    The prayer offered up by Brother   Pratt filled my mind with reflec-  tions of the past. Almost half a  century has expired since the   Prophet of God organized this  church upon the earth; but he and  most of the men who labored pro-  minently with him, in laying the   foundation of this church, are not  with us to-day, their voices are   hushed in death, they have finish-  ed their earthly work, having la-  bored a series of years, and are now  the other side of the vail. There   are but two of the first quorum of   the Twelve with us in the flesh,   and only two of the second quo-  rum. And this speaks in loud and  forcible language, at least it does  to me, that what we have to do in  the interest of the great cause of   salvation, we should perform it  faithfully and diligently, making   the very best use of the few re-  maining days we have yet to la-  bor in the flesh.    While I refer to the absence of   our brethren whose works remain  and whose memories are cherished,  I am fully conscious this morning  that we who are left are not labor-  ing alone, nor particularly for our   own benefit, in a temporal point of   view; but I realize that we are call-  ed and ordained of God to labor  with him and the heavenly hosts,  in the accomplishment of his pur-  poses, the bringing forth and estab-  lishing of his Zion and Kingdom in  the earth, and all that has been de-  signed to be consummated in this   the dispensation of the fullness of   times. I also sense that when I   and my brethren who still remain  shall pass away, we shall go as   others have done—we shall not  take this world or any part of it   with us.  When Joseph Smith died,  Nauvoo remained, he did not take  it with him; when President Brig-  ham Young died, Salt Lake City   still remained, and when we join   them we shall leave behind us the  things of time, even as Jesus did  himself who was the founder of the   earth. This truth itself should in-  cite the Latter-day Saints to reflec-  tion, it should indelibly impress   upon our memories the fact that  we are working for something far  greater, in real worth, than dollars  and cents, houses and lands and   this world's goods. We have been  gathered here in our present condi-  tion by the commandment and by   the inspiration of the Lord, to con-  tinue the work that others com-  menced, and like them we must   improve the time in doing what   is required of us, working faithful  ly for God and his Kingdom while   the day lasts.    I know, you know, and all Israel  knows who have received the ful-  ness of the everlasting gospel in  this last dispensation of God to  man, that this is the work of God   and not of man; we understand  this perfectly. This church and   kingdom has been organized by the  administration of angels from God.  The organization of this church  has been governed and controlled  by revelation and upon no other  principle, and what has already   been accomplished since our exist-  ence, as a church, reveals the han-  diwork of God, for no man could   have done what has been done un-  less God were with him. I rejoice   to have the privilege of meeting  with so many of my brethren and  sisters, and that I have the privi-  lege of bearing testimony to the  divinity of this latter-day work,  and of the principles of salvation   revealed from God to man.  The   scene I behold this morning, and   that which I behold in traveling  through the extent of this Terri-  tory, speaks to me in very loud  language that it is in fulfilment of   the designs of God, and the revela-  tions of Jesus Christ, which are re-  corded not only in the Bible, or on   the stick of Judah, but also in the   Book of Mormon, or stick of Joseph  in the hands of Ephraim, as well  as in the New Testament, and   those revelations of modern date as  those of ancient time, have been   sealed with the blood of him who   brought them forth, and this tes-  tament therefore is in force to all  the world. The Lord is not trifling   with this generation, neither is he   trifling with the Saints or with the   world of mankind. During the   last 48 years the Gospel has been  preached to this generation, and this   work will continue preaching to   the Gentiles, until the Lord directs  otherwise. The harvest is ripe,   and he, the Lord, said, through the   Prophet Joseph, he that would   thrust in the sickle and reap was  called of God. And some have   continued to labor faithfully almost  from the organization of this Church  to the present time—almost half a   century.  I think it a great bles-  sing and privilege to stand in the   midst of the people of God in this   age of the world to preach the gos-  pel of Jesus, and to labor to build   up Zion, in obedience to his com-  mandments, and to carry out his   purposes in the day and age in  which I live: We, as a whole peo-  ple, should certainly exercise our   faith in God and in the revelations,   more especially those that immedi-  ately refer to our present condition;   no matter where they are found,  in any of the records of divine truth.  The Lord has said unto us, through   Joseph Smith, that it matters not  whether he speaks unto the chil-  dren of men by his own voice or by  the ministrations of angels, or whe-  ther by the voice of his servants,   that it is all the same, it is his   word, his mind and his will to   those to whomsoever it comes; and   that although the heavens and the   earth pass away, not one jot or  tittle of his word shall remain un-  fulfilled.    I am a believer in this revelation  and also in the records which are  left for us to pursue, the inspired   words of ancient as well as modern  prophets; and I also believe that   they will have their fulfilment in   the due time of the Lord, and that   no power on earth can prevent it.   And I do not believe there has been   a revelation given from God to   man, from the days of father Adam   to this hour, but what has had its   fulfilment, or will have, as fast as  time will admit; and we are every  day of our lives making history,  and we are also fulfiling the pro-  phecies of Isaiah and many other   ancient men of God, who were per-  mitted in vision to see our day.    I know we live in a day of infidel-  ity; I know that darkness covers  the earth and gross darkness the  minds of the people; I know that   the Lord is angry with the wicked,   and withholding his spirit from the   inhabitants of the earth; I know   that light has come into the world,   and that men love darkness rather  than light, because their deeds are   evil. But as a servant of the living   God I will say that, notwith-  standing all the unbelief of this   wicked generation—the Christian,   the Jewish and the pagan world,   together with the combined efforts   of the devil and wicked men, the  fulfilment of the purposes of God  in their times and seasons cannot be   frustrated. These volumes of reve-  lation are written on the pages of   divine truth as in letters of fire,   and they will have their fulfilment   whether men believe or disbelieve,   for they are the words of God.    It is a great work, an almighty   work; it is a work different from  that of any dispensation which  God has given to man. When I  look upon these Latter-day Saints  I cannot help contemplating   our calling and the labor re-  quired at our hands, and, when   I am reminded of the account   that we have all got to give before   the judgment seat of God for the  use we make of our own time and  talents, and the gifts of God and   the holy priesthood, and the work  of our God which has been com-  mitted to us, I feel to ask, What   manner of men ought we to be.   Our souls should be open to the  building up of this kingdom of God,   and we should continue with   increased diligence to rear towards  heaven these temples of our God,   the foundation of which we have   laid and commenced to build upon,   so that all Israel who dwell here  may enter into them and attend to  the ordinances of the house of God.  And I again say to the Latter-day   Saints, this work the God of Israel  requires at your hands. This re-  quirement is not confined to the   Twelve, the President of Stakes   and the Bishops, but it is binding   upon every man who has entered   into covenant with the Lord our  God, and I trust that one and all   will willingly share this responsi-  bility, and not for a moment per-  mit this work to drag or appear la-  borious to perform.    I thank the Lord my God that   my ears have been saluted with   the sound of the Gospel, and that I   have had the privilege of reading  the revelations of God to us, and I   know that, as an individual, I am   held responsible for my duty to   Him. We have a harvest to reap  both sides of the vail. We have   already done considerable work on  this side, by way of preaching the  Gospel to the nations of the earth,  as commanded to do by God. Well  do I remember the early experience  of the first Elders of the Church,   how we traveled afoot for thou-  sands of miles, without purse or   scrip, with valise in hand, and   many times having to beg our  bread, from door to door, in   order to impart to the  people a knowledge of the Gospel.    Our garments are clear from the  blood of this generation, and the   testimony of these elders will yet  rise in judgment against this gen-  ration to condemn them.  Not-  withstanding the unbelief of the   Christian world, and notwithstand-  ng the warfare that may be waged  against God and his Christ, Zion   will be redeemed and his kingdom   will be established never more to be   thrown down. He holds the nations  in his own hands, and he also has   his Saints in his holy keeping, and   he will continue to guide and direct   and sustain his people, until they   consummate all unto which they  have been ordained.    Look at these valleys! When   we came here in 1847, they were bar-  en and desolate, without the least   sign or mark of civilization. To-  day our Territory is filled with vil-  lages, towns and orchards, and the   land is brought under a good state  of cultivation, inhabited by a civil-  ized race. Who are they? Sons   and daughters of the Lord Almigh-  ty; they are a people that have been,  as corn sifted in a sieve, among   the Gentile nations, and called out  by the proclamation of the ever-  lasting Gospel. The Lord chose  a boy from the humble walks of   life, and endowed him with intelli-  gence and power to commence this  great work, and also to send forth   others throughout this and to other  nations bearing the messages of life,   and this people opened their hearts  to receive it, and were baptized in   water for remission of sins, and re-  ceived the laying on of hands for  the reception of the Holy Ghost.   They have been born of the Spirit,   and they have seen the kingdom of   God, and they have received ordin-  ation in order to enter into it. And   when they enter into it, they have   the spirit of it, and this makes the  difference between the Latter-day  Saints and the former-day Saints.   No man can see the kingdom of God  unless he is born of the Spirit; and  this is wherein these Latter-day   Saints have faith in God, and ob-  serve the signs of the times, and   trust in him by this principle.   Their prayers have ascended in the   ears of the Lord of Sabbaoth, asking   for things which they stood in need   of; and he has answered our pray-  ers and he has continued to sustain  us until the present time.  I ask,   my brethren and sisters, will the  Lord withhold now his hand, will   he now close the heavens, with-  drawing the power by which we   have been upheld? No, he will   not; his hand will continue over us  if we be true to him and the laws  he has given unto us. He has de-  creed before the foundation of this  world, before the fall of man, that   in the dispensation of the fulness   of times, he would gather unto   himself all things, both things  which are in heaven and things on   the earth. He is doing it, although   the world generally does not know   it.    Now, brethren and sisters, I do  not wish myself to occupy all your  time this morning, but I want to   say to you that our position, our   calling, our religon embrace the  noble work of God, both temporal  and spiritual, which rests upon us.  We have to go forth with our hands  and build up Zion. Zion will be   built up; Zion will be redeemed,  and she will arise and shine and   put on bet beautiful garments; she   will break from off her neck her   yoke, and she will be clothed with  the glory of our God. Zion has  been sold for naught; she will be  redeemed without money; she will  arise in her beauty and glory, as   the prophets of God have seen her;  she will extend her borders and   strengthen her stakes, and the God  of heaven will comfort her, inas-  much as we will unite together to   carry out his purposes.    I see nothing to tempt me or you  to turn aside from the work given   us to do. The prophets have pre-  dicted that every weapon that is   formed against Zion shall be brok-  en, and this is in accordance with  the revelations of God to us. He   will continue this work and direct  its onward course, but he expects   us to continue to reclaim the   waste places, and to con-  tinue to build temples and  also to impart of our substance.   And I wish all Israel to understand  that when we impart of our sub-  stance to build temples that we do   not do it to benefit the Lord at all,   he had his endowments a long   time before we were born, and also  passed through his probation. We  are his children, he wishes to exalt   us back to his presence, and he   knows very well we are obliged to   walk in the same path and receive   the same ordinances in order to  inherit the same glory that sur-  rounds him. And when we erect  temples in which to perform ordi-  ances for the living and the dead,   we do it to benefit our own blessed  selves. I want salvation, I wish to  inherit eternal life, I wish to get   back to the presence of God from  whence I came, when I have fin-  ished my probation in the flesh.   And I believe that I desire nothing  in this respect but what you also   wish. Then I know that it re  quires my diligence and my con-  tant labor and study, the little  time I have to spend in the flesh, to  do all I can to build up Zion and   to establish the church and the   kingdom of God upon the earth.   If we can only obtain eternal   lives we shall attain to the greatest  of God's gifts to man.  Our Savior,  our Heavenly Father, the angel  Gabriel, Peter, James and John,   Joseph Smith and Brigham Young,  are not coming back to build our  temples for us, they are not com-  ing to settle new country and open  up new roads, plant out our trees,   build up and beautify this land,   this is our part of the work, and   we have got it to do, working while  we live, and when we go away we   shall move on exactly as others   have done, leaving our houses our   gardens, our flocks and herds, and  all our earthly interests behind us.   And when we go to the spirit   world and our eyes are opened on  eternal lives, we shall all marvel at  the way in which our lives have  been spent. There is a vail over  all the earth, it is ordained of God   that it should be so, and the fact of  it being so will prove all of his   children whether we will abide in  his covenant even unto death or   not. And those who are not wil-  ling to abide in their covenant unto  the end for the building up of the  kingdom of God, are not worthy of   a place with God and with the   Savior and those who bare sealed  their testimony with their blood.    I pray the Lord to bless you and   all those who may attend this Con-  ference, and also the brethren who   may address you; and trust that   our prayers may continually ascend   into the ears of the Lord on behalf   of Zion and her speedy redemption.    I will say before closing, that I  have just returned from St. George,  where I have been laboring in the  Temple. The work of God con-  tinues there; as a general thing we  have as much labor as the Temple  is capable of sustaining. The spirit  of the work does not lag. And I  can safely add that just as quick as   the people get the Temple done at  this place, the way will be opened   before them, they will feel the re-  sponsibility of attending to the  work so essentially necessary to be  done on behalf of those who have  lived and passed away without   having had the privilege of receiv-  ing the blessings of the Gospel; and   as their time and attention will be  occupied in this direction will they   perceive the importance as well as  the magnitude of the work. There   are many to-day who stand in need  of this assistance, and as I have   often said, so say I again to this   body of Latter-day Saints, that this  labor devolves upon us, and God   requires it at our hands. The Pro-  phet Joseph may turn the keys in   the spirit world, and he and those   engaged with him may preach to  the spirits in prison, but they can   not baptize them nor confirm them  nor administer offices of the endow-  ment. Some person or persons  dwelling in the flesh must attend  to this part of the work for them;  for it takes just as much to save a  dead man who never received the   Gospel as a living man. And all   those who have passed away with-  out the Gospel have the right to   expect somebody in the flesh to   perform this work for them. Amen. 
 DISCOURSE  BY  ELDER WILFORD WOODRUFF,  Delivered at the Tabernacle, Salt  Lake City, Sunday, June 30, 1878.    REPORTED BY GEO. F. GIBBS.    There is a principle that I feel   disposed to say a few words on, in   connection with what brother Rich  has been saying, and that is the  principle of faith.    [The speaker then read the ##Hebrews 11|11th  chapter## of Hebrews.]    I have taken the liberty of read-  ing this catalogue of blessings   which ancient men of God obtained  through the principle of faith;   which principle is as much needed  to-day by the people of this genera  tion, as by any people at any age of  the world. We might continue the   chapter of results and operations   of the principle of faith to the   present day. For by faith Joseph  Smith received the ministration of  God, out of heaven. By faith he   received the records of Nephi, and   translated them through the Urim   and Thummim, into our own  language; and which have since  been translated into many different  languages. By faith he made the  foundation of this church and  kingdom, just as much as Noah,  by faith, built the ark, and received   the fulness thereof. [##Hebrews 11:7##] By faith he   prophesied, leaving a record, a tes-  tament which has been given  through his mouth to the inhabit-  ants of the earth, and which con-  tains the revelations of God yet to be  fulfilled. The testator is dead, but   his testament is in force to all the   world. By faith the elders of this   church left their homes and fami-  lies, and went, when called upon, to   foreign nations without money and   without learning or experience, to   preach the Gospel of the Kingdom   without price, to this generation,  and warning the inhabitants of the  earth of the judgments of God   which await the world, and which  must overtake the wicked. Faith   is necessary on the part of the   Latter-day Saints, say nothing   about the outside world, in order   to read and believe the records of   divine truth which have come unto  us; and it requires faith on the part  of the Christian world to really be-  lieve this record, the Bible—to be-  lieve that the Lord, through his   servants, really means what he  says, and says what he means. It  requires faith on the part of the  Latter-day Saints to perform their  duties acceptably before God; for   we, in this dispensation, must walk  by faith and not by sight, just as   much as the people of God in any   previous dispensation. And this  principle we should exercise and  live by. Some of the revelations   which God has given unto us point  to the future condition of the world,   and foretell what must shortly be-  fall the world of mankind. These   predictions were uttered by holy   men as they were moved upon by   the Holy Ghost; and although the  men themselves have passed away,   not one jot or title of their words   will fail in their fulfillment. Not  withstanding all the unbelief and   infidelity of the modern world,   there is not a man living that can   place his finger upon the first reve  lation of God to man, from the days   of father Adam to the present time,  but what has had or is having its  fulfillment as fast as time and op-  portunity admit of. God lives.   These revelations which have been  given through men who were in-  spired of the Holy Ghost, will have   their fulfilment, even if the results   should effect the destruction of the  generation now living. When   Jesus brought the Gospel to his   father's house—the Jews, they re-  jected him and the words of life he   taught them. He found them  intently looking forward to the  coming of their Shiloh in the per-  son of a king, a ruler who should  possess great power, even power  sufficient to deliver them from  Romish yoke. They never once   dreamed that he would appear in  their midst as the babe of Beth-  lehem, who should be born in a  stable, and cradled in a manger, a   man who should know sorrow, and   who should be acquainted with grief,   and who should choose as his   disciples illiterate fishermen of low  degree. [##Isaiah 53:3##] And although he was   their Savior King who would have  redeemed them, and delivered them,   and given unto them the gospel of  peace and of liberty, yet they in   their vanity and pride despised  him, and persecuted him, and at   last shed his blood. [##Matthew 27##] But was there a  word ever uttered by him concern-  ing their temple or nation but what   met with i[t]s fu[l]filment to the very   letter? The history of the Jews,   which chronicles the days of their   glory and power, when they held   the Urim and Thummim, the  ephod, the priesthood, and when  [t]hey offered sacrifice, taken in con-  nection with the prediction of Jesus   foretelling their downfall and dis-  persion, is of itself sufficient to teach  every infidel mind, that there is   truth in the revelations of God to  man. The Jews have been tram-  pled under the feet of the Gentiles   for the last 1,800 years, fulfilling, too,   what Moses said of them; and they  have been overthrown as a nation,   and led captive unto other nations,  and are held in scorn by the Gen  tiles even to the present hour.   And you may begin at the begi-  ning, taking, for instance, those  great cities that figured anciently   in their splendor and magnificence,   and which were built to defy all   time, such as Nineveh, Thebes,  Tyre and Sidon, Memphis and   Babylon. Where are they, and   what become of them? They are  gone, their history buried as it  were, in oblivion, and that too in  fulfillment of prophesy. Yes, the   words of some poor honest prophet   or apostle raised up to declare the   Gospel to the inhabitants thereof,   but whom they despised and reject  ed, have met with their fulfilment,  and the disobedient and wicked   have passed away to be judged ac  cording to the deeds done in the   body. And you may trace the his-  tory of the world from father Adam   to the present time, and I can defy  any man to point to a single pre-  diction, uttered by inspired men  raised up of God, but what has or  will come to pass in its time and   season. And if the Gentiles to-day   would read these revelations of   God, and exercise faith in them,  they would no longer wonder when   they come among us, to see these  valleys, for 600 miles, filled with  cities and towns, gardens and or-  chards, temples and tabernacles,  and with comfortable dwellings.  But the fact is, unbelief has over-  whelmed the Christian world, and  man has spiritualized the Scriptures   until there is no faith in him, and   he has no faith in God, nor in the  literal fulfilment of his revelations   to man. That is what ails the   world to-day. The predictions of   the Bible never would have been  fulfilled, had not the Lord, in these  last days raised, up a prophet as an  instrument in his hands to again   establish his Gospel on the earth,   and gather together the house of  Israel to the valleys of these ever-  lasting hills, according to his de-  cree to old father Jacob; and his  seed have yet to make this western  desert to blossom as the rose, bring-  ing forth "the fir tree, the pine  tree, and the box together, to beau-  tify the place of my sanctuary." [##Isaiah 60:13##]  The whole history of this people  has beeen foretold by the prophet   Isaiah, thousands of years ago; and  it has been a steady growth from   the commencement to the present.   And will the Lord stop here? No;   whether men believe or not, this   Zion so often spoken of in holy   writ, has got to arise and put on  her beautiful garments; these   mountain vales have got to be  filled with the saints of God, and   temples reared to his holy name,   preparatory to the time when "the   Gentiles shall come thy light,   and kings to the brightness of thy  rising." [##Isaiah 60:3##] And this time will come  when the nations are fully warned  by the preaching of the servants of  God, and his judgments commence   to be poured out upon the world,  in fulfilment of the revelations of   St. John. Faith then is what the   unbelieving world needs to exercise  in God, and in his revelations to  man; but as I have said, whether  we do it or not, our unbelief will  never turn the hand of God to the  right or the left.    God has restored again his Gos-  pel. He has raised up men and  commanded them to go forth and  preach it to the world, and they   have been engaged doing so now  for nearly half a century, ever  since the organization of this  Church. It was organized by reve  lation, with prophets apostles, pas-  tors, teachers, helps and govern-  ment, and the principles of it were  taught by revelation, the same as   Jesus and the Apostles taught them  in their day; and they are the same  as when they taught them, there is  there is no change whatever. The Lord   never revealed but one Gospel to  the inhabitants of th[e] earth,  in any age of the world, nor   never will; the Gospel is the   same yesterday, to-day, and forev-  er, and the principles thereof are  faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, be-  lieving that he is, and that he lived   and died as a ransom for the sins of   the world; and baptism for the re-  mission of sins, being immersed  and buried in water, by one having  authority of God, that you may rise  in newness of life, in fulfilment of   the testimony of Jesus, and then  receive the Holy Ghost by the lay-  ing on of hands, confirming be-  lievers members of his Church. [##Hebrews 13:8##]  And when you are born of the wa-  ter and the Spirit, you can enter in  to the Kingdom of God, and being   born of the Spirit, you can see the  Kingdom of God. And such be-  lievers, when they receive the   Holy Ghost receive the inspira  tion and revelation and light of   it. Our eyes and ears may be de-  ceived by the cunning and machi-  nation of man; but the Holy Ghost   never deceives anybody. It bears  record of the Father and the Son,  and it bears record of the truths of   the Gospel to those who possess it.   The Lord never had a church on   the face of the earth, from it first   organization until to day, unless   that church was organized by revel-  ation, with prophets and apostles,   pastors, teachers, helps and govern-  ments endowed with the Holy   Priesthood—that power delegated  from God to man, which authorizes  him to act for God; and without  this Priesthood no man, from the  day the world rolled into existence   has any right to administer in any  of the ordinances of his holy house  neither has any man a right to that   Priesthood save he be called of God  as was Aaron who, we are informed,   was called by revelation. [##Hebrews 5:4##] What is  his Priesthood for? It is to ad-  minister the ordinances of the Gos-  pel, even the Gospel of our Father  in heaven, the eternal God, the   Eloheim of the Jews and the God   of the Gentiles, and all he has ever   done from the beginning has been  performed by and through the   power of that Priesthood, which is  "Without father, without mother,   without descent, having neither be-  ginning of days, nor end of life," [##Hebrews 7:3##]  and the administration of his ser-  vants holding this priesthood is  binding, being the savor of life un-  to life or death unto death. It was  by virtue of this priesthood the  twelve apostles anciently went in-  to the world to preach the Gospel,   and it was because of this priest-  hood which they held that men, in   rejecting then, rejected Him who  sent them and consequently   brought upon themselves condemn-  ation. Light has again come into   the world; but men love darkness   rather than light because their deeds  are evil. [##John 3:17-19##] Hence condemnation  rests down upon the world, for the  consequences of rejecting the Gospel  must overtake the world in this the   last dispensation, just as much as  they did in former ones, in the days  Noah and Lot and those of the  Savior.    As I before stated, so say I again,   the Gospel of Christ requires faith  all the day long, for no man can   continue faithful to the end with-  out it. God has set his hand a sec  ond time to build up that kingdom   which Daniel was permitted to see   in vision, and to establish that Zion  in the mountains which Isaiah saw. [##Daniel 2:26-47##] [##Isaiah 60##]  He has set his hand, for the last  time, to gather together all things   which are in heaven and on earth  which are in Christ, unto himself. [##Ephesians 1:10##]  The day has come when the Lord   has sent forth a proclamation to  warn the nations to prepare for his   second coming; and the signs of  both heaven and earth all indicate   the coming of the Son of Man,   which is near at the door. No man   knows the day or the hour when   Christ will come, but the genera-  tion is clearly pointed out, the fig  tree is leaving, and great changes   are near at hand.  [##Matthew 24:32-36##] Great Babylon is  coming in remembrance before God,  and the Lord has called upon the  inhabitants of the earth, who are   very wicked, to repent of their sins   an[d] turn unto him. The genera-  tion in which we live is a wicked   and an adulterous generation, and  wickedness and abomination of ev-  ery kind are increasing, and the  earth has commenced to groan un-  der the evil practices of man. The  heavens are in pain over the diso-  bedience and unrighteousness of   the children of men, and the an-  gels, we are told, are waiting in   their places in the Temple for the   time to come when they will be  called upon to go forth and reap   down the earth. Judgments await   the world, but they heed not, and  apparently do not care. With fire   and sword the Lord will plead with   all flesh, and as the prophet has   said respecting this event, "the  slain of the Lord will be many;"  and these things will overtake the  world in an hour when they expect   them not, when they will be cry-  ing peace, but alas, peace will have   departed from them, and they left to  devour and destroy each other. [##Isaiah 66:16##] All  these things are foretold and many   of them are written in these revela  tions given in our day, and they   are already being fulfilled before   our eyes; and they will continue to   be fulfilled, until all that is spoken   of shall have come to pass. There-  fore, I want to say to the Latter-day  Saints; Exercise faith in God, and  exercise faith in his revelations, and   read them and ponder over them  and pray earnestly that you may   have a correct understanding of all   that God has revealed, that you   may grow in the light and knowl  edge of God, and see the import-  ance of living your religion and of  living uprightly before Him; for   all men, both Jew and Gentile,   saint and sinner, will be judged ac-  cording to the deeds done in the  body, and for the opportunities  which we have of informing our  selves of the will of God concern  ing us, which we allow to go unim-  proved, we cannot be held guiltless.  It certainly becomes us, who have  named the name of Christ, to walk   uprightly before God, for we can  not escape his chastening hand if   we reject the light we have receiv-  ed. Our condemnation will be  far greater than those who never  embraced the principles of the Gos  pel, if we apostatize, or through in-  different carelessness we allow the   cares and things of this world to   choke down the good seed planted.  We have "tasted the good word of  God, and the powers of the world   to come;" we "know the Master's   will," and if we do it not we will   be "beaten with many stripes." [##Hebrews 6:5##] [##Luke 12:47##]  The religious world talk about non-  essentials. There are no such things   existing in the Gospel of the Lord   Jesus. He requires us to obey the  same laws that he himself obeyed,   and which he taught in his day.   Why did he go into the Jordan to   be baptized of John? To fulfill all  righteousness. [##Matthew 3:13-17##] It was a righteous  law, it belonged to him, and his   example is in force to all the world.  No man can enter into the King-  dom of God except he is born of  the water and of the Spirit. [##John 3:5##] Men may  be judged and their bodies lie in the  grave until the last resurrection, to   come forth and receive of a telestial   glory; but no man will receive of   of the celestial glory except it be  through the ordinances of the House   of God. Jesus performed that act   that he might set the example; he   was the way for others to follow.  The Jews, as I have said, rejected   him and the Gospel he brought to   them, and they shed his blood.   They have been paying the penalty   of their misdeeds for the last 1800   years. It costs something to shed  innocent blood, it costs something   to shed the blood of prophets and  apostles. And I have sometimes   taken the liberty, before strangers as   well as Latter-day Saints, to express  my views in regard to shedding the  blood of Joseph Smith and other   prophets. It has cost this nation   four years' war, laying in the dust  nearly a million and a half of men,  and it has also cost millions upon  millions of dollars, creating a debt   which it will never live to pay.   This is the faith of Wilford Wood-  ruff, and I think I have a right to   exercise my faith in this matter. I   say then, it costs something to shed  the [b]lood of righteous men in this  as well as in previous generations.  My testimony is that judgments   await Babylon, judgments await   the Christian world, and if people   will read their Bible, they will see   these declarations written down,   and these judgments will increase   until the world is cleansed from   wickedness. And I say to all the   world, Repent of your sins, and be   baptized for the remission of them, that   you may receive the Holy Ghost by   the laying on of hands, and be  saved in the Kingdom of God.   Without complying with these re-  quirements, you nor I can never go  where God and Christ dwell, worlds  without end, for these things have  been made known to us by ancient   and modern prophets.    Therefore, your as well as my   eternal destiny, our future position  throughout the ages of eternity, de-  pend upon the few hours, the few  days, the few weeks we spend in   the flesh. If I ever obtain a full  salvation it will be by my keeping   the laws of God. If I sin against God   and man, I shall have to foot the  bill; it will be so with you and with   the whole world. This is the Gos-  pel of Jesus Christ; this is the Zion   of God, and what you see already   accomplished in this desert land is   really in fulfilment of the revela-  tions of God. The hand of God   has guided this Church from its in-  cipiency to the present time. God   will continue to direct its affairs,  and there is no power on the earth   or under the earth that can ever   stop its progress, for He, himself,  has decreed that the Zion of the  latter-days shall never be over-  thrown; but on the contrary, as he  has said, through the mouth of the   prophet Isaiah, "For the nation and   the kingdom that will not serve   thee shall perish; yea, those nations   shall be utterly wasted." [##Isaiah 60:12##] Pretty   strong doctrine to be taught by a   humble man of God. Neverthe-  less, time will bring it about and it   is not in the power of man to pre-  vent it. I am a believer in revela-  tion. I am a believer, from the  crown of my head to the soles of   my feet, with every particle of spir-  it in me, that God will bring about,   literally and to the very letter, all   that he has spoken through his ser-  vants, ancient and modern.    By way of concluding my re-  marks I wish to bear testimony to  this congregation and to the stran-  gers present, that Joseph Smith was  a prophet of the living God; he was  raised up by the Lord, and laid the  foundation of this Church. He  lived to accomplish the work he   was raised up to do. He received   the keys of the Priesthood from un-  der the hands of Peter, James and   John, and those pertaining to the  gathering of scattered Israel, from   under the hands of Moses, the lead-  er of ancient Israel. [##Doctrine and Covenants 27:12##] Elijah, or   Elias also visited him and bestowed   upon him the keys to "turn the   hearts of the fathers to the children,  and the heart of the children to the   fathers," which was in fulfilment   of a prediction by the Prophet Mal-  achi. [##Malachi 4:6##] He also received the keys of  the Aaronic Priesthood under the   hands of John the Baptist, which  Priesthood pertains to the temporal   government of the Church. After  performing his work he sealed his   testimony with his blood, passed  behind the vail, and he with his  brethren who have also gone, is still  engaged in carrying on the same   great work. He still labors by vir-  tue of this priesthood which he re-  ceived on earth, and which he will   continue to hold, worlds without   end. And this will be the case   with every faithful man of God  who magnifies his calling and   priesthood here below.    May God bless you, my brethren   and sisters and friends, with his   Holy Spirit, and give you faith in   Him, and in his revelations, that  you may be led to do his will while  you live upon the earth. But  whether you live to be thus favored  or not, my testimony is that they   will have their fulfilment. Even   so, amen. 
 DISCOURSE   BY  APOSTLE WILFORD WOODRUFF,  At Nephi, Saturday Afternoon,  Jan. 27, 1883.    REPORTED BY GEO. F. GIBBS.    WE meet with the Saints of the   several Stakes at the Stake Quarter-  ly Conferences for the purpose of   giving instruction which all need  in order to qualify themselves to   magnify their calling as Saints of   God, engaged in establishing and  building up the Church and King-  dom of God. And I will here say,   as I have often said, that all men,   and all women, regardless of the   position they occupy, or the office  they hold, are dependent upon the  Lord for His Spirit to assist them in  their labors.    I made a covenant with the Lord,   years ago, that whatever He would  impress me to say, I would preach   to the people. If we are not able to  speak to your edification, it is not   because there are not truth and   knowledge, principles and laws suf-  ficient within the pale of this   Church, and connected with the   work in which we are engaged. I   look upon the cause of God and the   mission that He has given each of  us connected with it, as requiring  the whole attention, the might,  mind and strength of each one of   us, in order to magnify our calling   and accomplish the work committed  to our hands.    The Lord raised up Joseph Smith  specially to do the work that he per-  formed. He was ordained and ap-  pointed before he was born to come  upon the stage of action in this age   of God's mercy to man, through  the loins of ancient Joseph who was   a descendant of Abraham, Isaac   and Jacob, to lay the foundation of   this great and glorious dispen-  sation—a dispensation that   will be marked and distin-  guished in the annals of human  history for its grand and mighty,   as also its serious and awful events.  The day has already dawned when   the light of heaven is to fill the   earth; the day in which the Lord   has said that nothing should be kept  hidden, whether it be things per-  taining to one God, or many Gods,   or to thrones, principalities or pow-  ers; the day in which everything  that has been kept from the know-  ledge of man ever since the founda-  tion of the earth, must be revealed;   and it is a day in which the ancient  prophets looked forward to with a  great deal of interest and anxiety.  It is a day in which the Gospel is to   be preached to every nation, tongue  and people for a witness of what   shall follow; a day in which the Is-  rael of God who receive it in their  dispersed and scattered condition  are to gather together to the place  appointed of God, the place where  they will perform the "marvelous  work and a wonder" spoken of by   the ancients who, in vision, saw our   day; and where they will begin to   inherit the promises made to the  fathers respecting their children.   The work that is to be so marvelous  in the eyes of men has already com-  menced, and is assuming shape and   proportions; but they cannot see it.  It will consist in preaching the Gos-  pel to all the world, gathering the  Saints from the midst of all those   nations who reject it; building up   the Zion of God; establishing per-  manently in the earth His king-  dom; preparing for the work of   the gathering of the Jews and the   events that will follow their settle-  ment in their own lands, and in   preparing for ourselves holy places  in which to stand when   the judgments of God shall  overtake the nations. This is truly  a good work; and it is a marvel  (when we look at it with our   naturral eyes) how this people are   sustained in their faith and hope of   accomplishing it, besides having to  provide for the wants of themselves   and families, which is of itself as  much as most men can accomplish.  We cannot do the work which God   through us intends to have done,  unless we place ourselves under His  care and direction, and take the sen-  timent, "The Kingdom of God, or   nothing," for our motto, as well as  the end and aim of our life. This  we must do to be truly the servants   of God. We cannot serve God and   mamon. We cannot build up the  Kingdom of God and withhold our   hearts from Him. We must either   come under the dominion of God  and be led and directed by Him, or   under the dominion of Satan, and  [b]e ruled over by him. It is for us,   through our faith and works, our   desires and course of life, to choose   which we will take, as we must   take the one side or the other.    Nobody in this world has cause to   rejoice as we have. None have the   encouraging future before them that   we have; for Zion is not to be  moved out of her place, neither is  "the kingdom" to be given to an-  other people. God rules and reigns,   and we are His people, and He is   our God.    This work, this marvelous work  and a wonder, the work that will  eventually fill the whole world—and  neither man nor the devil can pre-  vent it—commenced, as all the  works of our God begin, in a small   way. It was likened by the Savior  to the mustard seed, the smallest of   all seeds, put in the soil, which grew  until the fowls of the air could   lodge in the branches thereof. This  certainly is the characterestic of  this Church and Kingdom, com-  mencing as it did on the 6th day of   April, 1830, with only six members.  But the Lord told Joseph in one of  the revelations that he was laying  the foundation of a great work, how   great he knew not. Joseph was  young at that time, and could not  comprehend fully the nature of the   work which he had been called and  appointed to commence in the earth.    When Joseph presented to the   Christian world the principles that  God had communicated to him, he  at once aroused their prejudices; he   had to struggle against traditions   which they had inherited from their   fathers who knew not God nor His   ways, traditions which had come  down to them through the ages,  which were antagonistic to the sav-  ing truths of heaven. And hence   his life was one continual struggle,   meeting with opposition on every   hand, especially from the priests of   the day; but he lived through it   and rejoiced greatly in his labors un-  til he finished his testimony in the   flesh, after laboring some fourteen  years to that end. He had to wade   through deep waters; but he never  was discouraged or disheartened,  notwithstanding he had to contend  against foes without and foes within.   He never lost sight of the majesty  of his calling, nor the divinity of this  work; but spake and acted in the   midst of the people under all cir-  cumstances the man that he was—  the Prophet of God, the Seer and  Revelator of the last dispensation.  He left us under painful circum-  stances, sealing his testimony with   his blood; but his works follow him.   The Gospel of the Kingdom which  he preached, flourished under the   wise administration of God's ser-  vants who followed him. The Lord  blessed and sustained His Apostles,  and led them to this land, where  the standard of Zion has been   planted, which begins already to  attract the notice of the nations  afar off. And here in this land, not-  withstanding the difficulties we  have had to wrestle with, incident  to settling a new country a thous-  and miles from civilization, having  also to protect ourselves against the  raids of the wild and untutored In-  dians, the Lord has prospered us,   and blessed us on every hand; and   we are to-day a blessed people. Yet  the Christian world is opposed to us,   and the Christians generally hate  us. The Savior himself had the  same spirit and feeling to contend  against. There was no man more   unpopular than He; no man more  persecuted than He. And why? Be-  cause He preached false doctrine?  No. The real reason was, as He   himself declared, because they loved  darkness better than light, because  their deeds were evil. There are   but the two powers, that of God and  that of the devil. There is but the  one true and living God, and He is   our Eternal Father, the creator of  this earth; and He will give it to  His children to inherit.    We are nearing the end of the 6th  thousandth year. We have the   history, or a partial history, of the  dealings of God with the nations   from the day of Father Adam down  as contained in the Bible and the   Book of Mormon, from which we   may learn many valuable lessons.  God has raised up at different ages   certain men to do a certain work, as  He raised up father Abraham. He  was a noble spirit, we are told, be-  fore he left the realms of glory to   come and tabernacle in the flesh.   He had the spirit of the Gods with  him when he was born; and he was   faithful to God, and He had con-  fidence in him; and whatever God   required at his hands, he performed.   So with Enoch. He stood at the  head of the dispensation in which   he lived. He, in the course of time,   some 350 years, built and perfected  the city called Zion. He, however,   met with all kinds of opposition   from the people among whom he  labored; but the power of God was  manifested to such an exten[t] that   his enemies stood and trembled  through fear; and through that   power he was enabled to perform  the mighty work which he and his   people did; it was not because the   devil and his party were any more   kindly disposed towards the Saints   of God, but because they could not   help themselves; and in the wisdom   of God Enoch and his people and   their city were taken away from   the earth.    The devil in different ages has  made war against the Saints   and overcome them; and he has tried   his best to destroy this Church and  Kingdom. As I have said, Joseph   and the first Elders met with the   fiercest kind of opposition; but, with   some exceptions, we have stood it  all, and are the better to-day for  having passed through the fire.  When we went upon our first for-  eign mission, Joseph said to us, "No  matter what may come upon you,   round up your shoulders and bear   it, and always sustain and defend   the interests of the Church and  Kingdom of God. When we took   our departure his demeanor in part-  ing was something that I had never   noticed or experienced before. After   crossing the Mississippi River I   crawled to the side of a house and   lay down upon a side of sole leather,  while suffering from the chills and  fever. While resting there the   Prophet Joseph came along and saw   me. He gave me some parting ad-  vice in answer to some remarks   made, and then told me to get up   and go on, and all would be well   with me. That is the way I parted  with him upon that occasion. From   that day to this I have noticed the   steady growth and increase of this  people. We have nothing else to do  but to build up the Kingdom of God.   If we do this He will keep us and  provide for us. We want to labor  as a body of Priesthood, to enter in-  to the holy of holies; we want to  come before God and pray until we   get the spirit of this work, until we   comprehend our calling before God.    There has never been such a dis-  pensation upon the earth as the  present one. In other dispensations   men had to lay down their lives,  and others to hide up in dens and  caves of the earth, and wander in  sheep skins and goat skins, for the  word of God. We have had a taste  of the same treatment in our day.   And we have also seen days of   poverty. When for instance, we  left to go on our first English mis-  sion, two dollars would have bought   everything I left to feed and clothe   my wife and children. I hardly had a  day's provisions in my house. It was   a good deal so with my brethren;   but we did not stay to nurse our   wives. Those were the days of our  poverty; and we never knew what  it was to be comfortably well off un-  til we came to these valleys of the   mountains. We had a great many   trials in those days o[r] what we call-  ed trials. I want to get this princi-  ple into your minds, that God Al-  mighty is guiding the course of this  Church and Kingdom, and not we;  and He has organized it for this   day and generation and it never will   be rooted out of the earth again.  The Prophet Joseph knew what he  was doing; in fact, he knew much   more than he dared to tell on ac-  count of the prejudice, traditions,   and unbelief of the people. I used   to have peculiar feelings about his  death and the way in which his life   was taken. I felt that if, with the   consent and good feelings of the  brethren that waited on him after  he crossed the river to leave Nauvoo,   Joseph could have had his   desire, he would have pioneered   the way to the Rocky Mountains.   But since then I have been fully  reconciled to the fact that it was ac-  cording to the programme, that it  was required of him, as the head of   this dispensation, that he should  seal his testimony with his blood,   and go hence to the spirit world,   holding the keys of this dispensa-  tion, to open up the mission that is  now being performed by way of  preaching the Gospel to the "spirits  in prison." But those who shed his   blood, and the people and nation  who sanctioned it in their hearts,  have that to meet, and they can no  more escape the penalty thereof  than they can escape the death of  the body. My views and feelings   in regard to the Twelve and leading   men of this Church have been this,   that when they leave this stage of  action they will be permitted to lie  down in peace surrounded by their   families and friends; and also, that  God will never require them to stain   their hand with the blood of   their fellow men, in order  to protect themselves from violence;  but, that the Lord will fight our bat-  tles, and frustrate the measures that  would lead to such an issue. And  the wisdom of this is manifested in   the fact part of our duty is to build   Temples, and officiate in the same;  and this we could not do so accept-  ably to God if our hands were stain-  ed with the blood of our fellowmen,   even in our own defense. Hence I   believe that God will cause the   wicked to slay the wicked; and that   He will cut off our enemies by   judgment from time to time, as it   shall be deemed prudent by Him.   All is peace in Zion, and I thank  God for it. I am reminded of a   saying made by Brother Cannon  upon entering the well furnished   parlor of one of President Merrill's  houses, of Richmond, in Cache  County. "What," he said, "all   this and heaven too?" Yes, God in-  tends to give to His Saints the good   things of the earth, as well as the   blessings of heaven, as they shall  become able to use them properly,  and in his fear.    The Lord intends to build up His   Zion through us His weak and   feeble creatures. He intends to   make Zion strong and powerful in  the earth. He will bless us with  means, and He will put it into our  hearts to build Temples to His  name, in which His Saints may  perform the work that is required at  their hands in redeeming their  dead.    Brethren and sisters, you should   live by faith, realizing every day   that all power rests with God, and   that it is through Him that we are   able to live in peace and enjoy   plenty; that it is through Him the  wrath of our enemies is turned aside  from time to time, and that it will   be through Him that the remainder  of their wrath will be restrained  You should enter your secret closets,   and call upon the name of the Lord.  Many of you have learned how to  pray; then fail not to let your   prayers ascend up into the ears of  the God of Sabaoth; and He will  hear you. I think sometimes that  we do not fully comprehend the   power that we have with God in  knowing how to approach Him ac-  ceptably. All that these men hold-  ing the Priesthood, and all that our  sisters need do, is to live near to   God, and call upon Him, pouring out   their soul's desires in behalf of Is-  rael, and their power will be felt,   and their confidence in God will be   strengthened. But the blessings of   heaven can only be obtained and   controlled upon the principles of  righteousness. I have heard the   Prophet Joseph pray when the pow-  er of God rested down upon him,   and all who heard him felt it; and I   have seen his prayers answered in a   marvelous manner almost immedi-  ately. Governor Reynolds on one   occasion employed men to try and   kidnap Joseph, and they almost ac-  complished their designs, b[u]t Joseph  had some Gentile friends as well  as his brethren, through whom   he was rescued, and was taken to   Nauvoo and released under a writ of   habeas corpus. But the Governor  continued to harass him with writs,   and was determined to destroy Jos-  eph. Joseph and the Twelve went   before God in prayer, Joseph kneel-  ing before the Lord offered up pray-  er, and asked God to deliver him   from the power of that man.  Among other things he told the  Lord that he was innocent before   Him, and that his heart was heavy  under the persecutions he endured.   In about forty-eight hours from  that time word reached Joseph that  Reynolds had blown his brains out.   Before perpetrating the deed he left   a note on his desk stating, that as  his services were not appreciated by  the people of the State, he took that  course to end his days.    There is another instance that oc-  curs to my mind. A certain man   took a stand against Joseph, and en-  deavored to bring persecution on   him. He went to his God and laid  the matter before Him, asking to   be delivered out of the hands and   power of that wicked man. Joseph  was a Prophet, a Seer, a Revelator.  He was acquainted with God; he   knew the voice of the Spirit when it  spoke to him. After offering up his  prayer, the whispering of the still  small voice came to him saying,   "Wait with patience." The next   day that man was taken sick with   cholera, and died in a few hours  See how quickly the Lord answered   his prayer offered up while a pris-  oner in Liberty Jail. At that time,   Presidents Young, Taylor and sev-  eral of the Twelve were on their way  through Clay County to lay the cor-  ner stones of the Temple, in fulfill-  ment of the revelation given in the Doc-  trine and Covenants, section 118.   Joseph had no sooner called upon   God than he was liberated; and his  prayer answered to the very letter.  The voice of the Spirit again spoke  to him, speaking peace to his soul,  and telling him that his troubles  should be of short duration. It was   but a few days when he had the   pleasure of shaking hands with his  brethren, and enjoying the society   of his family and friends.   Joseph lived to accomplish the work  that was required of him notwith-  standing the persistent and deter-  mined opposition that he had to   contend against. And after his   death the work still went on, God  and His angels all the while guiding  and sustaining by His Spirit the   Prophet Brigham. And He will   continue to sustain His servants;   and through them and His people  Israel He will bring to pass the  greatest and grandest work that the   world has ever known. It is for us to   wake up to a sense of our duty, and  call upon the Lord in humility, and  live near to Him; and our eyes will   be opened, as in the case of the  young man, the servant of the  ancient Prophet Elisha, and we will  see that there are more for us than  against us; and that the element of   opposition tends only to hasten the  fulfillment of the purposes of God.   Put your trust in God and rely on  His promises, living up to the light  and knowledge you possess; and all  will be well with you whether living  or dying.   God bless you, Amen. 
 Afton, Wyo. Feb. 21 [18]98    Bro. Wilford Woodruff,  Salt Lake City, Utah.    Dear Brother: Yours of the   7th inst. came to hand day before  yesterday. In reply to same  will say, that I feel it a   pleasure and great priviledge  to be counted worthy to be called  to go and preach the Gospel.    Although I feel very weak in   doing as I am perfectly willing  to go and do my best in spreading  the true Gospel in the land and   to preach the same to those who   dwell in darkness.    I shall make all pre-  parations to start, for the place  assigned me viz: Eastern States, 
 THE DESERET WEEKLY.  Truth and Liberty.  No. 18. SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH, APRIL 21, 1894. VOL. XLVIII.    THE LAW OF ADOPTION.  Discourses delivered at the General Conference of the Church, in the  Tabernacle, Salt Lake City, Sunday morning, April 8, 1894, by  PRESIDENTS WILFORD WOODRUFF and GEORGE Q. CANNON  -[REPORTED BY ARTHUR WINTER.]-    PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF.  I feel thankful for the privilege of  meeting with so many of the Latter-day  Saints this morning. In order to pre-  sent my position before the Saints I  wish to say that I have been a member  of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-  day Saints over sixty years, a member  of the Quorum of the Apostles fifty-five   years, and the President of the Church  for a short time. During all these years,  and in all my travels, I have never seen  a moment when I have had the power  to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ or  to administer in any of the ordinances  of the House of the Lord, acceptably to  God or to myself, only by the assistance  of the Holy Ghost; and I do not know  of any other man that could ever do  this. Even the Son of God, in referring  to His work, said: "I do nothing of my-  self; but as my Father hath taught me,  I speak these things." [##John 8:28##] So it has been  with all the prophets and patriarchs in  every age of the world; they have had  to be assisted by the power of God. I  occupy that position today before this  assembly. Therefore, as the Lord com-  manded us not to speak only as we are  moved upon by the Holy Ghost, I  desire that, and in order to obtain it I  want the prayers and faith of the Latter-  day Saints.    I have some things resting upon me  that I wish to present before the Latter-  day Saints, and in order to do this I will  call upon President George Q. Cannon  to read from the Book of Doctrine and  Covenants concerning the subject which  I wish to speak upon.    -[President Cannon read from sec. 128,  as follows:    It may seem to some to be a very bold doc-  trine that we talk of—a power which records or  binds on earth, and binds in heaven.  Never-  theless in all ages of the world, whenever the  Lord has given a dispensation of the Priesthood  to any man by actual revelation, or any set of  men, this power has always been given.  Hence,  whatsoever those men did in authority, in the  name of the Lord, and did it truly and faith-  fully, and kept a proper and faithful record of  the same, it became a law on earth and in  heaven, and could not be annulled, according  to the decrees of the great Jehovah. This is a  faithful saying! Who can hear it?    And again, for the precedent, ##Matthew 16:18-19|Matthew xvi.   18, 19##, "And I also say unto them, that thou  art Peter: and upon this rock I will build my  church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail  against it; and I will give unto thee the keys of  the kingdom of heaven, and whatsoever thou  shalt bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven;  and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth, shall  be loosed in heaven."    Now the great and grand secret of the whole  matter, and the summum bonum of the whole  subject that is lying before us, consists in ob-  taining the powers of the Holy Priesthood.  For him to whom these keys are given, there is  is no difficult in obtaining a knowledge of  facts in relation to the salvation of th children  of men, both as well for the dead as for the   living.    Herein is glory and honor, and immortality  and eternal life. The ordinance of baptism by  water, to be immersed therein in order to an-  swer to the likeness of the dead, that one prin-  ciple might accord with the other. To be  immersed in the water and come forth out of   the water is in the likeness of the resurrection  of the dead in coming forth out of their graves;  hence this ordinance was instituted to form a  relationship with the ordinance of baptism for  the dead being in likeness of the dead.    Consequently the baptismal font is insti-  tuted as a simile of the grave, and was com-  manded to be in a place underneath where the  living are wont to assemble, to show forth the  living and the dead; and that all things may  have their likeness, and that they may accord  one with another; that which is earthly con-  forming to that which is heavenly, as Paul hath  declared, ##1 Corinthians 15:46-48|I Corinthians XV. 46, 47, and 48##.    "Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual,  but that which is natural, and afterwards that  which is spiritual. The first man is of the  earth, earthy; the second man is the Lord,  from heaven. As is the earthy, such are they  also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly,  such are they also that are heavenly."  And as  are the records on the earth in relation to your  dead, which are truly made out, so also are the  records in heaven. This therefore, is the seal-  ing and binding power and in one sense of the  word, the keys of the kingdom which consist in  the key of knowledge.    And now, my dearly beloved brethren and   sisters, let me assure you that these are prin-  ciples in relation to the dead, and the living,  that cannot be lightly passed over, as pertaining  to our salvation.  For their salvation is neces-  sary, and essential to our salvation, as Paul  says concerning the fathers "that they without  us cannot be made perfect," neither can we  without our dead be made perfect.    And now, in relation to the baptism for the  dead, I will give you another quotation of Paul,  ##1 Corinthians 15:29|I Corinthians XV, 29##, "Else what shall they do  which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise  not at all; why are they then baptized for the  dead?"    And again, in connection with this quotation,  I will give you a quotation from one of the  prophets, who had his eye fixed on the restora-  tion of the Priesthood, the glories to be revealed  in the last days, and in an especial manner this;  most glorious of all subjects belonging to the  everlasting gospel, viz., the baptism for the  dead; for Malachi says, ##Malachi 4:5-6|last chapter, verses 5th  and 6th##, "Behold, I will send you Elijah the  prophet, before the coming of the great and  dreadful day of the Lord; and he shall turn the  heart of the fathers to the children, and the  heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come  and smite the earth with a curse."    I might have rendered a plainer translation  to this, but it is sufficiently plain to suit my  purpose as it stands. It is sufficient to know,  in this case, that the earth will be smitten with  a curse, unless there is a welding link of some  kind or other, between the fathers and the  children, upon some subject or other, and be-  hold what is that subject?  It is the baptism for  the dead. For we without them cannot be  made perfect; neither can they without us be  made perfect. Neither can they nor we, be  made perfect, without those who have died in  the gospel also; for it isnecessary in the usher-  ing in of the dispensation of the fulness of times;  which dispensation isnow beginning to usher  in, that a whole and complete and perfect  union, and welding together of dispensations,   and keys, and power, and glories should take  place, and be revealed from the days of Adam  even to the present time; and not only this, but  those things which never have been revealed  from the foundation of the world, but have  been kept hid from the wise and prudent, shall  be revealed unto babes and sucklings in this  the dispensation of the fulness of times.    Now, what do we hear in the gospel which  we have received? "A voice of gladness!  A  voice of mercy from heaven; and a voice of  truth out of the earth; glad tiding for the dead;  a voice of gladness for the living and the dead;  glad tidings of great joy; how beautiful upon  the mountains are the feet of those that bring  glad tidings of good things; and that say unto  Zion, behold! thy God reigneth.  As the dews   of Carmel, so shall the knowledge of God   descent upon them."    And again, what do we hear?  Glad tidings  from Cumorah! Moroni, an angel from heaven,  declaring the fulfillment of the prophets—the  book to be revealed. A voice of the Lord in  the wilderness of Fayette, Seneca county, de-  claring the three witnesses to bear record of the  book. The voice of Michael on the banks of  the Susquehanna, detecting the devil when he  appeared as an angel of light.

 INFIDELITY OF THE CHRISTIAN WORLD, ETC. 187    the revelations of God to man. And   this being the case, if the Lord has   any people on the face of the earth,   they should be increasing in faith in  him. You let a Christian come here,   no matter who, whether he be a   minister, professor, or believer, or  any one who professes to believe in   the Bible, and let him ask an Elder  in Israel—"Do you really believe, in  your soul, sincerely before the Lord,   that Mormonism is true?" When  the Elder answers him "yes," he is   about as much astonished as we were  yesterday when these magazines ex-  ploded. The fact of it is, as I said   before, the world do not believe in   God or in revelation, and they mar-  vel very greatly to find any man who  has really got independence of mind  enough to stand up and say—"I  believe that Joseph Smith was a   Prophet of God, and I believe in the  revelations that were given through  him; I believe in the literal fulfill-  ment of prophecy, as written in the  Bible." To hear men say this   astonishes the whole Christian world,  and it astonishes the Latter-day   Saints to see the amount of darkness  and infidelity that are abroad in the  earth. Hence, as Latter-day Saints,   I think it requires on our part an in-  crease of faithfulness in the practice  of our religion, and in the various  revelations of God contained in the  Bible, Book of Mormon, and Book of  Doctrine and Covenants.    We see before our eyes, year after  year, the signs of heaven and of   earth, and the fulfillment of prophecy,   but how much are we as a people  increasing in faith in God? Do we  increase in that respect in proportion  to the increase of infidelity in the  world? Perhaps I am not a judge,  but it appears to me that we do not   comprehend. The work in which we   are engaged, and the Bible, Book of   Mormon, and the Book of Doctrine   and Covenants, are just as true to-  day as they were twenty, thirty, or   forty years ago, when we shouldered  our knapsacks and valises, and tra-  veled on foot from city to city, State  to State, and from country to coun-  try, to preach the word of God with-  out money and without price, trust-  ing in the living God to sustain and  uphold us in our missions. I say   that this work is just as true now as  then, and so is the saying which I   quoted—"Who am I, saith the Lord,  that I command and am not obeyed?   Who am I, saith the Lord, that I   promise and do not fulfill?" I be-  lieve that the Lord will fulfill what  he says; I believe that he will fulfill   his promises unto the Latter-day   Saints and unto the world, unto  Zion and Babylon; and if he does,  there is something at the door, some-  thing for us, as Latter-day Saints, to  do. I believe the Lord has held   every man responsible, from the day  of our great progenitor, father Adam,   into whose hands the Holy Priest-  hood and the keys of the kingdom of  God have been committed; and I   believe that every man, every set of   men, and every people, will be held  responsible, in time and eternity, for   the use they have made of the gifts,  blessings, and promises which have   been given unto them. The amount  of it is, that if any people undertake  to keep a celestial law, it is their pri-  vilege to enjoy the spirit and power   of that law; it is also the privilege of   any man or set of men, who ever   received the Gospel, to enjoy the   blessings of that Gospel, no matter  what age of the world they may have  lived in. Every person who has ever  repented of his sins, and has been  baptized for their remission, after the  order of God, and after the similitude   of Jesus Christ, who was buried in  water in the likeness of his death,   and came forth in the likeness of his

 keys of the kingdom, and of the dispensation of   the fulness of times.    And again, the voice of God in the chamber   of old father Whitmer, in Fayette, Seneca   county, and at sundry times, and in divers   places through the travels and tribulations  of this Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day   Saints.  And the voice of Michael, the arch-  angel; the voice of Gabriel, and of Raphael, and   of divers angels, from Michael or Adam, down   to the present time, all declaring their dispen-  sation, their rights, their keys, their honors,   their majesty and glory, and the power of their  Priesthood; giving line upon line, precept upon   precept; here a little, and there a little—giving   us consolation by holding forth that which is to   come, confirming our hope.    Resuming, President Woodruff said:  Thus you have before you the subject  which is resting upon us, and which we   wish to present to the Latter-day Saints.  Let me say that age has very little to do   with revelation. In the early age of  the world, old father Adam, three years  previous to his death—he being nearly   one thousand years of age—called to-  gether his posterity in the valley of   Adam-ondi-Ahman, and he stood upon   his feet for hours, clothed with the   power of God and the revelations of   heaven, and blessed his posterity, some  seven of whom,each representing a gen  eration, were High Priests. Among  them were Enoch and Methusaleh, both   great men of their day and generation. [##Doctrine and Covenants 107:53##]  He prophesied upon them what should  transpire with their posterity unto the   end of time. His old age did not have   any effect whatever upon the revela-  tions of God to him. Joseph Smith,  when fourteen years of age, while  calling upon God in the wilderness, had  the heavens opened unto him. Both   the Father and the Son presented them-  selves unto him in the clouds of heaven,   and the Father said, "This is my beloved  Son; hear him." [##Joseph Smith-History 1:17##] The age of man is very   short indeed in this day to what it was  in ancient days. Men anciently lived to   a very great age. When four or five   hundred years old they took wives,  begat children, and raised up posterity.  Today our age is limited to something  like three score years and ten.    I wish to say to the Latter-day Saints  that we live in a very important gen-  eration. We are blessed with power  and authority, holding the Holy Priest-  hood by the commandment of God, to   stand upon the earth and redeem both   the living and the dead. If we did not   do it, we should be damned and cut off   from the earth, and the God of Israel   would raise up a people who would do   it. The Lord would not permit me to   occupy this position one day of my life,   unless I was susceptible to the Holy  Spirit and to the revelations of God. It   is too late in the day for this Church to   stand without revelation. Not only the  President of the Church should possess  this gift and give it unto the people, but   his counselors and the Apostles and all   men that bear the Holy Priesthood, if   they magnify their calling, should pos-  sess that gift for themselves and to   assist them in their duties, although they   may not be called to give revelations to   lead and direct the Church. The spirit   of revelation belongs to the Priesthood.    But to come to the subject before us.  Perhaps it may be said by the inquiring   or the objecting mind, What have you   to say about redeeming the dead, or   about baptism for the dead, or the work   of the Temples of our God, that is not   already revealed? I will say this: When  the Prophet joseph had this revelation   from heaven, what did he do?  There  are witnesses here of what he did. He   never stopped till he got the fulness of   the word of God to him concerning the   baptism for the dead. But before doing   so he went into the Mississippi river,  and so did I, as well as others, and we   each baptized a hundred for the dead,   without a man to record a single act   that we performed. Why did we do it?   Because of the feeling of joy that we   had, to think that we in the flesh could   stand and redeem our dead. We did   not wait to know what the result of this  would be, or what the whole of it   should be. Finally the Lord told the  Prophet: "When any of you are bap-  tized for your dead, let there be a   recorder, and let him be eye witness of   your baptisms; let him hear with his  ears, that he may testify of a truth,   saith the Lord; that in all your record-  ings it may be recorded in heaven;   whatsoever you bind on earth may be  bound in heaven; whatsoever you loose  on earth, may be loosed in heaven." [##Doctrine and Covenants 127:6-7##]  That was the beginning of this work.    Joseph Smith, instead of living to be   nearly a thousand years of age as   Adam did, lived to be about thirty-eight   years of age. He brought forth the   record of the stick of Joseph in the hands   of Ephraim—the history of the ancient   inhabitants of this continent. [##Ezekiel 37:16-20##] By the   power of God he translated that, and it  has been published in many languages.   Besides this, he organized the Church   of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints upon   the foundation of apostles and proph-  ets, Christ Jesus being the chief corner  stone. Men were ordained to the Priest-  hood and sent forth, from the various  occupations of life, to carry this Gospel  to the world. God informed Joseph   Smith that he was called to prune the  vineyard once more for the last time  before the coming of the Son of Man.  Since that, thousands of Elders of  Israel have been sent into the world   to preach the Gospel. Joseph Smith   did all this during the fifteen years he   held the Priesthood. Let any man read   the revelations in the Book of Doctrine   and Covenants, which were given   through him during the little time he   spent here in the flesh. It is one of the   greatest records that any man ever gave   to the human family. Not only this, but   he organized the endowments and did a   great, deal of other work. Who could   expect him, during the short time he   lived in the flesh, to do more than he   did? I received my endowments from   under his hands. He brought forth all   these ordinances that have been given   unto the Latter-day Saints. In fact, it   is a marvel and a wonder that he per-  formed as much as he did.    I want to say, as the President of the   Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day   Saints, that we should now go on and   progress. We have not got through   revelation. We have not got through   the work of God. But at this period   we want to go on and fulfill this com-  mandment of God given through   Malachi—that the Lord should send   Elijah the prophet, "and he shall turn   the heart of the fathers to the children,   and the heart of the children to their   fathers, lest I come and smite the earth   with a curse." [##Malachi 4:5-6##] Ye sons of men, I say   unto you, in the name of Israel's God,   those very principles that God has re-  vealed are what have stayed the judg-  ments of the Almighty on the earth.   Were it not for these principles, you and   I would not be here today. We have  had prophets and apostles. Presi-    dent Young, who followed President   Joseph Smith, led us here. He organ-  ized these Temples and carried out the   purposes of his calling and office. He   laid the foundation of this great Temple   on this block, as well as others in the   mountains of Israel. What for? That   we might carry out these principles of   redemption for the dead. He accom-  plished all that God required at his   hands. But he did not receive all the   revelations that belong to this work;   neither did President Taylor, nor has   Wilford Woodruff. There will be no   end to this work until it is perfected.    I want to lay before you what there is   for us to do at the present time; and in   doing this I desire particularly the at-  tention of President Lorenzo Snow, of   the Salt Lake Temple; President M. W.   Merrill, of the Logan Temple; President   J. D. T. McAllister, of the Manti Temple,   and President D. H. Cannon, of the St.   George Temple, and those associated   with them. You have acted up to all   the light and knowledge that you have   had; but you have now something more   to do than what you have done. We   have not fully carried out those princi-  ples in fulfillment of the revelations of   God to us, in sealing the hearts of the   fathers to the children and the children   to the fathers. I have not felt satisfied,   neither did President Taylor, neither has  any man since the Prophet Joseph who   has attended to the ordinance of adop-  tion in the temples of our God. We   have felt that there was more to be re-  vealed upon this subject than we had   received. Revelations were given to us   in the St. George Temple, which Presi-  dent Young presented to the Church of   God. Changes were made there, and   we still have more changes to make, in   order to satisfy our Heavenly Father,   satisfy our dead and ourselves. I will   tell you what some of them are. I have   prayed over this matter, and my breth-  ren have. We have felt as President   Taylor said, that we have got to have  more revelation concerning sealing   under the law of adoption. Well, what   are these changes? One of them is the   principle of adoption. In the com-  mencement of adopting men and   women in the Temple at Nauvoo, a  great many persons were adopted to   different men who were not of the   lineage of their fathers, and there was a   spirit manifested by some in that work   there that was not of God. Men would   go out and electioneer and labor with   all their power to get men adopted to   them. One instance I will name here:   A man went around Nauvoo asking   every man he could, saying, "You come   and be adopted to me, and I shall stand   at the head of the Kingdom, and you   will be there with me." Now, what is   the truth about this? Those who were   adopted to that man, if they go with   him, will have to go where he is. He   was a participator in that horrible scene  —the Mountain Meadow massacre. Men   have tried to lay that to President   Young. I was with President Young   when the massacre was first reported to   him. President Young was perfectly   horrified at the recital of it, and wept   over it. He asked: "Was there any   white man had anything to do with  that?" The reply was, No; and by the   representations then made to him he   was misinformed concerning the whole   transaction. I will say here, and call   heaven and earth to witness, that Presi-  dent Young, during his whole life, never   was the author of the shedding of the

 188 JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.    resurrection, has a right to the Holy  Ghost; it is promised, and it belongs   to him; it is the right of all persons  to enjoy this, and if they receive the  Holy Ghost and its gifts, they have  inspiration, light, and truth; they  have eyes to see, ears to hear, and   hearts to understand, and they should   be in a position before the Lord that  they can comprehend his work far   more perfectly than the world, for   they have not obeyed the Gospel of   Christ, and they have no right to, or   claim upon, the gifts of that Gospel.   But all who, in any age of the world,   obey the Gospel, have a right to the   Comforter, and to inspiration and   revelation, they belong to them, and  the Lord never had a people on the   face of the earth who did not have a  right to these gifts, and it was their  privilege and duty to enjoy them.    This is the difference between those   who keep celestial law, the law of the   Gospel of Jesus Christ, and those   who do not. But, as I have re-  marked, all in every age of the world  who have received a dispensation of  the Gospel, are responsible before the  Lord for their acts, and for the man-  ner in which they have used their  blessings and privileges. The Pro-  phets and Apostles in every age have   been held responsible for the manner   in which they made use of the Gospel   of Christ when committed unto them;   and that is the way it is with us to-  day. One thing is evident to every-  body who reflects at all upon the   things of the kingdom of God—when-  ever the Lord chooses a people out   of the world, they are hated by the  world, and are unpopular in the   world. This has been the case in  every age. It was so in the days of   Jesus Christ. He came to his own  father's house—the Jews; he was of   the lineage of Abraham, and when he  came to his own brethren he was un-  popular, he was rejected and opposed. [##Matthew 1:1##]  They did not like him nor his course.   They were looking for Shiloh to   come, but not as a babe born in a   stable and cradled in a manger, and   traveling on from that to the cross   and the grave in poverty and afflic-  tion, without military authority, and  without power to govern and control,   and to deliver and uphold the Jews   as a nation. Christ came as the babe  of Bethlehem, the lowest almost of   the human family, and remained so   up to the day of his death. A poorer   man never lived, that I know of, in   Judea and Jerusalem, than Jesus   Christ. Who were his followers?   They were not the great, rich, learned,   noble, High Priests, or leading men   of Judea; many of them were illi-  terate fishermen, poor men, weak   things of the world; they were the  class that Jesus chose for his disciples,   and into their hands he gave the   keys of the kingdom of God; he  gave them the Apostleship, the power  to bind and to seal both on earth and   in heaven. Their deeds and labors   reached not only through this world,  but they reached into the eternal  worlds, and will affect the inhabitants   of Judea and Jerusalem from that   day, I may say, into eternity. Those   disciples of Christ received the Holy  Priesthood, the Gospel of Christ, and   the keys of the kingdom of God, and   Jesus held them responsible to the  day of their death for the course  they pursued. However much they  were despised by the world, they were  held responsible for bearing a true   and faithful testimony to Jew and  Gentile, of Jesus Christ being the   true Shepherd and the Savior of the   world.    And so I will say about the Latter-  day Saints and the work they are   engaged in. Ezekiel says that in the  last days the stick of Joseph in the  hands of Ephraim should be placed  with the stick of Judah, before the [##Ezekiel 37:15-20##] 
 go forth and bear a true and faithful testimony  to the nations of the earth and the isles of the   sea, and have preached unto them the gospel of  Christ, and what has been the consequence?—  The words of the Lord have been fulfilled to the   very letter, for wherever this Gospel has been  preached there have been hypocrites, the wicked  and ungodly, and there also have been the honest  and the meek of the earth, and whoever have re-  ceived this testimony, been baptized for the re-  mission of sins, received the laying on of hands   for the gift of the Holy Ghost—have had their   minds enlightened, and they have looked forward   with an eye of faith to see the fulfilment   of what God has promised.    Have we as a Church been disappointed in   anything? No, we have not, but the Lord has   fulfilled his promises in relation to the things of   his kingdom.    The Lord has chosen men like Joseph and Hy-  rum, the Smith family, and the Twelve Apostles,  and they have been humble men in this church  and kingdom, and almost all the officers have been   called from the laboring class, from the plow,  from the hammer and the anvil, and from nearly   every occupation, and their words have pierced   the honest in heart, for they have had all the   power, blessings and knowledge which the Lord  has given unto them, and they have given the   honor and glory to God. I will venture to say  there is no people upon the earth who have been  picked up as we have been, for we have been  gathered from all religions and sects.    The Elders have gone forth teaching and bap-  tizing the people; they have laid their hands upon   the sick and healed them, cast out devils, and had   power to do all those things which the Lord has   promised unto believers. Wherever the people  have received the truth the signs have followed—  the lame have been made to walk, the deaf to   hear, the blind to see; fevers have been rebuked  and the elements have been subject to the Elders  of Israel. Where is there a man who has gone   out to preach the gospel who has not been con-  strained by the Spirit to warn the people, as mes-  sengers of salvation, of the judgments that are  coming upon the earth?    We have been called upon to warn all who   came in our way, including kings, rulers, the  rich, and learned, as well as the poor and humble.  It is true that the Lord might have enlightened  the minds of the rulers, the rich and learned and  chosen them to have performed his work in the  establishment of his Church upon the earth, but  he never has seen fit to work through that chan-  nel, but he has ever chosen the poor and humble  as his messengers upon the earth.    There is another thing which I desire to allude   to, and that is the very excellent discourse we  have heard to-day, and the testimony of the ser-  vants of God in relation to our present position.   The opposition that we have had and the perse-  cutions we have passed through have been allud-  ed to by br. Taylor, and all those matters are in  fulfilment of what the angel told br. Joseph, and   as long as Satan rules in the world this spirit of  mobocracy will manifest itself, even until the  scenery shall be wound up, and until he who  holds the keys of the bottomless pit shall bind him  with a chain, cast him into the pit and shut   him up, and put a seal upon him.    We expect this. It is what we are looking for,  and yet we above all people have reason to re-  joice; we have reason to rejoice in him who   stands at the helm, and who has nourished and  sustained this kingdom from the beginning. The  God of heaven has never forsaken this work, but   he has ever backed up his servants and opened   their way before them.    How the soul of the Prophet rejoiced when he  beheld the work of God spreading abroad in the  earth, the truth received by the children of men,   and the promises of God verified to the letter, in  the gathering of the Saints and a way prepared  for the establishment of Zion upon the earth.    We have had the holy Priesthood conferred   upon us, and the power of God has surrounded   us, so that we have been preserved thus far from  the hands of our enemies in the midst of the many   circumstances in which we have been placed.   Those things should increase our faith before the   Lord and give us confidence in his promises, and  it should inspire our hearts to diligence in the  fulfilment of every duty required of us.    The Lord says, in the revelations contained in  the Book of Doctrine and Covenants that this   gospel shall be preached in all the world, and he   commands his servants to call upon all nations to   repent and obey the voice of God, to receive the   gospel and the words of eternal life. He says:    'Lift up your voices and spare not. Call upon  the nations to repent, both old and young, both  bond and free; saying,—Prepare yourselves for  the great day of the Lord: for if I, who am a  man, do lift up my voice and call upon you to  repent, and ye hate me, what will ye say when  the day cometh when the thunders shall utter  their voices from the ends of the earth, speaking  to the ears of all that live, saying: Repent and  prepare for the great day of the Lord! yea, and  again, when the lightnings shall streak forth from  the east unto the west, and shall utter forth their  voices unto all that live, and make the ears of all  tingle, that hear, saying these words: Repent ye,   for the great day of the Lord is come!    6 And again, the Lord shall utter his voice out   of heaven, saying: Hearken, O ye nations of the   earth, and hear the word of that God who made  you. O, ye nations of the earth, how often  would I have gathered you together as a hen  gathereth her chickens under her wings, but ye  would not! How oft have I called you by the   mouth of my servants, and by the ministering of   angels, and by mine own voice, and by the voice  of thunderings, and by the voice of lightnings,  and by the voice of tempests, and by the voice of   earthquakes and great hailstorms, and by the  voice of famines and pestilences of every kind,   and by the great sound of a trump, and by the   voice of judgment, and by the voice of mercy all   the day long, and by the voice of glory and honor,    and the riches of eternal life, and would have   saved you with an everlasting salvation, but ye  would not! Behold the day has come, when the  cup of the wrath of mine indignation is full.    7 Behold, verily I say unto you, that these are  the words of the Lord your God: wherefore, la-  bor ye, labor ye in my vineyard for the last time:  for the last time call upon the inhabitants of the   earth, for in my own due time will I come upon  the earth in judgment; and my people shall be re-  deemed and shall reign with me on earth; for the  great millennial, of which I have spoken by the mouth  of my servants, shall come; for satan shall be  bound; and when he is loosed again, he shall   only reign for a little season, and then cometh the end   of the earth; and he that liveth in righteous-  ness, shall be changed in the twinkling of an eye;  and the earth shall pass away so as by fire; and  the wicked shall go away into unquenchable fire; and   their end no man knoweth on earth, nor ever  shall know, until they come before me in judg-  ment'—[Doc. and Covs, sec. xiv, page 177.    I look upon these things; I reflect upon our  government in the manner which has been re-  ferred to to-day; I look at the liberal laws and   Constitution that exist in our land upon which   our Government is founded, and yet in the midst  of all this, we have not had the privilege of en-  joying our rights, or worshipping God or enjoying  our religion, without persecution and oppression.   The Lord has frequently given us revelations upon  these things, and he has spoken concerning our   government and Constitution, and he has said 'ye  are justified in maintaining the Constitution and  laws of the land, for they make you free and the  gospel maketh you free, and you shall seek to  sustain good and wise men for rulers, and what-  soever is more or less than this cometh of evil.'  Do you blame the Latter Day Saints? Can the  Lord, can angels, or can anybody blame the Lat-  ter Day Saints for rejecting such cursed, corrupt  scoundrels as we have had here? The laws of   heaven command us not to uphold and sustain  men except they are good men, who will sustain  the Constitution of our country, and we are ful-  filling the revelations in this respect as in many  others, and we are carrying out the requirements   of the Constitution of the United States.    We have fulfilled the law of God, and we have  always been willing to receive and respect all  good and wise men in carrying out the laws and  Constitution of our country.    We have plead with the government, we have  plead with the President and we have plead with  the Senate of the United States to send us good   men; br. Taylor has told us they will not do it,  and why? Because they are not good themselves;  they are not virtuous, they are not holy, and they   will not acknowledge the hand of God at all, but  seek to overthrow the blessings and spirit of that   rich legacy bequeathed to us through the blood of   our fathers—the Constitution. Here is where   I consider that our nation, and the whole people   of the United States, are under condemnation; it   is because they have a constitution and laws of  government which the people control, for they  elect their own officers, for all citizens have the   right to vote for their governors, presidents and  officers in general, and hence they come under   condemnation. [Blessed the sacramental cup.]    The whole people have a vote in the selection  of their officers and if they appoint wicked men   or their governors and for their rulers, and then   those rulers go to work and rule unrighteously,   tyrannize over the poor and humble, and sacrifice  human life to satisfy their wicked ambition, at   whose hands will the Lord require the blood of   the innocent? He will require it of those who   elected the officers, for the responsibility does not  rest alone upon the presidents, or governors, or   judges, but it rests in a great measure with the  people who placed them in power, when a nation  becomes corrupt and appoint corrupt and wicked  rulers, and sustains them in their wickedness.    When Joseph and Hyrum Smith were mur-  dered the greater part of the people rejoiced in it,   and would remark that it was a pity the Smiths  had died in the way they had, but it was a good  thing they were out of the way. Governor Ford  said, when speaking to the brethren in Nauvoo,   that almost every man he talked with would say  it was a pity the Smiths should die under the   pledged protection of the Governor of the State,  but yet they were glad they were dead. Will not  God require an atonement at the hands of such men?    Inasmuch as we have trusted in the Lord, and  have found him true to his word, why should we  not trust him now? If the harvest was ripe  twenty or thirty years ago surely it is ripe now,  for the Elders of Israel have gone forth to the   nations, and the people have rejected their testi-  mony.    The more I look at the words which the Lord  has spoken concerning our enemies, and especially  those of this nation, the more I become satisfied   that they will not escape the judgments of the Al-  mighty any more than the Nephites of old did, or   any of the other nations who have rejected the  message sent unto them by the God of Heaven.—   This nation are ripe in iniquity, and the destroy-  ing angels are at their doors; and I am as sure  that the scourges will follow as I am that the   servants of God have borne a true and faithful   testimony unto them. I know what the con-  sequence will be of the world rejecting the truth,   for I have the testimony of Jesus and the Spirit of   God within me, and therefore I say let us look   well to our ways, remember our covenants, our   duties and our prayers and I do hope and pray   that the Elders in Great Salt Lake City, will not  in the midst of their recreations neglect their   prayers on their duties before the Lord, nor per-  mit any thing to stand between them and the  building up the kingdom of God.    Mormonism is just as good as it was a year ago.  The gospel of Jesus Christ is as good as it was a  year ago, or as it was in Kirtland or Nauvoo, and  it is our privilege to continue to increase in bless-  ings, glory, power and virtue from this time hence-  forth and for ever, and therefore I say, brethren   and sisters, let us lay these things to heart, and   let us look at them as they exist before us. Let   us read the revelations of God and give heed to  the teachings of the living Oracles and have faith  in their promises, that we may thereby have the   Spirit of God to enlighten us and to guide us   through this probation.    The Presidency of this Church are good men,  they are filled with the Spirit of the Lord con-  tinually, with the spirit of teaching, of counsel,   which if we follow will lead us on to eternal life,  therefore we are blest, and saved when we obey  their teaching.    We have our leading men, and our Governor,   all of whom have proceeded out of the midst of  us; our judges, our wise men, and our rulers, are  those that have come out of the house of Israel,  and this is a blessing and a privilege that Israel  have not enjoyed for many generations. We see  that the Elders have gone forth and laboured for   the upbuilding of the Kingdom of God, and for  carrying out the purposes of our heavenly   Father and for the accomplishment of the great   work of the latter days.    We have the greatest reason to be thankful of  any people upon the earth, and we should realize  that as we have been preserved heretofore, so we   shall be hereafter, and though the United States,   and though all Europe and hell may make war  upon us yet if we listen to the counsel that has   been given, the blow will be warded off, and what-  ever we may be called to pass through will be  for our salvation, exaltation and glory.    I pray the Lord my heavenly Father to grant  us his Spirit that we may prize our blessings, keep   our covenants, and continually have his favor, and  continue humble and faithful, and that he will  pour out those judgments upon the wicked,   proud and the rebellious which they desire to in-  flict upon the people of God, which may the Lord   grant for Christ's sake:—Amen.

 blood of any of the human family; and  when the books are opened in the day  of judgment these things will be proven  to heaven and earth. Perhaps I had not  ought to enter into these things, but it  came to me. Men are in danger some-  times in being adopted to others, until  they know who they are and what they  will be. Now, what are the feelings of  Israel? They have felt that they wanted  to be adopted to somebody. President  Young was not satisfied in his mind with  regard to the extent of this matter;  President Taylor was not. When I went  before the Lord to know who I should  be adopted to (we were then being  adopted to prophets and apostles,) the  Spirit of God said to me, "Have you not  a father, who begot you?" "Yes, I have."   "Then why not honor him? Why not  be adopted to him?" "Yes," says I,  "that is right." I was adopted to my   father, and should have had my father  sealed to his father, and so on back; and  the duty that I want every man who  presides over a Temple to see performed  from this day henceforth and forever,  unless the Lord Almighty commands  otherwise, is, let every man be adopted  to his father. When a man receives the  endowments, adopt him to his father;  not to Wilford Woodruff, nor to any  other man outside the lineage of his  fathers. That is the will of God to this  people. I want all men who preside  over these temples in these mountains  of Israel to bear this in mind. What  business have I to take away the rights  of the lineage of any man? What right  has any man to do this? No; I say let  every man be adopted to his father; and  then you will do exactly what God said  when he declared He would send Elijah  the prophet in the last days. [##Malachi 4:5##] Elijah the  prophet appeared unto Joseph Smith  and told him that the day had come  when this principle must be carried out. [##Doctrine and Covenants 110:13-16##]  Joseph Smith did not live long enough  to enter any further upon these things.  His sould was wound up with this work  before he was martyred for the word of  God and testimony of Jesus Christ. He  told us that there must be a welding  link of all dispensations and of the work  of God from one generation to another.  This was upon his mind more than most  any other subject that was given to him.  In my prayers the Lord revealed to me,  that it was my duty to say to all Israel   to carry this principle out, and in fulfill-  ment of that revelation I lay it before   this people. I say to all men who are  laboring in these temples, carry out this  principle, and then we will make one  step in advance of what we have had  before. Myself and counselors con-  versed upon this and were agreed upon  it, afterwards we laid it before all  the Apostles who were here (two were  absent—Brothers Thatcher and Lund, the  latter being in England,) and the Lord  revealed to every one of these men—  and they would bear testimony to it if   they were to speak—that that was the  word of the Lord to them. I never met  with anything in my life in this Church  that there was more unity upon than  there was upon that principle. They  all feel right about it, and that it is our   duty. That is one principle that should  be carried out from this time henceforth.  "But," says one, "suppose we come  along to a man who perhaps is a mur-  derer." Well, if he is a murderer, drop  him out and connect with the next man  beyond him. But the Spirit of God will  be with us in this matter. We want the  Latter day Saints from this time to trace    their genealogies as far as they can, and  to be sealed to their fathers and mothers.  Have children sealed to their parents,  and run this chain through as far as you  can get it. When you get to the end,  let the last man be adopted to Joseph  Smith, who stands at the head of the   dispensation. This is the will of the  Lord to this people, and I think when  you come to reflect upon it you will find  it to be true.    Another principle connected with this  subject I want to talk about. A man  has married a woman, and they have a   family of children. The man lays down  in death without ever hearing the Gos-  pel. His wife afterwards hears the  Gospel and embraces it. She comes to  the temple and she wants to be sealed  to her husband, who was a good man.  The feeling has been to deny this and  to say, "No, he was not in the Church,  and you cannot be sealed to your hus-  band." Many of a woman's heart has  ached because of this, and as a servant  of God I have broken that chain a good  while ago. I have laid before every woman  this principle and let her have her choice.  Why deprive a woman of being sealed   to her husband because he never heard  the Gospel? What do any of us know  with regard to him? Will he not hear  the Gospel and embrace it in the spirit  world? Look at Joseph Smith. Not  one of Joseph Smith's fathers or  brothers or sisters were in the convenant  when he received the keys of the king-  dom of God and translated the Book of   Mormon. They afterwards received it.  Every brother and sister that he had,  and his father and his father's brothers,  except Uncle Jesse Smith, embraced  the Gospel. Now, suppose that any of  these had died before they had the op-  portunity of entering into the covenant  with the Lord through the Gospel, as  his brother Alvin did; they would have  been in the same position as Alvin,  concerning whom the Lord,when Joseph  saw him in the celestial kingdom, said:    All who have died without a knowledge of  this Gospel, who would have received it if they  had been permitted to tarry, shall be heirs of the  celestial kingdom of God; also all that shall   die henceforth without a knowledge of it, who  would have received it with all their hearts,  shall be heirs of that kingdom, for I, the Lord,  will judge all men according to their works, ac-  cording to the desire of their hearts.    So it will be with your fathers. There  will be very few, if any, who will not  accept the Gospel, Jesus, while His   body lay in the tomb,went and preached  to the spirits in prison, who were des-  troyed in the days of Noah. After  so long an imprisonment, in torment,  they doubtless gladly embraced the  Gospel, and if so they will be saved in  the kingdom of God. The fathers of this  people will embrace the Gospel. It is  my duty to honor my father who begot  me in the flesh. It is your duty to do  the same. When you do this, the Spirit  of God will be with you. And we shall  continue this work, the Lord adding  light to that which we have already re-  ceived. I have had friends adopted to  me. We all have, more or less. But I  have had peculiar feelings about it, espe-  cially lately. There are men in this con-  gregation who wish to be adopted to  me. I say to them today, if they can   hear me, Go and be adopted to your  fathers, and save your fathers, and  stand at the head of your father's house,  as saviors upon Mount Zion, and God  will bless you in this. This is what I  want to say, and what I want carried  out in our temples.    The Almighty is with this people.    We shall have all the revelations that  we will need, if we will do our duty and  obey the commandments of God. When  any of us get so that we cannot receive  these revelations, the Lord will take us  out of the way and put someone in our  places who can. I am here today, on  borrowed time, I may say. I would  have been in the spirit world today,  mingling with the spirits in the presence  of God, had it not been for the cry of  this people for my life when I lay at the  gates of death a year ago. I have been  preserved by the power of God. How  long I shall live I do not know. It does  not make any difference to me. But  while I do live I want to do my duty,  I want the Latter-day Saints to do their  duty. Here is the Holy Priesthood in  these mountains. Their responsibility  is great and mighty. The eyes of God  and all the holy prophets are watching  over us. This is the great dispensation  that has been spoken of ever since the  world began. We are gathered to-  gether in these mountains of Israel by  the power and commandment of God.  We are doing the work of God. This is  not our home, as far as mortality is con-  cerned. We shall soon pass away. But  while here let us fill our mission. I  want to say to Brother L. Snow,  Brother M. W. Merrill, Brother J. D. T.  McAllister and Brother D. H. Cannon,  and all associated with you, carry these  things before the Lord and see for  yourselves. If you are not satisfied  with this order of things, go and ask the  Lord about it, and the Holy Ghost will  reveal to you the truth of these princi-  ples.    This is all I ought to say at this  time perhaps upon this subject.  I am glad to meet with you. I have  had a great anxiety over this matter.  I have had a great desire that I might  live to deliver these principles to the  Latter-day Saints, for they are true.  They are one step forward in the work  of the ministry and in the work of the  endowments in these temples of our  God. When you get to the last man in  the lineage, as I said before, we will  adopt that man to the Prophet Joseph,   and then the Prophet Joseph will take  care of himself with regard to where he  goes. A man may say, "I am an  Apostle, or I am a High Priest, or I am  an Elder in Israel, and if I am adopted  to my father, will it take any honor from  me?" I would say not. If Joseph Smith  was sealed to his father, with whom many  of you were acquainted, what effect will  that have upon his exaltation and glory?  None at all. Joseph Smith will hold the  keys of this dispensation to the endless  ages of eternity. It is the greatest dis-  pensation God ever gave to man, and he  was ordained before the world was to  stand in the flesh and organize this  work. He was martyred for the word  of God and testimony of Jesus, and when  he comes in the clouds of heaven he will  wear a martyr's crown. Those of you  who stand here—I do not care whether  you are Apostles or what you are—by  honoring your fathers you will not take  any honor from your heads; you  will hold the keys of the salvation of  your father's house, as Joseph Smith  does. You will lose nothing by honor-  ing your fathers and redeeming your  dead. It is a glorious work. When I  returned from England in 1841 and   heard Joseph Smith give this revelation,

 that we had power to redeem our dead,  one of the first things I thought was, "I  have a mother in the spirit world."  My  father was in the flesh. I baptized and  ordained him and brought him up to  Zion, where he is buried. But I never  saw my mother to know her. She died  when I was an infant. I had power to  seal my mother to my father. Was not  that a satisfaction? It was to me. I  have gone to work with the assistance  of my friends and redeemed my father's  and my mother's house. When I went  to inquire of the Lord how I could re-  deem my dead, while I was in St.  George, not having any of my family  there, the Lord told me to call upon the  Saints in St. George and let them  officiate for me in that temple, and it  should be acceptable unto Him.  Brother McAllister and the brethren and  sisters there have assisted me in this  work, and I felt to bless them with  every feeling of my heart. This is a  revelation to us. We can help one  another in these matters, if we have not  relatives sufficient to carry this on, and  it will be acceptable unto the Lord.    Brethren and sisters, lay these things to  heart. Let us go on with our records,  fill them up righteously before the Lord,  and carry out this principle, and the  blessings of God will attend us, and  those who redeemed will bless us in  days to come. I pray God that as a  people our eyes may be opened to see,  our ears to hear, and our hearts  to understand the great and mighty  work that rests upon our shoulders, and  that the God of heaven requires at our   hands. Great and glorious are these  principles which God has revealed to us  concerning the redemption of our dead.  I tell you when the prophets and  apostles go to preach to those who are  shut up in prison, and who have not  received the Gospel, thousands of them  will there embrace the Gospel. They  know more in that world than they do  here. I pray God that as a people we  may have power to magnify our call-  ings in this great and mighty dispensa-  tion while we dwell in the flesh, that  when our work is done we may be  satisfied with this life and this work.  This is my prayer and the desire of my  heart, in the name of Jesus Christ.  Amen. 
 INFIDELITY OF THE CHRISTIAN WORLD, ETC. 189    eyes of the nations in the hands of  the Lord, for a special purpose—to   gather the house of Israel in the lat-  ter days. These two records were  also to be made use of in order to   preach the fullness of the everlasting   Gospel to both Jew and Gentile; and  they will stand in judgment against  the generation living on the earth  when they come forth; and from the   day that Moroni gave that record into  the hands of Joseph Smith, the Lord   held him responsible for the use  which he made of it; and when he  gave him the Priesthood under the  hands of John the Baptist, and the   Apostleship under the hands of Peter,   James and John, the Lord Almighty  held him responsible unto the day   that he sealed his testimony with his  blood, for the course that he pursued   with these things. [##Joseph Smith-History 1:59##] [##Joseph Smith-History 1:68-72##] [##Doctrine and Covenants 128:20##] And he bore his  testimony, left it on record, and sealed  it with his blood, and laid down his  life, and that testimony is in force to-  day upon all the world, and will re-  main so unto the end of time. And   when I say this of Joseph Smith I  say it of every other man. President   Young has led this Church for many   years, and the Lord has held him  responsible, and will hold him so  unto the day of his death, for the  course pursued by him while con-  ducting the affairs of his Church   and kingdom, and also for the use   he makes of the holy Priesthood and  the keys of the kingdom. So also  with his Counselors, the Twelve  Apostles, and every one of us; we  shall all be held accountable to the   day of our death, and we shall have  to give an account before the God of  heaven when we go into the spirit  world and meet him there; for the   use of this Priesthood, and the keys   of the kingdom, which have been  established on the earth for the last   time, have been committed into the   hands of this people, and God will   hold the whole of us responsible for   the use we make of the blessings,   privileges and powers which we enjoy   in connection therewith. The eyes  of God and his angels, and of every   man who dwells in the celestial world   are watching us, and the course we   pursue.    We are gathered together here as   a people; we have been in these  mountains a good while, and for a   good many years we have been or-  ganized as a Church and kingdom,  in this last age, in this dispensa-  tion of the fullness of times; and  now the question with me is—Are   we living up to our privileges? Are   we performing the work required at  our hands? Can we, as a people,  claim the blessings of the Gospel of   Christ, the blessings of the celestial   law and of the celestial kingdom   of God? Can we claim these things   at the hands of our heavenly Father   unless we keep his commandments?   This is a question that we want to   take home to ourselves. If we are  not keeping the commands of the   Lord can we claim his blessings?   We can not; and this is matter  for reflection for the Latter-day  Saints.    It may be asked—What are the  commandments of the Lord? Many  of them are contained in these re-  cords, the Bible, Book of Mormon  and Book of Doctrine and Cove-  nants; and we have the living ora-  cles with us, and have had from the  commencement. The Lord will never   leave his kingdom without a lawgiver,   leader, president, or some power to   direct the affairs of his Church on  the earth, for the reason that it is  the dispensation of the fullness of   times, in which God has set up a   kingdom which is to be an everlasting   kingdom, and to whose dominion   there will be no end; that kingdom  will not be given into the hands of

Price One Penny.    DISCOURSE BY PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF.    THE following discourse was delivered by President Wilford Woodruff at  the General Conference of the Church, in the Tabernacle, Salt Lake City,   April 5, 1896:    The highest calling the Lord ever called any human being to, in any   age of the world, has been to receive the Holy Priesthood, with its keys   and powers, and to be called to go forth to the inhabitants of the earth   and teach them the principles of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and to qualify   and prepare them for a part in the first resurrection and to go back into   the presence of God, their Creator, to dwell in glory worlds without end.   The Lord bestowed that blessing, that Priesthood and that power in the   beginning of creation. Father Adam was called of God and ordained to   the fullness of the Melchisedek Priesthood--ordained to the highest office  and gift of God to man on the earth. Adam bestowed that blessing upon   seven of his sons--Seth, Enos, Jared, Canaan, Mahalaleel, Enoch and   Methuselah. They were all ordained High Priests by their father Adam,   and possessed the privilege and the right to understand the Gospel of   Jesus Christ and to give it to the human family, so that they might   qualify and prepare themselves for eternal life. [##Doctrine and Covenants 107:53##] In tracing the history   of the dealings of God with men from that day to this, we find the Lord   has in various dispensations and times given unto the sons of men that   blessing. Israel had it in the beginning, from Abraham, Isaac and Jacob   down, and until Moses, who traveled with the children of Israel forty   years in the wilderness. They had the gifts and graces of that Priesthood   bestowed upon them, and they had the privilege of magnifying their   callings and preparing themselves for eternal life. But Israel would not   accept the Melchisedek Priesthood, and therefore it was taken from them,   and the Lesser Priesthood was conferred upon them while they traveled [##Doctrine and Covenants 84:23-26##]

 190 JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.    any other people, but it will be given   to the Saints of the Most High, and  they will possess it for ever and   ever.    Now, brethren and sisters, here  comes a question in my mind, this  morning, which I think we ought  to bring home to ourselves, and that  is—Are we, as a people, doing our   duty in keeping the law and com-  mandments of God, and the cove-  nants which we have made? If we   are we are justified, and we have a  claim upon the Holy Spirit and   upon the blessing and approbation   of God. Many things are required   at the hands of the Latter-day   Saints, and there is not one of us  who has a lease of his life. The  Elders of this Church are passing   away, and almost every Conference  we look around and find that some-  body has left us; and it will be but  a short time before many of us who  are here to-day will have closed our  labors in the flesh, and we shall have  passed to the other side of the vail,   and it is important to us all that we  should do what is required of us.   What we find to do to-day we should  not put off till to-morrow.    The question may arise in some  minds—What is required of the   Latter-day Saints? I will tell you  some things that are required of us.  The Lord requires us to pay our  Tithing; and another thing is that  we go to and build the Temple in  this city; whether we do it or not   it is required of us, and if we fail,   we, in my view, shall be under con-  demnation. I consider that the   building of Temples is one of the  important things required by the   Lord of the Latter-day Saints in  the dispensation of the fullness of   times, that we may go into those  Temples and not only redeem the  living but redeem our dead. We   have been a good many years here   in the valleys of the mountains,   and we have not yet got a Temple   finished to the name of the Lord.   We have one pretty well forward   in St. George, and I am very glad   of it; but we want one here. We   have got the foundation laid; it   has been standing a good many   years, and I think that we should  go to and finish it, and do what we   can to redeem our dead. This is  among the things for which I think   we shall be held responsible. Very   many of us in this Church and  kingdom have been gathered, as   the Prophet has said, one of a family  and two of a city, and many of our   progenitors, now in the spirit world,   never saw the face of an Apostle,   Prophet, or inspired man, and they  are shut up in prison. Joseph Smith,   Heber Kimball, Geoege A. Smith,  and thousands of the Elders of Israel  may preach to those spirits, and they   may receive the testimonies which   the Elders bear; but the Elders will   not baptize believers there; there is  no baptism in the spirit world any  more than there is any marrying and  giving in marriage. All these things  have to be done this side of the vail,  in the flesh. God is no respecter of  persons; he will not give privileges   to one generation and withhold them   from another; and the whole human  family, from father Adam down to   our day, have got to have the privi-  lege, somewhere, of hearing the Gos-  pel of Christ; and the generations   that have passed and gone without  hearing that Gospel in its fullness,   power and glory, will never be held   responsible by God for not obeying   it, neither will he bring them under  condemnation for rejecting a law   they never saw or understood; and  if they live up to the light they had   they are justified so far, and they  have to be preached to in the spirit   world. But nobody will baptize

 306 LATTER-DAY SAINTS' MILLENNIAL STAR.    in the wilderness. It is not necessary for me to spend time in tracing this   Priesthood through the six thousand years that have past and gone; but   it has been manifest in every age and dispensation when God has had   prophets and apostles on the earth. Jesus Christ came into the world in   the meridian of time. He was the Great High Priest to Israel. He was   the Son of God, the Savior of the world. He chose His Apostles, He   organized His Church. He bestowed upon these Apostles all the gifts and   graces belonging to the apostleship. In that dispensation it seems that   they were called to lay down their lives for the word of God and testimony   of Jesus Christ. The Savior himself was put to death. The Apostles   were all, with one exception, put to death in their day and time, until   finally the Priesthood was taken home to God, and remained there for a   length of time. But my views are that whenever the inhabitants of the   earth were prepared for the Gospel of Jesus Christ and the power of the   Priesthood, it has been bestowed upon them.    In the days of the Savior and His Apostles, John the Revelator, while   upon the Isle of Patmos, gave an outline of great events which were to   transpire in the last dispensation of the fulness of times. Other prophets   and apostles, who spoke as they were moved upon by the Holy Ghost,   left on the pages of history a record of what the Lord would do in the   last dispensation. Among the great events that the Revelator saw was   the one described in the 14th chapter of his Revelation, and which is often   quoted by our elders, because it is very applicable.    And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the ever-  lasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every   nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people,    Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour   of his judgment is come.    If this revelation had not been fulfilled, neither you nor I would be here   to-day, this Tabernacle would not be erected, this city would be still part   of the Great American Desert, as we found it; but in the fulfillment of   the revelations of God, these things have been done and some of us have   lived to see them. The angel of God did visit Joseph Smith, the Prophet   of God, who was raised up by the power of God as a prophet, seer and   revelator, and who organized the Church of Jesus Christ in the earth.  From that day until this the work has progressed and the Gospel has  been preached. The Holy Ghost has been with the people. The Lord  Almighty has set His hand to carry out the great programme--to establish  the Zion of God in the earth and to prepare the people for the coming of  the Son of Man.    These are my views with regard to the calling of men in this dispensa-  tion. Gold and silver may pass away; houses and lands may perish; all   temporal matters will pass away; but the Priesthood never, salvation   never, the kingdom of God never, and prophecy will never fall unfulfilled.   We have had all Apostles now for upwards of sixty years. Many have died   and gone to the other side of the veil; and those upon whom God bestowed   the glory and power of the organization of the Church have sealed their   testimony with their blood, as the ancient Apostles did. They have gone

 INFIDELITY OF THE CHRISTIAN WORLD ETC. 191    them there, and somebody has got  to administer for them by proxy here   in the flesh, that they may be judged   according to men in the flesh and  have part in the first resurrection.    This, in my view, is the work that   is required at the hands of the Lat-  ter-day Saints, and when we get   through I think we will find this to  be true. And if there is anything   I desire to live for on the earth, or  that I have desired, it has been to  get a record of the genealogy of my  fathers, that I might do something  for them before I go hence into the  spirit world. Until within a few   years past it has seemed as if every  avenue has been closed to obtaining  such records; but the Lord has moved  upon the inhabitants of this nation,   and thousands of them are now labor-  ing to trace the genealogical descent   of the Puritan fathers, those who  landed at Plymouth Rock, and whose  descendants built up New England.   Their lineages are coming to light,   and we are gradually obtaining ac-  cess to them, and by this means we  shall be enabled to do something  towards the salvation of our dead.    These are some of the things upon  my mind that I wished to speak to   you about. And now let me ask—  Have we a right to our endowments   and to the ordinances and blessings   of the Church and kingdom of God,   unless we fulfill the law of God. It   seems to me many times, that there  is a darkness and a lack of faith even  among the Latter-day Saints, and  that as we grow older we grow colder,   and as we advance towards the wind-  ing-up scene it seems as though we  have almost lost sight of our calling,  of the object of our being gathered  together, and the purposes which   God requires at our hands. There  is a good deal for us to do if we   build up Zion; and if we do that and   sanctify ourselves before the Lord,   it has got to be done through obedi-  ence to the commandments of the   Lord. The Lord has commanded   us, and we have got to obey his  commandments if we receive the  blessings of obedience. Our num-  bers are not great, and compared  with the whole of the inhabitants   of the earth I do not expect that   the number of the Latter-day   Saints will ever be very great; yet  the Lord has promised that the   little one shall become a thousand,  and the small one a strong nation;   and out of the house of Israel and  those from among the Gentiles who  obey the Gospel, God will raise up a  nation, and they will have power  and strength in the earth. But  when we compare the Saints in this   or any other age with the surround-  ing world, their numbers are few.  I do not know why it is that so few   of the inhabitants of the earth take   any interest in their eternal welfare.  The whole human family, heathen,  pagan, Christian and Jew, know that   this is not their home, and that all   have got to die, they can not escape   the law of death; even if translated,  as some were anciently, they have to  undergo a change equivalent to death.   Then why is it there is so little in-  terest throughout the world with   regard to a future state and to eternal  matters? The few who show they   have an interest in these things, and   who have gathered together to these  valleys of the mountains, have need  of faith; we stand in need of prayer,  we stand in need of the Holy Ghost,  and of the inspiration of the Al-  mighty to dictate and direct us, and  unless we possess and enjoy these  things we become barren and un-  fruitful before the Lord.    Now, whatever the Lord requires   at our hands, he does not require   anything of us that we can not per-  form. We can obey his command-

Therefore, I say to the Latter-day Saints, we   are in this organization to-day. I do not pretend to say exactly the num-  ber that we have in the Priesthood; but we have from fifteen to twenty   thousand Elders in this Church; we have many various organizations of   the Priesthood, and churches are organized throughout the world as far   as we have had an opportunity. I have been called, these Apostles have,   many of the Elders have, to go to the nations of the earth and the islands  of the sea to preach the Gospel to our fellow-men. What greater calling   can any man have on the face of the earth than to hold in his hands   power and authority to go forth and administer in the ordinances of   salvation? Do we prize these things in their fullness? I do not think   we do. Nevertheless, so far we have been enabled to maintain our posi-  tion, and to go forth and fulfill our missions as far as we have had time   and opportunity. Certainly there has been nothing in this work that I   have had greater consolation in than in preaching the Gospel to my fellow-  men and in administering unto them the ordinances of the house of God,   both for the living and the dead. I may say the same with regard to my   brethren who are called to perform those ordinances.    There was something said yesterday by the brethren with regard to our   sons and our missionaries abroad. I will say for myself--and when I say   it for myself I think I speak for a great many others--there is no joy that   I have ever had that has been greater than that which has come to me in  having sons receive the Holy Priesthood and go forth and administer   among the nations of the earth the ordinances of life and salvation. It   is a glorious gift to the sons of men. It is what men have not enjoyed   before us for the last eighteen hundred years almost. Then should we not  prize these things? Yes, we should. The Lord, in the dispensation of His   providences, has given to us an army of sons and daughters, and our sons   are called to go to the nations of the earth. We want to instill into their   minds the importance of these blessings to the inhabitants of the earth   and the saving of souls from sin. You give unto any soul the principles   of life and salvation and administer these ordinances to him, and you   become an instrument in the hands of God in the salvation of that soul.   There is nothing given to the children of men that is equal to it.    This is our position to-day in these mountains. We have been led here   by the power of God--led by a prophet, seer and revelator, President   Brigham Young, who was full of the Holy Ghost and full of revelation,  appointed of the Lord, and who magnified his calling up to the hour of   his death. We came here and found a barren desert. From that day till   this it has been a continual growth and increase, until we have arrived at  a point where we have a tabernacle as a "shadow in the daytime from the   heat  *  *  *  and for a covert from storm and from rain." These   things have all been prophesied of thousands of years ago by the ancient  prophets and patriarchs who foresaw the work of God in the last days.    I want to say a few words to our young men who are rising up among

There is  no man or woman so poor but what   he or she can obey the Gospel; they   can go forth and be baptized for the  remission of their sins, and if they  keep the commandments of the Lord  he will put into their hands power  and means to fulfill that which is   required of them.    I hope, brethren and sisters, that   while we are together at this Con-  ference, we shall have prayerful   hearts, and that the Spirit of the  Lord may be poured out upon us;   that President Young may have   strength of body, and that the Spirit  of God may rest upon him to such  an extent that he may be able to   give the Latter-day Saints such in-  struction as he may desire; and that  the Apostles and Elders who may be  called upon to speak may be made  the instruments in the hands of the  Lord in conveying his word to the  people, and that we may be united to-  gether.    Somebody or other has got to   build up Zion; somebody has got to   build Temples, and to go into them   and attend to the ordinances therein.  The Lord has said that he will come  and visit the earth, but before he  does come the people have got to  be pure. The Lord Jesus has de-  clared that he will come and reign  on the earth, and if you read the  Book of Doctrine and Covenants   you will find numerons predictions  in regard to his coming, such as—  "I come quickly," "I come at an  hour ye think not," "My coming  is at the door," "I come as a thief   in the night," "I come in an hour   when you are not looking for me,"   and "Blessed is he who is looking for   the coming of our Lord and Savior   Jesus Christ." I say that through-  out the whole of the Scriptures—  the Old and New Testament, the   Book of Mormon, and the Book of  Doctrine and Covenants, the second   coming of the Lord is frequently   referred to; and has the Lord,   promised these things without in-  tending to fulfill them? No, he has   not, they will be fulfilled. But be-  fore Christ comes, a people have got  to be prepared by being sanctified   before the Lord. Temples have got   to be built; Zion has got to be built   up; there must be a place of safety  for the people of God while his judg-  ments are abroad in the earth, for the  judgments of God will visit the earth,   there is no mistake about that, the  revelations are full of promises to this   effect, and as the Lord has declared  it, he will not fail in keeping his word.    Brethren and sisters, let us search   the revelations of God; let us look   to ourselves, and understand the   spirit by which we are governed  and controlled in our labors and  callings. We are called to a great  calling. The greatest calling with   which any people can be called is   to have placed in their hands the   Gospel of Christ, and the power to  build up his kingdom upon the   earth. The Lord has chosen the   weak things of the world to con-  found the world, and things that are  nought to bring to nought things  that are. He has done this in   every age of the world, and he has   done it in our day and generation;  and he will hold us responsible for  the use we make of the holy   Priesthood, the ordinances of his  house and the power that is put into   our hands to accomplish the work of   God, and to build Temples to his   name. If we do not do these things  I think that we shall be under con-  demnation before the Lord, and that  we shall suffer for it.    I pray God, my heavenly Father,

They have got to take the places of their fathers, the same as   the sons of Adam had in his day and generation. A great responsibility  rests upon them. The Lord requires at the hands of our sons that they   shall bear off this kingdom of our God while they dwell in the flesh, that  they may be justified. The Lord told Oliver Cowdery, "And if it so be   that you should labor all your days in crying repentance unto this   people, and bring save it be one soul unto me, how great shall be your   joy with him in the kingdom of my Father." It requires light, knowledge,   and understanding; it requires the spirit and power of God for us to   comprehend our position, our blessings, and our gifts that God has placed   upon us. I feel to rejoice and thank God myself that I have lived to see   what I do in these valleys of the mountains; that I have lived to see   these multitudes that fill these tabernacles and temples and labor here   in the building up of the kingdom of God. The Lord has been very mer-  ciful to me, and my life has been preserved to pass through these things,   and I still remain in the midst of this people. I have to acknowledge the   hand of God in the whole of it. I suppose you have to do so with regard   to your lives. The fact is, there is not a blessing that God has bestowed   upon us from the beginning but has been the gift of God. We should   understand this. We have preached the Gospel to every nation, kin-  dred, tongue, and people, as far as the Lord has opened doors for us   and we have had the privilege of going. Still the world to-day is full of   people who have not heard the Gospel of Jesus Christ; and while the   Priesthood rests upon our shoulders we are still under obligation and are   still held responsible for the salvation of the children of men, as far as we   have the privilege of bestowing these gifts upon the sons and daughters of  Adam. Only think that by embracing the Gospel of Christ we can become  heirs of God and joint heirs with Jesus Christ, that we can have part in   the first resurrection, and come forth out of our graves and be clothed with   glory, immortality, and eternal lives, and pass into the presence of God   and the Lamb and dwell with them eternally in the heavens! Who com-  prehends this? Do the inhabitants of the earth? They do not. Satan   has warred against us from the organization of this Church, to try and   destroy this people; but so far we have been preserved. We should be   thankful for these blessings. I realize myself that we are dependent upon   the Lord in all things. The Lord is our preserver. He is the author of   our salvation. Jesus Christ has laid down His life to redeem us by His   blood, and through that we have these blessings bestowed upon us.    Among other things, we live in a generation in which the Lord has   enabled us to rear several temples--some in these mountains and some   before we came here; and hundreds and thousands of people go into these   temples to redeem their dead. This is a blessing the Latter-day Saints   should prize. It is a duty that is required at our hands to do what we can in   this direction. It is a blessing that the inhabitants of the earth have not   had for centuries until this dispensation. I hope that no man who has got  a record of his father's house will go down to his grave without having

 learned that the "path of duty  is the path of safety."    If you had asked me 'when  it would be convenient for me  to go,' I certainly would have  asked for a few months time,  but inasmuch as you have made  the appointment I will do my  utmost to fill it.    I had my barn, stables and about  twenty (20) tons of hay burned last  December. I wish to put up  another barn; I have three (3)  small fields which I desire to  fence, and my house to plaster  and finish -- all before I go --   so that my property may be  secure, and my family comfort-  able whilst I am absent.    With the blessings of God, I expect  to accomplish all this ere I depart,  and I have faith ^that^ the Lord will  open up my way, so that I  can accomplish that which  I so much desire to.    I earnestly ask your blessings  upon my labors so that I may  not fail.    In humility, I am Your  Brother in the Gospel  David Spilsbury    Toquerville, Washington Co.    P. S.

 LATTER-DAY SAINTS' MILLENNIAL STAR. 309    attended to this work. How would I feel, after living as long as I have,   with the privileges I have had of going into these temples, to go into the   spirit world without having done this work? I meet my father's house, I   meet my mother's house, I meet my progenitors, and they are shut up in   prison; I held the keys of their salvation, and yet did nothing for them;   what would be my feelings, or what would be their feelings toward me?   They would not like it. I feel that while the Lord has given us this bles-  sing, every man and woman in this Church that has any faith at all in God   and in the Gospel should attend to this duty. Jesus Christ, while His   body lay in the tomb, went and preached to the spirits in prison, that were   drowned in the days of Noah by the flood, because of their wickedness and  abominations. [##1 Peter 3:19-20##] They had been in prison for a long time, and He went and   preached to them, "that they might be judged according to men in the   flesh, but live according to God in the spirit." [##1 Peter 4:6##] Joseph Smith, Hyrum Smith,   David Patten, and the Apostles and Elders who have been true and faith-  ful unto death have also gone to the spirits in prison in their day and time   and preached the Gospel of Christ to their fathers' houses and to those who are shut up in prison, and they are laboring there for the salvation of   the children of men. These are glorious principles -- principles which the   Latter-day Saints should not neglect while they have the privilege and   power. As I said in the beginning, there is no calling a man can be called   to any greater than to have this right and privilege to go forth and save   the souls of men -- save them by preaching the Gospel to them, by adminis-  tering the ordinances of the house of God to them, that they may be pre-  pared themselves to go into the kingdom of heaven and into a celestial   glory. There are three glories. Paul in speaking upon that subject said,  "There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another   glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory. So   also is the resurrection of the dead." [##1 Corinthians 15:40-41##] These glories over-shadow the whole   human family. Now, how much better it is for a man to receive these   ordinances, that he may go where God and Christ dwell, which is the   highest glory! But Jesus said in His day, "Strait is the gate, and   narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it;"  while "broad is the way that leadeth to destruction, and many there be   which go in thereat." [##Matthew 7:13-14##] I think many times that we ourselves do not prize   the blessings that we enjoy and that are within our reach. Our hearts   should be set upon the building up of the kingdom of God, the Zion of   God, and the work of God, while we are here and have power to perform   these things. It is our duty as the Presidency and as Apostles, not only   to labor ourselves, but to send forth the Elders of Israel to the nations of  the earth to proclaim the Gospel. Doors are open to-day among many of  the nations for the spread of the Gospel of Christ, and to bring the people   unto Christ, that they may receive these blessings.    Brethren and sisters, this is the way I feel this morning. Of all people   under heavens we should be the best, the most righteous, and the most true   and faithful to God and to our fellow-men. We should be true and faith-  ful to the Holy Priesthood while we have it resting upon us, and true to   our labors. I rejoice at our condition to-day. I rejoice at the peace that

 310 LATTER-DAY SAINTS' MILLENNIAL STAR.    has come unto us by the power and blessing of God. I rejoice at the   change that is taking place in the world. We are visited now by hundreds  of people from the nations of the earth. They are coming to behold the   glory of Zion. They come to enquire at our hands concerning various   matters, and there is a very different feeling to what there was in former   days toward us. Brother John W. Taylor referred to our going to St.   Louis and to Chicago. Yes, I recollect very well when we went into Jackson   County, Missouri. My labors there have been alluded to. When I went on   my first mission in 1834, I had to go through Jackson County on my way to   Arkansas. It was just after our brethren had been driven out. I had to   go and hide in the cornfields and in the brush during the day, and walk   along in the night, till I got through that country, for the lives of myself   and companion were in danger there. The last time I went there, the Mayor of Independence came out to meet us with a fine carriage.He had   but one arm having lost the other in the army, but he gave us that arm and   made us welcome. I could not help but feel the difference between then and   when I went through there as a missionary. There is a change taking place.  Zion is going to rise and shine, and the glory of God will rest upon her.  This people, if they do their duty, will fulfil and carry out these great   principles, and the eyes of the world will be turned toward Zion, and men  will come to enquire concerning the things of the kingdom of God. We are  in a good condition. We are blessed of the Lord. The Latter-day Saints   have never been so well off temporally. Go into the houses of the Latter-  day Saints, and you will find them in a better position than they have ever   been before. These are the blessings of God, and we should prize these   things and give God the glory for them, while we try to do our duty and   magnify our calling. I want to say that I am in for salvation and for   eternal life. I have labored for that since I was a boy. I have desired the   gift, and graces, and blessings manifest in the days of Jesus and His   Apostles. In my childhood I prayed God that I might live to see a prophet  or somebody who could teach me the principles I read in the New Testa-  ment. The clergy of the day did not do it. Nobody around there appeared  to believe in such things. Well, I have lived to see prophets and apostles;  I have lived to travel with them and to unite with them in the kingdom   of God. I have been in the apostleship fifty-eight years; I have been in   the Church sixty-three years. My whole life almost has been spent in this  Church; and from the time I came into the Church I went on missions   and have never ceased altogether from that day to this. I have always   rejoiced in this, and do to-day. When I die and lay down my body, I   do not want anybody to rise up and say that I have neglected my duty   in trying to give him salvation as far as I could. I have always rejoiced   in preaching the Gospel; I have always rejoiced in administering the ordi-  nances of life and salvation at home and abroad, because I have known that   this was the work of God, and I know it is to-day.    I want to say now to the rising generation, gird up the loins of your   minds, prepare yourselves, and realize you have a mission before you.   Who are going to bear this kingdom off when we go to the grave? To   whom does the God of Israel look to do this? He looks to our sons and

There is nothing   like it on earth. You may get the riches of the world; they pass away;   but eternal life, celestial glory, a place with the righteous after resurrec-  tion, with immortal bodies, are worth more than all this world can give.  I have confidence to believe that the Latter-day Saints will carry out these  principles and magnify their calling before the Lord. I have hopes that   our sons and daughters will do the same.    Brethren and sisters, I say, God bless you. I am glad to meet with you.  I rejoice in the Gospel, in the kingdom of God, and in the Holy Priesthood.   I pray God to bless you, to open your eyes to see, and ears to hear, and   your hearts to understand. I pray God to open your understanding, that   you may comprehend the value and blessing of the Gospel that you have  received and of the blessings of these temples and tabernacles in the   midst of which you have the privilege of dwelling and receiving the   ordinances of God. I pray that we may pursue that course that when  we get on the other side of the veil we shall be satisfied with our   record. We will find our history and our record there in the great library  of the celestial kingdom of our God, and we will know what we have   been doing in this life. If we do anything that is wrong we will be sorry for  it. We should repent of wrong and try to do better. I pray that the   Spirit of God may be with us to guide and direct us in our labors until we  get through here, then when we pass away we may be received in the   kingdom of God. We shall rejoice if we do right; for our eyes have not   seen, our ears have not heard, and it has never entered into the hearts of  the children of men the glory that lies before the sons and daughters of   Adam. It is hidden from our eyes to-day, and will never be open to us   until we enter into the presence of God and the Lamb. Amen. 
 Toquerville. June 2nd, 1897.    Pres. Wilford Woodruff,  Salt Lake City Utah.  Dear Pres. Woodruff:    Great pleasure is aforded me, in being  able to accept my mission to Samoa. You are aware  no doubt, I was attending the Academy when  I recieved my call and also from which institution  I'm a graduate. Inability posesses me when  I attempt the expression of happiness I feel in  being called to be a representative of the   Gospel of life and salvation. It matters little  to me where the vineyard of the Lord is. I'll  go where I'm called with a determination to  bring glory to God and my fellow townfold and  relatives. I realize the Samoans have souls to  save the same as the English or Germans.    Will be in Salt Lake City on the 15th or 16th of  July to be set apart for my mission in con-  nection with Bro. Ed. Smart of Provo.    Hoping all plans will be carried out;    I'm your brother    Chauncy Spilsbury.    Wm A Bringhurst  Bishop
