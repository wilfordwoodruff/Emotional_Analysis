 principles of the gospel and some have already applied for baptism -- One of these inquirers I would like to make you and the brethren at home nearer acquainted with.  He is Mr. Mousa Tannus, a man of high cultivation and much influence among his people.  He knows perfectly besides his own tongue (the Arabic) Turkish, French, English and Greek.  A few years ago, during a persecution which the Protestants suffered in Syria, he rendered eminent service in inducing the Turkish government to remove the instigators of the persecution from their of- fices.  I am now almost a daily guest at the house of this gentleman, and he has intro- duced me to ma^n^y people here in Jaffa and also to a relative of his, the English Proconsul of Jerusalem, thus giving me a chance to bear my humble testimony in many places where I otherwise would have found no enterance.  Yesterday I was called to a prominent family and asked to lay my hands on and pray for a sick  child.  I did so, and hope God will answer my prayer, to the honor of His name.  --Now Mr.  Tannus has asked me, if it would not be con- sidered improper for him to put himself in connection with the brethren at home by ENDENTRY  him, I think not.  I suppose, on the contrary,  that, if he would find time to write to you about the country here, its inhabitants and prospects of evangelisations, it would be per- used with interest, and that you would also find time to send him a friendly an- swer, encouraging him to go forward and take the step fully out, as Saint of God.  For a man in his position, it is no small thing to become a "Mormon" in this country, and I  do not know, whether the Spirit can prevail over him or not.  But he is certainly very "nearly persuaded".  A word from home might materially assist him.  I would also be very glad, if some one at home would be kind enough to present him with President G. Q. Cannon's Life of Joseph Smith.  Because that is the very book which he now aught to read.  I  have not got it myself, or, I would gladly have given it to him.  I have given him "The Voice of Warning" and "Orson Pratt's works" I would also like to have the "Deseret News"  come to him.  If the News Company will send him the Weekly for one year, that can be charged to my account with the News.  His address is: Mousa Tannus, Esq.  Jaffa, Palestine, Syria.

Your humble Servant J M Sjodahl ENDENTRY      could I have even dreamed that I should now be writing to the Honorable President of the latter day Saints of Salt Lake City Utah which fact I look upon as being of a predestinated character inasmuch as am made to feel that I am in duty bound to be one of the Instruments in the forwarding to a certain extent the cause of the latter day saints in Palestine relative to the speedy Advent of our Lord Jesus and the necessity of true repentance which I will endeavour by Gods' help to infuse into the minds of the natives upon every available opportunity: as regard myelf I dont see as yet the necessity of baptism though on the other hand I think it is right that enquirers should be baptised in due time in conformity with the ordinances of the Church of the latter day Saints.

Being in this country,  and having had during a long life  much experience among my country- men, if I am allowed to make any  suggestion as to the means that  should be adopted inorder to secure  success here I would as one important  requisite mentioned that the Church  should found here in Jaffa, a  Centrum for their missionary work, a lot should be bought to sufficient  for the erection of a meeting house  or a school inorder that the  people might thereby be brought  into close contact with your people.   ENDENTRY  easy to reach the people, then if  possible a tract of land should be  procured large enough for establishing  a Colony of Saints. There are already  ^a^ few who express themselves as ready  for baptism and more would be  likely to follow when it become known  that the work of the Church was  really established here and the colo- nization would, I have no doubt,  in course of time not only be the  means of doing much spiritual  good but also more than pay its  expenses.   I suggest that Jaffa should be  the centrum for missionary work and why an eventual colony not  far from here.   Nablos (the capital  of Samaria) and Gaza the most  Southern City of Palestine and on  ENDENTRY  already several Colonies round about  here some of which cultivate yearly  vast tract of land with vines and  there is no doubt that the same will  secure for them in due time immense  profits.

The air outside the City  particularly in the South, is very  healthy. There is another point  which in my ju of great importance to a prosperous  mission work among the people  here. If you could by any means  help a few of the natives over to Utah  where they might find some work to do  and in the mean time receive  full instructions in the principles  of the Gospel, some of them might  by the help of God be of the greatest  use in spreading the light of truth  in the interior of the Country among  the Villagers working under the  direction of your own missionaries  from Utah. What an unspeakable  pleasure it would give me to see  some of these men return and  bring about a thorough conversion  of some so called Christians to  know the true God and seek  repentance as I have already ENDENTRY  in whom I have observed such a  great change since the Visits of  M testimony he has born of the truth  of the Gospel.

Our saints, I urged, need  visiting and encourageing and besides I would have a  better chance of mastering the language. And again  there is an old sister in Haifa who is desireious  of helping the work of the Lord and has promiced to  pay to any one, authorized to receive the same, one thous- and franks to be used in the Turkish Mission  besides a years' tithing. But Prest Young is cautious  a bout accepting this money as the sister's children  are not members of the church and they might  raise some serious objections and, it may be, cause us some trouble. Since my letter I sugested  it would be a good idea to visit this sister and as- certain just how matters stand, and if it would  be unwise to accept the money we can explain  to the good sister, and on the other hand, if every  thing is all right we can receive the money. President Young thinks the idea a good one  and I have, therefore, decided to leave Constanti- nople in a few days. But before starting I thought  to pen you a few lines relative to the out look in  this part of the vineyard, and, at the same time,  to render an account of the funds sent here  ENDENTRY  would not be out of the way.   regret, you have received Elder Herman's report of  our failure in accomplishing what at one time  seemed so certain. But as I dident arrive here  untill after Bro H's failure and as I dont know  what he reported I have nothing much to write  on this point. And as opinions are cheap it may  be wisdom for me to keep mine to myself, but  what I would like to say is this. That Elder Stauffer's  going home, as he did, just when success was  a bout to crown his labors and leaveing inexperienced  Elders, Elders unacquainted with the maners and  language of the people, was rather a mistake. And might I offer a suggestion. I would say  send an Elder to this mission every six months, so that in the future there will always be some  one here who can speak the language for before  we are acquainted with the language we can  accomplish nothing. I have great faith in the  Turkish people if we could only reach them and  I dont think the day is far distant when things  will be so changed that we can reach them  just as good as we can any other people and our labors will be attended with greater  success. Even now our Elders can go and come  just as they please and can preach just whare  and when they please, and I beleave the Government  will yet grant us the rights we are so anxious  to obtain. I dont think it would be wisdom to  try to do anything more regarding the publishing  at present. It would be better to wait untill next  year when I hope to be able to speak the language ENDENTRY    us permission to publish our tracts in this lan- guage I decided to have some published any how  for I thought by useing discretion we could circulate  a few thousand a moung the people with whome we  came daily in contact with out running any un- due risk and, at the same time, keep the work al- ready begun slowly moveing a long untill such  time when we can enjoy more freedom. Accordingly I got questions from a Vienna house  and place a trial order for two thousand tracts printed  in the Armena Turkish language. The price, 8 1/2 pounds, I considered very expensive but it was the best  I could do. After placeing my order, I learned that  all second class mail was subject to examination  by Turkish officials and when found to contain  something the Government would not sanction  it was confiscated. Now the only ^way^ I could do was to  write and order our pamphlets sent by letter  postage at an extra cost of 5 1/2 pounds. This makes our tracts very expensive still I think the money  thus spent has been well invested.   will be easly understood.

President Brigham Young had  prev to assist us by sending some elders and also with means for the purpose of publishing tracts, etc, both of which  are much in need of to be successful in spreading the Gospel among these anxious, but benighted peple. In regards to the subject of procureing Government grant which will privilage us to preach and circulate tracts openly etc, I can give no reliable answere as to what it will cost and how it may be obtained, as that can only be learned at the capitol. I have, however, lately been informed of some points which may modify the ideas conveyed in my recent letters to Pres. Young concuring the matter. For some time the American Protestants exerted themsel and to accuse us before the government to the end that they might banish, or otherwise get rid of us, but as they did not succeede in getting the other Christian sects to join them in their false accusation (which was neccessary to take effect,) they had to drop their plan, and thus we are left at liberty to continue our labors as before. The point I wish to make is this, that all the different Protestant sects work on one  government grant, which is possessed by the English Epis- copal Church. This grant privileges all Non-Catholic ENDENTRY  previding they can make such arrangements with the Episcopal Church, which holds the grant. This, then, is one way for pocureing a right to poselyte in Turkey. To obtain a grant directly from the government (from what I learn) will require considerable means (the am't cannot be asertained un- til the task is undertaken, as bribery is the common law.) The priveleges of a grant are effectual throughout the empire so far as preaching is concurned, but special grants are required for building churches or school: hence I conclude that for  col tracts, I learn that all that is necessary is to make arrange- ments with some printer, who, if there be nothing to interfere with Turkish politics, receives the right for printting and distributing (tracts) may then be done without any danger of trouble as far a the government is concurned, unless stired up by Christians. This printing also can only be attended to in Constantinople...   calling local brethern in to the ministry, were favorably accept- ed. There are several good faithful brethern who are becomming well informed in the principles of the Gospel. To have one of them accompany each of the Utah elders will certainly prove a great help.

They pay a tithe of all their earnings weekly or monthly as the case may be. There is a good feeling generally among us and thus we hope to be able to teach by example as well as by pre- cept. ...Though none of the saints here are wealthy, they are all industrious and as yet only one has been in need of a little assistence. It is strange to say that all of our members in this branch are males and most of them heads of families. We have no poper place to receive  necessity of  conform to the customs of the Orient. We are often envited out to teach at evenings which is the only opertunity offorded for ladies to hear our teaching (probably lady missionaries could do much good.)   when I heard from them last.

These bretheren, although faith- ful man, are, it seems to me, entirely nonsuited for this peculiar field of labor. There is a spirit of selfsufficiency prevailing among the people of California, and San Franciscan in particular, that causes people to look with supercilious contempt upon any man attempting to teach or preach that does not come up to their standard of intelligence. A man, laboring here as Missionary, needs much wisdom and some experience, or else, he is simpl- ly "walked over". Bro. Williams would do as a valuable assistant to a President of the Mission that would be able to carry on a vigorous cor- respondence with scattered members throughout California, engage the attention of men of edu- cation and refinement, and exercise a kind of magnetic influence upon the public meetings of the Saints.

But the specimens in Drawing and Penman- ship from the Latterday Saint College; and  Bro.

The large majority of the Saints, 43 registered, are people that have drifted away from Zion for some reason or another, and are being labored with according to circumstances, to bring them to a realisation of the requirements of the Gospel. The "Josephites" have been exercising a most per- nicious influence among them formerly. There are several people investigating the  principles of Mormonism, and the attendances of strangers at our meetings is gradually in creasing. It will be a hard pull, financially, for this Branch to raise their monthly rent after the Midwinter Fair is over, as the con- tributions from visiting Saints from Utah and Sister Caine's Tithing will then cease, all of which have been the main source of income thus far.

The church- works made a fine display though, and were assisted  in that by the grand picture of the First Presidency, the  large picture of the Temple, representations in frame  of the Utah Sugar Works,  and a large album with the portraits of our Leaders. All these furnished me abundant material for ex- planations and testimony. Notwithstanding the as yet incomplete representation of our al status, visitors commenced to increase daily in numbers and began to manifest greater interest either pro or con as time went on.

I greatly fear that my letter of the 8th to you, has con- veyed a wrong impression in relation to my arrangement with the Southern Pacific Company. Such at least, Brother Reynolds letter of the 12th seems to indicate. I was aware before I came here that some trouble had existed between the Company and the Brethren at Salt Lake City about the transportation of our Elders over their Road. When I was introduced by President Shurtliff to Mr J. C.  Stubbs he refered to that difficulty and invited me to an interview for the purpose of talking it over; and if possable bring about a better understanding on the subject. When I went to that intervi I asked no favors; I promised nothing. I went with the determinat- ion to secure the best conditions possable for all our Elders mov- ing from place to place throughout the State or traveling to and from Ogden. I stated that all we asked for  same priv her donominations—the Clergymans half-fare-permit. But in relation to my self, having been appointed President of this Mission it was necessary that I should travel all over the State, and to facilitat^e^ my movements and enable me tovisitevery town and city through^ou^t the State and thus open up new fields to preach the Gospel and by so doing be enabled to place many more of our Elders in the Missionary service, a free annual pass would be of great benifit to the work in which I was engaged, and would result in greatly increased tra- vel of our Elders over their Road. That all these Elders had to come from Utah ^,I said^ "they can come over your r can go the other way, I have got a man to send home to morrow mor- ning, I can send him the other way" Mr Stubbs and Mr Donalson wh^o^ was with him then refered to the unpleasantness that occured some time ago, evidently with some feeling, and appearantly with deep regret; stating that such occurances must be avoided in the fut- ure: that they would issue the half-fare-permits to such as were  entitled to them who applied directly through me; this they requir- ed for their protection and to this I agreed. I had suggested that if they treated me and my fellow laborers with consideration and courtesy it would have the effect of removing the unpleasantnesses of the past and would doubtless secure the good will of the Pre- sidency at S. L. C. Mr Stubbs then said he would recomend to his  committee that the pass be issued for six months. It was expressly understood, that all Elders, wheather they were returning home from this, or from any of the Iland Missions, desiring to obtain the half-fare-permit, must apply for it through me; this was the only condition made.

You will understand from this that  I dident leave when I first expected to, but was, for  several reasons, delayed. The principle reason  of my delay was the fact the tracts I had ordered in Vienna did not turn out as I had expected they would. Shortly after my writing my last letter, I was informed, through Mr Baichel, the agent  through whom I had ordered, that the tracts  had been confiscated before leaveing the Vienna  house. "The manuscript" said B "Has been saved and sent to Leipzig whare the tracts will be re- printed without any extra cost to you." A  day or so after bringing this intellegence, Mr. B.  called again this time to say he had been sus- pected as being the one who sent the orders to  the Vienna house and, as a consiquence had  been summoned to appear before an investi gating board of Turkish Officials, whare, to shield  himself and me, he denied all knowledge of  the same, whare upon, th board telegraphed to  ENDENTRY  close who sent in the order. The firm were  placed under arrest and bonds were fixed  at 12 pounds. They were given two days to answer  in. The Vienna people wired B to learn if he would forfeit the 12 pounds or have his name revealed. "And now" Said B "I have come to find out if your  will pay the forfeiture." As I was tired of paying  out money on those tracts I told him no I certainly  would not pay a nother cent on them. He said  "Mr Musser if you dont pay that fine I will send  in your name as being the one who gave  me the manuscript" "I will get off all right" said he "but you will have four or five years to  stay in Turkey" I told him I had no objections  to his dooing just as he felt was right all that  I would insist upon was his furnishing  me the tracts I had paid for, and on his return- ing to me 6 pounds I had loned him while he  was in distress and for I held his note. At  this he became very boisterous and left threatening  to telegraph my name right off to Vienna I hardely knew what to do.

Prest Young ad- vised me to go Haifa but at this time Haifa  was quarantined on account of cholera hence  I had to remain in Constantinople four or five weeks  longer. In the meantime Bro Haag arrived from Herman had taken his depart- ure for Aintab some time before this. I had tried  several times to see Mr Baichel but was unsuccess ful untill one day I ran across him on the  street. He surprised me by saying he had  fixed everything "OK" in regards the tracts and  that they would be here in the course of a week  or ten days. Two weeks after this I was informed  by the steam ship company that the quarantine  at Haifa had been raised I had not yet received  the tracts and could get no trace of Baichel so I decided I had been defrauded and rather then waste any more time I would take Bro Haag  and go into Palestine.

I realize I have no au- thority to pay the expenses  of traveling elders in this mission. But as  ENDENTRY  tracts or Mr Baichel.   the cheapest way I would possibly get to Haifa  was via Port Said. I purchased  tickets to Alexandria. Upon our arrival here we were  told we would have to wait five days before we could  get a ship for Palestine. We therefore decided to go by  way of Cairo and see the Pyramids thence direct  up the celebrated Sues Canal to Port Said. Arriving  at Port Said in we had three more days to wait dooring  which time I was very sick. On Saturday the ship  arrived at Port Said and just at the last minute the agent at this place received a telegram say- ing the quarantine had not yet been raised at  Haifa and cansiquently not to sell tickets for  this station. So the nearest we could get to our  destination was Jappa, two days journey with  horses. I fear my letter is getting rather long so I  will close. I will add however that our ride from  Jappa to Haifa cost us 100. is not good I have written particulars to Prest Young and I think Bro Haag will be removed from this to  the German mission. In which case we would  need another German speaking Elder here. I am  very pleased with the outlook here in this part of  ENDENTRY  D. C. W. Musser  end of sideways text     Salt Lake City Utah U. S. A.     to hear something from the "Turkish Mission."  I  am sorry to have kept you waiting so long, but  the fact of the matter is, I have had nothing of  importance to communicate, and, therefore, thought  it best not to write.  Shortly after my companion's  death I had the pleasure of baptiseing two souls, sisters, at Jaffa whare I  baptised a nother sister, a blind lady.  These are  all germen people.  I havent, as yet, adminis- tered baptisn to any of the native Aribs, though  I have had one or two applicants.  After Bro Haag's  dismiss I thought I had better stay in this  part of the country as our saints here have been  left a long time with out an elder.  Preveious  to this I had been studying the turkish language. But as that is not spoken here, Arabic being the  tongue, I droped the former and took up the  latter study, which I find extremely difficult. Unlike other languages, one must first learn the grammer before he can read correctly.  My  desire was, and still is, to master this language that I might become proficient to teach others it. With this in view I employed a teacher, but  after a short time, on account of my finances,  I was forced to dispense with him.  Since  then my progress has been slow.

Having been born in the stable, and cradled in the manger the days and years of His childhood and youth were spent with His par- ents in the ordinary walks and avocations of life. Though there were some wonderful things occured in relation to His immaculate conception and birth: Angelic choirs from the upper deep descended chanting glad tidings of great joy, peace on earth, good will to man; Herod's cunning plans were baffled; his boundless rage, his cruel edict, the death of the innocents; Egypt with the young Child; his journey and return, his stay in Gallilee that the Scriptures might be fulfilled "He shall be called a Nazerene" ##Matthew 2:23## — all these dropped out of the public mind, and as the years rolled by were forgotten and lost except by His relatives and friends. As He sojourned among men during the years of His youth and early manhood there was nothing in His life to attract the attention of His fellows until He unostentatious- ly walked down into the waters of the river Jordan and there was bap- tized by John, and though the Holy Ghost descending from the upper deep was seen, as Jesus walked out of the water, to rest upon Him in the form of a dove, and a voice from heaven was heard to say "This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased" yet men did not in Him recognize the Son of God. ##Matthew 3:17## Though He preached the Gospel of Repentance and Baptism for the remission of sins, chose and ordained twelve Apostles and sent them forth to preach, and went forth healing all manner of sickness and dire disease Himself—causing. the blind to see, the deaf to hear, the lame to walk and leap for joy, teaching as no other man had taught, healing as  no other man had healed, rebuking as no other had ever dared rebuke men for the sins they daily committed, they rejected Him and condemned Him to a cruel death, and though He rose again (which fact was noised abroad so that all the inhabitants of Jerusalem were cognizant of it) yet they could not see in Him the Savior of the world.   vout men of all the surrounding nations, "suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as of a rushing, mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting, and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them (the Apostles) and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance" and the people of the multitude were all amazed for they  own tongue. ##Acts 2:2-4## Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice and said unto them, "Ye men of Judea, and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and hearken to my words." Then, repeating the words of the Prophet Joel, he showed to them that Christ should come,  and briefly sketching the history of His life, recounting His wonderful works and noble deeds, showing forth the fact to the people that they had by cruel hands put Him to death, thus crucifying the Lord of glory;  that in fulfillment of the Prophet's words, God had raised Him from the dead; that on the third day He had been seen by the Apostles and many others with whom He had conversed, "whereof we all are witnesses" ##Acts 2:32## There- fore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the ENDENTRY  Kanarra, Iron county, Utah.

Therefore let all the House of Israel know assuredly that God hath made that same Jesus whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ". Now when they heard this they were pricked in their hearts and said unto Peter and to the rest of the Apostles "Men and Brethren what shall we do?" Not until this moment did they believe in Christ as the Savior of the world. Though all His wonderful works had been per- formed in their midst, yet not until the story of His life, His terrible death, His glorious resurrection, and the wonderful out-pouring of the Holy Ghost now so magnificently manifested before their eyes, did faith spring forth in their hearts, and a desire to be partakers of the heavenly gift caused them to plead with the Apostles, "Oh what shall we do!" ##Acts 2:14-37## This faith is the main-spring of all action, a mighty moving power. By it Moses performed their wonderful works; the chil- dren of Israel passed through the Jerico fell, the Harlot David and others of the prop- hets subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises and stopped the mouths of lions. The Apostle Paul understood the wonderful power of faith when he said, ##Hebrews 11:6|Heb. XI, 6th,## "But without faith it is im- possible to please Him; for he that cometh to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those that diligently seek Him." This verse is self explanatory. If we did not know that God lives and will re The ##Hebrews 11:3|3rd verse## reads:"Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God." So then, not only could the wonderful works before recounted be performed by the old worthies, but even worlds could be framed when necessary through the faith that was in God who created them. But will faith alone accomplish the salvation of the souls of man? As opinions differ, and he who risks his soul's salvation upon the uncertainties of men's opinions has but a vain hope of being led aright, let the Scriptures answer the question. ##James 2:14-26|James 2nd ch. 14-26.## This de- claration of the great Apostle seems to set at rest for all time the theory that faith alone is sufficient to save mankind. In closing his speech, he very forcibly states that "As the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also." Shall we not say then, that works are necessary, and if so what are those works? Again let the Scriptures tell the tale. ##Matthew 3:2|Math. 3, 2nd## "In those days came John the Baptist—saying, Repent ye, for the kingdom of Heaven is at hand." Jesus came preaching the Gospel of the Kingdom of God, (##Mark 1:15|Mark 1, 15th.##) "And saying, the time is fulfilled, and the Kingdom of God is at hand; repent ye, and believe the Gospel." ##Mark 6:12|Mark 6, 12th,## "And they (the Apostles) went out, and preached that men whould repent." Jesus was evidently determined that there should be no mistake upon this matter when He said, (##Luke 13:3-5|Luke 13, 3-5##) "I tell you nay; but except ye repent, ye shall all like- wise perish. Or those eighteen upon  slew them, think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwell at Jerusalem? I tell you NAY; but except ye repent, ye shall all like- wise perish." The word of the Lord to Israel in the days of Ezekiel was equally positive. (##Ezekiel 18:30|Ezek. 18, 30th##) "Therefore I will judge you, Oh House of Israel, everyone according to his ways, saith the Lord God. Repent ENDENTRY  for the months of Jan &amp; Feb 1898.                         ENDENTRY  be your ruin." ##Ezekiel 18:30## Nor does it appear that conditions had at all changed in the days of the Apostle Paul for we find him declaring in the most emphatic terms (##Acts 17:30|Acts 17, 30th##) "And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men everywhere to repent." This then, is the first grand step of preparatory work in securing salvation in the Kingdom of God. But the question may arise, 'Wherein have I sinned? In what have I done wrong? I have complied with all the requirements of the decalogue, I have lived the golden rule, doing to others as I would be done by; what have I to repent of?' Look abroad upon the face of the earth, search i as organized and recognized by Him, and where do you find it? Like the ship-wrecked mariner whose weary eyes scan the vast horizon with a ling- ering hope that friendly sa grows faint and dies within him, so it is with many an honest-hearted one, seeking the way to eternal life, anon as he listens to the various creeds and examines the doctrines of the different sects, he discovers discrepencies everywhere. No one has a perfect form of worship, all have dwindled in unbelief; they have departed from the faith of the ancients; they have turned away from the true and living God, as the  Apostle Paul said (##2 Timothy 4:3|2nd Tim. 4, 3rd##) "For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine, but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers having itching ears, and they shall turn away their hearts from the truth, and shall be turned into fa ing a form of godliness but denying the power thereof. Preaching for doctrine the precepts of men   every town and city, village and hamlet over all the land, in which men preach for hire and divine for money, thus making merchandise of the souls of men, having, as Isaiah says "Transgressed the laws, changed the ordinances and broken the everlasting covenant" and "it shall be as with the people, so with the priest" ##Isaiah 24:5## ##Isaiah 24:2## and as Jesus said in Luke "Can the blind lead the blind? Shall they not both fall into the ditch?" ##Luke 6:39## We answer by saying as the Apostles of old said: "REPENT AND BE BAPTISED AND WASH AWAY YOUR SINS." Yes, for the fruits of repentance is a broken heart and a contrite spirit; and it is provided that such a one should  walk in the footsteps of Jesus, down into the water, and like Him, be buried beneath the liquid wave. This was the first act that Jesus did preparatoryto His ministerial labors, and the very last command He gave to His Apostles prior to His ascension up into heaven, (##Matthew 28:19-20|Mat. 28, 19-20##) "Go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptising them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost; teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you." And what had He just commanded them?— stronger (##Mark 16:15-16|Mark 16, 15-16##) "And He said unto them, Go ye into all the world and preach the Gospel to every creature, He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved, but he that believeth not shall be damned." Oh what an opportunity to secure eternal life, what a glorious promise,  and this too from the author of our salvation! We say that we believe on Him, that we have faith in Him, and yet we persistently refuse to ac- cept the conditions that He has offered for our salvation. Surely no ENDENTRY  Mar. 7 1898 end of sideways text ENDENTRY  His blood that we may obtain eternal life, has not the right to estab- lish the conditions upon which we may secure the benefits of that aton- ing blood. His promise is plain, and in language unmistakable, "He that believes and is baptized shall be saved" and let us not forget that the declaration is equally positive that "He that believeth not shall be damned." ##Mark 16:16## Nor is John the Beloved less  what the Savior said to John 3, 5th##) "Jesus answered, verily verily I say unto thee, except a man be born of water and of the spirit  he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God." Here is a declaration from the great Master Himself that ought to be sufficient answer to all who fondly imagine that they can find some other way. Again, there are those who believe that if they live a life of honor and integrity among men, and serve God according to the best light they have, that they will be entitled to an inheritance in the Kingdom of God. To all such let the Scriptures once more declare the fact. (##Acts 10:1-6|Acts 10, 1-6 was a man in Cornelius, a Centurion of the band called the Italion Band, a devout man and one that feared God with all his house, which gave much alms to the people and prayed to God alway. He saw in a vision, evidently about the ninth hour of the day, an Angel of God coming in to him and saying unto him,—Cornelius; and when he looked on him he was afraid and said,—What is it, Lord? and He said unto him Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God; and now send men to Joppa and call for one Peter. He lodgeth with one Simon, a tanner, whose house is by the sea-side. He shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do." Ah! Cornelius, thou God- fearing, alms-giving, prayerful man, there is something that you have not done! Though your faith has reached unto heaven, and your prayers have been heard and your alms-giving considered by the Almighty, yet there is something that you have not done of such great importance that the windows of heaven were opened and an angel sent forth unto you as a  messenger, to notify you of the fact. What is it, Cornelius? He sent for Peter as he was commanded, and when Peter came, saw their faith and heard their words and they believed on the Lord Jesus, "He command- ed them to be baptized." ##Acts 10:48## This is the door into the Kingdom of God.   object for which Baptism was institut be performed in the presence of a great number of people as a testimony to them that the humble penitent has put on Christ; others again, claim- ing that it is an "outward sign of an inward grace", and still others, that it was intended as a witness before men of a "change of heart". Not a word can be found in the Scriptures to support any of these positions,  but on the other hand, evidence abounds in the sacred Record to prove that the ordinance of baptism was for the purpose of "washing away" and "for the remission of sins". Let us take the testimony of ##Mark 1:4|Saint Mark 1,4;## "John did  for the remission of sins;" of ##Luke 3:3|St. Luke 3, 3,## "And he came into all the country about Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance for the re- mission of sins;" ##Acts 2:38|Acts 2, 38,## "Then Peter said unto them, Repent and be baptised, every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the re- ENDENTRY  Zion's SAVINGS BANK AND TRUST COMPANY.           informal meeting of the Shareholders of "Zions Savings Bank and Trust Co" at the Young  at 10 o'clock A.M. Tuesday next October 2 your presence is particularly  desirable     ENDENTRY  and be baptized and wash away thy sins." Here the grand question arises what does sin consist of? Is it not the violation of law or the break- ing of a command, and is not the sin of ommission as great as the sin of commission? Surely the commandment "Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy" is just as binding as the one that precedes it "Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord they God in vain"; yet the failure to obey the one would be the sin of ommission, while to break the other would be the sin of commission. ##Exodus 20:7-8## And are not the commandments issued by the Savior and His Apostles as much the commands of God as those uttered forth from the c when "God commands all men everywhere to repent" as in ##Acts 22:16|Acts 22, 16,## or where Peter commanded them to "repent and be baptized for the remission of sins" as in ##Acts 2:38|Acts 2, 38,## brings us under the condemnation of a broken law and adjudges us all as sinners before God.   leads to eternal life, which is baptism, and the object of that baptism that it is for the purpose of remitting or washing away our sins, it now becomes particularly interesting to decide who are proper candidates for baptism. Among the various sects and creeds of modern christendom many believe in the practise of baptizing little children. We unhesi- tat or justification of such a practice can be found in the Scriptures. It has been shown beyong question according to the Scriptures, that baptism is for the remission of sins. Sin is the breaking of laws or commands of God. The child, until it comes to the years of understand- ing, is not able to comprehend law or understand the binding nature of a command—to obey or disobey; hence it is irresponsible. For where there is no comprehension there is no law; and where there is no law there can be no sin; and where there is no sin, baptism is uncalled for and out of place and is the direct violation of the commands of our Sav- ior. For if by baptism one child who dies in its infancy may be ushered into the arms of Jesus, and for the lack of baptism another child dying in its infancy is forbidden His sacred presence, then are we not b ing His direct command where He said, as in ##Mark 10:13-15|St. Mark 10, 13-15## "And they brought young children to Him that He sho les rebuked them. But when Jesus saw it He was much displeased, and said unto them 'Suffer little children to come unto  not, for of such is the Kingdom of God. Verily I say unto you, whoso- ever shall not receive the Kingdom of God as a little child, he shall  not enter therein. And He took them up in His arms, put His hands upon  them and blessed them." The testimony of St. Luke is almost identical. It reads as follows (##Luke 18:15-17|Luke 18, 15-17##) "And they brought unto Him also, infants that He should touch them, but when His disciples saw it they rebuked them. But Jesus called them unto Him, and said, Suffer little children to come unto Me, and forbid them not for of such is the King- dom of God. Verily I say u dom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein." Clearly then, baptism was never intended for little children, for baptism hav- ing been instituted for the purpose of washing away sins, sins already committed, and the child not having committed any, the ordinance would ENDENTRY  and declares it necessary for the little child to be baptized, and bap- tizes it, is committing a most grievous sin in the sight of God. For if it were true, as claimed by many Christians, that the little infant that dies without baptism is shut out from the presence of God, that hell is paved with little unbaptized children, they are erecting a barrier to those little infants in the form of the ordinance of baptism and "for- bidding" all such to come unto Christ, thus breaking one of His most em- phatic commands uttered when "He was much displeased" at what they were doing and said, "Forbid them not, but suffer them to come unto Me." ##Mark 10:14## The little child is pure and innocent because it can commit no sin till it comes to the years of accountability. Sin then conceives in its heart,  and as it grows in years Satan tempts it and it becomes sinful and wick- ed, and the means provided by the Almighty to cleanse it and make it again as pure and as innocent as it was in the beginning of its mortal career, is the sacred ordinance of baptism. And thus may the repentant sinner become like the example that Jesus set before them as shown by ##Matthew 18:2-4|Mat. 18, 2-4##; "And Jesus called a little child unto Him and set him in the midst of them and said, Verily I say unto you, except you be con- verted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the king- dom of heaven. Whosoever, therefore, shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven." Thus the little child is given to us as a pattern of purity, a sample of innocence, by the Savior Himself; and the bare theory of baptizing such little inno- cents to wash away their sins, becomes revolting to the human mind when considered under the light of reason, as the practice of it is an abom- ination in the sight of God. So little children are not elegible to baptism. This declaration stands out in bold relief when viewed in the light of the following passages which plainly prove that all candidates for the kingdom of God must be capable of being taught. (##Matthew 28:19-20|Nat. 28, 19-20##) "Go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost, teaching them to ob- serve all things whatsoever I have commanded you." All must have suf- ficient mental development to be capable of  taught, as shown by the Savior's commandments, and ##Mark 16:16|Mark 16, 16##, "He that  shall be damned." "But when they believed Phillip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ they were baptized, both men and women." (##Acts 8:12|Acts 8, 12##) "And as they went on their way they came unto a certain water, and the Eunuch said, See here is water; what does hinder me to be baptized? and Phillip said, If thou truly believest with all thine heart though mayest, and he answered and said, I    impressed upon the heart, causes faith to spring forth in the soul, and we reflect with admiration upon the life of Him whose wondrous love was manifested towards us when He offered His life as a sacrifice for our sins. And by comparison we realize our own unworthiness, that our feet have strayed from the path of right and that we are steeped in iniquity. With this conviction comes a resolution to turn, if possible, from our ENDENTRY  saking of sin, a reverence for Almighty God and an earnest desire to search after and serve Him in spirit and in truth. We resolve to tread the path our Savior walked, down into the waters of baptism, thus follow ing Him down through the door into the Kingdom of God, that where He is we may be also. Sufficient mental capacity to be taught, to believe, to repent and to voluntarily offer ones self for obedience to the suc- ceeding principle of the Gospel are prerequisites to the ordinance of baptism. Little children cannot do these things, consequently there is no law of God requiring them to be baptised; and all man-made systems to the contrary will be null and void in the day of judgment.     orthodox Christian churches having departed from the faith of the Apostles, and built up churches to themselves for the purpose of making merchandise of the souls of men, have instituted the practice of sprin- kling and pouring &amp;c. and call it baptism, to support which not one word can be found in holy Writ. The whole sense of the ordinance of baptism from the time that John the Baptist came preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins, on through all the writings of the New Testament conclusively proves the fact that baptism by immers- ion was the mode taught and practiced by Jesus and His Apostles. ##Matthew 3:1-2## Jesus,  when He was baptized, "Went up straightway out of the water." ##Matthew 3:16## When Phillip baptized the Eunuch "They went down both into the water, both Phillip and the Eunuch, and he baptized him, and when they were come up out of the water, &amp;c" ##Acts 8:38-39## All this clearly indicates immersion, or why   "Therefore we are buried with Him by baptism into death" ##Romans 6:5|5th##, "For if we have been planted together in the likeness of His death." Certainly there is nothing in a sprinkling or a pouring that represents either a  burial or a planting, but each of these passages point in Unmistakable terms to a baptism by immersion. The Apostle Paul again makes this clear in his Epis wherein also ye are risen with Him." When John baptized in the wilder- ness "There went out unto him all the land of Jeru- salem, and were all baptized of him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins." (##Mark 1:5|Mark 1, 5##)   takably to the fact that immersion was the only mode of baptism practic- ed by the Apostles and early Christians. Profane history gives con- clusive evidence of this fact. Speaking of baptism in the first cen- tury Dr. Mosheim says "In this century baptism was administered in con- venient places without the public assemblies, and by immersing the can- didate wholly in water." (Mosheim's Church History (Murdock) Third Edition, Vol. 1, p. 87) Of the second century, the same great author says: "Twice a year, namely at Easter and Whitsuntine, baptism was administered by the Bishop or by the presbyters acting by his command and authority. The candidates for it were immersed wholly in water with the invocation of the sacred Trinity, according to the Savior's precept."   a case recorded by Eusebius, as happening in the third century. He alludes ENDENTRY  ous distemper, and it bei received baptism (being sprinkled with water) on the bed where he lay, (if that can be termed baptism) neither when he had escaped that sick- ness, did he afterwards receive the other things which the canon of the Church enjoined should be received." (Ecclesiastical History, (Eusebius) p. 113) Even down to the close of the thirteenth century baptism by immersion was the rule, and sprinkling and pouring the exception. Yet the innovation thus made in the third century has worked its insiduous way in the various divisions of Christianity until to-day a convert can have any kind of baptism he may desire; thus have they departed from the faith of the Apostles and are teaching for religion the commandments of men, having "Transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant," in fulfillment of the words of the Prophet Isaiah. (Isaiah 24, 5)     Christ is to secure the birth of the Spirit, or the baptism of the Holy Ghost; this being essential to enable us to pursue an acceptable course in the service of the Lord, that the Holy Ghost may be with us as an abiding gift, as a  life. The Lord in His wonderful plan for the salvation of the souls of men has provided a way for the humble and penitent baptized believer to secure this blessed gift. (Mark 1, 8) "I indeed have baptized you with water, but He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost." (Acts 1, 5) "For John truly baptized with water, but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence." Behold the promise fulfilled. (Acts 2, 2-4) "And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting, and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them. And the other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance." But this precious gift was not to be given until after Jesus was glorified, as shown by the following, (John 7, 39) "—for the Holy Ghost was not yet given, be- cause that Jesus was not yet glorified."   ious manifestation of heavenly light appeared sitting upon each of the Apostles who had accompanied the Savior in all His travels and had wit- nessed His wonderful works, and by His divine favor had been made par- takers of His holy ministry. They now received the promised blessing in rich abundance, and a way was provided by which they might transmit it to others who would comply with the special requirements, as shown by the following: (Acts 8, 17) "Then laid they their hands on them and they received the Holy Ghost." Evidently the Holy Ghost came not as the result of the baptism nor in answer to ^the^ prayer of the Apostles, but by the laying on of their hands. Clearly showing that this was the mode the Lord had provided by which the Holy Ghost should be conferred upon bap- tized believers; this again is clearly set forth in Acts 19, 5-6 "When ENDENTRY  when Paul had laid his hands on them the Holy Ghost came on them, and they spake with tongues and prophesied.     leads to eternal life, the straight and narrow way, and carefull noted the inscriptions along the line, down into the water through the door into the kingdom of God. Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, repentance of all sins, baptism by immersion for the remission of sins, gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands; this is the course marked out by the Father to prepare His children to receive the benefits of the aton- ing blood of Jesus Christ. Earthly things are typical of heavenly things as set forth in the following (1 John 5, 7-8) "For there are three that bear record in Heaven, the Father, the Word and the Holy Ghost, and these three are one; and there are three that bear witness in the earth, the Spirit, the water and the blood, and these three agree in one." By the water we keep the commandment, by the spirit are we justified and by the blood are we sanctified; and thus we become Saints. He who has fully repented of his sins and been baptized for the remiss- ion thereof, and received the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands, may then partake of the emblems of the Savior's flesh and blood; and in that sacred ordinance eat and drink to His soul the benefits of that atoning blood. And such have the promise of the Savior that they shall never hunger or thirst. There is no other way provided on earth by which mankind can secure the benefits of the aton     Every officer of our Government must be elected or appointed according to the mode established by the constitution of the United States, or  his official acts fall to the ground as null and void. The decisions of the court involving the validity of titles to land or other great inter- ests would be void if it could be shown that the judge rendering the decision had not been elected or appointed legally. Every deed issued by a Sheriff at a sher could be shown that the sheriff was a usurper and not legally authorized to officiate in the duties of the office. All naturalization papers issued by a judge when it could be shown that he had never been elected or appointed according to constitutional requirements, would by a legal tribunal be declared worthless and the holder deprived of his citizen- ship. In fact the question of authority to act in any of the affairs of human life is so clearly understood by all persons of ordinary intell- igence that time would seem to be wasted in discussing it; but not so in questions involving the future of the human soul. In these sacred and vastly more important matters upon which hang all our hopes of eternal life, the average man seems willing to trust to the opinions of a minister of some of the orthodox sects or to the wild vagaries of any upstart who cries "Lo here is Christ," or "Lo he is there" without for a single moment raising the question—Where is his authority to offic- ENDENTRY
