 HERSHEY IN BOSTON."Some one has said:"There is no city in America which so severely tests a public writer or speaker, in both style and thought, as Boston.IN THE MUSIC HALL COURSE.Whilst he was living in Washington City, and after having two lectures from him the Secretary wrote this:Boston, August 21, 1893.REV. SCOTT F. HERSHEY, PH. D. of Washington, has spoken twicein our Music Hall Course to an immense audience, and we have securedhim for another lecture Sept. 17th.Among all the able and eloquent speakers in the last six years who have appeared in this course, no one has struck a higher key, and we shall give him a tremendous ovation when he comes again.B. F. BRADBURY, Secretary Music Hall Course, Boston.How He Came to Boston.It was in 1893 that Dr. Hershey came on from Washington City to lecture in Boston. At this time the First Presbyterian Church was without a Pastor. A delegation from the Church heard him lecture twice, and asked him to consider a call. In the spring of 1894 he accepted a call to the Church, which stands in the lead of Presbyterian Churches in New England. The Church is attended by hundreds of young people and at night the preach-ing is attended by people from all over Boston and the towns about.In addition to his Church work, the Doctor is lecturing every Sunday afternoon, and from one to two nights a week.THE BOSTON NEWSPAPERSScott F. Hershey is a young, eloquent and convincing orator, whomall should hear.—Boston Globe.No speaker in the remarkable Music Call Course of six years, em-bracing many of the most eloquent men of the country, is better entitledto the terms "Orator," Scholar," and "Patriot," than is Dr. Hershey.—The Boston Herald.The lecture in the celebrated Music Hall Course was delivered by Scott F. Hershey, Ph. D., of Washington, D. C. More than two thou-sand were present, and the frequent, vociferous applause abundantly testified to the speaker's eloquence. At one time the great audience at Dr. Hershey's lecture went wild with enthusiasm, rising in a body to their feet, cheering, and even standing on the seats, as they gave vent to their feelings.—Boston Citizen.

 REMARKSBy Elder Wilford Woodruff, Tabernacle, Dec 61857.[REPORTED BY G. D. WATT. ]I esteem it a privilege at all times to join with my brethren in bearing testimony of thework of God. I am satisfied that we, as a peo-ple have great reason to rejoice for the privil-eges and blessings granted unto us in thesevalleys of the mountains by our Father in heav-en. We are in a great school, and it is a pro-fitable one, in which we are receiving very im-portant lessons from day to day. We aretaught to cultivate our minds, to control ourthoughts, to thoroughly bring our whole being into subjection to the Spirit and law of God, that we may learn to be one and act as the heart of one man, that we may carry out thepurposes of God upon the earth. Yes, we aretaught many principles which tend to our ex-altation and glory, which could not be made manifest unto us only as they are revealed untous by the inspiration of the Almighty throughthe mouth of his servants the Prophets.The principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ are made plain to us by the figures and illus-trations which have been made to-day and which are made from time to time, so plain,that a child could not misunderstand; also to impress upon our minds our duties. Those principles are not surrounded with that mys-tery that shrouds the doctrines taught by thesectarian world.We, as a people, have long been praying for the kingdom of God to come and His will to be done on the earth as it is done in heaven. We have been taught this prayer from childhood,but neither we nor our parents understoodwhat we were praying for, only we made a practice of uttering those words from tradition,and never understood the meaning until we were made acquainted with the Gospel of JesusChrist. Since we have become acquainted with br. Joseph and the gospel we have lookedforward with much interest to the day whenthe kingdom of God should be established up-on the earth in the same light, power and gloryin which the Apostles and Prophets saw it by vision and revelation, and that all which God has promised concerning it should have its ful-fillment.During the last twenty or twenty-five yearsmany things have been prophecied; and theLord through his servants has made many promises which have been revealed unto usconcerning the blessings that are in store forus if we faithfully do our duty. I can saywith my brethren that I rejoice that I amin these valleys of the mountains associated with the people of God a thousand miles from christianity, civilization and the fruits thereof,at least such as is now manifest throughout thechristian world, and I feel to prize this bles-sing and to acknowledge the hand of God inleading us here, for the hand of God has been plainly visible in delivering us from the hands of our persecutors and planting us in a landof health, peace and safety; and the more mymind is enlightened by the Holy Spirit the moreprecious and glorious do these principles ap-pear unto me.I am satisfied that all is right in Zion. All is right with those who lead us. All is rightas far as we do right. We have enjoyed manyblessings during the past year. The Lord has in his mercy poured out his Holy Spirit upon us as a people, and there is a great change withthe inhabitants of Zion during the past year. We were in a great measure asleep, and theLord knowing the things which lay before uspoured our is Holy Spirit abundantly upon our lead-ers who called upon us to wake up, and the Spirit of God was poured out upon the peopleand they have, in a great measure, endeavouredto repent, forsake their sins and unite them-selves together to carry out the counsels of hisservants. I have never seen the hearts of thispeople so united as during the past year. Noperson who has listened to the words of the Presidency of this church during a few monthspast and has seen the fulfilment of their say-ings, but can clearly see the hand of Godwith them and His Spirit guiding them contin-ually.The day that many of us have anticipatedsince we have been made acquainted with Jos-eph Smith and the gospel, has began to dawnupon us. The revelations of Jesus Christ are fastfulfilling before our eyes. We see the king-dom set up; and the time has come when the nation that has given many of us birth hasentered the field as our open enemies and per-secutors and commenced an unhallowed perse-cution against us, with a determination to des-troy us from off the earth. The same as cities, towns, counties and states have done beforethem, they have united together to crush anddestroy this people and remove them, if possi-ble, from the earth.Ever since I have been made acquainted with the Gospel and the progress of this peo-ple, I have always believed that the United States would take this course and in a nation-al capacity and under the form of law, seek to destroy the Church and kingdom of God from off the earth. For the light has come unto them and the gospel of salvation offered unto them and they have rejected it, and killed theprophets; hence the light and Spirit of God is taken from them, sin abounds, and they are filled with anger against all that is good. Theircourse is unconstitutional and contrary to everyprinciple of law, righteousness, justice, judg-ment and truth. In all our persecutions our persecutors have had no just cause for pursuing the course against us they have, only they were stirred up by the devil. Darkness, wickednessand abominations of every kind are increasing in the minds of the wicked nations of the earthbecause the Spirit of God is withdrawing from them. They have had the fulness of the ev-erlasting gospel offered unto them, but they have rejected it.There has never been a set of men since theLord made the world who have laboured morediligently then the Twelve Apostles and El-ders of this church in preaching the gospel tothe world. They have rejected the messagesent to them revealed by an angel from God, which leaves them now under condemnation.Br. Joseph would have embraced the wholecircle of the human family in the principles of salvation if he had possessed the power. He had the greatness of soul never seen in thehuman breast unless it was inspired by thepower of God. That same spirit has restedupon the present Presidency of this church,they have laboured incessantly for years to savethe children of men. And what have we re-ceived in return from the hands of the chris-tian world? They have driven us from our homes and fire sides and smitten and robbed us of the rights that are dear and most sacred to man, until we have at last been driven from the borders of civilization, so called, unto thewilderness by the nation that has given usbirth, whose boasted freedom exists only in name. Here they expected we should perish,but we still live, grow and flourish in thesemountains, through the mercy and goodness ofGod, without the aid or assistance of our per-secutors.Our nation was under no condemnation in this respect until the light came and they heard the gospel, rejected it, and cast out the Saintsfrom their midst, slaying their leaders and depriving thousands of the Latter Day Saintswho were American citizens of every blessing, right and privilege guaranteed unto them bythe Constitution and laws of the United States.Many of our nation have been guilty of crimesin their persecutions against us that would costthe lives of presidents, governors, senators, legislators, and many thousands of men if law and justice were executed in righteousnessagainst them. I do not know what more they can do to fill up the cup of their condemnation than to carry out the course they have begun. There is more crime, wickedness, and abomin-ation committed now throughout the United States, according to the population, in twenty-four hours—a thousand times—than there wasthirty years ago. I do not suppose there hasbeen a generation more wicked and corruptthan the present christian world.We have been told to-day that we are undergreat obligation to God, and that we ought toacknowledge his hand in all things. That is true. We had no knowledge of the plan of salvation until God revealed it unto us. We are dependent upon God and his servants forlight, and truth, and blessings that are in storefor us.We are told that the kingdoms of this worldwill become the kingdoms of our God and his Christ. Daniel of old says this, and pointed out the establishment of that kingdom in thelast days which should stand forever and notbe thrown down. He also pointed out the ef-fects which would follow. The Lord has al-ready revealed great and glorious truths andprinciples concerning the government of thechildren of men in the establishment of hischurch and kingdom upon the earth. Does it not require as much wisdom and revelation fromGod to govern the nations of the earth in away to bring men into subjection to righteous laws,light, privileges and blessings which theyare now deprived of in the organization oftemporal governments of the world, as is re-quired in the spiritual government of the church of Christ upon the earth. Where is that know-ledge to flow from? The spirit to do men goodand relieve the sufferings of mankind does not dwell in the breasts of monarchs, kings, presi-dents and rulers among the nations of the earth at the present day; but sorrow, crime, poverty,tyranny, oppression and starvation prevail throughout the world.The rulers of mankind have not sought forthe Spirit of God and the light of eternity toshow them the responsibility they are under toHim who has raised them to power and au-thority and given them dominion over theirfellow beings; they have not exercised theirpower and authority to honor God and redress the wrongs of the poor and oppressed over whom they preside.The misery and evils which now existthroughout the world have got to be correctedin a great measure, through the power of God, before the kingdoms of this world will become the kingdoms of God and his Christ. It is agreat and mighty work to establish the king-dom of God on the earth, that the law may goforth from Zion to rule the kingdoms of the world. The light, knowledge, truth and wis-dom to do this has got to come through theHoly Priesthood, which is the government of God upon the earth.Our temporal and eternal salvation is all con-nected and linked together as we have been told to-day. The Lord has raised up unto us fathers, leaders, and counselors after his own heart; they possess his will and they are lead-ing the people to exaltation and glory. If we take their counsel we shall receive all the sal-vation men can desire in time and in eternity. I thank God that I have lived to see the dawn of this glorious day.With regard to the dealings of the Lord withus this present season. President Brigham Young|Young has been as calm and serene as a summer's morn-ing, and so have his counsellors, and that spiritin a great measure has been diffused amongthe people. When there was every appear-ance outwardly of our enemies coming uponus, the spirit with them has been all the time"We do not believe we shall have to go to bat-tle or shed the blood of our enemies this sea-son." This has been the feeling when, to allhuman appearance it would seem that we wouldhave to shed the blood of our enemies or theyours. There is not such an example on history as the way in which our enemies have beenstayed from fulfilling their hellish designs. Itis the first time the American army has beenstayed in their course. They got as far as Ham's Fork and there they stuck. We have heardread their gracious proclamation. Many ofthe brethren wonder that they have not the wis-dom enough to make out a decent document,but I do not wonder at it, for this whole peo-ple have prayed that their natural wisdom might be taken from them. I should wonderif they had wisdom to make a sensibledocument or one that would pass an examina-tion.The Lord so far has fought our battles andhas proved his people. When men have beencalled upon to go out and lie in the path of theenemy, I have not known one instance of aman refusing to go. All have been willing togo and do as they were told. The Lord hasproved you in this and has accepted your offer-ing. The prayers of the Saints of God havebeen heard, and they will never fail of being heard and answered if we do our duty, for wehave a ruler who can do something for uswhen our cause is just. I feel as br. Taylor said to-day. It matters not to me what theLord designs of us, we should be passive in hishands.When different opinions were expressed as tothe course to be pursued this fall with our enem-ies, the Spirit has said to me at the time, be still and passive, and pray that wisdom may be givento President Young to dictate, and lead just right.There is where our prayers should center, we should continually call upon the Lord to inspire him with wisdom sufficient to lead forth the churchand kingdom of God unto exaltation, glory, andvictory.It is different with us than with the world, wehave a main channel thro' which to receive our light, knowledge and blessings, as was beautifullyillustrated by the President in the figure of the

 REMARKS.By Elder WILFORD WOOD-RUFF, at the Funeral Service ofElder William Pitt, in the Four-teenth Ward Assembly Rooms, SaltLake City, Sunday morning, Feb. 23, 1873.REPORTED BY D. W. EVANS.My friends here kindly granted me the privilege of making some open-ing remarks on this occasion. I had an appointment in Ogden to-day, but when I heard of the death ofBrother Pitt I felt as though Iwanted to attend his funeral. If I had heard that one of my ownfamily had dropped dead I should not have been more surprised thanI was when I heard of the death of Brother Pitt. I was conversing with him in the street, I think theday before he was hurt, and he was then, apparently, cheerful, comfort-able, well and happy. When I heard that he was dead, I imme-diately went to his house, visited his family and saw his body. I willsay that I seldom or ever give way to weeping, either for the living orthe dead, but upon this occasion, when I saw his body lie cold indeath, all the early scenes of my acquaintance with him in the Herefordshire mission rushed upon me like a whirlwind, and I confessthat I manifested a good deal ofweakness in giving way to weepingbefore the family. Solomon saysthere is a time to weep and a timeto laugh, a time to mourn and a time to rejoice; and there are timeswhen reason will excuse weeping. Anthony said, "I come to buryCaesar, not to praise him," yet An-thony did, on that occasion, por-tray before the Senate and citizensof Rome the virtues of Caesar in hispublic life. We have come to bury Brother Pitt, and I do not considerit wrong to speak of the virtues and good deeds of the dead any morethan of those of the living.My first acquaintance with Bro-ther Pitt was of such a character asto cause the formation of ties be-tween us of no ordinary nature, asit is, I may say, with all the asso-ciations of the elders of Israel. Theworld knows nothing about theseties. The ties they form togetherare very different from those form-ed between the servants of God,who are associated together in theholy priesthood and by the power of the Holy Ghost and the inspira-tion of the Lord our God. These areties that no men comprehend un-less they occupy the same positionthat we occupy. I have found thisin my whole career with this churchand kingdom. I love the brethrenand the Saints of God, because weare associated together in a great,noble and Godlike cause; and these associations are to ourselves, and what more can a man do than laydown his life for his friend? How many are there in this room and inthis church and kingdom, who, in case of necessity, would be willing to lay down their lives to savetheir brethren? There are thousands of them.I wish, and feel that it is my pri-vilege, to refer to my first acquain-taince with Brother Pitt, whosebody lies before us to-day. The history of the Herefordshire missionis before the world and before the Church, and I wish in a few words to refer to that mission, for it was there that I became acquaintedwith Brother Pitt. Brother Taylorand I were the first two of the Quo-rum of the Twelve who arrived inEngland in 1840. Brother Taylor went to Liverpool, and I went to the Staffordshire potteries. I labored there with Brother Alfred Cordon,who is now in the spirit world.We were preaching almost every night, and we baptized some near-ly every meeting. It was a very good mission.Some eighty miles from there, inHerefordshir, there were people who had never seen a Latter-daySaint, and never heard the gospel. Some six hundred of them had bro-ken off from the Wesleyan Metho-dists, and called themselves the "United Brethren." They wereunder the presidency of Elder Thos. Kington. They were searching for light and truth. As a body they had called upon the Lord, and had advanced just as far as they couldwith what light they had. They prayed to the Lord that he would open the way before them, thatthey might advance in the thingsof his Kingdom. While in thisposition I went one evening to fill an appointment in the Town Hall,at the town of Hanley. There wasa very large congregation, and I had appointments out for two or three weeks in that town and adjacent villages. As I went to take my seat the Spirit of the Lord came upon me and said to me, "This is the last meeting you willhold with this people for many days." I was surprised, because Idid not know, of course what theLord wanted me to do. I told theassembly when I rose, "This is the lastmeeting I shall hold with youfor many days." They asked me after meeting where I was going. I told them I did not know. I went before the Lord in my closetand asked him where he wished me to go, and all the answer I couldget was to go to the South. I gotinto a stage and rode eighty milessouth, as I was led by the Spirit ofthe Lord. The first man's house Iwent into was John Benbow's. He lives now down here at Cotton-wood. I had some conversationwith Brother Benbow and I told him that the Lord had sent me tothat place. But without wishingto dwell on this subject particularly I will say that I learned that they weresix hundred people there, underElder Kington, called United Brethren, and that they had been praying to the Lord for guidance in the way of life and salvation. Then I knew why the Lord had sent me to that place—he had sent, themwhat they had been praying for. I commenced preaching the gos-pel to them, and I also commenced baptizing, Elder Pitt being among the first who was baptized by me into this church and kingdom.The first thirty days after I arrivedthere I had baptized forty-fivepreachers, which flung nearly fiftypreaching places, licensed by law,into my hands; and out of the six hundred belonging to Elder King-ton's body all were baptized but onein seven months' labor. I broughteighteen hundred into the church in that mission, and I will say thatthe power of God rested upon me and upon the people. There was a spirit to convince and a people whose hearts were open and readyto receive the gospel. And asJesus said in reference to John,that all Judea and Jerusalem went out to John's baptism I felt as if all Herefordshire was coming to bebaptized. The third meeting thatI held at Brother Benbow's therector of the place sent a constable to take me up. I was just about to begin when he entered. I said tohim, "Take a chair until after meet-ind and I will attend to you." Hesat down and when I gotthrough he came forward and I baptized him with others. Hewent back and told the rector, "Ifyou want to take up that man youmust go yourself, I have heard himpreach the first gospel sermon I ever heard in the world." Almost every man that came to meeting was baptized.I did not see Elder Kington for some little time after going there; and when I did see him he came tome as the leader of the people. Ilaid before him the gospel. He said, "If it is true, I wish to em-brace it; if not, I shall oppose it." I said, "That is right." But I made a covenant with him. I saidto him, "If you will go before the Lord and ask him if this work is true, I promise you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that you shall receive a testimony for your-self if you will promise to obey it." He said he would, and he went away to attend to his appointments.The next time he came to Brother Benbow's, a few day's afterwards, I asked him if he had enquired of the Lord. He said he had. "What did the Lord tell you." "He toldme it was true;" and he then said he was ready to obey the gospel,and I baptized him. I name this because as soon as Brother Pitt heard this Gospel he obeyed it, andhe was one of the leading men inthe choir of the Church of Eng-land in Dimock. I now wish to re-late a circumstance concerning him. The first meeting I held inElder Kington's house Brother Pitt was present. I will say first,however, that Mary Pitt, brother Pitt's sister, was something likethe lame man who lay at the gate of the Temple called "Beautiful" at Jerusalem—she had not been ableto walk a step for fourteen years, and confined to her bed nearly halfthat time. She had no strength inher feet and ankles and could only move about a little with a crutchor holding on to a chair. She wished to be baptized. BrotherPitt and myself took her in our arms, and carried her into the wat-er and I baptized her. When shecame out of the water I confirmed her. She said she wanted to be healed, and she believed she hadfaith enough to be healed. I had had experience enough in this churchto know that it required a good deal of faith to heal a person who had not walked a step for fourteen years. I told her that according to her faith it should be unto her. It so happened that on the day after she was baptized Brother Richardsand President Brigham Youngcame down to see me. We met atBrother Kington's. Sister Mary Pitt was there also. I told Presi-dent Young what Sister Pitt wish-ed, and that she believed she had faith enough to be healed. Weprayed for her and laid hands uponher. Brother Young was mouth,and commanded her to be madewhole. She laid down her crutch and never used it after, and thenext day she walked three miles. This created a great deal of angerand madness in the feelings of therector of that town. We had bap-tized Brother Pitt, and this tookone from his choir of singers, andhe felt angry. We were holding a meeting at Elder Kington's houseone evening, when these things were taking place. The house had very heavy shutters on the win-dows of the first storey. We hadthese shutters closed, and I rose topreach. The rector came at the head of about fifty men armed with rocks about the size of a man's fist, orlarger than that. They surround-ed the house, and for about half an hour the house was battered withrocks like a hail storm, the whole of the windows of the second storey being stove in and the glass all bro-ken. I told Brother Pitt that Iwould go and see these men. He said, "No, I will go, you will be in-jured if you go." He went out into themidst of this mob, of about fifty, Ishould judge, I do not know the num-ber. He took their names, and the rector was the leader. They stoned Brother Pitt back to the house, but as we had finished meeting they left. We had to clear the house ofbroken glass and rocks before we could retire to bed. I name this be-cause it was one of Brother Pitt'sfirst labors with me, and I will say that from that time until the pres-ent he has been a true and faithful servant of God, and of this church.Associations of this kind have been formed by all the Elders of Israel who have gone abroad intothe vineyard to preach the gospel. We go forth and gather strangers to us in the flesh, but they embrace the same testimony and gospel with ourselves. This was the case withBrother Pitt. I do not mourn forhim, I did not when I was at hishouse; but all these scenes and earlyassociations rushed on my mind, and as I gazed upon him, andthought of the way he had beenstricken down, taken away from us, when to all human appearance hewas but an hour before, as it were, enjoying health and strength andattending to the duties of life, Irealized that in the midst of life we are in death.In his associations with thischurch and kingdom BrotherPitt was leader of the Nau-voo brass band for a long time; he has also been associatedwith the various bands here; and inhis associations with the peo-ple he made a great manyfriends, to whom he was en-deared because of his many virtues and good deeds, and his dispositionand desire to serve God. I am cer-tainly glad to see so many friendsgathered together to honor his re-mains. When I realize that a manlike him has lived, heard the gos-pel, embraced it and has fulfilled the measure of his day, what canwe say about him? Can we mourn because he is gone? Bless your soul,he is with Joseph to-day, and withothers of the elders of Israel, and herejoices with them. Whether his spirit is here witnessing his funeralservices I can not say, it is not re-vealed to me; but suffice it to saythat he is happy, and blessed are the dead that die in the Lord, from henceforth saith the spirit for they rest from their labors and their works do follow them.I do not know whether Brother Pitt has preached much in theworld, but I do know that he haslabored for the benefit of the Saintsof God. But he will preach now.He has gone to the other side of thevail, and he will preach there to large assemblies of spirits. He hasbeen faithful and he will receive a crown of life. His body will lie inthe tomb a few years, and but afew. His death is a loss to his wifeand children, and the parting is grievous. But how glorious is thethought that there is a victory over the grave! In Adam all died, butin Christ all are made alive. Christ was the first fruits of the resur-rection. This is a glorious thought to me when I see a Latter-day Saint lie down with the harness on, true and faithful until he has wound up his work.Out of that 1800 which we baptiz-ed in Herefordshire in seven months, I hardly know one that has turned against this church.There has been less apostacy out of that branch of the church and kingdom of God than out of the same number from any part ofthe world that I am acquainted with.We are called every day or two tobury some of them. A good manyof them are still living. Some of them are bishops—Bro. Clark, Bro. Rowberry, and a good many ofthem scattered all through thisTerritory. Old father Kington is still living or was the last I heardof him, though near the grave. They are passing away, and when I went to see Brother Pitt's body, the thought came to me, Whose turngo next? May be mine, may beyours, we can not tell anything about it. These things should be an admonition to us to be true andfaithful while we dwell here. Thethought that we can obey and besanctified by the gospel, and be prepared thereby to inherit eternal life, is one of the most gloriousprinciples ever revealed to man. Ithank God that I have been associatedwith such a class of men and wo-men as those who are gathered to-day in the valleys of the mountains. They are the people whom the Lord has chosen. We have a hopethat the world knows not of, andit can not enter into their thoughts.Unless they are born of the Spiritof God, they can not even see thekingdom of God, and they can notget into it unless they are born ofthe water and of the Spirit, hencethey can not share in the joyousanticipations and hopes that wepossess. Their eyes, ears and hearts are not opened to see and hear and feel the power of the gospel of Christ.Brother Pitt has gone before his family to prepare a place for them.I say to them, let your hearts re-joice before the Lord. You are left alone, he has gone before you, buthe will prepare the way. He is not going to lie in the spirit world with-out having something to do. Therethose who have gone before us have something to do as well as we have here. They are laboring to preparethe inhabitants of the spirit world for the coming of Christ, the sameas we are trying to prepare the in-habitants of the earth for thesame great event.I do not wish to occupy a greatdeal of time, but I will say to my brethren and sisters this morning, It is better to go to the house ofmourning than to the house offeasting. Death is the end of allmen. The living should lay thisto heart. My associations withBrother Pitt have been of the most joyful and consoling character. We associated together a good while in that land, while I dwelt there; and we have been since, both in Nau-voo and this place. I was alwaysglad to meet him. I met him of-ten in the streets, and we scarcely ever met without referring to for-mer times, and if I can only haveas good a glory, and lie down as hehas—die the death of the righteous—and have as good a reward, Ishall think myself very well off. Iconsider that when a man has em-braced the gospel, continued faith-ful, received his endowments andthe sealing blessings of God uponhis head, as Brother Pitt has, hehas accomplished the object for which he was created.In closing my remarks I will say that I am thankful for the associa-tions I have had with Brother Pitt,and with the rest of my brethrenand the Saints. This is the gospel ofChrist; this is the Zion and King-dom of God.  The hand of God is stretched out for the salvation of this people, and however dark theclouds may appear; however strong persecution, oppression and opposi-tion may become to this work, theLord has, from its commencement,until to-day watched over its inter-ests, and has sustained and pre-served it, and he will continue todo so until its consummation; untilZion arises and puts on her beauti-ful garments, and all the great events of the last days are accom-plished. Then, in the morning ofthe first resurrection, Brother Pitt will come forth, and he and his family will be reunited, and they and all the faithful will receive their exaltation. This is a glorious thought! We should prize our families, and the associations we have together, remembering that if we are faithful we shall inheritglory, immortality and eternal life,and this is the greatest of all thegifts of God to man.I pray that God will bless you,that he will comfort the hearts ofthe family of Brother Pitt, that he will feed and clothe them, and unite them together, and preserve them in the faith, that when theyget through with this world, they may meet their companion and beprepared with him to receive exal-tation and glory, which may Godgrant in the name of Jesus, our Re-deemer,  amen.

 gas pipe. You may take the smartest men thattalent and learning ever made and put them in thechurch of God, and they never can get ahead of their leader. Their wisdom would be turned intofolly. Why? Because they are not called to lead.If a man has never learned a letter of a book, if the Lord calls upon him to lead the church andkingdom of God, he will give him power to do it. We have had these lessons laid before us day afterday, calling upon us to be united, and our heartsto become as the heart of one man, that our pray-ers and works may be centered to one point in carrying out the counsel of our head.The Lord will lead President Young where he wants him to go. We know God is with him,and has led him all the time; and he led Joseph while he lived. The Quorum of the Twelve may exhaust their talent and acquirements in exhibitingprinciple upon any matter which belongs to thehead to reveal, and yet the Prophet has to pointout the error, and set us right. The whole church may unite to carry out any point that ought to come thro' the head, and we could not effect it. Itrequires br. Brigham to tell us what is right andwhat is wrong in many things, because that is his place and calling. There is a perfect channel ex-ists between the Lord and him, through which he obtains wisdom, which is diffused through other channels to the people. That we know. We have got to learn to bring this knowledge intopractice.Let this people go to work and sustain the head of this Church all the time, and let theirprayers continually ascend in his behalf, thatGod may give him wisdom for our guidance.Then no matter if armies approach us, or all hell boils over. Let the people be perfectly passivein the hands of God, live their religion and learn and profit by the daily lessons they receive. Thenyou will find that glory, victory, and prosperity will abide with this kingdom.I do not believe that any general since theLord made the world, has been the subject of more earnest prayers than Gen. Wells has since he has been out in the mountains. He has beenwell sustained, and so has President Young. Ihope we may increase in this until we arrive at perfection. Then you will see clock work, per-fect harmony, and the effects of it wherever itis manifest; whether it be in a Bishop overhis Ward, in the Twelve Apostles, in a President over a branch of the church, or in a father over hisfamily. You will obtain blessings by thus sus-taining every man in his place and calling, youcan not get by any other principle. But cross a Bishop, a Prophet, or a father over his family in their track, and you will see a friction immedi-ately, you will see trouble, difficulty, darknessand affliction, and nothing will go right. This isthe principle that will save this kingdom, and leadit forth to glory, victory and salvation.We have been driven and afflicted for twenty-five years, and gained an experience we now begin to profit by; that we might attain power to judgeproperly of contrasts, and of right and wrong.Had President Young and this people remained undisturbed in Kirtland from [18]34 till this time, wecould not have gained the same experience we now have; therefore, I believe that hand of God has been in all that we have passed through. The experience of the First Presidency of this churchhas been very great. No man that lives has pas-sed through the same school; therefore, theirgreat knowledge and wisdom, aided by the inspir-ation of the Almighty.I do not know what the intention of the Lord is as to us in the future, but victory is promised unto this people.The kingdom of God is in the valleys of themountains, and we enjoy its blessings. That should be sufficient for us. As to outward losses,they are of little consequence. The law of God is in the mouths of those who are set to lead us. If the Lord should give a revelation through themthat would appear contrary to our traditions, ourcustoms, or reveal new principle, things whichhave been hid from the foundation of the world,it should not try the faith of the Saints. The Lordhas given revelations according to the capacity ofthe children of men.If there was a point where man in his progres-sion could not proceed any further, the very idea would throw a gloom over every intelligent and reflecting mind. God himself is increasing and progressing in knowledge, power and dominion, and will, worlds without end. It is just so with us. We are in a probation, which is a school ofexperience. It is a blessing to breathe the elementthat is in this place; to behold the unity of thepeople in trying to bring their wills into subjection to the will of the Lord their God.I am glad we are here, and our enemies wherethey are. Those of us who have been here for some ten years can not realize the great contrastbetween Utah and the rest of the world; we hard-ly know how to prize our privileges. Were weplaced in any of the large cities of the United States and Europe, we should hardly believe we were in the same world. The sounds of blas-phemy are not heard in our streets, rioting, drunk-enness, whoredom, rape and murder, and the blackcatalogue of crime practised in the Christian worlddo not meet the eye or salute the ear of the pas-ser by in Utah. The contrast between the cityof Great Salt Lake and the cities of the nations abroad, touching the order, decency, virtue, andmoral character of the people here, can not betold.Having been made acquainted with the gospel, we have been trying to improve ourselves; wehave a good degree of faith in our leaders, andtried to follow the word of God from their mouths. We have improved in these things, and my pray-er is that we may continue so to do and prize the blessings, privileges, freedom, and spirit, andpower of the Holy Ghost that is poured upon usin these peaceful valleys. We need not any longerthirst for the things that are in the world. Weare the best off of any people. If there is any peace, safety, or salvation, it is here.The day is not far distant when nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and state against state, and there will be sorrow suchas never was among men. Watch the signs of thetimes, for we are living in an important age. Theprophecies relating to our time are rolling in upon us; are we prepared to meet them? It is impor-tant for men and angels to note the events of thisage. We live in the commencement of a new era of the dealings of God with the world. The earthhas been under the dominion of the devil almostfrom its creation. But in our day the Lord has set up his kingdom, never to be destroyed.The Lord has planted his church and kingdom upon the earth in other ages, but those that under-took to maintain it were soon destroyed throughthe power of wicked men and devils. Righteousmen were not permitted to live upon the earth,even the Son of God was not permitted to preach righteousness but a short time before he and his followers were crucified and slain, but the day hasnow come when He has begun to prepare the way that he may come and take possession of the earth himself, and reign King of nations, as Hedoes now King of Saints. The day of the devil'spower to prevail against the kingdom of God has passed away. The kingdom is within you, in thevalleys of these mountains. Brs. Joseph, and Hy-rum, and Willard, and Jedediah, and Parley, and a host of others who have gone behind the vail, areas much engaged in the establishment of this kingdom, and in our welfare as a people, as we are.We should prize and not abuse the blessings God has put within our power, and improve uponthe lessons we learn, and obey the teachings giv-en to us through the inspiration of the Holy Ghostto the servants of God set to lead us. We haveevery thing to encourage us. We are favored ofGod, and whom the Lord favors who can success-fully oppose. Would President Buchanan havesent an army here to lay a foundation for our de-struction if the eyes of his understanding had notbeen darkened? No, if he had been enlightened by the Holy Spirit and could have foreseen the re-ward he will meet, he would sooner have suffered his blood to have been spilled, and it would havebeen better for him. The nation does not knowwhat they are doing, nor comprehend the fearfulresults of the course they are pursuing. They areturning the last key to rend the nation asunder,and they will be broken as a potter's vessel and cast down as a nation to rise no more for ever.For whenever the rulers of any nation trampletheir own Constitution and Laws under foot, and oppress and destroy the weak, because they havethe power and the people love to have it so, they sow the seeds of their own dissolution, and they will reap their own destruction.We have nothing to fear. The Lord is with usand will sustain and nourish his church and king-dom, as he has done from the beginning. He sus-tained it when it was surrounded by the bowelsof hell in Warsaw and Nauvoo, in Jackson, Clayand Caldwell counties when it was small as amustard seed, and he can sustain it here when itis surrounded by the mountain of rocks.The heathen may rage and imagine a vain thing,but the Lord will hold them in derision and guide them as with a bit and a hook in their jaws, whilehis people shall flourish like a watered garden up-on the mountains. All the promises of God willbe fulfilled unto us: a little one shall become athousand, and a small one a strong nation, and the Lord will hasten it in its time. Amen.

 REMARKSBY ELDER WILFORD WOODRUFF.It is not my purpose at all to de-tain this congregation, but before dismissing I feel that I would like to say a few words. We are not in the habit of flattering any man, but I want to say a few words concerning Brother Pratt. If there is any man dead or alive who has dwelt longer in this church and kingdom than he has I do not know him. If there is any man that has travelled more miles in preaching the gospel of Christ, in bearing testimony of the kingdom of God on the earth, I do not know who he is. When Brother Pratt embraced this gospel he was a boy—in one sense of the word illiter-ate and unlearned, the same as Joseph Smith and the most of us. Whatever knowledge Brother Pratt has obtained, either of the learning of the world or of the kingdom of God, he has obtained it by diligence and labor since he em-braced this gospel. I have been as-sociated with Brother Pratt myself for 47 years. I have travelled with him by sea and by land, in foreign countries and at home, and I never saw a man in my life that I know of that has spent as few moments idly as he has. I have never seen a storm at sea so heavy—even when shipping seas over the bow, side and stern—but what he would read his book. Whenever the breakers be-came too heavy he would simply shut up the book until they were over. If there is a man on this con-tinent who is more at home in the starry heavens, in the astronomical world than Brother Pratt I do not know who he is. If there is a man more deep-ly versed in mathematics than Brother Pratt, I do not know who he is. There may be many men equal to him in these things, but if there are, I do not know them. How has he obtained his knowledge? He has obtained it since he embraced this work. He has improved his time. Brother Pratt is the only living man to-day that was in the first quorum of the Twelve in its first organization, and I am pleased to listen to his testimony of the gos-pel of Christ; for I want to say to Brother Pratt and to all other men,we all have to acknowledge this; Joseph Smith, Brigham Young, the Apostles, and all men in this Church and kingdom, if there is anything to us, if there is anything about us, if we have any knowledge, or any power, or any influence, we have to give God the honor of it. It is not of ourselves. Joseph Smith always acknowledged this, as have all men in this Church and King-dom. We have been called from the plow, from the plane, from the ham-mer—ignorant, illiterate boys, and thrust into the vineyard; and all the power we have, or ever had, in building up this Kingdom, we have to acknowledge it as coming from the hand of God. Brother Pratt was one of the earliest men who shoul-dered his knapsack and travelled through this American continent to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ to this nation. Frequently he would suffer from ague all day and go along and preach his sermon at night. These are experiences that he and others have passed through in the early rise of this Church, and I feel to thank God that we can still hear his voice and the voice of others who have been long in this Church and Kingdom. I hope the Lord will preserve his life until he is satisfied with it. He has lifted up his voice long and loud, ac-cording to the commandment of God to him, in bearing record of this gospel and kingdom to the nations of the earth. I was struck in my mind,in contemplating our own experi-ence, with some of the remarks he has made to-day with regard to the Apostle Philip—how our own expe-rience has agreed with that of the ancient apostle. How many times have we been called by revelation to go to the right or left, here, there and the other place, contrary to our expectation? I will here relate what took place in my own experience. I was in Staffordshire in the year 1840. I was in the town of Stanley and held a meeting in the City Hall. I had a week's appointments out in that town. Before I rose to speak to the people, the Spirit of the Lord said to me, "This is the last meeting you will hold with this people for many days." I told the congrega-tion when I rose what the Spirit of the Lord had manifested to me. They were as much surprised as I was. I did not know what the Lord wanted, but I saw the purpose of God afterwards. The Spirit of the Lord said to me, "Go south." I traveled eighty miles; went into the south of England. As soon as I arrived, I met John Benbow. It was clearly made manifest to me why I had been called thither. I had left a good field, where I was baptizing every night in the week. When I got to this place, I found a people—some 600 of them—who had broken off from the Wesleyan Methodists and formed themselves into a sect called the United Brethren. I found they were praying for light and truth,and that they had gone about as far as they could go. I saw that the Lord had sent me to them. I went to work amongst them and ultimately baptized their superintendent, forty preachers and some 600 members; I baptized every member of that denomination but one. Altogether some 1800 were bap-tized in that field of labor. I sup-pose some of those then baptized may be in this congregation to-day. I name these things to show how we have to be governed and control-led by the revelations of God day by day. Without this we can do no-thing. Many of our brethren who were with us at that time and who came to this valley, have passed be-hind the vail. Eight of the quorum of the Twelve who were in the flesh and most of them with the pioneers, to-day are in the spirit world. We are passing away.I know as Brother Pratt has said, that this is the kingdom of God. Is-rael is being gathered together. The revelations of God are being fulfilled, and nothing will be left unfulfilled. Therefore, as Saints of the living God, let us be faithful to our testimony. We have the king-dom of God. We are called of God by inspiration and commandment to warn this generation, to preach the gospel, to gather the people, to build up Zion, to build Temples, to redeem the living and the dead, and to carry out the great work which is laid upon our shoulders, and may God enable us to accomplish these things for Jesus' sake. Amen. 
 REMARKSBYPREST. WILFORD WOODRUFF, At Bountiful, June 26, 1881.----------------REPORTED BY GO. F. GIBBS. ------------------There are a few of us still living in the flesh and able to mingle withthe people, but our orbit or circuit has become so extended that we area little like the courts—it takes us a long time to get around to visit the people.J1175233You have had excellent counsel this morning from our brethren. They have taught us a portion of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, which weshould treasure up. We occupy adifferent position from any other generation; there has never been a generation since God made the world that has been called upon to perform the work that the Latter-day Saints have. Reference has been made to the city of Enoch. Enoch stayed as long as he could inthis world; and through his labors apeople were sanctified who, withhimself and their city were taken away from the earth because of their righte[o]usness. The people of God inno generation have been able to dwell upon the earth only so long as they were able to finish their mis-sion; the wicked living contempo-raneously with them have war-red against them and have conquered and overcome them in a great measure, until many havehad to seal their testimony with their blood. It is our lot to live inthe great and last dispensation thatGod has given unto man, the dis-pensation in which a people is to beprepared to build up the kingdom ofGod on the earth, which is to be thrown down or overcome no more for ever. God has called a class of men and women who, with the ex-ception of a few, have been per-mitted to live out their days and die a natural death. It is true thatJoseph Smith, who laid the founda-tion of this work, and others, havehad to s[e]al their testimony with their blood; and if I were to tell whatI think about it, I would say it wasordained of God that our Prophet and head should be sacrificed in themanner that he was, as much as it was ordained of God that JesusChrist should be sacrificed in the way that he was; and that for twopurposes—in order that his testi-mony might remain in force uponall the world from the hour of his death, to rise up and condemn thisgeneration who reject the Gospel of salvation. With the exception of afew, it has been designed, I believe, that the Prophets and Apostles of this dispensation should not have to seal their testimony with theirblood, but that they should live un-til they finish their missions on theearth, bearing their testimony to the truth of the work, and building upthe kingdom of God; and then they will gather up their feeb[feet] and sleepwith the fathers, surrounded by their children and friends. This people and these Elders who bearthe Melchisedek Priesthood, through the providence of Almighty God, will not be called upon to go forth, like David of old, and shed the bloodof their fellowman in their own de-fense. There were many things required of him which will not be required at our hands; and some things he was not permit-ted to do, because he was a man of blood. These are my views with re-gard to our position.J1175233 - 234We are called of God. We havebeen gathered from the distant na-tions, and our lives have been hid with Christ in God, but we have notknown it. The Lord has beenwatching over us from the hour ofour birth. We are of the seed of Ephraim, and of Abraham, and ofJoseph, who was sold into Egypt, and these are the instruments that God has kept in the spirit world tocome forth in these latter days to

 Woodruff ArizonaMar. 7, 1898President Wilford WoodruffSalt Lake CityDear Brother In givingmy feelings in Regards toCall which I received from You on 4 inst Will sayI am willing to preformany work which God seesfit to call me to perform and while I feel truly Honoredto be counted worthy ofsuch a Call I also feelmy my w[e]akness in undertakeng such a work as thatof a missionary to promulgate 
 take hold of this kingdom and build it up. These are my sentimentswith regard to the Latter-day Saints. I will repeat what I haveoften said—there is no p[o]wer beneath the heavens that can remove Zion out of her place, or destroy this Church and kingdom, as long as thepeople do the will of God, for Hewill sustain them, and overrule the acts of their enemies for their goodand for the final triumph of His truth in the earth. It is now over ffifty years since the organization of this Church and kingdom, and since itsbirth it has continued to progress and grow in numbers and in influ-ence and power, and it will do sountil Zion presents herself before the heavens in her glory, power and dominion, as the old prophets haveseen it in vision. Then, what man-ner of men and women ought we to be, who are called to take part in the great latter-day work? We shouldbe men and women of faith, valiant for the truth as it has been revealedand committed into our hand. Weshould be men and women of integrity to God, and to His holy Priesthood, true to Him and true to one another. We should not permit houses and lands, gold and silver, nor any of this world's goods to draw us asidefrom pursuing the great objectwhich God has sent us to perform. Our aim is high, our destinyis high, and we should neverdisappoint our Father, nor theheavenly hosts who are watch-ing over us. We should not disap-point the millions in the spirit world, who too are watching over us with an interest and anxiety that have hardly entered into our heartsto conceive of. These are greatand mighty things which God re-quires of us. We would not be wor-thy of salvation, we would not be worthy of eternal lives in the king-dom of our God, if anything could turn us away from the truth or fromthe love of it. The Lord told Jo-seph that he would prove him, whether he would abide in His cov-enant or not, even unto death. Hedid prove him; and although he hadthe whole world to contend against, and the treachery of false friends towithstand, although his whole lifewas a scene of trouble and anxiety and care, yet, in all his afflictions, his imprisonments, the mobbings and ill-treatment he passed through, he was ever true to his God, and true to his friends.J1175234I have had some reflections on the same subject referred to by Brother Cannon. In going into the houseof Brother Call, and those of themany of the brethren, what do we see? We see good houses, pleasant homes, and the inmates thereof, en-joying the necessaries and comforts of life. We have places to rest, we have places to lay our heads. How different are the circumstances that surround us to-day in comparison with our situation beforewe came to these valleys, and in comparison with the experi-ence of many of the ancients. Jesus himself, the son of the living God, had not where to lay His head. Thefoxes, he said, had holes, and the birds of the air had nests, but theSon of Man had not a place to lay His head. He traveled in the midstof poverty all the way to the cross. We have been in the same condi-tion. We who have been in this Church since its early days have known what it is to be withouthomes, to travel without purse orscrip, to go hungry and almost nak-ed, to suffer from cold and fatigue.When we came here the ground was all that we had to lie upon, and wewere glad and felt to rejoice in our hearts that God had brought us to aplace where we could lie down, if itwas upon the ground, in peace, free from the persecution of our enemies. God has proved us in days that arepast and gone. He has now given us a country and a home. It has been well said that we should beca[r]eful lest these conveniencies and comforts, by which we are now sur-rounded, should draw us from the things of God. Remember, my brethren, the greatest gift that God can bestow upon us is eternal life, and it is worth more than all the houses and lands or the gold and the silver upon the earth. For by and by we will go to the grave, and that puts [a]n end to worldly posses-sions, as far as our using them is con-cerned. The grave finds a home f[o]r all flesh, and no man can take his houses and lands, his gold and silver, or anything else of a worldlycharacter, with him. We broughtnone of th[e]se things with us whenwe came from our previous state. As Bishop Hunter says, babies are born without shoes and stockings. All the knowledgethat we can accumulate from experience and observation, andfrom the revelations of God to mangoes to show that the riches of this world are fleeting [a]nd transitory, while he that has eternal life abid-ing in him is rich indeed.J1175234 - 235 We have a great work before us in the redemption of our dead. Thecourse that we are pursuing is beingwatched with interest by all heaven. There are fifty thousand millions of people in the spirit world who arebeing preached to by Joseph Smithand the Apostles and Elders, his associates, who have passed away.Those persons may receive their testimony, but they cannot be bap-tized in the spirit worl[d], for some-body on the earth must perform this ordinance for them in the flesh, be-fore they can receive part in the firstresurrection, and be worthy of eter-nal life. It takes as much to save a dead man as a living one. The eyesof these millions of people are watch-ing over these Latter day Saints. Have we any time to spend in try-ing to get rich and in neglecting ourdead? I tell you no.J1175235 Here is a subject I have thought about. David said, "Let my ene-mies go to hell quickly.["] Hegot angry, and he did somethings he should not have done. OurSavior acted right the reverse. The more light and knowledge a man has, the more of the power of God he enjoys, and the more he is ableto comprehend the things of God. Why did the Savior say; when he was under the agonies of death, "Father, forgive them?" BecauseHe knew well [t]ha[t], although they were blind as to what they were do-ing, they and their posterity wouldwelter for 1,800 [y]ears under thecurse of God, for the deed they were perpetrating. He knew what the result of the shedding of his bloodwould be upon the human family, ye[t] He was sorrowful because Heknew that before he should come again as their Shiloh the Jewishnation would be trodden under foot of the Gentiles. The result of their treatment of the Savior of the worldstill afflicts them. In many coun-tries they are still persecuted and deprived of the right of citizenship,and are not permitted to purchaseland and hold it as personal proper-ty. The Savior could foresee their future, and what would befall them and their race, until Heshould come again. While He himself suffered, He could exclaim, knowing all the cir-cumstances, "Father, forgive them." Brother Tay[l]or feels the same to-wards this nation. We should all have the same feeling, and if we en-joy the Spirit of God, we can over-come that feeling which arises in thehearts of men to resent a wrong, to return evil for evil. Joseph went to God, and he opened his mind by vision, in which he saw the destruc-tion of our nation; he saw that fam-ine and pestilence and war would lay waste our land, until it became so terrible that he prayed God to close the vision. Well may we say,"Father, forgive them." Well may we pray for them, and feel in our hearts not to envy them, but leave them in the hands of God.J1175235 - 236 There are two spirits with us. Iwill relate a little circumstance which took place with me. I broughtPresident Young sick in my carriageon July 24th, 1847, the first time heset his eyes upon this valley. In pro-cess of time I followed President Young to the Utah penitentiaryunder the edict of a religious bigot and wicked man, [b]ecause he felt his dignity was not honored by [P]resident Young. On my way to the place of confinement I remem-ber what my reflections were. I thought to myself, "Now, here is President Young, the man, under God, who came here, far removedfrom civilization, the pioneer of emi-gration to the great West, and founda barren, desolate land, inhabitedonly by a very poor lot of Indiansand wild animals: to-day it blossomscomparatively as the rose; and to-dayhe is a prisoner on his way to jail." It worked upon my mind consider-ably. By and by another spirit said to me, "Be still, and know that Iam God, and will fight the battles of this people; you need no[t] allow yourself to be troubled about this."The result we all know. That very act leveled Chief Justice McKean to the ranks of the common citizen from which he never rose again, and he has since passed away, and like others, is in the hands of God.Brigham Young will rise in judg-ment against him and against allmen who have persecuted and ma-ligned and abused him. That willbe the ca[s]e with all of us—we shallbe called upon to judge this genera-tion. We should as Saints of God, never allow ourselves to wish thedestruction of those who oppose orpersecute us, but leave them in the hands of our God, to deal with themas he in his justice and mercy maysee fit.J1175236With regard to the law of God, it is all right. We can well afford to keep it and trust in Him. I look upon it as really marvelous, when we bear in mind the ceaseless en-deavors to make themselves notoriousat the expense of those who have obeyed that law. I say, when I look upon the results of all that has been said and done about it,I regard it as a marvel. If the hand of God has not been manifested in behalf of this people;I do not know where to look for it. [T]his kingdom will stand, God willplead with her strong ones, but Zionwill not be moved out of her place.Quite a remarkable thing has just happened—four cyclones start fromnear the same point, each taking a different course, the results of whichare known. God has nothing to do with them, says the world. Butthe judgments of God will be pouredout, and the spirit of unbelief willgrow in the hearts of the [p]eople, and they will be blind to his power until it is too late.J1175236 Brethren and sisters, seek after God; call upon him in your secretpl[a]ces, and do not turn away fromrighteousness and truth; there isnothing to be gained by doing that,but everything to lose.God bless you. Amen.

 HISTORYOF WILFORD WOODRUFF.-[FROM HIS OWN PEN.]-In tracing the history of my fathers, I find it difficult to obtain a satis-factory account of the Woodruff familyfor more than three generations.My great grandfather, Josiah Wood-ruff, lived nearly one hundred years,and possessed an iron constitution,and performed a great amount of manual labor nearly up to the time ofhis death. His wife's name was Sarah;she bore to him nine children, as follows: -- Josiah, Appleton, Eldad,Elisha, Joseph, Rhoda, Phebe, and two names not given.My grandfather, Eldad Woodruff,was the third son of Josiah. He wasborn in Farmington, Hartford co.,Connecticut, in 1751; he also posses-sed a strong constitution. It was said that he performed the most laborfor several years of any man in Hart-ford county, and from over exertion in hewing timber, he was attackedwith rheumatism in his right hip,which caused severe lameness forseveral years before his death. Hemarried Dinah Woodford, by whom he had seven children--viz., Eldad, Eli-zabeth, Samuel, Aphek, Titus, Helenand Ozem.Eldad married Lewey Woodford;Elizabeth, Amasa Frisby; Samuel,Miss Case; Aphek, Beulah Thompsonand Azubah Hart; Titus, LouisaAllen; Helen, Amos Wheeler; andOzem, Acksah Merrill and HannahHart; all of whom had large families.My grandfather died in Farming-ton, with the spotted fever, in 1806,aged 55 years. My grandmother, Dinah, died in 1824, in the same place,with a cancer in the left breast; hersufferings were very great.My father, Aphek Woodruff, was born in Farmington, Nov. 11, 1778;he married Beulah Thompson, who was born in 1782, Nov. 29, 1801.She bore three sons--namely, Azmon, born Nov. 29, 1802; Ozen Thompson,born Dec. 22, 1804; myself born1807-03-01March 1, 1807.My mother died with the spotted fever, June 11, 1808, aged 26 years,leaving me fifteen months old. Myfather's second wife, Azubah Hart, was born July 31, 1792; they weremarried Nov. 9, 1810; they had sixchildren--viz., Philo, born Nov. 29,1811, and died by poison administeredby a physician Nov. 25, 1827; AsahelHart, born April 11, 1814, and diedin Terrahaute, Oct. 18, 1838; Frank-lin, born March 12, 1816, and diedJune 1; Newton, born June 19, 1818,drowned Sept. 1820; Julius, bornApril 22, 1820, and died in infancy;Eunice, born June 19, 1821. I married her to Dwight Webster, in Farmington, Conn., Aug. 4, 1841.My father was a strong constitu-tioned man, and has done a great amount of labor. At eighteen years of age he commenced attending a flour- 
 ing and saw mill, and continued about 50 years; most of this time he laboredeighteen hours a day.He never made any profession ofreligion until I baptized him, with allhis household, into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, on the first day of July 1838. He was a man of great charity, honesty, inte-grity and truth, and made himself poorby giving to the poor, and accomoda-ting his fellow-men by loaning moneyand becoming surety for his neighbors,and always saying yes to every manwho asked a favor at his hand.I was born in the north part of the town of Farmington, now called Avon, Hartford co., Conn., March 1, 1807.I assisted my father in attending the Farmington Mills, until I was twentyyears of age.In April 1827, I took the flouring mill of my aunt, Helen Wheeler, which I attended three years. In May 1830, I took charge of the flour-ing mill of Mr. Colllins, the ax manu-facturer, in South Canton, Conn. Atthe end of one year it was demolishedto make way for other machinery. In March 1831, I took charge of the flouring mill owned by Mr. Richard B. Cowles of New Hartford, Conn. In the spirng of 1832, in company with my oldeset brother, Azmon, I went to Richland, Oswego co., NewYork, and purchased a farm and sawmill, and settled in business.(To be continued.) 
 DISCOURSEBy Elder Wilford Woodruff.  Tabernacle, Sun-day Afternoon Jan. 10, 1858----------[REPORTED BY J. V. LONG ]-----------While I meet with the Saints in this Tabernacleand partake of the sacrament with them, es-pecially with such a large body of people as thereare here in these valleys of the mountains, itleads my mind in a train of reflection and thought concerning this work in which we are engaged,and whether I think of it long or short, I havethe same feelings and come to the same con-clusions, and I say within myself, it is the work ofGod, and it is marvellous in my eyes.There is a marked difference between the workof God and the work of men, or the work of the devil, and that difference is manifest in the es-tablishment of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. There is one characteristicconnected with the work of God that has beenmanifested in its establishment in these last daysas in all former periods, and that is that wheneverthe Lord has attempted to establish his Church and Kingdom upon the earth he always makes use of instruments whose peculiar circumstancesin life will naturally lead them to acknowledge the hand of God in all that is manifested unto them. You have the example of all the Prophetsfrom the days of Adam, and as far as we have any knowledge of them they were nearly all menof low degree and of humble birth, and the Lordhas ever given them his Spirit to enlighten their minds, and to qualify them for the work assigned them. Men of this character have stepped forthand obeyed the Lord in various ages of the world,and they have given him the credit for what has been accomplished. This has been very clearlymanifested in our own day.Thirty years ago the 22nd day of last September,the Angel of God delivered unto the hands of Joseph Smith the plates containing the recordfrom which the Book of Mormon was translated, in which is recorded the history of the ancient in-habitants of this country.  Joseph Smith was a man of humble birth, and in one sense of theword he was poor and illiterate, and to look atthings naturally, it looked strange that the Lordshould undertake to build up his Church andKingdom with such a feeble instrument. Tosome this may look a very small matter, but thework was great, and here was an honest soul, andthe Lord made choice of that soul to give unto him the knowledge, the blessings and the gloryassociated with the coming forth of the Book of Mormon which should lay the foundation ofthe Church and Kingdom of God in these last days.What did that angel tell Joseph Smith whenhe gave him the plates? The vision of his mind was opened, and the Angel showed unto him the condition of the nations of the earth, and saidthis record which I now commit unto your hand contains the words of life, the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and the Lord is now about to establish hisKingdom upon the earth. The world are in darkness, the Gentiles have departed from thegospel of Jesus Christ; they have forsaken the light, the glory and the power of the priesthood of the son of God, which was given to and en-joyed by the Gentile nations when Israel was cut off.The Lord promised Joseph Smith at this earlyage that if he would obey his commandments and hearken to the voice of the Holy Spirit he would make him an instrument of bringing about thisgreat work, that the Church may be brought outof the wilderness of darkness and Error and myname glorified among men.The words that this record contains shall bepreached to every kingdom, tongue and people,and whenever this doctrine is preached your nameshall be had in honorable remembrance among the virtuous, the holy, the righteous and those who desire to do good, but the ungodly will vilify your character, hold up your name to ridiculeand scorn wherever the sound of this gospel goes, even to all nations.The Lord also told Joseph Smith, in the com-mencement of this work, as you will see by the revelations contained in the Book of Doctrine and Covenants, that he was laying the foundation of a great and mighty work and kingdom whichshould be the kingdom of God and it should notbe thrown down but stand for ever, but you can-not now comprehend the extent of it. The mind of the Prophet was opened by the Spirit of re-velation, so that he could see and comprehend agreat deal but he required the Spirit of the living God, the inspiration of the Almighty to rest uponhim continually to qualify him for the great dutiesthat were constantly increasing upon him, and the same Spirit is required by any man in thiskingdom, whether he be old or young, rich orpoor to enable him to bring about the work of God, or to do anything that is of much con-sequence as the upbuilding of this kingdom.The Prophet was repeatedly told of the im-portance of the work in which he was engaged,and was commanded to obey the voice of God inall things, and then he was told that all that hadbeen promised should be fulfilled. The Prophet saw the chains of darkness that were binding the souls of men, and although at that time he had not received the priesthood, yet the Lord mani-fested himself to him in various ways and at manytimes before he was ordained, or before therewere any baptized into the Church. In processof time, viz. on the 15th day of May, 1829, he andOliver Cowdery received the Aaronic Priesthood, and according to commandment they baptized each other. Then on the 6th day of April follow-ing the Church was organized, and the work of God established on the earth no more to be rootedout of it.What must have been the feelings of the Prophet when, the moment he began to unbosomhis thoughts, and to tell what the Lord had done for him, the Christian world began to mock andderide him. The devil opposed him, wicked menopposed him, and there was a spirit among thepeople to kick against the work of God, and there were whole communities that were opposed to thedoctrine of administration of Angels, and con-sequently, his path was rugged and thorny.—Sometimes he would come across individuals who would listen to his message, and would receive his testimony. This made his soul rejoice to seethat there were some persons who would receivethe words of eternal life.True, in the commencement this Church was small, and I frequently reflect upon what hascome to pass in the world since God spake toJoseph the Seer; I also look at what has taken place with this people, and I can clearly see the fulfilment of the word of God spoken by the Angel to Joseph before the Church was organized;the Angel fore told the very scenery that I behold to-day, and from that time to the present thispeople have been fulfilling what the Angel told the Prophet would come to pass after he gave tohim the plates containing the record of the Bookof Mormon. We are daily working for the fulfil-ment of those things that were predicted from twen-ty-five to thirty years ago; these very things that weare now witnessing both in relation to our friendsand our enemies are in fulfilment of thosepromises made in the commencement of this work.The Prophet's heart was made glad while he lived among us in beholding the signs of the times, and there are many here to-day who re-member the early days of this Church and King-dom. Some of the first Elders in this Church whowent up to Kirtland to see the Prophet were made to rejoice in his society. The Saints who weregathered together were so few that they might all have been put in a small schoolhouse, but where-ver the gospel had been preached some few had been brought to a knowledge of its truth andoccasionally a few had been gathered up to Kirtland, perhaps one of a family and two of a city.When brother Brigham and br. Jeseph Young went up to see the Prophet they found him chop-ping wood for he was a laboring man and gained his bread by the sweat of his brow, they made themselves acquainted with him; he received themgladly, invited them to his house and they rejoicedtogether in the gospel of Christ and their hearts were knitted together in the spirit and bond of union.Those of us who gathered to Kirtland in theearly days of the Church can re-member the scenes which happened in those days.  I well re-member the time when I first met the Saints in Kirtland, it was in the spring of 1834. I hadnever joined any Church previous to hearing thisgospel, and the first sermon I ever heard waspreached by br. Zera Pulsipher, one of the seniorPresidents of the Seventies, and my heart was made glad; I embraced the gospel for I knew it was the first gospel sermon that I had ever heard inmy life. I was baptized by brother Pulsipher,and shortly afterwards bro. Parley P. Pratt came along to gather up the warriors of the Lord to goup and redeem Zion.I was deeply engaged in business at the time,but I felt that it was my duty to do all I couldfor the cause of truth, and when br. Parley came up I felt resolved to volunteer. We called a meeting and when br. Parley got up and said hewas weary with traveling and did not want to saymuch, but he would talk a few moments, and when he got through it was about twelve o'clock at night; in fact he had preached about half thenight:—my feelings were such, when he got through, that if all the gold in the world had beenpresented to me I could not have been hired to stay at home. I went with br. Parley throughJefferson County, to the North, and then im-mediately prepared to go to Kirtland. I started to Kirtland on the 11th day of April 1834, andarrived in Kirtland on the 25th day of the samemonth. I then for the first time had an interviewwith the Prophet Joseph; he invited me to hishouse. I rejoiced to behold his face and to hear his voice.  I was fully satisfied that Joseph wasa Prophet before I saw him. I had no pre-judices on my mind against him, but I expectedto see a Prophet.My first introduction to him was rather singular,I saw him out in the field with his br. Hyrum; he had on a very old hat and was engaged shoot-ing at a mark. I was introduced to him and heinvited me home with him.I accepted the invitation, and I watched himpretty closely, to see what I could learn. He re-marked, while passing to his house, that this wasthe first hour he had spent in recreation for a longtime.Shortly after we arrived at his house he went into an adjoining room and brought out a wolf-skin, and said, 'br. Woodruff, I want you to help me to tan this,' so I pulled off my coat, went towork and helped him, and felt honored in so doing. He was about going up with the brethren to re-deem Zion, and he wanted this wolf's skin to putupon his wagon seat, as he had no buffalo robe.This was my first introduction to the Prophet Joseph Smith, the great Seer of this last dispen-sation.I was not there long before I heard him talkabout going to Zion, and it did my soul good tohear him speak of many things concerning Zion, the gathering of Israel and the great latter-day work, and I felt truly satisfied with what I saw and heard.I recollect that in the evening after I got there, several of the brethren came in and talked with br.  Joseph, and asked what they should do, forthey had not means to bear their expenses from there to Missouri. Br. Joseph said, 'I am going to have some money soon,' and the next morninghe received a letter containing a hundred and fiftydollars, sent to him by sister Voce of Boston; I don't know but she is in the congregation to-day.I have felt to rejoice exceedingly in what I saw of br.  Joseph, for in his public and private careerhe carried with him the Spirit of the Almighty, and he manifested a greatness of soul which I hadnever seen in any other man.The reason I speak of these things is because I want to refer to this congregation, and to this peo-ple generally as they have passed along, for truly, it has required a stretch of faith to be enabled tocomprehend the accomplishment of all that has been done for the last twenty-five years. The Lord said by revelation in an early day, 'The har-vest is ripe, and any man that desires in his heartto preach the Gospel and will thrust in his sickle, he is called of God.'The Elders that are called in this church, youcan notice in them the spirit and disposition topreach the Gospel and redeem the people from sin,tradition and error. At the commencement of thechurch, the Lord gave revelations to the church and to individuals, through the Prophet, totell them what to do, be baptized, ordained, go onmissions and anything that was required at their hands, and hence you can see in the Book of Doctrine and Covenants revelations given to Mar-tin Harris, Parley P. Pratt, Orson Pratt, theWhitmers, and many others, calling them to go forth and preach the Gospel to the world. In those revelations are promised many great andglorious things, and the pattern is given and the foundation laid for a great and mighty work—a work not to be accomplished in ten, twenty, thir-ty, forty, nor fifty years, but a work that em-braces the gathering together of all things whichare to be saved, both in heaven and on earth, andthe establishing of the kingdom of God, to remainfor ever; and the Lord said, you are laying the foundation for a great and mighty work. But we did not understand or comprehend its extent. He called upon us to go forth and warn the world of the judgments to come, and to call upon themto learn the ways of righteousness, and to walktherein, and what has been the result?Every man that has embraced it, whose heartwas honest before God, has been inspired by the Spirit of God; he has been ready to engage inthe work, to shoulder their knapsack, and go forthand preach this gospel to all people whenever anopportunity presented itself; and the first Eldersof this Church did preach diligently and faith-fully, and many received the word with gladnessand rejoiced in the truth.Finally brother Heber C. Kimball was called to goto England, as you learn by the Church History,and he laid the foundation of a great work, as theAngel declared to Joseph should be the case.The words of life that were engraven upon those plates have been preached to almost all na-tions; and have not the people had an opportuni-ty of hearing? They have in a great degree, for the servants of the Lord have been inspired to 
 DISCOURSE BY ELDER WILFORD WOODRUFF,DELIVERED AT THE FORTY-SIXTH ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE CHURCH OFJESUS CHRIST OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS, IN THE NEW TABERNACLE, SALTLAKE CITY, THURSDAY MORNING, APRIL, 6, 1876.(Reported by David W. Evans.)INFIDELITY OF THE CHRISTIAN WORLD—DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIESOF THE SAINTS—NECESSITY OF A TEMPLE, AND WORKS IN BEHALFOF THE DEAD."Who am I, saith the Lord, that I command and am not obeyed? Who am I, saith the Lord, that I promise and do not fulfill?" We have again the privilege of assembling ourselves together upon another An-nual Conference of the Church ofJesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and I hope and trust that, what time we may spend in Conference, our hearts may be lifted up unto the Lord, that his Holy Spirit may be given unto us, that we may be dictated and directed in our words, thoughts, acts, and teachings, in such a manner that we may be justified before him.We have said, time after time, and year after year, that we live in a very peculiar age, generation and dispensation, and this is true. Time rolls on, carrying with it its events, and fulfilling the revelations of God, unto us especially. We live in a day of darkness; unbelief and infi-delity are covering the whole face of the earth, until it seems as though the whole Christian world had lost all hold of faith in God and in his Son Jesus Christ, and in the Bible, 
 DISCOURSEBYELDER WILFORD WOODRUFF,Delivered at the Annual ConferenceSaturday a.m., April 6, 1878.REPORTED BY GEO F. GIBBS.THE very fact that we have a peo-ple, that we have a Zion, that we have a kingdom, that we have achurch and a priesthood which is connected with the heavens, andwhich has power to move the hea-vens, and that we know that theheavens are communicating withus, directing the performance ofthis great latter-day work in whichthe Latter-day Saints are engaged,this very fact alone should fill our hearts with humility before the Lord our God, and it should con-tinually remind us in our reflec-tions and feelings of the responsi-bility we are under both to Himand to one another, and also of ourdependence upon him for all theblessings we enjoy of a spiritual as well as a temporal nature.The prayer offered up by Brother Pratt filled my mind with reflec-tions of the past. Almost half acentury has expired since the Prophet of God organized thischurch upon the earth; but he andmost of the men who labored pro-minently with him, in laying the foundation of this church, are notwith us to-day, their voices are hushed in death, they have finish-ed their earthly work, having la-bored a series of years, and are nowthe other side of the vail. There are but two of the first quorum of the Twelve with us in the flesh, and only two of the second quo-rum. And this speaks in loud andforcible language, at least it doesto me, that what we have to do inthe interest of the great cause of salvation, we should perform itfaithfully and diligently, making the very best use of the few re-maining days we have yet to la-bor in the flesh.While I refer to the absence of our brethren whose works remainand whose memories are cherished,I am fully conscious this morningthat we who are left are not labor-ing alone, nor particularly for our own benefit, in a temporal point of view; but I realize that we are call-ed and ordained of God to laborwith him and the heavenly hosts,in the accomplishment of his pur-poses, the bringing forth and estab-lishing of his Zion and Kingdom inthe earth, and all that has been de-signed to be consummated in this the dispensation of the fullness of times. I also sense that when I and my brethren who still remainshall pass away, we shall go as others have done—we shall nottake this world or any part of it with us.  When Joseph Smith died,Nauvoo remained, he did not takeit with him; when President Brig-ham Young died, Salt Lake City still remained, and when we join them we shall leave behind us thethings of time, even as Jesus didhimself who was the founder of the earth. This truth itself should in-cite the Latter-day Saints to reflec-tion, it should indelibly impress upon our memories the fact thatwe are working for something fargreater, in real worth, than dollarsand cents, houses and lands and this world's goods. We have beengathered here in our present condi-tion by the commandment and by the inspiration of the Lord, to con-tinue the work that others com-menced, and like them we must improve the time in doing what is required of us, working faithfully for God and his Kingdom while the day lasts.I know, you know, and all Israelknows who have received the ful-ness of the everlasting gospel inthis last dispensation of God toman, that this is the work of God and not of man; we understandthis perfectly. This church and kingdom has been organized by theadministration of angels from God.The organization of this churchhas been governed and controlledby revelation and upon no otherprinciple, and what has already been accomplished since our exist-ence, as a church, reveals the han-diwork of God, for no man could have done what has been done un-less God were with him. I rejoice to have the privilege of meetingwith so many of my brethren andsisters, and that I have the privi-lege of bearing testimony to thedivinity of this latter-day work,and of the principles of salvation revealed from God to man.  The scene I behold this morning, and that which I behold in travelingthrough the extent of this Terri-tory, speaks to me in very loudlanguage that it is in fulfilment of the designs of God, and the revela-tions of Jesus Christ, which are re-corded not only in the Bible, or on the stick of Judah, but also in the Book of Mormon, or stick of Josephin the hands of Ephraim, as wellas in the New Testament, and those revelations of modern date asthose of ancient time, have been sealed with the blood of him who brought them forth, and this tes-tament therefore is in force to allthe world. The Lord is not trifling with this generation, neither is he trifling with the Saints or with the world of mankind. During the last 48 years the Gospel has beenpreached to this generation, and this work will continue preaching to the Gentiles, until the Lord directsotherwise. The harvest is ripe, and he, the Lord, said, through the Prophet Joseph, he that would thrust in the sickle and reap wascalled of God. And some have continued to labor faithfully almostfrom the organization of this Churchto the present time—almost half a century.  I think it a great bles-sing and privilege to stand in the midst of the people of God in this age of the world to preach the gos-pel of Jesus, and to labor to build up Zion, in obedience to his com-mandments, and to carry out his purposes in the day and age inwhich I live: We, as a whole peo-ple, should certainly exercise our faith in God and in the revelations, more especially those that immedi-ately refer to our present condition; no matter where they are found,in any of the records of divine truth.The Lord has said unto us, through Joseph Smith, that it matters notwhether he speaks unto the chil-dren of men by his own voice or bythe ministrations of angels, or whe-ther by the voice of his servants, that it is all the same, it is his word, his mind and his will to those to whomsoever it comes; and that although the heavens and the earth pass away, not one jot ortittle of his word shall remain un-fulfilled.I am a believer in this revelationand also in the records which areleft for us to pursue, the inspired words of ancient as well as modernprophets; and I also believe that they will have their fulfilment in the due time of the Lord, and that no power on earth can prevent it. And I do not believe there has been a revelation given from God to man, from the days of father Adam to this hour, but what has had its fulfilment, or will have, as fast astime will admit; and we are everyday of our lives making history,and we are also fulfiling the pro-phecies of Isaiah and many other ancient men of God, who were per-mitted in vision to see our day.I know we live in a day of infidel-ity; I know that darkness coversthe earth and gross darkness theminds of the people; I know that the Lord is angry with the wicked, and withholding his spirit from the inhabitants of the earth; I know that light has come into the world, and that men love darkness ratherthan light, because their deeds are evil. But as a servant of the living God I will say that, notwith-standing all the unbelief of this wicked generation—the Christian, the Jewish and the pagan world, together with the combined efforts of the devil and wicked men, thefulfilment of the purposes of Godin their times and seasons cannot be frustrated. These volumes of reve-lation are written on the pages of divine truth as in letters of fire, and they will have their fulfilment whether men believe or disbelieve, for they are the words of God.It is a great work, an almighty work; it is a work different fromthat of any dispensation whichGod has given to man. When Ilook upon these Latter-day SaintsI cannot help contemplating our calling and the labor re-quired at our hands, and, when I am reminded of the account that we have all got to give before the judgment seat of God for theuse we make of our own time andtalents, and the gifts of God and the holy priesthood, and the workof our God which has been com-mitted to us, I feel to ask, What manner of men ought we to be. Our souls should be open to thebuilding up of this kingdom of God, and we should continue with increased diligence to rear towardsheaven these temples of our God, the foundation of which we have laid and commenced to build upon, so that all Israel who dwell heremay enter into them and attend tothe ordinances of the house of God.And I again say to the Latter-day Saints, this work the God of Israelrequires at your hands. This re-quirement is not confined to the Twelve, the President of Stakes and the Bishops, but it is binding upon every man who has entered into covenant with the Lord ourGod, and I trust that one and all will willingly share this responsi-bility, and not for a moment per-mit this work to drag or appear la-borious to perform.I thank the Lord my God that my ears have been saluted with the sound of the Gospel, and that I have had the privilege of readingthe revelations of God to us, and I know that, as an individual, I am held responsible for my duty to Him. We have a harvest to reapboth sides of the vail. We have already done considerable work onthis side, by way of preaching theGospel to the nations of the earth,as commanded to do by God. Welldo I remember the early experienceof the first Elders of the Church, how we traveled afoot for thou-sands of miles, without purse or scrip, with valise in hand, and many times having to beg ourbread, from door to door, in order to impart to thepeople a knowledge of the Gospel.Our garments are clear from theblood of this generation, and the testimony of these elders will yetrise in judgment against this gen-ration to condemn them.  Not-withstanding the unbelief of the Christian world, and notwithstand-ng the warfare that may be wagedagainst God and his Christ, Zion will be redeemed and his kingdom will be established never more to be thrown down. He holds the nationsin his own hands, and he also has his Saints in his holy keeping, and he will continue to guide and direct and sustain his people, until they consummate all unto which theyhave been ordained.Look at these valleys! When we came here in 1847, they were bar-en and desolate, without the least sign or mark of civilization. To-day our Territory is filled with vil-lages, towns and orchards, and the land is brought under a good stateof cultivation, inhabited by a civil-ized race. Who are they? Sons and daughters of the Lord Almigh-ty; they are a people that have been,as corn sifted in a sieve, among the Gentile nations, and called outby the proclamation of the ever-lasting Gospel. The Lord chosea boy from the humble walks of life, and endowed him with intelli-gence and power to commence thisgreat work, and also to send forth others throughout this and to othernations bearing the messages of life, and this people opened their heartsto receive it, and were baptized in water for remission of sins, and re-ceived the laying on of hands forthe reception of the Holy Ghost. They have been born of the Spirit, and they have seen the kingdom of God, and they have received ordin-ation in order to enter into it. And when they enter into it, they have the spirit of it, and this makes thedifference between the Latter-daySaints and the former-day Saints. No man can see the kingdom of Godunless he is born of the Spirit; andthis is wherein these Latter-day Saints have faith in God, and ob-serve the signs of the times, and trust in him by this principle. Their prayers have ascended in the ears of the Lord of Sabbaoth, asking for things which they stood in need of; and he has answered our pray-ers and he has continued to sustainus until the present time.  I ask, my brethren and sisters, will theLord withhold now his hand, will he now close the heavens, with-drawing the power by which we have been upheld? No, he will not; his hand will continue over usif we be true to him and the lawshe has given unto us. He has de-creed before the foundation of thisworld, before the fall of man, that in the dispensation of the fulness of times, he would gather unto himself all things, both thingswhich are in heaven and things on the earth. He is doing it, although the world generally does not know it.Now, brethren and sisters, I donot wish myself to occupy all yourtime this morning, but I want to say to you that our position, our calling, our religon embrace thenoble work of God, both temporaland spiritual, which rests upon us.We have to go forth with our handsand build up Zion. Zion will be built up; Zion will be redeemed,and she will arise and shine and put on bet beautiful garments; she will break from off her neck her yoke, and she will be clothed withthe glory of our God. Zion hasbeen sold for naught; she will beredeemed without money; she willarise in her beauty and glory, as the prophets of God have seen her;she will extend her borders and strengthen her stakes, and the Godof heaven will comfort her, inas-much as we will unite together to carry out his purposes.I see nothing to tempt me or youto turn aside from the work given us to do. The prophets have pre-dicted that every weapon that is formed against Zion shall be brok-en, and this is in accordance withthe revelations of God to us. He will continue this work and directits onward course, but he expects us to continue to reclaim the waste places, and to con-tinue to build temples andalso to impart of our substance. And I wish all Israel to understandthat when we impart of our sub-stance to build temples that we do not do it to benefit the Lord at all, he had his endowments a long time before we were born, and alsopassed through his probation. Weare his children, he wishes to exalt us back to his presence, and he knows very well we are obliged to walk in the same path and receive the same ordinances in order toinherit the same glory that sur-rounds him. And when we erecttemples in which to perform ordi-ances for the living and the dead, we do it to benefit our own blessedselves. I want salvation, I wish toinherit eternal life, I wish to get back to the presence of God fromwhence I came, when I have fin-ished my probation in the flesh. And I believe that I desire nothingin this respect but what you also wish. Then I know that it requires my diligence and my con-tant labor and study, the littletime I have to spend in the flesh, todo all I can to build up Zion and to establish the church and the kingdom of God upon the earth. If we can only obtain eternal lives we shall attain to the greatestof God's gifts to man.  Our Savior,our Heavenly Father, the angelGabriel, Peter, James and John, Joseph Smith and Brigham Young,are not coming back to build ourtemples for us, they are not com-ing to settle new country and openup new roads, plant out our trees, build up and beautify this land, this is our part of the work, and we have got it to do, working whilewe live, and when we go away we shall move on exactly as others have done, leaving our houses our gardens, our flocks and herds, andall our earthly interests behind us. And when we go to the spirit world and our eyes are opened oneternal lives, we shall all marvel atthe way in which our lives havebeen spent. There is a vail overall the earth, it is ordained of God that it should be so, and the fact ofit being so will prove all of his children whether we will abide inhis covenant even unto death or not. And those who are not wil-ling to abide in their covenant untothe end for the building up of thekingdom of God, are not worthy of a place with God and with the Savior and those who bare sealedtheir testimony with their blood.I pray the Lord to bless you and all those who may attend this Con-ference, and also the brethren who may address you; and trust that our prayers may continually ascend into the ears of the Lord on behalf of Zion and her speedy redemption.I will say before closing, that Ihave just returned from St. George,where I have been laboring in theTemple. The work of God con-tinues there; as a general thing wehave as much labor as the Templeis capable of sustaining. The spiritof the work does not lag. And Ican safely add that just as quick as the people get the Temple done atthis place, the way will be opened before them, they will feel the re-sponsibility of attending to thework so essentially necessary to bedone on behalf of those who havelived and passed away without having had the privilege of receiv-ing the blessings of the Gospel; and as their time and attention will beoccupied in this direction will they perceive the importance as well asthe magnitude of the work. There are many to-day who stand in needof this assistance, and as I have often said, so say I again to this body of Latter-day Saints, that thislabor devolves upon us, and God requires it at our hands. The Pro-phet Joseph may turn the keys in the spirit world, and he and those engaged with him may preach tothe spirits in prison, but they can not baptize them nor confirm themnor administer offices of the endow-ment. Some person or personsdwelling in the flesh must attendto this part of the work for them;for it takes just as much to save adead man who never received the Gospel as a living man. And all those who have passed away with-out the Gospel have the right to expect somebody in the flesh to perform this work for them. Amen. 
 DISCOURSEBYELDER WILFORD WOODRUFF,Delivered at the Tabernacle, SaltLake City, Sunday, June 30, 1878.REPORTED BY GEO. F. GIBBS.There is a principle that I feel disposed to say a few words on, in connection with what brother Richhas been saying, and that is theprinciple of faith.[The speaker then read the ##Hebrews 11|11thchapter## of Hebrews.]I have taken the liberty of read-ing this catalogue of blessings which ancient men of God obtainedthrough the principle of faith; which principle is as much neededto-day by the people of this generation, as by any people at any age ofthe world. We might continue the chapter of results and operations of the principle of faith to the present day. For by faith JosephSmith received the ministration ofGod, out of heaven. By faith he received the records of Nephi, and translated them through the Urim and Thummim, into our ownlanguage; and which have sincebeen translated into many differentlanguages. By faith he made thefoundation of this church andkingdom, just as much as Noah,by faith, built the ark, and received the fulness thereof. [##Hebrews 11:7##] By faith he prophesied, leaving a record, a tes-tament which has been giventhrough his mouth to the inhabit-ants of the earth, and which con-tains the revelations of God yet to befulfilled. The testator is dead, but his testament is in force to all the world. By faith the elders of this church left their homes and fami-lies, and went, when called upon, to foreign nations without money and without learning or experience, to preach the Gospel of the Kingdom without price, to this generation,and warning the inhabitants of theearth of the judgments of God which await the world, and whichmust overtake the wicked. Faith is necessary on the part of the Latter-day Saints, say nothing about the outside world, in order to read and believe the records of divine truth which have come untous; and it requires faith on the partof the Christian world to really be-lieve this record, the Bible—to be-lieve that the Lord, through his servants, really means what hesays, and says what he means. Itrequires faith on the part of theLatter-day Saints to perform theirduties acceptably before God; for we, in this dispensation, must walkby faith and not by sight, just as much as the people of God in any previous dispensation. And thisprinciple we should exercise andlive by. Some of the revelations which God has given unto us pointto the future condition of the world, and foretell what must shortly be-fall the world of mankind. These predictions were uttered by holy men as they were moved upon by the Holy Ghost; and although themen themselves have passed away, not one jot or title of their words will fail in their fulfillment. Notwithstanding all the unbelief and infidelity of the modern world, there is not a man living that can place his finger upon the first revelation of God to man, from the days of father Adam to the present time,but what has had or is having itsfulfillment as fast as time and op-portunity admit of. God lives. These revelations which have beengiven through men who were in-spired of the Holy Ghost, will have their fulfilment, even if the results should effect the destruction of thegeneration now living. When Jesus brought the Gospel to his father's house—the Jews, they re-jected him and the words of life he taught them. He found themintently looking forward to thecoming of their Shiloh in the per-son of a king, a ruler who shouldpossess great power, even powersufficient to deliver them fromRomish yoke. They never once dreamed that he would appear intheir midst as the babe of Beth-lehem, who should be born in astable, and cradled in a manger, a man who should know sorrow, and who should be acquainted with grief, and who should choose as his disciples illiterate fishermen of lowdegree. [##Isaiah 53:3##] And although he was their Savior King who would haveredeemed them, and delivered them, and given unto them the gospel ofpeace and of liberty, yet they in their vanity and pride despisedhim, and persecuted him, and at last shed his blood. [##Matthew 27##] But was there aword ever uttered by him concern-ing their temple or nation but what met with i[t]s fu[l]filment to the very letter? The history of the Jews, which chronicles the days of their glory and power, when they held the Urim and Thummim, theephod, the priesthood, and when[t]hey offered sacrifice, taken in con-nection with the prediction of Jesus foretelling their downfall and dis-persion, is of itself sufficient to teachevery infidel mind, that there is truth in the revelations of God toman. The Jews have been tram-pled under the feet of the Gentiles for the last 1,800 years, fulfilling, too, what Moses said of them; and theyhave been overthrown as a nation, and led captive unto other nations,and are held in scorn by the Gentiles even to the present hour. And you may begin at the begi-ning, taking, for instance, thosegreat cities that figured anciently in their splendor and magnificence, and which were built to defy all time, such as Nineveh, Thebes,Tyre and Sidon, Memphis and Babylon. Where are they, and what become of them? They aregone, their history buried as itwere, in oblivion, and that too infulfillment of prophesy. Yes, the words of some poor honest prophet or apostle raised up to declare the Gospel to the inhabitants thereof, but whom they despised and rejected, have met with their fulfilment,and the disobedient and wicked have passed away to be judged according to the deeds done in the body. And you may trace the his-tory of the world from father Adam to the present time, and I can defyany man to point to a single pre-diction, uttered by inspired menraised up of God, but what has orwill come to pass in its time and season. And if the Gentiles to-day would read these revelations of God, and exercise faith in them,they would no longer wonder when they come among us, to see thesevalleys, for 600 miles, filled withcities and towns, gardens and or-chards, temples and tabernacles,and with comfortable dwellings.But the fact is, unbelief has over-whelmed the Christian world, andman has spiritualized the Scriptures until there is no faith in him, and he has no faith in God, nor in theliteral fulfilment of his revelations to man. That is what ails the world to-day. The predictions of the Bible never would have beenfulfilled, had not the Lord, in theselast days raised, up a prophet as aninstrument in his hands to again establish his Gospel on the earth, and gather together the house ofIsrael to the valleys of these ever-lasting hills, according to his de-cree to old father Jacob; and hisseed have yet to make this westerndesert to blossom as the rose, bring-ing forth "the fir tree, the pinetree, and the box together, to beau-tify the place of my sanctuary." [##Isaiah 60:13##]The whole history of this peoplehas beeen foretold by the prophet Isaiah, thousands of years ago; andit has been a steady growth from the commencement to the present. And will the Lord stop here? No; whether men believe or not, this Zion so often spoken of in holy writ, has got to arise and put onher beautiful garments; these mountain vales have got to befilled with the saints of God, and temples reared to his holy name, preparatory to the time when "the Gentiles shall come thy light, and kings to the brightness of thyrising." [##Isaiah 60:3##] And this time will comewhen the nations are fully warnedby the preaching of the servants ofGod, and his judgments commence to be poured out upon the world,in fulfilment of the revelations of St. John. Faith then is what the unbelieving world needs to exercisein God, and in his revelations toman; but as I have said, whetherwe do it or not, our unbelief willnever turn the hand of God to theright or the left.God has restored again his Gos-pel. He has raised up men andcommanded them to go forth andpreach it to the world, and they have been engaged doing so nowfor nearly half a century, eversince the organization of thisChurch. It was organized by revelation, with prophets apostles, pas-tors, teachers, helps and govern-ment, and the principles of it weretaught by revelation, the same as Jesus and the Apostles taught themin their day; and they are the sameas when they taught them, there isthere is no change whatever. The Lord never revealed but one Gospel tothe inhabitants of th[e] earth,in any age of the world, nor never will; the Gospel is the same yesterday, to-day, and forev-er, and the principles thereof arefaith in the Lord Jesus Christ, be-lieving that he is, and that he lived and died as a ransom for the sins of the world; and baptism for the re-mission of sins, being immersedand buried in water, by one havingauthority of God, that you may risein newness of life, in fulfilment of the testimony of Jesus, and thenreceive the Holy Ghost by the lay-ing on of hands, confirming be-lievers members of his Church. [##Hebrews 13:8##]And when you are born of the wa-ter and the Spirit, you can enter into the Kingdom of God, and being born of the Spirit, you can see theKingdom of God. And such be-lievers, when they receive the Holy Ghost receive the inspiration and revelation and light of it. Our eyes and ears may be de-ceived by the cunning and machi-nation of man; but the Holy Ghost never deceives anybody. It bearsrecord of the Father and the Son,and it bears record of the truths of the Gospel to those who possess it. The Lord never had a church on the face of the earth, from it first organization until to day, unless that church was organized by revel-ation, with prophets and apostles, pastors, teachers, helps and govern-ments endowed with the Holy Priesthood—that power delegatedfrom God to man, which authorizeshim to act for God; and withoutthis Priesthood no man, from theday the world rolled into existence has any right to administer in anyof the ordinances of his holy houseneither has any man a right to that Priesthood save he be called of Godas was Aaron who, we are informed, was called by revelation. [##Hebrews 5:4##] What ishis Priesthood for? It is to ad-minister the ordinances of the Gos-pel, even the Gospel of our Fatherin heaven, the eternal God, the Eloheim of the Jews and the God of the Gentiles, and all he has ever done from the beginning has beenperformed by and through the power of that Priesthood, which is"Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither be-ginning of days, nor end of life," [##Hebrews 7:3##]and the administration of his ser-vants holding this priesthood isbinding, being the savor of life un-to life or death unto death. It wasby virtue of this priesthood thetwelve apostles anciently went in-to the world to preach the Gospel, and it was because of this priest-hood which they held that men, in rejecting then, rejected Him whosent them and consequently brought upon themselves condemn-ation. Light has again come into the world; but men love darkness rather than light because their deedsare evil. [##John 3:17-19##] Hence condemnationrests down upon the world, for theconsequences of rejecting the Gospelmust overtake the world in this the last dispensation, just as much asthey did in former ones, in the daysNoah and Lot and those of theSavior.As I before stated, so say I again, the Gospel of Christ requires faithall the day long, for no man can continue faithful to the end with-out it. God has set his hand a second time to build up that kingdom which Daniel was permitted to see in vision, and to establish that Zionin the mountains which Isaiah saw. [##Daniel 2:26-47##] [##Isaiah 60##]He has set his hand, for the lasttime, to gather together all things which are in heaven and on earthwhich are in Christ, unto himself. [##Ephesians 1:10##]The day has come when the Lord has sent forth a proclamation towarn the nations to prepare for his second coming; and the signs ofboth heaven and earth all indicate the coming of the Son of Man, which is near at the door. No man knows the day or the hour when Christ will come, but the genera-tion is clearly pointed out, the figtree is leaving, and great changes are near at hand.  [##Matthew 24:32-36##] Great Babylon iscoming in remembrance before God,and the Lord has called upon theinhabitants of the earth, who are very wicked, to repent of their sins an[d] turn unto him. The genera-tion in which we live is a wicked and an adulterous generation, andwickedness and abomination of ev-ery kind are increasing, and theearth has commenced to groan un-der the evil practices of man. Theheavens are in pain over the diso-bedience and unrighteousness of the children of men, and the an-gels, we are told, are waiting in their places in the Temple for the time to come when they will becalled upon to go forth and reap down the earth. Judgments await the world, but they heed not, andapparently do not care. With fire and sword the Lord will plead with all flesh, and as the prophet has said respecting this event, "theslain of the Lord will be many;"and these things will overtake theworld in an hour when they expect them not, when they will be cry-ing peace, but alas, peace will have departed from them, and they left todevour and destroy each other. [##Isaiah 66:16##] Allthese things are foretold and many of them are written in these revelations given in our day, and they are already being fulfilled before our eyes; and they will continue to be fulfilled, until all that is spoken of shall have come to pass. There-fore, I want to say to the Latter-daySaints; Exercise faith in God, andexercise faith in his revelations, and read them and ponder over themand pray earnestly that you may have a correct understanding of all that God has revealed, that you may grow in the light and knowledge of God, and see the import-ance of living your religion and ofliving uprightly before Him; for all men, both Jew and Gentile, saint and sinner, will be judged ac-cording to the deeds done in thebody, and for the opportunitieswhich we have of informing ourselves of the will of God concerning us, which we allow to go unim-proved, we cannot be held guiltless.It certainly becomes us, who havenamed the name of Christ, to walk uprightly before God, for we cannot escape his chastening hand if we reject the light we have receiv-ed. Our condemnation will befar greater than those who neverembraced the principles of the Gospel, if we apostatize, or through in-different carelessness we allow the cares and things of this world to choke down the good seed planted.We have "tasted the good word ofGod, and the powers of the world to come;" we "know the Master's will," and if we do it not we will be "beaten with many stripes." [##Hebrews 6:5##] [##Luke 12:47##]The religious world talk about non-essentials. There are no such things existing in the Gospel of the Lord Jesus. He requires us to obey thesame laws that he himself obeyed, and which he taught in his day. Why did he go into the Jordan to be baptized of John? To fulfill allrighteousness. [##Matthew 3:13-17##] It was a righteouslaw, it belonged to him, and his example is in force to all the world.No man can enter into the King-dom of God except he is born ofthe water and of the Spirit. [##John 3:5##] Men maybe judged and their bodies lie in thegrave until the last resurrection, to come forth and receive of a telestial glory; but no man will receive of of the celestial glory except it bethrough the ordinances of the House of God. Jesus performed that act that he might set the example; he was the way for others to follow.The Jews, as I have said, rejected him and the Gospel he brought to them, and they shed his blood. They have been paying the penalty of their misdeeds for the last 1800 years. It costs something to shedinnocent blood, it costs something to shed the blood of prophets andapostles. And I have sometimes taken the liberty, before strangers as well as Latter-day Saints, to expressmy views in regard to shedding theblood of Joseph Smith and other prophets. It has cost this nation four years' war, laying in the dustnearly a million and a half of men,and it has also cost millions uponmillions of dollars, creating a debt which it will never live to pay. This is the faith of Wilford Wood-ruff, and I think I have a right to exercise my faith in this matter. I say then, it costs something to shedthe [b]lood of righteous men in thisas well as in previous generations.My testimony is that judgments await Babylon, judgments await the Christian world, and if people will read their Bible, they will see these declarations written down, and these judgments will increase until the world is cleansed from wickedness. And I say to all the world, Repent of your sins, and be baptized for the remission of them, that you may receive the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands, and besaved in the Kingdom of God. Without complying with these re-quirements, you nor I can never gowhere God and Christ dwell, worldswithout end, for these things havebeen made known to us by ancient and modern prophets.Therefore, your as well as my eternal destiny, our future positionthroughout the ages of eternity, de-pend upon the few hours, the fewdays, the few weeks we spend in the flesh. If I ever obtain a fullsalvation it will be by my keeping the laws of God. If I sin against God and man, I shall have to foot thebill; it will be so with you and with the whole world. This is the Gos-pel of Jesus Christ; this is the Zion of God, and what you see already accomplished in this desert land is really in fulfilment of the revela-tions of God. The hand of God has guided this Church from its in-cipiency to the present time. God will continue to direct its affairs,and there is no power on the earth or under the earth that can ever stop its progress, for He, himself,has decreed that the Zion of thelatter-days shall never be over-thrown; but on the contrary, as hehas said, through the mouth of the prophet Isaiah, "For the nation and the kingdom that will not serve thee shall perish; yea, those nations shall be utterly wasted." [##Isaiah 60:12##] Pretty strong doctrine to be taught by a humble man of God. Neverthe-less, time will bring it about and it is not in the power of man to pre-vent it. I am a believer in revela-tion. I am a believer, from thecrown of my head to the soles of my feet, with every particle of spir-it in me, that God will bring about, literally and to the very letter, all that he has spoken through his ser-vants, ancient and modern.By way of concluding my re-marks I wish to bear testimony tothis congregation and to the stran-gers present, that Joseph Smith wasa prophet of the living God; he wasraised up by the Lord, and laid thefoundation of this Church. Helived to accomplish the work he was raised up to do. He received the keys of the Priesthood from un-der the hands of Peter, James and John, and those pertaining to thegathering of scattered Israel, from under the hands of Moses, the lead-er of ancient Israel. [##Doctrine and Covenants 27:12##] Elijah, or Elias also visited him and bestowed upon him the keys to "turn the hearts of the fathers to the children,and the heart of the children to the fathers," which was in fulfilment of a prediction by the Prophet Mal-achi. [##Malachi 4:6##] He also received the keys ofthe Aaronic Priesthood under the hands of John the Baptist, whichPriesthood pertains to the temporal government of the Church. Afterperforming his work he sealed his testimony with his blood, passedbehind the vail, and he with hisbrethren who have also gone, is stillengaged in carrying on the same great work. He still labors by vir-tue of this priesthood which he re-ceived on earth, and which he will continue to hold, worlds without end. And this will be the case with every faithful man of Godwho magnifies his calling and priesthood here below.May God bless you, my brethren and sisters and friends, with his Holy Spirit, and give you faith in Him, and in his revelations, thatyou may be led to do his will whileyou live upon the earth. Butwhether you live to be thus favoredor not, my testimony is that they will have their fulfilment. Even so, amen. 
 DISCOURSE BYAPOSTLE WILFORD WOODRUFF,At Nephi, Saturday Afternoon,Jan. 27, 1883.REPORTED BY GEO. F. GIBBS.WE meet with the Saints of the several Stakes at the Stake Quarter-ly Conferences for the purpose of giving instruction which all needin order to qualify themselves to magnify their calling as Saints of God, engaged in establishing andbuilding up the Church and King-dom of God. And I will here say, as I have often said, that all men, and all women, regardless of the position they occupy, or the officethey hold, are dependent upon theLord for His Spirit to assist them intheir labors.I made a covenant with the Lord, years ago, that whatever He wouldimpress me to say, I would preach to the people. If we are not able tospeak to your edification, it is not because there are not truth and knowledge, principles and laws suf-ficient within the pale of this Church, and connected with the work in which we are engaged. I look upon the cause of God and the mission that He has given each ofus connected with it, as requiringthe whole attention, the might,mind and strength of each one of us, in order to magnify our calling and accomplish the work committedto our hands.The Lord raised up Joseph Smithspecially to do the work that he per-formed. He was ordained and ap-pointed before he was born to comeupon the stage of action in this age of God's mercy to man, throughthe loins of ancient Joseph who was a descendant of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, to lay the foundation of this great and glorious dispen-sation—a dispensation that will be marked and distin-guished in the annals of humanhistory for its grand and mighty, as also its serious and awful events.The day has already dawned when the light of heaven is to fill the earth; the day in which the Lord has said that nothing should be kepthidden, whether it be things per-taining to one God, or many Gods, or to thrones, principalities or pow-ers; the day in which everythingthat has been kept from the know-ledge of man ever since the founda-tion of the earth, must be revealed; and it is a day in which the ancientprophets looked forward to with agreat deal of interest and anxiety.It is a day in which the Gospel is to be preached to every nation, tongueand people for a witness of what shall follow; a day in which the Is-rael of God who receive it in theirdispersed and scattered conditionare to gather together to the placeappointed of God, the place wherethey will perform the "marvelouswork and a wonder" spoken of by the ancients who, in vision, saw our day; and where they will begin to inherit the promises made to thefathers respecting their children. The work that is to be so marvelousin the eyes of men has already com-menced, and is assuming shape and proportions; but they cannot see it.It will consist in preaching the Gos-pel to all the world, gathering theSaints from the midst of all those nations who reject it; building up the Zion of God; establishing per-manently in the earth His king-dom; preparing for the work of the gathering of the Jews and the events that will follow their settle-ment in their own lands, and in preparing for ourselves holy placesin which to stand when the judgments of God shallovertake the nations. This is trulya good work; and it is a marvel(when we look at it with our naturral eyes) how this people are sustained in their faith and hope of accomplishing it, besides having toprovide for the wants of themselves and families, which is of itself asmuch as most men can accomplish.We cannot do the work which God through us intends to have done,unless we place ourselves under Hiscare and direction, and take the sen-timent, "The Kingdom of God, or nothing," for our motto, as well asthe end and aim of our life. Thiswe must do to be truly the servants of God. We cannot serve God and mamon. We cannot build up theKingdom of God and withhold our hearts from Him. We must either come under the dominion of Godand be led and directed by Him, or under the dominion of Satan, and[b]e ruled over by him. It is for us, through our faith and works, our desires and course of life, to choose which we will take, as we must take the one side or the other.Nobody in this world has cause to rejoice as we have. None have the encouraging future before them that we have; for Zion is not to bemoved out of her place, neither is"the kingdom" to be given to an-other people. God rules and reigns, and we are His people, and He is our God.This work, this marvelous workand a wonder, the work that willeventually fill the whole world—andneither man nor the devil can pre-vent it—commenced, as all theworks of our God begin, in a small way. It was likened by the Saviorto the mustard seed, the smallest of all seeds, put in the soil, which grewuntil the fowls of the air could lodge in the branches thereof. Thiscertainly is the characterestic ofthis Church and Kingdom, com-mencing as it did on the 6th day of April, 1830, with only six members.But the Lord told Joseph in one ofthe revelations that he was layingthe foundation of a great work, how great he knew not. Joseph wasyoung at that time, and could notcomprehend fully the nature of the work which he had been called andappointed to commence in the earth.When Joseph presented to the Christian world the principles thatGod had communicated to him, heat once aroused their prejudices; he had to struggle against traditions which they had inherited from their fathers who knew not God nor His ways, traditions which had comedown to them through the ages,which were antagonistic to the sav-ing truths of heaven. And hence his life was one continual struggle, meeting with opposition on every hand, especially from the priests of the day; but he lived through it and rejoiced greatly in his labors un-til he finished his testimony in the flesh, after laboring some fourteenyears to that end. He had to wade through deep waters; but he neverwas discouraged or disheartened,notwithstanding he had to contendagainst foes without and foes within. He never lost sight of the majestyof his calling, nor the divinity of thiswork; but spake and acted in the midst of the people under all cir-cumstances the man that he was—the Prophet of God, the Seer andRevelator of the last dispensation.He left us under painful circum-stances, sealing his testimony with his blood; but his works follow him. The Gospel of the Kingdom whichhe preached, flourished under the wise administration of God's ser-vants who followed him. The Lordblessed and sustained His Apostles,and led them to this land, wherethe standard of Zion has been planted, which begins already toattract the notice of the nationsafar off. And here in this land, not-withstanding the difficulties wehave had to wrestle with, incidentto settling a new country a thous-and miles from civilization, havingalso to protect ourselves against theraids of the wild and untutored In-dians, the Lord has prospered us, and blessed us on every hand; and we are to-day a blessed people. Yetthe Christian world is opposed to us, and the Christians generally hateus. The Savior himself had thesame spirit and feeling to contendagainst. There was no man more unpopular than He; no man morepersecuted than He. And why? Be-cause He preached false doctrine?No. The real reason was, as He himself declared, because they loveddarkness better than light, becausetheir deeds were evil. There are but the two powers, that of God andthat of the devil. There is but theone true and living God, and He is our Eternal Father, the creator ofthis earth; and He will give it toHis children to inherit.We are nearing the end of the 6ththousandth year. We have the history, or a partial history, of thedealings of God with the nations from the day of Father Adam downas contained in the Bible and the Book of Mormon, from which we may learn many valuable lessons.God has raised up at different ages certain men to do a certain work, asHe raised up father Abraham. Hewas a noble spirit, we are told, be-fore he left the realms of glory to come and tabernacle in the flesh. He had the spirit of the Gods withhim when he was born; and he was faithful to God, and He had con-fidence in him; and whatever God required at his hands, he performed. So with Enoch. He stood at thehead of the dispensation in which he lived. He, in the course of time, some 350 years, built and perfectedthe city called Zion. He, however, met with all kinds of opposition from the people among whom helabored; but the power of God wasmanifested to such an exten[t] that his enemies stood and trembledthrough fear; and through that power he was enabled to performthe mighty work which he and his people did; it was not because the devil and his party were any more kindly disposed towards the Saints of God, but because they could not help themselves; and in the wisdom of God Enoch and his people and their city were taken away from the earth.The devil in different ages hasmade war against the Saints and overcome them; and he has tried his best to destroy this Church andKingdom. As I have said, Joseph and the first Elders met with the fiercest kind of opposition; but, with some exceptions, we have stood itall, and are the better to-day forhaving passed through the fire.When we went upon our first for-eign mission, Joseph said to us, "Nomatter what may come upon you, round up your shoulders and bear it, and always sustain and defend the interests of the Church andKingdom of God. When we took our departure his demeanor in part-ing was something that I had never noticed or experienced before. After crossing the Mississippi River I crawled to the side of a house and lay down upon a side of sole leather,while suffering from the chills andfever. While resting there the Prophet Joseph came along and saw me. He gave me some parting ad-vice in answer to some remarks made, and then told me to get up and go on, and all would be well with me. That is the way I partedwith him upon that occasion. From that day to this I have noticed the steady growth and increase of thispeople. We have nothing else to dobut to build up the Kingdom of God. If we do this He will keep us andprovide for us. We want to laboras a body of Priesthood, to enter in-to the holy of holies; we want tocome before God and pray until we get the spirit of this work, until we comprehend our calling before God.There has never been such a dis-pensation upon the earth as thepresent one. In other dispensations men had to lay down their lives,and others to hide up in dens andcaves of the earth, and wander insheep skins and goat skins, for theword of God. We have had a tasteof the same treatment in our day. And we have also seen days of poverty. When for instance, weleft to go on our first English mis-sion, two dollars would have bought everything I left to feed and clothe my wife and children. I hardly had aday's provisions in my house. It was a good deal so with my brethren; but we did not stay to nurse our wives. Those were the days of ourpoverty; and we never knew whatit was to be comfortably well off un-til we came to these valleys of the mountains. We had a great many trials in those days o[r] what we call-ed trials. I want to get this princi-ple into your minds, that God Al-mighty is guiding the course of thisChurch and Kingdom, and not we;and He has organized it for this day and generation and it never will be rooted out of the earth again.The Prophet Joseph knew what hewas doing; in fact, he knew much more than he dared to tell on ac-count of the prejudice, traditions, and unbelief of the people. I used to have peculiar feelings about hisdeath and the way in which his life was taken. I felt that if, with the consent and good feelings of thebrethren that waited on him afterhe crossed the river to leave Nauvoo, Joseph could have had his desire, he would have pioneered the way to the Rocky Mountains. But since then I have been fullyreconciled to the fact that it was ac-cording to the programme, that itwas required of him, as the head of this dispensation, that he shouldseal his testimony with his blood, and go hence to the spirit world, holding the keys of this dispensa-tion, to open up the mission that isnow being performed by way ofpreaching the Gospel to the "spiritsin prison." But those who shed his blood, and the people and nationwho sanctioned it in their hearts,have that to meet, and they can nomore escape the penalty thereofthan they can escape the death ofthe body. My views and feelings in regard to the Twelve and leading men of this Church have been this, that when they leave this stage ofaction they will be permitted to liedown in peace surrounded by their families and friends; and also, thatGod will never require them to stain their hand with the blood of their fellow men, in orderto protect themselves from violence;but, that the Lord will fight our bat-tles, and frustrate the measures thatwould lead to such an issue. Andthe wisdom of this is manifested in the fact part of our duty is to build Temples, and officiate in the same;and this we could not do so accept-ably to God if our hands were stain-ed with the blood of our fellowmen, even in our own defense. Hence I believe that God will cause the wicked to slay the wicked; and that He will cut off our enemies by judgment from time to time, as it shall be deemed prudent by Him. All is peace in Zion, and I thankGod for it. I am reminded of a saying made by Brother Cannonupon entering the well furnished parlor of one of President Merrill'shouses, of Richmond, in CacheCounty. "What," he said, "all this and heaven too?" Yes, God in-tends to give to His Saints the good things of the earth, as well as the blessings of heaven, as they shallbecome able to use them properly,and in his fear.The Lord intends to build up His Zion through us His weak and feeble creatures. He intends to make Zion strong and powerful inthe earth. He will bless us withmeans, and He will put it into ourhearts to build Temples to Hisname, in which His Saints mayperform the work that is required attheir hands in redeeming theirdead.Brethren and sisters, you should live by faith, realizing every day that all power rests with God, and that it is through Him that we are able to live in peace and enjoy plenty; that it is through Him thewrath of our enemies is turned asidefrom time to time, and that it will be through Him that the remainderof their wrath will be restrainedYou should enter your secret closets, and call upon the name of the Lord.Many of you have learned how topray; then fail not to let your prayers ascend up into the ears ofthe God of Sabaoth; and He willhear you. I think sometimes thatwe do not fully comprehend the power that we have with God inknowing how to approach Him ac-ceptably. All that these men hold-ing the Priesthood, and all that oursisters need do, is to live near to God, and call upon Him, pouring out their soul's desires in behalf of Is-rael, and their power will be felt, and their confidence in God will be strengthened. But the blessings of heaven can only be obtained and controlled upon the principles ofrighteousness. I have heard the Prophet Joseph pray when the pow-er of God rested down upon him, and all who heard him felt it; and I have seen his prayers answered in a marvelous manner almost immedi-ately. Governor Reynolds on one occasion employed men to try and kidnap Joseph, and they almost ac-complished their designs, b[u]t Josephhad some Gentile friends as wellas his brethren, through whom he was rescued, and was taken to Nauvoo and released under a writ of habeas corpus. But the Governorcontinued to harass him with writs, and was determined to destroy Jos-eph. Joseph and the Twelve went before God in prayer, Joseph kneel-ing before the Lord offered up pray-er, and asked God to deliver him from the power of that man.Among other things he told theLord that he was innocent before Him, and that his heart was heavyunder the persecutions he endured. In about forty-eight hours fromthat time word reached Joseph thatReynolds had blown his brains out. Before perpetrating the deed he left a note on his desk stating, that ashis services were not appreciated bythe people of the State, he took thatcourse to end his days.There is another instance that oc-curs to my mind. A certain man took a stand against Joseph, and en-deavored to bring persecution on him. He went to his God and laidthe matter before Him, asking to be delivered out of the hands and power of that wicked man. Josephwas a Prophet, a Seer, a Revelator.He was acquainted with God; he knew the voice of the Spirit when itspoke to him. After offering up hisprayer, the whispering of the stillsmall voice came to him saying, "Wait with patience." The next day that man was taken sick with cholera, and died in a few hoursSee how quickly the Lord answered his prayer offered up while a pris-oner in Liberty Jail. At that time, Presidents Young, Taylor and sev-eral of the Twelve were on their waythrough Clay County to lay the cor-ner stones of the Temple, in fulfill-ment of the revelation given in the Doc-trine and Covenants, section 118. Joseph had no sooner called upon God than he was liberated; and hisprayer answered to the very letter.The voice of the Spirit again spoketo him, speaking peace to his soul,and telling him that his troublesshould be of short duration. It was but a few days when he had the pleasure of shaking hands with hisbrethren, and enjoying the society of his family and friends. Joseph lived to accomplish the workthat was required of him notwith-standing the persistent and deter-mined opposition that he had to contend against. And after his death the work still went on, Godand His angels all the while guidingand sustaining by His Spirit the Prophet Brigham. And He will continue to sustain His servants; and through them and His peopleIsrael He will bring to pass thegreatest and grandest work that the world has ever known. It is for us to wake up to a sense of our duty, andcall upon the Lord in humility, andlive near to Him; and our eyes will be opened, as in the case of theyoung man, the servant of theancient Prophet Elisha, and we willsee that there are more for us thanagainst us; and that the element of opposition tends only to hasten thefulfillment of the purposes of God. Put your trust in God and rely onHis promises, living up to the lightand knowledge you possess; and allwill be well with you whether livingor dying.   God bless you, Amen.

 THE DESERET WEEKLY.Truth and Liberty.No. 18. SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH, APRIL 21, 1894. VOL. XLVIII.THE LAW OF ADOPTION.Discourses delivered at the General Conference of the Church, in theTabernacle, Salt Lake City, Sunday morning, April 8, 1894, byPRESIDENTS WILFORD WOODRUFF and GEORGE Q. CANNON-[REPORTED BY ARTHUR WINTER.]-PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF.I feel thankful for the privilege ofmeeting with so many of the Latter-daySaints this morning. In order to pre-sent my position before the Saints Iwish to say that I have been a memberof the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints over sixty years, a memberof the Quorum of the Apostles fifty-five years, and the President of the Churchfor a short time. During all these years,and in all my travels, I have never seena moment when I have had the powerto preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ orto administer in any of the ordinancesof the House of the Lord, acceptably toGod or to myself, only by the assistanceof the Holy Ghost; and I do not knowof any other man that could ever dothis. Even the Son of God, in referringto His work, said: "I do nothing of my-self; but as my Father hath taught me,I speak these things." [##John 8:28##] So it has beenwith all the prophets and patriarchs inevery age of the world; they have hadto be assisted by the power of God. Ioccupy that position today before thisassembly. Therefore, as the Lord com-manded us not to speak only as we aremoved upon by the Holy Ghost, Idesire that, and in order to obtain it Iwant the prayers and faith of the Latter-day Saints.I have some things resting upon methat I wish to present before the Latter-day Saints, and in order to do this I willcall upon President George Q. Cannonto read from the Book of Doctrine andCovenants concerning the subject whichI wish to speak upon.-[President Cannon read from sec. 128,as follows:It may seem to some to be a very bold doc-trine that we talk of—a power which records orbinds on earth, and binds in heaven.  Never-theless in all ages of the world, whenever theLord has given a dispensation of the Priesthoodto any man by actual revelation, or any set ofmen, this power has always been given.  Hence,whatsoever those men did in authority, in thename of the Lord, and did it truly and faith-fully, and kept a proper and faithful record ofthe same, it became a law on earth and inheaven, and could not be annulled, accordingto the decrees of the great Jehovah. This is afaithful saying! Who can hear it?And again, for the precedent, ##Matthew 16:18-19|Matthew xvi. 18, 19##, "And I also say unto them, that thouart Peter: and upon this rock I will build mychurch; and the gates of hell shall not prevailagainst it; and I will give unto thee the keys ofthe kingdom of heaven, and whatsoever thoushalt bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven;and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth, shallbe loosed in heaven."Now the great and grand secret of the wholematter, and the summum bonum of the wholesubject that is lying before us, consists in ob-taining the powers of the Holy Priesthood.For him to whom these keys are given, there isis no difficult in obtaining a knowledge offacts in relation to the salvation of th childrenof men, both as well for the dead as for the living.Herein is glory and honor, and immortalityand eternal life. The ordinance of baptism bywater, to be immersed therein in order to an-swer to the likeness of the dead, that one prin-ciple might accord with the other. To beimmersed in the water and come forth out of the water is in the likeness of the resurrectionof the dead in coming forth out of their graves;hence this ordinance was instituted to form arelationship with the ordinance of baptism forthe dead being in likeness of the dead.Consequently the baptismal font is insti-tuted as a simile of the grave, and was com-manded to be in a place underneath where theliving are wont to assemble, to show forth theliving and the dead; and that all things mayhave their likeness, and that they may accordone with another; that which is earthly con-forming to that which is heavenly, as Paul hathdeclared, ##1 Corinthians 15:46-48|I Corinthians XV. 46, 47, and 48##."Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual,but that which is natural, and afterwards thatwhich is spiritual. The first man is of theearth, earthy; the second man is the Lord,from heaven. As is the earthy, such are theyalso that are earthy: and as is the heavenly,such are they also that are heavenly."  And asare the records on the earth in relation to yourdead, which are truly made out, so also are therecords in heaven. This therefore, is the seal-ing and binding power and in one sense of theword, the keys of the kingdom which consist inthe key of knowledge.And now, my dearly beloved brethren and sisters, let me assure you that these are prin-ciples in relation to the dead, and the living,that cannot be lightly passed over, as pertainingto our salvation.  For their salvation is neces-sary, and essential to our salvation, as Paulsays concerning the fathers "that they withoutus cannot be made perfect," neither can wewithout our dead be made perfect.And now, in relation to the baptism for thedead, I will give you another quotation of Paul,##1 Corinthians 15:29|I Corinthians XV, 29##, "Else what shall they dowhich are baptized for the dead, if the dead risenot at all; why are they then baptized for thedead?"And again, in connection with this quotation,I will give you a quotation from one of theprophets, who had his eye fixed on the restora-tion of the Priesthood, the glories to be revealedin the last days, and in an especial manner this;most glorious of all subjects belonging to theeverlasting gospel, viz., the baptism for thedead; for Malachi says, ##Malachi 4:5-6|last chapter, verses 5thand 6th##, "Behold, I will send you Elijah theprophet, before the coming of the great anddreadful day of the Lord; and he shall turn theheart of the fathers to the children, and theheart of the children to their fathers, lest I comeand smite the earth with a curse."I might have rendered a plainer translationto this, but it is sufficiently plain to suit mypurpose as it stands. It is sufficient to know,in this case, that the earth will be smitten witha curse, unless there is a welding link of somekind or other, between the fathers and thechildren, upon some subject or other, and be-hold what is that subject?  It is the baptism forthe dead. For we without them cannot bemade perfect; neither can they without us bemade perfect. Neither can they nor we, bemade perfect, without those who have died inthe gospel also; for it isnecessary in the usher-ing in of the dispensation of the fulness of times;which dispensation isnow beginning to usherin, that a whole and complete and perfectunion, and welding together of dispensations, and keys, and power, and glories should takeplace, and be revealed from the days of Adameven to the present time; and not only this, butthose things which never have been revealedfrom the foundation of the world, but havebeen kept hid from the wise and prudent, shallbe revealed unto babes and sucklings in thisthe dispensation of the fulness of times.Now, what do we hear in the gospel whichwe have received? "A voice of gladness!  Avoice of mercy from heaven; and a voice oftruth out of the earth; glad tiding for the dead;a voice of gladness for the living and the dead;glad tidings of great joy; how beautiful uponthe mountains are the feet of those that bringglad tidings of good things; and that say untoZion, behold! thy God reigneth.  As the dews of Carmel, so shall the knowledge of God descent upon them."And again, what do we hear?  Glad tidingsfrom Cumorah! Moroni, an angel from heaven,declaring the fulfillment of the prophets—thebook to be revealed. A voice of the Lord inthe wilderness of Fayette, Seneca county, de-claring the three witnesses to bear record of thebook. The voice of Michael on the banks ofthe Susquehanna, detecting the devil when heappeared as an angel of light. The voice ofPeter, James and John in the wilderness be-tween Harmony, Susquehanna county, andColesville, Broome county, on the Susquehannariver, declaring themselves as possessing the [##Doctrine and Covenants 128:19-20##]

 INFIDELITY OF THE CHRISTIAN WORLD, ETC. 187the revelations of God to man. And this being the case, if the Lord has any people on the face of the earth, they should be increasing in faith inhim. You let a Christian come here, no matter who, whether he be a minister, professor, or believer, orany one who professes to believe in the Bible, and let him ask an Elderin Israel—"Do you really believe, inyour soul, sincerely before the Lord, that Mormonism is true?" Whenthe Elder answers him "yes," he is about as much astonished as we wereyesterday when these magazines ex-ploded. The fact of it is, as I said before, the world do not believe in God or in revelation, and they mar-vel very greatly to find any man whohas really got independence of mindenough to stand up and say—"Ibelieve that Joseph Smith was a Prophet of God, and I believe in therevelations that were given throughhim; I believe in the literal fulfill-ment of prophecy, as written in theBible." To hear men say this astonishes the whole Christian world,and it astonishes the Latter-day Saints to see the amount of darknessand infidelity that are abroad in theearth. Hence, as Latter-day Saints, I think it requires on our part an in-crease of faithfulness in the practiceof our religion, and in the variousrevelations of God contained in theBible, Book of Mormon, and Book ofDoctrine and Covenants.We see before our eyes, year afteryear, the signs of heaven and of earth, and the fulfillment of prophecy, but how much are we as a peopleincreasing in faith in God? Do weincrease in that respect in proportionto the increase of infidelity in theworld? Perhaps I am not a judge,but it appears to me that we do not comprehend. The work in which we are engaged, and the Bible, Book of Mormon, and the Book of Doctrine and Covenants, are just as true to-day as they were twenty, thirty, or forty years ago, when we shoulderedour knapsacks and valises, and tra-veled on foot from city to city, Stateto State, and from country to coun-try, to preach the word of God with-out money and without price, trust-ing in the living God to sustain anduphold us in our missions. I say that this work is just as true now asthen, and so is the saying which I quoted—"Who am I, saith the Lord,that I command and am not obeyed? Who am I, saith the Lord, that I promise and do not fulfill?" I be-lieve that the Lord will fulfill whathe says; I believe that he will fulfill his promises unto the Latter-day Saints and unto the world, untoZion and Babylon; and if he does,there is something at the door, some-thing for us, as Latter-day Saints, todo. I believe the Lord has held every man responsible, from the dayof our great progenitor, father Adam, into whose hands the Holy Priest-hood and the keys of the kingdom ofGod have been committed; and I believe that every man, every set of men, and every people, will be heldresponsible, in time and eternity, for the use they have made of the gifts,blessings, and promises which have been given unto them. The amountof it is, that if any people undertaketo keep a celestial law, it is their pri-vilege to enjoy the spirit and power of that law; it is also the privilege of any man or set of men, who ever received the Gospel, to enjoy the blessings of that Gospel, no matterwhat age of the world they may havelived in. Every person who has everrepented of his sins, and has beenbaptized for their remission, after theorder of God, and after the similitude of Jesus Christ, who was buried inwater in the likeness of his death, and came forth in the likeness of his

 keys of the kingdom, and of the dispensation of the fulness of times.And again, the voice of God in the chamber of old father Whitmer, in Fayette, Seneca county, and at sundry times, and in divers places through the travels and tribulationsof this Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  And the voice of Michael, the arch-angel; the voice of Gabriel, and of Raphael, and of divers angels, from Michael or Adam, down to the present time, all declaring their dispen-sation, their rights, their keys, their honors, their majesty and glory, and the power of theirPriesthood; giving line upon line, precept upon precept; here a little, and there a little—giving us consolation by holding forth that which is to come, confirming our hope.Resuming, President Woodruff said:Thus you have before you the subjectwhich is resting upon us, and which we wish to present to the Latter-day Saints.Let me say that age has very little to do with revelation. In the early age ofthe world, old father Adam, three yearsprevious to his death—he being nearly one thousand years of age—called to-gether his posterity in the valley of Adam-ondi-Ahman, and he stood upon his feet for hours, clothed with the power of God and the revelations of heaven, and blessed his posterity, someseven of whom,each representing a generation, were High Priests. Amongthem were Enoch and Methusaleh, both great men of their day and generation. [##Doctrine and Covenants 107:53##]He prophesied upon them what shouldtranspire with their posterity unto the end of time. His old age did not have any effect whatever upon the revela-tions of God to him. Joseph Smith,when fourteen years of age, whilecalling upon God in the wilderness, hadthe heavens opened unto him. Both the Father and the Son presented them-selves unto him in the clouds of heaven, and the Father said, "This is my belovedSon; hear him." [##Joseph Smith-History 1:17##] The age of man is very short indeed in this day to what it wasin ancient days. Men anciently lived to a very great age. When four or five hundred years old they took wives,begat children, and raised up posterity.Today our age is limited to somethinglike three score years and ten.I wish to say to the Latter-day Saintsthat we live in a very important gen-eration. We are blessed with powerand authority, holding the Holy Priest-hood by the commandment of God, to stand upon the earth and redeem both the living and the dead. If we did not do it, we should be damned and cut off from the earth, and the God of Israel would raise up a people who would do it. The Lord would not permit me to occupy this position one day of my life, unless I was susceptible to the HolySpirit and to the revelations of God. It is too late in the day for this Church to stand without revelation. Not only thePresident of the Church should possessthis gift and give it unto the people, but his counselors and the Apostles and all men that bear the Holy Priesthood, if they magnify their calling, should pos-sess that gift for themselves and to assist them in their duties, although they may not be called to give revelations to lead and direct the Church. The spirit of revelation belongs to the Priesthood.But to come to the subject before us.Perhaps it may be said by the inquiring or the objecting mind, What have you to say about redeeming the dead, or about baptism for the dead, or the work of the Temples of our God, that is not already revealed? I will say this: Whenthe Prophet joseph had this revelation from heaven, what did he do?  Thereare witnesses here of what he did. He never stopped till he got the fulness of the word of God to him concerning the baptism for the dead. But before doing so he went into the Mississippi river,and so did I, as well as others, and we each baptized a hundred for the dead, without a man to record a single act that we performed. Why did we do it? Because of the feeling of joy that we had, to think that we in the flesh could stand and redeem our dead. We did not wait to know what the result of thiswould be, or what the whole of it should be. Finally the Lord told theProphet: "When any of you are bap-tized for your dead, let there be a recorder, and let him be eye witness of your baptisms; let him hear with hisears, that he may testify of a truth, saith the Lord; that in all your record-ings it may be recorded in heaven; whatsoever you bind on earth may bebound in heaven; whatsoever you looseon earth, may be loosed in heaven." [##Doctrine and Covenants 127:6-7##]That was the beginning of this work.Joseph Smith, instead of living to be nearly a thousand years of age as Adam did, lived to be about thirty-eight years of age. He brought forth the record of the stick of Joseph in the hands of Ephraim—the history of the ancient inhabitants of this continent. [##Ezekiel 37:16-20##] By the power of God he translated that, and ithas been published in many languages. Besides this, he organized the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints upon the foundation of apostles and proph-ets, Christ Jesus being the chief cornerstone. Men were ordained to the Priest-hood and sent forth, from the variousoccupations of life, to carry this Gospelto the world. God informed Joseph Smith that he was called to prune thevineyard once more for the last timebefore the coming of the Son of Man.Since that, thousands of Elders ofIsrael have been sent into the world to preach the Gospel. Joseph Smith did all this during the fifteen years he held the Priesthood. Let any man read the revelations in the Book of Doctrine and Covenants, which were given through him during the little time he spent here in the flesh. It is one of the greatest records that any man ever gave to the human family. Not only this, but he organized the endowments and did a great, deal of other work. Who could expect him, during the short time he lived in the flesh, to do more than he did? I received my endowments from under his hands. He brought forth all these ordinances that have been given unto the Latter-day Saints. In fact, it is a marvel and a wonder that he per-formed as much as he did.I want to say, as the President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, that we should now go on and progress. We have not got through revelation. We have not got through the work of God. But at this period we want to go on and fulfill this com-mandment of God given through Malachi—that the Lord should send Elijah the prophet, "and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse." [##Malachi 4:5-6##] Ye sons of men, I say unto you, in the name of Israel's God, those very principles that God has re-vealed are what have stayed the judg-ments of the Almighty on the earth. Were it not for these principles, you and I would not be here today. We havehad prophets and apostles. Presi-dent Young, who followed President Joseph Smith, led us here. He organ-ized these Temples and carried out the purposes of his calling and office. He laid the foundation of this great Temple on this block, as well as others in the mountains of Israel. What for? That we might carry out these principles of redemption for the dead. He accom-plished all that God required at his hands. But he did not receive all the revelations that belong to this work; neither did President Taylor, nor has Wilford Woodruff. There will be no end to this work until it is perfected.I want to lay before you what there is for us to do at the present time; and in doing this I desire particularly the at-tention of President Lorenzo Snow, of the Salt Lake Temple; President M. W. Merrill, of the Logan Temple; President J. D. T. McAllister, of the Manti Temple, and President D. H. Cannon, of the St. George Temple, and those associated with them. You have acted up to all the light and knowledge that you have had; but you have now something more to do than what you have done. We have not fully carried out those princi-ples in fulfillment of the revelations of God to us, in sealing the hearts of the fathers to the children and the children to the fathers. I have not felt satisfied, neither did President Taylor, neither hasany man since the Prophet Joseph who has attended to the ordinance of adop-tion in the temples of our God. We have felt that there was more to be re-vealed upon this subject than we had received. Revelations were given to us in the St. George Temple, which Presi-dent Young presented to the Church of God. Changes were made there, and we still have more changes to make, in order to satisfy our Heavenly Father, satisfy our dead and ourselves. I will tell you what some of them are. I have prayed over this matter, and my breth-ren have. We have felt as President Taylor said, that we have got to havemore revelation concerning sealing under the law of adoption. Well, what are these changes? One of them is the principle of adoption. In the com-mencement of adopting men and women in the Temple at Nauvoo, agreat many persons were adopted to different men who were not of the lineage of their fathers, and there was a spirit manifested by some in that work there that was not of God. Men would go out and electioneer and labor with all their power to get men adopted to them. One instance I will name here: A man went around Nauvoo asking every man he could, saying, "You come and be adopted to me, and I shall stand at the head of the Kingdom, and you will be there with me." Now, what is the truth about this? Those who were adopted to that man, if they go with him, will have to go where he is. He was a participator in that horrible scene—the Mountain Meadow massacre. Men have tried to lay that to President Young. I was with President Young when the massacre was first reported to him. President Young was perfectly horrified at the recital of it, and wept over it. He asked: "Was there any white man had anything to do withthat?" The reply was, No; and by the representations then made to him he was misinformed concerning the whole transaction. I will say here, and call heaven and earth to witness, that Presi-dent Young, during his whole life, never was the author of the shedding of the

 188 JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.resurrection, has a right to the HolyGhost; it is promised, and it belongs to him; it is the right of all personsto enjoy this, and if they receive theHoly Ghost and its gifts, they haveinspiration, light, and truth; theyhave eyes to see, ears to hear, and hearts to understand, and they should be in a position before the Lord thatthey can comprehend his work far more perfectly than the world, for they have not obeyed the Gospel of Christ, and they have no right to, or claim upon, the gifts of that Gospel. But all who, in any age of the world, obey the Gospel, have a right to the Comforter, and to inspiration and revelation, they belong to them, andthe Lord never had a people on the face of the earth who did not have aright to these gifts, and it was theirprivilege and duty to enjoy them.This is the difference between those who keep celestial law, the law of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and those who do not. But, as I have re-marked, all in every age of the worldwho have received a dispensation ofthe Gospel, are responsible before theLord for their acts, and for the man-ner in which they have used theirblessings and privileges. The Pro-phets and Apostles in every age have been held responsible for the manner in which they made use of the Gospel of Christ when committed unto them; and that is the way it is with us to-day. One thing is evident to every-body who reflects at all upon the things of the kingdom of God—when-ever the Lord chooses a people out of the world, they are hated by theworld, and are unpopular in the world. This has been the case inevery age. It was so in the days of Jesus Christ. He came to his ownfather's house—the Jews; he was of the lineage of Abraham, and when hecame to his own brethren he was un-popular, he was rejected and opposed. [##Matthew 1:1##]They did not like him nor his course. They were looking for Shiloh to come, but not as a babe born in a stable and cradled in a manger, and traveling on from that to the cross and the grave in poverty and afflic-tion, without military authority, andwithout power to govern and control, and to deliver and uphold the Jews as a nation. Christ came as the babeof Bethlehem, the lowest almost of the human family, and remained so up to the day of his death. A poorer man never lived, that I know of, in Judea and Jerusalem, than Jesus Christ. Who were his followers? They were not the great, rich, learned, noble, High Priests, or leading men of Judea; many of them were illi-terate fishermen, poor men, weak things of the world; they were theclass that Jesus chose for his disciples, and into their hands he gave the keys of the kingdom of God; hegave them the Apostleship, the powerto bind and to seal both on earth and in heaven. Their deeds and labors reached not only through this world,but they reached into the eternalworlds, and will affect the inhabitants of Judea and Jerusalem from that day, I may say, into eternity. Those disciples of Christ received the HolyPriesthood, the Gospel of Christ, and the keys of the kingdom of God, and Jesus held them responsible to theday of their death for the coursethey pursued. However much theywere despised by the world, they wereheld responsible for bearing a true and faithful testimony to Jew andGentile, of Jesus Christ being the true Shepherd and the Savior of the world.And so I will say about the Latter-day Saints and the work they are engaged in. Ezekiel says that in thelast days the stick of Joseph in thehands of Ephraim should be placedwith the stick of Judah, before the [##Ezekiel 37:15-20##] 
 go forth and bear a true and faithful testimonyto the nations of the earth and the isles of the sea, and have preached unto them the gospel ofChrist, and what has been the consequence?—The words of the Lord have been fulfilled to the very letter, for wherever this Gospel has beenpreached there have been hypocrites, the wickedand ungodly, and there also have been the honestand the meek of the earth, and whoever have re-ceived this testimony, been baptized for the re-mission of sins, received the laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost—have had their minds enlightened, and they have looked forward with an eye of faith to see the fulfilment of what God has promised.Have we as a Church been disappointed in anything? No, we have not, but the Lord has fulfilled his promises in relation to the things of his kingdom.The Lord has chosen men like Joseph and Hy-rum, the Smith family, and the Twelve Apostles,and they have been humble men in this churchand kingdom, and almost all the officers have been called from the laboring class, from the plow,from the hammer and the anvil, and from nearly every occupation, and their words have pierced the honest in heart, for they have had all the power, blessings and knowledge which the Lordhas given unto them, and they have given the honor and glory to God. I will venture to saythere is no people upon the earth who have beenpicked up as we have been, for we have beengathered from all religions and sects.The Elders have gone forth teaching and bap-tizing the people; they have laid their hands upon the sick and healed them, cast out devils, and had power to do all those things which the Lord has promised unto believers. Wherever the peoplehave received the truth the signs have followed—the lame have been made to walk, the deaf to hear, the blind to see; fevers have been rebukedand the elements have been subject to the Eldersof Israel. Where is there a man who has gone out to preach the gospel who has not been con-strained by the Spirit to warn the people, as mes-sengers of salvation, of the judgments that arecoming upon the earth?We have been called upon to warn all who came in our way, including kings, rulers, therich, and learned, as well as the poor and humble.It is true that the Lord might have enlightenedthe minds of the rulers, the rich and learned andchosen them to have performed his work in theestablishment of his Church upon the earth, buthe never has seen fit to work through that chan-nel, but he has ever chosen the poor and humbleas his messengers upon the earth.There is another thing which I desire to allude to, and that is the very excellent discourse wehave heard to-day, and the testimony of the ser-vants of God in relation to our present position. The opposition that we have had and the perse-cutions we have passed through have been allud-ed to by br. Taylor, and all those matters are infulfilment of what the angel told br. Joseph, and as long as Satan rules in the world this spirit ofmobocracy will manifest itself, even until thescenery shall be wound up, and until he whoholds the keys of the bottomless pit shall bind himwith a chain, cast him into the pit and shut him up, and put a seal upon him.We expect this. It is what we are looking for,and yet we above all people have reason to re-joice; we have reason to rejoice in him who stands at the helm, and who has nourished andsustained this kingdom from the beginning. TheGod of heaven has never forsaken this work, but he has ever backed up his servants and opened their way before them.How the soul of the Prophet rejoiced when hebeheld the work of God spreading abroad in theearth, the truth received by the children of men, and the promises of God verified to the letter, inthe gathering of the Saints and a way preparedfor the establishment of Zion upon the earth.We have had the holy Priesthood conferred upon us, and the power of God has surrounded us, so that we have been preserved thus far fromthe hands of our enemies in the midst of the many circumstances in which we have been placed. Those things should increase our faith before the Lord and give us confidence in his promises, andit should inspire our hearts to diligence in thefulfilment of every duty required of us.The Lord says, in the revelations contained inthe Book of Doctrine and Covenants that this gospel shall be preached in all the world, and he commands his servants to call upon all nations to repent and obey the voice of God, to receive the gospel and the words of eternal life. He says:'Lift up your voices and spare not. Call uponthe nations to repent, both old and young, bothbond and free; saying,—Prepare yourselves forthe great day of the Lord: for if I, who am aman, do lift up my voice and call upon you torepent, and ye hate me, what will ye say whenthe day cometh when the thunders shall uttertheir voices from the ends of the earth, speakingto the ears of all that live, saying: Repent andprepare for the great day of the Lord! yea, andagain, when the lightnings shall streak forth fromthe east unto the west, and shall utter forth theirvoices unto all that live, and make the ears of alltingle, that hear, saying these words: Repent ye, for the great day of the Lord is come!6 And again, the Lord shall utter his voice out of heaven, saying: Hearken, O ye nations of the earth, and hear the word of that God who madeyou. O, ye nations of the earth, how oftenwould I have gathered you together as a hengathereth her chickens under her wings, but yewould not! How oft have I called you by the mouth of my servants, and by the ministering of angels, and by mine own voice, and by the voiceof thunderings, and by the voice of lightnings,and by the voice of tempests, and by the voice of earthquakes and great hailstorms, and by thevoice of famines and pestilences of every kind, and by the great sound of a trump, and by the voice of judgment, and by the voice of mercy all the day long, and by the voice of glory and honor,and the riches of eternal life, and would have saved you with an everlasting salvation, but yewould not! Behold the day has come, when thecup of the wrath of mine indignation is full.7 Behold, verily I say unto you, that these arethe words of the Lord your God: wherefore, la-bor ye, labor ye in my vineyard for the last time:for the last time call upon the inhabitants of the earth, for in my own due time will I come uponthe earth in judgment; and my people shall be re-deemed and shall reign with me on earth; for thegreat millennial, of which I have spoken by the mouthof my servants, shall come; for satan shall bebound; and when he is loosed again, he shall only reign for a little season, and then cometh the end of the earth; and he that liveth in righteous-ness, shall be changed in the twinkling of an eye;and the earth shall pass away so as by fire; andthe wicked shall go away into unquenchable fire; and their end no man knoweth on earth, nor evershall know, until they come before me in judg-ment'—[Doc. and Covs, sec. xiv, page 177.I look upon these things; I reflect upon ourgovernment in the manner which has been re-ferred to to-day; I look at the liberal laws and Constitution that exist in our land upon which our Government is founded, and yet in the midstof all this, we have not had the privilege of en-joying our rights, or worshipping God or enjoyingour religion, without persecution and oppression. The Lord has frequently given us revelations uponthese things, and he has spoken concerning our government and Constitution, and he has said 'yeare justified in maintaining the Constitution andlaws of the land, for they make you free and thegospel maketh you free, and you shall seek tosustain good and wise men for rulers, and what-soever is more or less than this cometh of evil.'Do you blame the Latter Day Saints? Can theLord, can angels, or can anybody blame the Lat-ter Day Saints for rejecting such cursed, corruptscoundrels as we have had here? The laws of heaven command us not to uphold and sustainmen except they are good men, who will sustainthe Constitution of our country, and we are ful-filling the revelations in this respect as in manyothers, and we are carrying out the requirements of the Constitution of the United States.We have fulfilled the law of God, and we havealways been willing to receive and respect allgood and wise men in carrying out the laws andConstitution of our country.We have plead with the government, we haveplead with the President and we have plead withthe Senate of the United States to send us good men; br. Taylor has told us they will not do it,and why? Because they are not good themselves;they are not virtuous, they are not holy, and they will not acknowledge the hand of God at all, butseek to overthrow the blessings and spirit of that rich legacy bequeathed to us through the blood of our fathers—the Constitution. Here is where I consider that our nation, and the whole people of the United States, are under condemnation; it is because they have a constitution and laws ofgovernment which the people control, for theyelect their own officers, for all citizens have the right to vote for their governors, presidents andofficers in general, and hence they come under condemnation. [Blessed the sacramental cup.]The whole people have a vote in the selectionof their officers and if they appoint wicked men or their governors and for their rulers, and then those rulers go to work and rule unrighteously, tyrannize over the poor and humble, and sacrificehuman life to satisfy their wicked ambition, at whose hands will the Lord require the blood of the innocent? He will require it of those who elected the officers, for the responsibility does notrest alone upon the presidents, or governors, or judges, but it rests in a great measure with thepeople who placed them in power, when a nationbecomes corrupt and appoint corrupt and wickedrulers, and sustains them in their wickedness.When Joseph and Hyrum Smith were mur-dered the greater part of the people rejoiced in it, and would remark that it was a pity the Smithshad died in the way they had, but it was a goodthing they were out of the way. Governor Fordsaid, when speaking to the brethren in Nauvoo, that almost every man he talked with would sayit was a pity the Smiths should die under the pledged protection of the Governor of the State,but yet they were glad they were dead. Will notGod require an atonement at the hands of such men?Inasmuch as we have trusted in the Lord, andhave found him true to his word, why should wenot trust him now? If the harvest was ripetwenty or thirty years ago surely it is ripe now,for the Elders of Israel have gone forth to the nations, and the people have rejected their testi-mony.The more I look at the words which the Lordhas spoken concerning our enemies, and especiallythose of this nation, the more I become satisfied that they will not escape the judgments of the Al-mighty any more than the Nephites of old did, or any of the other nations who have rejected themessage sent unto them by the God of Heaven.— This nation are ripe in iniquity, and the destroy-ing angels are at their doors; and I am as surethat the scourges will follow as I am that the servants of God have borne a true and faithful testimony unto them. I know what the con-sequence will be of the world rejecting the truth, for I have the testimony of Jesus and the Spirit of God within me, and therefore I say let us look well to our ways, remember our covenants, our duties and our prayers and I do hope and pray that the Elders in Great Salt Lake City, will notin the midst of their recreations neglect their prayers on their duties before the Lord, nor per-mit any thing to stand between them and thebuilding up the kingdom of God.Mormonism is just as good as it was a year ago.The gospel of Jesus Christ is as good as it was ayear ago, or as it was in Kirtland or Nauvoo, andit is our privilege to continue to increase in bless-ings, glory, power and virtue from this time hence-forth and for ever, and therefore I say, brethren and sisters, let us lay these things to heart, and let us look at them as they exist before us. Let us read the revelations of God and give heed tothe teachings of the living Oracles and have faithin their promises, that we may thereby have the Spirit of God to enlighten us and to guide us through this probation.The Presidency of this Church are good men,they are filled with the Spirit of the Lord con-tinually, with the spirit of teaching, of counsel, which if we follow will lead us on to eternal life,therefore we are blest, and saved when we obeytheir teaching.We have our leading men, and our Governor, all of whom have proceeded out of the midst ofus; our judges, our wise men, and our rulers, arethose that have come out of the house of Israel,and this is a blessing and a privilege that Israelhave not enjoyed for many generations. We seethat the Elders have gone forth and laboured for the upbuilding of the Kingdom of God, and forcarrying out the purposes of our heavenly Father and for the accomplishment of the great work of the latter days.We have the greatest reason to be thankful ofany people upon the earth, and we should realizethat as we have been preserved heretofore, so we shall be hereafter, and though the United States, and though all Europe and hell may make warupon us yet if we listen to the counsel that has been given, the blow will be warded off, and what-ever we may be called to pass through will befor our salvation, exaltation and glory.I pray the Lord my heavenly Father to grantus his Spirit that we may prize our blessings, keep our covenants, and continually have his favor, andcontinue humble and faithful, and that he willpour out those judgments upon the wicked, proud and the rebellious which they desire to in-flict upon the people of God, which may the Lord grant for Christ's sake:—Amen.

 blood of any of the human family; andwhen the books are opened in the dayof judgment these things will be provento heaven and earth. Perhaps I had notought to enter into these things, but itcame to me. Men are in danger some-times in being adopted to others, untilthey know who they are and what theywill be. Now, what are the feelings ofIsrael? They have felt that they wantedto be adopted to somebody. PresidentYoung was not satisfied in his mind withregard to the extent of this matter;President Taylor was not. When I wentbefore the Lord to know who I shouldbe adopted to (we were then beingadopted to prophets and apostles,) theSpirit of God said to me, "Have you nota father, who begot you?" "Yes, I have." "Then why not honor him? Why notbe adopted to him?" "Yes," says I,"that is right." I was adopted to my father, and should have had my fathersealed to his father, and so on back; andthe duty that I want every man whopresides over a Temple to see performedfrom this day henceforth and forever,unless the Lord Almighty commandsotherwise, is, let every man be adoptedto his father. When a man receives theendowments, adopt him to his father;not to Wilford Woodruff, nor to anyother man outside the lineage of hisfathers. That is the will of God to thispeople. I want all men who presideover these temples in these mountainsof Israel to bear this in mind. Whatbusiness have I to take away the rightsof the lineage of any man? What righthas any man to do this? No; I say letevery man be adopted to his father; andthen you will do exactly what God saidwhen he declared He would send Elijahthe prophet in the last days. [##Malachi 4:5##] Elijah theprophet appeared unto Joseph Smithand told him that the day had comewhen this principle must be carried out. [##Doctrine and Covenants 110:13-16##]Joseph Smith did not live long enoughto enter any further upon these things.His sould was wound up with this workbefore he was martyred for the word ofGod and testimony of Jesus Christ. Hetold us that there must be a weldinglink of all dispensations and of the workof God from one generation to another.This was upon his mind more than mostany other subject that was given to him.In my prayers the Lord revealed to me,that it was my duty to say to all Israel to carry this principle out, and in fulfill-ment of that revelation I lay it before this people. I say to all men who arelaboring in these temples, carry out thisprinciple, and then we will make onestep in advance of what we have hadbefore. Myself and counselors con-versed upon this and were agreed uponit, afterwards we laid it before allthe Apostles who were here (two wereabsent—Brothers Thatcher and Lund, thelatter being in England,) and the Lordrevealed to every one of these men—and they would bear testimony to it if they were to speak—that that was theword of the Lord to them. I never metwith anything in my life in this Churchthat there was more unity upon thanthere was upon that principle. Theyall feel right about it, and that it is our duty. That is one principle that shouldbe carried out from this time henceforth."But," says one, "suppose we comealong to a man who perhaps is a mur-derer." Well, if he is a murderer, drophim out and connect with the next manbeyond him. But the Spirit of God willbe with us in this matter. We want theLatter day Saints from this time to tracetheir genealogies as far as they can, andto be sealed to their fathers and mothers.Have children sealed to their parents,and run this chain through as far as youcan get it. When you get to the end,let the last man be adopted to JosephSmith, who stands at the head of the dispensation. This is the will of theLord to this people, and I think whenyou come to reflect upon it you will findit to be true.Another principle connected with thissubject I want to talk about. A manhas married a woman, and they have a family of children. The man lays downin death without ever hearing the Gos-pel. His wife afterwards hears theGospel and embraces it. She comes tothe temple and she wants to be sealedto her husband, who was a good man.The feeling has been to deny this andto say, "No, he was not in the Church,and you cannot be sealed to your hus-band." Many of a woman's heart hasached because of this, and as a servantof God I have broken that chain a goodwhile ago. I have laid before every womanthis principle and let her have her choice.Why deprive a woman of being sealed to her husband because he never heardthe Gospel? What do any of us knowwith regard to him? Will he not hearthe Gospel and embrace it in the spiritworld? Look at Joseph Smith. Notone of Joseph Smith's fathers orbrothers or sisters were in the convenantwhen he received the keys of the king-dom of God and translated the Book of Mormon. They afterwards received it.Every brother and sister that he had,and his father and his father's brothers,except Uncle Jesse Smith, embracedthe Gospel. Now, suppose that any ofthese had died before they had the op-portunity of entering into the covenantwith the Lord through the Gospel, ashis brother Alvin did; they would havebeen in the same position as Alvin,concerning whom the Lord,when Josephsaw him in the celestial kingdom, said:All who have died without a knowledge ofthis Gospel, who would have received it if theyhad been permitted to tarry, shall be heirs of thecelestial kingdom of God; also all that shall die henceforth without a knowledge of it, whowould have received it with all their hearts,shall be heirs of that kingdom, for I, the Lord,will judge all men according to their works, ac-cording to the desire of their hearts.So it will be with your fathers. Therewill be very few, if any, who will notaccept the Gospel, Jesus, while His body lay in the tomb,went and preachedto the spirits in prison, who were des-troyed in the days of Noah. Afterso long an imprisonment, in torment,they doubtless gladly embraced theGospel, and if so they will be saved inthe kingdom of God. The fathers of thispeople will embrace the Gospel. It ismy duty to honor my father who begotme in the flesh. It is your duty to dothe same. When you do this, the Spiritof God will be with you. And we shallcontinue this work, the Lord addinglight to that which we have already re-ceived. I have had friends adopted tome. We all have, more or less. But Ihave had peculiar feelings about it, espe-cially lately. There are men in this con-gregation who wish to be adopted tome. I say to them today, if they can hear me, Go and be adopted to yourfathers, and save your fathers, andstand at the head of your father's house,as saviors upon Mount Zion, and Godwill bless you in this. This is what Iwant to say, and what I want carriedout in our temples.The Almighty is with this people.  We shall have all the revelations thatwe will need, if we will do our duty andobey the commandments of God. Whenany of us get so that we cannot receivethese revelations, the Lord will take usout of the way and put someone in ourplaces who can. I am here today, onborrowed time, I may say. I wouldhave been in the spirit world today,mingling with the spirits in the presenceof God, had it not been for the cry ofthis people for my life when I lay at thegates of death a year ago. I have beenpreserved by the power of God. Howlong I shall live I do not know. It doesnot make any difference to me. Butwhile I do live I want to do my duty,I want the Latter-day Saints to do theirduty. Here is the Holy Priesthood inthese mountains. Their responsibilityis great and mighty. The eyes of Godand all the holy prophets are watchingover us. This is the great dispensationthat has been spoken of ever since theworld began. We are gathered to-gether in these mountains of Israel bythe power and commandment of God.We are doing the work of God. This isnot our home, as far as mortality is con-cerned. We shall soon pass away. Butwhile here let us fill our mission. Iwant to say to Brother L. Snow,Brother M. W. Merrill, Brother J. D. T.McAllister and Brother D. H. Cannon,and all associated with you, carry thesethings before the Lord and see foryourselves. If you are not satisfiedwith this order of things, go and ask theLord about it, and the Holy Ghost willreveal to you the truth of these princi-ples.This is all I ought to say at thistime perhaps upon this subject.I am glad to meet with you. I havehad a great anxiety over this matter.I have had a great desire that I mightlive to deliver these principles to theLatter-day Saints, for they are true.They are one step forward in the workof the ministry and in the work of theendowments in these temples of ourGod. When you get to the last man inthe lineage, as I said before, we willadopt that man to the Prophet Joseph, and then the Prophet Joseph will takecare of himself with regard to where hegoes. A man may say, "I am anApostle, or I am a High Priest, or I aman Elder in Israel, and if I am adoptedto my father, will it take any honor fromme?" I would say not. If Joseph Smithwas sealed to his father, with whom manyof you were acquainted, what effect willthat have upon his exaltation and glory?None at all. Joseph Smith will hold thekeys of this dispensation to the endlessages of eternity. It is the greatest dis-pensation God ever gave to man, and hewas ordained before the world was tostand in the flesh and organize thiswork. He was martyred for the wordof God and testimony of Jesus, and whenhe comes in the clouds of heaven he willwear a martyr's crown. Those of youwho stand here—I do not care whetheryou are Apostles or what you are—byhonoring your fathers you will not takeany honor from your heads; youwill hold the keys of the salvation ofyour father's house, as Joseph Smithdoes. You will lose nothing by honor-ing your fathers and redeeming yourdead. It is a glorious work. When Ireturned from England in 1841 and heard Joseph Smith give this revelation,

 that we had power to redeem our dead,one of the first things I thought was, "Ihave a mother in the spirit world."  Myfather was in the flesh. I baptized andordained him and brought him up toZion, where he is buried. But I neversaw my mother to know her. She diedwhen I was an infant. I had power toseal my mother to my father. Was notthat a satisfaction? It was to me. Ihave gone to work with the assistanceof my friends and redeemed my father'sand my mother's house. When I wentto inquire of the Lord how I could re-deem my dead, while I was in St.George, not having any of my familythere, the Lord told me to call upon theSaints in St. George and let themofficiate for me in that temple, and itshould be acceptable unto Him.Brother McAllister and the brethren andsisters there have assisted me in thiswork, and I felt to bless them withevery feeling of my heart. This is arevelation to us. We can help oneanother in these matters, if we have notrelatives sufficient to carry this on, andit will be acceptable unto the Lord.Brethren and sisters, lay these things toheart. Let us go on with our records,fill them up righteously before the Lord,and carry out this principle, and theblessings of God will attend us, andthose who redeemed will bless us indays to come. I pray God that as apeople our eyes may be opened to see,our ears to hear, and our heartsto understand the great and mightywork that rests upon our shoulders, andthat the God of heaven requires at our hands. Great and glorious are theseprinciples which God has revealed to usconcerning the redemption of our dead.I tell you when the prophets andapostles go to preach to those who areshut up in prison, and who have notreceived the Gospel, thousands of themwill there embrace the Gospel. Theyknow more in that world than they dohere. I pray God that as a people wemay have power to magnify our call-ings in this great and mighty dispensa-tion while we dwell in the flesh, thatwhen our work is done we may besatisfied with this life and this work.This is my prayer and the desire of myheart, in the name of Jesus Christ.Amen. 
 INFIDELITY OF THE CHRISTIAN WORLD, ETC. 189eyes of the nations in the hands ofthe Lord, for a special purpose—to gather the house of Israel in the lat-ter days. These two records werealso to be made use of in order to preach the fullness of the everlasting Gospel to both Jew and Gentile; andthey will stand in judgment againstthe generation living on the earthwhen they come forth; and from the day that Moroni gave that record intothe hands of Joseph Smith, the Lord held him responsible for the usewhich he made of it; and when hegave him the Priesthood under thehands of John the Baptist, and the Apostleship under the hands of Peter, James and John, the Lord Almightyheld him responsible unto the day that he sealed his testimony with hisblood, for the course that he pursued with these things. [##Joseph Smith-History 1:59##] [##Joseph Smith-History 1:68-72##] [##Doctrine and Covenants 128:20##] And he bore histestimony, left it on record, and sealedit with his blood, and laid down hislife, and that testimony is in force to-day upon all the world, and will re-main so unto the end of time. And when I say this of Joseph Smith Isay it of every other man. President Young has led this Church for many years, and the Lord has held himresponsible, and will hold him sounto the day of his death, for thecourse pursued by him while con-ducting the affairs of his Church and kingdom, and also for the use he makes of the holy Priesthood andthe keys of the kingdom. So alsowith his Counselors, the TwelveApostles, and every one of us; weshall all be held accountable to the day of our death, and we shall haveto give an account before the God ofheaven when we go into the spiritworld and meet him there; for the use of this Priesthood, and the keys of the kingdom, which have beenestablished on the earth for the last time, have been committed into the hands of this people, and God will hold the whole of us responsible for the use we make of the blessings, privileges and powers which we enjoy in connection therewith. The eyesof God and his angels, and of every man who dwells in the celestial world are watching us, and the course we pursue.We are gathered together here as a people; we have been in thesemountains a good while, and for a good many years we have been or-ganized as a Church and kingdom,in this last age, in this dispensa-tion of the fullness of times; andnow the question with me is—Are we living up to our privileges? Are we performing the work required atour hands? Can we, as a people,claim the blessings of the Gospel of Christ, the blessings of the celestial law and of the celestial kingdom of God? Can we claim these things at the hands of our heavenly Father unless we keep his commandments? This is a question that we want to take home to ourselves. If we arenot keeping the commands of the Lord can we claim his blessings? We can not; and this is matterfor reflection for the Latter-daySaints.It may be asked—What are thecommandments of the Lord? Manyof them are contained in these re-cords, the Bible, Book of Mormonand Book of Doctrine and Cove-nants; and we have the living ora-cles with us, and have had from thecommencement. The Lord will never leave his kingdom without a lawgiver, leader, president, or some power to direct the affairs of his Church onthe earth, for the reason that it isthe dispensation of the fullness of times, in which God has set up a kingdom which is to be an everlasting kingdom, and to whose dominion there will be no end; that kingdomwill not be given into the hands of

Thursday, May 14, 1896. Price One Penny.DISCOURSE BY PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF.THE following discourse was delivered by President Wilford Woodruff atthe General Conference of the Church, in the Tabernacle, Salt Lake City, April 5, 1896:The highest calling the Lord ever called any human being to, in any age of the world, has been to receive the Holy Priesthood, with its keys and powers, and to be called to go forth to the inhabitants of the earth and teach them the principles of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and to qualify and prepare them for a part in the first resurrection and to go back into the presence of God, their Creator, to dwell in glory worlds without end. The Lord bestowed that blessing, that Priesthood and that power in the beginning of creation. Father Adam was called of God and ordained to the fullness of the Melchisedek Priesthood--ordained to the highest officeand gift of God to man on the earth. Adam bestowed that blessing upon seven of his sons--Seth, Enos, Jared, Canaan, Mahalaleel, Enoch and Methuselah. They were all ordained High Priests by their father Adam, and possessed the privilege and the right to understand the Gospel of Jesus Christ and to give it to the human family, so that they might qualify and prepare themselves for eternal life. [##Doctrine and Covenants 107:53##] In tracing the history of the dealings of God with men from that day to this, we find the Lord has in various dispensations and times given unto the sons of men that blessing. Israel had it in the beginning, from Abraham, Isaac and Jacob down, and until Moses, who traveled with the children of Israel forty years in the wilderness. They had the gifts and graces of that Priesthood bestowed upon them, and they had the privilege of magnifying their callings and preparing themselves for eternal life. But Israel would not accept the Melchisedek Priesthood, and therefore it was taken from them, and the Lesser Priesthood was conferred upon them while they traveled [##Doctrine and Covenants 84:23-26##]

 190 JOURNAL OF DISCOURSES.any other people, but it will be given to the Saints of the Most High, andthey will possess it for ever and ever.Now, brethren and sisters, herecomes a question in my mind, thismorning, which I think we oughtto bring home to ourselves, and thatis—Are we, as a people, doing our duty in keeping the law and com-mandments of God, and the cove-nants which we have made? If we are we are justified, and we have aclaim upon the Holy Spirit and upon the blessing and approbation of God. Many things are required at the hands of the Latter-day Saints, and there is not one of uswho has a lease of his life. TheElders of this Church are passing away, and almost every Conferencewe look around and find that some-body has left us; and it will be buta short time before many of us whoare here to-day will have closed ourlabors in the flesh, and we shall havepassed to the other side of the vail, and it is important to us all that weshould do what is required of us. What we find to do to-day we shouldnot put off till to-morrow.The question may arise in someminds—What is required of the Latter-day Saints? I will tell yousome things that are required of us.The Lord requires us to pay ourTithing; and another thing is thatwe go to and build the Temple inthis city; whether we do it or not it is required of us, and if we fail, we, in my view, shall be under con-demnation. I consider that the building of Temples is one of theimportant things required by the Lord of the Latter-day Saints inthe dispensation of the fullness of times, that we may go into thoseTemples and not only redeem theliving but redeem our dead. We have been a good many years here in the valleys of the mountains, and we have not yet got a Temple finished to the name of the Lord. We have one pretty well forward in St. George, and I am very glad of it; but we want one here. We have got the foundation laid; it has been standing a good many years, and I think that we shouldgo to and finish it, and do what we can to redeem our dead. This isamong the things for which I think we shall be held responsible. Very many of us in this Church andkingdom have been gathered, as the Prophet has said, one of a familyand two of a city, and many of our progenitors, now in the spirit world, never saw the face of an Apostle, Prophet, or inspired man, and theyare shut up in prison. Joseph Smith, Heber Kimball, Geoege A. Smith,and thousands of the Elders of Israelmay preach to those spirits, and they may receive the testimonies which the Elders bear; but the Elders will not baptize believers there; there isno baptism in the spirit world anymore than there is any marrying andgiving in marriage. All these thingshave to be done this side of the vail,in the flesh. God is no respecter ofpersons; he will not give privileges to one generation and withhold them from another; and the whole humanfamily, from father Adam down to our day, have got to have the privi-lege, somewhere, of hearing the Gos-pel of Christ; and the generations that have passed and gone withouthearing that Gospel in its fullness, power and glory, will never be held responsible by God for not obeying it, neither will he bring them undercondemnation for rejecting a law they never saw or understood; andif they live up to the light they had they are justified so far, and theyhave to be preached to in the spirit world. But nobody will baptize

It is not necessary for me to spend time in tracing this Priesthood through the six thousand years that have past and gone; but it has been manifest in every age and dispensation when God has had prophets and apostles on the earth. Jesus Christ came into the world in the meridian of time. He was the Great High Priest to Israel. He was the Son of God, the Savior of the world. He chose His Apostles, He organized His Church. He bestowed upon these Apostles all the gifts and graces belonging to the apostleship. In that dispensation it seems that they were called to lay down their lives for the word of God and testimony of Jesus Christ. The Savior himself was put to death. The Apostles were all, with one exception, put to death in their day and time, until finally the Priesthood was taken home to God, and remained there for a length of time. But my views are that whenever the inhabitants of the earth were prepared for the Gospel of Jesus Christ and the power of the Priesthood, it has been bestowed upon them.In the days of the Savior and His Apostles, John the Revelator, while upon the Isle of Patmos, gave an outline of great events which were to transpire in the last dispensation of the fulness of times. Other prophets and apostles, who spoke as they were moved upon by the Holy Ghost, left on the pages of history a record of what the Lord would do in the last dispensation. Among the great events that the Revelator saw was the one described in the 14th chapter of his Revelation, and which is often quoted by our elders, because it is very applicable.And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the ever-lasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people,Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come.If this revelation had not been fulfilled, neither you nor I would be here to-day, this Tabernacle would not be erected, this city would be still part of the Great American Desert, as we found it; but in the fulfillment of the revelations of God, these things have been done and some of us have lived to see them. The angel of God did visit Joseph Smith, the Prophet of God, who was raised up by the power of God as a prophet, seer and revelator, and who organized the Church of Jesus Christ in the earth.From that day until this the work has progressed and the Gospel hasbeen preached. The Holy Ghost has been with the people. The LordAlmighty has set His hand to carry out the great programme--to establishthe Zion of God in the earth and to prepare the people for the coming ofthe Son of Man.These are my views with regard to the calling of men in this dispensa-tion. Gold and silver may pass away; houses and lands may perish; all temporal matters will pass away; but the Priesthood never, salvation never, the kingdom of God never, and prophecy will never fall unfulfilled. We have had all Apostles now for upwards of sixty years. Many have died and gone to the other side of the veil; and those upon whom God bestowed the glory and power of the organization of the Church have sealed their testimony with their blood, as the ancient Apostles did. They have gone

 INFIDELITY OF THE CHRISTIAN WORLD ETC. 191them there, and somebody has gotto administer for them by proxy here in the flesh, that they may be judged according to men in the flesh andhave part in the first resurrection.This, in my view, is the work that is required at the hands of the Lat-ter-day Saints, and when we get through I think we will find this tobe true. And if there is anything I desire to live for on the earth, orthat I have desired, it has been toget a record of the genealogy of myfathers, that I might do somethingfor them before I go hence into thespirit world. Until within a few years past it has seemed as if everyavenue has been closed to obtainingsuch records; but the Lord has movedupon the inhabitants of this nation, and thousands of them are now labor-ing to trace the genealogical descent of the Puritan fathers, those wholanded at Plymouth Rock, and whosedescendants built up New England. Their lineages are coming to light, and we are gradually obtaining ac-cess to them, and by this means weshall be enabled to do somethingtowards the salvation of our dead.These are some of the things uponmy mind that I wished to speak to you about. And now let me ask—Have we a right to our endowments and to the ordinances and blessings of the Church and kingdom of God, unless we fulfill the law of God. It seems to me many times, that thereis a darkness and a lack of faith evenamong the Latter-day Saints, andthat as we grow older we grow colder, and as we advance towards the wind-ing-up scene it seems as though wehave almost lost sight of our calling,of the object of our being gatheredtogether, and the purposes which God requires at our hands. Thereis a good deal for us to do if we build up Zion; and if we do that and sanctify ourselves before the Lord, it has got to be done through obedi-ence to the commandments of the Lord. The Lord has commanded us, and we have got to obey hiscommandments if we receive theblessings of obedience. Our num-bers are not great, and comparedwith the whole of the inhabitants of the earth I do not expect that the number of the Latter-day Saints will ever be very great; yetthe Lord has promised that the little one shall become a thousand,and the small one a strong nation; and out of the house of Israel andthose from among the Gentiles whoobey the Gospel, God will raise up anation, and they will have powerand strength in the earth. Butwhen we compare the Saints in this or any other age with the surround-ing world, their numbers are few.I do not know why it is that so few of the inhabitants of the earth take any interest in their eternal welfare.The whole human family, heathen,pagan, Christian and Jew, know that this is not their home, and that all have got to die, they can not escape the law of death; even if translated,as some were anciently, they have toundergo a change equivalent to death. Then why is it there is so little in-terest throughout the world with regard to a future state and to eternalmatters? The few who show they have an interest in these things, and who have gathered together to thesevalleys of the mountains, have needof faith; we stand in need of prayer,we stand in need of the Holy Ghost,and of the inspiration of the Al-mighty to dictate and direct us, andunless we possess and enjoy thesethings we become barren and un-fruitful before the Lord.Now, whatever the Lord requires at our hands, he does not require anything of us that we can not per-form. We can obey his command-

 LATTER-DAY SAINTS' MILLENNIAL STAR. 307home to receive their reward; but that organization has remained; theHoly Priesthood has been given to the sons of men and has remainedupon their heads, and will remain upon the heads of this people until thecoming of the Son of Man. Therefore, I say to the Latter-day Saints, we are in this organization to-day. I do not pretend to say exactly the num-ber that we have in the Priesthood; but we have from fifteen to twenty thousand Elders in this Church; we have many various organizations of the Priesthood, and churches are organized throughout the world as far as we have had an opportunity. I have been called, these Apostles have, many of the Elders have, to go to the nations of the earth and the islandsof the sea to preach the Gospel to our fellow-men. What greater calling can any man have on the face of the earth than to hold in his hands power and authority to go forth and administer in the ordinances of salvation? Do we prize these things in their fullness? I do not think we do. Nevertheless, so far we have been enabled to maintain our posi-tion, and to go forth and fulfill our missions as far as we have had time and opportunity. Certainly there has been nothing in this work that I have had greater consolation in than in preaching the Gospel to my fellow-men and in administering unto them the ordinances of the house of God, both for the living and the dead. I may say the same with regard to my brethren who are called to perform those ordinances.There was something said yesterday by the brethren with regard to our sons and our missionaries abroad. I will say for myself--and when I say it for myself I think I speak for a great many others--there is no joy that I have ever had that has been greater than that which has come to me inhaving sons receive the Holy Priesthood and go forth and administer among the nations of the earth the ordinances of life and salvation. It is a glorious gift to the sons of men. It is what men have not enjoyed before us for the last eighteen hundred years almost. Then should we notprize these things? Yes, we should. The Lord, in the dispensation of His providences, has given to us an army of sons and daughters, and our sons are called to go to the nations of the earth. We want to instill into their minds the importance of these blessings to the inhabitants of the earth and the saving of souls from sin. You give unto any soul the principles of life and salvation and administer these ordinances to him, and you become an instrument in the hands of God in the salvation of that soul. There is nothing given to the children of men that is equal to it.This is our position to-day in these mountains. We have been led here by the power of God--led by a prophet, seer and revelator, President Brigham Young, who was full of the Holy Ghost and full of revelation,appointed of the Lord, and who magnified his calling up to the hour of his death. We came here and found a barren desert. From that day till this it has been a continual growth and increase, until we have arrived ata point where we have a tabernacle as a "shadow in the daytime from the heat  *  *  *  and for a covert from storm and from rain." These things have all been prophesied of thousands of years ago by the ancientprophets and patriarchs who foresaw the work of God in the last days.I want to say a few words to our young men who are rising up among

There isno man or woman so poor but what he or she can obey the Gospel; they can go forth and be baptized for theremission of their sins, and if theykeep the commandments of the Lordhe will put into their hands powerand means to fulfill that which is required of them.I hope, brethren and sisters, that while we are together at this Con-ference, we shall have prayerful hearts, and that the Spirit of theLord may be poured out upon us; that President Young may have strength of body, and that the Spiritof God may rest upon him to suchan extent that he may be able to give the Latter-day Saints such in-struction as he may desire; and thatthe Apostles and Elders who may becalled upon to speak may be madethe instruments in the hands of theLord in conveying his word to thepeople, and that we may be united to-gether.Somebody or other has got to build up Zion; somebody has got to build Temples, and to go into them and attend to the ordinances therein.The Lord has said that he will comeand visit the earth, but before hedoes come the people have got tobe pure. The Lord Jesus has de-clared that he will come and reignon the earth, and if you read theBook of Doctrine and Covenants you will find numerons predictionsin regard to his coming, such as—"I come quickly," "I come at anhour ye think not," "My comingis at the door," "I come as a thief in the night," "I come in an hour when you are not looking for me," and "Blessed is he who is looking for the coming of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ." I say that through-out the whole of the Scriptures—the Old and New Testament, the Book of Mormon, and the Book ofDoctrine and Covenants, the second coming of the Lord is frequently referred to; and has the Lord, promised these things without in-tending to fulfill them? No, he has not, they will be fulfilled. But be-fore Christ comes, a people have gotto be prepared by being sanctified before the Lord. Temples have got to be built; Zion has got to be built up; there must be a place of safetyfor the people of God while his judg-ments are abroad in the earth, for thejudgments of God will visit the earth, there is no mistake about that, therevelations are full of promises to this effect, and as the Lord has declaredit, he will not fail in keeping his word.Brethren and sisters, let us search the revelations of God; let us look to ourselves, and understand the spirit by which we are governedand controlled in our labors andcallings. We are called to a greatcalling. The greatest calling with which any people can be called is to have placed in their hands the Gospel of Christ, and the power tobuild up his kingdom upon the earth. The Lord has chosen the weak things of the world to con-found the world, and things that arenought to bring to nought thingsthat are. He has done this in every age of the world, and he has done it in our day and generation;and he will hold us responsible forthe use we make of the holy Priesthood, the ordinances of hishouse and the power that is put into our hands to accomplish the work of God, and to build Temples to his name. If we do not do these thingsI think that we shall be under con-demnation before the Lord, and thatwe shall suffer for it.I pray God, my heavenly Father,

 308 LATTER-DAY SAINTS' MILLENIAL STAR.us. I want them to comprehend and understand the blessings that are within their reach. The Lord has given us a large number of sons and daughters. They have got to take the places of their fathers, the same as the sons of Adam had in his day and generation. A great responsibilityrests upon them. The Lord requires at the hands of our sons that they shall bear off this kingdom of our God while they dwell in the flesh, thatthey may be justified. The Lord told Oliver Cowdery, "And if it so be that you should labor all your days in crying repentance unto this people, and bring save it be one soul unto me, how great shall be your joy with him in the kingdom of my Father." It requires light, knowledge, and understanding; it requires the spirit and power of God for us to comprehend our position, our blessings, and our gifts that God has placed upon us. I feel to rejoice and thank God myself that I have lived to see what I do in these valleys of the mountains; that I have lived to see these multitudes that fill these tabernacles and temples and labor here in the building up of the kingdom of God. The Lord has been very mer-ciful to me, and my life has been preserved to pass through these things, and I still remain in the midst of this people. I have to acknowledge the hand of God in the whole of it. I suppose you have to do so with regard to your lives. The fact is, there is not a blessing that God has bestowed upon us from the beginning but has been the gift of God. We should understand this. We have preached the Gospel to every nation, kin-dred, tongue, and people, as far as the Lord has opened doors for us and we have had the privilege of going. Still the world to-day is full of people who have not heard the Gospel of Jesus Christ; and while the Priesthood rests upon our shoulders we are still under obligation and are still held responsible for the salvation of the children of men, as far as we have the privilege of bestowing these gifts upon the sons and daughters ofAdam. Only think that by embracing the Gospel of Christ we can becomeheirs of God and joint heirs with Jesus Christ, that we can have part in the first resurrection, and come forth out of our graves and be clothed with glory, immortality, and eternal lives, and pass into the presence of God and the Lamb and dwell with them eternally in the heavens! Who com-prehends this? Do the inhabitants of the earth? They do not. Satan has warred against us from the organization of this Church, to try and destroy this people; but so far we have been preserved. We should be thankful for these blessings. I realize myself that we are dependent upon the Lord in all things. The Lord is our preserver. He is the author of our salvation. Jesus Christ has laid down His life to redeem us by His blood, and through that we have these blessings bestowed upon us.Among other things, we live in a generation in which the Lord has enabled us to rear several temples--some in these mountains and some before we came here; and hundreds and thousands of people go into these temples to redeem their dead. This is a blessing the Latter-day Saints should prize. It is a duty that is required at our hands to do what we can in this direction. It is a blessing that the inhabitants of the earth have not had for centuries until this dispensation. I hope that no man who has gota record of his father's house will go down to his grave without having

 LATTER-DAY SAINTS' MILLENNIAL STAR. 309attended to this work. How would I feel, after living as long as I have, with the privileges I have had of going into these temples, to go into the spirit world without having done this work? I meet my father's house, I meet my mother's house, I meet my progenitors, and they are shut up in prison; I held the keys of their salvation, and yet did nothing for them; what would be my feelings, or what would be their feelings toward me? They would not like it. I feel that while the Lord has given us this bles-sing, every man and woman in this Church that has any faith at all in God and in the Gospel should attend to this duty. Jesus Christ, while His body lay in the tomb, went and preached to the spirits in prison, that were drowned in the days of Noah by the flood, because of their wickedness andabominations. [##1 Peter 3:19-20##] They had been in prison for a long time, and He went and preached to them, "that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit." [##1 Peter 4:6##] Joseph Smith, Hyrum Smith, David Patten, and the Apostles and Elders who have been true and faith-ful unto death have also gone to the spirits in prison in their day and time and preached the Gospel of Christ to their fathers' houses and to those who are shut up in prison, and they are laboring there for the salvation of the children of men. These are glorious principles -- principles which the Latter-day Saints should not neglect while they have the privilege and power. As I said in the beginning, there is no calling a man can be called to any greater than to have this right and privilege to go forth and save the souls of men -- save them by preaching the Gospel to them, by adminis-tering the ordinances of the house of God to them, that they may be pre-pared themselves to go into the kingdom of heaven and into a celestial glory. There are three glories. Paul in speaking upon that subject said,"There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory. So also is the resurrection of the dead." [##1 Corinthians 15:40-41##] These glories over-shadow the whole human family. Now, how much better it is for a man to receive these ordinances, that he may go where God and Christ dwell, which is the highest glory! But Jesus said in His day, "Strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it;"while "broad is the way that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat." [##Matthew 7:13-14##] I think many times that we ourselves do not prize the blessings that we enjoy and that are within our reach. Our hearts should be set upon the building up of the kingdom of God, the Zion of God, and the work of God, while we are here and have power to perform these things. It is our duty as the Presidency and as Apostles, not only to labor ourselves, but to send forth the Elders of Israel to the nations ofthe earth to proclaim the Gospel. Doors are open to-day among many ofthe nations for the spread of the Gospel of Christ, and to bring the people unto Christ, that they may receive these blessings.Brethren and sisters, this is the way I feel this morning. Of all people under heavens we should be the best, the most righteous, and the most true and faithful to God and to our fellow-men. We should be true and faith-ful to the Holy Priesthood while we have it resting upon us, and true to our labors. I rejoice at our condition to-day. I rejoice at the peace that

 310 LATTER-DAY SAINTS' MILLENNIAL STAR.has come unto us by the power and blessing of God. I rejoice at the change that is taking place in the world. We are visited now by hundredsof people from the nations of the earth. They are coming to behold the glory of Zion. They come to enquire at our hands concerning various matters, and there is a very different feeling to what there was in former days toward us. Brother John W. Taylor referred to our going to St. Louis and to Chicago. Yes, I recollect very well when we went into Jackson County, Missouri. My labors there have been alluded to. When I went on my first mission in 1834, I had to go through Jackson County on my way to Arkansas. It was just after our brethren had been driven out. I had to go and hide in the cornfields and in the brush during the day, and walk along in the night, till I got through that country, for the lives of myself and companion were in danger there. The last time I went there, the Mayor of Independence came out to meet us with a fine carriage.He had but one arm having lost the other in the army, but he gave us that arm and made us welcome. I could not help but feel the difference between then and when I went through there as a missionary. There is a change taking place.Zion is going to rise and shine, and the glory of God will rest upon her.This people, if they do their duty, will fulfil and carry out these great principles, and the eyes of the world will be turned toward Zion, and menwill come to enquire concerning the things of the kingdom of God. We arein a good condition. We are blessed of the Lord. The Latter-day Saints have never been so well off temporally. Go into the houses of the Latter-day Saints, and you will find them in a better position than they have ever been before. These are the blessings of God, and we should prize these things and give God the glory for them, while we try to do our duty and magnify our calling. I want to say that I am in for salvation and for eternal life. I have labored for that since I was a boy. I have desired the gift, and graces, and blessings manifest in the days of Jesus and His Apostles. In my childhood I prayed God that I might live to see a prophetor somebody who could teach me the principles I read in the New Testa-ment. The clergy of the day did not do it. Nobody around there appearedto believe in such things. Well, I have lived to see prophets and apostles;I have lived to travel with them and to unite with them in the kingdom of God. I have been in the apostleship fifty-eight years; I have been in the Church sixty-three years. My whole life almost has been spent in thisChurch; and from the time I came into the Church I went on missions and have never ceased altogether from that day to this. I have always rejoiced in this, and do to-day. When I die and lay down my body, I do not want anybody to rise up and say that I have neglected my duty in trying to give him salvation as far as I could. I have always rejoiced in preaching the Gospel; I have always rejoiced in administering the ordi-nances of life and salvation at home and abroad, because I have known that this was the work of God, and I know it is to-day.I want to say now to the rising generation, gird up the loins of your minds, prepare yourselves, and realize you have a mission before you. Who are going to bear this kingdom off when we go to the grave? To whom does the God of Israel look to do this? He looks to our sons and

There is nothing like it on earth. You may get the riches of the world; they pass away; but eternal life, celestial glory, a place with the righteous after resurrec-tion, with immortal bodies, are worth more than all this world can give.I have confidence to believe that the Latter-day Saints will carry out theseprinciples and magnify their calling before the Lord. I have hopes that our sons and daughters will do the same.Brethren and sisters, I say, God bless you. I am glad to meet with you.I rejoice in the Gospel, in the kingdom of God, and in the Holy Priesthood. I pray God to bless you, to open your eyes to see, and ears to hear, and your hearts to understand. I pray God to open your understanding, that you may comprehend the value and blessing of the Gospel that you havereceived and of the blessings of these temples and tabernacles in the midst of which you have the privilege of dwelling and receiving the ordinances of God. I pray that we may pursue that course that whenwe get on the other side of the veil we shall be satisfied with our record. We will find our history and our record there in the great libraryof the celestial kingdom of our God, and we will know what we have been doing in this life. If we do anything that is wrong we will be sorry forit. We should repent of wrong and try to do better. I pray that the Spirit of God may be with us to guide and direct us in our labors until weget through here, then when we pass away we may be received in the kingdom of God. We shall rejoice if we do right; for our eyes have not seen, our ears have not heard, and it has never entered into the hearts ofthe children of men the glory that lies before the sons and daughters of Adam. It is hidden from our eyes to-day, and will never be open to us until we enter into the presence of God and the Lamb. Amen. 
 Toquerville. June 2nd, 1897.Pres. Wilford Woodruff,Salt Lake City Utah.Dear Pres. Woodruff:Great pleasure is aforded me, in beingable to accept my mission to Samoa.

I realize the Samoans have souls tosave the same as the English or Germans.Will be in Salt Lake City on the 15th or 16th ofJuly to be set apart for my mission in con-nection with Bro. Ed. Smart of Provo.Hoping all plans will be carried out;I'm your brotherChauncy Spilsbury.Wm A BringhurstBishop
