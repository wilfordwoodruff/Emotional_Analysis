 1889-09-15Pres Woodruff said he was very thankful that hislife had been spared to attend the Dedication of anotherhouse for the worship of God.Father Adam before his death called together hissons and their posterity and gave them a Patriarchalblessing reaching down to the end of time.When we behold the many Temples and Tabernacleswhich have been erected for the worship of God inthe Latterdays it must be pleasing to Adam.These things are pleasing to all the Prophets who haveprophecied concerning the day in which we live.He was satisfied the Lord was pleased with it.Inasmuch as we keep the commandments of GodHis presense will be with us and His power attend us. This is the greatest of all dispensations the Lordhas given to man. We of all people have thegreatest cause to rejoice to think that we live in thisday. We will inherit the glory, the Law of which wekeep. Good and evil is set before us as with those ofour progenitors, and our free agency is given us thatwe may choose whom we will serve. We are alltempted and will be to the end of time. It willpay us to keep the commandments of God. Trustedthat we will be of one heart and mind while we are together. 
 1891-08-09 Pres W. Woodruff, fell thankful for the privilege ofmeeting with the L. D. S. in this Stake. Seek first theKingdom of God &c. The Prophets and Apostles in every age have been called to preach the Kingdomof God. They did not pay attention to what they shouldeat or drink or wear. It is so in this day. The Saints inthose days had the Holy Ghost so much so that theycould see the eternal reward for them which wasahead. They sealed their testimony with their blood.Our mission is to prepare the world for the secondcoming of our Saviour. We must not deviatefrom the way laid down by God through Hisservants. Referred to the establishment of the Gospelin the Sandwich Islands and Bro Cannons administrationhis faithfulness and integrity and the success whichhas crowned his labors. Our reward is not in thislife. He would like to live to see the Temple inSalt Lake City dedicated. Prayed God to bless the congregationand His work in all the world in the name of Jesus.

 TO THE SAINTS.MESSRS. TAYLOR & WOODRUFF:It has been so long since I addressed the saints through the medium of the Times andSeasons, that I feel confident that a few words from my pen, by way of advice, will be wellreceived, as well as a 'way mark' to guide the 'faithful' in future. I was sorry to learn, by your remarks upon the resolutions of the'Twelve' concerning your papers, which ap-peared not long since, that any of the saints abroad were more apt to patronize the com-mon newspapers of the day, than yours: For the important reason, that the church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, has the words of eternal life, and your paper, as it has hitherto done, must continue to publish such portions of them for the benefit of the saints, and thesalvation of mankind, as wisdom shall, from time to time, direct.Freedom is a sweet blessing; men have a right to take and read what papers they please:But do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? It certainly is no more than just to suppose that 'charity begins at home,' and if so, what must such as profess to be saints think, when they patronize the splendor of Babylon, and leave the virtue of Zion to linger for want of bread?Beside which, if virtue is justified rather than vanity: the best of every thing, calcula-ted to happify man, and dignify society, will, yea, must be in Nauvoo: and as the new com-mandment, given anciently was, to love one another; even so, the works of the saints, at home and abroad, will bear its own testimony; whether they love the brethren.In all the world, the Times and Seasons]- is the only paper that virtually sustains, accord-ing to the forms of Scripture and prophecy, 'apostles, prophets, evangelists and revelations and what shall be said of him that is like the 'Levite' passes on the other side of the way. When we behold men who 'have borne the heat and the burden of the day;' strug-gled against the popular opinions of a vain world, the burlesque of a giddy throng; the vulgarity of a self-wise multitude, and the false-hoods of what may justly be termed the 'civil-ized meanness of the age,' and not lend a help-ing hand? The ##Matthew 25|25th chapter of Matthew## con-tains the simple answer.Now let me say once for all, like the psalm-ist of old: 'How good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity.'As the precious ointment upon the head,that run down upon Aaron's beard, that went down to the skirts of his garments, as the dew of Hermon, that descended upon the mountains 
 of Zion, is such unity for there the Lord com-manded the blessing life forever more! Unity is power, and when the brethren as one man,sustain the 'Times and Seasons,' they sustain me, by giving a spread to the revelations, faith, works, history, and progress of the church. The brethren who conduct the paper have been appointed to that important station be-cause they are worthy and well qualified, and what a blessed sign of a faithful friend to God and man is it, to see the charity of a brother support his brethren as an evidence that he means to pass from death into life?Many of the articles which appear in the Times and Seasons, are extracts of revelations,translations, or are the united voice of confer-ences, which like 'apples of gold in baskets of silver,' are treasures more than meet for the called, chosen, and faithful among the saints; and should be more than drink to those that hunger and thirst after righteousness. As Nau-voo is rising in glory and greatness, so shall I expect to see the Times and Seasons increase in circulation by the vigilance of the elders and saints so as to be a herald of truth, and a standard of pure and undefiled religion. Fin-ally, men and brethren, when you support my friends, you support me.In the bonds of the new and everlasting covenant, I am your humble servant, JOSEPH SMITH. 
 North Columbia Cal.Dec 5 [18]92Dear Uncle, Wilford Woodruff.Undoubt-edly you will be surprisedto receive a letter from meafter my long silence. I amnot real sure that I ans-wered your letter written aftermy father's death. Closelyupon my papa's death my strengthgave way from the severe strainand for a long time I wasmiserable to think ofwriting to any one. I droppedmy social correspondense, andhave never reopened all of it.Recently I heard througha friend of mine that another friend of mine in Nevada City Cal. 
 (a Mr. Searles, lawyer) had a picture of you in a bookof his, and that the picturelooked very much likemy father, so I thoughtmaybe you would send mea picture of yourself aphotograph if you had oneto spare, if I wrote to youfor it.The Mr. Searles of whomI spoke above, is a son ofHon. Niles Searles, who was a delegate to Washington D. C. lastspring, to in behalf of themining interests of California.In your last letter tome and in fact, I think the only one I have ever receivedfrom you, you mentioned thefact of often passing throughColfax. Some time, don't you 
 think you could arrangeto run over to Nevada Cityand out to Columbia Hillfor a visit? We would be soglad to see you, I knowyou must have a great deal to occupy your time,and it is asking a gooddeal, to ask for a visit,but I hope some-day youcan come, if not for longerThis is our first pleasant day since Thanks-giving, and we enjoy thesun very much. Our wintersare not severely cold as a rule.This winter we have had agreat deal of rain. Duringthe month of November, 13.87 inthis for '92, during Nov. of 18911. and a few hundredths.That is quite a difference.

 Saint Louis October 22nd [18]56Bro WoodruffI wrote to you last from Westport Connecticut. I received nothingfrom Utah, by the September Mail.Elder Taylorfinished his narration, of the maytrdom of Joseph & Hyrum Smith. I do myself thecredit of thinking he never would haveaccomplished it, had I not remained withhim and kept his mind on the subject, as thereare many topics of exciting interest, whichdrew his attention. To edit the Mirmon aloneis abundant work for one man, and there aremany cares which necessarily surrond bro Taylorin other directions than editing the paper.I have preachedseveral times in Westport, Norwalk & neighbouringplaces. I took a violent cold, when thefall rain's commenced, it settled on my lungsand lasted three weeks. the weather has beenquite severe but is now mild and pleasant.On the morning of the 6th Octoberas I was coming from Chicago to this placein an express train, fifteen minutes before 3 O Clockit being very dark & foggy, we came in collision 
 with an express train from Alton, a generalruin was the immediate consequence, tho'miraculously no lives were lost, the brakemanhad both jaws broken, and his legs twice a piece,and one knee smashed up. A dutch doctor whowas a fellow passenger, trimmed off the smashedknee, set his other leg in two places ^&^ set hisjaws. we left him to recover if he could; aftera delay of 10 or 12 hours on the prariae, anotherTrain came along, and conveyed us on way rejoicingthat the accident was no worse.The is about 700Saints residing in St. Louis. they are principallyEuropean brethren working here to get a [fit out]they have rented the Methodist Church on4th Streat and have preaching three timesevery Sabbath.

 Portland Jany. 16th. 1856Dear Brother & SisterReally after so long atime I recd a letter from brother Wilford to dayvia California. a long wait and a long time coming.I was very glad to hear from you and that youare all so well. If for the best, hope your cropsmay be better another year. should they find youare a long ways from a market. How pleasantit must be for you to have such fine fruit as you raise there, and you must know how to appreciatehaving been deprived of it so long. I should likevery much to have a few of your fine peachesand grapes when ripe. The crops with us the past season were very abundant, probablynever more than two thirds as much ever raisedin one year as there was the last year and stillprevious one high owing in part to the trouble inEurope, which continues, but we hope there issome prospect of peace. If the money that has been expended to distroy people there, had beenused for the purchase of Bibles to distribute withthe destituate, there would be less human misery thenthere is now, no doubt. The end is not yetEngland and France may get into a quarrel,and if so the result will be disastrous. thepride of those nations are is so great, that neitherof them would be willing to yield --

 OFFICE OFThe First Presidencyof theChurch of Jesus ChristofLatter-day SaintsP. O. Box B.  Salt Lake City, Utah,  Dec. 18, 1895.Prest. James E Steele,Bingham Stake.Dear Brother:At a meeting of the First Presidency and Council of Apostles, held on Thursday, October 31st, 1895, the following decisions were reached, and are now presented for the guidance of Presidents of Stakes, Bishops, and their associate officers, and all whom they may concern:There has been a practice, in at least one of the Stakes of Zion, of High Priest, Seventies, Elders and Priests, who may have been called to act in the capacity of Teachers, having an organization distinct from that of the Teachers' Quorum and being presided over by a president and two counselors.  The tendency of such organizations has been to assume functions belonging to the legitimate councils or quorums of the priesthood. The question submitted, was, Is it proper for such organizations to exist, or to be presided over in this manner? The Council felt that it was not proper, as no provision is made for them in any of the revelations of the Lord relating to church government;  neither is there any necessity for them. And the Council decided that the brethren who bear the Melchizedek Priesthood, acting as Teachers, should not have a separate president and counselors, but that they should, when acting in this capacity, be presided over directly by the Bishopric, whose aids they are in all things connected with the well-being of the ward. 
 The second question was: At which of the meetings of the saints should persons guilty of unchastity be required to make confession  -at the general meeting of the members of the ward, at the fast meeting, or the monthly priesthood meeting? It was the mind of the Council that the regulations of confessions in such cases should be left to the Bishopric of the ward in which the wrong-doing occurs; and that each case be considered on its merits, and disposed of according to the pub-licity which has been given to it. For instance, whr^e^re people guilty of adultery or fornication confess their sin, and their transgression is known only to themselves, the confession should not be made public. But where publicity has been given to it, the confession should be made before the priesthood of the ward at the regular monthly priesthood meeting; or, if it be deemed advisable by the Bishopric that a stll more public confession should be made, it shall mean that the confession shall be made at the monthly fast meeting (which meetings are attended almost, if not, exclusively by church members) and that in no case shall confessions be made at the regular Sunday services.The object of this restriction is to confine the confession as much as possible to the circrle acquainted with the wrong-doing, and to avoid spreading the knowledge of sin, according to the revelation, which says (Doc. & Cov. Sec. 42, 89) that such things "shall be done in a meeting, and that not before the world."As a rule, therefore, where the transgression is known to but a few, the confession (if required to be made at all) should be made at the priesthood meeting, and only in such cases where the offence has become a public scandal and reproach to the church should the more public confession be required.We are, Your Brethren,Wilford Woodruff,Geo. Q. CanonJos. F. Smith

 [upside-down text]Geo. A. Smith[upside-down text]Washington D C.July 27, 1856Brother Woodruff: As a sunday morn-ing pleasure we sit down to write altho theweather is so hot that our river run like oil.The House of Representatives have refused to passthe Army appropriation Bill, without a provisothat no part of the Army should be used to supportthe Territorial Government in Kansas againstthe Free State party. Two Three weeks now closesthe session and very little can be done to benefitanybody, several hundred private Bills mustbe laid over. The Country is suffering fromsevere drouth. The general cry from all quartersis for rain. The wheat harvest has beenvery abundant. When I first came hereand learned Brother Bernhisel's feelingsI felt quite uneasy and half a notion to ^try to^ pushour Bill into the Senate Dr or no Dr, oneday while ^praying &^ reflecting upon the subject I droppedto sleep on a Soffa and dreamed, that therewas a large train of Cars that I had to startI laid hold of them and pushed with all 
 we should have power to accomplish.I have several times suggestedto the Dr the propriety of our holding prayer-meetings together. The last conversationI had with him on the subject I advisedhim to get some garments, which he doesnot wareear and has no outfit whateverfor a prayer-room; but he replied that hewas like Brother Kimball preferred to do his praying alone. I have since related to himmany circumstances that occurred with youand me on our mission through Michiganin 1844 how the Lord answerd our prayer soastonishingly in the case of M Sirvine sisterWilseys children &c and I think I shallmake a convert of him before next session.He says he asked Joseph in particular if drawersand shirts would not answer as well as garmentsIf cut &c. He is certainly one hitch olderfogy than I am on this subject.He has introduced me to many membersof Congress. He is universally respected by them

 Nauvoo Sund^a^y Evening Nov 9rth 1845Elder Woodruff I seat myself to communicate a few words to you.I have written once to you since our recent difficulties commenced & shouldhave continued to write had not the press of business & excitement pre-vented. We are all making preparations to move beyond the RockyMountains early in the Spring coming. The timber is already gotout for several hundred wagons & a multitude of men at work get-ing more & every thing possible is doing to get ready in good season.The work on the Temple is hurried with all speed, the upper roomsare being plastered & in about 3 or 4 weeks we shall be givingthe endowment to the Elders, the Lord & Governer willing: Everyscheme is in foot to get something against the twelve, Wm Smithis doing all he can in St Louis, & amongst other things he has pub-lished that "the 12 Apostles are very licentious & he for opposingthem has been cut off". He is very bitter, but has very fewfollowers, as the Saints are too well acquainted with his charac-ter to be led astray by him, as his course in the East & in Nauvoo isgeneraly known. The Twelve meet in council every day & prayfor the deliverance of the Saints from bondage, & we are heard by ourFather, & in a great number of instances have been answered to ourown astonishment, Elder Hyde has returned with 4500 yds ofCanvass for the Tabernacle. The Circuit Court went of well,not a single house burner was arrested, & all the brethren whowere charged with crime are discharged; the sheriff was recog-nised for his appearance at court to be tried for the murder ofF A Worrell, his bonds are $3000, he is exercising all the duties of sheriff,& is a brave & patriotic man & the only high officer in the State who haslived ^tried^ to maintain the supremacy of the law. (I have seen a letter from ^Br^ ElderWard to Elder O Hyde, he gave some news; I think his egotism be-speaks a slight touch of the "big head." I hope I am mistaken, but ifI am not, I believe from the Spirit of that letter, it would do himgood to travel over the mountains with us & get another kind ofexperience from that he is called to now, as a change is good, youknow better than I, every man has his own way.) We had to stopthe Nauvoo House on account of the mob. The Governor has 100 menstationed at Carthage to keep the peace as he says, but I say to plague theSaints; they have been still for a few days; All the blacklegs in the 
 country are trying to heap their crimes on us, & nothing but the power ofGod has preserved us this season, & nothing short can keep us here inpeace this Winter; be He hears our prayers every day & deliversus from their hands. We have four peices of cannon & a greatnumber of fifteen shooter rifles & many six shooter pistols & if ac[o]llision should take place with the mob we would stand a goodchance to give them a sound scrubbing; but I feel confident thatwe shall move away without the loss of life. All the brethren areanxious to go & a great many others are going with us. EldersSherwood & John S Fullmer, have been to Emmetts company& baptised them all again, they are now camped on the MissouriRiver above the mouth of the Sioux River about 700 miles from herein the Buffalo country; the Sioux Chiefs are very friendly to them &they get plenty of buffalo hmeat. Monday evening the 10th I havebeen engaged revising the church history with Brs Richards, Young,& Kimball. We read over the letters we wrote to the Times & Seasonswhen in London, this makes us think of Wilford; I find they werebadly printed. I sent a team to day to Quincy for a load of iron to fixup my wagons for Van Couver's Island, Salt Lake or some-where else. Tomorrow Br Heywood is going to make a con-tract with some iron houses for a large amount for the companies;moving is all the talk here. Elder Babbitt has gone to see theleading men in St Louis & Cincinatti to endeavor to makesale of property. We have some encouragement of rentingour Temple to the Romans. I have got 3 yoke of oxen to-wards a team to move with. We shall go principally with oxteams as they will live on grass. We shall cross the mountains at the South pass in 42 Degreses of N Latitude, & start as earlyas possible for cattle to live on grass. Emmigration is rollingin very fast; a company of Saints arrived here last night fromNorthbridge Masss; every house in the city is crowded, ourhouse contains about forty all the time. We have built allround the house I lived in, since you left here. Our towncontains over 11,000 inhabitants, we have above 20,000 peopleto move from this country next Spring, or we must fight amob composed of most of the State, & the Govr says we can-not be protected from mob violence by State authorities 
 the word is, "you must go;" & we are sick of a liberty soterrible, ^&^ freedom so very oppressive. Elder Granthas returned from Philadelphia with his family, allin good health & spirits. I have been improving in myhealth for the past year, my lungs are recovering slowly& are nearly well. Many have died this summer & fallBr Wm Gehan, Br Drollinger, Br Stephen Winchester's sonAlexander, Br John Cheese, Hannah Ells, Olive Frost,John Low, Gen Dunham died last summer in the senecanation, & many others have been called away as the fall hasbeen sickly. Notwithstanding the great amount of grainburnt by the mob, an abundance is among the Saints, to sus-tain them all; the harvest was abundant, every kind of grainis ^in^ great plenty; but the flour mills in our city are notsufficient to do the grinding for the country around.Br Richards has been sick some time, but his health isimproving, this has delayed the history. Novr 12th YesterdayI visited Br & Sister Webster, found them well & in first ratespirits, they said little Wilford was in good health & fine spi-rits, they received a letter from you a short time since [page torn]spent the day in reading the Church history; the eveningwith the council of the 12 engaged in preparing an epistleto the saints at home & abroad concerning our removal & ageneral invitation to all honorable law abiding men to ac-company us. The Bishops bought 100,000 ft of pinelumber for the finishing of the Temple & making wagonboxes. Bathsheba sends love to yourself & your kind lady.I wish to be remembered also.

I have not known of their receiving it, think if they had, I shouldhave known it.  It is very pleasant to me to hear from my friends and more to so to see them.  how much I want to see you allI should be willing to make some sacrifice to spend a few days with you or to see you here,  but it is uncertain when and where we may meet, if not on earth may it be in heavenYou refer to some unkind feelings to ward Utah, I hear of none.  Sin and iniquity abounds to a great extent with us.Our ministers are becomeing political Priests jumping out of the pulpit with politics and from politics jumping into an teasing robing that.

 Ms 1352 bx 6 fd 28 #12F Carter July 9th 1856Anserdlocated in Historian BookPuttand July 9th 56My dear Sister & BrotherYesterday I rec.d your very kind letter of June 1st, and was glad to hear from you after so long  a time,I dont know, really when I have had a letter before from you, and I fear that you do not get mine,  I was glad to hear that you are quite well,  Mr. Woodruff must have had a very severe attack and his recovery seems quite ProvidentialYou speak of my visiting you, it would afford me great pleasure to do so but when that time will come is quite uncertain.  presume your city has increased very much since I wasthere,  I have quite a number of friends there that I should like to see, Brother Hardy, Smoot, Sister [Cewand] &c. by the way how is Mrs. [Cewand] these days?  please give my regards to her and all of my old friends and acquaintace with you. 
 So they take up one humbug after anotherThey now see that they had much more reason to fear the Devil than they had the Pope,  God works in a mysterious way, and can make the wrath of men to praise HimOh that men would learn to love each other rather than to hate and injure themI was glad to hear the you are all wellEzra, Judith and Annie, have gone out well and will see Rhoda and Fabyan.They were all well a short time since and prospering.  I was at Scenlure, two days since.  Phebe, those grand old elms are as grand and majestic as ever.  When do you think you will see them, and an respected father.  you may see them, but probably not him in this world.Mouther is very poorly is now in N.Yorkunder the care of a Physician.  I think a month or two will determine something with her.  She must be helped to stand it much longer.  Our children are well our friends generally are quite well.  Mary C. Fabyan is merried to a Meth minister Ira Foes was in today done harvesting, can good Potatoes [illegible] , please write often.  I will write again soon, give much love to all..  May God keep us and bless us and may we all meet in heaven is the daily prayer of   Very truly yours [illegible] 
 We are all as well as usual.  Mrs. Carters health continues very poor..  She is now quite feeble but keeps about the most of the time.  Father was in last week and spent some days with us, he is quite well, and cotinues very smart.Aunt Fabyon is as well as usual and our friends generally at [Scenbere,] with no important changes  Mary Fabyanswill probably be married within a week,the third wife of a Methodist ministerMr [Menthen] and family are well and prospering,  I was at Scenbere, a few days since and found it very pleasantWe hear from Illinois occasionally, allquite well there now.  Rhoda is very rugged since she recovered from her severe illness.  Simon is here and in tends to spend the summer on account of his health, which is not very goodIra and family we well.  They have a young Son there which is quite gratifying to them, have quite a little family around them.

 We shall probably have quite anexciting fall, Politically, Buchanan and Fremont have been nominated for the Presidency.  B. will no doubt be electedBy our late arrivals from Europe we have very favorable prospects that peace between the two countries will be continuedbetween the two countries.  It was feared that the dismissal of the Eng. Minister at Washington and some other misunderstandings would lead to difficulty.  I am sorry to say that many of our leading Politicians of all parties, if possible, are becoming more corrupt than ever, what the result will be we cannot tell, the prospect now is that a dissolution of the Union will take place before many years, whether that would be attended with serious consequences we can hardly tell.  The evil one is very busy and he finds great numbers that he contacts.  Spiritualism is flourishing like a green bery tree, the Devels great and perhaps last harvest.

 This life, how short it is, compared with the next, and what a world of trial, disappointments and pains, but there is a land of pure delightWhat a great  thing it is to have a treasure in heaven, God be our Fatherand heaven for our home.  That is enoughThis mortel posseses but little attraction to me  on my own account, but we have friends that must be provided for.  How great our occasion for gratitude to God for all His mercies and goodness to us.  I am astonished and pained that I have so little love for Him, but I would love Him with all my heartYou and yours are always  remembered by me in my feeble prayers, and you must remember us in such occasions and if we are not permitted to meet here again upon earth may we and all our dear friends meet where sin and sorrow can never come and parting are [nere] known..  Please remember me very kindly to Mrs. Fess and family and all friends.  Mrs. Carter sends much love to all.  hoping to hear from you oftenI am very truely yours.  I. F Carter

 Washington City June 4, 1856Mr Wildord Woodruff,Dear Sir,Your communications of the 27th of March and of the 9th of April were received on the 31st ultimo.Be pleased to accept my thanks for yourkindness to my family. I presume you are apprized ere this that I have paid Messrs Sanborn & Carter one hundred and five dollars on your account.It is distressing to hear of the suffering among our people in consequence of the scarcity of provisions, and also of the loss of sheep and stock in consequence of the severity of the past winter, and by Indian depredations. The trial through which the church is now passing is doubt-less the most severe that she has ever passed through. Those who endure this chastening of the Lord without 
 apostatising, or murmuring against God, will probably endure to the end.I regret to hear that brother Cain is indisposed.  Will you be good enough to ask him what disposition he has made of my oxen and wagon, and whether he has made any arrangement to have my family supplied with wood during the present summer and the ensuing winter, also whether the two or three loads of wood due for house rent have been paid?This morning I deposited in the post office a bill of lading and bills of goods which I trust will reach you in safety.My wagon containing the goods will start from old winter quarters if it has not already started.  If you cannot raise meawhat means my family may needfrom goods and other sources, you will draw upon me for what they may 
 require. E. Snow & Co. or perhaps any other house would I suppose give you the cash for a small draft payable at one day after sight.I am quite disappointed at the course that Mr. Houtz is pursuing, he has not done as he agreed to do.Have the goodness to let me hearfrom you as often as you can conveniently.Brother Hautz was to kill thirteen hogs in December last, one fourth of them belonged to me, and after supplying my family he was to sell the pork, he was to sell the remander and hand you the money.If he has not done so, will you please to endeavor to collect it. Say to him that my family needs it. Before I left I desired you to pay brother Houtz some eight or ten dollars on account of some little improvements he proposed to make, but you will pay him nothing more, 
 Washington City, April 7, 1856Dear Brother,Inclosed is the receipt of Messrs Sanborn & Carter for one hundred and five dollars.Brother Houtz was to kill thirteenhogs in December, one fourth of which belonged to me, and the pork of which, after delivering as much to my family as they required, he was to dispose of, and pay the proceeds of the sales to you. Has he done so? Have you received any flour from him since you wrote last? Bekind enough to keep me informed how he gets on with the mill.The prospects for the speedy admission of Utah into the Union as a State aredark and gloomy.Yours in the GospelJohn M. BernhiselMr Woodruff. 
 except the good due him, if he should call for them.Yours fraternallyJohn M. Bernhisel[sideways text] J. M. Bernhisel June 4th 1856Answered July 31st 1856 [end of sidways text]

 [upside-down text] Geo. A. Smith [end of upside-down text]Washington D. C. July 15, 1856Elder W. WoodruffI received from you a very welcomeand instructing letter for which I returnyou my thanks. My mission to Wash-ington appears to be a dull affairSecretary Babbitt left here this morningfor Salt Lake. bBy him I have sent lettersto President Young My family, yourselfand many others I write this to send bymail. Our Know Nothing Congress or ratherBlack Republican House of Representativesare a regular Blue Law set of fellows, but theHouse has been occupied ever since I camehere with Kansas quarrels and SumnersCaneing evry kind of business seems to beat a stand. The House passed a Bill to admit Kansas as a Free State on theConstitution framed last winter. Theydone this for political effect knowing that itcould not pass the Senate. The Senatehave passed a Bill to authorize Kansas to form a Constitution fully believingthat the House would reject their Bill.In this manner our statesmen foolaway from their time and the real business of theCountry rejected; while foolish men quarrel with each other. 
 Since the Black Republicans and oldTom Benton have been makingsuch a muss about Govr Young andUtah & Poligamy President Pierce hasbecome somewhat Bitter in his feelingsat least Dr Bernhisel informs me that thePresidents modest feelings are annoyedwith Govr Young's interfeering with the Juries as set forth inby Bro Brigham in theTabernacle as set forth in the TabernacleFeb 24, 1856 Watts Report of which Mr Piercehas in his possession as published in the52 No of the 5th Volume ^Deseret News^ page 412 where youwill see the President sets forth the rascalityof Courts and Lawyers and to make good his feelings I suppose he has dismissedJoseph L Heywood from Office underthe impression probably that he was toohonest a man to handle Governmentfunds. He sends Judges to Utah andthey make expenses by Tens of thousandsof Dollars & these Judges force the Marshalto stand at the Back of these expenses and the Departments refuse to pay them& cannot conceive how it is possible thatanything should cost more in Utahthan in N. York. Bro Heywood got hisdischarge today. I am about appointinghim private secretary and he hopes 
 that Uncle Sam will at least be aspolite as other men are when theydismiss their hands pay upToday Dr Bernhisel Introduced me to Mr Andrew Oliver of N. York. He askedme many questions in relation to Utah &seems pleased. He is a Republican of themoderate stripe. He also introduced meto Govr Aiken member from South CarolinaAlso to Mr Cox of Kentucky a Know NothingThe business of the House is conducted insuch noisy style that it is impossible forme to understand half that is going onIn the Senate to day they ^were^ Discussinga Bill for a Road from the South Passto Minnesota Ter. I was surprised in hearingthe debate at the ignorance of ^many of^ the Senators inregard to the mountains & plains.Judge Kinney called on me yesterdayand told Dr Bernhisel & myself  "he hadnot asked President Pierce to appoint himGovr of Utah. His friends had not asked forhim either. He would not permit his friends to ask. hHe did not want the Office. The officehe now had was equally as Lucrative he couldremain at home some time and draw hisSalary without going to Utah, but if PresidentPierce tendered him the appointment without asking he would accept and go to Utah 
 alone without Troops. I can do the duties ofGovernor in Utah. I want no Troops. I donot want the Office I despise do not want the Office when I know the whole people preferGovr Young and I will accept rather as a dutyI owe to the people of Utah rather than havea man appointed who would be liable tomake trouble. Understand me if GovrYoung must be removed and I am tenderedthe Office I shall acccept. He also stated that he believed that Govr Young would beremoved. I write to you not wishingyou to publish my letter because in speakingof men & things Individually they mightcome back in a way so as to prejudicemy influence among the Devils whohave all ^got to^ be influenced to vote over ad-mission into Bedlam or we shall haveto stay out; and last not least hurt Dr Bernhisel'sfeelings" I do expect that if we had not havebeen councelled in the start to confer togetherand act being agreed that Dr Bernhisels non-committal Policy would have got awfully twistedbefore this time. The longer I remain herethe more thoroughly I became convinced that there are no independent men in congress who darestand up for their own principles of non-interventionat the present time or at least that I have notbecome aquainted with any; I have not metany but what seem to shudder at the idea of facing the music now.[sideways text] July 15, 1856Geo.

 Terre Haute Sept 27th 1837Brother WilfordI received your very kind and interestingLetter dated Rowley Mass. July 25th in its properseason and as you invited my correspondence with youat Scarborough I cannot longer deny myself thepleasure of writing you. In the perusal of the accountof your visit among the friends of our youth I assureyou I can appreciate the emotions by which you musthave been inspired and I should think myself mosthighly favored to be permitted to enjoy with yousuch an occasion. When I think of "My own dearnative land" So many and such varied associationscrowd into my mind that I can hardly determinewhether I should realise more pleasure or painfrom a visit. I have many objects of attaction andendearing interest there but there is one beforewhich all others lose their force it is foundin the magic term "My Sistre"! I have manyfriends who are very dear to me and upon whosememory I often dwell with great delight, yetmy dear brother must forgive me when I saythat the presence of my only sister in mythoughts drives every other object from myreccollection. I sometimes fear she is too muchthe idol of my heart but I pray God thatshe be not doomed to be smitten in judgmentto me. 
 It must have been gratifying to you to meetso much encouragements in your ministry among the bigotry and superstion of Farmington, andbelieve me, brother, tho, I am a wayward childI always rejoice at the success of a humbleministration of the gospel and I am proudto think I have a brother who is not ashamedto proclaim the truth where so little honoris to be expected as in one his own countryI am not ambitious to have my brothers become"able divines of the day" skilled in all thesubtleties of the craft but I shall ever be happyto learn that they are skilful dividers ofthe word of truth and mighty throughGod to the pulling down of the strong holdsof Satan. I have just received letter fromMother. She writes that the Book of Mormana copy of which I left at home is in muchdemand there it is loaned out all of the time and several applications are in advancefor the favor. I was very sorry that itbecame necessary for our people to nowreturn to T... but it was perhaps exp-edient and I hope will prove for the bestShe writes that all are well and thatthey are doing as well as they had reasonto expect Eunice is expected to go home assoon as her school is closed. 
 You talk of going to Missouri this fall but say not a word about visiting me! I cannot thinkdear W. that you can be so unkind as to failvisiting me this fall and I shall insist upon yourmaking Terre Haute a point on your routeto Mo. I should be delighted to see you andSister in Law. And I now promise myself thepleasure before many weeks. I cannot indeedpromise you much entertainment here nor doI imagine you be much pleased with me forto tell you the truth I am getting to be adisagreeable thing and do not improve muchby age, but then, I am your brother [page torn]and this will be some little excuse for youto take a little trouble to see me, besides Iknow your weakness and from this knowledgeam assured you will take a little pridein presenting me to your Phebe, who cannotbe otherwise than what your good tasteand judgment warrants me in presuming.I wrote your at Farmington sometime agoand hope you will get the Letter.I hope you will write me often.With kind wishes to Mrs Woodruff I remain, dear brotherVery Truly YoursAsahel H WoodruffWilford Woodruff

 copyToquerville Washington Co UT May 5 1889Pres Wilford Woodruff Dear Brother having returnedfrom working in the St George Temple for my DeadI asked Brother McCallister a question that he did not feelat liberty to answer But wished me to state the questionto you, just as I had stated it to him, which is a followsI went back to England on a mission in the year 1877and while there preached the Gosple to my Sister andher family and Baptised several of them, all the restbelieving and preached to her the true order of marriageand adoption of her Children her Husband was adrinking man and often acted bad to her so thatshe would not have him for Eternity but wishedto be sealed to me, when she died as she was takenvery bad with dropsey and did not Expect Everto come to Zion. I told her I did not know how thatwould be. Such things had been done but I didnot know how it would be again. Well then ifthat cannot be done I want you to have me sealedto your son Mohonri M Steele (he was then there on a mission) and my Children adopted to him and meand left the matter in my hands to see to it She diedshortly after I left England and I have had her Endow-ments attended to for her but nothing moreNow dear Brother your answer to this questionwould settle the matter and by so doing wouldwould greatly oblidge your Brother in the GospelJohn Steele

 Sabbath Morning February 23, 1833Brother  AsahelI received your line under date of Jan 2nd,& was gratified to learn that you meet with good successin your temporal undertakings. As the business your are employed inappears to prove profitable no doubt but you will do well to perseverein it And I would heartily except of your generous offer in joiningyou in canvassing two or three of these western counties if circumstanceswould permit but I stand in need of more information respecting thesubject before I can decide. You know Brother it is expensive travling5 or 6 months without any incomes & now I would like to know whoyour employers are & whether they reside in York state or Connecticut& how long we must wait for our pay. Was if those who get the subscriberscan review pay of the publishers before the Books are distributed I should thinkit best to get subscribers & let others distribute, but I conclude this is notthe case I expect they advance no funds untill the books are distributed& money collected, & if this is the case probably it would be the safest todistribute to your own subscribers then you will be sure of your pay.There is business sufficient for three of us at holm the coming seasonbut perhaps not to that profit that it would be for me to go into the Bookbusiness. We have some payments coming due in the spring which probably willtake what money we shall have. If I could procure a little money if it wasnot more than $20.00 I think I would take a [trunk] with you in the Springwhich is fast hastening. But at all events I think you will be well to take thoseCounties you spoke of & if you could get Oswego County I could helpyou canvass parts of that without much expense, as it is at holm.Whether I have any part as lat in this matter or not I hope thebusiness will continue to prove as favorable to you as it nowpresents itself And when you receive this line I wish you wouldwrite to me again & let me know the whole particulars of the businessthen I can know better how to calculate. I would like to knowwho your employers are & if those who get the subscribers must distribute theBooks & how long we must wait for our pay &c. I would like toJoin you in the business if I can procure money to pay myexpenses untill I can receieve sumthing for my labour. I dontthink of any thing ^more^ connected with this subject of importance to write.We have written to Brother Thompson & directed ourletter to Farmington stating that we wished him to come out & workwith us as soon as he could settle his business in the spring & if youshould see him let him know of it as he may have been imployedin some other place through the winter & not receieved itI shall live in hopesof seeing you in the spring if you visit this section of countryNB (I wish to be remembered to all enquiring friends Willford) 
 I am glad to hear that you are enjoying so comfortable temporal &Spiritual health. With respect to myself I have enjoyed good health throughthe winter excepting a few turns of the cholic & occasionally a rhoumaticbite but this is not to be wondered at for I should think it would give anyman the cholic to load & draw as many logs as I have thi^s^ winter fromthe shores of Lake Ontario in all kinds of weather however I have gotallmost through with it a few days more will if prospered and a wintersjob. Azmon has been employed most of the week past insleding lumber to Mexico about six miles which he exchanges forhousehold furniture & farming tools we can exchange lumber for any kind of store goods But I have allready gone more than a Sabbathdays Journey in temporal affairs.With regard to spiritual things things conserningthe Kingdom of God & my own soul I would say it would beimpious not to acknowledge the goodness of God in preserving my lifeto the present period finally what a long suffering & patient waiting God weare dealing with at times when I look at my unfaithfulness, unbelief,slow to obey prone to wander & to do evil, heart buried in the rubbish of the world while wasteing my Masters goods I feel ready to exclaim what is manthat Thou art mindful of as the son of man that Thou visitest him.

Vin-alhaven, Fox Islands, Monday, Sept. 18th, 1837.To JOSEPH SMITH Jr. AND THECHURCH OF LATTER DAY SAINTS INKIRTLAND GREETING:Dear Saints of God, whom we love of a truth for the truth' sake that dwelleth in you, and we pray God that it may abide with you forev-er: As we are called to stand upon the Islands of the sea, in defence of the truth and for the word of God and thetestimony of Jesus Christ. We are under the necessity of making use of our pen, to give you an account of our labors in the ministry since we left Kirkland, as we cannot at present speak to you face to face. We left Kirtland May 31st, and took Steamboat at Fair-port in company with Elder Milton Holmes, to go forth to labor in the vineyard as the Lord should direct.After calling on the Saints in Jefferson Co. N. Y. we arrived at Sackett's Harbour and took Steamboat on the6th of June for Upper Canada and onthe 8th arived at Brother Artemus Judd's. And on the 10th, had the hap-py privilege of setting in conference with John E. Page, James Blakes-lee, and a number other elders, and a large congregation of Saints. And we were blessed with a very interesting time. After spending several days with them we took the parting hand with these beloved friends and pro-ceeded on our journey for the East in company with elder John Goodson, and others bound for England. We took the parting hand with them at Schenec-tady, and arrived at the Canaan church in Connecticut, visited the church a few days. Here elder M. Holmes took his departure for Mass. and we went to Colebrook, visited different parts of the town and held eight meetings, from thence to Canton and held a meet-ing in the village hall in Collinsville.As we commenced speaking severalbegan to beat their drums at the doors which made much confusion. This is the only disturbance we have had since we left Kirtland. We next visited Avon, where we held four meetings and many came out to hear and mani-fest a spirit of inquiry. And elder Woodruff had the privilege of leading three of his kinfolk into the waters of baptism. And had not the Spirit call-ed us away to perform a greater work, we should have had no difficulty in es-tablishing a branch of the church in that place. A family where we tarried but one night, and taught them the things of the kingdom, believed our tes-timony, and after our departure, two of the household followed us 15 miles to receive baptism at our hands, but we were gone, and they truly believed it to be a day of warning and not of ma-ny words. We also visited Farming-ton and held one meeting in the Meth-odist meeting house, and preached to an attentive congregation who wished to hear more concerning the great work of God. We left Farmington on the 20 of July, for Mass. and after visiting the Bradford church, and after preach-ing several times with them, we pro-ceeded on our journey to Saco, Maine, where we spent several days with the church and friends. But duty urging us forward to lift the warning voice to those that had not heard the sound of the gospel, we then went to the city of Portland. We there took the Steam-er Bangor on the 19 of August, to speed us on our way to the Islands of the sea, they landed us at Owls head at the set-ting of the sun: But how to get con-veyance to the Islands we knew not, we retired to a grove and offered up our thanks unto God for his mercies and asked him to open our way before us; we returned to the Inn and soon found some men that were going near the Islands that night, they said they would land us if we chose to take pas-sage with them. We accordingly went on board, they hoisted sail and landed us on North Fox Island, Vinalhaven, at 2 o'clock Sunday morning, August 20th. It was with peculiar feelings and sensations that we began to walk forth upon one of the Islands of the sea which was wrapped in the sable shades of night, whose waters, had never cov-ered a soul for the remission of their sins after the order of the gospel, and which soil had never been press-ed by the foot steps of an elder of Is-rael. We were strangers, pilgrims, and almost pennyless. But we had

 come on the Lords business, we believ-ed him faithful that had promised, and we felt willing to trust in his name, we soon came to a house, where we were received and we retired to rest. We arose in the morning made ourselves known as servants of the Lord, we in-quired if there was any religion or priests on the Island; we were inform-ed that there was a Baptist priest, a small church and a meeting house at the center of the Island. The town of Vinalhaven includes both North and South Fox Islands: Pop. 1800. The inhabitants are generally wealthy, in-telligent, industrious, generous and hospitable to strangers. North Island is 9 miles long, and 2 wide, pop. 800. South Island is 10 miles long, and 5 wide, pop. 1000 &c. As it was Sab-bath morning there was to be preach-ing in the meeting house, we conclu-ded to attend considering it a proper place to introduce the gospel. When we arived at the place, meeting had commenced, the deacon came to the door and we informed him that we were servants of the Lord, that we had a message for the people and wished to be heard, the deacon informed the priest that we were preachers of the gospel. He invited us into the stand and gave out an appointment for us at5 o clock P.M. After the priest had closed his discourse he invited us to his house during the intermission. We presented him the book of Mormon, he appeared friendly and said he should like to read it. We met according to appointment and preached to them the first principles of the gospel. We then gave out appointments for the four fol-lowing evenings to be held at the sev-eral school houses on the Island. The people came out in great numbers and heard with attention and manifested much anxiety, and in fourteen days we held nineteen meetings. The Bap-tist priest became alarmed seeing that his craft was in danger; and fearing that if he held his peace all Fox Islands would believe on our words, accor-dingly he strove to use his influence against us, but without effect as you may judge on learning the fact that on Sunday the 27th while we met with a congregation, he had not so much as one to meet with him at his usual placeof worship, for the excitement was so great that the members of his church and deacon, were attending our meet-ings and inviting us to visit them, and inquiring into these things. The Lord clothed us with his Spirit, and we were enabled to stand up and boldly declare those things that are commanded us.And the sound thereof soon reached the neighboring Islands and some of the inhabitants soon hoisted their sails to convey them over the waters to hear the tidings for themselves. On Sun-day the 3rd of Sept. we preached to a large congregation assembled together from these Islands, at the close of our meeting we opened a door for baptism, and a respectable sea captain and his wife offered themselves as candidates, we then assembled where there was much water and after offering up our prayers unto God, we then lead them down into the sea and baptized them and we returned rejoicing. On Mon-day following we visited the South Is-land to set before them the truths of the everlasting gospel. We held five meetings, the people came out by hun-dreds, to hear and filled the school-houses to overflowing.Notwithstanding the anxiety of the people to hear more upon this impor-tant subject, yet we were under the necessity of returning to the North Is-land, to attend an appointment on Sun-day, accordingly we met and preached to the people and opened a door for baptism and another sea Captain and a young lady came forward and we re-paired to the sea shore and baptized them, and on Tuesday following, we administered the ordinance of baptism unto three others.A Methodist priest on the South Is-land fearing whereunto these things would grow, came over to the Island where we were baptizing and made friends with the Baptist priest (like Herod and Pilate) and called a meet-ing, we attended [##Luke 23:12##]. The Methodist priest arose and commenced warm hostilities against the book of Mormon, and our principles, we took minutes of his dis-course that we might be correct in an-swering him. As he could not bring proof from the word of God against our principles, and in order to make an impression upon the minds of his hearers against the work; he took the book of Mormon in his hand, and with an out stretched arm declared that he feared none of the judgments of God that would come upon him for rejecting that book as the word of God.

 he closed his meeting we arose and rectified some of his wide mistakes in his presence before the congregation, and informed the people if they would meet next Sabbath at the meeting house we would answer every ebjection that had been presented against the book of Mormon and our principles du-ring the meeting. And last Sabbath we met a congregation of several hun-dred at the meeting house, assembled together from the different Islands, and we arose in their midst, and redeemed our pledge by answering every objec-tion that had been brought against the book of Mormon, or our principles.After meeting we repaired to the water and again administered the ordinance of baptism. The Baptist priest is no less busy than his Methodist brother, for while one is in the pulpit declaring to the people, that the principles of the book of Mormon are saping the very foundation of our churches and holy religion; the other is gone over to the main land calling upon his Baptist brethren, saying come over and help us lest we fall. But cursed is man that trusteth in man or maketh flesh his arm saith the Lord God. O ye priests of Baal your cry is in vain, the God of Israel has set his hand the second time to recover his people. The stone has began to roll, and will soon become a mountain and fill the whole earth. The Lord is calling his church out of the wilderness, with her gifts and graces and restoring her judges as at the first. God has chosen the weak things of this world to confound the wise, and with them he will rend your kingdoms, that the wisdom of your wise men may perish, and the understanding of yonr prudent men may be hid. The cry of the Saints is ascending into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth for Ephraim.The horns of Joseph are begining to push the people together. The apos-tles of the Lamb of God are bearing the keys of his kingdom on the shores of Europe. Yea and the mighty Captains of the ships at sea, are receiving the gospel of Jesus Christ; and enjoying its power, and the call of many from distant Islands, has already entered our ears; O come and preach to us, we have sent a book of Mormon over the billows of the great deep, to teach those that are at sea. And the word and work are propelled by the arm of JEHOVAH. And the weapon that is formed against Zion shall soon be broken. And he that raises his puny arm against it, is fighting against God and shall soon mourn because of his loss. We say these things are true as God liveth, and the Spirit beareth rec-ord and the record is true, and ven-geance will be speedily executed upon an evil work in these last days, there-fore, O Babylon thy fall is sure.Although we have not baptized but few on these Islands, yet there is hun-dreds believing and many are almost ready to enter into the kingdom, the calls are numerous from the neighbor-ing Islands, and also from the main land, for us to come and preach unto them, and tell them words whereby they may be saved from the pending judgments that await the world. There are fifteen or twenty neighboring Islands that are inhabited, some of them con-tain a population of several thousand. And while the fields are white, we view the harvest great in this country: and the laborers few. And while we are faithfully laboring day and night for the salvation of his people; we ask an interest in your prayers, O ye Saints of the most high God. O ye elders of Israel will ye not go forth in-to the vineyard and help wind up the scene of this generation which sits in darkness and in the shadow of death.  O ye ministers of our God, if we alto-gether hold our peace at this time, shall we not suffer loss when the Lord raises up deliverance unto Israel. But for Zion's sake let us not hold our peace, and for Jerusalem s sake let us not rest until the light thereof go forth as bright-ness and salvation as a lamp that burn-eth.That we all may keep the patience and faith of the Saints and see that no man take our crown, is the prayer of your brethren in the Lord Jesus.WILLFORD WOODRUFF,JOHNATHAN H.

 TIMES AND SEASONS."Truth will prevail."Vol. III. No. 12.]-  CITY OF NAUVOO, ILL. APRIL 15, 1842. -[Whole No. 48.For the Times and Seasons.SABBATH SCENE IN NAUVOO;March 20th 1842.A large assembly of Saints gathered together at the place of meeting at an early hour, to hear a discourse delivered by President Joseph Smith, upon the subject of Baptism. A child of Mr. Windsor P. Lyons being deseased, the body of which lay before the assembly, called forth many remarks from the speaker upon the subject of death and the resurrection, which were in the highest degree interesting and edifying, as were also his remarks upon the subject of baptism.The following is a brief synopsis of some of the items delivered by the speaker.President Smith read the ##Revelations 14|14th chap. of Rev.##and said,"We have again the warning voice sounded in our midst which shows the uncertainty of human life; and in my leisure moments I have meditated upon the subject, and asked the question, Why it is that infants, innocent chil-dren are taken away from us? especially those that seem to be the most intelligent and inter-esting? and the strongest reasons that present themselves to my mind are these: This world is a very wicked world; and it is a proverb that the 'world grows weaker and wiser' if it is the case, the world grows more wicked and corrupt. In the early ages of the world, a righte-ous man, and a man of God, and of intelligence, had a better chance to do good, to be believedand received, than at the present day; but in these days such a man is much opp[os]ed and persecuted by most of the inhabitants of the earth; and he has much sorrow to pass through here, the Lord takes many away even in in-fancy that they may escape the envy of man,and the sorrows and evils of this present world;they were too pure, too lovely, to live on earth; therefore if rightly considered instead of mourning we have reason to rejoice as they are delivered from evil, and we shall soon havethem again."What chance is there for infidelity when we are parting with our friends almost daily?None at all. The infidel will grasp at every straw for help until death stares him in the face, and then his infidelity takes its flight, for the realities of the eternal world are resting upon him in mighty power; and when every earthly support and prop fails him, he then sensibly feels the eternal truths of the immor-tality of the soul. We should take warning and not wait for the death bed to repent, as we see the infant taken away by death, so may the youth and middle aged, as well as the infant suddenly be called into eternity.Let this then prove as a warning to all, not to procrastinate repentance, or wait till a deathbed; for it is the will of God that man should repent, and serve him in health, and inthe strength, and power of his mind, in order to secure his blessing; and not wait until he is called to die. Also the doctrine of Baptiz-ing children, or sprinkling them, or they must welter in hell is a doctrine not true, not sup-ported in Holy writ, and is not consistent with the character of God. All children are re-deemed by the blood of Jesus Christ, and the moment that children leave this world they are taken to the bosom of Abraham. The only difference between the old and young dying, is, one lives longer in heaven, and eternal light and glory than the other, and is freed a little sooner from this miserable wicked world.Notwithstanding all this glory, we for a mo-ment lose sight of it, and mourn the loss; but we do not mourn as those without hope."My intention was, to have spoken upon the subject of baptism, but having a case of death before us I thought proper to refer to that subject. I will now however say a few words upon baptism, as I intended. God has made certain decrees which are fixed, and immovable, for instance; God set the sun, the moon, and the stars in the heavens; and gave them their laws, conditions, and bounds which they cannot pass, except by his commandments; they all move in perfect harmony in their sphere, and order, and are as lights, wonders, and signs unto us. The sea also has its bounds which it cannot pass. God has set many signs on the earth, as well as in the heavens, for in-stance; the oak of the forest, the fruit of the tree, the herb of the field; all bear a sign that seed hath been planted there; for it is a decree of the Lord that every tree, plant, and herb, bearing seed, should bring forth of its kind, and cannot come forth after any other law, or prin-ciple. Upon the same principle do I contend that baptism is a sign ordained of God, for the believer in Christ to take upon himself in order to enter into the kingdom of God, "for except ye are born of water, and of the spirit ye can-not enter into the kingdom of God," [##John 3:5##] saith the Saviour. It is a sign, and commandment which 
 God has set for man to enter into his Kingdom.Those who seek to enter in any other way willseek in vain; and God will not receive them,neither will the angels acknowledge their works as accepted; for they have not obeyedthe ordinances, nor attended to the signs which God ordained for the salvation of man, to prepare him for; and give him a title to a celestial glory; and God has decreed that all who will not obey his voice shall not escape the damnation of hell. What is the damnation of hell? to go with that society who have not obeyed his commands. Baptism is a sign to God, to Angels, and to heaven that we do the will of God: and there is no other way beneath the heavens whereby God hath ordained for man to come to him, to be saved, and enter into the kingdom of God, except faith in Jesus Christ; repentance, and baptism for the remis-sion of sins, and any other course is in vain;then you have the promise of the gift of the Holy Ghost. What is the sign of the healing of the sick? the laying on of hands is the sign, or way marked out by James; and the custom of the ancient Saints as ordered by the Lord; and we can not obtain the blessing by pur-suing any other course, except the way marked out by the Lord.What if we should attempt to get the gift of the Holy Ghost through any other means, ex-cept the signs, or way which God hath ap-pointed? should we obtain it? certainly not; all other means would fail. The Lord says do so, and so, and I will bless, so, and so.There are certain key-words, and signs belong-ing to the priesthood, which must be observed in order to obtain the blessing, the sign of Peter was to repent, and be baptized for the remission of sins, with the promise of the gift of the Holy Ghost: and in no other way is thegift of the Holy Ghost obtained. There is a difference between the Holy Ghost, and the gift of the Holy Ghost. Cornelius received the Holy Ghost before he was baptized; which was the convincing power of God unto him ofthe truth of the gospel; but he could not receivethe gift of the Holy Ghost until after he wasbaptized. Had he not taken this sign, or or-dinance upon him, the Holy Ghost which con-vinced him of the truth of God, would have left him. Until he obeyed these ordinances and received the gift of the Holy Ghost, by the laying on of hands, according to the order of God, he could not have healed the sick, or commanded an evil spirit to come out of a man,and it obey him; for the spirits might say unto him, as they did to the sons of Sceva; 'Paul we know; and Jesus we know, but who are ye!' [##Acts 19:15##] It mattereth not whether we live long or short on the earth after we come to a knowl-edge of these principles and obey them unto the end. I know that all men will be damned if they do not come in the way which he hath opened; and this is the way marked out by the word of the Lord."As concerning the resurrection I will mere-ly say that all men will come from the grave as they lie down, whether old or young, there will not be 'added unto their stature one cubit;'neither taken from it; all will be raised by the power of God, having spirit in their bodies, and not blood. Children will be enthroned in the presence of God, and the Lamb; with bodies of the same stature that they had on earth; hav-ing been redeemed by the blood of the Lamb,they will there enjoy the fulness of that lightglory, and intelligence which is prepared inthe Celestial kingdom: 'Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord; for they rest from their labors and their works do follow them.' [##Revelations 14:13##]The speaker before closing called upon the assembly before him, to humble themselves in faith before God, and in mighty prayer and fasting to call upon the name of the Lord,until the elements were purified over our heads,and the earth sanctified under our feet; that the inhabitants of this city may escape the power of disease and pestilence, and the destroyer that rideth upon the face of the earth; and that the Holy Spirit of God may rest upon this vast multitude. At the close of the meeting Presi-dent Smith informed the congregation that heshould attend to the ordinance of Baptism in the river near his house, at 2 o'clock; and at the appointed hour the bank of the Mississippi was lined with a multitude of people, and Pres-ident Joseph Smith went forth into the river and baptized with his own hands 80 persons, for the remission of their sins; and what added joy to the scene was, that the first person bap-tized was Mr. L. D. Wasson, a nephew of Mrs Emma Smith; the first of her kindred that have embraced the fulness of the Gospel.At the close of this interesting scene the ad-ministrator lifted up his hands towards heaven,and implored the blessing of God to rest upon the people; and truly the spirit of God did restupon the multitude, to the joy and consolation of our hearts. After baptism the congregation again repaired to the grove, near the Temple,to attend to the ordinance of confirmation; and, notwithstanding, President Smith hadspoken in the open air to the people, and stood in the water and baptized about 80 persons, about 50 of those baptized received their con-firmation under his hands, in the after part of 
 Farmington Nov 28 1845Dear Son WilfordIt is now Thanksgiving eve with us, & wehave been waiting in earnest expectation for a number of weeks tohear from you again. I should have written you eer this, had it not been for the consequent ersults of the late trouble at the west zvivz the determinations of the church to remove to a more hospitable clime&c &c, & as we your Parents verily supposed, their son Wilford wouldnever engage in this great enterprize without first visiting ^his native^ landbecause firstly, they were conscious that he not only had children inhis native Land but also some property there which they concludedhe must of necessity attend to before he left these united States,& secondly that he had Parents there who had for some time pastbeen looking to him as one who, in some not very distand  period wouldprobably be able & willing to assist them in gathering with the Saints& their other dear children who had gone thither & whom they muchwished to see, & that now as the church had determined upon a removeacross the Rocky Mountains to California surely they thought itcould not be long before he would be returning to the West & makecalculations to call on them to stir them up & assist them in preparingfor the great event viz to aid them on to the West & give them a littletime to rest & visit their Children untill the opening of the springwhen they wocould all both Parents & Children be prepared to take theirfinal leave with the church & in the strength of Israels God engagin the Rocky Mou scaling the flinty Mountains I thought soon afterwe had the account that the church would all remove, & told yourfather, that I would write as it was high time we had, but that it wasnot certain but that you might have had the news sooner, as soon a[s]we & that you might be returning before a Letter could get to you &knowing your zeal in things pertaining to the Kingdomof God we finally thot best to omit writing you, your father hadoften said I wonder Wilford dont write us or, that we do notrecieve a communication from him, if he is coming on this fall& this, we surely thot you would do & when your father said, I dontknow how W. will be visit for the means to assist us in goingthe answer was at hand, viz that I thought & felt that as he hadfrom time to time assisted the Saints especially when in Englandto come to America that that they might go to the Land of Zion& that now, as he would in all probability desire to help hisParents & other relatives to go with the church that the Lord woldopen & prepare the way before him by granting him meanssufficient to accomplish the desired object. Indeed your father& myself have fell much on the subject I can say that it has lookedvery pleasent to me to think of going even across the Rocky Mountains 
 Indeed I have had a great choice in view of going by Land & yourFather said, before the trouble at the west after reading a descripti-on of California that there was no place in the world where heshould like to go as well as to California but, enough of this strainWe have rec'd a Letter from our Children at Nauvoo, to day, & it was the firstwe have had since their trouble, & it was with a trembling hand, that I brokethe seal, yet we learned therefrom that they were all in the Land of theliving, & in somewhat comfortable circumstance, yet the contents of the same were such in general as to sicken our hearts & give us theworst of feelings but what, you will ask, did it contain. Why, in thefirst place our children spoke of the removal of the church as thothey had no part nor lot in the matter, & principily because they hadno means to assist themselves to go & no information that anyone wouldlend a helping hand to assist them, there is something Wilford thatlooks quite dark to us in this affair & there seems to be a good deal ofit too if we can judge anything from their communication & herearises a question in our hearts which seems at this time hard to be solvedviz, can these things be of God, but now Wilford you will say, Mother Imust be crazy, but I can tell you Son W. that for near thirty years yourMothers mind, or the exercises of the same have in almost every instancewhere any thing of a serious nature was about to transpire have provedto ^be^ as a preface to the final result & now I now not how to understand theexcercises of mind I have had of late, when contrasted with present appear-ances, our Children write that you have been counciled to go Direct fromEngland to California. If a thunbolt had racked our house I shouldnot have been more astounded than upon reading this declaration. I haveever believed since I became aquainted with spiritual things that thework of the Lord never clashed, but here is something that looks somuch like it, that I am filled with wonder & astonishment, now Iwould ask one question or two, has not President Young been madeaquainted with the fact, that you had Parents who were in the declineof life, & [w]ho of course looked to you as their all as it were especially asto the privige of gathering with the Saints & that altho they have othersons who would gladly receive their society & do all that lay thatlay in their power to render them every necessary assistance but that after all, the moment they should  go to dwell with or near by their sons they would be constrained to give up their religion or theprinciples of the Gospel unless they should conclude to live in onecontinual conflict as have the Saints in Illinois I say has Presid-dent Young been made aquainted with these facts as also that youhave an only Sister residing in Nauvoo, who has for a number of years past been in a very peculiarly afflicted state not only in reg-ard to her own health but also on the account of the misfortunesof her companion in life, & consequently would stand in specialneed of some little assistance from her Brother in such an import-ant crisis as the present but if this has not been the case It does appear 
 to me that he ought to be informed forthwith. I am of the opinionthat there could not probably be found one in the whole church whovolunteering to emigrate with the Saints in England would subjugate sogreat a number to the heartrending trials which must necessarlyensue upon your departure frome the Isle of Great Brition to the Territoryof California. We have as a family in former years seemed to be marked outas it were with special blessings from the hand of God, but in thepresent case it seems that we are like like to be marked out (either by thehand of God, or that of Man for special disappointment. I have never expe-rienced any thing that looked to me so unreconcileable as the councili-ng you to start from England for it does seem to me that reason &discretion as well as the gospel principles of the Gospel would lead tohaving a case for natural friends in such an immergency for if suchfriends do ^not^ manifest a case who will. It appears that Eunice & Webster have nothad the information as to ^the^ Saints removal that your father & myself have had viz the article written by Mr Hastings on the advantages of emigrationto California the account of the richness of fertility of the soil the spontane-ous productions of the same, the arrangements & rules laid down for theJourneying thither &c &c or I am sure they would have exspressed themselvesdifferently on the subject, they say that the church had determined on removingnot really beyound the bounds of time & space but to a place where they can havea little more space & also peace, that they were in fact going into the wildernessprobably far beyond the Rocky Mountains the Identical spot they do not knowthat the spirit of persecution had become so strong that the church could stay the[re] [no]longer, but, (they add) if they do not see such a time of hardships, privations & dangersin this undertaking that they have never before experienced, they shall be muchmistaken as they can have nothing to subsist upon but what they take along withthem, that the rich in Nauvoo, had covenanted together to assist their poor to goafter preparing themselves, but as ^for^ its being a possible thing for them to help theirpoor near all away, it could not possibly be done, that they had that. Wilford would comethat way & bring us along, as it would be the last opportunity we should haveof gathering with the Saints, that as to themselves they could make no calculationabout the Journey, as they had nothing to calculate with but E. says I wouldnot like to miss of going with the church, &c &c, for my part after perusing thethe accounts of California it looked to me that it would be altogethe better for theChurch if they could get there & as to the journey there has been nothing inthat which looked dark if performed, & arranged according to the directions ofMr Hastings but has looked pleasantly to me, & I believe also to your father butI have but a short time since written to Cousen Betsey encouraging her in thebelief that that they would in all probability have an opportunity of goingwith the church & that I had every reason so to do, as I had read over & over thatit was the intention to take all the Saints, & surely I thought our family connectionwould stand a good a chance as any others, & we could probably each family ofus raise somewhat towards the exspences & that by having your assistance wemight be prepared or even if there should be a little wanting we might obtainthat from the church or some other way I have felt as tho should your father laythe matter before some of our neighbors he might probably get some assistance 
 [sideways text] Why Son Wilford what a predicament your Parents& their friends would be in suppose you should actuallygo as we have had intimation. I cannot think, it will beso, if for no other reason than this, that your Parentscould never again say, that they had not been conf-ounded while endeavouring to trust in the Lord god ofIsrael, & the scriptures tell us that such shall never beconfounded in worlds without end, now I do not supposethat if indeed President Young has given such councilto you that it proves that he is not ordinarly possessed ofas much wisdom as any ^other^ person on the earth, but ratherhis having so much business to attend to did not think to [end of sideways text]enquire whether you had ^not^ Parents & otherfriends whom it would be your dutyto see to on this important occasion, butthe special predicament I illerded towould be this, that we your Parents would not either be with the churchnor get to our children at Nauvoo, nor theyto us, because they would not be able to doof themselves alone. It does actually seemthe most strange thing in the worldthat since you are the only Male memberin our family who has any connectionwith this church that the minds of the Twelve have ^not^ had a consciouslyness of theresponsibility is resting upon you inregard to your somewhat numerous frie-nds for Indeed had your Father a suf-ficent supply of means to help us onthe journey still, you know we should need your aid, & as you are so well acq-uainted with travelling, & your fatherso little, but I have filled my sheet yousee & some over.

 Terre Haute Dec 10th 1837Dear brotherYou enquire in your last whether Iget the "Latter Dayy Saints" from Kirtland. I do andam obliged for the favor but to whom I am indebted I donot know unless yourself I have read some of the com-munications in the "Elders Journal" with a good deal of interest but I must have leave to say that I do not admire the style and spirit of the Letter from Englandparticularly that part which related to the pious devotionof brother Kemball to his wife and children and JesusChrist. I do not perceive any necessary connection in ideabetween the crucifixion of JOur Savior and the welfareof ones wife and children and why the latter clausewas added I cannot conceive unless to prevent thejealousy of his wife.It is very seldom that I get Letters from home the latesthowever render accounts of good health and generalprosperity I believe the situation of our family inFarmington is more agreeable than before the sojournin Colebrook. Mother and Eunice express theirsatisfaction with the advantages of good society whichthey enjoy and I immagine they improve it betterthan they formerly did. They write that they receiveevery desireable attention.You will recollect that I was interrupted in my last, inthe pursuit of an interesting subject, by an "inexpressible"but I am happy to assure you that no harm was done or other effect produced than the Excitement of a few sensations which soon wore off leaving me cool and calm.But to return I was speaking of the confusion 
 produced in my mind by your mention of the changein Sister Eunice. If she was not our only sister orif I was less sensitive or less susceptible of the warmersensibilities of human nature I should probably never haveoccasion to allude to my sister in refference to any changein me. There is indeed a change in me since you saw mebut in some respects it is not such a change as you would naturally expect to find. In that particular respect in which I have not advanced to that state ^tone^ of character which you would expect and to which Ishall refer you. I trace the cause to my deepdefvotion to my sister the interest I have feellt inher and my great ansxiety for her. Instead of anadvance with my years to the deportment of manhoodand to the pursuits and tastes of ripen years I ammore childish in feeling and deportment than whenyou saw me last. It appears to me that trifles whichwould be objects of desire at the age of twelve affordme as much gratification as at that period of my lifeand in the choice of companions I am never so wellpleased as in the company of boys and girls.In selecting my female associates I hardly ever choosethose over 12 or 14 years for past that age theyare in my estimation past the age of lovlinessperfect loveliness. And to think of paying mycourt to a young Lady within 3 or 4 years of myown age would seem an absurdity which I couldscarcely surmount. If I have a coat at the Tailorsit is as much an object of desire with me to see itcompleted as with a boy to get a new Hat. And[sideways text] I have not demonstrated very clearly my premises, that my character [end of sideways text] 
 when any new tho, unimportant arrangement is accomplished in my business I am as much elatedas is the same boy when he gets permission to spenda week at his uncles in the city. And if a girlof 13 does not return my tenderness (meekness?)my passions rage like a burning volcano. Thereason of all which I believe may be found in myardent devotion to my sister. If for the last five yearsI have had a desire to live to prosper to acquirereputation wealth and respectability the excitingimpulse has been my regard for her. I havelived for her I have toiled for her and forher only have I struggled against theadversities of fortune that she might beblessed that in me she might find succourand support. She has dwelt continually inmy mind has occupied my first thoughtsand when in my happier moments I have thoughtmyself blessed this cloud that has soonestspread over my joy has been the reflection thatshe could not share with me my happiness The image of my sister which has so often beenpictured to my imagination has been that of thegirl of 13 which that I left at my fathers houseI have never been able to fancy her in any othercharacter than that of the little girl I used to leadabout by the hand.

 Terre Haute July 22 1837Brother Wilford.I received witH pleasure your letter datedFarmington 7th Inst and read it over and over with muchsatisfaction. I am much interested in the account of yourvisit among our common friends and I know not that anythingcould afford me higher pleasure than to participate with you inthe joy of such an occasion. It has been our lot to be seperatedfor a long time and under circumstances rather unusual.Yet it does not appear to me that there can be any reason toapprehend that the kindred ties that which unite us have in anydegree loosened their bond. We are still brothers  and friendsand while we have a sister a mother and a common fatheraround whom to rally the purer sentiments of our hearts,have we not a mutual pledge of Enduring affection ofbrotherly love? I am aware that the correspondence that haspassed between us since we parted has not been of a characterto evidence the highest degree of brotherly regard forwe have been perplexed with the cares and anxieties of lifeand by the mysterious phenomena of mind have beenwidely seperated in our views hence it is not strange thatour intercourse has been interrupted. But we do notlook to the regular and uniform interchange of writtencommunication for a pledge of each other's affection wehave this assurance in the nature of our relations andin our capacity to appreciate Each others claim.You intimate the apprehension that your letters have notinterested me you are mistaken I have ever read your letters with satisfaction and have only at times wishedthat they contained a more particular account of yourpersonal affairs, being more interested in them thanin the great "common cause". 
 With regard to "Mormonism" I suppose we do not differmuch about its peculiar doctrines. In the application ofthe principles of these doctrines, however I imagine I shallnot for some time be able to see the propriety of the coursepursued by Mormons. I do not indeed believe that theprominent doctrines of the sect are peculiar to "Mormonismproper". These doctrines have been maintained ever sincethe gospel was preached by a large number of every sectand I have yet to be satisfied that these popular doctrineswere not introduced into the Mormon Economy in anarbitrary manner to decare the influence and favorof that respectable portion of community.So it respects the inspiration of the "Book of Mormon"and of "Mr Smith" (the prophet) or indeed any of the pretensions of the "Saints" of which I am informed I donot think them unreasonable. I do not know but they^are^ in perfect accordance with the revelation of thedoctrine of Jesus Christ as presented to us in theBible but I have yet to be convinced that they aremore than empty pretensions. Every prominentdoctrine of Mormonism may true be true, while theleaders of the sect, those indeed who assume to them-selves the high prerogation of teachers from Godto man may be rotten in heart, corrupt in lifeand ignorant of the first principle of holy religionThese are some of my views. I entertain a dear respectfor the cause and tho I have sometimes spoke lightlyof it as in some of my letters to my friends it hasnot been with the intention to ridicule, but ratherto gratify my propensity to amuse myself at theexpense of others. 
 You see I employ the term "Mormon" whenrefering to your church. I do this respectfully andonly because it is the most convenient term I canfind. And I can discover no impropriety in it forother sects on designated by some popular termand it would be nonsense for "Latter Day Saints"to deny that they are a sect for ^they are^ as thoroughly identifiedwith sectarianism as other churches.I hope you will write to me again soon and may Inot expect the pleasure of seeing you here in the courseof the fall. I think you would do well to visit thispart of the "Vineyard" and which perhaps you ^will^ think all-most equal to Zion. This is a beautifull countrybut sin stalks abroad in the land and blights herfa[page torn] charms.[page torn] present my highest regard to your "companionin love" and believe meMost Truly YoursAsahel H WoodruffWilford WoodruffP.S Accept my thanks for the "Bank  Note" you sent me.

 Terre Haute July 22nd 1838.Sunday A. M.Ever dear brother.I have now before me three unanswered letters from you havingdates, "Vinal Haven March 10th" "Scarborough May 2thnd" and Farmington June 26th 1838. From one so prone to complain of the neglect of correspondents asI am, such delinquency as this comes with a bad grace, and I would offer anapology for an excuse, but then I hate excuses, and so will substitute an expl-anation. I have not been inattentive to your letters nor have I lacked a feeling ofdeep interest in them, but I have so weighed them. And have so felt the importanceof the subject which has generally and mainly employed your pen that I have des-ired to return appropriate answers. And hence have delayed from day to day andfrom week to week for time to do justice to your favors untill so much matter has accumulated upon which I should be pleased to communicate my reflectionsthat I fear my pen recoils as I now attempt to direct it. I have been sokindly disposed towards you as to pass the "firm resolve" to answer your every letter, andto give you line for line and thought for thought nay morey I have laid otherplans for your entertainment and perhaps amusement. I have designed giving you suchdetails of "the way the world has gone with me" since I parted with you at [Richland],that you would be enabled to see before you as "large as life" your little brother,and comprehend the object of his existence but I have deferred the matter untill I should have "a more convenient season" and so time which waiteth for noman has imperceptibly glided away while I have not discharged ^even^ the immediateduties of brother to brother much less have I accomplished thou high designs which I had conceived for your gratification as the unaffected offeringsof friend to friend. And this is but the history of my whole concernfromFrom my earliest life I have been continually laying plans for future("greatness", shall I say?) nay whatever may have been my frailties and foibles I have not had ^added^ the folly of aspiring to greatness., my plans have beenof future goodness and usefulness. In early life I became enamoured of thecharms of virtue, and the aspirations of my heart were after goodness and truth my ambition led me to aspirey high indeed but after humility and meeknessand it was in the lowliness of my mind that at a very tender age I well remem-ber feeling the kindlings of a virtuous pride in anticipations of future goodnessand usefulness. But ah! how sadly have my well formed but ill timed plansbeen frustrated The accursed spirit of procrastination has been the cankerworm of my degradation, What has been to me the duty of to day has beenmade the business of to morrow. And to morrow has not come!!I am aware that it is common place confession to speak of one's misimproved time, And to acknowledge the sin and folly of procrastination is but a modest wayof intimating that we are not righteous over much but brother it is the history of scenes of no common folly and neglect that I here divulge and if you couldperceive as I feel the sickly barrenness of my mind and the polluted sinfulness of my heart and could be persuaded as I am that it is all the result ofputting off untill to morrow the business of to day you would indeed [groan]at my calamity. It is a fact that in relation to the acquisition of knowledgefrom books and from observation, to the cultivation of my mind by the proper exercise of my intellect, to the encouragement of virtuous disposition in my heart and the inclination to become good and win, as wellas in relation to the management of pecuniary matters and all thingsappertaining to my life and the various relations I have procrastinatedevery thing but my folly. 
 In your letter of March 10th you very kindly utter the wish that you could "commune withsome "Heavenly Messenger" and give vent before him to your feelings concerning tho towhom you are bound by the ties or consanguinity" That you are often present in the spirit withthou with whom you are bound by the ties of nature I have no doubt and it is a source of muchsatisfaction to me to believe that I enjoy a liberal share of your regard that I do not deservemuch of your consideration is a reflection ungrateful indeed to me but nevertheless quite trueunless my appreciation of your worth and a tender regard for you as a brother and friendentitles me to a corresponding degree of your regard. I have felt a good deal ofinterest in the accounts you give of your travels in the ministry more particularly per-haps because it is a matter which concerns your welfare though I per am unwillingto admit that I do not feel a good deal of interest also in the progress the work inwhich you are so successfully engaged. I have followed you to the far west to thefield of contest and there my apprehensions were excited for you as well as account ofyour exposure to the evil designs of the world as to the contagious malady whichprevailed to so alarming and degree. My excitement was of a feverish character.I feared that the hand of the violent man would fall upon you that the abuses ofthe vulgar and the coarse minded would be heaped upon your head as upon the headof an outlaw and a ruffian, and that no voice would be heard in your defensedeclaring that you were innocent of any evil designs upon the peace of comm-unity. Then the work came as on the wings of the wind that a deadly contagionhad visited your camp and that scores had already fallen before you andcould I rest and be at peace while my brother stood exposed to the shaftsof death! But another word came which told of the breaking up ofyour bandy of its disperson to East and to the South to the North and tothe West and you were placed before me a wanderer over the fairof the Earth in the capacity of a preacher of doctrines which were a by-word and a proverb among men. I already fancied I saw you exposedto the ridicule and the scoffs of bigots, hypocrites unbelievers wicked men anddevils and was pained at indignities and insults which I imagined werebeing heaped upon you and I had not even the consolation of knowing that you wereengaged in the cause of God (for then indeed I could have endured to see you suffer persecution, under the full persuasion that you would beblessed and honored by the King of Saints) though I did not doubt thatyou believed you were doing right and that you bore along with ^you^ a clearconscience and an honest heart. Many long months passed away and I heardnot a word respecting you   what might have befallen you I was in doubts andbutI felt a fearful apprehension that you something ill had befallen you. Anangry insurrection had been plotted and was discovered just upon the eveof its breaking out the people of the South were inflamed and theirvengeance was visited upon many innocent and unsuspecting persons, there was no liberty of speech there and a person had only to be suspected ofentertaining sentiments appored to some of the institutions of the Southto be visited with all the horrors of a hellish anarchy. Under these circum-stances my emmotions were such as I cannot well ^express^ my fears were of thegloomist character for I knew your enthusiasm and your determinationto maintain your priviledges rights as an American citisen perhaps in yoursentiments you were appored to the institution of slavery and in the fearof God you would be constrained to raise your voice against it, a coursewhich would have brought upon you swift destruction from the presence of men and my forebodings were bitter indeed. If I had any hope foryour safety it was in the kind care of providence I had no confidencein the protection which would be afforded you in the plea that you 
 were a free citizen of this republic during that dark "reign of terror". ButI was permitted once more to hail your return to your friends, and to rejoice in the triumphyou had thus gained over the enemy and had the happiness once more to peruse thelines dictated by your brotherly kindness. I saw you engage in preparing yourselffor the more efficient discharge of your duties as a minister of grace and amongyour fellows I imagined you giving and receiving counsel in relation to matters app-ertaining to the interests of "the Church" I saw you taking upon yourself the floweryyoke of matrimony and, (believe me) I rejoiced in the consideration that in subm-itting your neck to the yoke you had found a true yoke-fellow in whom youmight not only find an assistant bearer of your burdens and sharer of your sorrows andjoys but also an agreeable companion who should sweeten the sorrows of your life,and heighten the enjoyments of your happier hours by her cheerful smile and devotedlove. I saw you bending your way to the far East to enter a new field, even to speakthe word to the "Islands of the Sea". I followed you in your journeyings and saw youcommence your labors upon the Islands rejoice in your sucess prayed foryour comfort and safety lamented the bigotry and intolerance you encountered,and left ashamed with you that men, nay that those who present themselvesto the world as ambassadors from the Court of Heaven, should so far departfrom the principles of spirit of enlightened, liberal, & republican principles(to say nothing of the principles of the religion they profess) as did thoupreachers and Elders who so ungenerously opposed you. Fools that they are!to believe in a God and to worship him in the forms of his religion and at thesame time to have so little confidence in His cause as to fear and quake lesta handful of "Mormons" should upturn there it root and branch! I followedyou on your return to the main land and accompanied you again to the land of yourbirth, was with you in spirit aroundat a fathers house and did not envyyou the paternal affection and maternal tenderness which you there enjoyedand in the fulness of a brothers heart I did not forget to yield to youthe entire devotion of a sisters heart. It was indeed a priviledge which youenjoyed to spend so pleasant a season at home and I should have been happy[therin] happy to have made one in the family circle on that occasion. But how soon I shall enjoy that pleasure with you or whether such happiness is inreserve for me at all is a subject I do not like to reflect upon. But I havenot forgotten that previous to your last visit at home you went to New Yorkthat you then met with your bre[thren] from Europe and heard from them ofthe progress of the "work" in a foreign land. I went up the North Riverwith you and across the hills and dales to Connecticut. Conjured up all the familiar faces in Avon, Lovely street cider brooks &c &c and broughtthem up to hear the mormon preacher, and [have] several times gone downwith you to the solumn waters of baptism. All them and many otherpicturesscenes have I frequently imagined myself a witness of and this hastyand imperfect outline so imperfectly drawn (in my haste) has affordedthe subject of many a picture which I have dwelt upon with muchinterest drawing so largely upon my imagination it would be expectedthat many of the scenes which I should represent to myself would be merefancy sketches and I presume that in following your amid the diver-sified scenes of the last few years of your life I have often followed you ata great distance and sometimes perhaps have mistook^aken^ your way. That Ihave not fully ^properly^ appreciated the spirit by which your steps have been directedI think is more than probable for indeed I am incompetent to judge with regardto the character of the cause in which you have been engaged I have ^having^ neverbeen able to avail myself of such information as would enable me to formadequate ideas of the origin character and tendency of Mormonism. 
 Brother, I have repeated to you that I feel interested in the question of MormonismI again repeat that I am deeply so. There then no other reason than that I have abrother who is identified with the leaders of the Society this would be sufficient groundfor any interest which I may feel. But when to there is added the consideration that myfather my mother and my only sister as well as many other friends are underits influence and are liable to become members of the society it becomes doublymy interest and duty to enquire if the doctrine be true. If Mormonismis the work of God and the peculiarities of Mormonism are founded inEternal Truth I desire to know it. If it is true then my highest interestand the highest interest and the highest interest of my friends is involvedin our embracing it with all its terms. If it is untrue or if in other termsMormonism proper and peculiar is not founded inupon direct revelationfrom Heaven God forbid that one of us should be under its influenceanother day. That the prominent doctrines of Mormonism are in generalcorrect and are even more reasonable than perhaps ^those of^ any other sects I amready enough to believe but then their doctrines may all be true foundedupon correct principles and yet Joseph Smith Jr may be as arrant[as known] and as great an impostor as ever lived. if this is the casewe can renounce Mormonism and at the same time retain every correct principle and doctrine which it embodies. But I must [close]I will only now add that I am bound to believe Joseph Smith Jr and allthe leaders of your society honest men untill it is disproved. Yet Ihave no proof of the truth of their pretensions except the admissionyou have made and they are not satisfactory to me not being asexplicit as I could wish. I shall probably trouble you with some questions regardingthis subject before long and shall hold you responsible for the result of the sameby virtue of the interest which we mutually have in an only sister who is inclinedto become a member of the Church of the Latter Days Saints. Hold yourselfready and peradventure you may make a believer of me and to God shall beall the glory.[sideways text][end sideways text][sideways text-right]Please permit me to pay my compliments to Mrs Woodruff andexcuse my impoliteness in doing so in so obscenea corner as this.

 Terre Haute Nov 24th 1837Dear brotherYour letter dated Vinal haven. Oct 20th is beforeme and has been perused over and over with much satisfactionI thank you sincerely for this token of your regard, and am the moregratified with the favor from the indications which it manifeststhat you desire my correspondence. In responding to your wishesin this respect permit me to assure you I anticipate great pleasure.I believe that a well regulated correspondence may be both interestingand profitable and, situated as we are I can perceive no reasonwhy we should decline its advantages. And indeed when we considerthe relation we sustain to each other what reason can we find to justifysuch neglect? An unreserved correspondence with you has for along time been an object of desire with me. I embrace thenthwith pleasure the priviledge (which I think the Spirit of yourletter warrants me in inferring you will grant) and hope I shallhereafter be permitted to consider you a regular correspondent.I hope you will write me often, and without regard to order inrefference to my answers for we are both so situated that wecannot at all times observe regularity in our communicationWe must write, then, whenever we are in the "mood" trustingto circumstances for matter.There is much in your letter I should like to nanswer, but must contentmyself with noticing a part only. Could a brothers heart find anything more prominent in your letter than that which relates to hisonly sister? You strike a tender chord when you allude to thisobject of my first regard and when you speak of the change, timehas wrought in her you bewilder my brain you excite withinme a struggle between my imagination and my judgment, whichshows me too plainly my weakness Confound it!! will youbelieve that just as I ^was^ expressing the last sentence a pretty facedgirl of 14 years, of "undoubled character" who is in the habit ofvisiting every body came plump in upon ^me^ and took her seat closeby me poking her head right into my face, exciting prettysensations? to mix with those ^sentiments^ I was just indulging in. It wouldbe a sin to resume the sacred subject. So while the fair one (?)is looking at the picture books I will only nadd that sisteris at home in Farmington, attending the Academy, that I long to see her and if I don't forget where I left off I willresume to the sentimental again, and render the passagecomplete and the idea intelligible. 
 Next in turn as connected with the subject I was so unfortunatelyinterrupted in pursuing, would come the change in me, but hereI am at total loss, the matter being so completely involved in theformer subject that I could not discuss it except in connectionso you will please have the goodness to wait unttill untill I takeup the former again when I promise to present thelatter free from obscurity. But lest you should by somestrange vaguary get the notion that I am ^in^ the way to bea great man I will here promise that you will be sadlydisappointed when you are informed with regard to mycharacter. I honestly fear I shall never meet the expectationsof those of my friends whose anticipations were the mostmoderate, much less those whose partiality led them tosuppose me a clever fellow.You enquire whether I have "any intelligence from brother Azmonand family or Thompson" I presume I know nothing of themthat you did not learn at home, for the last I heard from themwas in a letter from home before you visited. Neither of themhave written to me except Azmon wrote one letter perhapseighteen months ago God bless them! if He don't I really don'tknow who will have an opportunity to do so soon.You also enquire about my business and when I think of going East, to the latter I reply I have been thinking of going Eastnext "two months" for the last two and half years, whenI shall so digest my thoughts as to be able to reduce themto practice I do not know, probably, however next SpringBusiness has been generally (as you will anticipate) dullthe last season throughout this part of the country, for reasons which all intelligent persons are acquainted withit is however improving and the prospect for nextyear is fair. Produce will be 75 ^5025 or 30^ pr ct lowerthis winter than last, which will in fact be nearer thereal value than former prices.Our business I mean the business of Woodruff & Smithhas been as good as we anticipated, and is increasingThe amount of our sales of Books & Stationery for thefirst year ending in September last was (over) 
 between Eleven and twelve thousand dollars, thisand when it is considered that we have done this withoutcapital and under the disadvantages incidental tothe establishment of a new house and have been ableto meet all our engagagements unassisted we challengeany establishment in the West to produce a better resultof first years opperations. If we have not profiteddirectly, I have not doubt we have established acharacter for business which is worth the trouble wehave been at to acquire.I am much interested in the amount of your success in the ministryand I hope continual success commensurate with your talentsand application will be the reward of your labors. I thank youfor the information you give respecting that section of countrySuch intillegence will be always grateful to a mind whichdesires knowledge. Mr Smith my partner was in Illinoisnot long since he saw one of the Derrings from Avon.Mr Derring mentioned you to him, told him that heheard you preach in South Canton and what wasmore silly than all added h that you were [page torn] [the worst]Preacher" he ever heard.

 [sideways text]Rec'd Apr. 11 - 1888 ans'd [Apr.] 12 - [1888] -[end of sideways text]PRESIDENT'S OFFICE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST.OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS.GIBSON MILLER & RICHARDSON OMAHA.P. O. BOX B.Salt Lake City, U. T.  April 5th 1888.Elder Joseph F. Smith, Washington, D. C.Dear Brother Joseph F.:A longer time has elapsed since our last communication to you than we intended; but we have been so engrossed with business and con-stant meetings of the Council that this is the first leisure we have had to send you a letter in acknow-ledgement of several that we have received from you. The following dispatch was sent to you yesterday:"Sayer write fully concerming your ar-rangements for emigration to Teasdale immediately. Through rate from Liverpool to Salt Lake fixed at fifty five dollars. Instruct Teasdale to collect through fares as usual and 
 pay them to Huntington agent at Liverpool and cableme amount to make up railroad fares and I will for-ward to Newport News. Request him to ascertain fare from Copenhagen and cable me."We hope it reached you safely and that you have been able to communicate fully with Brother Teas-dale (who seems greatly exercised concerning the emigration) so that he might be able to make his arrangements for transportation from the Continent. Several of his letters of late have been very strongly pleading against any change. I have written him to-day upon these points and explained to him the position and informed him that though Guions were our friends and we felt kindly disposed to them, yet this was not a matter of senti-ment, but of money. Our poor people were not able to pay large amounts and it was quite a consideration with us to have a low fare. Besides, Mr. Huntington had been an undeviating friend of ours for many years in political matters and had rendered us aid on many occasions, and always responded when called upon; so 
 that we were not leaving Guions to go to someone who had no regard for us. He seems to be troubled about transportation from the Continent and seems to think that no one can have the same advantages that the GuionsCo. has had in this respect. But before we engaged with the Guions Co. our people were brought from the Continent without any difficulty, and we presume by a little management they can again be transported toLiverpool in the same way.Malu (The news that you have written us con-cerning your interviews with Maude and Dellie has been very satisfactory. Their letters also have been quite encouraging, and Maude is particularly kind in his expressions concerning yourself and the associations they have had with you. We trust that their labors there have been of benefit and that the effect in our favor will be apparent to our brethren, without their knowing how these results are brought about. Maudewrites that he is overworked and almost broken down, 
 so we suppose he has had plenty to do for other parties as well as for us.)We regret that Brother John W. Young should feel oppressed either with monetary embarrassments or with any depression of mind. It certainly would have given everyone of his friends great pleasure to have seen him continue his labors in connection with yourself and the brethren, and not to have allowed any improper feel-ing to arise within him concerning our action as a committee, or yourself and the brethren as individuals. We certainly have had no feelings but those of theutmost kindness and friendliness towards him, and it has been a cause of regret that we should be com-pelled to say or do anything that would wound his feelings in the least degree.The statements which you make concern-ing your expenditures are quite satisfactory. How much more pleasant it would have been for all of us had Bro. John W. taken the same course that you have! 
 Mal(We can understand how the impression which Maudesays is prevalent respecting their being "millions" to buy up Congress should get out. The style in which Bro. John W. has moved and the lavish manner in which he has used means would naturally create such an impression and would operate against an economical campaign.)You ask what accounts you should con-sider as coming under the control of the Committee. The understanding you have got that Mr. Gibson and Mr. Curtis and the Republican are all arrangements outside of the State movement is correct. These gentle-men were employed and the arrangement was made with the Republican some time before the State move-ment was thought about, and whatever means havebeen paid out of the "Fund" to these parties should be separated from the "Fund" account and charged to the account to which they were formerly charged. Your own expenses, and the expenses of the brethren
