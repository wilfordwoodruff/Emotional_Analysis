 1889-09-15Pres Woodruff said he was very thankful that his life had been spared to attend the Dedication of another house for the worship of God.  Father Adam before his death called together his sons and their posterity and gave them a Patriarchal blessing reaching down to the end of time.  When we behold the many Temples and Tabernacles which have been erected for the worship of God in the Latterdays it must be pleasing to Adam. These things are pleasing to all the Prophets who have prophecied concerning the day in which we live. He was satisfied the Lord was pleased with it. Inasmuch as we keep the commandments of God His presense will be with us and His power attend  us. This is the greatest of all dispensations the Lord has given to man. We of all people have the greatest cause to rejoice to think that we live in this day. We will inherit the glory, the Law of which we keep. Good and evil is set before us as with those of our progenitors, and our free agency is given us that we may choose whom we will serve. We are all tempted and will be to the end of time. It will pay us to keep the commandments of God. Trusted that we will be of one heart and mind while we  are together. 
 1891-08-09 Pres W. Woodruff, fell thankful for the privilege of meeting with the L. D. S. in this Stake. Seek first the Kingdom of God &c. The Prophets and Apostles in  every age have been called to preach the Kingdom of God. They did not pay attention to what they should eat or drink or wear. It is so in this day. The Saints in those days had the Holy Ghost so much so that they could see the eternal reward for them which was ahead. They sealed their testimony with their blood. Our mission is to prepare the world for the second coming of our Saviour. We must not deviate from the way laid down by God through His servants. Referred to the establishment of the Gospel in the Sandwich Islands and Bro Cannons administration his faithfulness and integrity and the success which has crowned his labors. Our reward is not in this life. He would like to live to see the Temple in Salt Lake City dedicated. Prayed God to bless the congregation and His work in all the world in the name of Jesus.

 TO THE SAINTS.  MESSRS. TAYLOR & WOODRUFF:  It has been so long since I addressed the  saints through the medium of the Times and Seasons, that I feel confident that a few words  from my pen, by way of advice, will be well received, as well as a 'way mark' to guide the  'faithful' in future. I was sorry to learn, by  your remarks upon the resolutions of the 'Twelve' concerning your papers, which ap- peared not long since, that any of the saints  abroad were more apt to patronize the com- mon newspapers of the day, than yours: For  the important reason, that the church of Jesus  Christ of Latter Day Saints, has the words of  eternal life, and your paper, as it has hitherto  done, must continue to publish such portions  of them for the benefit of the saints, and the salvation of mankind, as wisdom shall, from  time to time, direct.  Freedom is a sweet blessing; men have a  right to take and read what papers they please: But do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of  thistles? It certainly is no more than just to  suppose that 'charity begins at home,' and if so,  what must such as profess to be saints think,  when they patronize the splendor of Babylon,  and leave the virtue of Zion to linger for want  of bread?  Beside which, if virtue is justified rather  than vanity: the best of every thing, calcula- ted to happify man, and dignify society, will,  yea, must be in Nauvoo: and as the new com- mandment, given anciently was, to love one  another; even so, the works of the saints, at  home and abroad, will bear its own testimony;  whether they love the brethren.  In all the world, the Times and Seasons]- is  the only paper that virtually sustains, accord- ing to the forms of Scripture and prophecy,  'apostles, prophets, evangelists and revelations  and what shall be said of him that is like  the 'Levite' passes on the other side of the  way. When we behold men who 'have borne  the heat and the burden of the day;' strug- gled against the popular opinions of a vain  world, the burlesque of a giddy throng; the  vulgarity of a self-wise multitude, and the false- hoods of what may justly be termed the 'civil- ized meanness of the age,' and not lend a help- ing hand? The ##Matthew 25|25th chapter of Matthew## con- tains the simple answer.  Now let me say once for all, like the psalm- ist of old: 'How good and how pleasant it is  for brethren to dwell together in unity.'  As the precious ointment upon the head, that run down upon Aaron's beard, that went  down to the skirts of his garments, as the dew  of Hermon, that descended upon the mountains 
 of Zion, is such unity for there the Lord com- manded the blessing life forever more! Unity  is power, and when the brethren as one man, sustain the 'Times and Seasons,' they sustain  me, by giving a spread to the revelations, faith,  works, history, and progress of the church.  The brethren who conduct the paper have  been appointed to that important station be- cause they are worthy and well qualified, and  what a blessed sign of a faithful friend to God  and man is it, to see the charity of a brother  support his brethren as an evidence that he  means to pass from death into life?  Many of the articles which appear in the  Times and Seasons, are extracts of revelations, translations, or are the united voice of confer- ences, which like 'apples of gold in baskets of  silver,' are treasures more than meet for the  called, chosen, and faithful among the saints;  and should be more than drink to those that  hunger and thirst after righteousness. As Nau- voo is rising in glory and greatness, so shall I  expect to see the Times and Seasons increase in  circulation by the vigilance of the elders and  saints so as to be a herald of truth, and a  standard of pure and undefiled religion. Fin- ally, men and brethren, when you support my  friends, you support me.  In the bonds of the  new and everlasting  covenant, I am your  humble servant,  JOSEPH SMITH. 
 North Columbia Cal. Dec 5 [18]92  Dear Uncle, Wilford Woodruff.  Undoubt- edly you will be surprised to receive a letter from me after my long silence. I am not real sure that I ans- wered your letter written after my father's death. Closely upon my papa's death my strength gave way from the severe strain and for a long time I was miserable to think of writing to any one. I dropped my social correspondense, and have never reopened all  of it.  Recently I heard through a friend of mine that another  friend of mine in Nevada City Cal. 
 (a Mr. Searles, lawyer) had a  picture of you in a book of his, and that the picture looked very much like my father, so I thought maybe you would send me a picture of yourself a photograph if you had one to spare, if I wrote to you for it.  The Mr. Searles of whom I spoke above, is a son of Hon. Niles Searles, who was a  delegate to Washington D. C. last spring, to in behalf of the mining interests of California.  In your last letter to me and in fact, I think the  only one I have ever received from you, you mentioned the fact of often passing through Colfax. Some time, don't you 
 think you could arrange to run over to Nevada City and out to Columbia Hill for a visit? We would be so glad to see you, I know you must have a great  deal to occupy your time, and it is asking a good deal, to ask for a visit, but I hope some-day you can come, if not for longer  This is our first  pleasant day since Thanks- giving, and we enjoy the sun very much. Our winters are not severely cold as a rule. This winter we have had a great deal of rain. During the month of November, 13.87 in this for '92, during Nov. of 1891 1. and a few hundredths. That is quite a difference.

 Saint Louis October 22nd [18]56  Bro Woodruff  I wrote to you last  from Westport Connecticut. I received nothing from Utah, by the September Mail.  Elder Taylor finished his narration, of the maytrdom of  Joseph & Hyrum Smith. I do myself the credit of thinking he never would have accomplished it, had I not remained with him and kept his mind on the subject, as there are many topics of exciting interest, which drew his attention. To edit the Mirmon alone is abundant work for one man, and there are many cares which necessarily surrond bro Taylor in other directions than editing the paper.  I have preached several times in Westport, Norwalk & neighbouring places. I took a violent cold, when the fall rain's commenced, it settled on my lungs and lasted three weeks. the weather has been quite severe but is now mild and pleasant.  On the morning of the 6th October as I was coming from Chicago to this place in an express train, fifteen minutes before 3 O Clock it being very dark & foggy, we came in collision 
 with an express train from Alton, a general ruin was the immediate consequence, tho' miraculously no lives were lost, the brakeman had both jaws broken, and his legs twice a piece, and one knee smashed up. A dutch doctor who was a fellow passenger, trimmed off the smashed knee, set his other leg in two places ^&^ set his jaws. we left him to recover if he could; after a delay of 10 or 12 hours on the prariae, another Train came along, and conveyed us on way rejoicing that the accident was no worse.

A considerable number of strangers attend on the Sabbath evenings, and appear to give good attention.  Elder Snows health has been poor since I have been here. he negotiated drafts drawn by Elder Spencer on the Liverpool Office to the amount of some 4 or 5 thousand pounds for the benefit of the Emigration fund. these drafts have been protested by Bro Pratt for nonpayment, and the long list of forfeitures, damages, [duns], and the devil know's what, which are the result of such a transaction, have a tenden[cy] 
 to keep down his Spirits, producing in my mind a visible effect upon his health, which is at best rather poor. theserough these circum- stances, he has not yet been enabled to republish the Luminary. Bro Snow has been ^is^ borrowing small sums of money wherever he can, in order to pacify these claimants. He has sent Elder Coward to England, to try and effect some arrangements, to meet these drafts, the error appears to have been committed, through a misunderstanding of Bro Spencer, as to the amount of funds, the Liverpool Office had to dispose of, had thy matter been understood as it really was, the drafts might have been disposed of at 90 days sight, ^or longer^ and have arvided the forfeitures per cent, damages, loss of credit, and caused annoyances, growing out of a return of protested paper.  The recent State Elections in Pensylvania & Indiana, show favorable for the election of Buchannan, should Fillmore carry a few Southern States, it may go to the House. The know nothing and Democrat papers pronounce Freemont's cake to be dough, as he could not be possibly be elected, without Indiana or Pensylvania, as no Slave State  will go for him. Sixteen Democratic members of Congress have been returned from Pensylvania 
 which show, that the Douglas doctrine the non intervention, in the domestic affairs of Territories, is rather on the gain, in the Keystone State, there being only 6 at the last election.  Please call and see my wife and children and give them a good word of advice. I may be able to do you as good a turn some day.  Give my respects to the Clerks in the Office and all enquiring friends.

 Portland Jany. 16th. 1856  Dear Brother & Sister  Really after so long a time I recd a letter from brother Wilford to day via California. a long wait and a long time coming. I was very glad to hear from you and that you are all so well. If for the best, hope your crops may be better another year. should they find you are a long ways from a market. How pleasant it must be for you to have such fine fruit as you  raise there, and you must know how to appreciate having been deprived of it so long. I should like very much to have a few of your fine peaches and grapes when ripe. The crops with us the  past season were very abundant, probably never more than two thirds as much ever raised in one year as there was the last year and still previous one high owing in part to the trouble in Europe, which continues, but we hope there is some prospect of peace. If the money that has  been expended to distroy people there, had been used for the purchase of Bibles to distribute with the destituate, there would be less human misery then there is now, no doubt. The end is not yet England and France may get into a quarrel, and if so the result will be disastrous. the pride of those nations are is so great, that neither of them would be willing to yield -- 
 I have no news of importance to communicate. matters and things move along about as usual. Our friends at Scarbor[ough] are as well as usual. Father continues smart. Aunt Mary Fabyan is as well as usual. Jonathan Foss was buried last Saturday, has lived alone since his wife died. Abial Carters wife at Concord is dead. Presume you have heard that Fabyons wife is dead. She died some three months since, was sick about two weeks. our friends at Illinois are  all as well as usual. Meuther has just returned from New York, where she has been for the past four months in the care of one old family doctor I don't know as she is any better. her health is very poor and a little thing might carry her off. our children are as well as usual and grew finally, are getting quite large. how much we want to see your family. presume they have grown out of one knowledge, Ezra and family are well.  We are having a great quantity of snow this winter. it was late, but we now have enough. Our winters in Maine are very severe. I wish I could be somewhere else with my family, but it seems that I am to remain here for the present. I hope to hear from you often, and will write you. I fear you have not got many of my letters the past season as there has been so much trouble with the Indians. Please remember us kindly to all our friends, Meuther sends much love May God bless you and yours and permit us all to meet when there is no more parting is the prayer of  very truly yours I. F.

 Bishop Andrew Moffitt:  Please notify John Williams of Manti and his stepsons Michael and Anthony James Cook Elisha Edwards & Judge Wm. F. Maylet of their appointment to the mission of strengthening the Southern Settlements of the territory. It will be necessary for them to perform the mission in person and not by Substitute, and be advisable for them to start as early this fall as possible, as winter is the time most suitable to make improvements. In fulfilment of this mission the blessing of the Lord upon those who labor for the enlargement of Zion will rest upon them abundantly.  G. S. L. City Oct. 16, 1865  John Taylor W. Woodruff Geo A.

 OFFICE OF The First Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints  P. O. Box B.  Salt Lake City, Utah,  Dec. 18, 1895.  Prest. James E Steele,  Bingham Stake.  Dear Brother:  At a meeting of the First Presidency and Council of  Apostles, held on Thursday, October 31st, 1895, the following decisions  were reached, and are now presented for the guidance of Presidents of  Stakes, Bishops, and their associate officers, and all whom they may  concern:  There has been a practice, in at least one of the Stakes  of Zion, of High Priest, Seventies, Elders and Priests, who may have  been called to act in the capacity of Teachers, having an organization  distinct from that of the Teachers' Quorum and being presided over by a  president and two counselors.  The tendency of such organizations has  been to assume functions belonging to the legitimate councils or  quorums of the priesthood. The question submitted, was, Is it proper for  such organizations to exist, or to be presided over in this manner? The  Council felt that it was not proper, as no provision is made for them  in any of the revelations of the Lord relating to church government;   neither is there any necessity for them. And the Council decided that  the brethren who bear the Melchizedek Priesthood, acting as Teachers,  should not have a separate president and counselors, but that they  should, when acting in this capacity, be presided over directly by the  Bishopric, whose aids they are in all things connected with the well- being of the ward. 
 The second question was: At which of the meetings of the saints  should persons guilty of unchastity be required to make confession  - at the general meeting of the members of the ward, at the fast meeting,  or the monthly priesthood meeting? It was the mind of the Council that  the regulations of confessions in such cases should be left to the  Bishopric of the ward in which the wrong-doing occurs; and that each  case be considered on its merits, and disposed of according to the pub- licity which has been given to it. For instance, whr^e^re people guilty  of adultery or fornication confess their sin, and their transgression  is known only to themselves, the confession should not be made public.  But where publicity has been given to it, the confession should be made  before the priesthood of the ward at the regular monthly priesthood  meeting; or, if it be deemed advisable by the Bishopric that a stll more  public confession should be made, it shall mean that the confession  shall be made at the monthly fast meeting (which meetings are attended  almost, if not, exclusively by church members) and that in no case shall  confessions be made at the regular Sunday services.  The object of this restriction is to confine the confession  as much as possible to the circrle acquainted with the wrong-doing, and  to avoid spreading the knowledge of sin, according to the revelation,  which says (Doc. & Cov. Sec. 42, 89) that such things "shall be done in  a meeting, and that not before the world."  As a rule, therefore, where the transgression is known to but  a few, the confession (if required to be made at all) should be made at  the priesthood meeting, and only in such cases where the offence has  become a public scandal and reproach to the church should the more  public confession be required.  We are, Your Brethren,  Wilford Woodruff, Geo. Q. Canon Jos. F. Smith

 [upside-down text] Geo. A. Smith [upside-down text]  Washington D C. July 27, 1856  Brother Woodruff: As a sunday morn- ing pleasure we sit down to write altho the weather is so hot that our river run like oil.  The House of Representatives have refused to pass the Army appropriation Bill, without a proviso that no part of the Army should be used to support the Territorial Government in Kansas against the Free State party. Two Three weeks now closes the session and very little can be done to benefit anybody, several hundred private Bills must be laid over. The Country is suffering from severe drouth. The general cry from all quarters is for rain. The wheat harvest has been very abundant. When I first came here and learned Brother Bernhisel's feelings I felt quite uneasy and half a notion to ^try to^ push our Bill into the Senate Dr or no Dr, one day while ^praying &^ reflecting upon the subject I dropped to sleep on a Soffa and dreamed, that there was a large train of Cars that I had to start I laid hold of them and pushed with all 
 we should have power to accomplish.  I have several times suggested to the Dr the propriety of our holding prayer- meetings together. The last conversation I had with him on the subject I advised him to get some garments, which he does not wareear and has no outfit whatever for a prayer-room; but he replied that he was like Brother Kimball preferred to do his  praying alone. I have since related to him many circumstances that occurred with you and me on our mission through Michigan in 1844 how the Lord answerd our prayer so astonishingly in the case of M Sirvine sister Wilseys children &c and I think I shall make a convert of him before next session. He says he asked Joseph in particular if drawers and shirts would not answer as well as garments If cut &c. He is certainly one hitch older fogy than I am on this subject.  He has introduced me to many members of Congress. He is universally respected by them

President Pierce is about the smallest man in the City judging from the manner in which they treat  him   even the Democratic Senate have passed several Bills over the Presidents Vetoes Douglas, Cass, Dodge and other leading Democrats voting against Pierce. All the papers that I have  seen except the Washington Union are down upon Pierce.

 Nauvoo Sund^a^y Evening Nov 9rth 1845  Elder Woodruff I seat myself to communicate a few words to you. I have written once to you since our recent difficulties commenced & should have continued to write had not the press of business & excitement pre- vented. We are all making preparations to move beyond the Rocky Mountains early in the Spring coming. The timber is already got out for several hundred wagons & a multitude of men at work get- ing more & every thing possible is doing to get ready in good season. The work on the Temple is hurried with all speed, the upper rooms are being plastered & in about 3 or 4 weeks we shall be giving the endowment to the Elders, the Lord & Governer willing: Every scheme is in foot to get something against the twelve, Wm Smith is doing all he can in St Louis, & amongst other things he has pub- lished that "the 12 Apostles are very licentious & he for opposing them has been cut off". He is very bitter, but has very few followers, as the Saints are too well acquainted with his charac- ter to be led astray by him, as his course in the East & in Nauvoo is generaly known. The Twelve meet in council every day & pray for the deliverance of the Saints from bondage, & we are heard by our Father, & in a great number of instances have been answered to our own astonishment, Elder Hyde has returned with 4500 yds of Canvass for the Tabernacle. The Circuit Court went of well, not a single house burner was arrested, & all the brethren who were charged with crime are discharged; the sheriff was recog- nised for his appearance at court to be tried for the murder of F A Worrell, his bonds are $3000, he is exercising all the duties of sheriff, & is a brave & patriotic man & the only high officer in the State who has lived ^tried^ to maintain the supremacy of the law. (I have seen a letter from ^Br^ Elder Ward to Elder O Hyde, he gave some news; I think his egotism be- speaks a slight touch of the "big head." I hope I am mistaken, but if I am not, I believe from the Spirit of that letter, it would do him good to travel over the mountains with us & get another kind of experience from that he is called to now, as a change is good, you know better than I, every man has his own way.) We had to stop the Nauvoo House on account of the mob. The Governor has 100 men stationed at Carthage to keep the peace as he says, but I say to plague the Saints; they have been still for a few days; All the blacklegs in the 
 country are trying to heap their crimes on us, & nothing but the power of God has preserved us this season, & nothing short can keep us here in peace this Winter; be He hears our prayers every day & delivers us from their hands. We have four peices of cannon & a great number of fifteen shooter rifles & many six shooter pistols & if a c[o]llision should take place with the mob we would stand a good chance to give them a sound scrubbing; but I feel confident that we shall move away without the loss of life. All the brethren are anxious to go & a great many others are going with us. Elders Sherwood & John S Fullmer, have been to Emmetts company & baptised them all again, they are now camped on the Missouri River above the mouth of the Sioux River about 700 miles from here in the Buffalo country; the Sioux Chiefs are very friendly to them & they get plenty of buffalo hmeat. Monday evening the 10th I have been engaged revising the church history with Brs Richards, Young, & Kimball. We read over the letters we wrote to the Times & Seasons when in London, this makes us think of Wilford; I find they were badly printed. I sent a team to day to Quincy for a load of iron to fix up my wagons for Van Couver's Island, Salt Lake or some- where else. Tomorrow Br Heywood is going to make a con- tract with some iron houses for a large amount for the companies; moving is all the talk here. Elder Babbitt has gone to see the leading men in St Louis & Cincinatti to endeavor to make sale of property. We have some encouragement of renting our Temple to the Romans. I have got 3 yoke of oxen to- wards a team to move with. We shall go principally with ox teams as they will live on grass. We shall cross the mountains  at the South pass in 42 Degreses of N Latitude, & start as early as possible for cattle to live on grass. Emmigration is rolling in very fast; a company of Saints arrived here last night from Northbridge Masss; every house in the city is crowded, our house contains about forty all the time. We have built all round the house I lived in, since you left here. Our town contains over 11,000 inhabitants, we have above 20,000 people to move from this country next Spring, or we must fight a mob composed of most of the State, & the Govr says we can- not be protected from mob violence by State authorities 
 the word is, "you must go;" & we are sick of a liberty so terrible, ^&^ freedom so very oppressive. Elder Grant has returned from Philadelphia with his family, all in good health & spirits. I have been improving in my health for the past year, my lungs are recovering slowly & are nearly well. Many have died this summer & fall Br Wm Gehan, Br Drollinger, Br Stephen Winchester's son Alexander, Br John Cheese, Hannah Ells, Olive Frost, John Low, Gen Dunham died last summer in the seneca nation, & many others have been called away as the fall has been sickly. Notwithstanding the great amount of grain burnt by the mob, an abundance is among the Saints, to sus- tain them all; the harvest was abundant, every kind of grain is ^in^ great plenty; but the flour mills in our city are not sufficient to do the grinding for the country around. Br Richards has been sick some time, but his health is improving, this has delayed the history. Novr 12th Yesterday I visited Br & Sister Webster, found them well & in first rate spirits, they said little Wilford was in good health & fine spi- rits, they received a letter from you a short time since [page torn] spent the day in reading the Church history; the evening with the council of the 12 engaged in preparing an epistle to the saints at home & abroad concerning our removal & a general invitation to all honorable law abiding men to ac- company us. The Bishops bought 100,000 ft of pine lumber for the finishing of the Temple & making wagon boxes. Bathsheba sends love to yourself & your kind lady. I wish to be remembered also.

They were all well a short time since  and prospering.  I was at Scenlure, two days  since.  Phebe, those grand old elms are as  grand and majestic as ever.  When do  you think you will see them, and an  respected father.  you may see them, but  probably not him in this world.  Mouther is very poorly is now in N.York under the care of a Physician.  I think a  month or two will determine something  with her.  She must be helped to stand it  much longer.  Our children are well  our friends generally are quite well.  Mary  C.

Rhoda is very  rugged since she recovered from her  severe illness.  Simon is here and in  tends to spend the summer on account  of his health, which is not very good  Ira and family we well.

I am sorry to  say that many of our leading Politicians  of all parties, if possible, are becoming more  corrupt than ever, what the result will  be we cannot tell, the prospect now is  that a dissolution of the Union will  take place before many years, whether that  would be attended with serious consequences  we can hardly tell.

 Washington City June 4, 1856  Mr Wildord Woodruff,  Dear Sir,  Your communications  of the 27th of March and of the 9th of  April were received on the 31st ultimo. Be pleased to accept my thanks for your kindness to my family. I presume you  are apprized ere this that I have paid  Messrs Sanborn & Carter one hundred  and five dollars on your account. It is distressing to hear of the suffering among  our people in consequence of the  scarcity of provisions, and also of the  loss of sheep and stock in consequence  of the severity of the past winter, and  by Indian depredations. The trial through  which the church is now passing is doubt- less the most severe that she has ever  passed through. Those who endure this  chastening of the Lord without 
 apostatising, or murmuring against God,  will probably endure to the end.  I regret to hear that brother Cain is  indisposed.  Will you be good enough  to ask him what disposition he has  made of my oxen and wagon, and  whether he has made any arrangement  to have my family supplied with wood  during the present summer and the  ensuing winter, also whether the two or  three loads of wood due for house  rent have been paid?  This morning I deposited in the post office  a bill of lading and bills of goods which  I trust will reach you in safety. My wagon containing the goods will  start from old winter quarters if it  has not already started.  If you cannot  raise meawhat means my family may need from goods and other sources, you will  draw upon me for what they may 
 require. E. Snow & Co. or perhaps any other  house would I suppose give you the  cash for a small draft payable at one  day after sight.  I am quite disappointed at the course  that Mr. Houtz is pursuing, he has not  done as he agreed to do.  Have the goodness to let me hear from you as often as you can conveniently. Brother Hautz was to kill thirteen hogs in  December last, one fourth of them belonged  to me, and after supplying my family  he was to sell the pork, he was to sell the  remander and hand you the money. If he has not done so, will you please  to endeavor to collect it. Say to him that  my family needs it. Before I left I desired  you to pay brother Houtz some eight  or ten dollars on account of some little  improvements he proposed to make, but  you will pay him nothing more, 
 Washington City, April 7, 1856  Dear Brother,  Inclosed is the receipt of Messrs  Sanborn & Carter for one hundred and  five dollars.  Brother Houtz was to kill thirteen hogs in December, one fourth of which  belonged to me, and the pork of which, after  delivering as much to my family as they  required, he was to dispose of, and pay  the proceeds of the sales to you. Has he  done so? Have you received any flour  from him since you wrote last? Be kind enough to keep me informed how  he gets on with the mill.  The prospects for the speedy admission  of Utah into the Union as a State are dark and gloomy.  Yours in the Gospel John M. Bernhisel  Mr Woodruff.

 [upside-down text]  Geo. A. Smith  [end of upside-down text]  Washington D. C. July 15, 1856  Elder W. Woodruff  I received from you a very welcome and instructing letter for which I return you my thanks. My mission to Wash- ington appears to be a dull affair  Secretary Babbitt left here this morning for Salt Lake. bBy him I have sent letters to President Young My family, yourself and many others I write this to send by mail. Our Know Nothing Congress or rather Black Republican House of Representatives are a regular Blue Law set of fellows, but the House has been occupied ever since I came here with Kansas quarrels and Sumners Caneing evry kind of business seems to be at a stand. The House passed a Bill  to admit Kansas as a Free State on the Constitution framed last winter. They done this for political effect knowing that it could not pass the Senate. The Senate have passed a Bill to authorize Kansas  to form a Constitution fully believing that the House would reject their Bill.  In this manner our statesmen fool away from their time and the real business of the Country rejected; while foolish men  quarrel with each other. 
 Since the Black Republicans and old Tom Benton have been making such a muss about Govr Young and Utah & Poligamy President Pierce has become somewhat Bitter in his feelings at least Dr Bernhisel informs me that the Presidents modest feelings are annoyed with Govr Young's interfeering with the  Juries as set forth inby Bro Brigham in the Tabernacle as set forth in the Tabernacle  Feb 24, 1856 Watts Report of which Mr Pierce has in his possession as published in the 52 No of the 5th Volume ^Deseret News^ page 412 where you will see the President sets forth the rascality of Courts and Lawyers and to make good  his feelings I suppose he has dismissed Joseph L Heywood from Office under the impression probably that he was too honest a man to handle Government funds. He sends Judges to Utah and they make expenses by Tens of thousands of Dollars & these Judges force the Marshal to stand at the Back of these expenses  and the Departments refuse to pay them & cannot conceive how it is possible that anything should cost more in Utah than in N. York. Bro Heywood got his discharge today. I am about appointing him private secretary and he hopes 
 that Uncle Sam will at least be as polite as other men are when they dismiss their hands pay up  Today Dr Bernhisel Introduced me  to Mr Andrew Oliver of N. York. He asked me many questions in relation to Utah & seems pleased. He is a Republican of the moderate stripe. He also introduced me to Govr Aiken member from South Carolina  Also to Mr Cox of Kentucky a Know Nothing  The business of the House is conducted in such noisy style that it is impossible for me to understand half that is going on  In the Senate to day they ^were^ Discussing a Bill for a Road from the South Pass to Minnesota Ter. I was surprised in hearing the debate at the ignorance of ^many of^ the Senators in regard to the mountains & plains.  Judge Kinney called on me yesterday and told Dr Bernhisel & myself  "he had not asked President Pierce to appoint him Govr of Utah. His friends had not asked for him either. He would not permit his friends  to ask. hHe did not want the Office. The office he now had was equally as Lucrative he could remain at home some time and draw his Salary without going to Utah, but if President Pierce tendered him the appointment without  asking he would accept and go to Utah 
 alone without Troops. I can do the duties of Governor in Utah. I want no Troops. I do not want the Office I despise do not want  the Office when I know the whole people prefer Govr Young and I will accept rather as a duty I owe to the people of Utah rather than have a man appointed who would be liable to make trouble. Understand me if Govr Young must be removed and I am tendered the Office I shall acccept. He also stated  that he believed that Govr Young would be removed. I write to you not wishing you to publish my letter because in speaking of men & things Individually they might come back in a way so as to prejudice my influence among the Devils who have all ^got to^ be influenced to vote over ad- mission into Bedlam or we shall have to stay out; and last not least hurt Dr Bernhisel's feelings" I do expect that if we had not have been councelled in the start to confer together and act being agreed that Dr Bernhisels non- committal Policy would have got awfully twisted before this time. The longer I remain here the more thoroughly I became convinced that there  are no independent men in congress who dare stand up for their own principles of non-intervention at the present time or at least that I have not become aquainted with any; I have not met any but what seem to shudder at the idea of facing the music now.

If all the camp of Israel were ^as humble^ as you seem to be your dificulties I am inclined to think would be but few, and they easily settled. for my neglect in writing to you, I hope I shall be forgaven.

 Rexburg Onida Co. Idaho June 6, [18]84  Dear Emma, Clara and all the children  As I find a leasure hour in this far off Northern County I feel to write you a few lines I took car on the 279 May and arrived at Market Lake 2020 Miles from Salt Lake at Midnight in Idaho Br Ricks was ther with a team weating for us We went to bed in the waggon and slept the latter part of the  night we got up in the Morning of the 30 found Horses gone Hunted untill 10 oclok could not find them left 2 boys & one waggon the boys to hu[n]t Horses we took one team & waggon & started for Rexburg 20 Miles we found all the rivers from  Ogden to Idaho full & overflowing the banks we crossed the North fork of Snake River in a fery boat 250 feet wide 26 feet deep 
 we crossed with a wire rope & pullies and when we got across the river it took 2 yoak of oxon to draw our boat with the waggon on for a quarter of a mile th[r]ough a slew before we could get on dry land and the river had overflowed so much it covered our road for 5 miles so we had to travel in the sage brush and rocky lavy beds which was hard travelling & made us quite weary when we got to Br Ricks This new town which is one year old covers 1120 Acres laid out in 10 A[c]re bloks 4 lots in a blok 2 1/2 acres in a lot, most of the lots take up one half of the town fenced & 70 Houses built & two canals dug one 4 miles long & the other 3 1/4 miles and both 10 feet wide on the bottom this Rexburgh town has a field of 1500 acres fenced & 500 acres in wheat today well I never saw so much work done in one year by the same number of people 
 in my life there are 10 other settlements in this stake they number one 1500 people and increasing every day I do not think I ever saw as good a hearding &  farming county as this in these mountians for 30 Miles all around these settlements the Hills and vallies are all covered with grass a foot high. We held Meetings here on Saturday and Sunday and on Monday we travelled 25 Miles East to visit a canyon creek that they thought was good fishing when we got there we found it from 300 to 400 feet deep below the banks in a rugged rocky canyon Neither Broth Grant or myself went down it, it is a range for Antelope Deer Elk & Moose we saw the Deer &  Antelope but No Elk or Moose. We  held a meeting yesterday at Lyman 9 miles south on the Edge of a strip of timber 12 miles long & 2 wide with a large river large heards of Deer stay in the timber

 Terre Haute Sept 27th 1837  Brother Wilford  I received your very kind and interesting Letter dated Rowley Mass. July 25th in its proper season and as you invited my correspondence with you at Scarborough I cannot longer deny myself the pleasure of writing you. In the perusal of the account of your visit among the friends of our youth I assure you I can appreciate the emotions by which you must have been inspired and I should think myself most highly favored to be permitted to enjoy with you such an occasion. When I think of "My own dear native land" So many and such varied associations crowd into my mind that I can hardly determine whether I should realise more pleasure or pain from a visit. I have many objects of attaction and endearing interest there but there is one before which all others lose their force it is found in the magic term "My Sistre"! I have many friends who are very dear to me and upon whose memory I often dwell with great delight, yet my dear brother must forgive me when I say that the presence of my only sister in my thoughts drives every other object from my reccollection. I sometimes fear she is too much the idol of my heart but I pray God that she be not doomed to be smitten in judgment to me. 
 It must have been gratifying to you to meet so much encouragements in your ministry among  the bigotry and superstion of Farmington, and believe me, brother, tho, I am a wayward child I always rejoice at the success of a humble ministration of the gospel and I am proud to think I have a brother who is not ashamed to proclaim the truth where so little honor is to be expected as in one his own country I am not ambitious to have my brothers become "able divines of the day" skilled in all the subtleties of the craft but I shall ever be happy to learn that they are skilful dividers of the word of truth and mighty through God to the pulling down of the strong holds of Satan. I have just received letter from Mother. She writes that the Book of Morman a copy of which I left at home is in much demand there it is loaned out all of the  time and several applications are in advance for the favor. I was very sorry that it became necessary for our people to now return to T... but it was perhaps exp- edient and I hope will prove for the best She writes that all are well and that they are doing as well as they had reason to expect Eunice is expected to go home as soon as her school is closed. 
 You talk of going to Missouri this fall but  say not a word about visiting me! I cannot think dear W. that you can be so unkind as to fail visiting me this fall and I shall insist upon your making Terre Haute a point on your route to Mo. I should be delighted to see you and Sister in Law. And I now promise myself the pleasure before many weeks. I cannot indeed promise you much entertainment here nor do I imagine you be much pleased with me for to tell you the truth I am getting to be a disagreeable thing and do not improve much by age, but then, I am your brother [page torn] and this will be some little excuse for you to take a little trouble to see me, besides I know your weakness and from this knowledge am assured you will take a little pride in presenting me to your Phebe, who cannot be otherwise than what your good taste and judgment warrants me in presuming.  I wrote your at Farmington sometime ago and hope you will get the Letter.  I hope you will write me often.  With kind wishes to Mrs Woodruff I remain , dear brother  Very Truly Yours Asahel H Woodruff  Wilford Woodruff

 copy  Toquerville Washington Co UT May 5 1889  Pres Wilford Woodruff Dear Brother having returned from working in the St George Temple for my Dead I asked Brother McCallister a question that he did not feel at liberty to answer But wished me to state the question to you, just as I had stated it to him, which is a follows I went back to England on a mission in the year 1877 and while there preached the Gosple to my Sister and her family and Baptised several of them, all the rest believing and preached to her the true order of marriage and adoption of her Children her Husband was a drinking man and often acted bad to her so that she would not have him for Eternity but wished to be sealed to me, when she died as she was taken very bad with dropsey and did not Expect Ever to come to Zion. I told her I did not know how that would be. Such things had been done but I did not know how it would be again. Well then if that cannot be done I want you to have me sealed to your son Mohonri M Steele (he was then there on  a mission) and my Children adopted to him and me and left the matter in my hands to see to it She died shortly after I left England and I have had her Endow- ments attended to for her but nothing more Now dear Brother your answer to this question would settle the matter and by so doing would would greatly oblidge your Brother in the Gospel  John Steele

 Sabbath Morning February 23, 1833  Brother  Asahel  I received your line under date of Jan 2nd, & was gratified to learn that you meet with good success in your temporal undertakings. As the business your are employed in appears to prove profitable no doubt but you will do well to persevere in it And I would heartily except of your generous offer in joining you in canvassing two or three of these western counties if circumstances would permit but I stand in need of more information respecting the subject before I can decide. You know Brother it is expensive travling 5 or 6 months without any incomes & now I would like to know who your employers are & whether they reside in York state or Connecticut & how long we must wait for our pay. Was if those who get the subscribers can review pay of the publishers before the Books are distributed I should think it best to get subscribers & let others distribute, but I conclude this is not the case I expect they advance no funds untill the books are distributed & money collected, & if this is the case probably it would be the safest to distribute to your own subscribers then you will be sure of your pay. There is business sufficient for three of us at holm the coming season but perhaps not to that profit that it would be for me to go into the Book business. We have some payments coming due in the spring which probably will take what money we shall have. If I could procure a little money if it was not more than $20.00 I think I would take a [trunk] with you in the Spring which is fast hastening. But at all events I think you will be well to take those Counties you spoke of & if you could get Oswego County I could help you canvass parts of that without much expense, as it is at holm. Whether I have any part as lat in this matter or not I hope the business will continue to prove as favorable to you as it now presents itself And when you receive this line I wish you would write to me again & let me know the whole particulars of the business then I can know better how to calculate. I would like to know who your employers are & if those who get the subscribers must distribute the Books & how long we must wait for our pay &c. I would like to Join you in the business if I can procure money to pay my expenses untill I can receieve sumthing for my labour. I dont think of any thing ^more^ connected with this subject of importance to write.  We have written to Brother Thompson & directed our letter to Farmington stating that we wished him to come out & work with us as soon as he could settle his business in the spring & if you should see him let him know of it as he may have been imployed in some other place through the winter & not receieved it  I shall live in hopes of seeing you in the spring if you visit this section of country  NB (I wish to be remembered to all enquiring friends Willford) 
 I am glad to hear that you are enjoying so comfortable temporal & Spiritual health. With respect to myself I have enjoyed good health through the winter excepting a few turns of the cholic & occasionally a rhoumatic bite but this is not to be wondered at for I should think it would give any man the cholic to load & draw as many logs as I have thi^s^ winter from the shores of Lake Ontario in all kinds of weather however I have got allmost through with it a few days more will if prospered and a winters job. Azmon has been employed most of the week past in sleding lumber to Mexico about six miles which he exchanges for household furniture & farming tools we can exchange lumber for any  kind of store goods But I have allready gone more than a Sabbath days Journey in temporal affairs.  With regard to spiritual things things conserning the Kingdom of God & my own soul I would say it would be impious not to acknowledge the goodness of God in preserving my life to the present period finally what a long suffering & patient waiting God we are dealing with at times when I look at my unfaithfulness, unbelief, slow to obey prone to wander & to do evil, heart buried in the rubbish of the  world while wasteing my Masters goods I feel ready to exclaim what is man that Thou art mindful of as the son of man that Thou visitest him. But I think I have a desire that God will help me to arise & trim my lamp that I may be more prepared for his comeing for he is near even at the door Brother if you have free access to a Throne of grace remember me in your petitions pray that I may know the mind & will of God in Christ Jesus conserning me I have had my mind more than usually impressed for a few days past with the subject of the signs of the times this probably was caused by a visit from a servant or prophet of the Lord which called at our house his commishion is to the house of Israel to warn them to repentance. he professes to belong to no persuasion of people ownly a servent of the living God he goes & comes at the biding of his Master & if he is correct in his prophecy which I cannot doubt (for it agrees with the word of God) we live in the most important event of the world. He says Babylon now is to fall and the cup of Gods indignation is now prepared for her & she must drink it & all who do not come out of her must now fall with her he tells what time we live in & what is now to fall upon the inhabitants of the earth who have not the mark in their foreheads. He allso sayes that the destroying Angels have had their commishion & now gone forth to slay and according to his word great slaughter is nigh at the doors. he appears most like a true prophet of any I ever conversed with My Allmighty God prepare us for evry event & help us to live in such a manner that we may be accounted worthy to escape the Just Judgements of God which are to fall on this generation  From Your Brother W Woodruff 
 ELDERS' JOURNAL OF THE CHURCH OF LATTER DAY SAINTS.  VOL I. No. 1.]- KIRTLAND, OHIO, OCTOBER, 1837. -[Whole No. 1.  North Lat, 44. Long. 69, 10. Vin- alhaven, Fox Islands, Monday, Sept.  18th, 1837.  To JOSEPH SMITH Jr. AND THE CHURCH OF LATTER DAY SAINTS IN KIRTLAND GREETING:  Dear Saints of God,  whom we love of a truth for the truth'  sake that dwelleth in you, and we pray  God that it may abide with you forev- er: As we are called to stand upon  the Islands of the sea, in defence of the  truth and for the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ. We are  under the necessity of making use of  our pen, to give you an account of our  labors in the ministry since we left  Kirkland, as we cannot at present speak  to you face to face. We left Kirtland  May 31st, and took Steamboat at Fair- port in company with Elder Milton  Holmes, to go forth to labor in the  vineyard as the Lord should direct. After calling on the Saints in Jefferson  Co. N. Y. we arrived at Sackett's  Harbour and took Steamboat on the 6th of June for Upper Canada and on the 8th arived at Brother Artemus  Judd's. And on the 10th, had the hap- py privilege of setting in conference  with John E. Page, James Blakes- lee, and a number other elders, and a  large congregation of Saints. And  we were blessed with a very interesting  time. After spending several days  with them we took the parting hand  with these beloved friends and pro- ceeded on our journey for the East in  company with elder John Goodson, and  others bound for England. We took  the parting hand with them at Schenec- tady, and arrived at the Canaan church  in Connecticut, visited the church a  few days. Here elder M. Holmes  took his departure for Mass. and we  went to Colebrook, visited different parts  of the town and held eight meetings,  from thence to Canton and held a meet- ing in the village hall in Collinsville. As we commenced speaking several began to beat their drums at the doors  which made much confusion. This is  the only disturbance we have had since  we left Kirtland. We next visited  Avon, where we held four meetings  and many came out to hear and mani- fest a spirit of inquiry. And elder  Woodruff had the privilege of leading  three of his kinfolk into the waters of  baptism. And had not the Spirit call- ed us away to perform a greater work,  we should have had no difficulty in es- tablishing a branch of the church in  that place. A family where we tarried  but one night, and taught them the  things of the kingdom, believed our tes- timony, and after our departure, two  of the household followed us 15 miles  to receive baptism at our hands, but we  were gone, and they truly believed it  to be a day of warning and not of ma- ny words. We also visited Farming- ton and held one meeting in the Meth- odist meeting house, and preached to  an attentive congregation who wished  to hear more concerning the great work  of God. We left Farmington on the 20  of July, for Mass. and after visiting  the Bradford church, and after preach- ing several times with them, we pro- ceeded on our journey to Saco, Maine,  where we spent several days with the  church and friends. But duty urging  us forward to lift the warning voice to  those that had not heard the sound of  the gospel, we then went to the city of  Portland. We there took the Steam- er Bangor on the 19 of August, to speed  us on our way to the Islands of the sea,  they landed us at Owls head at the set- ting of the sun: But how to get con- veyance to the Islands we knew not,  we retired to a grove and offered up  our thanks unto God for his mercies  and asked him to open our way before  us; we returned to the Inn and soon  found some men that were going near  the Islands that night, they said they  would land us if we chose to take pas- sage with them. We accordingly went  on board, they hoisted sail and landed  us on North Fox Island, Vinalhaven,  at 2 o'clock Sunday morning, August  20th. It was with peculiar feelings  and sensations that we began to walk  forth upon one of the Islands of the sea  which was wrapped in the sable shades  of night, whose waters, had never cov- ered a soul for the remission of their  sins after the order of the gospel, and  which soil had never been press- ed by the foot steps of an elder of Is- rael. We were strangers, pilgrims,  and almost pennyless. But we had 
 TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:  THIS Certifies that Willford Woodruff has been received into the church of the Latter Day Saints, organized on the sixth of April, in the year of our Lord, one thou- sand, eight hundred, and thirty, and has been ordained an elder according to the rules and regulations of said church, and is duly authorized to preach the gospel, agreeably to the authority of that office.  From the satisfactory evidence which we have of his good moral character, and his zeal for the cause of right- eousness, and diligent desire to persuade men to forsake evil and embrace truth, we confidently recommend him to all candid and upright people as a worthy member of society.  We, therefore, in the name, and by the authority of this church, grant unto this our worthy brother in the Lord, this letter of commendation as a proof of our fellowship and esteem: praying for his success and pros- perity in our Redeemer's cause.  Given by the direction of a conference of the elders of said church, assembled in Kirtland, Geauga county, Ohio, the third day of March, in the year of our Lord one thousand, eight hundred, and thirty six.

 come on the Lords business, we believ- ed him faithful that had promised, and  we felt willing to trust in his name,  we soon came to a house, where we  were received and we retired to rest.  We arose in the morning made ourselves  known as servants of the Lord, we in- quired if there was any religion or  priests on the Island; we were inform- ed that there was a Baptist priest, a  small church and a meeting house at  the center of the Island. The town of  Vinalhaven includes both North and  South Fox Islands: Pop. 1800. The  inhabitants are generally wealthy, in- telligent, industrious, generous and  hospitable to strangers. North Island  is 9 miles long, and 2 wide, pop. 800.  South Island is 10 miles long, and 5  wide, pop. 1000 &c. As it was Sab- bath morning there was to be preach- ing in the meeting house, we conclu- ded to attend considering it a proper  place to introduce the gospel. When  we arived at the place, meeting had  commenced, the deacon came to the  door and we informed him that we  were servants of the Lord, that we had  a message for the people and wished  to be heard, the deacon informed the  priest that we were preachers of the  gospel. He invited us into the stand  and gave out an appointment for us at 5 o clock P.M. After the priest had  closed his discourse he invited us to his  house during the intermission. We  presented him the book of Mormon,  he appeared friendly and said he should  like to read it. We met according to  appointment and preached to them the  first principles of the gospel. We then  gave out appointments for the four fol- lowing evenings to be held at the sev- eral school houses on the Island. The  people came out in great numbers and  heard with attention and manifested  much anxiety, and in fourteen days  we held nineteen meetings. The Bap- tist priest became alarmed seeing that  his craft was in danger; and fearing  that if he held his peace all Fox Islands  would believe on our words, accor- dingly he strove to use his influence  against us, but without effect as you  may judge on learning the fact that on  Sunday the 27th while we met with a  congregation, he had not so much as  one to meet with him at his usual place of worship, for the excitement was so  great that the members of his church  and deacon, were attending our meet- ings and inviting us to visit them, and  inquiring into these things. The Lord  clothed us with his Spirit, and we were  enabled to stand up and boldly declare  those things that are commanded us. And the sound thereof soon reached  the neighboring Islands and some of the  inhabitants soon hoisted their sails to  convey them over the waters to hear  the tidings for themselves. On Sun- day the 3rd of Sept. we preached to a  large congregation assembled together  from these Islands, at the close of our  meeting we opened a door for baptism,  and a respectable sea captain and his  wife offered themselves as candidates,  we then assembled where there was  much water and after offering up our  prayers unto God, we then lead them  down into the sea and baptized them  and we returned rejoicing. On Mon- day following we visited the South Is- land to set before them the truths of the  everlasting gospel. We held five  meetings, the people came out by hun- dreds, to hear and filled the school- houses to overflowing.  Notwithstanding the anxiety of the  people to hear more upon this impor- tant subject, yet we were under the  necessity of returning to the North Is- land, to attend an appointment on Sun- day, accordingly we met and preached  to the people and opened a door for  baptism and another sea Captain and a  young lady came forward and we re- paired to the sea shore and baptized  them, and on Tuesday following, we  administered the ordinance of baptism  unto three others.  A Methodist priest on the South Is- land fearing whereunto these things  would grow, came over to the Island  where we were baptizing and made  friends with the Baptist priest (like  Herod and Pilate) and called a meet- ing, we attended [##Luke 23:12##]. The Methodist priest  arose and commenced warm hostilities  against the book of Mormon, and our  principles, we took minutes of his dis- course that we might be correct in an- swering him. As he could not bring  proof from the word of God against  our principles, and in order to make  an impression upon the minds of his  hearers against the work; he took the  book of Mormon in his hand, and with  an out stretched arm declared that he  feared none of the judgments of God  that would come upon him for rejecting  that book as the word of God.

 he closed his meeting we arose and  rectified some of his wide mistakes in  his presence before the congregation,  and informed the people if they would  meet next Sabbath at the meeting  house we would answer every ebjection  that had been presented against the  book of Mormon and our principles du- ring the meeting. And last Sabbath  we met a congregation of several hun- dred at the meeting house, assembled  together from the different Islands, and  we arose in their midst, and redeemed  our pledge by answering every objec- tion that had been brought against the  book of Mormon, or our principles. After meeting we repaired to the water  and again administered the ordinance  of baptism. The Baptist priest is no  less busy than his Methodist brother, for  while one is in the pulpit declaring to  the people, that the principles of the  book of Mormon are saping the very  foundation of our churches and holy  religion; the other is gone over to the  main land calling upon his Baptist  brethren, saying come over and help  us lest we fall. But cursed is man  that trusteth in man or maketh flesh his  arm saith the Lord God. O ye priests  of Baal your cry is in vain, the God of  Israel has set his hand the second time  to recover his people. The stone has  began to roll, and will soon become a  mountain and fill the whole earth. The  Lord is calling his church out of the  wilderness, with her gifts and graces  and restoring her judges as at the first.  God has chosen the weak things of  this world to confound the wise, and  with them he will rend your kingdoms,  that the wisdom of your wise men may  perish, and the understanding of yonr  prudent men may be hid. The cry of  the Saints is ascending into the ears of  the Lord of Sabaoth for Ephraim. The horns of Joseph are begining to  push the people together. The apos- tles of the Lamb of God are bearing the  keys of his kingdom on the shores of  Europe. Yea and the mighty Captains  of the ships at sea, are receiving the  gospel of Jesus Christ; and enjoying  its power, and the call of many from  distant Islands, has already entered  our ears; O come and preach to us,  we have sent a book of Mormon over  the billows of the great deep, to teach  those that are at sea. And the word  and work are propelled by the arm of  JEHOVAH. And the weapon that is  formed against Zion shall soon be  broken. And he that raises his puny  arm against it, is fighting against God  and shall soon mourn because of his  loss. We say these things are true as  God liveth, and the Spirit beareth rec- ord and the record is true, and ven- geance will be speedily executed upon  an evil work in these last days, there- fore, O Babylon thy fall is sure.  Although we have not baptized but  few on these Islands, yet there is hun- dreds believing and many are almost  ready to enter into the kingdom, the  calls are numerous from the neighbor- ing Islands, and also from the main  land, for us to come and preach unto  them, and tell them words whereby  they may be saved from the pending  judgments that await the world. There  are fifteen or twenty neighboring Islands  that are inhabited, some of them con- tain a population of several thousand.  And while the fields are white, we  view the harvest great in this country:  and the laborers few. And while we  are faithfully laboring day and night  for the salvation of his people; we ask  an interest in your prayers, O ye  Saints of the most high God. O ye  elders of Israel will ye not go forth in- to the vineyard and help wind up the  scene of this generation which sits in  darkness and in the shadow of death.   O ye ministers of our God, if we alto- gether hold our peace at this time, shall  we not suffer loss when the Lord raises  up deliverance unto Israel. But for  Zion's sake let us not hold our peace,  and for Jerusalem s sake let us not rest  until the light thereof go forth as bright- ness and salvation as a lamp that burn- eth.  That we all may keep the patience  and faith of the Saints and see that no  man take our crown, is the prayer of  your brethren in the Lord Jesus.  WILLFORD WOODRUFF, JOHNATHAN H. HALE.

 TIMES AND SEASONS. "Truth will prevail." Vol. III. No. 12.]-  CITY OF NAUVOO, ILL. APRIL 15, 1842. -[Whole No. 48.  For the Times and Seasons. SABBATH SCENE IN NAUVOO; March 20th 1842.  A large assembly of Saints gathered together  at the place of meeting at an early hour, to  hear a discourse delivered by President Joseph  Smith, upon the subject of Baptism. A child  of Mr. Windsor P. Lyons being deseased, the  body of which lay before the assembly, called  forth many remarks from the speaker upon the  subject of death and the resurrection, which  were in the highest degree interesting and  edifying, as were also his remarks upon the  subject of baptism.  The following is a brief synopsis of some of  the items delivered by the speaker.  President Smith read the ##Revelations 14|14th chap. of Rev.## and said,  "We have again the warning voice sounded  in our midst which shows the uncertainty of  human life; and in my leisure moments I have  meditated upon the subject, and asked the  question, Why it is that infants, innocent chil- dren are taken away from us? especially those  that seem to be the most intelligent and inter- esting? and the strongest reasons that present  themselves to my mind are these: This world is  a very wicked world; and it is a proverb that  the 'world grows weaker and wiser' if it is  the case, the world grows more wicked and  corrupt. In the early ages of the world, a righte- ous man, and a man of God, and of intelligence,  had a better chance to do good, to be believed and received, than at the present day; but in  these days such a man is much opp[os]ed and  persecuted by most of the inhabitants of the  earth; and he has much sorrow to pass through  here, the Lord takes many away even in in- fancy that they may escape the envy of man, and the sorrows and evils of this present world; they were too pure, too lovely, to live on earth;  therefore if rightly considered instead of  mourning we have reason to rejoice as they  are delivered from evil, and we shall soon have them again.  "What chance is there for infidelity when  we are parting with our friends almost daily? None at all. The infidel will grasp at every  straw for help until death stares him in the  face, and then his infidelity takes its flight, for  the realities of the eternal world are resting  upon him in mighty power; and when every  earthly support and prop fails him, he then  sensibly feels the eternal truths of the immor- tality of the soul. We should take warning  and not wait for the death bed to repent, as  we see the infant taken away by death, so  may the youth and middle aged, as well as  the infant suddenly be called into eternity. Let this then prove as a warning to all, not to  procrastinate repentance, or wait till a death bed; for it is the will of God that man  should repent, and serve him in health, and in the strength, and power of his mind, in order  to secure his blessing; and not wait until he  is called to die. Also the doctrine of Baptiz- ing children, or sprinkling them, or they must  welter in hell is a doctrine not true, not sup- ported in Holy writ, and is not consistent with  the character of God. All children are re- deemed by the blood of Jesus Christ, and the  moment that children leave this world they are  taken to the bosom of Abraham. The only  difference between the old and young dying,  is, one lives longer in heaven, and eternal light  and glory than the other, and is freed a little  sooner from this miserable wicked world. Notwithstanding all this glory, we for a mo- ment lose sight of it, and mourn the loss; but  we do not mourn as those without hope.  "My intention was, to have spoken upon  the subject of baptism, but having a case of  death before us I thought proper to refer to  that subject. I will now however say a few  words upon baptism, as I intended. God has  made certain decrees which are fixed, and  immovable, for instance; God set the sun, the  moon, and the stars in the heavens; and gave  them their laws, conditions, and bounds which  they cannot pass, except by his commandments;  they all move in perfect harmony in their  sphere, and order, and are as lights, wonders,  and signs unto us. The sea also has its bounds  which it cannot pass. God has set many signs  on the earth, as well as in the heavens, for in- stance; the oak of the forest, the fruit of the  tree, the herb of the field; all bear a sign that  seed hath been planted there; for it is a decree  of the Lord that every tree, plant, and herb,  bearing seed, should bring forth of its kind, and  cannot come forth after any other law, or prin- ciple. Upon the same principle do I contend  that baptism is a sign ordained of God, for the  believer in Christ to take upon himself in order  to enter into the kingdom of God, "for except  ye are born of water, and of the spirit ye can- not enter into the kingdom of God," [##John 3:5##] saith the  Saviour. It is a sign, and commandment which 
 God has set for man to enter into his Kingdom. Those who seek to enter in any other way will seek in vain; and God will not receive them, neither will the angels acknowledge their  works as accepted; for they have not obeyed the ordinances, nor attended to the signs  which God ordained for the salvation of man,  to prepare him for; and give him a title to a  celestial glory; and God has decreed that all  who will not obey his voice shall not escape the  damnation of hell. What is the damnation of  hell? to go with that society who have not  obeyed his commands. Baptism is a sign to  God, to Angels, and to heaven that we do the  will of God: and there is no other way beneath  the heavens whereby God hath ordained for  man to come to him, to be saved, and enter into  the kingdom of God, except faith in Jesus  Christ; repentance, and baptism for the remis- sion of sins, and any other course is in vain; then you have the promise of the gift of the  Holy Ghost. What is the sign of the healing  of the sick? the laying on of hands is the sign,  or way marked out by James; and the custom  of the ancient Saints as ordered by the Lord;  and we can not obtain the blessing by pur- suing any other course, except the way marked  out by the Lord.  What if we should attempt to get the gift of  the Holy Ghost through any other means, ex- cept the signs, or way which God hath ap- pointed? should we obtain it? certainly not;  all other means would fail. The Lord says do  so, and so, and I will bless, so, and so.  There are certain key-words, and signs belong- ing to the priesthood, which must be observed  in order to obtain the blessing, the sign of  Peter was to repent, and be baptized for the  remission of sins, with the promise of the gift  of the Holy Ghost: and in no other way is the gift of the Holy Ghost obtained. There is a  difference between the Holy Ghost, and the  gift of the Holy Ghost. Cornelius received the  Holy Ghost before he was baptized; which  was the convincing power of God unto him of the truth of the gospel; but he could not receive the gift of the Holy Ghost until after he was baptized. Had he not taken this sign, or or- dinance upon him, the Holy Ghost which con- vinced him of the truth of God, would have  left him. Until he obeyed these ordinances  and received the gift of the Holy Ghost, by  the laying on of hands, according to the order  of God, he could not have healed the sick, or  commanded an evil spirit to come out of a man, and it obey him; for the spirits might say unto  him, as they did to the sons of Sceva; 'Paul  we know; and Jesus we know, but who are  ye!' [##Acts 19:15##] It mattereth not whether we live long or  short on the earth after we come to a knowl- edge of these principles and obey them unto the  end. I know that all men will be damned if  they do not come in the way which he hath  opened; and this is the way marked out by the  word of the Lord.  "As concerning the resurrection I will mere- ly say that all men will come from the grave as  they lie down, whether old or young, there will  not be 'added unto their stature one cubit;' neither taken from it; all will be raised by  the power of God, having spirit in their bodies,  and not blood. Children will be enthroned in  the presence of God, and the Lamb; with bodies  of the same stature that they had on earth; hav- ing been redeemed by the blood of the Lamb, they will there enjoy the fulness of that light glory, and intelligence which is prepared in the Celestial kingdom: 'Blessed are the dead  who die in the Lord; for they rest from their  labors and their works do follow them.' [##Revelations 14:13##]  The speaker before closing called upon the  assembly before him, to humble themselves in  faith before God, and in mighty prayer and  fasting to call upon the name of the Lord, until the elements were purified over our heads, and the earth sanctified under our feet; that  the inhabitants of this city may escape the power  of disease and pestilence, and the destroyer that  rideth upon the face of the earth; and that the  Holy Spirit of God may rest upon this vast  multitude. At the close of the meeting Presi- dent Smith informed the congregation that he should attend to the ordinance of Baptism in  the river near his house, at 2 o'clock; and at  the appointed hour the bank of the Mississippi  was lined with a multitude of people, and Pres- ident Joseph Smith went forth into the river  and baptized with his own hands 80 persons,  for the remission of their sins; and what added  joy to the scene was, that the first person bap- tized was Mr. L. D. Wasson, a nephew of  Mrs Emma Smith; the first of her kindred  that have embraced the fulness of the Gospel. At the close of this interesting scene the ad- ministrator lifted up his hands towards heaven, and implored the blessing of God to rest upon  the people; and truly the spirit of God did rest upon the multitude, to the joy and consolation  of our hearts. After baptism the congregation  again repaired to the grove, near the Temple, to attend to the ordinance of confirmation;  and, notwithstanding, President Smith had spoken in the open air to the people, and stood  in the water and baptized about 80 persons,  about 50 of those baptized received their con- firmation under his hands, in the after part of 
 Farmington Nov 28 1845  Dear Son Wilford  It is now Thanksgiving eve with us, & we have been waiting in earnest expectation for a number of weeks to hear from you again. I should have written you eer this, had it  not been for the consequent ersults of the late trouble at the west zvivz  the determinations of the church to remove to a more hospitable clime &c &c, & as we your Parents verily supposed, their son Wilford would never engage in this great enterprize without first visiting ^his native^ land because firstly, they were conscious that he not only had children in his native Land but also some property there which they concluded he must of necessity attend to before he left these united States, & secondly that he had Parents there who had for some time past been looking to him as one who, in some not very distand  period would probably be able & willing to assist them in gathering with the Saints & their other dear children who had gone thither & whom they much wished to see, & that now as the church had determined upon a remove across the Rocky Mountains to California surely they thought it could not be long before he would be returning to the West & make calculations to call on them to stir them up & assist them in preparing for the great event viz to aid them on to the West & give them a little time to rest & visit their Children untill the opening of the spring when they wocould all both Parents & Children be prepared to take their final leave with the church & in the strength of Israels God engag in the Rocky Mou scaling the flinty Mountains I thought soon after we had the account that the church would all remove, & told your father, that I would write as it was high time we had, but that it was not certain but that you might have had the news sooner, as soon a[s] we & that you might be returning before a Letter could get to you & knowing your zeal in things pertaining to the Kingdom of God we finally thot best to omit writing you, your father had often said I wonder Wilford dont write us or, that we do not recieve a communication from him, if he is coming on this fall & this, we surely thot you would do & when your father said, I dont know how W. will be visit for the means to assist us in going the answer was at hand, viz that I thought & felt that as he had from time to time assisted the Saints especially when in England to come to America that that they might go to the Land of Zion & that now, as he would in all probability desire to help his Parents & other relatives to go with the church that the Lord wold open & prepare the way before him by granting him means sufficient to accomplish the desired object. Indeed your father & myself have fell much on the subject I can say that it has looked very pleasent to me to think of going even across the Rocky Mountains 
 Indeed I have had a great choice in view of going by Land & your Father said, before the trouble at the west after reading a descripti- on of California that there was no place in the world where he should like to go as well as to California but, enough of this strain  We have rec'd a Letter from our Children at Nauvoo, to day, & it was the first we have had since their trouble, & it was with a trembling hand, that I broke the seal, yet we learned therefrom that they were all in the Land of the living, & in somewhat comfortable circumstance, yet the contents of the  same were such in general as to sicken our hearts & give us the worst of feelings but what, you will ask, did it contain. Why, in the first place our children spoke of the removal of the church as tho they had no part nor lot in the matter, & principily because they had no means to assist themselves to go & no information that anyone would lend a helping hand to assist them, there is something Wilford that looks quite dark to us in this affair & there seems to be a good deal of it too if we can judge anything from their communication & here arises a question in our hearts which seems at this time hard to be solved viz, can these things be of God, but now Wilford you will say, Mother I must be crazy, but I can tell you Son W. that for near thirty years your Mothers mind, or the exercises of the same have in almost every instance where any thing of a serious nature was about to transpire have proved to ^be^ as a preface to the final result & now I now not how to understand the excercises of mind I have had of late, when contrasted with present appear- ances, our Children write that you have been counciled to go Direct from England to California. If a thunbolt had racked our house I should not have been more astounded than upon reading this declaration. I have ever believed since I became aquainted with spiritual things that the work of the Lord never clashed, but here is something that looks so much like it, that I am filled with wonder & astonishment, now I would ask one question or two, has not President Young been made aquainted with the fact, that you had Parents who were in the decline of life, & [w]ho of course looked to you as their all as it were especially as to the privige of gathering with the Saints & that altho they have other sons who would gladly receive their society & do all that lay that lay in their power to render them every necessary assistance but that  after all, the moment they should  go to dwell with or near by their  sons they would be constrained to give up their religion or the principles of the Gospel unless they should conclude to live in one continual conflict as have the Saints in Illinois I say has Presid- dent Young been made aquainted with these facts as also that you have an only Sister residing in Nauvoo, who has for a number of  years past been in a very peculiarly afflicted state not only in reg- ard to her own health but also on the account of the misfortunes of her companion in life, & consequently would stand in special need of some little assistance from her Brother in such an import- ant crisis as the present but if this has not been the case It does appear 
 to me that he ought to be informed forthwith. I am of the opinion that there could not probably be found one in the whole church who volunteering to emigrate with the Saints in England would subjugate so great a number to the heartrending trials which must necessarly ensue upon your departure frome the Isle of Great Brition to the Territory of California. We have as a family in former years seemed to be marked out as it were with special blessings from the hand of God, but in the present case it seems that we are like like to be marked out (either by the hand of God, or that of Man for special disappointment. I have never expe- rienced any thing that looked to me so unreconcileable as the councili- ng you to start from England for it does seem to me that reason & discretion as well as the gospel principles of the Gospel would lead to having a case for natural friends in such an immergency for if such friends do ^not^ manifest a case who will. It appears that Eunice & Webster have not had the information as to ^the^ Saints removal that your father & myself have  had viz the article written by Mr Hastings on the advantages of emigration to California the account of the richness of fertility of the soil the spontane- ous productions of the same, the arrangements & rules laid down for the Journeying thither &c &c or I am sure they would have exspressed themselves differently on the subject, they say that the church had determined on removing not really beyound the bounds of time & space but to a place where they can have a little more space & also peace, that they were in fact going into the wilderness probably far beyond the Rocky Mountains the Identical spot they do not know that the spirit of persecution had become so strong that the church could stay the[re] [no] longer, but, (they add) if they do not see such a time of hardships, privations & dangers in this undertaking that they have never before experienced, they shall be much mistaken as they can have nothing to subsist upon but what they take along with them, that the rich in Nauvoo, had covenanted together to assist their poor to go after preparing themselves, but as ^for^ its being a possible thing for them to help their poor near all away, it could not possibly be done, that they had that. Wilford would come that way & bring us along, as it would be the last opportunity we should have of gathering with the Saints, that as to themselves they could make no calculation about the Journey, as they had nothing to calculate with but E. says I would not like to miss of going with the church, &c &c, for my part after perusing the the accounts of California it looked to me that it would be altogethe better for the Church if they could get there & as to the journey there has been nothing in that which looked dark if performed, & arranged according to the directions of Mr Hastings but has looked pleasantly to me, & I believe also to your father but I have but a short time since written to Cousen Betsey encouraging her in the belief that that they would in all probability have an opportunity of going with the church & that I had every reason so to do, as I had read over & over that it was the intention to take all the Saints, & surely I thought our family connection would stand a good a chance as any others, & we could probably each family of us raise somewhat towards the exspences & that by having your assistance we might be prepared or even if there should be a little wanting we might obtain that from the church or some other way I have felt as tho should your father lay the matter before some of our neighbors he might probably get some assistance 
 [sideways text] Why Son Wilford what a predicament your Parents & their friends would be in suppose you should actually go as we have had intimation. I cannot think, it will be so, if for no other reason than this, that your Parents could never again say, that they had not been conf- ounded while endeavouring to trust in the Lord god of Israel, & the scriptures tell us that such shall never be confounded in worlds without end, now I do not suppose that if indeed President Young has given such council to you that it proves that he is not ordinarly possessed of as much wisdom as any ^other^ person on the earth, but rather his having so much business to attend to did not think to [end of sideways text]  enquire whether you had ^not^ Parents & other friends whom it would be your duty to see to on this important occasion, but the special predicament I illerded to would be this, that we your Parents  would not either be with the church nor get to our children at Nauvoo, nor they to us, because they would not be able to do of themselves alone. It does actually seem the most strange thing in the world that since you are the only Male member in our family who has any connection with this church that the minds of the  Twelve have ^not^ had a consciouslyness of the responsibility is resting upon you in regard to your somewhat numerous frie- nds for Indeed had your Father a suf- ficent supply of means to help us on the journey still, you know we should  need your aid, & as you are so well acq- uainted with travelling, & your father so little, but I have filled my sheet you see & some over. I will say, that we [reed  1 or his] Letters from you the sumer past & very much prized the contents of the same We shall hope to hear from again soon.

 Terre Haute Dec 10th 1837  Dear brother  You enquire in your last whether I get the "Latter Dayy Saints" from Kirtland. I do and am obliged for the favor but to whom I am indebted I do not know unless yourself I have read some of the com- munications in the "Elders Journal" with a good deal of  interest but I must have leave to say that I do not  admire the style and spirit of the Letter from England particularly that part which related to the pious devotion of brother Kemball to his wife and children and Jesus Christ. I do not perceive any necessary connection in idea between the crucifixion of JOur Savior and the welfare of ones wife and children and why the latter clause was added I cannot conceive unless to prevent the jealousy of his wife.  It is very seldom that I get Letters from home the latest however render accounts of good health and general prosperity I believe the situation of our family in Farmington is more agreeable than before the sojourn in Colebrook. Mother and Eunice express their satisfaction with the advantages of good society which they enjoy and I immagine they improve it better than they formerly did. They write that they receive every desireable attention.  You will recollect that I was interrupted in my last, in the pursuit of an interesting subject, by an "inexpressible" but I am happy to assure you that no harm was done or  other effect produced than the Excitement of a few  sensations which soon wore off leaving me cool and calm. But to return I was speaking of the confusion 
 produced in my mind by your mention of the change in Sister Eunice. If she was not our only sister or if I was less sensitive or less susceptible of the warmer sensibilities of human nature I should probably never have occasion to allude to my sister in refference to any change in me. There is indeed a change in me since you saw me but in some respects it is not such a change as you  would naturally expect to find. In that particular  respect in which I have not advanced to that state ^tone^ of  character which you would expect and to which I shall refer you. I trace the cause to my deep defvotion to my sister the interest I have feellt in her and my great ansxiety for her. Instead of an advance with my years to the deportment of manhood and to the pursuits and tastes of ripen years I am more childish in feeling and deportment than when you saw me last. It appears to me that trifles which would be objects of desire at the age of twelve afford me as much gratification as at that period of my life and in the choice of companions I am never so well pleased as in the company of boys and girls.  In selecting my female associates I hardly ever choose those over 12 or 14 years for past that age they are in my estimation past the age of lovliness perfect loveliness. And to think of paying my court to a young Lady within 3 or 4 years of my own age would seem an absurdity which I could scarcely surmount. If I have a coat at the Tailors it is as much an object of desire with me to see it completed as with a boy to get a new Hat. And  [sideways text] I have not demonstrated very clearly my premises, that my character [end of sideways text] 
 when any new tho, unimportant arrangement is  accomplished in my business I am as much elated as is the same boy when he gets permission to spend a week at his uncles in the city. And if a girl of 13 does not return my tenderness (meekness?) my passions rage like a burning volcano. The reason of all which I believe may be found in my ardent devotion to my sister. If for the last five years I have had a desire to live to prosper to acquire reputation wealth and respectability the exciting impulse has been my regard for her. I have lived for her I have toiled for her and for her only have I struggled against the adversities of fortune that she might be blessed that in me she might find succour and support. She has dwelt continually in my mind has occupied my first thoughts and when in my happier moments I have thought myself blessed this cloud that has soonest spread over my joy has been the reflection that she could not share with me my happiness  The image of my sister which has so often been pictured to my imagination has been that of the girl of 13 which that I left at my fathers house I have never been able to fancy her in any other character than that of the little girl I used to lead about by the hand. I have loved her as such and it is to that image that in the fervor of my  [sideways text] I have not demonstrated very clearly my premises, that my character has been affected by my sister I have however given you the principle upon which I account for the phenomena of my mind and your reasoning faculties will supply the deficiency Upon the principal of the association of ideas Shand the effect thereby produced I think you will be able to find a solution of the problem untill ten or twelve days ago the weather has been as mild and  pleasant as May in New England since that time the weather has been variable cold and wet &c I suppose you have  winter in all its variety long before this time  I hope you will continue to write to me I shall be interested in any account you may give of your spiritual and temporal concerns of the county character habits and pursuits of the in habitants weather &c Etc  Please make my Love acceptable to Mrs Woodruff.

 Terre Haute July 22 1837  Brother Wilford.  I received witH pleasure your letter dated Farmington 7th Inst and read it over and over with much satisfaction. I am much interested in the account of your visit among our common friends and I know not that anything could afford me higher pleasure than to participate with you in the joy of such an occasion. It has been our lot to be seperated for a long time and under circumstances rather unusual. Yet it does not appear to me that there can be any reason to apprehend that the kindred ties that which unite us have in any degree loosened their bond. We are still brothers  and friends and while we have a sister a mother and a common father around whom to rally the purer sentiments of our hearts, have we not a mutual pledge of Enduring affection of brotherly love? I am aware that the correspondence that has passed between us since we parted has not been of a character to evidence the highest degree of brotherly regard for we have been perplexed with the cares and anxieties of life and by the mysterious phenomena of mind have been widely seperated in our views hence it is not strange that our intercourse has been interrupted. But we do not look to the regular and uniform interchange of written communication for a pledge of each other's affection we have this assurance in the nature of our relations and in our capacity to appreciate Each others claim.  You intimate the apprehension that your letters have not interested me you are mistaken I have ever read your  letters with satisfaction and have only at times wished that they contained a more particular account of your personal affairs, being more interested in them than in the great "common cause". 
 With regard to "Mormonism" I suppose we do not differ much about its peculiar doctrines. In the application of the principles of these doctrines, however I imagine I shall not for some time be able to see the propriety of the course pursued by Mormons. I do not indeed believe that the prominent doctrines of the sect are peculiar to "Mormonism proper". These doctrines have been maintained ever since the gospel was preached by a large number of every sect and I have yet to be satisfied that these popular doctrines were not introduced into the Mormon Economy in an arbitrary manner to decare the influence and favor of that respectable portion of community.  So it respects the inspiration of the "Book of Mormon" and of "Mr Smith" (the prophet) or indeed any of the  pretensions of the "Saints" of which I am informed I do not think them unreasonable. I do not know but they ^are^ in perfect accordance with the revelation of the doctrine of Jesus Christ as presented to us in the Bible but I have yet to be convinced that they are more than empty pretensions. Every prominent doctrine of Mormonism may true be true, while the leaders of the sect, those indeed who assume to them- selves the high prerogation of teachers from God to man may be rotten in heart, corrupt in life and ignorant of the first principle of holy religion These are some of my views. I entertain a dear respect for the cause and tho I have sometimes spoke lightly of it as in some of my letters to my friends it has not been with the intention to ridicule, but rather to gratify my propensity to amuse myself at the expense of others. 
 You see I employ the term "Mormon" when refering to your church. I do this respectfully and only because it is the most convenient term I can find. And I can discover no impropriety in it for other sects on designated by some popular term and it would be nonsense for "Latter Day Saints" to deny that they are a sect for ^they are^ as thoroughly identified with sectarianism as other churches.  I hope you will write to me again soon and may I not expect the pleasure of seeing you here in the course of the fall. I think you would do well to visit this part of the "Vineyard" and which perhaps you ^will^ think all- most equal to Zion. This is a beautifull country but sin stalks abroad in the land and blights her fa[page torn] charms.

 Terre Haute July 22nd 1838.  Sunday A. M.  Ever dear brother.  I have now before me three unanswered letters from you having dates, "Vinal Haven March 10th" "Scarborough May 2thnd" and Farmington  June 26th 1838. From one so prone to complain of the neglect of correspondents as I am, such delinquency as this comes with a bad grace, and I would offer an apology for an excuse, but then I hate excuses, and so will substitute an expl- anation. I have not been inattentive to your letters nor have I lacked a feeling of deep interest in them, but I have so weighed them. And have so felt the importance of the subject which has generally and mainly employed your pen that I have des- ired to return appropriate answers. And hence have delayed from day to day and from week to week for time to do justice to your favors untill so much matter  has accumulated upon which I should be pleased to communicate my reflections that I fear my pen recoils as I now attempt to direct it. I have been so kindly disposed towards you as to pass the "firm resolve" to answer your every letter, and to give you line for line and thought for thought nay morey I have laid other plans for your entertainment and perhaps amusement. I have designed giving you such details of "the way the world has gone with me" since I parted with you at [Richland], that you would be enabled to see before you as "large as life" your little brother, and comprehend the object of his existence but I have deferred the matter untill  I should have "a more convenient season" and so time which waiteth for no man has imperceptibly glided away while I have not discharged ^even^ the immediate duties of brother to brother much less have I accomplished thou high designs  which I had conceived for your gratification as the unaffected offerings of friend to friend. And this is but the history of my whole concern  fromFrom my earliest life I have been continually laying plans for future ("greatness", shall I say?) nay whatever may have been my frailties and foibles  I have not had ^added^ the folly of aspiring to greatness., my plans have been of future goodness and usefulness. In early life I became enamoured of the charms of virtue, and the aspirations of my heart were after goodness and truth  my ambition led me to aspirey high indeed but after humility and meekness and it was in the lowliness of my mind that at a very tender age I well remem- ber feeling the kindlings of a virtuous pride in anticipations of future goodness and usefulness. But ah! how sadly have my well formed but ill timed plans been frustrated The accursed spirit of procrastination has been the canker worm of my degradation, What has been to me the duty of to day has been made the business of to morrow. And to morrow has not come!!  I am aware that it is common place confession to speak of one's misimproved time,  And to acknowledge the sin and folly of procrastination is but a modest way of intimating that we are not righteous over much but brother it is the history  of scenes of no common folly and neglect that I here divulge and if you could perceive as I feel the sickly barrenness of my mind and the polluted sinfulness  of my heart and could be persuaded as I am that it is all the result of putting off untill to morrow the business of to day you would indeed [groan] at my calamity. It is a fact that in relation to the acquisition of knowledge from books and from observation, to the cultivation of my mind by the  proper exercise of my intellect, to the encouragement of virtuous disposition  in my heart and the inclination to become good and win, as well as in relation to the management of pecuniary matters and all things appertaining to my life and the various relations I have procrastinated every thing but my folly. 
 In your letter of March 10th you very kindly utter the wish that you could "commune with some "Heavenly Messenger" and give vent before him to your feelings concerning tho to whom you are bound by the ties or consanguinity" That you are often present in the spirit with thou with whom you are bound by the ties of nature I have no doubt and it is a source of much satisfaction to me to believe that I enjoy a liberal share of your regard that I do not deserve much of your consideration is a reflection ungrateful indeed to me but nevertheless quite true unless my appreciation of your worth and a tender regard for you as a brother and friend entitles me to a corresponding degree of your regard. I have felt a good deal of interest in the accounts you give of your travels in the ministry more particularly per- haps because it is a matter which concerns your welfare though I per am unwilling to admit that I do not feel a good deal of interest also in the progress the work in which you are so successfully engaged. I have followed you to the far west to the field of contest and there my apprehensions were excited for you as well as account of your exposure to the evil designs of the world as to the contagious malady which prevailed to so alarming and degree. My excitement was of a feverish character. I feared that the hand of the violent man would fall upon you that the abuses of the vulgar and the coarse minded would be heaped upon your head as upon the head of an outlaw and a ruffian, and that no voice would be heard in your defense declaring that you were innocent of any evil designs upon the peace of comm- unity. Then the work came as on the wings of the wind that a deadly contagion had visited your camp and that scores had already fallen before you and could I rest and be at peace while my brother stood exposed to the shafts of death! But another word came which told of the breaking up of your bandy of its disperson to East and to the South to the North and to the West and you were placed before me a wanderer over the fair of the Earth in the capacity of a preacher of doctrines which were a by- word and a proverb among men. I already fancied I saw you exposed to the ridicule and the scoffs of bigots, hypocrites unbelievers wicked men and devils and was pained at indignities and insults which I imagined were being heaped upon you and I had not even the consolation of knowing that you were engaged in the cause of God (for then indeed I could have endured to  see you suffer persecution, under the full persuasion that you would be blessed and honored by the King of Saints) though I did not doubt that you believed you were doing right and that you bore along with ^you^ a clear conscience and an honest heart. Many long months passed away and I heard not a word respecting you   what might have befallen you I was in doubts andbut I felt a fearful apprehension that you something ill had befallen you. An angry insurrection had been plotted and was discovered just upon the eve of its breaking out the people of the South were inflamed and their vengeance was visited upon many innocent and unsuspecting persons, there  was no liberty of speech there and a person had only to be suspected of entertaining sentiments appored to some of the institutions of the South to be visited with all the horrors of a hellish anarchy. Under these circum- stances my emmotions were such as I cannot well ^express^ my fears were of the gloomist character for I knew your enthusiasm and your determination to maintain your priviledges rights as an American citisen perhaps in your sentiments you were appored to the institution of slavery and in the fear of God you would be constrained to raise your voice against it, a course which would have brought upon you swift destruction from the presence of  men and my forebodings were bitter indeed. If I had any hope for your safety it was in the kind care of providence I had no confidence in the protection which would be afforded you in the plea that you 
 were a free citizen of this republic during that dark "reign of terror". But I was permitted once more to hail your return to your friends, and to rejoice in the triumph you had thus gained over the enemy and had the happiness once more to peruse the lines dictated by your brotherly kindness. I saw you engage in preparing yourself for the more efficient discharge of your duties as a minister of grace and among your fellows I imagined you giving and receiving counsel in relation to matters app- ertaining to the interests of "the Church" I saw you taking upon yourself the flowery yoke of matrimony and, (believe me) I rejoiced in the consideration that in subm- itting your neck to the yoke you had found a true yoke-fellow in whom you might not only find an assistant bearer of your burdens and sharer of your sorrows and joys but also an agreeable companion who should sweeten the sorrows of your life, and heighten the enjoyments of your happier hours by her cheerful smile and devoted love. I saw you bending your way to the far East to enter a new field, even to speak the word to the "Islands of the Sea". I followed you in your journeyings and saw you commence your labors upon the Islands rejoice in your sucess prayed for your comfort and safety lamented the bigotry and intolerance you encountered, and left ashamed with you that men, nay that those who present themselves to the world as ambassadors from the Court of Heaven,  should so far depart from the principles of spirit of enlightened, liberal, & republican principles (to say nothing of the principles of the religion they profess) as did thou preachers and Elders who so ungenerously opposed you. Fools that they are! to believe in a God and to worship him in the forms of his religion and at the same time to have so little confidence in His cause as to fear and quake lest a handful of "Mormons" should upturn there it root and branch! I followed you on your return to the main land and accompanied you again to the land of your birth, was with you in spirit aroundat a fathers house and did not envy you the paternal affection and maternal tenderness which you there enjoyed and in the fulness of a brothers heart I did not forget to yield to you the entire devotion of a sisters heart. It was indeed a priviledge which you enjoyed to spend so pleasant a season at home and I should have been happy [therin] happy to have made one in the family circle on that occasion. But how  soon I shall enjoy that pleasure with you or whether such happiness is in reserve for me at all is a subject I do not like to reflect upon. But I have not forgotten that previous to your last visit at home you went to New York that you then met with your bre[thren] from Europe and heard from them of the progress of the "work" in a foreign land. I went up the North River with you and across the hills and dales to Connecticut. Conjured up all the  familiar faces in Avon, Lovely street cider brooks &c &c and brought them up to hear the mormon preacher, and [have] several times gone down with you to the solumn waters of baptism. All them and many other picturesscenes have I frequently imagined myself a witness of and this hasty and imperfect outline so imperfectly drawn (in my haste) has afforded the subject of many a picture which I have dwelt upon with much interest drawing so largely upon my imagination it would be expected that many of the scenes which I should represent to myself would be mere fancy sketches and I presume that in following your amid the diver- sified scenes of the last few years of your life I have often followed you at a great distance and sometimes perhaps have mistook^aken^ your way. That I have not fully ^properly^ appreciated the spirit by which your steps have been directed I think is more than probable for indeed I am incompetent to judge with regard to the character of the cause in which you have been engaged I have ^having^ never been able to avail myself of such information as would enable me to form adequate ideas of the origin character and tendency of Mormonism. 
 Brother, I have repeated to you that I feel interested in the question of Mormonism I again repeat that I am deeply so. There then no other reason than that I have a brother who is identified with the leaders of the Society this would be sufficient ground for any interest which I may feel. But when to there is added the consideration that my father my mother and my only sister as well as many other friends are under its influence and are liable to become members of the society it becomes doubly my interest and duty to enquire if the doctrine be true. If Mormonism is the work of God and the peculiarities of Mormonism are founded in Eternal Truth I desire to know it. If it is true then my highest interest and the highest interest and the highest interest of my friends is involved in our embracing it with all its terms. If it is untrue or if in other terms Mormonism proper and peculiar is not founded inupon direct revelation from Heaven God forbid that one of us should be under its influence another day. That the prominent doctrines of Mormonism are in general correct and are even more reasonable than perhaps ^those of^ any other sects I am ready enough to believe but then their doctrines may all be true founded upon correct principles and yet Joseph Smith Jr may be as arrant [as known] and as great an impostor as ever lived. if this is the case we can renounce Mormonism and at the same time retain every  correct principle and doctrine which it embodies. But I must [close] I will only now add that I am bound to believe Joseph Smith Jr and all the leaders of your society honest men untill it is disproved. Yet I have no proof of the truth of their pretensions except the admission you have made and they are not satisfactory to me not being as explicit as I could wish. I shall probably trouble you with some questions regarding this subject before long and shall hold you responsible for the result of the same by virtue of the interest which we mutually have in an only sister who is inclined to become a member of the Church of the Latter Days Saints. Hold yourself ready and peradventure you may make a believer of me and to God shall be all the glory.

 Terre Haute Nov 24th 1837  Dear brother  Your letter dated Vinal haven. Oct 20th is before me and has been perused over and over with much satisfaction I thank you sincerely for this token of your regard, and am the more gratified with the favor from the indications which it manifests that you desire my correspondence. In responding to your wishes in this respect permit me to assure you I anticipate great pleasure.  I believe that a well regulated correspondence may be both interesting and profitable and, situated as we are I can perceive no reason why we should decline its advantages. And indeed when we consider the relation we sustain to each other what reason can we find to justify such neglect? An unreserved correspondence with you has for a long time been an object of desire with me. I embrace then thwith pleasure the priviledge (which I think the Spirit of your letter warrants me in inferring you will grant) and hope I shall hereafter be permitted to consider you a regular correspondent. I hope you will write me often, and without regard to order in refference to my answers for we are both so situated that we cannot at all times observe regularity in our communication We must write, then, whenever we are in the "mood" trusting to circumstances for matter.  There is much in your letter I should like to nanswer, but must content myself with noticing a part only. Could a brothers heart find any thing more prominent in your letter than that which relates to his only sister? You strike a tender chord when you allude to this object of my first regard and when you speak of the change, time has wrought in her you bewilder my brain you excite within me a struggle between my imagination and my judgment, which shows me too plainly my weakness Confound it!! will you believe that just as I ^was^ expressing the last sentence a pretty faced girl of 14 years, of "undoubled character" who is in the habit of visiting every body came plump in upon ^me^ and took her seat close by me poking her head right into my face, exciting pretty sensations? to mix with those ^sentiments^ I was just indulging in. It would be a sin to resume the sacred subject. So while the fair one (?) is looking at the picture books I will only nadd that sister is at home in Farmington, attending the Academy, that  I long to see her and if I don't forget where I left off I will resume to the sentimental again, and render the passage complete and the idea intelligible. 
 Next in turn as connected with the subject I was so unfortunately interrupted in pursuing, would come the change in me, but here I am at total loss, the matter being so completely involved in the former subject that I could not discuss it except in connection so you will please have the goodness to wait unttill untill I take up the former again when I promise to present the latter free from obscurity. But lest you should by some strange vaguary get the notion that I am ^in^ the way to be a great man I will here promise that you will be sadly disappointed when you are informed with regard to my character. I honestly fear I shall never meet the expectations of those of my friends whose anticipations were the most moderate, much less those whose partiality led them to suppose me a clever fellow.  You enquire whether I have "any intelligence from brother Azmon and family or Thompson" I presume I know nothing of them that you did not learn at home, for the last I heard from them was in a letter from home before you visited. Neither of them have written to me except Azmon wrote one letter perhaps eighteen months ago God bless them! if He don't I really don't know who will have an opportunity to do so soon.  You also enquire about my business and when I think of going  East, to the latter I reply I have been thinking of going East next "two months" for the last two and half years, when I shall so digest my thoughts as to be able to reduce them to practice I do not know, probably, however next Spring Business has been generally (as you will anticipate) dull the last season throughout this part of the country, for  reasons which all intelligent persons are acquainted with it is however improving and the prospect for next year is fair. Produce will be 75 ^5025 or 30^ pr ct lower this winter than last, which will in fact be nearer the real value than former prices.  Our business I mean the business of Woodruff & Smith has been as good as we anticipated, and is increasing The amount of our sales of Books & Stationery for the first year ending in September last was (over) 
 between Eleven and twelve thousand dollars, this and when it is considered that we have done this without capital and under the disadvantages incidental to the establishment of a new house and have been able to meet all our engagagements unassisted we challenge any establishment in the West to produce a better result of first years opperations. If we have not profited directly, I have not doubt we have established a character for business which is worth the trouble we have been at to acquire.  I am much interested in the amount of your success in the ministry and I hope continual success commensurate with your talents and application will be the reward of your labors. I thank you for the information you give respecting that section of country Such intillegence will be always grateful to a mind which desires knowledge. Mr Smith my partner was in Illinois not long since he saw one of the Derrings from Avon. Mr Derring mentioned you to him, told him that he heard you preach in South Canton and what was more silly than all added h that you were [page torn] [the worst] Preacher" he ever heard. I dont believe a wo[rd] [o]f it  I am anxious to know something more particular about Sister Eunice, will you be good enough to tell me undisguisedly what you think of her. I shall expect a minute description of her personal appearance and of the capacity of her mind. Excuse this weakness. [2 illegible words] pleasure with Mrs the [illegible]  I shall be grateful if you will so present my respects to Mrs Woodruff as to ensure their acceptance and you may present me to all who are interested to enquire after me  Your brother Asahel H Woodruff  Willford Woodruff

 Terre Haute Sept 9th 1838  Dear brother  I received yours of 25 ulto yesterday P. M. I am very sorry you did not mention some place where I might direct a letter which might reach you before you should arrive here, but presuming you did not intend to avoid my correspondence I now address you and hope you get the letter at Farmington I have calculate to go home this fall and shall probably do so though I should regret thus to loose the chance of seeing you on your way to "Far West" I shall think it unkind if you do not advise me from some point on your route when you will be in Terre Haute that I may not be absent. I insist upon your writing from  Columbus, O. When at Columbus, O. I wish you to find James Kilbourn Jr a cousin and esteemed friend of mine He is a young Physician of the "Reformed Medical School" was recently married as he has informed me by letter and is a very clever fellow. He will be glad to see you and will tell you about Uncle Asahel Hart's family.  At Indianapolis you may if you please present yourself and lady to John W Osborne, Editor of the Indiana Farmer and Stock Register, and of the Indiana Tem- perance advocate. Mr Osborne is my friend  and will be glad  to be civil to my brother. Fourteen miles from Terre Haute East on the National Road is a place called Van Buren only one family there however (Mr Cunningham's) They formerly lived here

 New York March 28th 1850  Mr. Woodruff  Dear sir,  Yours of the 26th inst came to hand. I supposed I could borrow in Portland the amt Mr. C mention- ed, and wrote according to Cs request  to have it forwarded to you without delay. I recd information from there yesterday that they had already ad- vanced Mr C all they could possably spare and that they could not advance or loan a cent more. There is no pos- sable way of my procuring any funds here at presant. I wish you would write E and state to him the circumstances just what amount it will require to  start with and that a part must be sacrificed unless that amount can be obtained, also inform him when you will leave Boston.  Mr S is here I had a long interview with him this morning, he was to write his partner to day. I think if you 
 write him particulars, they will raise the  amount required for you, or a bout the give them as much time as possabe to do it in. (I wrote E again to day) I should be very sorry to have you disapointed as the result would be bad you can be assured if ^it^ was in my  power to do any thing here I should most cheerfully do it at once. I will understand it. We shall expect you to call upon us when you pass through Our City, if you should not  remain over night you will find me with B Sanger over Bulkley & Claflins store no 68 Cedar St. or if  you do not intend making any stay here and will write me when you  will be here, and when I can see you I will call upon you. Our place of residence is No 19-17th Street one door from Broad way.  Resp Yours J S Shaw  To Mr W Woodruff

 [sideways text] Rec'd Apr. 11 - 1888  ans'd [Apr.] 12 - [1888] - [end of sideways text]  PRESIDENT'S OFFICE  CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST. OF  LATTER-DAY SAINTS. GIBSON MILLER & RICHARDSON OMAHA.  P. O. BOX B.  Salt Lake City, U. T.  April 5th 1888.  Elder Joseph F. Smith,  Washington, D. C.  Dear Brother Joseph F.:  A longer time has elapsed  since our last communication to you than we intended;  but we have been so engrossed with business and con- stant meetings of the Council that this is the first  leisure we have had to send you a letter in acknow- ledgement of several that we have received from you.  The following dispatch was sent to you yesterday:  "Sayer write fully concerming your ar- rangements for emigration to Teasdale immediately. Through  rate from Liverpool to Salt Lake fixed at fifty five dollars.  Instruct Teasdale to collect through fares as usual and 
 pay them to Huntington agent at Liverpool and cable me amount to make up railroad fares and I will for- ward to Newport News. Request him to ascertain fare  from Copenhagen and cable me."  We hope it reached you safely and that you  have been able to communicate fully with Brother Teas- dale (who seems greatly exercised concerning the emigration)  so that he might be able to make his arrangements for  transportation from the Continent. Several of his letters  of late have been very strongly pleading against any  change. I have written him to-day upon these points  and explained to him the position and informed him  that though Guions were our friends and we felt kindly  disposed to them, yet this was not a matter of senti- ment, but of money. Our poor people were not able to  pay large amounts and it was quite a consideration with  us to have a low fare. Besides, Mr. Huntington had  been an undeviating friend of ours for many years in  political matters and had rendered us aid on many  occasions, and always responded when called upon; so 
 that we were not leaving Guions to go to someone who  had no regard for us. He seems to be troubled about  transportation from the Continent and seems to think that  no one can have the same advantages that the Guions Co. has had in this respect. But before we engaged  with the Guions Co. our people were brought from the  Continent without any difficulty, and we presume by  a little management they can again be transported to Liverpool in the same way.  Malu (The news that you have written us con- cerning your interviews with Maude and Dellie has  been very satisfactory. Their letters also have been  quite encouraging, and Maude is particularly kind in  his expressions concerning yourself and the associations  they have had with you. We trust that their labors  there have been of benefit and that the effect in our  favor will be apparent to our brethren, without their  knowing how these results are brought about. Maude writes that he is overworked and almost broken down, 
 so we suppose he has had plenty to do for other parties  as well as for us.)  We regret that Brother John W. Young should  feel oppressed either with monetary embarrassments or  with any depression of mind. It certainly would have  given everyone of his friends great pleasure to have seen  him continue his labors in connection with yourself and  the brethren, and not to have allowed any improper feel- ing to arise within him concerning our action as a  committee, or yourself and the brethren as individuals.  We certainly have had no feelings but those of the utmost kindness and friendliness towards him, and  it has been a cause of regret that we should be com- pelled to say or do anything that would wound his  feelings in the least degree.  The statements which you make concern- ing your expenditures are quite satisfactory. How much  more pleasant it would have been for all of us had  Bro. John W. taken the same course that you have! 
 Mal (We can understand how the impression which Maude says is prevalent respecting their being "millions" to buy  up Congress should get out. The style in which Bro.  John W. has moved and the lavish manner in which  he has used means would naturally create such an  impression and would operate against an economical  campaign.)  You ask what accounts you should con- sider as coming under the control of the Committee.  The understanding you have got that Mr. Gibson and  Mr. Curtis and the Republican are all arrangements  outside of the State movement is correct. These gentle- men were employed and the arrangement was made  with the Republican some time before the State move- ment was thought about, and whatever means have been paid out of the "Fund" to these parties should  be separated from the "Fund" account and charged to  the account to which they were formerly charged.  Your own expenses, and the expenses of the brethren
