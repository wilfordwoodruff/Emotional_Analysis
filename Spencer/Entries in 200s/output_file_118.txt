O Hyde received a letter  from Carson valley stating that there was a company fitting out at Carson valley and at placer ville to come into our settlements for the purpose of robing and plundering.

Orson Pratt in the fore noon and J L Heywood in the afternoon    ENDENTRY February 15, 1858 ~ Monday   15 I walked up to the Historians office then to the presidents  office President C. S. Wandle and others were present. President Young conversed upon  principle and said that all our sufferings in this life was for  our good that we might learn the contrast between good and  evil Jesus descended below all things that He might ascend above  all things all men have to pass throug the same thLaw in order to receive the same Glory. Enoch, Elijah, and Moses, who were  translated will at some time have to pass through death because  the Law is that all men must tast of Death and the Lord does not counteract his own laws or break them. Some are  alarmed because so many of my family are sick But I have as good a right to be sick as any body I would not wish to  escape affliction, sickness, paine and sorrow no more than others for if we make a right use of them they will return us Blessings.   Brother Charles Wandle related to President  Young his life since he saw him told him sins and Errors his sorrow and affliction and his missions, and that He had tried to reform andc He was now on hand to do any  thing the servants of the Lord wanted President Young told  him some Young women for wives as his first wife had drawn him away and was opposed to poligamy and had kept him away from the church a long time and had turned to whoredom and had a child by another man He now had  better let her stay in the Church states whare she now  was. He said he had had a great Deal of sorrow on her  account and even had taken to drinking Brandy to overcome  the sorrow and to get sleep he had taken a half pint tumbler full  of strong Brandy when he went to bed to get sleep. President  FIGURE Young remarked I made up my mind years ago that I would  be governed by certain principles and among them I decreed  that women should not govern me neither should my passoins of Lust or anger But I would be boss over myself my passions   ENDENTRY Feb 15 1858 and appetites which principles I have endeavored to carry out in my life and if all men would do it it would be a great  Blessing to them.   In speaking upon Utah affairs Brother  Hunt Had a good deal of influence in the Calafornia Legislature and He told them and their Senator to Congress that He wanted them to appoint a Mormon for Govornor but their senator said that was an impossibility for  President Buchanan had marked out his course in relation to the Mormons and was resolved to carry it out and that was He was deter- mined to over throw the Latter Day Saints and their institutions let it cost what it would and the president would do nothing in  their favor and the government were determined to back him up in this they were determined to blot out the Church govern- ment from Utah and no power could help it. President Young said that God had helped it so far and he would continue to help it unto the End and they cannot Help themselves all the  people want us killed and those that wright write in our favor among the gentile Editors are full of sin and do not wish us well  but they have a motive in view to accomplish the Lord puts that motive in their minds yet they will not honor or serve God or acknowledge his hand in any thing but the Lord will govern and  controll them all Just as He pleases. When Capt Van Vleit was  here He many times refered to the inexaustible overflowing treasury of the United States and twenty five million of people and asked if we could stand against such a Government, and when He got back he found an Empty treasury and the Government wanting to Borrow money I have no doubt but he thought of these things  and marvelled of it    ENDENTRY February 16, 1858 ~ Tuesday   16th I spent a part of the day in the office I was in poor health many are taken sick through the whole territory with a kind of Deistemper or pestilence that almost evry one is taken with it contains chills fever, cold and caugh it confines people to ther Houses for 3 or 4 days then they go about again but few if any  of the saints die with it    ENDENTRY February 17, 1858 ~ Wednesday   17 I spent most of the day in the endowment house about 60 received their endowments.

L. Kane He was vary formal in his introduction he was vary pale and worn down having travelled night and day He was seated in an easy chair. His arival was at 8 oclok He addressed  us in the following language (though he had great difficulty in speaking.) Govornor Young and Gentlemen I come as an ambassador from the Cheif Execative of our Nation  and am fully prepared and duly authorized to lay before   ENDENTRY Feb 25 you most fully and definately the feelings and views of the citizens of our common Country and of the feelings of the execative  towards you relating to the present position of officers of  this territory and the armey of the United States now upon yor  Borders and after giving you the most satisfactory evidences in  relation to matters concerning you now pending I shall then  call your attention and wish to enlist your sympathies in behalf  of the poor soldiers who are now suffering in the cold and snows of  the mountains and request you to render them aid and comfort and to assist them to come here and to bid them a Hearty  welcome into your hospitable Young may I be  permitted to ask a private interview for a few moments with you Gentlemen please excuse my formality for a few moments  they were about 30 minutes in secret session. they then returned  to the room and Dr Col Van vleit  made a good report about us and used an influence to have  the Armey stop East of Bridger and had done a great deal  in our behalf you all look vary well you have built up a great  empire here in a short time. He spoke upon our prosperity wheat  Bread vegitables He was asked if Dr Bernhisel took his seat  in congress He said yes he took his seat He was opposed by the  Arkansaw members and a few others but they made fools of themselves for if he had been refused his seat it would have been a declerat- ion of war you have bourn your part manfully in this contest I was  pleased to see how patiently the people took it. Govornor Young asked  how the Presidents message was received the Dr said as usual in  his appointments he has been cruelly impartial. So far he has made an excellent president. He has an Excellent cabinate they are  more united and work together better than former cabinets have  done. President Young said I suppose they are united in putting  down Buchanan made  one Balk in the spanish affair and in the Black warrior affair The Cansas Kansas affair is not setled as yet and I hope it may grow worse untill the people will take it in hand. In speaking of the  money pressure he said it commenced with the failure of the Ohio  Life insureance and trust company and then the Banks and  other firms followed in their turn. Col Kane said I wish you  knew how much I feel at home I hope I shall have the privilege  of Breaking bread with these my friends. Gov Young said I  want to take good care of you. I want to tell you one thing and  that is the men you see here do not look old and the reason  is they are doing right and are in the service of God and  if men would do right they might live to a great age. there is but few men in the world that have the great amount of  Labure to do which I have I have to meet men evry hour in  the day. I stand in the streets and do more business in an hour  than Any president, King or Emperor has to perform in a day I have to think for the people constantly. I think that  you can endure more now than you could 10 years ago. if you  had done as some men have you would now have been in your grave before now. Col Kane said that I fear that I can endure more than I could 10 years ago for I feel that my life dont  pay and I feel like going away as soon as it is the will of God to take me   ENDENTRY Feb 25 President Young remarked I know to take this life as it is  and as men make it it does not appear worth living in  but I well tell you that when you see things as they are you will find life is worth preserving and blessings will follow  our living in this life if we do right. Now if God should  say I will let you live in this world without any pain or sorrow we might feel life was worth living for but this is not in the economy of God. we have to partake  of sorrow affliction sorrow and death and if we pass  throug through this affliction patiently and do right  we shall have a greater reward in the world to come I have been robbed several times of my all in this life  and my property has gone into the hands of my Enemies  but as to property I care no more about it than about  the dirt in the streets ownly to use it as God wishes it But I think a great deal of a friend a true friend  an honest man is the noblest work of God and to live  in such a society is a great Blessing but we shall live  to enjoy that privilege. It is not in the power of the United  States to destroy this people for they are in the hands of God  and so are we and he will do with us as he pleases and  if he does right God will preserve us. The Lord does  many things which we would count as small things. A poor man came into my office I felt by the spirit that He kneeded five dollars in money. I took it out  of my pocket and gave it to him I soon after found a  five dollar gold peace in my pocket which I did not put  there. I soon found another this was put in my pocket by the Lord or some agent. many think that the Lord has nothing to do with gold but he has charge of that as well as any other element. Brother Nauvoo if we had to leave our Houses let then go we will go to the mountains and in a few  years we will have a better City than we have here, this is fulfilled. He also said we will have gold and coin twenty  dollars peaces and we came here formed a city and coined the first twenty dollars peices in the United States and seeing the brethren poorly clad He said it would not  be three years before we could by clothing cheaper in salt Lake valley and before the time was out the gold digers brought loads of clothing and sold them in our city at  quarter price. He then said Brother Thomas the Lord sent  you here and he will not let you die No you cannot die till your work is done. I want to have your name live with the Saints to all Eternity you have done a great work and you  will do a greater work still. we then parted and went to our homes    ENDENTRY February 26, 1858 ~ Friday   26 I spent the day in the office Journalizing I had a social  sit down in my hous with pOrson Pratt  and A.

At the close of our interview we called upon President Young He spoke of his interview with Col Kane last evening, and He learned the following fiact in relation to his visit to us in  1846. That Maj Mitchel reported to President Polk that the  Mormons were receiving large sums of Money from the British Government and they were conniving with the indians against the  government But it was not Generally believed and some said we  were a poor persecuted people and ought to be helped instead  of being persecuted and it was proposed to give us a part of  Kansas Territory which would have been done had it not have  been for secretary Marey he said he would resign if it was done  and finally when it was known that General Carney was friendly  to us he was sent off and when Col Allen was appointed to  take charge of the Mormon Battalion and he became our friend the Doctors killed him Col Kane was sent out by the president  to know the truth concerning us as a people and make a true  report of it which he accomplished and done us good.

Mr Cooper replyed that Mr Kenny  did not believe in that system. President Young said the  United States are determined to lay their hands upon all  that country. Mr Cooper said their is a treaty with England and the U.S. that Neither party can take  possession of that country. B. Young said they care no more about any treaty than a Horse does a spiders web  in his way to his feed they will break any treaty they please when they have the power. Now if you have  any Proposals to make we will ^hear^ them. Mr Cooper said  we would like to hear your proposals.

Mr Kinny sympathizes  with us in our war but we have no war with any body the United States are making war upon a little handful  of men they may make war as long as they please and if they drive us hard enough we will show them fun and their has not been a more imbecil Government  on Earth than President Buchanan has manifested during his administration if hise had set in his Chair and said  not a word but remained as a monument and employed a Boy 10 years old to have done his his business he would have manifested more wisdom than he has done. If you have  any propisition to make to me I wish you to do it itn writing  but with a strict understanding that none of us will ever  go to that country, if we occupy that country we will do it  with people from other country, they said they would make  their proposition in writing these remarks are ownly a  sketch of the Conversations which passed.

Col Kane is as good a Lawyier as we will find abroad and he sustained us in our course and said  that it was the cream of creams. you have taken  the right course and I want to have you keep in the right. I would not have you had you taken any other course for nothing. President Young said  this is the reason why we have let the army alone Col Kane said I have feared all the time that  you would chew that whole Armey up.   President Young said Gen Houston had it right when he said if you make war upon them you will get  awfully whiped. But President Young said Buchanan  is determined that it shall be war and Nothing  but war He wished to be President now or never  exspected to be. while speaking upon the subject of treason and being tried for treason, He said to Hosea Stout I want to have you get all the testimony upon that subject you can to gether in the defence I should show that I as the Governor of this Territory  had a right to resist an armed force entering into  this Territory In as much as the President of the United States gave me no notice of sending an army  to this Territory or of removing me from office then show that the President of the United States had no right to make war upon any states or Territory upon  mere rumour untill investigating the subject Now for the President to make use of the language he did in that Early stage to employ spies what use had they for spies when their was No war, poor Devils they laid a plan to make war upon the people  and not to make peace.   Brother Box and Allen called in to report what they found in researches they saw they found good grass  on the mountains but no water for stocks but in  places snow was 15 feet deep, they found one pocket  large enough to hide all the people in Provo   President Young said I will not be tried in a court by  our Enemies while under their power it will be   ENDENTRY May 25 Settelled either amicably or by the rifle.

Mr Cooper called also, and said that he was in the Musketoe country 9 months and that he found  it a good country and would rather live theire than to  in any other country. President Young said to Mr Cooper  what could Mr Kenny mean or think of us to send  to us as he has, does he think we are fools? The United States would give millions of dollars to have us go to that country  for then they could lay their hands upon us. I would not go  to that country if it was covered 15 inches deep with gold  and we owned it all. we are here and here we will stay  in this Territory. He conversed one hour upon our faith    ENDENTRY May 26 policy and intentions. Buchanan was not a man to plan or lay wires or chalk out the way for the prosperity of the Nation. If the whole Nation was  boiled down into one man and he possessed the knowledge of the whole I could teach him the principle of Law and Government for I know more than the whole of them   President Buchanan has manifested the greatest folly of in his official acts of any man that ever occupied the  Presidential chair.

The following is a synopsis of the conversation that passed  between them Col Allexander called yesterday and had a short  interview and it was vary agreeable. President Young said   ENDENTRY Aug 9th I was much pleased with him and am satisfyed that  if he had the sole command of the Armey and I could have  had three hours conversation with him all would have  been right and they could have come in last fall as  well as now. President Hartney how he  liked the place. He said well ownly I dont like to go  to Parawan to attend to the Legislature. It will be a  pleasant ride for you through the snow. I had a plenty of  that last winter. I went back to the states through the  snow. I have been confined some 10 years years in  the merchantile business and it was intoo close confine- ment for my health the Journey to this country was  an inducement for me to come that I might have  more exercise. Mr Hartnett asked if our difficulties  were not all setteled. B Y yes so far as they can be  as far as I know. I have been driven 5 times from  my house and home without any Just cause, this time I  did not wish to be driven. The President of the United  States has given us a good deal of Trouble, Buchanan sent an armey to us and stoped all communication  with ^us^ by stoping the Mail then laid a plan for our destruction Hartney said I did not understand it so. B. Y said what  did you suppose they sent an armey for. He said to  guard the trains and protects the people against the Indi- ans andc, did you not believe that we had burned the  court Records and broaken the United States Laws. He  Answered I did, This was all fals, we have never  opposed any good men who were attending to their  own business but I have alway taken the Liberty to speak  my mind freely upon any subject or the acts of wicked  men who would act outrageous. Hartney said that He  did not think that president Buchanan intended to  have the army fight. He told me when he found  that there was to be war that He was not willing to  have any Blood shed untill He had sent out Peace Commission- ers sent to the people and try ^to^ make peace President asked  why did he stop the Mail without any cause, they have  stoped the mail several times when they were about  to commence a persecution upon us they did it in  Polk sent an Agent to demand  500 men of us in the wilderness and made arangements  to have us destroyed if we did not comply. Gov Bogs  Agent told me that the mormons were the best people  He ever saw and if they would mingle with the people  and do as we do all would be well but we did not feel  disposed to do it and we were driven out of the state  because of our religion, this Armey boasted all the  while that they would kill our Edlders and take the women  and do what they pleased with them. Hartney said  I came with the army and did not hear such language  as your people say was among them. No they would  not say before you what they would among themselves  I want the United States to let us alone and let us mind  our own business and keep the Laws of God and the Constitution   ENDENTRY Aug 9th of the United States as we always have done then  our difficulties will be settelled as far as they can be but this people will not be driven from these  mountains we shall fight first. we do take the  liberty to speak of the acts of men when they debase themselves by their acts, but this People hold the Constitution of the United States sacred. Now should  Eckles who came and spent the  winter in Green River Country and hadd a mob mock court before he took the oath of office and brought in  Bills of Indictment against thousands of citizens  who were innocent of crime Now if I was  to speak about his acts they would accuse me of speaking against the Constitution of the United  States and say I was guilty of treason No man  can Justly find any fault with any of my  official acts except the stoping of those trains  and that I done to save the sheding of Blood    ENDENTRY August 10, 1858 ~ Tuesday   10th I called at the office in the Afternoon called  upon President Young in the evening with Brother Wheelock and spoke to the president about Holding  publick meetings on the business of the Agricultural Society He did not wish meetings called upon any subject.

When Col Kane came to visit us He tried to point out a line of Policy for me to persue  but I told him I should not turn to the right or left  or persue any course ownly as God dictated me I should do nothing ownly what was right and when  he found that I would not be influenced ownly as the spirit of the Lord led me he felt discouraged and said he would not go to the armey But He finally said if I would dictate he would execute I told him  as he had been inspired to come here he should  go to the armey and do as the spirit led him to do  and all would be right and he did so and all was right. He thought it vary strange because we were not afraid of the armey I told him we were not afraid  of all the world if they made war upon us the Lord was able to deliver us out of their hands and  would do it if we did right. God controlls all  of these matters. Now when the armey was coming here there were many Indians who come here and wanted to fight the soldiers I would not Employ them this made many of them mad and they Joined the soldiers and wanted to fight us. If they had commenced war against the United States it would have been a general  war they would have destroyed the western  cities. Br Kimball said that Col Kane asked what would be the result of he spoke against  the Mormons Brother Kimball told him his  mind would become Barren and he could  not do any good but would droop and die away but  as long as you will stand up for the truth you will  be fruitful and feel well. Elder Kimball said that the day would come when our boys who are now riding around the street will be inspired to do some of the greatest things you ever heard of the subject of the three Esstates was spoken off Br  Kimball said that he believed that those who were valiant in the first esstate would be in this and would be crowned in glory in the next the day is at hand when things will be done here on Earth as it is done in heaven then Enoch will come  and fall upon our necks and we upon his and we  shall kiss each other.

Broth Baker was tried for whiping  one of his wives vary severely. He had married two sisters the daughters of James Staples one about 5 years ago, the other about two years she had been  the wife of Andrew Hooper. Brother Baker had Quarrels  with wihis wives and children almost daily and Ann  was about to leave him but before she left Baker had some words with her and then he beat her  on each side of her head with the flat side of his hand untill the Blood run out of her ears and  one Eye was vary black. She gave her testimony  about the whole affair she said he struck her as though he was going to knock down an ox he struck her about 10 times on the side of the head in telling the story they talked back and forth and made cross statements Betsey was then called upon to give her statement but she did not wish to talk Her Father James Staples told his daughters to tell the truth without any regard to any body and said she had entered many complaints  to him against Baker and if she now would not tell  the truth and tell the thing as it is he did not wish to  have her come home hereafter with a tale of wo, but she would not talk much President Young then  said Betsey I want you to tell the truth and not keep any thing back. you will be wanting a Bill of divorce by  and By from Baker and if you dont tell the story now I dont want you to come hereafter with a tale of sorrow still she did not feel light like talking. I  dont want to have you leave Brother Baker if you do not wish to but I do not wish you to come home here after with a tale of complaint. your place is to talk now still she said but little she acknowledged  that Brother Baker took her off from the Bed  and slaped her {bottom} Budt did not hurt her but said  he had whiped her sister hard. But as she would   ENDENTRY Aug 21 not talk Brother Baker was kalled upon to tell his story  which was some what lengthy he acknowledged whiping his wife but said he was not mad but timed  his blows according to the strength of her head, said he was willing to abide by the decission of the council President Young said that if this woman was subject  to desease these blows would probably cost her her life If he had have treated me in this way I would have  cut his throat, and there is many women who would  have done it. I would not trust a dog with Brother  Baker or put one in his care for he does not know how to treat either man or beast.
