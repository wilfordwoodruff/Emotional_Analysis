He has raised a goodmany peaches and apples and some thousand pounds of goodgrapes as good as I ever tasted; and Great Salt Lake City isas hard a place to live in as there is in these mountainsMy wood for one fire cost me some 175 dollarsThese Kanyons are full of good fruit whichyou can get and set out. I have several kinds of good currentswhich I got from the Kaynyons which bear large and finefruit. These things all help to adorn the earthNow go to and build up this place andmake a beautiful city. You have a good place aroundthe State House for a city and gardens and orchards. Thesoil is sandy and you have plenty of manure to make it richThe people must learn and practisecleanliness in this life. Some people think they can live alltheir days in filth and dirt never even washing their bodies, thendie and go to heaven and be clean. But if you do notlearn and practise cleanliness in this life you will have to learnand practise it in the next before you are received into thesociety of those who are clean pure and holy.You have got to be passive inthe hands of God. As the Prophet has said if we are not passive in the hands of God as clay is in the handsof the potter we shall have to be cut off from the wheael andflung into the batch and ground over again before we canbe made vessels of honour. What can we be made vessels ofhonour [illegible]after we have been mared in the hands of the potterand ground over again? Yes this will be the case withmany but it is far better to be passive in the hands ofGod and be made vessels of honour the first time than

 to wait till we have to be ground over again. This is a figurethat the Prophet Jerehmiah made use of. Now President Youngis the master Potter here on earth and we should be subject tohim in all things. We should all remember that we have to render up our Stewardship to God; therefore we should be faithfulin all things and I pray that the Spirt of God may rest uponyou that you may do right and be saved with a full salvationand I ask it in the name of Jesus Christ: Amen.I wrote a long letter to Col.

There was a mystery hangingover the company part of whom were prisoners among whomwas Babbitt. He wore chains part of the way half inearnest and half in jest.President Young spoke on the Sundayupon the subject of mens judging each other. Hesaid he reproved men for their acts, but he was notprepared to cast men down into hell for their imperfectionsand acts until he knew the hearts of men and the principlesby which they were governed. He also said that aperson always had to experience the opposite and passthrough sorrow pain and affliction before he couldbe exalted to glory; and if a man had the exact

Grant had told themand he blessed the congregation of Saints.Elder Dunbar sung and the Assembly wasdismissed.Conference was adjourned till the 6th day of April1857.In the evening the Seventies and Elders ^met^ in the Tabernacle.The House was full. The first seven Presidents were present withJoseph Young presiding.President ^Joseph^ Young occupied the forep^art^ of the meetingby transacting the business of the quorums. Seventy Quorumswere called upon and found to be mostly full. He then calledfor a subscription from the Seventies but he got but littleJedediah M. Grant then arose and said"There are some things that grieve me. President Young wasasked if it would not be well to send the Presidents of the Seventiesout. He said no. They would preach the people to sleepand then to hell. Now this shows me that there Presidentsof the Seventies are asleaep and that there is something wrong withthem. If this is the case that they would preach the peopleto sleep and then to hell then this body of counsellors are guiltyof sins either of omission or commission and I would adviseJoseph Young to cut off his counsecil and drop them andappoint men in their stead who are full of the Holy Ghost andwho will act with him and assist him."President Grant continued in a similar ^manner^ to wake 
 glory that Jesus had he would have to die in the same way andif a man passed through this world without passing through thedregs of poverty he would have to pass through it before he couldbe exalted to eternal riches in their fulnessThere is no other way for men to get exaltationbut to follow their file leader. The Twelve have no right toask the Presidency why they do this or that or why they tellthe Twelve to do this or that. They only go and do as theyare told and the same principle should go through every quorumin the Church and Kingdom of God on the earth and when this ruleis observed then the Kingdom will be ours.He reproved the people for selling their landwarrents and said the wicked would put those very landwarrents upon our possessions and then there would be a fusswith the Mormons and that was what the people of the worldwanted.On the afternoon of the 9th I attended court onthe trial of Judge Drummond for murder or upon anaccusation of it. It was first brought before the ProbateCourt. Then Judge Drummond got out a writ ofHabeus Corpus given by Judge Kinney. The case ofthe right of writ was tried before Judge Kenney the daybefore, and Mr Miner and Mr Ketting took a strongstand against the Legislature and the laws of Utah. Assoon as the Court opened to day Judge Drummondinformed the Court that he wished to withdraw the wholesuit and Judge Kinney informed him that he would have to be remanded back to the Probate Court. He saidhe knew that but he wished to withdraw the suit withoutmallace. It was withdrawn and the Court closedIn the evening of the same day theLegislature and the citizens of Filmore met in the 
 up the Presidents and the Seventies just as he been of late preachingrepentance and reformation to all Israel.-[He took up President Joseph Youngs counciland said"Look at them. Now here is brother Levi HancockWhy he will fiddle diddle di fiddle diddle do and fiddle diddlediddle dum and tweedle diddle ta. Now he may preacha month and there would be no more Spirit of God in it thanthere would be in a cabbage leaf. Now if you wouldpreach the people ^to sleep and^ to hell you are guilty of some great ^henious^sins either of omission or commission. You have eithercommitted adultery or some other sins and you ought to bedroppedHere is brother Herriman. Now if you willpreach the people to sleep and to hell you are guilty of somegreat sins either of commission or omission ahave committedadultery or some great sins and you ought to be droppedBrother Herriman might preach a month; then you mightput it all into the eye of a cambric needle and there would beas much room in it as there would be for a bull frog in theAtlantic OceanAlbert P. Rockwood if you would preach thepeople to sleep and to hell, you are asleep dead and guiltyof committing adultery or some great sins. There is nosap in you. You are as dry as an old musk rat skinand you ought to be droppedAnd Zerah Pulsipher if he would preachthe people to sleep and to hell you are guilty of some abominablesins of commission or ommission of committing adultery orsome great sins and ought to be droppedAnd I would say the same ofBenjamen Clapp and Horace S Eldridge according to

Hewas followed by Judge Stiles Potter Rockwell Orson PrattEnoch Reese John S. Fulmer and then Governor Youngclosed. They brought to light many interesting things. Ireported all their speeches and had them in reserve. Themeeting was adjourned to the Tabernacle in Great Salt LakeCity Saterday the 26th of Jan. 1856On Sunday the 13th President Youngdelivered one of his greatest Sermons. I was not at themeeting but collected the following synopsis mostly fromThomas Bullock's report.SermonDeliveredBy President Brigham YoungAt FilmoreJan 13th 1856By our acts we have said to the world weare Christ's and we have exhibited it more than any othersof the Christian world. Every thread and tie thatbinds man to man has been broken assunder, in consequenceof receiving the fulness of the Gospel of Christ. Menhave left their wives; wives their husbands; children theirparents and parents their children; brothers their sisters, andsisters their brothers in order to be gathered with the Saintsof God that they might partake of salvation. [illegible]^This people haveproven to the world by their acts that they have a knowledge of the way of life and salvation^This people have proven to all menthat they can sacrifice every endearment in this life for 
 the President's words they are alsleep and ought to be droppedI think that Brother Joseph ought to cut them offand prune the trees around him.How can the body be kept alive and healthywhen the head is asleep and dead? It has been with greatreluctance that I have voted for the Presidents of the Seventiesfor a long time and I will say to those Seventies if your presidentshave gone to sleep dont you go to sleep but keep awake. Ifyour Presidency have committed adultery and done wrongand committed great sins that will damn them dont youdo it but wake upIs there any man ^who is^ in that council who hasbeen ordained a counsellor to Joseph Young? If so I do notknow it; but each man was ordained a President and is underas much obligation as Joseph Young is to magnify his callingand do his duty. But they never think of such a thing oftaking any burden upon their shoulders, but leave it allfor Joseph Young to do; and he has to drag them alongWhen I vote for Rockwood Pulsipher Herrimanand Levi Hancock I do it very reluctantly and I have doneso for years.Now I want to have you to wake up and doyour duty.]-On the 9th Elder Franklin D. Richards and hiscompany called upon President Young to settle all their matters asagents afar the Church abroad.Some remarks were made last Sunday nightrelative to the children of Joseph Smith. President Youngsaid I have no rega fears with regard to the family of JosephGod will take care of them and all will be rightWe had just pastsed through another GeneralConference and such an one I never saw before. The Spirit 
 eternity life and salvation and we prove that we bear this principlethrough every difficulty which we are called to pass throughIt is our duty to make every sacrifice that isrequired of us so that our Father in heaven, the holy angels andall just men who sit enthroned in glory and power and dominionmay look upon us in the character; that is that they may see in theirkingdoms that we are willing to make every sacrifice (if I maycall it a sacrifice) and not looking to man in order that we maysecure a seat with them in eternal light and glory. Butnotwithstanding all the light and knowledge we have of life andsalvation do you not see how easy it is for us to turn awayto the right and to the left and say and do many things whichwe afterwards regret and wish we had not done. Is it not the scase with us all more or less? It isI see a thousand weaknesses in myself thatI now regret and it is so with all those who have the lightof the Spirit of God. They can see their weaknesses andregret them and they will try to overcome them. I cannotonly see these things in myself but I can see them in my brethrenfor when I learn myself and Brigham I learn my brethrenBy this rule I know all of youWe give way to temptation and angryfeelings against our brother and whant to be revenged on himI ask is this a righteous feeling? No it is not and yetwe live day by day and week after week and year afteryear in this wayThe people will be guilty of a little lyinga little swearing a little deceiving and a little stealing. Doyou think you can be forgiven of all your sins and be forgivenin a moment? No you cannot every Latter-day Saintknows better. This would be sectarianism. Thereligion of the world is that a man may commit murder 
 of God is like a flame among the leaders of this people andthey were throwing the arrows of the Almighty. Jedediah M.Grant was as a sharp two-edged sword and he was callingupon the people to wake up and repent of their sins. The Elders alsowho had returned from their missions to Europe were full of theHoly Ghost and the accounts which they gave of their missionsand the dealings of God with them had been very interestingI spent the 11th in the Historian'sOffice making a ^commencement^ upon the History of Brigham YoungPresidents Brigham Young and Heber C Kimball and Joseph andJohn Young came into the Office and heard read what was writtenand corrected what was wrongThe Texan Company arrived in the Citythis day at 4 o'clock P.M.In the prayer ^circle^ on Sunday Elder LeonardWilford Hardy was called forward and Presidents Brigham YoungHeber C Kimball and Jedediah and M ^M^ Granat and Franklin DRichards and Wilford Woodruff laid hands upon his headand ordained him to the office of an High Priest and a Bishopand also as the First Counsellor to Bishop Edward HunterThe following is a synopsis ofThe Ordination and Blessing of Leonard Wilford HardyAs Bishop and First Counsellor to Bishop Edward HunterGiven Sunday the 12th of October 1856. President Young being mouthBrother Leonard Wilford Hardy, In the nameof Jesus Christ and by virtue of the Holy Priesthood we layour hands onupon your head and ordain you to be a HighPriest and a Bishop in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-daySaints. And we also ordain you to be the First Counsellorto Bishop Edward Hunter who is the Chief Bishop in the 
 and when on the gallows he can repent and be forgiven and goright straight into Abraham's bosom. But this is false doctrineIt is not true.Some may say I cannot overcome my passionswhen I am tempted and tried: I cannot help giving way to myfeelings; I must give vent to them and scold and sometimessware and I cannot help it. But I can tell you, you canhelp it. You have got to help it some time or other or youcannot be saved. You have got to begin to learn tolearn to overcome. You should begin to improve dayby day; shun the errors as you see them and improveupon them. Be a better man and woman to-morrowthan you are to day. Continue to improve. Thereis not a man or woman here but what can do better thanthey do.But says one "Brother Brigham says hardwords. So I do use harsh words. I am death andhell on the wicked; but you never hear me speak evil ofby brethren. But I will reprove wickedness among thehuman familyAs your leader I will say let us try toimprove our lives. Let us overcome every temper andevil passion that arises within you. You can shut yourmouth and keep your tongue still and quiet; and the nexttime you are tempted you can overcome it easier. Keepsilence and it will give you a great victoryMothers when you are cross andattempt to correct your children, conquer yourselves first.Fathers when you feel any of the evil passions of your naturearise then you need the grace of God to help bring yourselvesinto subjection that you may go in the Spirit of meeknessuntil you get the victory over your feelings

Thefollowing is a synopsis of theOrdination and Blessing of Jesse C. Little as Bishopand Second Counsellor of Edward Hunter Chief Bishop.Given Sunday October the 12th 1856.

 We are liable to get out of the way. We should notdo wrong knowingly for if we say or do things which are wrong weare under obligation to confess our faults. It would be a hardmatter for me to confess that I had done a wrong knowinglyYou should be goverened by righteousness.Let every Elder in Israel look upon his brethren and sisters likelittle children. When a person does wrong in his foolish weaknesslook upon it as such.We see the children of men laboring hard to obtainwealth. They labor night and day to obtain this object. But wealthwill not give you wisdom; but if you will shun evil and extend thehand of charity to every living being and do good to all as far asyou have an opportunity. This will grow in you and you willincrease in wisdom and knowledgeWe should live so as to enjoy the Spirit ofrevelation that we may know the will of God concerning us inall things. You should not live for yourselves alone forif your affections are not placed on the Lord Jesus Christ and youdo not possess charity you will miss the gate and not enter intothe glory of God yourselves; for you will not receive the Spiritof the Gospel.You ^hearts^ should be empty^ied^ of everything that ^but^ theSpirit of the Gospel that you may be filled with the spiritof revelation that you may know the voice of the Good Shepherd;^for if this people were to lose the Spirit of revelation and turn from righteousness they would be liable to beled down to hell but while the people keep the spirit of God and of revelation with them they would know thevoice of the Good Shepherd.^If I was to get out of the way would not allwho had the Spirit of God see it as they did Sidney and Strangand William Smith? ^Yes they would^ When Sidney Rigdon claimed to bethe Shepherd and leader of this people the people knew not hisvoice; but when the true Shepherd spoke they knew hisvoice and they followed himIt is the duty of this people and theirprivilege to live in such a manner that they cannot be deceived 
 You shall have visions dreams and the spirit of prophecy; andthou shalt have the gift of discernment to know the hearts of thechildren of men: And we seal these blessings upon your headand seal you up unto Eternal Life in the name of Jesus Christ:Amen.The Gospel in the English Language the Most EffectiveAt the 14 Ward meeting Elder Franklin D. Richards testified thathe had found the people more ready to carry out the principlesof this Kingdom who had been taught it in the English languagethan those who only understood the Welsh and other languagesIt had seemed like speaking through the quill to the WelshChurches all the time.Presidents Brigham Young ^Heber C KimballJ. M. Grant on the 14th^ went out to meet the emigration but they hadto return to the city on the 15th in consequence of President Youngbeing very sickNext day in company with Heber C. KimballI visited President Young. We found him feeble butmuch recovered. The sickness had mostly left him as soonas he had returned over the CBig Mountain towards the cityThere had seemed something very mysterious about his sicknessHe was taken very severely on the evening of the 14th withpain in the kidneys and bowels and he nearly fainted awayPresidents Kimball and Grant administered unto him and prayedfor him and he began to recover. The Brethren felt thatthe valley in which they were was ful^l^ of devils. They hadto go on to the mountain before they could get the spirit ofprayer. They felt that there was a legion of devils congregatedaround them in the valley where the^y^ were and trying to destroythem. They also felt that there was evil intended againstthem on the road and that they should leave that valley and 
 by any deceiver.It is your duty to live your religion. No man canmagnify the Priesthood and his calling unless he lives his religion and unlesshe is filled with the Spirit of revelation of the holy Ghost and of theHoly Priesthood: then he can magnify his calling and do his dutyto his neighbor and all men; then there would be an end toBishop's trials and High Council trialsParents are under the greatest obligations tolive their religion. So also are the young men and womenthat when they get married their children may be begotten in holinessborn in holiness and brought forth into the world in righteousnessand then you cannot make anything but Saints of themBegin your work right; carry it onright; bring up your children right: then when they areold they will not depart from itThis is the commandment which Godmade with Abraham that to his seed there should be noend and this promise was made to him when he was childless He received this covenant from the Lord and desired to seeit fulfilled upon the earth [##Genesis 15:4-5##]Abraham was driven from his father'shouse after he had received the Priesthood. [##Genesis 12:1##] ^The Lord bestowed his Priesthood upon him by a man whose name was Melchesideck. [##Doctrine and Covenants 84:14##] When Abrahamreceived the Priesthood^ The people wereso wicked that no man would receive him; but the Lordpromised him a Seed through whom the Holy Priesthood shouldbe perpetuated forever and that to the increase of his seedthere should be no end. The Lord promised to Abrahamthis great blessing. A man can have no greater blessingthan was promised to him; that he should have childrenwho should have the Priesthood. I would not ask forany greater blessing than this for myselfThe Lord promised Abraham thatthe various ordinances of his kingdom should be administered 
 return home. So they hitched up their horses in the morning and startedfor home and the nearer they drew to the city the better they felt.Ordination of Frederick Kesler to the Bishoprick.Sunday Oct. the 19th 1856President Young at the close of prayers called upon Bishop Hunterand his council to ordain Frederick Kesler to be a Bishop in theSixteenth Ward. They laid hands upon him and the followingis a synopsis of his ordination:Brother Frederick Kesler, In the name of JesusChrist we lay our hands upon your head and we ordain you aHigh Priest and a Bishop in the Church of Jesus Christ ofLatter-day Saints and we seal upon your head all the blessingswhich have been sealed upon you by any of the Servants of Godin days which are past and gone and we seal upon you all thepower blessing and keys of the High Priesthood and Bishoprickand you shall have power to sustain and comfort the droopingspirits of the people and we seal upon you all blessings whichare needful to sustain you in your calling and every blessingswhich your heart can desire in righteousness before ^the^ Godlord. Weseal these blessings upon your ^head^ in the name of Jesus Christ:Amen.On the 23rd when I called upon President YoungI found him in company with Bishop Taylor John Sharpand others making a contract about digging the tunnel to takeout Weber River into Davis County. The following conversationtook place:President Young said, he would not undertake thisjob unless the Bishops would bind themselves to pay as fastas we get the lumber for them; and I want $1000 paykept in advance and the people must back this matterup. Brother Taylor said they would do it. The 
 people are expecting to back it up. This tunnel will be onemile and a quarter longPresident Young asked Brother Taylor ofifhe wanted us to commence this job and go on with it?Brother Taylor said I doPresident Young said to John Sharp are youprepared to take hold and boss this job, as I cannot attendto it.Brother Sharp said he would"Now Brother Taylor you go and get your hands andgo to that dam and build that and do it well. Do nottrust any man to boss that job who is not well acquainted withthe buisness. Now I want to give you some instructionabout this job. Get you a gang of hands and say to themNow I will give you so much interest for doing so much onthis land. ^canal^ Let the Bishops take their men and go withthem and have the Canal staked off and say to the companiesthat those who get their job done first they shall have asilver medal.Brother Taylor asked, "Shall we enlarge Kay'sSettlement" and was answered "No; until the people thepeople build up and improve what they have got"What shall those do who are there and have no place to build upon""Let the people who have more land than theirycan improve to a good advantage devide with them. Nowyou will want some shanties but I don't want anything builtbut dug outs. Dig your holes in the bank and cover overwith slabs as they will be temporary buildings"Wm. Eddington Hugh Findley andWm G. Mills called upon President Young to consult hisfeelings upon the continuation of the entertainments of the 
 Literary and Musical Society. They came as a committee fromthat societyPresident Young said, "I do not like some things thathave been there. Most of the sisters and brethren have writtenvery good essays; but some have been vulgar. But I have noobjection to their being continued if they can be conducted in righteousnessI would like you to get a globe revolving there and give lecturesupon gelography history and science. They all belong to our religionand there are but few who can retain in their memory the geographyof the world. So lectures would be interesting to many uponthis subject. I do not want to hear baldadash; but I wantto hear that which is right and tends to goodA man arrived from Laramie from whom welearned that A. O. Smoot was at Green River and that the lastcompany whom the Indians killed the same number as the soldiershad killed of the Indians they in turn killed of the whites andthen they were satisfied and gave themselves up and they also surrenderedMrs Margetts whom they had taken prisioner.Snow on the Big Mountain was eight inchesdeep.Elder Dan Jones arrived on the 24th quite unwell and on Sundaythe 26th he was called up to speak but could only do so for a shorttime. He looked nearly worn outAt the close of President Kimball's remarks whichfollowed he called upon all the horse teams in the city and countyto go into the Mountains and pick up the companies who werecoming with hand-carts and bring them into the city. One hundredand fifteen were raised in a few minutes and all were prepared tostart in the morning. They were to take grain to feed themwith. President Young was unwell and not at the Tabernacle.At the prayer circle the subject came up concerning theemigration starting so late that it had cost the Territory more 
 than it would to have bought oxen and brought them through for wehave had to send some two hundred and fifty teams out to meetthem emigration and to send some twenty tons of flour and manythousands of dollars of shoes and clothing.President Young asked why they were so lateBrother Franklin Richards said that Elder Taylor wanted to controlthe emigration and means and would not take hold and assist inthe work withoutPresident Young said that Brother Taylor was a goodman in many respects but he was not fit to handle means anymore than a child. "I am going to inform all the churchespeople and agents next season who do not take my counselthat they shall be suspended from the ChurchElder Taylor said that the Handcart companiescould not be forwarded short of £12 (pounds) which would not do at all.President Young observed to Franklin Richards"You had your possitive instructions what to do butJohn Taylor but stood in your way and you did not doas you were told and the people were sent to^o^ ^so^ late that itcost us many thousand dollars to get them in. Now whatdo you think of such thingsElder Franklin Richards said the onlyexcuse I have to offer is that Orson Spencer was deadand John Taylor took charge of all things in the States and informed me that he had instructions from President Young toattend to it which it appears was not correct. Elder Taylorwanted to handle the money himself which was wrong.I met with President Grant and all theMissionaries at the house of Franklin D. RichardsPresident Grant said Elders Woodruffand Franklin D Richards would preside over the missionaries 
 The following is a synopsis of the directions of President Grantto the Missionaries"I want you to go through the Territory and do whatGod wants you to do. Go prepared for battle. When it is necessaryjerk men up by their mains ^names^. Wake up the Bishops and all presidingofficers and then the people."Now we want to know what all men are doing throughoutthis Territory. The people are dirty: we want them to reform in thisthing. Many do not treat their children right but use them roughlyNow if a man has the Spirit of God he will use his children well andtreat them kindly. I can tell you that children are very sensativeand the treatment which they meet has a great effect upon themWe want to see to that the people are employedThe reason why we prosper in this city more than in any other is thatwe labour.I went to ^Taylorsville^ with Joseph Young and the peoplewas so dead and bad that brother Joseph wanted to go homeand not stop. I told him I would not go until I convertedthat people and I stayed until I ^had done it and they had^ got the Spirit of God. ThenI conqurerd the people. So at the city Bountiful. I preachedthere until the Spirit stoped there for days but at first theBishop was asleaepWhen you go to a place treat the people rightGet the Spirit of God and then you will know what is going onWhen you go to a place preach to the people. Dont get intoNoah's ark nor into the city of Jerusalem but just tell thatpeople what you want them to do.More was also said and then F. D. Richards spoke^and^ Daniel Spencer James Ferguson Dan Jones Edmund Ellsworthbrother Smith John Van Cott and George D Grant all spokein turnPresident Grant wished the missionaries to meet on 
 the following Friday nightRobert Scholes started on the morning of the 28thwith my horses and waggon to go into the Mountains to assist the SaintsI met President Grant on the 31st and he said there had come an express from the First Handcart company and thatthey brought bad news. They were caught in a snow storm anddying very fast. The people became chilled. They would drawall day and die at night and those who dug the graves for the brethrenwould themselves die the same day.This I learned from the messengers themselvesThey said the night before they met the company there werefive deaths. There had been some 25 deaths twenty of whomwere menThey had not heard from the 2nd Hand cart companyJoseph Young and Cyrus H. Wheelock went ahead with thenews that help was coming and George D. Grant followed withten of the best teams.There had been about fifty five deaths inthe first company in consequence of cold. The captain ofthe company had dealt out all the provisions to the people thenight before any help came and they did not know thatany help was coming. They dealt out 11 oz. to a man9 to a woman and 6 to a child. There was but little snowon the road till they got to the Rocky RidgeAt the Prayer Circle on Sunday November the 2nd President Young wished me to writeout a list of the "Commandments" which he wished to makeuse of in the ReformationBrigham H. Young arrived on the 3rd. He had been with A. O. Smoot to St. LouisKeokuk and Nauvoo. Nauvoo looked desolateweeds growing up in the streets. He went to Emma 
 Smith's mansion but could ^not^ see any of the family. He said thatEmma had instilled into the minds of her children that it was PresidentYoung who had caused the death of Joseph and Hyrum Smith. -[Anidea more false never entered the human soul). President BrighamYoung said that he thought Joseph would have as hard work to digher out of hell in the next world as he did in this.The Gospel Scales of the ReformationOn the 4th the Presidency the Twelve the Seventies the HighPriests and the Bishops with their councils all met at the Social Hall and President Young weighed the whole of them in thescales of the celestial law of God and there were but very fewthat weighed clear in every point. President Young taughtthe people good doctrine and in a fatherly spirit.The Presidency and Twelve and others met in councilat the Historian's Office on the 8th and the subject came up ofreading the sermon of President Young concerning the late emigrationand what cause^d^ so much suffering. It was concluded tostrike out the reflections cast upon F. D Richards, and ^but^ more uponJohn Taylor for hindering the brethren from doing business forseveral weeks.President Young said Bishoph Hunter when theHandcart companies come in I want to have the Bishops take thepeople to some empty houses and appoint an overseer over themso that they may not eat themselves to death for they would killlthemselves with eating if they had an opportunity.On the 10th Elder A. O. Smoot brought inthe Church train goods &c and brother Willie the Handcartcompany. There had been 60 deaths in that companyThey were nearly chilled to death by the snows and coldin the mountains 
 Promise of the Remission of the Sins of the PeopleGiven by President Young November the 10th 1856I attended meeting of the Presidents of the Seventies in theSeventies HallWhile I was speaking President Young came in whenI closed and was followede by Herriman Hancock and Pulsifepherand then President YoungThe President promised the people in the nameof Jesus Christ that if they would repent and turn from their sinsfrom that hour all their sins should be forgiven them and notremembered against them any more for ever either on earth orin heaven.^On the 11th^ An Express came in from the teams saying thatthe teams had gone to the Sweet Water and hearing nothingfrom the companies they turned back. President Youngimmediately took measures to raise an Express to go directlyand turn the teamsters back again to continue back untilthey met the company and several horsemen were to go with themI heard early on the morning of the 13th that anExpress had come in from the Handcart company and I wentto the President's and met with all the Presidency. The followingis a synopsis of what I learnedBrother Joseph A. Young and George D. Grantparted. They agreed that they should not go any fartherthan the Devil's Gate until George came up. He did notfind the company so Joseph A. then went on to the Platteand found them at the Upper cCrossing of the Platte. They were in camp and had been nine days waiting for thesnow to go off. Soon brother George D. Grantarrived and prepared the camp for moving. He asked 
 Joseph what would his father do now if he was here^?^ Joseph A. Young said "If my father was here he would take all the books and heavy materials andcache them in order to save the lives of the people." So they agreed to doit; and they cached all their articles at Devils Gate and took up theweak and the feeble and started towards homeThey then sent an express back to have the teamscome on to them that was on the road. But brother Vancott andClaudius Spencer had got to the Sweet Water and not hearing anythingfrom the Handcart companies they turned back with their teamsand nearly all the companies followed them. This news arrivedin the city several days since and an express was sent back toturn them again to meet the handcart companiesAll the companies out of the emigration weretogether when the brethren found them. There were two oxtrains and the handcart train. Many of the old oxen haddied but the young oxen many of them were fat and fineBrother Tenant who had bought PresidentYoung's place was dead. He died near Scott's Bluffs. Thepeople were suffering with cold and hunger someDavid Kimball and others went aheadpicked out camp grounds made up fires shovelled off the snowand when the camp came up they would take the old menwomen and children who could not walk and carry them to thefires and help them get supper and then they would dancearound the fires and sing and shout to keep up the spirits of thepeople; and while journing during the day they would wade overall the streams and drag the handcarts over and carry all thelame women men and children overWhen William Kimball met with brotherVancott he took one pair of his mules and put on to his ownwaggon and told him to turn round with himthe others andfollow him to the East until they met with the companies. 
 They had returned from the Sweet Water as far as to Weber whenWilliam Kimball turned them back again. Brothers ^Presidents^ Young andKimball felt severe with Brother Vancott and Claudius Spencer forreturning, and the President said that if they had the Spirit of God withthem they would not have done it.Elder George D. Grant wrote a good letter toPresident Young giving a description of the company and their situationHe says^id^ that not more than one third of the handcart company wasable to walk and many were barefoot and freezing their toes. Whenthe brethren found them they were all together and camped in abouta foot of snow where they had been nine days waiting for thesnow to go off and to recruit the cattle.Among other things which came up at this timewas the subject of miracles. President Young said I have hada $5 gold piece put into my pocket now two days in successionI do not know from what source it came from. Brother Kimballsaid it was an angel.Brother Young then related a circumstance thatwhen he and brother Kimball was travelling East together theyhad thirteen dollars and fifty cents only and they travelled untilthey had paid $87 out of it and had sixpence left and theyreceived no addition from any known hand. Brother Kimball saidthat an angel had put it into our trunk.On the 22nd Franklin D Richards and myselflaid hands upon J. M. Grant who was very sick. This wasthe beginning of his sickness which shortly ended in his deathOn Sunday the 23rd Elder Farnhamspoke of his mission to South Australia and in the afternoonRobert Skelton gave an account of his mission in IndiaCalcutta Rangoon &cThere was a call this day made at noon formore men and animals to go into the Mountains and about 
 one hundred men arose in the congregation to go with teams. PresidentYoung said that if they had to send many more into the mountainshe thought it best to move the city into the mountains and spend the winter.I called upon President J. M. Grant and found himvery ill on the 26 and 27th and thus he continued to be. On the29th he had the worse night up to that time. The devil workedhard all night to kill his body. The brethren laid handsupon him many times and rebuked the powers of darknessThe devil would lay upon him a strong hand from his feet tohis head all through his slimbs and stomach and a rib at atime and it seemed as though he would crush his bodyBrother Grant though very weak would rebuke him an hourat a time from limb to limb and rib to rib. It was aperfect warefare all night. He was easier in the morningWe heard on this day news from the hand-cartcompany. They were to camp that night ^at Killion's^ at thefoot of the Little Mountain. Brother Decker the night beforecame in with the express. He said that the ox trainscould not even get to Bridger and that they had sent in forforty tons of flour. The cattle and people were dyingArrival of the Handcart ^Company^Sunday November the 30th ^1856^At the Tabernacle President Young made remarks concerningthe hand-cart company, who was then entering the city. He wishedthe inhabitants to take the people into their houses and nurse themup and he said that he would take all that was left.When the meeting was over we held a shortsitting in the Legislature and then went into the street and 
 saw the poor Saints who had just arrived. There were aboutone hundred waggons containing the company. Many werecripples and had their hands and feet frozen off nearly offThey were immediately distributed through the cityDeath Of President Jedediah M. Grant.Dec. the 1st 1856I called upon President Young at his office. He hadbeen down to lay hedands upon President J. M. Grant wholay very low. His lungs appeared to fill and he hadno power to raise anything from his lungs. It appearedthat he could not live but a short time unless there wasa change soon for the better. He said he felt asthough he wanted an apple some grapes or wineor something upon his stomach. President Youngsent him down some and they roasted an apple anhe eat it about 12 o'clock and seemed to relish it wellHe also drank some buttermilk which he relishedbut it was a death appetiteThe missionaries met at the Historian's officeand soon President Young came in and opened the meetingwith prayer. F. D. Richards made a short reportor address and was followed by Wilford Woodruff whoexpressed his feelings in great plainness concerning thepeople taking off from the President a part of the burdenwhich was resting upon him for he was wearing outThen all the missionaries who were sent to the differentWards were called upon to report. All made theirreports and spoke encourageingly of the reformation.F. D. Richards and myself then started down to see 
 President Grant.On our way down we met Dr Sprague who informedme that President Jedediah Morgan Grant was dead. He diedDecember the 1st 1856 20 minutes past 10 oclock at night aged 40 years9 months and 7 days.Dr Sprague informed me that he had just breathedhis last. We immediately went into the house and found hiswives and children weeping bitterly. Jesse C. Little Leonard W.Hardy Daniel H. Wells George Davisson Grant and Doctors SpragueDunyon and Israel Ivins were standing around his body. AsI gazed upon his tabernacle of clay without his spirit I felt toexclaim a mighty man in Zion is laid low—a valient manin Israel has fallen and a great champion of the Kingdom of Godis taken from ^us^ our midst.We felt his loss deeply. For two months itseemed as though he had been hurried to close up his work. Hehad been preaching for several months calling upon the peopleto repent. His voice has been like the trumph of theangel of God. He had been laboring night and dayuntil he was laid prostrate with sickness. He had shotthe arrows of the Almighty with great power among the peopleHe called at the Historians Office on the 19th of November whichwas the last day he was out. He was confined to his houseten days before his death. He had a great vision whilehe was sick which he told the brethren. He preached nearlyall the time and related all that he saw in the spirit world.Soon after I entered the house on the night of hisdeath his wife Rosetta was seized with great trembling andnervous excitement and it seemed as though her frame would shaketo pieces. We laid hands upon her and rebuked the devilwhich seemed to seize her tabernacle and she becamemore calm. I assisted Dr Dunyon in laying out 
 the body of brother Grant. I spent the night with hisremainsI left brother Grant's family a short time inthe morning called upon Capt. Hooper found him quite sick andadministered to him. Then I went to my house got a piece offine linen and Mrs. Woodruff accompanied me to brother Grant's. Igave them the linen to make a garment and robes to lay out thebody in. I went to President Young's to get Zina Youngto go down and help make the robes. President Young camein and spoke of brother Grant's death. He said we had doneall we could to save his life but the powers the other side of theveil were stronger than we were and he was wanted thereSister Zina Young walked with me toPresident Grant's and spent the day with the sisters in making the robes. I felt sick and went home and went to bed andwas sick throughout the dayBurial of President Jedediah Morgan GrantDec. the 3rd 1856.I spent most of this day in writing the obituary of J. M. GrantThe doors of our deceased brother's house wasthrown open for the people to visit the corps and preparations^were made^ for his funeral. Many thousands went through the house to visit the body. At half past nine the military beganto form in open line from the residence to the Tabernacle and threebands of music were in attendance. The Lieutenant General andstaff General Grant^'s and staff^ and all the lancers were in attendance anda company of York masons formed in the procession. Thecorps was removed to the Tabernacle and the place filled up andmany could not get in. But it took so long to get throughwith the ceremonies of the morning that it was ten minutes 
 wisdom to send men toas Teachers to the Gentile stores to preachthe Gospel to them. I considered they were wicked andcorrupt and it was like casting pearls before swine. When I closed F. D. Richards backed me up and bore testimonythat what I said was trueThen the Bishop arose and opposed mevery strongly and said that he presided over the Fourteenth Wardand he had sent the Teachers to preach to the Gentiles and hewished them to go and do it.I saw that the Devil had ensnared him.When he sat down the Teacher arose and said What shall Ido. Brother Woodruff says do not go to the Gentiles and BishopHogland says go. I arose and said obey your Bishopfor he says he will take the responsibility upon himself insending Teachers to the Gentile stores. Many of thePriesthood were fired up upon the subject but the meetingclosed and we went homeBrother Richards and myself went upto President Young's and we related what had taken place withourselves and Bishop Hogland; and President Young was astonished at the position which the Bishop had taken. Hesaid the Devil was leading him into difficulty and he couldnot extricate himself without help. He immediatelysent for Bishop Hogland who came up and the subject wastalked over and President Young showed his error andhe saw and confessed it. President Young told himthat the Twelve held the keys of the Kingdom of God in allthe world where the Presidency are not and that no Bishoppresided over any one of the Twelve in any place. TheBishop made his confession and went home.I have related this as an exampleof a principle that none might err and not as reflection 
 upon Bishop Hogland who was one of the best of men and the best ofBishopsOn the Sunday ^evening^ at the Fourtheenth Ward I was requested to speakI arose upon my feet though heavily oppressed in Spirit but theSpirit of God came upon me and was like fire shut up in my bonesand I spake to the people about 3/4 of an hour and I scarcely knewwhether I was in the body or out of the body neither could I afterwardsremember much what I said and the house was as still as the houseof death.On the evening of the following day I attended the meetingof the missionaries and Bishops. Presidents Young and Kimballwere present also Wilford Woodruff and Franklin D. Richards of theTwelve.Wilford Woodruff arose and called the names of the Bishopsand missionaries most of whom answered to their names. F. D.Richards then opened by prayer and singing and then Wilford Woodruffarose and addressed the meeting. After his address PresidentYoung sung, "O happy souls who pray'' and then addressed themeeting of which the following isA SynopsisOf the Remarks of President Young to the MissionariesDec. the 8th 1856.Brother Woodruff has given us a good testimony—a living testimonyin the Spirit and power of the Holy Ghost. Now any ofthe rest of you who have the Holy Ghost arise and speak to usthose things which will edify-[ B. L. Clapp and E. D. Wooley then spoke for a fewmoments and then President Young continued]-I don't expect to speak much to night. I havelearned to govern myself in talking as well as in other things.It may be asked if this a new work. It is not a new work 
 but our reformation is the work we begun in when we embracedthe Gospel. I have pointed out the errors of the people all thetime and shown the people their faults and told them what to doBut here is the difficulty: As soon as the Elders come home fromtheir missions in a few days they lay down their armour while they shouldkeep it on all the time and keep it bright but their minds are engrossedwith the things of the world and they lie down and go to sleep. Their only ambition is to know how they can get this house built or to geta farm horses cattle &c. Their whole soul is in the work of theworld and not the building of the Kingdom of God. But anyman who gets property upon this principle it will corode him. Hehas not wisdom to use itI have toeld the people a hundred times theydo not know how to get rich. The way for the people to getrich is to do the will of God and they must be governed by therevelations and Spirit of God.Brother Woodruff has told us here to nighthow it is. When I look upon the conduct of the people beforethe reformation commenced as I was teaching them the way ofsalvation daily and they would not give heed. It pained my heart and I felt as if I should die; but when brother Jedediah MGrant steped forward and took the burden off from me I wasrelieved but it has cost him his life. Had he not have takenthat burden upon him he would have lived a few years longer inour midst.I have felt that unless the people would awake and livetheir religion I must go down to the grave. But the burden ofthis people was taken from me and it rested on him and it hasnot yet returned to me although he is dead. Should it returnto me as it has been I shall soon follow him to the grave for Icould not live long with that weight upon meWhen you first received the Gospel was not 
 your hearts filled with love? aAnd did you not put on the Gospel armour andwould it not have continued with you all the time if you had lived yourreligion all the time but you have had hard feelings in your heartsand against your neighbor; but if the Spirit of God continued withyou it would have overcome; it would have overcome those evil feelingsAnd what if we were all to put our armour off and partake of the spirit of anger and hatred? God would spew us out of his mouth and we shouldgo down to hell together and he would raise up another people to do hiswill.After all the stupor that has rested upon this people they have beengaping for more revelation. I do not mean one man but I meanthe whole people, while they have already a great deal more than theyare worthy of and if this people do not wake up and live their religionthe Lord will take away the sources of revelation which they nowhave from the people. It is not a few men who have got to livetheir religion but it is the whole community. If we as a peoplewill return unto the Lord I know he will receive us with open armsI am glad that this Winter has commenced withoutfidling and dancing. But would there be any harm in goinginto the hall and having a dance if we felt right and kept the Spiritof God with us? No there would not. But as soon as weshould opon this door how many would keep the amour on andlive their religion and keep the Spirit of God. Not many.Some would but many would say come let us go and take a drinkand begin to get the liquor in them and they would say, "Comebrother Brigham I am ready for anything; stand out of the wayhere: Hurrah for hell; sware a little damn a little; steal a littlegamble a little and raise the devilBut we will stop fidling and dancing untilthe brethren get power to overcome these things and keep them undertheir feet. I do not intend to start dancing again until thepeople will learn to do right and live their religion. I have to war 
 with the weaknesses of man. I am encompassed with it. I knowwhat it is to fight it all the time. If you are going to continue a reformationmake up your minds to live your religion. If the people will do thisit will be as brother Woodruff says: the darkness will pass away andI can live long among this people and so can brother Kimball and othermen. But if this people will go on lying stealing swearing andwhoring I dont want to live but I want to leave the people and goto God and let the wicked go to hell. I hope that God will sendthe wicked who will not repent so down to hell quickly to be burnedup so that they may be saved in the day of the Lord JesusWhen I first came into this Church I wasan enthusiast ^and^ though^t^ I would never ^keep an account—never^ put pen to paper and neversay this or that is mine, but it is the Lords. We never can be ofone heart and ^one^ mind until we can say that all that we have is theLord's and that we are only his servants and stewards to control itaccording to his will.When the Lord gives me property he gives me wisdomto use it. We have individual rights and shall have to all eternityWhat are those rights. If I have any property horses cattle waggonsor anything else my neighbor has no right to steal it from meand if the people have the Spirit of the Lord they will know thatit is not right to take anything which belongs to another withoutliberty but let it remain where it is.We are accountable for our time to theLord. Now if you have a months leasure time and you gamblethat away and do not bring to pass any good you may just aswell throw away $20, and you are accountable for this wasteof timeI am often astonished at the follies of this people. Manywomen are asking their husbands for some new thing. Theywant a dozen new dresses and many unnecessary thingsBut what does a person want of a dozen new dresses. If this 
 people would ask for those things which are necessary and do right youwould soon see the people get rich. But what are you doing? Are you rich? No. The Lord can send the grasshopers crickets and locustThey are his armies and can eat us up and kill our cattle. He cangive us much or little as he pleases. If our eyes are single to theglory of God and we do our duty the Lord could make us as rich as^Ceasar^What would you do with it? Agrandize yourselves?No you should not; but send out millions of men to gather the poorand send mules loaded with gold to buy the nations. But now weare poor and can accomplish but littleNow I am here with brother Kimball. Ifyou wish to answer ^ask^ any question we can answer right; but for meto teach the Bishops their duty is folly for I have taught them overand over for years. Now if I was going to a Ward meeting to preachand the Bishop was to oppose me unless it was my duty to reprovehim I should sit and laugh at him but not contend with himbut When there is any difficulty between a missionary and a Bishop or any two men they should not contend about it beforethe people but talk it over among themselves and settle all differencesof opinion in the Spirit of God and not labour for the masteryRemarks Of President Heber C Kimball.Brother Kimball followed President Young and said"I am one with President Young and so was J. M.Grant. He took hold of the work with all his might to wakeup the people and it killed him. If President Young was to askme to go forth in the same way I would do it but it would cut shortmy life as it did his. I have never felt as though Jedediah wasdead. The saviorur said those that abide in me will never dieHis spirit is with us and he can do more for us now than he couldbefore. The Spirit of God is poured out upon some ma^e^n mightily 
 The reformation is doing good and the people are doing betterand those who get the spirit of God will stand and those whodo not will fall. The people are forsaking their sinsThere are things in embryio which will try this people and those events will ripen as this people doand all will have to get the spirit and revelation of heaven inorder to stand. And these things will be among all nationsand they will know it as well as I know itIt will be a hard Winter. I wantyou to wake up yourselves and then wake up your wives andchildren and stop your lying and stealing and take theburdens upon your backs which belong to you that thePresidency and Twelve may only have to carry their own burdensThe time has come or is near at hand thatmany who have trifled with the Priesthood and the things of Godwill be destroyed and go to hell; and those who are not faithfulin magnifying the Priesthood it will be taken from them andgiven to others and that quickly and I know it for angelsProphets and holy men say it and it will be fulfilledAs to dancing I am tired of it. I neverwant to see another man dance until he can do it by thepower of God. I felt that Spirit once and brother Brighamshouted Hosanna for we were both filled with the Spirit.Neither do I want to see any more feasting at present. I dontwant to see any more jealous feelings. Some of our Bishops getjealous of the servants of God. No man would be if he wasfilled with the Holy GhostI would chastize a man if he stood in myway when I know that I am a messenger sent of God. PresidentYoung says that if the people do not do right he will not staylong with them but shall go the other side of the veil. If hegoes I shall not stay long behind him because we will not have 
 one between us and if you dont do your duty we shall go soon. I havehad many men try to stand between me and President Young and whenI have been to see him many have snubed me; but I have seenenough of this; and that man who will try to do it must look outfor God and his angels will smite himI have no objection to men coming to PresidentYoung to comfort him and do him good and when he gives them a wifeto give him $10 or $20 according as the man may value his wifebut men must not try to seperate us. If they do they will be cursedI understand that brother Woodruff got a whippingfrom one of them lately; but I tell you that although he is a smallman he is all gold and you will find it so in the end. You maybe thankful to ever get as good a place as he will get for he isthe pure gold and I wish you would get as good as he is.The Bishops will not respect what the missionariessay for they are jealous. But if you will get the Spirit ofGod upon you there will be no jealous feelings in your heart. Youwant the Spirit of God and the power of the Priesthood to rest uponyou as it did upon Joseph and does upon the Presidency and TwelveTake that Priesthood upon you which belongs to you and magnifyit.The missionaries went ^want^ to wake up. Then wake up theBishops and then wake up the people and all live your religionand all will go well and if you will live ^up to^ your privilegeshere and get the spirit of this reformation. It will reach allover the earth and go to the ends of the earth and the wickedwill not have power over us; but this work will go from Zionthrough all the world as the sap of a tree will go from thetrunk to the end of every limb and twigI want to see the power of God amongthe people that they may have faith to remove mountains ifnecessary but the power of God will only increase as the Spirit of 
 God increases among the people that they may have faith to removemountainsIf we do our duty the United States should be the aggressersThe Lord would say if they came against us "Let my servant Brighamsend 200 men and they would lick them up for God would assistto fight our battles with the storm hail and snow and they wouldbe destroyed. I know this would be done but we must get the faithof the ancients.As to brother Brigham I have to say that he is just as gooda man as ever was on earth.Now wake up brethren and purify yourselvesbefore you try to purify others. Then go forth and lift up your voicelike a trumpet and call upon all men to repent and get full of theHoly Ghost and there is not a man who will do it but what will befilled with prophesyings as were the ancient Nephites and little boysof four years old will prophesyI do not wish to go to a feast or a dance untilthe people reform. There is men enough here to bring forth this reformationand men will not prosper until they do their duty to God and eachother. I have no desire to attend any recreation until this peopleare filled with the Spirit and power of God and I do not think thatPresident Young has. If you will rise up and do your duty youwill be blessed and no man that rises up against us in this placewill prosper if we do our duty and we wash our feet against themI believe in washing our feet against our enemiesThe Spirit of God has been upon us formore than a year and the people would play laugh and trifle aboutit but if they had had the Spirit of God and had done their dutythey would have seen it. This has been my feelings all the timeI have felt that the people were trifling with the things of GodBrother Jedediah is fallen. A mightyman is taken from us but his power is here. It still rests upon 
 brother Brigham and myself and when we lay hands upon another manthe Spirit of God and of Jedediah will rest upon him in full forcethat he may do the work, and fill his place as a councillor to the Presidentand I know it. May God bless you: Amen.Others spoke and then Brigham Young said: The reasonwhy we take the Elders for missionaries who have just came in is thatwe can set them to work while their armour is on for it has generallybeen the case that soon after the Elders come in they throw down theirarmour and some are so far left to themselves that they do not enjoythe Spirit of God. In answer to the question of brother Savage aboutpeople restoring what they have stolen: In the first place I wouldsay I would not steal but where it cannot be restored I would sayput it into the P.[erpetual] E.[migration] Fund to gather the poor for I would not have anythingto do with it.Others spoke and Hopkins Pendo^r^ John M Jones and JoshuaMidgely were called to go out on mission and the Bishops with their councilthe First Presidency of the Seventies the Presidents of the Elders PriestsTeachers and Deacons quorums were all requested to meet with themissionaries in the same place on Monday evening each week.Benediction by Jacob Gates.On the 10th I had an interview with Orson Hydewho had just returned from Carson ValleyRemoval of the Legislature of Utah to G. S. Lake CityOn the 12th I called at President Young's Office. He wasstill unwell. Orson Hyde H. C. Kimball and myself andG. D. Grant were in the office and H Stout and J W. Cumingshad just arrived from Filmore. The President soon came inand they gave an account of their proceedings while at FilmoreThe Legislature had met there organized passed some resolutionsremoved the seat of Government to Great Salt Lake City andadjourned to meet in G. S. L. City on the ^18th^ day of Dec. 1856. 
 1856A Dream of Heber C Kimball'son the night of Nov 25, 1856Brother Heber C Kimball related the following:"I dreamed that I was travelling with a companionand we came to a powerful rapid stream of water like the Niagara River. The waves were rolling very high and increasing insize. The waters had been muddy but were getting clearAs we came to this powerful stream we did not know ^how^ we shouldget over it. I turned my eyes a few moments from my companionand when I looked back I saw him on the other side of theriver and climbing a steep hill. I did not know how hegot there. I wanted to cross so I called to him as loudas I could. ^to stop and wait ^to^ for me but he paid no attention to me but went on as hard as he could.^ Then a person came to me and said you havean iron rod in your hand, which I perceived I had severalfeet long. The angel said to me you must use this rodand feel your way over the river and I awoke. I consideredmy dream and interpret it as follows:My companion was J. M. Grant who hassuddenly died and left me and is the other side of the veil.The waters mean the people in ^they are increasing in strength^ and growing better andclearer. The iron rod is the word of God which I mustcling to till I get through death. I consider there aregreat things awaiting this people.On the 14th of December at 4 o'clock theemigration came in, about 30 teams with 200 souls all in goodorder none of them frozen teams looked well. There was but8 inches of snow at Bridger but 15 feet in the mountains wherethey had to dig through. Next day the remainder of theemigration arrived with 20 teams and 200 souls. This wasthe last ox train company. 
 I attended meeting with the missionaries and BishopsWilford Woodruff said we have missionaries and Bishops from some20 Wards and I would like to have a report from them all. I will giveeach man some 3 minutes to speak in; then all can speak. Theyall spoke. Bishop Hunter and J. C. Little spoke first. Wilford Woodruffgave some counsel.On the 17th in company with Brother Blair I calledupon Brother Ballantine who had sent for me to administer to himHe was quite sick. We laid hands upon him and rebuked hisdesease and he was better. He had dreamt that he was about todie and saw his coffin and grave which was dug deep. Just beforehe was to die he thought he was invited to a wedding but he wastoo sick to go. And he dreamed that brother Woodruff withsome other one came to him and administered to him and hewas saved from death.The Legislative Assembly met on the 18th of Dec. in the Music Hall according to the adjournmet atFilmore. The two houses organized and we received theGovernor's Message and met in joint sessions then adjournedto our respective rooms.On Sunday the 21st after others had spokenI arose and the power of God rested upon me and I called uponElder Orson Hyde to rise up in the power of God and lead outas he was the President of the Twelve and awake up and get theHoly Ghost and the Twelve will follow you in the field andI called upon the people to awake and listen to the words of the Presidency of the Church.On the following Sunday Elder Hyde preachedupon the ^parable of the^ 10 Virgins; I followed him but was somewhat tied.In the afternoon Lorenzo Snow and F. D. Richards spoke bothin the power of God. I followed and the Spirit of the Lordrested upon me and I asked the people which they would do go 
 to and get the power of God and sustain the Melchezedic Priesthood withthe First Presidency and Twelve or would they reject it and have thePresidency and Twelve and the Melchezedic Priesthood taken fromthem and only the Aaronic Priesthood govern them and the law ofcarnal commandments. The people must do one or the otherOn the 29^th^ Lorenzo Snow and myself went upto President Young's Office where we found him Heber C. Kimballand Orson Hyde. I Wilford Woodruff told President BrighamYoung that we had drawn up a few lines for the Presidents of theSeventies to sign. I also said to him that I would not askmy brethren to do what I was not willing to do myself and inasmuchas I received my Apostleship from yourse hands I now surrenderit unto you and throw myself into your hands and if there isany other man in Israel that you think will fill my placebetter than I do I will freely take it and not complain aboutit. Elder Lorenzo Snow said the same thing to President YoungSo also did Orson Hyde.President Young replied, "As for you brotherWoodruff and brother Snow I have never known you whenyou more felt the responsibility of your Apostleship or was as wellqualified to magnify your calling as at the present time; but asfor you brother Hyde I will say if you do not magnify yourcalling better than you have done I shall object to your standingwhere you do if nobody else does for you have not had the spiritof your calling upon you. You have been trying to buildyourselves up and not the Kingdom of God"I remarked yes brother Hyde the quorum of the Twelve feel this and have felt it for a good while. We wantyou to take hold and lead as you are our President. We want aleader and if you will magnify your calling we will be with youPresident Young also ^made^ some remarks upon Orson Pratt's course disaproaving of his philosophy and order of reasoning 
 I arose to go out and Brother Brigham said BrotherWoodruff are you going? Come dont be in a hurry. I shall bejealous of you. Does not the Spirit of God dwell here? I want mento stop here who has the Spirit of God. It rests me. I am crowdedall day with men and things which makes me weary.I replied I did not intend to be in a hurry. I had some appointments which I thought of attending "but I enjoy myselfhere and like to be here." So I sat down with my brethrentill meeting time and then with Orson Hyde and Lorenzo SnowI went to the Seventies Hall and found the Hall full andF. D. Richard's there making 4 of the Twelve PresentWe called upon the Presidents of the Seventiesto speak and all spoke and were followed by the Twelve whohad much of the Spirit and power of God and gave much goodinstruction. We also spoke our feelings to the Presidents ofthe Seventies concerning their surrendering their presidency tothe First Presidency of the Church.Baptism of the Legislative Body.Dec. the 30th 1856.I met with the Legislative Council in the forenoon. PresidentYoung was present and the Spirit of God was present. The ##John 15|XVChapter of St. John## was read and commented upon. It wasthen moved that both Houses meet in joint session. We thencame together and speeches were made by Lorenzo Snow WilfordWoodruff Brigham Young H. C. Kimball and Hosea StoutAmong the remarks made by President Youngwas that when the First Twelve were called he and brother Kimballalmost needed a stool in order to reach high enough to tie the shoes ofJohn Boyanton Lyman Johnson and Wm. E. McLellin but nowthey are gone and we remain. Brother Woodruff and LorenzoSnow say they never have felt the weight of their Apostleship and 
 responsibility as they do now. This I have known all thetime. If brother Hyde feels the weight of his responsibility as anApostle to day I am glad of it for it is the first day of his lifethat he ever did feel it.Many other remarks were made and it wasfinally moved that all the members of the Legislative body of theTerritory of Utah repent of their sins and go to the Font at 6 o'clockon the Temple Block and be baptized for the remission of theirsins which was carried unanimously.The Legislature met at the Font as orderedand they had to fill it with buckets from the Creek; and as thePresidency and those of the Twlelve at home had been baptized ElderFranklin Richards went into the water and baptized Elder OrsonHyde and some 17 others. Then James Cummings went into thefont and baptized some 37 the rest, also the missionaries 37 innumber.We the Twelve then laid hands upon Elder Orson Hydeand confirmed ^him^ Elder Orson Hyde, Wilford Woodruff was mouthThe Twelve also confirmed the whole company. I was mouthin confirming 9 persons and I assisted in confirming 12othersThis was a new feature in Legislation. We believedthat if we could get the Spirit of God we could do businessfaster and better than with the spirit of the devil or thespirit of the world. There were 55 in all baptized.On the last day of the year I met withPresident Young and the Twelve and the missionaries at theHistorian's Office and we heard the report of all the missionariesand a very interesting address from President Brigham Youngwho spoke in the power of God upon our enemies and saidthe Spirit of the Lord told him that inasmuch as he had delivered us through all our troubles thus far while 
 in the land of our enemies that if we would trust still to hHim and ^do^ ourduty the Lord would bless us and still deliver us and that we neednot have any fearsNote. The following to go into my Autobiography in the order of date.On the evening of the 22nd I attended the Seventiesmeeting. There were present of the Twelve Elder Orson Hyde WilfordWoodruff Lorenzo Snow and F. D. Richards. The first business thatwas attended to was the trial G. P. Stiles for adultery. He emphaticallydenied it though the testimony was strong against him. A P. Rockwoodwas in the stand and he did not know what to do with him. I boreit as long as I could and then I arose in the Stand and said:"George P. Styles, I am going to ask you aquestion and if you are i^in^nocent you shall proclaim your i^in^nocencebut if you are guilty dont you deny it before God the Holy Ghostand these witnesses. If you do the judgements of God shallfollow your footsteps from this hour till you go to your graveand from thence to hell."I put the question and he did not deny it noracknowledge it so he was cut off from the Church.All the members of the Twelve present then spokeand the power of God rested upon us like fire shut up in ourbones and many things were revealed to us. We advised thePresidents of the Seventies to go forward and present their resignationto President Young and let men take their places who couldmagnify the officeOn the following day I met in the LegislativeCouncil. There was no spirit to transact business. LorenzoSnow moved that President Kimball should give us an addressPresident Kimball said, "I do not feel muchlike speaking to day. I feel feeble in body and want my libertyto act as I am moved upon by the Holy Ghost.But he began to talk and the power of God 
 came upon him and he spoke for an hour. I followed him and theroom was filled as with consuming fire and all the members of thehouse came in and they all spoke until sundown and the housewas filled with the Spirit of God almost to the consuming of ourflesh and many things were revealed which were marvellousI attended the Bishops meeting in the eveningOrson Hyde W. Woodruff Lorenzo Snow and F. D. Richards of theTwelve were present and the fire of God was still with us. I never spent such a day and night in Israel before.Next day I reported to President Youngwhat we had done in relation to the Presidents of the Seventies andJudge Stiles in cutting him off for adultery and President Youngapproved of what we had done. He also told me to gothrough the city and remove all the stumbling blocks I could andwhere I found a Bishop or any other man who was in his way to remove him and put a better man in his place.SynopsisofThe Journal of Wilford Woodruff for 1856.Travels: I travelled four hundred and sixty four milesMeetings: I attended fifty five meetings and two GeneralConferences and met in the prayer circle withthe Presidency and Twelve twenty five timesOrdinationsConfirmationsBaptisms &cI baptized seven persons ordained ^confirmed^ two hundredand sixty eight; ordained one Elder andtwenty two Seventies and set appart and blessed one hundred and thirty Missionariesand administered to 11 sick persons.

The UtahExpedition. Burning of the U. S. Wagonsby Lot Smith's Company. &c.The new year came in with a tremendioussnow storm. I spent a good part of new year's daywith President Young and F. D. Richards. President Younggave us good counsel and wished us to become Saviors uponMount Zion and told us in what way that we might havea crown of glory in the eternal world.In the Historians Office on the 3rd^Note^ President Kimball said he did not believe in the custom of adoption that had been practised in this Church. No manshould give his birthright to another but should keep hisbirthright in the linage of his fathers and not give it to another go to and unite the link through the whole linageof their fathers until they come up to a man in the linage whoheld the Priesthood. The branch of a vine still abidesin the vine though it comes out of it. Unless thisthe vine is cutoff or the branch it will abide in it. A man shouldkeep his Priesthood and unite it with his fathers and not give 
 it to another and the Lord will save our fathers. Every man who getshis patriarchal blessing and Priesthood becomes the Patriarch of his ownfamily and he should bless his own family.I continued daily attending meetings and the LegislatureThe following isA Synopsis of President Young's RemarksIn the 18 Ward Jan. 11th 1857It is right that we should meet together often to pray sing preach andreceive instruction in order to assist us to live our religion; but noneof these things or any of the ordinances of the Gospel which we administerto the children of men or to each other benefit the Lord. Our worshipingthe Lord is no particular benefit to our Father in heaven; but it is allentirely for our own benefit and in this light we should view itThere is a doctrine taught from the Stand andfrequently taught in public that we should follow Brother Joseph orBrother Brigham or any man who leads and do as they say and obeythem and that is all that is required; but this is a false doctrine in onesense. For I will say no man should trust to the testimonyof another but he should go to ^God^ and get the testimony for himself.This every man and woman should do.I might have heard Joseph Smith preach andtestify of the truth of the Book of Mormon and this work until hehad been as old as Methuselah and in the end I should havesnaped my fingers at him and said to him you are a foolishold man and turned upon my heels and walked off if I hadnot have had some other testimony besides his; but I went to theLord and the Lord revealed to me that it was true and that it washis work and I received it upon that principle, I havelived upon that principle from that day to thisIt is the right privilege and duty of every manand woman to get the revelation of Jesus Christ for themselves and 
 every person should get the Spirit of God and live by it and if allwould do this there would not be a man ^or woman^ unhappy in this Territory andthe flood of complaint which now salute my ears of husbands and wivescomplaining of each other would be done awayOne man comes and says my family will notbe subject to me. Another woman says my husband abusesme and I want a bill to get away from him and a thousand complaintscome pouring in upon me none of which I should hear if the peoplelived by the Spirit of God. You should all obtain the Spirit of God and overcome your passions.When you get angry you should put a pieceof Indian rubber in your mouth and bite it until you could get perfect control over your passions. Do not speak while youare angry for you will say something that you will be sorry forbut if you will keep your thoughts to yourself when you are angryThey will not become the property of another.Any person who is acquainted with me knowsthat I have control over myself. I do not speak in anger tomy wives children or the people. I make all my passions bein subjection to the priesthood and the Spirit of GodPeople cannot fulfil their calling anddo their duty unless they are filled with the Holy Ghost. I donot know that there is a female in Israel worthy of the appellationof a Mother in Israel. For any women to raise up childrenunto the Lord as they should do they should do they shouldbe filled with the Holy Ghost when they conceive and continue filledwith the Holy Ghost until the child is born and weaned and thenthe mother should have the Holy Ghost to teach the child untilhe is grown up.So the father should be filled with the HolyGhost when he begets a child and he also should be filledwith the Holy Ghost in order to train up that child right 
 that it will be holy unto the Lord and will have power with God. Theseare true principles.The Saints should bring all their passions in subjectionto the laws of God.I am learning every day I live. I see some whowill bear testimony that they know that Joseph was a Prophet and theBook of Mormon true and that this is the work of God; and yetif anything is said which comes contrarry to their selfish dispositionsthey will manifest the most stuborn will and will not move one hairfrom what their wicked dispositions dictate. I see it in families.One will growl because one drops a mop at their door or does somethingthat does not please them. They have no disposition to do anythingonly for their own gratification; but this is not right. Youshould feel like this: What can I do to help you? I am notabove helping my neighbor. Do you want your shoes blacked?I will black them. I am not too good to do it.This is the way you should feel for theLord will reward you according to your workThere are many in this Territory who aremiserable. Why? Because they have not the Spirit of GodThey do wrong and get into the dark but no person should bemiserable who has received the Holy Ghost. They shouldbe happy all the time—day and night.On Sunday the 1st of Feb. the Tabernacle wasfilled to overflowing. While A. Cordon was speaking H. C.Kimball came in and soon after President Young whose comingcreated quite a sensation among the people for it was the firsttime he had been seen in the Tabernacle since the day thatJ. M. Grant was buried. Brother Cordon soon stopedand President Young arose and addressed the people for aboutone hour and a half and he spoke in great plainness of thethings of the Kingdom of God. 
 On Sunday the 8th in the prayer circle PresidentYoung in speaking of a blank in the History said that it was duringthat time in the fall and Winter of 1844 that Sidney Rigdon preachedhis great sermon when he was going to take Queen Victoria by thenose. We did a good deal of work at the time on theTemple and it was difficult to get bread for the hands to eatI told the people or the committee who had charge of the Temple meansto deal out all the flour they had and God would give them moreand they did so. And it was but a short time before BrotherToronto came and brought me twenty five hundred dollars in gold. The committee and the Bishop met and I met withthem and they said that the law was to lay the gold at theApostles' feet. Yes I said and I will lay it at the Bishop'sfeet: so I opened the mouth of the bag and took hold of the bottomend and gave it a jerk towards the Bishop and strewed thegold across the room at his feet. I said now go and buyflour for the workmen on that Temple and dont distrust theLord any more for we will have what we need.On the 9th my father Aphek Woodruffwas taken sick with the Billious cholic and continued veryill for some days and I thought he was ^striken with^ taken for deathbut he recoveredOn the following Sunday after a pleasing discoursefrom George Sims Aropene the Utah chief delivered a powerfuldiscourse and exhorted the Saints in the strongest manner tofollow their leaders and do right and not drink wiskeyor do wrong in anything.I spoke after him and told the peopleto lay that exhortation to heart as it was given by a Lamanitechief.On the 17th in company with F. D. Richards I calledupon President Young and asked him what I should do where 
 counsel was asked of me either by the Seventies or Bishops. Joseph Youngsaid to the quorums of the Seventies that when they were called to be Bishops or Councillors that they might still retain their place as Presidentsof the Seventies and not be ordained High Priests. Bishop Hunterthinks they should be ordained Bishops and High Priests. What shall I do about it?President Young said that if they would go there andhold their tongues about it they might stand as they are and act ascouncillors to a Bishop; but if they will not, ordain them.I said I thought men ought to walk in the channelpointed out for them and not complain about it. President Youngsaid, "Yes; let them do as they are told."I attended the Bishops' meeting in the eveningBishop Hunter spoke and I followed himI told the Bishops to impress upon the minds of thepeople the necessity of living their religion after this date for if thepeople again commit sin after being forgiven as they now werethey would not again be forgiven but the justice of the lawwould be brought against them and they would have to pay thepenelty or be cut off from the ChurchAgain I told them they should not boast of theirauthority and power or that a Seventy was greater than a HighPriest or a High Priest greater than a Seventy. No man shouldboast of the power of the priesthood until he obtained some of thatpower and it was manifested upon him and when that was upon him he certainly would not boast of it, for the HolySpirit would teach him sense enough to know better.It is very seldom that I have known the powerof the Priesthood made manifest upon the children of men inour day to a very great degree; but in some instances itwas as in the case of the Prophet Joseph at the time hewas full of the sick and dying at his door-yard and they 
 were strewed along the bank of the river for two miles andJoseph rose up and shook himself like an old lion and commencedat his tent door and healed all the people who were not dead,on both sides of the river, by the power of God and his voicewas as the voice of God and the earth almost trembled under hisfeet as he went along commanding the sick to arrise and be madewhole.It was also manifest with Joseph while in prison and in chains in Missouri and his ungodly wicked persecutorsgathered around him and while he was fast in chains withhis brethren yet they goaded his feelings by boasting of howmany murders they had committed and rapes upon Mormonwomaen and how they had cut the Mormons to pieces andthen they would blaspheme the name of God until his spiritwas reined up and he rose up in the power of God in the midstof his chains and spoke as in a voice of thunder:"Silence ye fiends of the pit! I willnot live another moment and hear such vile language frommortals. Either you are ^or^ I shall die right here or else youshall cease from boasting of such damnable deeds as youare guilty of.They quailed before him ^his words^ like leather wiltingin the flames and they bowed before him and made acknowledgmentsto him. This was done by the power of God.Again David Patten was taken by anarmed mob under a United States warreant and when hewas surrounded by this armed mob of about 40 men underthe garb of law and who would not let him say a word inhis own defence he arose in the power of God and held themfast to their seats until he had addressed them about halfan hour. He told them they were cowards rascals andvillains and he proved it to them and they had not power 
 to harm a hair of his head and they let him and Warren Parrish goaway.Again this power was manifested by President Brigham Young on the Banks of the Missouri River at Winter Quarters when the merchantsbrought up goods to sell to the brethren who were going to the MountainsOld Major Miller the Indian Agent was surrounded by officers andMiller in order to show his great power told the merchants who ownedsome Alkahol not to roll a barrel off from the boat or he would knockthe head in and spill it upon the ground.President Young steped up and told the mento roll it out and if Miller spilled it "that moment I will spill hisclarrel."Miller and all the officers turned pale and the liquor wasrolled out and nobody hurt.Other instances might be named when the power of thePriesthood has been manifest but these men have never boastedof it and never will.On the 21st I carried to President Young's office a donation from the Fourteenth Ward Female Relief Society to the PoorFund quilts and cloathing amounting to $126On the 23rd I went to President Kimball and read himhis history. He did not think it full enoughI spent the 28th in compiling the Life and History ofSamuel H. Smith. I also wrote two letters to Orson PrattAmasa Lyman and Charles C. Rich and one to Phineas Youngrequesting them all to forward us a brief history of their lives. Ifound it a great difficulty to obtain information concerning SamuelH. Smith in any history or JournalMy Fiftieth YearMarch the 1st 1857I was fifty years old on this birthday. I had been preserved 
 unto this age through the mercy of my Heavenly Father. I had manytimes during my life been snatched from the jaws of death by the powerof God and I had lived to see much of the power of God manifestedand much of his work displayed upon the earth. The last 23years I had spent in his kingdom and travelled and preached theGospel of Jesus Christ, and built up churches to his name; and Iprayed that the rest of my life might be devoted to his serviceand that I might do the will of God in all thingsImportant Items fromPresident Youngs Discourse.On Sunday the 8th of March President Young preached oneof the most comforting and interesting discourses ever delivered to thepeople. He said if we pass our inspection before Joseph we probably should Peter and Jesus. That we should be quitesafe. If all this people did not go to a celestial kingdomit would be their own fault; but will all have the same exaltationand glory in the celestial kingdom? By no means. Therewill be but few who go there who will be crowned kings andpriests and Gods. There will be many millions in thecelestial kingdom who will not be exalted to those higherblessings. This people are a good ^people^ and they are advancingfaster than any other people who ever lived. It would notbe 120 years instead of 365 before this^ey^ people would with theportion of earth they occupy be seperated from the whole of the wickedThe Lord will bless this people and if you will do as well as youknow how all will be well with you.President Young made many glorious remarks.At the Prayer Circle in the evening the President had Orson Pratt'spamplet entitled the Holy Spirit read; and upon it President Youngsaid that Brother Pratt had got beyond the stars. He hadcorrelled them and got beyond them.The President asked Wm W. Phelps by what 
 authority he had proclaimed in public that he, Brigham Young, was the manthat the Lord said he would raise up like unto Moses. [##Deuteronomy 18:18##]Phelps said "Joseph is gone and you are left to leadthe people.Brigham Young: "That is no argument at all. I might die andand others be left. That does not prove that I or they would be the onereferred to. If I thought I was the man I would not tell of it. But I think I am the great man that none of the Prophets ever thought of orspoke of.Orson Hyde said that a man in Provo professed tohave a visit from a departed spirit. He comes to him dressedin his temple robes and the man he comes to has not had hisendowments. I want to know what you think of it. I thoughtthe whole of it smelt strongly of brimstonePresident Young answered, "Now if thepeople in Provo can be made to beleive that that is a true visitabout the third time he comes he will say that this Church isnot led by the man who ought to lead the Church. ^but the man who has this visit will tell you that he is to lead the Church^ Now Iwill tell you how you may know it is a false. A spiritwill not come to a man in the flesh without he appears in hisglory and man cannot endure his glory; a resurrected bodymay come and hide his glory; but that visitation is false.It is not true"On the following Sunday President Youngsaid to Elder Orson Hyde at the Prayer Circle, "You have beento both Jerusalem and Zion and seen both. I have not seeneither for I never have been in Jackson County. Now itis a plesant thing to think of to know where the odld Garden of Eden is. Did you ever think of it or sense it. I donot think many do. Now Jackson County is the Gardenof Eden. Joseph has declared this and I am as much boundto believe it as much as I am to beleive that Joseph is a Prophet 
 of God. Many in Jackson County have found out thatthey cannot cultivate the Temple Block and other places in that countyWe must let the Lord take his own time to prepare the way forour return to that County to build up that TempleJoseph's Charge to the TwelveAt a Bishop's meeting on the 17th I made the followingremarks:There is another subject which I wish to speak of. BrotherHunter said that he wanted the clerk to keep a record of theirmeetings as it would make a good history. This is a subject Ihave always felt interested in and as there are many branches inthe Kingdom of God so there should be some person engaged in eachbranch.I have spoken upon the subject of Journal writingand keeping a history of what transpires within us from day to dayI was deeply impressed with the importance of reading the history of theorganization of the quorum of the Twelve and the remarks of the ProphetJoseph upon the subject: he said,"I have for myself learned a fact by experiencewhich on reflection gives me much sorrow. It is a truth that ifI now had in my possession every decission which has been givenupon important items of doctrine and duties since the rise of thisChurch they would be of incalculable worth to the Saints; butwe have neglected to keep a record of such things thinking perhapsthat they never would benefit us afterwards which had we nowwould decide any point that might be agitated; and now wecannot bear record unto the Church ^nor unto the world^ of the great and glorious manifestationsthat have been made to us with that degree of power and authoritywhich we otherwise could if we had those decissions to publishabroad. 
 through his posterity forever wherever the kingdom of God existed. Thenlet every child for the future be begotten in holiness and rememberthis one thing—live your religionI now want to speak of another thing. A smallportion of our time was spent in the Temple at Nauvoo where we began to administer the ordinances according to the words of ##Malachi 4:5-6|Malachiin the 4 chapter 5th and 6th verses##—"Behold I will send you Elijahthe Prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord; and he shall turn the hearts of the Fathers to the childrenand the hearts of the children to the Fathers lest I come and smitethe earth with with a curse"Abraham received a promise from the Lordthat his seed should be saved and all the seed of Abrahamamong the Gentile nations or among the uncontaminated of the house of Israel will be gathered. They have sinnedthey have changed the ordinances and broken their covenants or you would not see the children of these mountains inthe degredation in which we now find themThe Lamanites upon this continent areManassahites almost excluseively. There is but little of the seed of Ephraim among them. They are accounted as thee Seed of Abraham ^and they must be saved^ or they would not have becomeso loathsome as they are. They are punished in the flesh to make an atonement in the flesh for their sinsand transgressions and when they pass through the veil the enemy will leave no power over themIn the day of the Lord Jesus Christ allthe particles of the blood of Abraham will be gathered together The seed of Abraham has not been counted for many yearsand never will be again. If an angel was to commence now tonumber them all, [illegible]when [illegible]he had got the numbers together, beforethey could be computed there would be a great number more 
 born during the time of their numeration so they could not benumbered and this is the reason why his seed cannot be numberedBrethren and Sisters you are of theseed of Abraham and you should live your religion that you mayclaim the promises of AbrahamThis Priesthood will turn the hearts ofthe children to the Ancient Fathers and the Fathers to the childrennow, and those which are to come will be made perfect. Thischain must not be broken for mankind cannot be savedany other way. The Priesthood must be linked togetherso that all the children may be linked to Father AdamIt may be asked "When will thiswork be done? It will be done in temples in our dayand in the days of our children. We shall go into theTemples and be pillars therein and go no more out; and we shallplant trees and vineyards and eat the fruit thereof. I wall callit the Millennium. I carry it in my heart. I say it hasbegun. Every Saint carries carries it with himThen let us increase in every good thingand we shall extend this influence from Zion until it rootsout every evil and brings all in subjection to the Kingdomof our God.We will administer in the Temple which wehave now begun and that is one point gained and we willseal man to man by the keys of the Holy Priesthood. Thisis the highest ordinance. It is the last ordinance of theKingdom of God on the earth and above all the endowments thatcan be given you. It is a final sealing—an eternal principleand when once made cannot be broken by the DevilWhen we return to Zion and buildthe great Temple which Joseph Saw, and the centre ofZion is established the glory of God will rest upon it by 
 Since the Twelve are now chosen I wish to tell them a coursewhich they may pursue and be benefited hereafter in point of light of which they perhaps are not awareAt all times when you assemble in the capacity of a Council to transact buisness let the oldest of your number preside and let one or more be appointed to keep a record of your proceedings and on the decission of every important item let it be what it may let us ^such^ decesion be noted down and they will ever afterwards remain upon record as lawcovenant and docrtrine. Questions thus decided might at the time appear unimportant, but should they be recorded and one of you lay hands upon them afterwards you might find them of infinite worth not only to your brethren but a feast also to your own soulsShould you assemble from time to time and procedeto discuse important subjects or questions and pass descisions upon them and omit to record such decisions by and by you will be driven to straits from which you will not be able to extricate yourselves not being in a position situation to bring your faith to bear with sufficient perfection or power to obtain the desired information.Now in consequence to write of a neglect to write thesethings when God revealed them not esteeming them of sufficient worth the Spirit may withdraw and God may be angry. And here is a fountain of intelligence or knowledge of infinite importance which is lost. What was the cause of this? The answer is slothfulness or neglect to appoint a man to occupy a few moments in writing.Here let me prophesy the time will come when if youneglect to do this you will fall by the hands of unrighteous men. Were you to be brought before the authorities and accused of any crime or misdemienor and be as innocent as the angels of God unless you can prove that you were somewhere else your enemies willprevail against you; but if you can bring twelve men to testify 
 day and by night and those who are prepared will see the face of the Sonof Man and they will see Joseph and Hyrum in the flesh in theirresurrected bodies. Then will the armies of Israel be terrible to allnations; then will ^one^ chase a thousand and two put ten thousand to flightWho will resurrect Joseph's body? It willbe Peter James John Moroni or some one who has or who will receivethe keys of the resurrection. It will probably be one of thosewho holds the keys of this dispensation and has delivered them toJoseph. And you will see Jesus and he will eat peaches andapples with you but the world will not see it or know it forwickedness will increase. Joseph and Jesus will be there. Theywill walk and talk with them at times and no man mistrust whothey are.Joseph will lead the armies of Israel whether he isseen or not, whether visible or invisible as seemeth him good. Joseph has got to receive the keys of the resurrection for you and I.After he is resurrected he will go and resurrect brother BrighamBrother Heber and brother Carlos, and when that is done he will saynow go brother Brigham and resurrect your wives and childrenand gather them together. While this is done the wicked willknow nothing of it though they will be in our midst and theywill be struck with fear. This is the way the resurrectionwill be. All will not be raised at once; but it willcontinue in this way until all the righteous are resurrectedAfter Joseph comes to us in his resurrectedbody he will more fully instruct us concerning the baptismfor the dead and sealing ordinances. He will say bebaptized for this man and that man; and that man be sealed to thatman and such a man to such a man and connect the Priesthoodtogether.I tell you there will not be much of this doneuntil Joseph comes. He is our Spiritual Father: our hearts 
 are already turned to him and his to usThis is the order of the Holy Priesthoodand we shall continue to administer in the ordinances of thekingdom of God here on earth. Joseph will not officiate inthis low capacity any more: neither did Jesus, A^a^fter hisresurrection. If so he would have baptized Saul; buthe was exalted above the earth and he told Saul to go toa certain man in a certain street and he would administer tohim the ordinances upon the earthI say to you dont hurry in theordinances. Dont do what you ought not. It is notthe time to hurry. We should not undertake to do nowwhat we ought to do fifty years hence. What have weto do to day^?^ Purify your hearts that you mayreceive the manifestation of the Spirit of GodWhen you sow your wheat youprepare the ground and then sow your wheat and watchit till the harvest. It is just so in the PriesthoodYou will be just as busy as you can be to do the thingswhich are to be done to dayNow dont be in a hurry. I saywe are going to have time enough. I say I will be hereon earth to do all I can; and after I die and get my bodyagain (my resurrected body) I mean to come back to the earthagain and fight the devils and be here at the winding-upscene. I want to see righteousness prevail and theSaints have peace on the earth.I wish now to speak upon anothersubject. I am here as the Governor of this Territoryand I wish to comme^e^nd^ce^ my remarks upon this subject with the President of the United States. Is he the Masterof the United States? No he is not. He is selected 
 that you were in some other place at that time you will escape their hands Now if you will be careful to keep minutes of these things as I have said it will be one of the most important and interesting records ever seen. I have now laid these ^things before your^ consideration and you are left to act according to your own judgement." (See Record of the Twelve and History of the Church Feb1835; Historians Office)I have thus referered to some of the words of Josephto the Twelve Apostles at their organization. This shows the feelings of the Prophet Joseph upon the subject.I have had this same subject upon my mind ever sinceI have been a member of the Church. I have been inspired and movedupon my mind ever since I have been in the Church. I have been inspired and moved upon to keep a Journal and write the affairs of this Church as far as I can. I did not understand why my feelings were exercised so much in the early age of this Church; but I understand it now.I seldom ever heard Brother Joseph or the Twelve preach or teach any principle but what I felt as uneasy as a fish out of water until I had written it. Then I felt right. I could write a sermon of Joseph's a week after it was delivered and almost word for word and after it was written it was taken from me or from my mind This was a gift from God unto me and I have kept a Journal of almost every day of my life for the last 24 years. I could tell each day what I had done what company I was in and what was transpiring around me and any teachings or counsels from the Presidency of the Church except where I knew the reporters had written their discourses I have urged the same course upon the Twelve and all the quorums of the Church to keep a record of their meetings and the dealings of God with them and for all men who hear the Priesthood to keep a record of their lives especially of all their official acts in the Church and kingdom of GodYou may say that this is a great deal of 
 to sit there as one of our servants to act for us and to do what we wishto have done. So it is with the Congress and the Governors of theseveral States and I am here as one of them as the Servant of thepeopleCongress has p^repared^ a Constitution for this Territory whichthey call the organic act and have granted certain rights to this peopleas a community. They have said this Territory should beorganized thus and so with a Governor and Legislative Assemblyand the right is given to the people to elect twenty six Representativesand thirteen councillors ann[u]ally. This body may enact lawsto control each of us and all the inhabitants of this Territoryincluding the Governor the Judges the Secretary the SupremeCourt the District Court and the Probate Court. They have saidthey shall have all the power given to them by the LegislativeAssembly.We have a Legilaslative Assembly and Majestratescourts. Congress will send certain men to hold SupremeCourts and send other men as officers to the Territory of Utahto transact business for the Territory of Utah so as to make it aseasy as possible.The United States Judges are not here as Kingsor Monarchs but as servants of the people and when you see aJudge putting a city under "martial law" he manifests boyismand you should pity him and give him a piece of cakeIf a man wants to be what he is not it iscertain that he wants to get out of his sphere. When somemen know a hundred words they think they know all of WebsterSome will try to study a hundred sciences of the day andthen know no more than a child. When a man studiesDivinity five years he is only fit to be put down uponthe ground as a block to stand upon to get upon yourhorses. 
 I see some here who have come fifty orone hundred miles at the squaling of a goose crow and dont youknow that if you want a court held there that the Judges should go there and hold it? aAnd if a Judge dont know that it is becausehe is very ignorant and he ought to learn his dutyI am perfectly astonished at these, my brethren, to think that if a man takes a pumpkin and saysit is an apple you must acknowledge it is an apple andswallow it as such or if they take a rotton potatoe and say itis a peach and cram it down your throat as a peach. Whenyou see a rotton potatoe why dont you acknowledge it to be arotton potatoeNow I say to you jurimen and witnessespack up your deeds and go home and stay there till you havebusiness. If I come here and act the tyrant instead ofa Governor you ought to kick me out and all officers oughtto be served in the same way when they get out of theirplace and act the fool or else let the people swallow therotton potatoe and call it a peachI know the meaning the marrowand the pith of the laws and the very principle upon whichthey are built much better than the Judges do. I knowthe meaning of them and the duty of all the officers in thisTerritory. I say this for your instructionTo see men come here at the callof a foolish boy fre[e]zing your toes and killing your horsesin the cold month of December is foolishness. When you want him send for him and pay your respects to him.They do not understand the law. WhenI see Lawyers and Judges rise up here and saying that our lawsare not right and we should not be governed by themit puts me in mind it puts me in mind of the anecdote 
 trouble. Very well. It has been so to me in one sense. It has occupied nearly every leasure moment of my time for 24 years. But what of it? I have never spent any of my time more profitably for the benefit of mankind than in my Journal writing for a great portion of the Church History has been compiled from my Journals and some of the most glorious Gospel sermons truths and revelations that were given from God through ^to^ this people through the mouths of the Prophets Joseph Brigham Heber and the Twelve could not be found upon the earth on record only in my Journals and they are compilled in the Church History and transmitted to the Saints of God in all future generations. Does not this pay me for my trouble? It does.In many instances in this Church men have been appointed clerks to write for the Church and they have kept the records instead of delivering them to the President of the Church to whom they belonged and soon they would apostatize and then they would insult the Church by offering to sell them their own records at an enormous price.I have deposited my records and Journals in the Historians Office where I hope they may do some goodWe have had a very interesting time this Winter during the Reformation among the Latter-day Saints. The spirit and power of God have been poured out in a wonderful manner and many glorious truths have been revealed through the Presidency aTwelves and others and in various quorums meetings. Now should not there be a record kept of those things? In the commencement of these meetings the clerks took quite full reports but thinking it too much trouble they now thake them very short and we can hardly get an outline of the real facts of our meetings and the power of God and the dealings of God with usEvery man should keep a brief history of hislife his parentage his birth his religion when he was baptized and by whom; when he was ordained and by whom and what to 
 of the fox that went to the hencoop to catch some chickens. The ownerhad put a cord from the platform to a bell overhead so that as soonas the platform was touched the bell would ring. As soon as thefox jumped on to the platform the bell rang and away the fox ranwith all his might but on looking behind him he saw nothing so hewent back to the coop and examined to see what the matter wasHe touched the cord with his foot and the bell rang but did nothurt so he jumped into the coop and got his chickens. He lookedup and saw that the bell was hollow and had a long tongue andthe fox exclaimed "You are a poor miserable hollow-headed devil."Lawyers and Judges should be made tokeep the laws of this Territory as well as other citizens and if theywont do it put them in the way that they will be made to; andif I say to every man who has no business here pack up your goodsand go home: let the Judges honor me and our laws and the officersof this Territory or they will not receive any honor from meI see one man on my right who will gostraight and tell the Judges what I have said. He is a kindof perpetual telegraph and if any man comes to me and saysBrother Brigham do you mean me^?^ I will say you are the man.(alluding to Elisha Hoopes)Speech of Kn^a^osh the Indian Chief ^of the Parvans^On the 16th in the afternoon K^a^nosh delivered to us a speechThe following are some of his remarks"I am just beginning to get my eyes openI know that President Young's talk is good. What he saysis so. He tells us more good. I am like the sun justrising in the East and so with my people. We have beenin the night. I have had eyes but I could not see andears but I could not hear; and this has been the case with 
 my people: our hearts could not understand; but now our eyessee our ears hear and our hearts understand. All thatBrigham and Heber has said is straight; but when I talked to Col. Steptoe and his men their talk was not straight. Icould not believe for a tenth part of their talk is not trueand so with the Spaniards and all white men till I saw theMormons. They are the first to tell ^me the^ truthYou are here to make laws. I hopeyou will make good laws to punish the guilty and spare theinnocent.I wish to do right and have my people do rightI do not whant them to steel nor kill. I want to plant andraise wheat and learn to plough and do as the white peopleThis I am going to do in the Spring. I want to learn toread and write and have my children; so that we can understandwhat you say to us that is good"On the 18th the Legislature met atthe State House and adjourned till ^the 2nd^ Monday ^in^ December theAfter adjournment the Governor and all the Northernmembers and Judges started for home and arrived in GreatSalt Lake City on the 21stMass MeetingIn Great Salt Lake CityJanuary the 26th 1856According to the adjournment at Filmore a mass meetingof the people conveined in the Tabernacle for the purpose oftaking into consideration the propriety of establishinga daily express and passenger communication ^between^ the WesternStates and California. The meeting was organized 
 and Charles C Rich return to the seat of war and take charge of the commandThe following is a synopsis of a conversation of PresidentYoung. He said:"If any officers come to the army—the Governor or Judges andsend word that they want to come in just inform them that they are as nearas they can come. Had they have come without a military araray theycould have come and not have been molested but now they cannot comeWe will not have any cursed scoundrel forced upon us to judge or ruleover us and they shall not come among usIf Johnson comes with troops and intends to comein I expect they will leave their baggage battary and a company to guardit and come in on a forced march without it. Then we must not letthem sleep but use them ^up^ us as soon as we can. Work night and dayand not let them sleep. Brother Wells thinks they are determinedto come in. I have sent word that if General Harney is on hisway to get into camp and kill him if possible and take the the animalsfrom Johnson if possible and take charge of the goods train. PresidentYoung said I am glad of one thing; ie, this thing will be just asthe Lord wants it. If he wants them to come and get killedit will be so. If he wants them to go North South or East hewill have it just as he wants and this I am thankful for and I feelperfectly easy about it all.You will find that when the Lord sees that weare willing to fight and get just ready to shoot that he will fight ourbattles. He said George A Smith may stop in the city thistime. Let Charles C Rich go. He is a good General and a wiseman in calculation. I reckon a good deal upon him in thefuture.On the next day the 29 General D. H. Wells with hiscompanions left the city to take command of the Expedition inthe mountains and the company of cavalry commanded by HeberKimball also went out. 
 He should give a brief sketch of all his missions and of all his official acts and the dealings of God with him. Then if he was to die and the historians wished to publish his history they would have something to go by.Many think that this is a dry subject and unimportant but it is not so to me. I am now trying to get up a history of the Twelve Apostles as first organized. Half of them are now out of the Church and scarcely any record left whereby I can get a correct knowledge of their history in the ministry of this work and some of those who remain and are laboring to build up theKingdom of God have not kept a record of their missions ministry official acts and edecissions upon important subjects and the gifts graces and dealings of God with them sufficient to give a trueand correct history of their livesThere are but a few aside from the Presidency of the Church who feel the importance of this subject sufficient to put it into practice. The majority think the matter not important; but I believe it is otherwise.The Prophets would not have been moved upon to exhort us to faithfulness upon this subject had it not been important. The Lord has told us that what we seal on earth shall be sealed in heaven and what we record on earth shall be recorded in heaven and what is not sealed or recorded on earth is not sealed or recorded in heaven. Therefore it appears to be very important that we do keep a true and faithful record in all things.While walking in a rapid stream we cannot tread twice in the same water neither can we spend twice the same time. When we pass out of that door the work of this meeting will be closed to us forever. We shall never ^again^ spend the time of this evening Then should we not keep a record of our work teachings and counsels which we give in this meeting? We should.

GrantJudge Kenney Leonard W. Hardy O. P. Rockwell and closedwith a lengthy good speech from Governor Young.The 6, 7, 8 and 9th I spent mostly up till 10o'clock at night in President Young's Office in company witheBrothers Watt and Samuel Richards in making the manuscriptfor the First Reader to be published in the Deseret AlphabetI spent some time in scearching other books for matter but mymind was ledd to choose finally our own experience travels incidentshistory doctrines and our location and we commenced to writeupon these subjects.Sunday followed and on the Monday weresumed our work upon this matter of the Reader and theDeseret Alphabet. In the evening the committee met withthe Regency at the President's upper room and the work of thecommittee was read and accepted. Another Committee 
 of Revision was appointed to ^assist^ us the first Committee. They were AlbertCarrington Daniel H. Wells and W. WillisIn a prayer circle on Sunday the 17th PresidentYoung asked Orson Pratt what he thought of his preaching thatintelligent beings would continue to learn to all eternity.Orson Pratt replied that he believed the Gods hada knowledge at the present time of everything that did or will exist tothe endless ages of all eternity. He believed it as much as any truthhe had ever learned in or out of the ChurchPresident Young remarked that he had never learnedthat principle in the Church; for it was not true: it was falsedoctrine; for the Gods and all intelligent beings would never ceaseto learn except it were the Sons of Perdition: they would continueto decrease until they became dissolved back into their nativeelement and lose their identityOn the evening of the same day Parley P.Pratt preached a good discourse in the 14th Ward. He told theBishop to cut off all the liars thieves adulterers and profane swearersfrom the Church for they would rot the body if they continuedon it. He said many wicked men would stick by theChurch but they would never repent of their sins. There wasa time when man could repent but when that time was pastmen might pray till their knees where [were] callaced and they couldnot get the Spirit of God. How long did the people whowere destroyed in the flood have to wait before they couldhave the offer of the Srpirit of God or the Gospel? Theyhad to wait more than two thousand years, till after Christcame and was crucified. He then went and preached to the"Spirits in Prison." The Gospel was then offered unto them.And how has it been with the Jews. They once saw theday when the Gospel was offered unto them but whenthey put to death their King and Saviour the Gospel 
 Again Elders go forth upon missions to the nations of the earth They have to enter into a regular warefare. The Lord pours out his Holy Spirit upon them and they war with the world the flesh and the devil, with kings princes lords presidents and rulers. They are cast into prison and the Lord delivers them. The devil enters into some of their converts and they lay hands upon them and cast them out. The Saints are sick and they heal them. They prophesy in the name of the Lord and their words come to pass. Rulers declair that they shall not preach to the people on pain of death. They preachthe word of God and many believe obey and rejoice in the Lord and they are protected by the power of God. They goes upon the sea and the storms rage and the^y^ calms them water and wind in the name of the Lord. They are shielded and goverened by the angels of God all the day long and they know the power of God is with them revealing unto them the evilsthat lie in their path.And yet the Elders do not view these great and important things of value enough to make a record of them to spend a short time in writing them; and the circumstanceand history of these blessings unto them are lost both to the present and the future generations. Are these things right? I do not believe they are. I do not believe men are justified in neglecting to record these thingsNow as an example: Should the ten lost tribes of Israel suddenly come pouring down upon us in the land of Zion led by the Holy Prophets of God what would be one of the first enquiries we should make of them? It would be where are your records and History and the revelations and dealings of God with you since you were led away under Shalmaezar king of Asyria? O do let me see and read them and do let me have the journal of your travels from the North country to our land of Zion 
 On the 3rd of Nov. an express arrived and broughta letter from Col. Alexander thanking Governor Young for sending himhis prisoners and saying that he should send back those he held onlyhe had a civil process against them. Probably his intention was tohang them for treason.Vision Of Angels In the Temple of KirtlandRelated by President YoungNov 8thIn our prayer circle on this Sunday President Young related thecircumstance of the brethren seeing a circle of about 40 persons dressedin white robes and caps in the upper room of the Temple Kirtlandduring the Spring of 1835 after the endowments. There wasno person in the room at the time who was mortal yet the roomwas filled with light and many personsages appeared clothed in whiteand frequently went to the windows and looked out so that the brethrenin the streets could see them plainly. Brother Young and TrumanO Angel stood together in the street and looked at them. W. W.Phelps says he saw them for 3 hours. They were visible by allthe brethren present. Brother Angel said they must have stoodsome two feet from the floor as they were only the size of commonmen. They could not have been seen from the place wherethey stood except it had been the head and those personagesappeared nearly down to the waist as they looked out of windowwith a front viewCol. Johnson's Arrival in CampCol Albert S. Johnson commander ^had^ arrived in the camp ofthe main army and on the night of the 8th an express arrivedin the city with the news and the fact that the calvary was advancingupon Bridger under a gallop and our picket guard had to run 
 was taken from them and given to the Gentiles. It was also given to the Lamanites and the Ten Tribes of Israel. The first wereto be last and the last first. It will now come to the Gentilesfirst then to the ten tribes of Israel and the Lamanites before itwill go to the Jews: they will be the last to receive it. Who hasever heard of the Jews having the Spirit of God or the Gospel or Kingdomof God offered to the Jews since they put to death Jesus Chirist andthe Kingdom went to the Gentiles? No one for it has never beendone. They will go home in unbelief and wickedness andrebuild Jerusalem in that state and they will be so far from theGospel that when the Gentiles come against them to battle rifletheir houses ravish their women and carry half of their city intocaptivity and Jesus Christ comes and delivers them in the midstof this hour of peril and trouble they will not know him noreven imagine who he is till they ask him about his woundsand he tells them. Then the Gospel has to be preached tothem and they will repent be baptized and receive the firstprinciples of the GospelParley also said there was a promisethat the Three Nephites and angels should visit the Lamanitesbut they could not be sent to them to receive with messages toreceive and obey the Mormons until all the Mormon Missionarieswere righteous men and would not steal lie sware or commitadultary for if the angels were to tell them to obey theMormons and and they found the Mormons to do wickedlythey would lose confidence in both the angels and theMormonsOn Sunday the 24 President Brigham Youngtook up the subject of the Courts as held in Great Salt LakeCity and also the ungodly course of the lawyers. He cursed themin the name of the Lord with a great curse and all Israelsaid Amen. He called Zerubable Snow by name and he 
 And what would be our disapointment should their Prophets and Elders say, O we have not got any history of the dealings of God with us nor any journal of our travels. We used to hear our fathers say that there had been great and mighty things done in the land where we lived. The Saviour came and taught great and marvellous thingsand we had a glorious time in coming here. We smote the rocks and the mighty mountains of ice fell down with a great noise and great miracles were wrought but our fathers had so much to do and we have had so much to do that we never had any time to write anything about it and we did not think that any body would have any interest in it but ourselves, and so we did not writeShould we not be greatly disappointed? We should; and so with them if they should ask us for our records and say that Jesus and the angels told us that you were building up Zion and doing a great work in the earth and that great and glorious things were revealed unto you and we now wish to read those things. an And should we tell them that we had done as they had not kept a record of any of these things, they would be like ourselves much disappointed. But if they and ourselves should both keep a strict account of all that is useful then it would add great joy to both thayt [they] and us. Then let us lay these things to heart and keep a true and faithful record that we may be justified before God.On Monday the 23rd I dedicated the new font in the 14th Ward for baptizing and at the close of the dedication prayer Franklin D. Richards went into the font and baptized his father and about 40 others. I went into the School House and assisted in confirming 14. Samuel Richards was mouth in confirming his father. The Elders continued to baptize and confirm members of the 14th Ward throughout the day.I continued my labors in the Historians Office till as usual which filled up the interval to Conference

Several of theIndians had been killed and wounded.I was 49 years old on the 1st of March 1856The Indian war continued three more of the brethrenhad been killed.

He was deadI received a mission from President Youngon the 3rd to prepare to go East in the Spring to get the DeseretAlphabet type made and some books printed in itI met with the Regency on the 11th. Thesubject was brought up concerning Adam being made of thedust of the earth. Orson Pratt pursued a course of stubbornessand unbelief in what President Young saidBaptism of my Family over 8 YearsMarch the 16thOn this day I baptized all my family who were overeight years of age and on the 18th Mrs Phebe Woodruff andmyself took our two oldest children Wilford and Phebe to thehouse of the Lord to receive their endowments. I washedand anointed my son Wilford and ordained him to the officeof an Elder and sealed upon him all the blessings of hisordination anointing and my birthright in compliance withthe counsel of President Kimball.Thus was fulfilled the blessing ofFather Joseph Smith the first Patriarch who sealed uponmy head before I had any children that I should haveposterity who should receive the Priesthood and my oldestson received it this day under my hands 
 their horses to get out of the way.When I arose on the morning of the 9th I found theearth covered with snow and that the city had been alive with oursoldiers since midnight preparing to go into the mountains to meet withthe enemy.Col. Johnson said to Maj. Allen, of our Expedition, whom theyhad taken prisoner "God damn you when I get to Bridger I will hang you."So Maj. Allen thinking there was not much chancefor his life and prefering shooting to hanging during the same evening,though closly guarded by 24 men, pulled off his boots and walked up toa fire to warm his toes and while steping around to warm his feet hemade a spring and cleared himself of the guard.Escape of Major Allen From the U.S. ArmyHe ran into the midst of a herd of cattle so they could not shoothim. Horsemen immediately started in persuit but in the darknessof the night they could not overtake him. He ran in his stockingfeet in the snow for 30 miles carrying his boots in his hand not daringto stop to put them on and arrived in our camp in safety.Our men took 100 head of cattle one night and300 head another which were now coming into the cityOn the 11th Dr Hickman arrived in the city. He hadbeen a prisoner in the enemy's camp for a long time but they let himgo. 'Twas his opinion that Col Johnson would try to come in. Theytalked of breaking up into small companies and trying to come in invarious waysThere had been on the arrival of the first intelligence ofCol Johnson's movements been 1300 men ordered into the mountains besidesthose already there.

President Young made some remarks concerning sending missionaries abroad and said he would send many to the States if he could get those of the right stripe.

 live and 4 of the Col. staff and they had 23 baggage waggons.They stoped a short time in front of the Governor'sOffice and then continued their march towards the mountains of snow asnearly 2000 of their brethren had done before. Many went withwet feet poor boots and straw hats on and without tents or fire for thatnight as they could not reach timber until the next day. This showedthe willingness of the Saints to maintain the Kingdom of God anddefend themselves against our enemiesOn the 26th Ben Simons a Cherokee calledinto President Young's office. He had been two days in the campof the enemy. He said they wanted salt very much. Their cattlewere dying very fast and they were cutting timber and digging holesin the earth which looked like going into Winter Quarters. The merchantswere suffering for want of food and they deserved it for they had beenthe means in a great measure in bringing on the war.Next day President Young sentA Load of Salt as a Present to the U.S. Armywith a letter to Col Johnson. The President read us theletter which was rich and interestingArrival of Governor Cummings and Others in the U.S. Camp.An express came in on the 287th in the night saying that GovernorCummings & Lieut.

Ten were bound for the United States 13 to the Sandwich Ilands 2 to California 23 to England and Europe 22 to Canada 2 to the Cape of Good Hope. (The two to California were to take charge of the office of the Western Standard.) One missionary was sent to ^South^ Africa 1 to Denmark 1 to Switzerland 2 to Italy and 19 to the Express CompanyThe Hand Cart Missionaries StartApril 23rd 1857The missionaries met at Temple Block and a vast number of the people assembled and they ^were^ addressed by Orson Hyde Lorenzo ^Snow^ Wilford Woodruff J. Clinton and Joseph Young. President Young came into the crowd and told the people to go home about their business and for the missionaries to start upon their journey. So all the Elders had their handcarts fitted up and started out. There was 25 hand-carts and from two to three men to each cart and many two horse teams loaded with flour to supply the Stations for the carrying company The Presidency and Twelve with hundreds of people went up to the Bench and the^re^ organized and returned.On the 25 of May my daughter Phebe had a very severe attack of inflamation on the lungs or something like the plurisy and could not breathe only with great difficulty. We bolstered her up in bed and she would catch for breath like a person strauglingWe annointed ^her^ laid hands upon her and rebuked the desease. I finally got Joseph Smith's hankerchief which he gave me in 1839 and said it should remain as a league betwen us as long as I would keep it. I laid the handkerchief and she became somewhat better and sleptArrival Of George A. Smith and Others 
 evening and the following named persons received their blessings andwhere [were] set apart for their missions: Elders Orson Pratt George A SmithEzra T. Benson Erastus Snow Truman O. Angel and Phineas YoungWilford Woodruff wrote them all from memory three days afterwardsand had them copied into the Historian's Book of Events. GeorgeA. Smith's blessing was written at his dictation by T. Bullock; butthe remainder Wilford Woodruff wrote.On the 15th I met with President Young at his officewith George A. Smith and Thomas Bullock and read Church Historyto him. I was getting initiated into my office as Assistant ChurchHistorian to take charge of the Historian's office and business inthe absence of George A. SmithIn reading the revelation upon Patriarchal marriageand while upon the paragraph relating to the sheding of innocent bloodPresident Young remarked that it was a very nice point to distinguishbetween i^n^nocent blood and that which is not innocent. Were we nowcommanded to go and avenge the blood of the Prophets where it wouldreach infants from the cradle to the third and fourth generationshould we know what to do in such case? We should not. Butthere is one thing that is a consolation to me and that is that I amsatisfied that the Lord will not require it of this people until theybecome sanctified and are led by the Spirit of God so as not toshed innocent bloodAgain what does the saying mean that allshall be damned who do not keep this law unto whom it isrevealled? Does it mean that they shall take more wives thanone? I think that it includes the whole law with itscovenants. I think that many who come into this world willbe damned or disorganized and I think that this is the ^second^ deathwhich is referred to that ^as^ the broad road leads to ^death^ while few willenter through the straight gate into the fulness of eternal lifePresident Young had brother Cannon take[sideways text] ^revise diction^ [end of sideways text] 
 Office as an express had arrived from the enemy bringingA Proclamation From A. Cumming^s^ as Governor of Utah.We found Brother Brigham Young and Carrington at the Office; and soonHeber C. Kimball, A. O. Smoot Lorenzo Young and others came. BrotherCarrington read the Proclamation in which A Cummings called himselfGovernor of Utah and said that the President of the United States appointedhim Governor of Utah. He commanded all thearmed people to disperseto their homes and said all that opposed them would be treated as traitorsHe also wrote a letter to Governor Young accusing him of treason andsaid that he should establish his quarters in Green River County andorganize a temporary government and that all would be tried for treasonwho opposed them.We went to the Tabernacle and after the Preaching BrotherCarrington read the Proclamation and the lettersDisbanding and Return of our Troops from the MountainsOn the 2nd of December early in the morningthe troops began to arrive having been dismissed by General Wellsand they continued to pour into the city until a late hour of the day.Brother Southworth who had been a prisoner related to me his capture&c. He said among the rest that when he came up with HowardLivingston the principal merchant of G. S. L. City he asked him to intercedewith Johnston to let him go asto his family as they had nothing againsthim only that he was a Mormon but Livingston would do nothingfor him.He reported that there was much of the spirit of desertionin the camp and that the officers treated their soldiers in a cruel mannerand that many would desert if they could. He said that thegreatest amount of any one article in the camp was ardent spiritsHe thought there were 100 waggon loads of it. Howard Livingston 
 On the 29th the Eastern Mail arrived bringing George A Smith J. M. Bernhisel ^and Truman O Angel^On Sunday in the Prayer Circle letters were ^read^ touching Utah affairs in the States. We found that all hell was boiling over against us. Among the rest Wm Smith called upon the Government to furnish him with an army and money and he would come to Utah and subdue the MormonsIn conversation in the Historian's Office on the 2nd of Junebetween President Young George A Smith Joseph Young and myself the PresidentsaidThere is no law in heaven or earth that would compel a woman to stay with a man either in time or eternity. This I think is true but I do not know. If a man who is a High Priest takes a woman and she leaves him and goes to one of a lower office say the lesser Priesthood or members, I think in the resurrection that that High Priest can claim herJoseph Young: What if she should not want to go with him? I should not want a woman under those circumstancesBrigham: I will tell you what you will find that all theseevil traditions and affections or passions that haunt the mind in this life will all be done away in the resurrection. You will find then that any man who gets a glory and exaltation will be so beautiful that any woman would be willing to have him if it was right and whenever it is right for the woman to go there she will be willing to go for all those evils will vanish to which we are subject in this life. I have told the truth just as it is but others will at times will get up and tell the people that they will have no heaven only what they make in this life and that it will be in the next world as it will be this. Now they do not mean what they say. They do not explain themselves and hence the people do not understandJoseph Young said, "I wish I knew what my limits are" and the President replied"Your limits are endless and you have not go half way to the end of it yet. Now when I was an Elder I was as 
 a daguarreaotype of the temple draft for Truman O Angel to takewith him to England. President Young wrote the words to beput upon one of the stones of the Temple:"Holliness to the Lord. The Temple of our Godbuilt by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints commencedon the 6th day of April A.D. 1853On the next day I met again with President Youngand George A Smith and Thomas Bullock read manuscript of theChurch History up to Joseph and Hyrum's martyrdom in jail. Itbrought fresh to mind the scenes of those sorrowful days.This was the last day George A Smithspent with President Young reading History before starting toWashington as a Delegate from the Deseret State ConventionWe dined with President Young. I paid 75 dollars in cashas a donation to the poor fund into the hands of brother McIntoshOn the 18th in the Historian's Office George A Smith and myself laid our hands upon the head of SamuelHarrison Baliley Smith the son of Samuel Smith one of the"Witnesses to the Book of Mormon" and ordained him one of theSeventies and set him apart to go on mission to ^England^George A Smith was mouth.About this time Parley Pratt was verysick. On the 17th Oson his brother myself and George ASmith laid hands upon him. He had been insensible for twodays. On Sunday the 20th J. M. Grant Bishop HoaglandJoseph Horn and myself laid hands upon him again and as hisfamily was out of bread we 4 gave each 50 lbs of flour making200 lbs.I met with the Presidency and Twelve on thisSunday in Prayer Circle. After prayers President Youngasked those who were going away on missions if theywere satisfied with him and felt satisfied that he was 
 had an outfit of liquor which amounted to $10,00[0] first cost; and allthe army had a great amount of liquor as well as all the SuttlersThe officers were drunk every dayHe also said that there was a division of theofficers as well as the soldiers. A portion of them think thatGovernor Young is justified in taking the course he does in his owndefence. Their animals were dying so fast that they allexpected to be on foot before next Spring. They had sent Captain Marcy to Texas to buy mules horses and oxen.Summary of the Season's ExpeditionThe Expedition of the Season was now entirelyclosed. We had clearly seen the hand of God made visible inour behalf. An army had been sent by the United States tomake war for the sole purpose to destroy the Church of Jesus Christof Latter-day Saints. The Kingdom of God had been drivenfrom the confines of the United States into the Rocky Mountainsthen Mexican territory with the hope of the nation that we shouldperish but as soon as they found that we should live and prosperthey became alarmed and resolved upon our destruction and nowthe United States had sent their armies out to accomplish theirhellish purpose.As soon as this was known unto us theour leaderof the Church and Kingdom of God rose up in the strength of Israel'sGod and proclaimed Israel free. His counsellors Heber C Kimballand Daniel H Well with the Twelve Apostles sustained him and allthe people said, Amen.He testified unto the people in the name ofGod that if they would be united with him in their faith prayers andworks the enemy should not have power to come into ourValley; that the Lord would hedge up their way and we should 
 willing to correct an Eerror in the brethren and I am now; but the people do not see it so. Now if you should be with the Twelve or anybody you would have a right to correct an error as well as with a member but you could not correct them by cutting them off from the Church because they are over you in the PriesthoodProphecies of Joseph and Brigham upon William SmithOn Sunday the 14 of June in the Prayer circle the subject of William Smith was brought up. It was said that Joseph Smith prophesied that his brother William would become a good man whenhe became an old man. Some of the brethren present at our prayer circle thought he said if he ever did become good it would be when he wasan old man.President Young then said whether Joseph said it or not I will say in the name of the Lord that if William Smith lives till he is 65 or 70 he will become a good humble man; he will do the best he can He will have to answer for his sins. Write this brother Woodruffand put it into the Church History. When a man gives way to the power of the devil he finds it hard to recover himself.The Female Relief SocietyOn the 17th they met at my house. There were about 50 presentsewing knitting sewing carpet rags making quilts &c. It is a laudableundertaking. All the females in the Ward met at my house each Wednesday afternoon. They open and close with prayer Mrs Phebe Wo Woodruff was President and Mrs Pratt secretary. They clothedall the poor in the Ward and during the last quarter the^y^ made a donation to the Perpetual Emigration Fund of 126 dollars.We finished reading Samuel Smith's ^history^ on the 16th and found in the office the histories of David Patten Samuel 
 keeping up with the Spirit of the times? They all said they wereand asked him if he was satisfied with them. He said he was. ThePresident advised Elder George A Smith not to indulge in arguingany point question or principle which he did not believe for the sakeof argument or to draw something out of others as it was a dangerousground. George A. thanked him for his advise and promisedto follow it. Brother Smith also spoke in plainness his feelingsconcerning some of the principles of Elder Orson Pratt wherein hediffered from ^the^ President concerning the creation of Adam out of the dust of the earth and the final consummation of knowledgeand many other things. Orson Pratt promised he would not publish anything in oppositionto President Young's viewsOn the Monday the Historian's Office was crowdedwith clerks taking a copy of the census: 291 was the highest numberat any one timeThe missionaries left the city on the morning ofthe 22nd and met at the mouth of the Kanyon. I took my familyin a carriage and drove there to visit them and take minutes of theirorganization. President Young arrived at half past 10 o'clockand organized the company by appointing A. O. Smoot captainWilliam Miller captain of the guard Elder Benson Chaplainand James Ure clerk. He gave them some instructionconcerning their journey and also gave them his parting blessingBrother J. V. Long reported his speech and Wilford Woodruff tooka list of the names of those going East on mission and found themto be 36 in number. Professor Orson Pratt was going to Liverpool to take the place of Franklin D. Richards. He was accompaniedby Elder E. T. Benson also of the Twelve Apostles and other missionariesto England. The Hon. George A Smith was going to Washingtonas a delegate from our State Convention to urge in connection with the Hon. John Taylor the claims of Utah to be numberedwith the States. Elder Erastus Snow of the Twelve was goingto St Louis to preside and publish the Luminary and Marshal 
 not be called to shed their blood neither should they have power to shed ours. ThisPresident Young had taught from day to day when there was every prospectthat the enemy would try to come.From 2 to 3 thousand of the brethren had armedthemselves and went into the Mountains according to the counsel of PresidentYoung and they were led by their valient General Daniel H. Wells to hedgeup the way of the enemy should they attempt to come in. Our brethrenhad made large entrenchments and ditches and piled up large massesof rocks in narrow passes so as to roll them down upon the enemyand destroy them should they attempt to come in. But as theProphets Brigham and Heber had said so it came to pass. The Lordfought our battles and hedged up the way of our enemies. Whenthey got to Ham's Fork 150 miles from our city the storms and coldkilled their horses mules and cattle by hundreds so that whenthe whole army got together with the Governor and Judges whom theGovernment had sent to rule and tyranize over us they hadnot enough teams left to daraw one third of their trains so theywere oblidgged to stop and spend the Winter in the storms of theMountains and their wisdom seems taken from themOur brethren had been enabled to head themlike a herd of cattle and they had shot grape and musket andminnie [minié] balls at them from time to time and those balls hadflown like hail around the servants of God but not a drop oftheir blood had been shed neither had the brethren returned the fireupon the enemy even as much as in one instance. Fear hadso taken hold upon them that they would flee into their mainbody at the approach of a small number of our brethren and theLord had frustrated the enemy in all their designs against us upto this day.Through all this President Young had been as calmnas a Summer's day and the army of Zion was now returning totheir homes with the same spirit of composure and quietude as 
 Heywood and others wher on an official trip to WashingtonI returned to the city and found the clerksbusy making out the papers for the Hon. George A Smith. I stoped till midnight in the Office and most of the clerks remainedall night making out the census papers which was forwarded thenext morning to George A Smith express by John Sharp.Another Attempt of the Destroyer on My Life.I have been marked as a victem for the attacks of the Destroyerfrom my infancy up to the present time. I have faced accidentsmisfortunes and apparently death so many times that it had becomea proverb with me to say that there has seemed to be two powersconstantly watching me and at work with me one to kill andthe other to save me. Thus far the power to save meand preserve my life had prevailed. How long I should be blessedwith this preserving power and care time must determineI had never until now been calledupon to war with poison and mortification in my system. Butsuch was now the case. I extract the following verbatumfrom my daily Journal written at the time"26th: I am unwell this morning. I ambreaking out all over my body. My family think it isthe measels but I had the measels when I was a boy. Duringthe evening I broke out all over something resembling the "hives"I just begin to understand what it is that is making me sickI had an ox die on the 21st. It was supposed that he died withpoison. He was mortified. While assisting in skinning himI scratched my hwrist sufficient to innoculate myself with thepoison which is now beginning to work.Sunday the 27th I was quite unwelland did not attend meeting. The cut upon my wrist began 
 Smith and Hyrum Smith the Patriarch all written by their own hands and we did not know that they were in the Office. We were glad to get these JournalsThe Constitution of the KingdomI^n^ a great discourse delivered by President Young on Sunday the 21st he said among many other important items, "The Constitution of the UnitedStates was got up by inspiration. It gives all men the rights of conscience So it will be in the Millennium. It will be like the Constitution. All will have to bow the knee and acknowledge the Lord that it is his rightto reign but they must not blaspheme; but they may enjoy their own religionMen talk about making a law to stop Polygamy in Utah that would be an expose facto law and the Constitution declairs that Congress shall make no such law and if the time comes when the United States do make a law and send men to punish me for Polygamy or having more than one wife as there is no law against it you may make up your mind that I shall send them to hell. I do not think they will do it but if they do you may tell them they had better send 100,000 men with provisions for five years and they may make their calculations upon it they will want to make forts from one end of the route to the other so that they can step from one to the other. There is a sweeping clause against this proceding. When they charter a ship company to build ships and control them they cede up their right in the case. So it is in the Territories. They have a Territorial Government. This people should have the right to govern their own institutionsNews of the Murder of Parley P. Pratt.On the 23rd the Eastern Mail arrived being 23 days from Indipendence. Ferreyemore Little and Ephraim Hanks came with it. It was the shortest trip ever made up to this dateThe mail brought the sad news of the murder 
 to gather poison and turn black28th I became satisfied on Monday that I had this enemy poisonand mortification to meet and that to in the worse form. There is buta small chance for a man to live who is innoculated with poison andmortification by dissecting the body of either man or beast. It is muchworse than drinking poison or being bit by poisonous serpants forit is in a much more deadly form. Several have died this Springby skining cattle which have died. All should be more cautiousthan what I have been in this matter, and not run the risk of loosingtheir lives to save the skins of animals who die of disease. Thefollowing account will show the opperation of this disease withme from day to day and how near I came loosing my life: infact I was only saved through the power and mercy of GodThis morning the affected spot upon mywrist had grown to about the size of a dime and had risen abovethe arm and main ^flesh^ about half an inch and turned black as ink. My arm began to swell and pain me andI felt the poison and mortification working through my systemI called upon President Young and showed him my arm and askedhis advice and he counselled me to go to immediately and clensemy stomach and bowels and poultice my arm with onionsearth or anything that would draw it from my systemHe also advised me to show it to Dr Sprague. I did soand he in addition to what President Young had recommendeddug me up some dock ^elecampane^ blazing star roots, and advisedme to make a tea of it also to make a poultice of it andput in on my arm. I went immediately home and put thesethings into execution for I saw that I had a strong warefare inorder to save my life29th: This was a trying day in my life. Thepoison had so circulated through my system that it was afflictingmy whole body seriously. I became so weak that I could not stand 
 they carried with them into the Mountains on this momentusous expeditionAs they passed by President Young's they gave him a quiet saluteand passed on in silence to their homes while he gazed upon themwith thanksgiving and praise to the God of IsraelOn the 3rd of December the California mailarrived and we found from the papers that the massacre of theemigrants by the Indians was laid to the charge of the Mormonsand the people of Loss Angelos had held public meetings and calledupon the passed resolutions to call upon the President of the UnitedStates to exert his power to bring the murderers to justice. Allthe Saints in Calaifornia were returning home and Elder GeorgeQ Cannon had got out half a sheet of the "Standard" and therewas quite an excitement concerning the Mormon question.Near Escape of One of our Scouting Parties.General Wells related that brother Maxwell hadcommand of a small scouting company. They took a horse fromthe enemy and was fired at by them but no one was hurt. Theywent back to their encampment. Brother Maxwell becamestrongly impressed that there was danger in their way and thatthey ought to leave their camp. He told his brethren this butsome of them did not think so and all went to bed. But thesefeelings increased upon brother Maxwell and he arose from hisbed and told his brethren he was going to leave that place immediatelyand they all gathered up their horses and went several miles backand camped for the night and soon the encampment which theyhad just left was surrounded by a hundred men and had it nothave been for this warning they probably would have been all takenprisonersThe Legislature.

 of Parley P. Pratt the second member of the Quorum of the Twelve. He was killed by [blank space] McLain who shot himsee [Sta][blank space]The death of brother Parley was painful news to his family. I went with Orson Hyde George A Smith and Amasa Lyman to visit the family of our murdered brother and to comfort them on the death of their husband and father.[blank space]By this mail sisters Sayers and Vose arrivedSister Vose was 77 years of age and rode 12000 in 23 days. She had been a member of the Church ^almost^ from the begining. She had given thousands of dollars for the Elders and for the building up of the kingdomIn the Office on the 23rd President Young asked George A. Smith if it was not hard to acknowledge the hand of God in the death of Parley P. Pratt by as wicked a man as McLain yet we shall shave to do itThomas B Marsh Pleads for MercyThomas B Marsh once the President of the quorum of the Twelve ^per letter^ plead for mercy and asked President Young if it was not too 
 upon my feet. It took two persons to lead me from the fireto my bed. I could not talk no more than if I had beendrunk; my stomach and bowels ceased to act and judgingfrom outward appearence it seemed as though I should not livetwenty four hours. My wife and friends labouredwith me throughout the day faithfully and with emetics andinjections and with raw onion poultices upon my arm Igot my whole system in opperation before night. PresidentYoung in company with Dr Sprague called upon me at aboutevening. I was better than I had been through the dayBrothers Young and Sprague laid hands upon me and blessedme. The following is a synopsis of the blessing which thePresident pronounced upon my head which I wrote frommemory after my recovery:"Brother Wilford; in the name ofJesus Christ and by virtue of the Holy Priesthood I lay myhands upon your head to bless you; and I ask my Fatherin Heaven to stay the disease which is resting upon youand to cleanse your blood and to heal you: and Isay in the name of Jesus Christ that you shall not diebut shall live to finish your work which is appointed youto do upon the earth. The adversary has sought manytimes to destroy your life from the earth but the Lordhas preserved you and will preserve you until your workis done. I feel to say that all is right here. I feelto ask the Lord to bless all the means you make use offor your recovery. You shall be healed up from thisdisease and live to enjoy the society of your family andyour children shall grow up around you and you shallbe a blessing to them. Let your heart be comforted;all shall be well with you: and I seal these blessingsupon you in the name of Jesus Christ: Amen. 
 On the 14th of December the Legilslature of the Territoryof Utah met at the Social Hall at 10 o'clock. Both Houses met and organizedin about 30 minutes and adjourned till the morrowPresenting The Message of Governor YoungDec. 15th 1857Both Houses were in Joint Session and Governor Young appeared at12 minutes to eleven o'clock and made a few remarks and then presentedhis Message to the Assembly which was read by the chief clerk of theHouse James Ferguson. It was the most august document I ever heardBen Simmons arrived in the city the next dayand called upon President Young with D. Huntington. He saidthere wasDivison of Parties in the ArmyOne party was the military and the other was called fFrememen. Therewas a fight among them and 7 men killed.  Johnson sentthe military to quell the mob and Governor Cumming toldthem to go back that when he wanted them he would call forthem.The Superintendant of Indian affairs said he had a millionof gold to give the Indians of this Territory.One man gathered up one bag of salt that our men hadthrown away which was sent by Governor Young but rejected by ColJohnson. The man sold it to the merchants for $20 and they soldit to the soldiers for 2 or 13 dollars per lb. Ben Simmons took out900 lbs of salt and sold it for $2.50 ^100^ cts per lb making $2250 and $1per lb for service berries.Livingston said he would give $500 for the privilegeof coming into the city if he did not stop but one day. McGrawwas the worse man in the army and he had the most to say against 
 for him to fill his mission. President Young said yes it was but I am willing to forgive him and that he may be baptized and confirmed. Then let him comehere.Brother Brigham said if we live our religion we shall have all the world upon us. I will tell you the time has come when the Elders have got to take care of themse[lves] for the people will publish a lie and they will shoot them if they are not carefulThe people must know that there is a God in heaven and circoumstances will bring this thing to bear. I am fe^e^ble but I hope I shall yet live to preach in Jackson County ^St Louis^ Cincinnati New York and through the Eastern StatesI had a dream. I thought I saw my family picking all kinds of flowers and fruit. I thought I went East to preach and I saw that the people in the Valley had dug down the mountain or cut it down square and brought the soil out of the mountain and made some good gardens. I went on East and I heard a Methodist Priest pray for sinners. A man followed me and asked me if I wanted some brass. I told him no. They wanted me to steal somethingI told them I would not do it. It was moles ^moulds^ to make coin in that they wanted me to steal. I saw ^stolen^ goods in great piles and stacks that the people in the Eastern States had stolen; and some tried to raise a mob upon me but I did not fear them. Soon I saw some brethren. I saw one apostate. He wanted to kill me. I told him if he did not behave himself I would send him to hell. I again saw the brethren cut down the mountain and make good farms I thought these were good times."The above is President Young's dream. The President said if President Young the Lord our God does not visit the United States then I am no Prophet and we shall find that all good men will come to the mountains for safetyPresident Young Heber C Kimball George A Smith Amasa Lyman and Charles C. Rich on the 25 came into 
 30th. I spent a sick day. I poulticed my arm. Itcontinued to swell to a great degree and as the poison was drawn intoit from my system it inflamed and mortified and looked as though mywhole body would soon be mortified. I continued to poultice myarm with raw onions earth and powdered roots which drew the impuritiesof my body into it. The poison that was ^ran^ out of my arm wouldblister my flesh like a hot iron wherever it touched and the fleshwould turn black and dead. As the onion and earth poulticeswere not strong enough to draw the poison and mortification outsufficiently I pounded up some charcoal fine and made it wetwith the juice of wormwood ragwood^weed^ and wild sage and put it onmy arm as a poultice and it began to take the mortificationpoison and swelling out of it. I was very sick and having ahard warefare between life and death but President Young promisedme that I should live and I act in faith upon that promise inall that I do. I feel that I shall live and not dieMay 1st. This was also an exceeding sick dayI took a course of medicine to clense my system and continuedthe charcoal poultices on my arm which had a good effect2nd. I felt some better to day yet very sickbut I was enabled to sit up a little. I was quite excited inthe evening. Wilford and Moroni was ploughing in thebig field four miles from home and at about 4 o'clock in theafternoon one of the horses came home upon a run with a part ofthe harness on. We did not know but the boys were killeduntil we sent a man down into the field with the horse. Hefound the boys not hurt. The horses had run away withthe plough. In jumping over the bars they left the ploughsticking into the post with the doubletrees. They broke thewhippletrees and harness to peaces but I felt thankful the boysescaped unhurt. One was my own son and the other myIndian boy. 
 usThere ^were^ 500 men who had left for the States several of whom had been frozento death. John Biglar a great gambler took out of the army in a dayby gambling $25,000 and carried it off in a buck shot sackBen Simons wanted to continue the trade withthe army and wished another Cherokee to have a pass to go with him.President Young asked him if he had not made money enough. He saidhe wanted to make all he could. President Young told him thathe must not take the enemy anything to eat. He might salt [sell] themsalt and fire but nothing to eat.They said there were potatoes and turnips at FortSupply a plenty but Governor GCummings would not let them have themPresident Young said he felt some of the time likegiving them hell. If they had the power they would make this citya perfect Bedlam and they would corrupt the people as fastas they couldTo Elder Wilford Woodruff,By Eliza R. Snow.With true respect, and as a tribute due,To friendship, brother Woodruf unto you,As one more blessed than most your fellow men,I now address the effusion of my pen.You were appointed, ere your mortal birth,To an Apostleship upon the earth;The Lord our God has had his eye on thee,With watchful care from earliest infancy. 
 the Historian's Office and sat and conversed upon a variety of subjects. The President said that David Patten and T B. Marsh came to Kirtlandin the fall of 1837. As soon as they came I got Marsh to go to Joseph but Patten would go to Warren Parrish. He got his mind prejudiced and when he went to see Joseph David insulted Joseph; and Joseph slap^ped^ him in the face and kicked him out of the yard. This did David good.I could not sleep in those days. I spent many a night, all night without sleeping at all. I prayed a good deal and my mind was constantly active.Brother Charles C Rich gave an account of the the death of David W. Patten. He said as we charged upon the mob two men remained behind the bank. Patten took after one of them and I the other and the man that Patten took after turned round and shot him and he fell to the ground only but a few steps from meIn the prayer circle on Sunday the 28th President Young spoke of Strang and his death and so did J. M.Bernhisal who thought that George Miller was also dead. George A Smith said that he was informed that Miller had gathered the followers of Strang about 60 in munber [number]. President Young said they made a business of stealing but let men come here and they would see that we had shown the works of industryPhelps said the man in Clay County Court House who said he would kill Jo. Smith and if the Turkey buzzards did not eat out his eyes they should eat out his own (Phelps stood within a few feet of him) while going home the boat sunk and he was drowned and he floated upon some floodwood and the buzzardseat out his eyes and flesh. Phelps saw his body after this and a man said he had fulfilled his own prophesyOrson Hyde told of a man who was one of the first settlers of Ma^issouri^ who helped to drive out the Saints and it had since troubled him so much that he had sold out and 
 I continued very sick during the next four days ^week^The charcoal poultices were constantly applied with much effect andanother course of medicine taken and I suffered much from theLobelia in my stomach. A good deal of dead flesh hadgathered in my arm. Dr. Sprague cut out a portion of it witha penknife but did not get it all out.The Eastern Mail came in on the 9thand brought most of the mail since last November. Manythousands of letters were received in the cityCorrespondance From the Chief Gardener of Queen VictoriaAmong the rest was a letter from the Chief Gardener of herMajesty Queen Victoria who wished to open correspondencewith the Horticultural Society of this Valley and make anexchange of seeds &c.On Sunday the 11th in the evening Iattended Prayer circle and sat 2 hours and heard lettersread from correspondents in New York Washington LiverpoolLondon and various parts of the earthI found that I could not get rid of thedead flesh in my ^arm^ without using something to eat it out; so on the 12th I took 20 grains of lunar costic or nitred ofsilver and disolved it in two tablespoons of water and washedthe edges where the dead and living flesh met and it beganslowly to seperateI was feeling a little better the next daybut still very weak and feeble. The dead flesh was parting in myarm.Next day I was able to walk to the Historian'sOffice; and at 1 o'clock in the morning I was called upon toadminister to Sister Orson Pratt. I promised her that 
 You was preserved, midst Bablyonish night,From Atheistic and sectarian blight;From manly rectitude you did not swerve;The Priests of Baal you never stooped to serve.From heavenly courts, the light that's shining now,Shone on your path, and mantled o'er your brow;Eternal visions opened to your view;You loved the truth and found salvation too.You then with joy the Gospel banner bore,To distant lands and on your native shore;In truths defence most valiently you stood,And cleared your garments of the Gentiles' blood.One of the chosen Twelve, who're called to stand,To turn the Gospel key for ev'ry land;Your name in honour, as a faithful one,To future generations will be known.With heart inspired, rich matter to indite,In Zion now your business is to wrigte;With skill, you wield the ready writer's pen,'Tis yours to immortalize the deeds of men.Full many a righteous act and gifted word,By Saints performed, from lips of Prophets heard,Had slip'd the mem'ries of judious men,But for the promptings of your faithful pen. 
 left the placePresident Young asked Wm W. Phelps if astrology was true and Phelpssaid "I don't know." President Young observed Brother Woodruff write that down This is the first thing I ever heard of but what brother Phelps knew. He says he dont know anything about astrology. But I believe it is true. So is mesmerism or there is true principle in itOn Sunday the 29th in his remarks Wilford Woodruffsaid he had faith in the doctrine taught by President Young for the rising generation to go in foot instead of on horse back. He said "I know the good of it by experience. I travelled 1200 miles in one of my journies on foot and averaged 40 miles a day; then waded the Missipp^ssippi^ swamp from Little Rock, Ark. to Mamphis Tennesee 200 miles and only 16 miles out of water. One day I walked 60 miles and while on journey walked 72 miles without eating and when I got to Eagle C^reek^ with Parrish I beleive I could have beaten ^killed^ any horse I ever saw, walking to have followed it"There is another thing I wish to speak of. We know how things have been in Nauvoo. Joseph and Hyrum the leaders of the people were killed. If the time ever comes again when the leaders of this people are called for I am opposed to their being given up. I do not care what the consequences are for if any have got to die let if be some of the rest of us who are not of as much consequence as they are but I want them to live to lead Israel as long as there is anybody to lead. Let us obey counsel in all things and if necessary go into the mountains and we will increaseuntil the wicked will say let us not go against Zion to battle for her sons are terrible and we cannot stand."Indipendance DayThe inhabitants of the city celebrated the day by a splendid military performance. The legion met on the public square

Wilford took the horsesto carry posts and poles to my pasture with the running gearsWhile coming home my new horse started suddenly into a runWilford could not hold them. They ran three blocks with himand in turning the corner they turned the hind wheels three timesover with Wilford setting upon the exeltree. The horses continuedto run with the forewheels until they ran against the fence. My son was stunned and picked up for dead but he soon came toand finally led one of the horses home and a man rode homethe other. Wilford was hurt in one leg and badly jarred inthe head but he had a comfortable night's rest and I feltthankful that he was not killedSunday the 18th was the first time I attendedmeeting in the Tabernacle since the attack upon my life by poison andmortificationOn the 30th I read to President Young the letter thatthe Horticultural Society had received from Sir William JacksonHooper Director of the Royal Gardens Kensington London.

 The Church Historian's labours to devide,As his Assistant, coupled side by side,You write for Zion, where her histry's known;Inscribing her's, perpetuates your own.Faithful to God, and to your brethren true,Integrity has twined a wreath for you,Of never fading laurels, which will be,A glorious coronet eternally,In that blessed world, where light and knowledge dwell,Your blessedness no earthly tongue can tell,Where heaven's effulgence will your head surround,And you with everlasting glory crowned.Filled with immortal majesty and might,Associated with the Gods in light,With gifts and powers of endless lives, you'll beProgressing on and on eternally.G. S. L. City, November 23rd 1857On the 18th of December George A. Smith and myselfcalled upon President Brigham Young to ask him concerning Joseph'steachings upon the endowments; and how much we were to make a subjectof public history. President Young told us Joseph's instructions to himconcerning the 2nd Anointing and other Temple matters. See myprivate manuscript Journals date Dec 18th 1857On Monday the 21st of Dec I met with theLegislative Council: most of the time we were in Joint Sessions. 
 more than ever I saw out together before in this city. We were dismissed before the Governor's residence at 12 o'clockA Great Picknick Party 24th of JulyI took my family in my waggon and started for the mouth of the Big Cottonwood Kanyon on the 22nd of July to attend the great Picknick party of President Young and company at the head waters of the Big Cottonwood to celebrate the 24^th^ of July in commemoration of the enetry of the Pioneers into the Valley of the Great Salt Lake. On the first night we camped in the Big Cottonwood where the brethren were cutting Granite for the Temple. Brother Rich and George A Smith Amasa Lyman and many others camped with me. The whole road was lined with waggons for milesand they camped wherever they could drive out of the road.We arose next morning before 3 o'clock and started on our road. The Twelve followed the Presidency and the guards. The string of waggons reached for many miles. We arrived at the Campground at about 132 o'clockand the last waggon did not arrive till near midnight. The whole company munbered [numbered] 2587 persons with 468 carriages and waggons; 1028 horses and mules 332 oxen and cows. Flags were raised upon the highest peacks that surrounded us and the stars and stripes were placed upon the highest trees. The surrounding scenes of mountains valleys lakes woods and medows made the sight the most interesting I ever beheld. We had prayers at night and an address from President Young. There were five bands of music in attendance.On the 24th in keeping up the aniversary of the enterance of the Pioneers into the valleys we had music singing prayers addresses and each one enjoyed himself the best he could. Many trout were caught in the Lake. The 
 in the Bowery. Leonard I Smith returned missionaryfrom South Africa preached in the morning and was followedby brother KimballIn the afternoon President Young wished all theable bodied men to go immediately to work and finish the canalto bring Big Cottonwood Creek to water the five acre lotsHe requested all the Bishops to stand up and all the menof the Wards who could go and dig on it. 333 names wereobtained. The 14th Ward gave the most names. Theyobtained at their evening's meeting 45 names.President Young's Dream of the War.At our prayer circle in the evening the subject of theKansas question was spoken of. Wilford Woodruffasked President Young if he remembered the dream thathe had several years ago and President Young saidhe did not recolect it. The following is the substance of his dream.He dreamt that he saw two armies meetone came from the South and the other from the East ^North^ andthey met and fought and as fast as they were killed they continued to have new recruits from the East and South.I testify that I heard President Young relate this dreamseveral ^some^ years before this ^at Nauvoo^ but cannot state the dateOn Sunday the 22nd of June PresidentYoung preached a great discourse. Among other things hesaid that the Devils were cast out of heaven to the earth andthey are still around us. Their condemnation is that they can never have a tabernacle but they seek to getinto the tabernacles of men. All, both good and bad,when they die remain here upon the earth the same 
 Resolutions were offered upon the merits of the Governor's Message which resolutionswere like declarations of Indipendence against wicked and ungodly men. Thisdrew speeches from John Taylor George A Smith Wilford Woodruff Orson Hydeand others.Legislative Room BurnedDec 26 1857Early in the morning a report came that the Social Hall was on fireI soon went over and found the room which the Legislative Council occupiednearly burned up and part of the chairs.On the 31st I called upon President Young andasked his opinion concerning a cotton company. He said the time hadcome for us to act and not talk. If the people had done the same asyou and I have concerning sheep there would now have been a good supplyin this Territory. And with regard to cotton I am now going to sendmen into the cotton country to make cotton for me so that I can have someto use myself and if you or any of the brethren wish to join me you canI looked over my Journal for the year 1857 andmade up my usual Synopsis and of the events of the year I recorded myreflections of the day as follows"It has been an important year to Zion and the world1857 will be the year on history's page from which will be dated thecommencement of the downfall of the United States. For it is during thisyear that they have enttered the field as open enemies and persecuters ofthe Saints of the Most High God and and have sent an army of 2500 menover 1000 miles for the purpose of laying a foundation for the destructionof the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints who have settled here inin the Great Bason of North America, called Utah Territory or the Stateof Deseret. Here in the Valleys of the Mountains is establishedthe kingdom of God which Daniel saw by vision and the people ofthe United States are determined to destroy the Kingdom of God fromoff the earth. [##Daniel 2:26-47##] But these judgements of God will now begin to restmore fully upon that nation and will be increased upon them year by 
 whole mountains and valleys were alive with men and beast.At 20 minutes past 9 o'clock three rounds ofwere fired from a brass howitzer for the First Presidency of the Church. Other rounds were also firedEach one enjoyed himself as best he could through the day and night. I took a walk with the Presidency to his upper mill There were four built and one building. I never saw finer timberin my lifeAt about noon Bishop A. Smoot Elders Judson Stodard O. P. Rockwell and Judge Smith rode into camp. The two former from the States in 20 days. They informed us that the United Stateshad taken away the mail contract and that a new Governor and Judges and 2,500 troops would start for Utah soon. We went into the President's tent and questions were asked and answered and President Young said that if General Harney crossed the South Passhe should send him word that he must not come into the Valley If the Governor and officers wished to come and would behave themselves they should be well treated. President Young felt determined no more to submit to oppression either of individualstowns counties states or nationsAt daylight next morning the company began to break up to return to their homesWhile in the endowment house President Kimball said he wished me to write an account of the sayings of Joseph the Prophet when he pledged himself that he would not speak on a certain occasion until all the 12 had spoken. So he had to sit three quarters of a day and hear the Twelve express their feelings and he could not say a word. He then said to the Twelve "You have caught me this once; and now I want to give you some advise. Never get caught as I have. Never go into a corner unless you can see your way out in some manner."In the Prayer Circle Sunday August the 2nd 
 as the living and are mixed up the same as the living are in a greatmeasure. Joseph and Hyrum and all the faithful Elders are activelyat work preaching the Gospel to the Spirits in Prison and preparingthem for the coming of Christ. The wicked spirits will gathertogether against Joseph there the same as here but neither theDevil nor the wicked have any power over him there but hecan dispaerse them at his will. Those who have shed innocentblood or consented thereto will be angels to the Devil until theyare disorganized. Our dead children and friends are all withus or near us. We are now in eternity as much as ever weshall be. This great Sermon of President Young was fullyreported and published both in the Deseret News and the Journalof Discourses.We found a great difficulty in writing the latterpart of the History of Joseph expecially the last few days of hislife as no one had kept a Journal of the same excepting DrRichards now dead, and during the last days of Joseph's lifenearly all the Twelve were away on mission. This made mevery desireous to have President Youngs daily History writtenso that all things might be plain to the future Historian.The President told me that George A Smith in speaking ofthe Church History in future said that it would be the Historyof the Church and not of a man. I said very well; we couldnot write the History of the Church without writing the Historyof the Prophet and President of the Church. Brother Youngconversed freely upon the subject. I enquired of the clerksof the President's office what they had written concerning himdaily. They read some to me and I did not think it sufficientlyfull.On the 25th Presidents Young and Kimball wentto the Island in their new boat built at Jordan Bridge. I attendeda meeting of the Agricultral Society in the Bowery. President

 the subject came up concerning the United States sending troops to this Territory. President Young said, "OurOur enemies will perish in their own corruptions. I think it will be well to send some missionaries through the States and tell the brethren to pick up their budgets and come to the Valley and go to England and do the same. Let the brethren do this that go with the mailThe United States are fools to come upon this people and so are thoese men who are bringing great quanties of goods unto us this season. If the United States send out troops to fight us this season we shall whip them out. Then they will send out reinforcements and then we shall have the Lamanites with us and the more the United States send out the worse off they will be for they will perish with famine I do not think anything about guns or powder for if the United States begin war with us I intend they shall furnishus with arms and ammunition all we want. If they do undertake it the Lord will lead them or let them go into a snare and their folly will be manifestGeorge A Smith said if you defeat them you may look for one hundred thousand menPresident Young said "It will be so much the worse for them; but I do not think he will get a great force here for if they get defeated this year the people will be down on Buchannan; but I should not wonder if we heard he was dead soonDaniel H. Wells said this was Buchanan's own measure some time ago"On this same day the 2nd of August I baptized George A. Smith J. M. Bernhisel and Truman O Angel and confirmed them with Franklin D.

 and President Young ^Kimball^ was teaching doctrine. Among other things he said, any man that was a prophet of God was born a natural Prophet. It was through a linage of Prophets: their fathers and mothers were Prophets and propheteses by birth through the sead of Abraham. This was the case with Joseph Brighamand himselfHe then chastized Thomas Ellerback in a very sharp manner for insulting him and trying to take a course to bring a collission between him and Daniel H. Wells. He spoke for more than an hour upon the subject of the clerks in the various offices and his right place and station and the place and station of all the Presidency and other men Brother Thomas asked forgiveness and brother Kimball forgave him and all was settled.I called on President Young and gave him his history to look over from the hand of brother Watt.On the 13th I called upon President Young. He came into the Office and asked if it would not be well to put in the stone into the bottom of the Temple celler and let the men go and save their grain and for each man to take what grain will do him for a year.Daniel H. Wells said that orders had been sent North and South to watch for the sol^diers^ and not let them come in but to destroy them the best way they could. Let grain be chached in the mountains so that they can get at it.President Young said the thought it would be best to secure the grain in the mountains.It was said that Vannetting had 500 lbs of powder coming and he would go out with cattle to bring it in or he would do as he was told. Yes said President Young except a righteous course. President Young said I would rather have a good  powder horn and charger than any flask in the world. He considered it saferThere was a deep feeling pervading our city about 
 had been travelling and preaching a good deal and had not paid anytithing. President Young said the law of tithing reachedevery man. He should pay his tithing if he had to have fivetimes as much from the tithing office in order to live and that all hehad from the Tithing Office should be charged to him and that heshould consecrate what he had to the Church. The President saidhe should consecrate what he had to the Church that his childrenwhen he was dead should not squander his property and go tohell.Indipendance DayThere was quite a military display in Great Salt Lake Citythis day.

 of the enterance of the Pioneers into the Valley. The account thereofis published in the Deseret News July 30th. I was quite lame withthe rheumatism and had been for several weeks.On the 4th of August I learned that one ofour clerks in the Historian's Office namely Jonathan Grimshawwas about to leave us for England. He could not stand thehard times and did not know whether Mormonism was true or notso he was going house; but he had taken a very honourable coursein all his business and dealingsDeath of Strang.I learned from the New York Herald of the death ofJames J. Strang who had broke off from the Church andlead away a party. He was shot by two men who hadbeen his own followers. One ball lodged in the head wentin near the nose and the other in the spine of the backThere was a row in our street on the 4th and one of the Surveyor's were nearly killedPresident Young was with us on the 6th in the Historian's Office three hours and a half in hearing historyread. He asked if there had been any note madeof his meeting in Nauvoo at Joseph's house at the timeHyrum preached the Book of Mormon and Doctrine andCovenants as the Standards while "I took the ground thatthey were of no account to us without a living Prophet andrevelation." I told President Young that I would examineand see. I afterwards found that it was recorded in myDaily Journal.Next day I was reading History and President Kimball called. He said he told brother George A Smithto give me credit in the Church History for what he prints 
 as an omen of the peace and sereneity of Zion in the coming year and thatit would be to Zion calm and serene this New Year's day.On Sunday the 3rd the subject arose about burning up our cityPresident Young said I think we shall use this room for a few years to comeyet I mean to be ready.The subject of the death of Parley P. Pratt ^came up^. A foreboding of his death hefelt strongly in spirit. As he was about to start for meeting He felt thisso much that he said there are some men in this city who thirsts for my blood. Ashe was about to start for meeting this feeling was so strongly upon him thathe did not wish to go. Brother Pollard did not think there was any dangerbut Brother Pratt made him promise that he would protect him until his returnbefore he would leave for the meeting. At this very time Mr McCleanhad taken lodgings adjoining Parley's room and was attending his meetings withloaded weapons seeking an opportunity to kill him. George A Smithadvised Parley P. Pratt not to go to Arkansas but to go direct to Salt Lakeand take care of himself. He told Parley if he went to try to ProtectEleanor and her children he would loose his life; but he did not takecare of himself nor take George A.

Wilt thou curse our enemies and bring judgement upon them that they shall not have power to come into these valleys to disturb us but may we conquer our enemies and may they be destroyed.We thank thee our fFather that we are here in these valleys of the mountains. We thank thee that thou hast blessed the earth for our sakes that thou has caused the desert to blossom as the rose and caused wheat corn and vegitation to go ^grow^ for our benefit. Wilt thou continue thy blessings unto us in these valleys of the mountains. Wilt thou bless the land and the water, the valleys mountains kanyon and streams for the benefit of thy Saints; but may not the wicked or ungodly have any power here but may our brethren who go forth to war with our enemies have power to scatter and destroy them.We pray thee our Father to turn the hearts of the Lamanites even the sons of Jacob unto us that they may do thy will and be as a wall of defence around about usWe now ask thee our Father to accept of this deposit and dedication preserving these records as thou didst the pot of manna hid up by Aaron that they may be preserved to come forth in the own due time of the Lord.

 James Cummings and Luke Johnson concerning matters in Rush ValleyWe concluded to survey it and control matters there according to the Chartergiven us.On Monday the 18th Presidents Young and Kimballcalled upon us in the Historian's Office in the afternoon and we finishedup the History of Joseph Smith and took down an account of BrighamYoung father and family and his grandfather and grandmotherI procured a Utah Mountain Spideror Tarantula which I preserved in a tin box to send with other insectsto Dr Fitch of New York.On the 21st I had an interview with DrJ Clinton just arrived from the States. He gave me an accountof his travels &c. He was with Orson Spencer when he diedOrson was resigned and composed and fell asleep in peace.I also visited the New Historian's Officeopposite President Young's Office.I was still suffering from rheumatism. I tooka slack lime sweet but it did not seem to do me any goodRevelation to President Young of the Eternal Progress of ManIn the Historian's Office on the 23rd while conversing uponeternal progress President Young again stated what he hadsaid on the 9th which I have already recorded. To-dayhe spoke more fully upon the matter. He said he knewby revelation while in England that there would be an eternalincrease in knowledge and that as we now are God once was and thatas he now is we shall be if we continue faithful. "I told thisto brother Lorenzo Snow. While conversing with brotherWillard Richards upon the things of God it came to me thatthe Priesthood is a perfect system of Government.Elder Amasa Lyman spent a short time 
 [FIGURE] 
 with us in the Office in conversing upon the things of the KingdomIn our prayer circle on Sunday evening PresidentYoung spoke upon good manners good breeding and setting a better examplebefore the world than they do before usThe mail came in on the 28th and among the lettersreceived by President Young was one from William Smith. Others werefrom George A Smith John Taylor and several other correspondantsWe found a strong feeling prevailing in the States against Utah. OurDelegates had not presented our Memoriel to Congress and theprobability was that they would not during that sessionBrigham Still GovernorPresident Young on Sunday the 31st preached and phrophesied conceringthe opposition of the Gentiles. He said he was still Governor ofUtah and should be until the Lord saw fit to remove him. Itwas a remarkable discourse and may be found both in the DeseretNews and the Journal of Discourses. This prophescy of PresidentYoung has often been quoted by our enemies at the time ofthe Utah Expedition as a proof that the Mormons wouldreject the Governor sent which they did not and since it hasbeen often referred to and better understood by those who haveexclaimed Brigham is Governor of the People still.On the 2nd of September Heber C. Kimballand myself laid hands upon Amasa Lyman and blessed him. BrotherHeber was mouthOn the 6th I met with Parley P. Pratt and acompany of Missionaries in the Seventies' Hall. Parley P. PrattW. Woodruff Joseph Young Zera Pulsipher A. P. Rockwood andHorace S. Eldridge blessed 24 missionaries 20 of whom weregoing to England and 4 to the States. We also ordained 2Elders and one Seventy. 
 of these mountains. I will burn every piece of timber wood and board in the Valleys of the Mountains. Then do you not think that our Kanyons will be a depôt for the bones of our enemies? I think they will.O Israel can you stand those things? (The shout of "Yes!" from the assembled thousands rent the air]- All you who are willing to follow me in these things raise your hands towards heaven-[There were a sea of hands held up.]-I have had to hold the Indians here for years from destroying the emigrants. I have had to give them many thousands of dollars to keep them from killing the Gentile emigration to California. The United States government now owe me $50,000 in my official capicity and they will not pay me a dime but are sending armies at a great expence to destroy me and this people.But I will now inform them and all people that if they attempt to make war upon me I shall not attempt to restrain them any more but I shall let them do as they pleaseThe United States do not know what they are doing and the merchants in this place do not know when they are selling the blood of this people for gold. They were not going to bring any goods to this place but now that an army of 2,500 men are coming here to destroy this people they can bring a great amount of goods. Let them take heed to their ways.If the United States send an army and a train of goods here I may get a part of the pay which they owe me.I now wish to say to all Gentiles. Send word to your friends that they must stop crossing this continent to California for the Indians will kill them for the emigrants have slaughtered the Indians without any cause or provocationand if the United States make war upon me I shall not attempt 
 Wilford Woodruff spoke to the Missionariesfor a short time and exhorted them to keep a Journal of theirministry every day of their lives. He said I would adviseyou to get all of your blessings written and preserve themIn writing your Journal I dont care of yourkeeping an account of what you eat and drink or where yousleep unless you should be in a desert or in a wilderness or ona mountain and have nothing and then if the beast of thefield or the fowles of heaven come and feed you as the ravensdid Elijah^sha^ then I would have you record that but I do notfeel to enjoyn it upon you to make a record of every official act of your lives. [##1 Kings 17:2-16##] If you baptize confirm ordain orbless any person or administer to the sick write an accountof it. If you will do this the Church can obtain afull and correct accountWe are not apt to think of the importanceof events as they transpire with us but we feel the importanceof them afterwards. We are living in one of the mostimportant generations that man ever lived on the earthand we should write an account of those important eventsand transactions which are taking place before our eyesin fulfilment of the prophecies and revelations of GodThere are a great volume of revelations fulfilling in ourday and as they transpire before our eyes we want a record made of them. If the power and blessings ofGod are made manifest in your preservation from dangerand death you should make a record of it and keep anaccount of the dealings of God with you dailyI have written all the blessings Ihave received and would not take gold for them.I am in the Historians Office and Ifind it very difficult to get or find a record of events 
 to restrain them any longer.the privelge to leave I will give all people in this Territory who wish to leave the privelege to leave. I want all to leave who are not willing to follow me. If there is any of my family my wives who wish to leave I will send my teams and carry them wherever they wish to go. If it is to hell I will drive them to the gate but will not let my teams go into hell but they must turn round and come back but those who wish can enter inI want the people to go to and save all their grain and prepare to cache it up in the mountains but dont let your neighbor know where you put it. I want you to prepare for a seven years siege.Many other remarks were made and reported in full by the reporters and all the congregation of the Saints felt to say Amen to all that President Young saidOn the following Sunday I spent the day at the Tabernacle. Brother Walker spoke in the morning and told of his five year mission to South Africa and his return to America. He was appointed to assist off the Handcart Emigration. He took charge of their baggage which could not get away but wintered in Florence. He started the train this Spring which was on the way and would be here in a few weeks.He was followed by brother Rodgers who had been on a mission to the Sandwich Islands. He said but a few words and then he was followed by President Heber C Kimball who was filled by the power of God and spoke quite lengthy. He said that if the people would do as they were told they never should be driven from the Valleys. If we have to take to our tents at all we will not pitch them again as a resting place until we pitch them in Jackson County. He said that President Young said when we first came into the Valley that we should lay up grain for a seven years famine and we should let the land rest on the seventh year. Brother Woodruff heard it. (Brother Woodruff said it was written.) Now the United States are trying 
 as they pass along so complete as we want to make the History. But ifthe Elders will take pains to write their official acts so that the Historiancan get hold of them it will be a benefit to the Church. The Historyof this Church will remain through time and in eternityElder Parley P. Pratt followed and confirmed what Ihad said. He observed that he had reflected upon this subject foryears to know what a man should write and I have come to the conclusionthat a man should write his official acts in the Priesthood. I amsorry that I have not kept more of a Journal than I have. I wishI had written every man's name that I had ever baptized oradministered unto. It is necessary for us to keep a JournalWMother Lucy SmithOn the afternoon of Sunday the 7th Elder Tripp spoke. Hesaid he had called upon Mother Smith and she clasped himin her arms. (They were formerly acquainted) and she said myson Enoch I am glad to again see you: I am glad to see a managain from Salt Lake. She cried for joy and said shehad desired for two years to be with the Saints in the valleysof the mountains but others had hindered her meaning EmmaThe aged mother of the Prophet Joseph said give my love to Brighamand Heber and all the faithful Saints for my heart is withthem.In the evening after the Prayer Circle BrighamYoung J. M. Grant Wilford Woodruff and all at our circlelaid our hands upon Parley P. Pratt and blessed him: PresidentYoung was mouth. I never heard a better blessing given to man. It was not written at the time but afterwardsan outline was written by Elder Pratt and filed in the Historians oOffice. This blessing was given previous tohis going to the States where he was assassinated as he 
 to force a Governor upon us. We will not receive him. The Lord has said our Governors shall procede out of the midst of us. This is in the Bible. Brother Woodruff turn to it. (Brother Woodruff opened the Bible promisciously and opened directly to the passage in the ##Jeremiah 30:21|30th Chapter of Jeremiah 21st verse)## and read it to the congregation)Many remarks were made by President Kimball all of which are reported.In the Afternoon John Taylor was followed by Daniel H Wells who spoke in the Spirit and power of God concerning Zion the Armies of Israel and the Armies of the wicked. He was ready to fight and defend Zion.August the 26th President Young said I have sent General Harney word that I wish for peace and do not wish to fight anybody but he must not come here with his armies. If he does I shall stop him.The President said to Brother Mathews when you get to California you cannot strengthen us; you must be upon the watchtower. The nation is determined to make us free They are determined to drive us to defend ourselves and become indipendant. The nation is breaking to pieces in spirit. There is no union among them and before the United States get through trying to destroy us they will want to let out the job. I told the people years ago that if they would let us alone we would convert and revolutionize the world; and if they did not let us alonebut undertook to break us up we would spread abroad the faster and do the work so much the sooner; and we will do it. If this nation now makes war upon us we will be free and build up the kingdom of God the sooner. The people have tried all the time to destroy us but they have failed all the timeWhen the Government called for 500 of our men they had no idea that we should comply with their request. This plan was laid to destroy the Saints and 
 was on his way home by ^McLane^At the close of the blessing President Youngremarked: "I am going to take a mission I will name it hereI want to go through this Territory with Heber C Kimball andJ M Grant and I want the Twelve to go. (Brother Parley observedBrother Woodruff the Historian is all of the Twelve here). Brigham said I want to go through among this people and preach theGospel to them if I can get rid of some of the care of mytemporal business. I do not feel that I am in the path ofmy duty to spend so much of my time in attending to temporalmatters. I think more of one soul than I do all thatI have scraped together. I feel that with the assistanceof my brethren I could make a great wake by going throughthis Territory and preaching the Gospel to the people. I feelthat some men ought never to be called upon to do a day'swork but they should spend their time in pereaching the Gospel. They should have a man to take care oftheir families. This should be the case with ParleyP. Pratt. He should spend his time preaching. We should devote our time to the ministry as far as possibleWhen I returned home I found sisterSayers and sister Cobb at my house. Sister Sayers wishedme to bless her as she was going to the States on a missionI laid my hands upon her and blessed her and said thatall should be right with her and that she should be prosperedon her journey and return in peace.Next day I wrote a letter to DrAsa Fitch of New York and sent him a tin box of insectsfrom Utah including one Tarantula 2 bugs called Scorpian's Miller 1 Tobacco-worm miller one small spider andseveral grasshoppers ^&c^On the following day I wrote a letter 
 Thomas Benton then had orders in his pocket to destroy the Mormons if they refused.Jesus said the time would come when we should have to sell our coat and buy a sword. That time has come and we have got to go to and deliver ourselves from our enemies and the Lord will help us He will fight our battles and we shall become an indipendent kingdomI feel well and I will tell you why. If I am right and I know I am and that this people are much nearer their Father's face thean they ever were before. They are united and willing to do the will of God and this causes me to rejoiceThis people now feel to say it is the kingdom of God or nothing. It is not my farm or my house but the Kingdom of God. This is the case with this people. Brother Kimball said Old Buck was now free. The yoke was off his hneck and it would not be on his neck again."On the same day President Young came into the Historian's Office and sent for me for I was at home and I immediately went to the office where I found President Young Daniel H Wells and Franklin D. Richards. As I came in the President said to me have you a team. I told him that I had a pair of small ponies He asked if I could spare them. I hesitated a moment and said Yes sir I can do anything that is wanted. He then said I have a good pair of horses that I want to let you have as you are laboring here. I was taken by surprise for it came very unexpectedly to me. I accepted the horses and was thankful though perhaps I did not say it at the time. Brother Wells went and showed them to me and I took them home. They were a fine large pair of sorrel horses and they were offered 200 bushels of wheat for them that dayPresident Young stayed 3 1/2 hours compiling his history. He remarked that the revelation upon plurality of wives was given to Joseph Smith in 1831. He revealed it to 
 to Sir William Jackson Hooper Director of the Royal Gardens KewLondon. I sent him a tin box soldered up tight containing the blackand yellow Mountain currant of Mr. Hemways, some service-berriesone paper of Muskeet Seed and one paper of Mus^kcrew^. Thelatter I could not describe. The Muskeet grows from ten to 20feet high is a desert shrub grows in dry places has the appearenceof the black locus and has thorns on it resembling the prickly AshI called upon President Young and asked if we shouldsend out Circulars to the Bishops for the cencus. He said oncea year would do. He told me also that we might move intoour new office on the morrowThe New Historian's Office OpenedSep. the 10th 1856On this day we moved the contents of the old Historian's Office ^which was a part of the Tithing Office^ into the New oneopposite President Youngs house. We had three largeSecretaries filled with books and papers: they were 6 feetwide 8 feet high and 18 inches deep besides about 20 otherSecretaries desks tables &c and about 1 cord of papers whichDr Richards and George A Smith had gathered togetherOn the same day Thomas Bullock tookhis leave of us and started on his mission to England. BroLeo Hawkins went with him over the Mountains and spentthe night.Next day President Young went up City Creek andsaw two bears: brother Kesler killed one of themOn the 12th Presidents Young Kimballand grant visited us at the New Historian's Office.Brother Kimball said may the blessing of God rest upon 
 Oliver Cowdery alone upon the solemn pledge that he would not reveal it nor act upon it but he did act upon it in a secret manner and that was the cause of his overthrow.President Young also said that the United States are driving this people to war sooner than is for their good for we are civilizing the Indians and if they would give us time we would give them a knowledge so that when they do fight the Gentiles they would have the judgement and not kill women and children and they who ought not to be killed. There are now many of the emigration on the way to Carson Valley. The Gentile emigrants shoot the Indians wherever they meet with them and the Indians will now retalitate and will kill innocent people. One woman who had fitted out to home here to investigate Mormonism was killed and all her teamsters and all these were killed through the folly of emigrants.On Sunday the 30th of August we had a good day. The Presidency and several others of the leaders spoke In the evening at the Prayer Circle the contempteble speech of Stephen Arnold Douglass was read and the answer of Albert Carrington to the speech was also read. Also the instruction of Governor Young in case we were invaded by an enemy Many remarks were made upon the apparently approaching crisis. President Young said that many of the brethren had many fears about the Lamanites because the Gentiles were making them presents. You need to have no fears upon the subject for if the nation gives them a few million it will not be all that is their due and then they will turn round and take the rest. We need have no fears but what the Lamanites will be prepared to fill their mission. I cannot feel that the time has come for us to do a great deal of hard fighting. We shall have help and strength and the promises of God will be verified unto us.On the 1st of September brother Hamlin 
 this place from this time henceforth and foreverDedication of the Historian's Office.September the 15th 1856I met the brethren connected with the Historian's Officeand told them my feelings was to dedicate the place untothe Lord and so we all knelt down excepting J V Longwho was scribe and I offored up the prayer of which thefollowing is a synopsis"O God our Eternal Father we bowbefore thee this morning beneath this roof for the purposeof dedicating the Historian's Office unto the Lord our GodWe feel this to be our duty; as we consider this to be ablessing unto us that we have the privilege of being locatedin these Valleys where we can worship thee and buildTemples Tabernacles and cities unto thy Holy name andhave none to molest us or make us affraidWe rejoice in the power of the Priesthoodwhich thoue hast given unto thy servants through thepower of which and the mercy of God we are protected andpreserved from the wickedness and abominations of the worldWe thank thee O Lord that the power of the Priesthood andrighteousness governs and controls us and predominates in theseValleys of the Mountains. For these things we fell tooffer up our prayers with thanksgiving.And inasmuch as we have the privelegeof having an Office built for thy servants to occupy whilewriting and keeping a history of the Church and kingdomof God upon the earth in these last days we fell it aprivelege to bow before thee and dedicate this house unto 
 arrived from the Santa Clara Mission with some 12 Indian Chiefs who had come to see President Young. One was the [blank space] Chief. His name is Tots-I-gavets the chief of the Pieds of the Deserts and Santa Clara and Rio Virgin. He had a chief with him of the Indians of hHarmony Kanosh the Chief of the Parvants and Amon Walker's brother. President Young had an interview with the Indians for about one hour. Mr Eddy came into the Office and spent several hours looking at our works. He was the partener of Mr Sharp the inventor of the Sharp's rifles.We had an express arrive on the morning of the 5th stating that Col. Johnson was at Ash Hollow with some 2000 men travelling some 15 miles per day. Col. Sumner had burned some 300 Cheians lodges and killed some few Indians and 2 soldiers were killed and 7 wounded. Sixty men with Captain Jones and the wounded were sent to Fort Kerney and the Chians overtook them and cut them to pieces so bad that no trace of them could be found.Our emigration was getting along pretty well so that the Lord was hearing our prayers and hedging up the way of our enemies. General Harney was retained as the military Governor of KansasThomas B. Marsh Presented to the CongregationSunday the 6th of Sep 1857On this day Thomas B. Marsh former President of the Twelve Apostles was presented by President Young to the congregation for them to look upon and behold the wreck and relic of a man who once was an Apostle and the President of the Apostles but who had apostatized and staid in the world until he had become old a cripple palsied miserable unhappy and worthless so much so that his wife the world and the devil had cut him off as ^of^ no use to anybody He had now come to the Saints for mercy and help. PresidentYoung made a few remarks concerning him and then Thomas

 B Marsh arose and addressed the people for a short time and warned the people not to apostatize and to look to him as an example of misery and one who had suffered the wrath of God in consequence of denying the faith. He wished to be forgiven by the Church. President Young put the vote to the assembly if they would receive him into full fellowship notwithstanding all his heinous sins. All voted to a man to receive him.In the Prayer meeting in the President's upper room in the evening we heard letters read from Samuel Richards Snider H. S. Eldridge and Gooseback. President Young said Brother Bernhisel I presume we shall not have any one in Congress next Winter to present our memorials and interest. (J. M. Bernhisel I think not.) I think it will make some of the people squirm when they hear that I am taking the property which the Goverment has sent into this Territory. Some of our brethren going down to the States met about 60 of the Chians. They were very friendly to them. The Indians stole 800 fat cattle and the rest were driven back to the States so the Army has no cattle with them only for their present use.Some said that they beleived that the Indians who stole the cattle were half Mormons and began to damn them Brother Murdock remarked we are all Mormons here in this company and I dont wish to hear my friends abusedPresident Young said what will the people of Europe think when they come to hear that Brigham Young is at the head of the Viglance Committee in California and the Kansas troubles and that the Government of the United States could not remove him until the Lord saw fit to let them.The world accuse me of controling the affairs of of California and Kansas &c. The people believe that we have a band called the Danites but how could they exist so 
 feel the Spirit of God and the spirit of peace resting upon themwhile they are beneath this roof; and may we understand our dutytowards them in all thingsWe pray thee to hear us and to accept ofthis dedicationWe pray thee also to bless the quorum of theTwelve Apostles the Seventies and all the authorities and quorumsof the Church and bless those of thy Servants who are amongthe nations of the earth and grant that they may be inspiredto send us accounts of their works that we may be enabled tokeep a true and faithful record so that when we have goneinto the world of Spirits the Saints may read be blessed inreading our record which we have kept.We ask thee O God Lord to grant theseour requests and every other blessing which thou see^st^ weneed and in the end of our probation may we be savedin thy Kingdom and the glory of our salvation we will ascribe to God the Father through JChrist our Redeemer: Evenso, Amen.Arrival Of The First Hand Cart CompaniesSeptember the 26th 1856Word was brought in the evening before that two of the Hand-Cart Companies were camped between the two mountains andwould be in to-day. So President Young called togethera body of Lanceers "Ballo's Brass Band" and the "NauvooBrass Band" and with President Kimball General WellsProfessor Carrington and many other citizens hein carriageshe went out to meet them and to escort them intothe city 
 long without sheding blood for we cannot find that they have killed anybody But I do not know of any such menI think that James Buchannan has got into a bad fix. He has got the yoke on his neck and has to carry it alone with no ox to carry the other end. But he is pounding his own shins and will soon pound the shins of others for the moment he gave consent to send an army to destroy this people he placed himself as the shedder of innocent blood and the judgements of God will follow him. When war does break out between the North and the South it will be most bloodyGeorge A. Smith said that the only way for the President of the United States to get out of his troubles was to get a bill through Congress to admit any Territory as soon as they had population enough to organize a State Government and to be received at once into the Union with equal privileges with the other StatesPresident Young then said let me suggest a matter. Brother Smith is presiding at Limhi Salma River. Now do we not want a station half way from here: say near Fort Hall Should we not send men, say 20 to make a station there. (It was thought best to do so). He said the North is the place for us not the South. No one but the Saints would meet the cold North country. This is the key of this continant and I think we had better keep near the lock and have the key in our own handsIf we send a company we want to send them this fall so that we can put in grain this season.On the 8th Captain Van Vleit of the United States service arrived in the city in the evening and he had an interview with Governor YoungOn the next day Captain Van Vleit met with the Governor the Presidency and Twelve and some 100 citizens in the Social Hall at 9 o'clock. He presented Governor Young with a letter of instructions or request which was read before the Assembly and but little said and a great deal thought. 
 They met the companies at the foot of the Little Mountainon the west side of it. Elder Edmund Elsworth son-in-law to Brigham Young was the captain of the first company and Daniel D. McArthurwas the captain of the second company. Both companies consistedof 96 Hand-carts 8 waggons and 486 soulsIt was a very affecting meeting. Presidents Youngand Kimball walked up the Mountain through the company and salutedthe Saints and then organized the company for travelling into the cityOne half of the company of Lancers went in front followed by thePresidency and citizens; then the Marshal of the city Jesse C Little;then the bands of music. After the escort came Captain EdmundElsworth with his Hand-cart Company and then Daniel D McArthurfollowed with the second Hand-cart Company and the remainderof the company of Lancers brought up the rear. In this waythey started for the cityCaptain Leonard Hardy took Bishop Hunterand myself into a buggy and we met the company as they enteredthe borders of the city and we fell into the ranks behind the PresidencyThe people of the city gathered on each sideof the road and the streets. It was affecting to see such astrange sight of about five hundred people enter the city of theGreat Salt Lake who had travelled on foot one thousand fivehundred miles drawing their handcarts all the way. Womenchildren and old men had drawn their bedding clothing and foodall the way and this company of the poor Saints from Englandhad travelled the whole distance in nine weeks. They werecovered with dust and somewhat worn down but cheerful. Theyhad beaten any horse or ox teams during the timeThe Handcart companies passed up onSouth Temple Street, the Deseret Store, by Wilford Woodruff'shouse down to the Grove and then down to the public squareand there formed into two lines and camped for the night. 
 Captain Van Vleit asked if there was lumber to be bought and grain and hay &c. President Young said that there was plenty in the country and asked if there was any one person who could supply Captain Van Vleit with any lumber that he might want Brother Samuel Snider arose and said he could supply 10,000 feet of lumber. No one else said anythingPresident Young had a private conversation with Captain Van Vleit in the afternoon and walked with him through his garden and orchard and through Professor Carrington's. The Captain asked Mrs Carrington if she was willing to cut down her fine peach orchard for her faith and religion. She said yes and would set up nights to do it if it became necessaryOn the next day President Young took the Captain through his house and introduced him to his familyOn the 12th we got an express in the morning saying that there were some 900 troops on the way this side of the Laramie and some 12 Government baggage trains.Captain Van Vleit came into the Office this day and President Young had a good deal of talk with him.He said I do not want to fight the United States but if they drive us to it we shall do the best we can and I tell you as God lives we shall come off conquerer for we trust in God. For God hasset up his kingdom upon the earth and it will never fall but it will stand. We shall do all we can not to fight but if they drive us to it God will overthrow them. If they would let us alone and say to the mobs now you may go and kill the mMormons if you can but we will have nothing to do with it, this is all we would ask of them But for the Government of the United States to array their armies against us it is too dispicable and damnable for any honourable nation and God will have them in derision for doing itThe Government has all the time endeavoured to destroy us in an underhanded manner; but now if 
 As soon as they were camped President Youngstood up in his carriage and called upon the Bishops andmultitude who had gathered together to see the Handcart Companiesto bring them provisions and feed them to night to morrowmorning and noon and night again and while they stop hereI wish you all to tarry here until you are dismissed and I blessyou all in doing good and keeping the commandments of GodWe then returned to our homes andthe Bishops and people brought the Hand Cart companies all the provisions necessaryCaptain Edmund Elsworth saluted his wives andchildren as he passed his house but did not stop for anythinguntil his company was camped. He led the First Handcartcompany by drawing the front handcart with three other^s^breathren drawing their handcarts with him in the frontrankNext day I call upon President Youngupon Church business. Among other things he said hethought these hand cart companyi^es^ had a better time than theteams had. "They have not had as hard a time aswe had in going to Missouri in 1833^4^. Then I wentto Missouri stayed in the cholera 15 days then returned to Kirtland within three months making over 3000 miles which^and^ I walked all the way and lay ^laid^ on the ground every night; butif I had to fit out a company I would have fitted out thecarts different to what they were."During the moring Presidents Young KimballAlbert Carrington Edmund Elsworth and myself rode downto the Public Square to visit the Handcart Companies. Theemigrant Saints generally looked well and cheerful. Theyshook our hands warmly. There was a great quantityof provisions on hand in the camp brought in by the citizensI laid hands upon one of the bretheren who was taken sick 
 they come against us we will whip them all the time and you will see that we will do it. The United States are sending their armies to hold us still until a mob can come and kill us and they have done this all the timeWe are the supporters of the United States Constitution and we love the Constitution and laws of the United States but it is the corrupt administeration of those laws that we are suffering under and not the laws.If the laws had been carried out in the Missouri it would have hung Governor Boggs between the heavens and the earth and all his friends who was in the murdering and expelling of the Saints from the States. They shot down the Mormons whenever they could. They killed Joseph and Hyrum. Then when Col. Hardan came into Nauvoo with his armies he did not enquire who killed Joseph Smith and Hyrum nor any of the Saints who had been killed but enquired for some missing man that we knew nothing about and said he should hold |me responsible for the life of that man.This has been the course with the Government all the time We got up a "memorial" or "Declaration" to the Congress of the United States last WinterThe Declaration was then read to Captain Van Vleit who after hearing it said, "I cannot find any fault with it only it is couched in very strong language." President Young replied, "That is what I intended and I will now ask Captain Van Vleit if Drummond was not the main cause of the United States sending their armies against us?"The Captain said "I think it is;" and the President continued, "There is not any of the Government officers which have been sent here who have any interests with us but they have tried to destroy us.Captain Van Vleit said this is the case with most men in the Territories. They receive their offices as steping stones to the senatorship but they have no interest with the people. This people have been lied about the worst of ^any^ people I ever saw. The greatest hold the 
 during the night. President Young said the people might havetheir handcartsBrother Elsworth pointed out a mule which he rodeafter a Buffalo which he had wounded. The mule took rightafter the buffalo and the mad wounded animal turned andtook after the mule. They almost met together when the^mule^ turned and ran back so suddenly that he threw Elsworth to theground. The buffalo plunged at him and Elsworthpunched the aminal with the mugzgle of his gun in theeye so hard a blow that the buffalo fell to his knees but gotup again and ran away. It broke the rifle. Brother Elsworthwas a very strong man. His mule ran five miles to campand he had to walkNext day was Sunday and several of thereturned missionaries spoke to the congregationThe Place Where Adam Offered His First SacrificePresident Kimball said I have told the people to dayfar greater things than drawing hand carts to Zion JosephSmith took President Brigham Young and myself to the veryspot in Adam-Ondi-Aman where Adam offered up his firstsacrifice on a spot now called HogbackDream of Daniel H WellsDaniel H Wells said I had a dream last night and I saw abutcher's cleaver in the heavens in the East and I tried to ^show it to^ BishopPettigrew and he could not see it. I felt that there was a strugglenear and a great slaughter and much nearer than the peopleare aware ofPresident Kimball said it would be better 
 world have now upon you is they accuse you of burning 900 vols of the United States StatutesThomas Williams who was one of the oweners of the books which were burned denies that there were any of the books of the United States burned.President Young said I have told the people all the time that all I asked of them was to tell the truth about us to pay their debts steal nothing and they are welcome to go their wayNow if this Government has arrived at that Statethat they will try to kill the people for their religion no honourable men should be afraid of them.President Young then told the story about the Qucakerwhom the Yankee went to whip. The quaker said that he was not the man that he wanted. He had not done anything wrong but the man said he would whip him anyhow. So the quaker laid down his hat and coat and said "Lie there religion until I whip this man"and he did whip tremendiously. It will be so with the United States. If they insist in whipping us they will get awfully whippedCaptain Van Vleit, we have treated all men as well as we have you who have been sent here as officers of the the United States Government. We wish still to treat them well and we would like to ward off this blow if we could. But the United States are determined to drive us to fight. We cannot do anything but what the Government will take exception to it. They will kill us if they can. I have proof of this. They killed Joseph and Hyrum in jail notwithstanding the faith of the Governorthe army and the States was pledged to protect them and when they had killed them they got a writ for me. I carried a large bowie knife with and I said that any man who laid hands upon my sholder and said Mr Young you are my prisoner I would send that man to hell across lots. I have said that all the time since and I say it now 
 for one half of the people to be cut off than for the rest to sufferas they had doneDedication Of The Baptisimal FontOctober the 2nd 1856I met with Presidents Brigham Young Heber C. Kimballand Jediediah M. Grant at the House of the Lord for the purposeof dedicating the Baptisimal Font built on the East side of theHouse of the Lord.There were also present besides the Presidency andWilford Woodruff Bishop Edward Hunter Joseph Young Presidentof the Seventies Daniel H. Wells Albert Carrington, LeonardW. Hardy Jesse C Little and Gilbert Clements.Dedication Prayer By Heber C KimballPresident Young called upon Heber C Kimball to bemouth in the Dedication Prayer. The following is a Synopsis of it reported by Wilford Woodruff"O, God the Eternal Father, we bow downbefore thee on this Font which has been made by thy servantsto baptize thy people in, for the purpose of dedicating it untothe Lord our God.We dedicate ourselves before thee O Lordand we ask thee in the name of Jesus Christ to forgive us allour sins, that we may have thy Holy Spirit to guide us inall things that we may be guided in the ways of the Lord andthat we may never do wrong. Look upon us O God whohave now bowed before thee around this Font and help us todo thy will in all things, acknowledge thee in all thingsand honour thee and worship thee at all times. Help 
 I have broken no law, neither will I be taken by any United States officers to be killed as they have killed Joseph. They did once take a bogus Brigham which was brother Miller and took him to Carthage and did not find out his mistake until they got him thereCaptain Van Vleit said I do not think that it is the intention of the Government to take you but to install a new Governor in this Territory.President Young replied "I believe you tell the truth—that you believe this but you do not know their intentions as well as I do. When you get away from here you will think of a great many things which you have seen and heard. The people have all the time accused us of colleaguing with the Indians against the Government and they were much afraid that Joseph Smith would go among the Indians and they watched to keep him away from them but now they have driven us into their midst. Andnow I want you to watch the signs and you will see that God will work against the nation who are trying to destroy both the Indians and the Mormons. The Government has become corrupt and they are the ones who are breaking the Constitution of the United States and if it is ever saved it will be saved by the Mormons who are the Elders of Israel.On Sunday the 13th after John Taylor had spoken President Young followed and said that he had the persecution of the Saints before him all the morning, that he was righteously angry; that he was so angry he could not preach. But he did preach in the power of God and told his feelings.Captain Van Vleit sat by and when President Young spoke of the wickedness and corruption of the Government it made him feel [blank space]At the close of the meeting we met with the Missionaries who were appointed to lecture upon home manufactures. We then went into council with the Presidency to select a company of missionaries to go and make a settlement on Blackfoot Fork 63 volunteered 
 us to honour our tabernacles that we may never disgrace ourselves inanything. Grant unto us thy Holy Spirit that it may quickenour understanding and bring to our rememberance all things which arenecessary for us in the discharge of our duties.We now dedicate this Font to thee O, God. Weconsecrate it unto thee in the name of Jesus Christ. Let thyineangel O Lord touch this water and this Font with his finger thatit may be holy unto the Lord. May no unclean thing everenter into this font to polute it. We dedicate ourselves ourwives children and all that we have unto thee O Lord our GodMay we be thine for ever and all that we haveNow O Lord accept of this dedication atour hands and as we go into this water may our sins be forgivenand not be remembered against us any more. May we feelthe power of God and have power to work a great reformationamong this people; and may this people triumph over ourenemies; and may not our enemies hever again have powerover us. But willt thou cause thine indignation to burnagainst them that they shall not have any power to do thypeople harm.Now O Lord look down upon thy servantBrigham and clothe him with thy power that he may know theworkings of the power of the Devil in the Church and amongthis people; and may he have power to stretch forth hishand unto thy people and do thy work.We now dedicate this font to baptize theliving and the living for the dead and for every purpose whichis necessary to perform the work of the Lord our God even thatthe generations which are dead and passed away may be savedand that the sins of the living may be washed away andthat the sick may be healed of every infirmity that we may be renewed in body and spirit in all things. 
 and 42 of them were chosen.At the close of this Council I went direct to the meeting at the Tabernacle and during the afternoon President Young spoke and gave Uncle Sam considerable hell fire for their wickedness. We then went in-to our Prayer Circle and President Young feasted the brethren upon peaches and grapes as we had nothing to eat during the day. At the close of prayers Captain Van Vleit met us at the stairs and said he had an express from the States and wished to meet with Governor YoungPresident Young's Last, Important Interview with Cap. Van VleitSunday Evening Sepr 13, 1857In the evening I went to Captain Hooper's and met with Captain Van Vleit, and a short time after President Brigham Young Daniel H. Wells A. Carrington Orson Hyde John Taylor and a number of others came in. Captain Van Vleit was preparing to leave at 3 o'clock in the morning and President Young was now to have his last interview with him and he wish^ed^ to talk to him in a plain mannerPresident Young said he wished Captain Van Vleit to report at Washington just as things were here. He said I have seen the sufferings of this people through their persecutions from the people of the United States for the last 25 years and I will not hear it any longer.We have always treated the United States officers well but they have constantly lied about us and tried to destroy us all the time. We would still have received their Governors and officersif they had sent them here without an army; but inasmuch as they are now disposed to send an army here to hold as while others run their red hot iron into us and then kill us we will now say we will not have either their soldiers armies or officers any more here at all and you may tell them so. We will just fight for our liberty and rights from this day forth. 
 Accept of this dedication at our hands O Lordand hear our prayers and we will give all the glory to Godour Heavenly Father; and we ask it in the name of JesusChrist: Amen.After the dedication of the Font President BrighamYoung went down into the water in the Font and baptized PresidentsHeber Chase Kimball and Jedediah M GrantRe-Confirmation and Baptism of the First Presidency and Othersat the Dedication of the Font Oct 2, 1856, at the time of the ReformationConfirmation of Heber C KimballAfter the President had baptized his Counsellors Heber CKimball and J.

If the Government of the United States persists in sending armies to destroy us, in the name of the Lordwe shall conquer them. If the Government calls for volunteers in California and the people turn out to come to destroy us they will find their own building in flames before they get far from home and so throughout the United StatesAgain if they commence the war I shall not hold the Indians still by the wrist any longer for white man to shoot at them; but I shall let them go ahead and do as they please and I shall carry the warinto their own land and they will want to let out the job before they get half through. And even should an army of 50,000 menget into this Valley when they get here they would find nothing but a barren waste.We shall burn everything that is wood and we should burn every acre of grass and you may tell them that they must bringwith them their forage for their horses and mules for they will not find anything to eat in this Territory when they comeAgain you may tell them they must stop all emigration across this continent for they cannot travel in safety. The Indians will kill all who attempt it. You may tell Judge Douglassthat when he comes here again to enter into a treaty of peace we shall dictate those terms of peace and not he as he did beforeCaptain Van Vleit said that if our Government pushed forward this thing and made war against us he should withdraw from the army for he would not have a hand in shedding the blood of American citizensAfter closing his remarks President Young said

We all wished the Captain well.I then went home and put up a box of peaches of 32 dozen for the Hon. J. M. Bernhisel and Captain Van Vleit.I then went to the Historian's Office and from thence to President Young's Office and conversed with President Young Wells and Carrington until midnight. This day J. M. Bernhisel was set apart for his mission to Washington. I wrote his blessingOn the 164th of September in the afternoon President Young met in Council with Heber C Kimball Daniel H Wellsand the Twelve and several others and resolved to proclaim the Territory under marshal law. The Proclamation of the Governor was read and acceptedOn the evening of the 18th an express arrived from the brethren in the Mountains. They brought word that 700 of the army were at the Pacific Springs and that they kept but five men on guard to take charge of their animals and they would not give them guns for fear they would run away. They were travellingabout 15 miles per day. Their animals were much worn downand the feed was scarce. Our own brethren many of them were sick and were living upon bread alone and they wanted provisions sent to themOrders issued the next day for a number of waggons to be fitted out and go with provisions to our brethren in the Mountains. I was called upon for a horse team. Col Harman's regiment was out this day with all their baggage waggons. They

 made quite a displayElder Nathaniel V. Jones arrived on the morning of the 25 from the United States Army with the express. He visited with Captain Van Vleit both regiments. The first was the 10th Regiment. This was a full regiment. The officers were young and full of fire and they swore they would come in anyhow; they could whip out Utah. Captain Van Vleit advised them not to come for they could yet [get] nothing and they would have to fight their way; but they swore they would fight their way through After Captain Van Vleit left them they marched 30 miles the next day.The second regiment they met with were old officersThey considered the matter over more and thought it an imposition to be sent out here and as a political movement to kill innocent people or to get killed. They were to be at the Pacific Springs that night and our brethren were to commence operations upon them.Next day I had some conversation with general Wells upon the subject of going into the Mountains. He said he should soon go and take with him George A. Smith and John Taylor as councillorsHe was going to take but a part of his staff and he wished me to stay at home in the Office for the present. This was according to counsel.The following conversation passed between PresidentYoung and Captain Van Vleit not before recorded in this Journal. Captain Van Vleit said I think that Congress will try to do all they can against you President Young said if God inspires any man to speak for us it will be well We have got to trust in God. If you will speak in favor of us and I think you will the Lord will bless you for so doing. He will require it of you. We have refuted lies so long that we have got tired of it and we shall now trust in God for the future. Congress could send out an investigating committee to Kansas or to any other place but to Utah. Upon the mere rumor of lies they could send out 2000 soldiers to Utah to destroy the people without investigating the subject at allCaptain Van Vleit said the Government may yet send out one to Utah and consider it policy before they get through with it

 President Young said I do think that God has sent you out here and that good will grow out of it. I was glad when I learned that you were coming.Captain Van Vleit replied I am very anxious to get back to Washingtonas soon as I can. I heard officially that General Harney was recalled to Kansas to officiate as Governor. I shall stop the train on Hams Fork on my own responsibility and leave them there.President Young said if we can keep the peace for this Winter I do think there will be something turn up that may save so much shedding of blood. Captain Van Vleit observed I think so too. The troops will have to stop on Hams Fork; for their provisions will be late coming up. I do not think there is more than 1000 troops coming. There is one regiment from the Florida war. There is not more than 300 men They have been reduced by the scurvey. That Florida War has cost many millions of money. It was a speculating scheme. There are not more than 100 Indian warriors and they have got hiding places which no man can find. It is seldom you can kill one. You may accidentally storm ball into one as you would a patridge. Well this Florida regiment are old men and the regiment is worn outSunday the 27th I called upon Elder Taylor to get the History of Joseph which he had written but he informed me we had left it at the Historian's Office the evening before. He was preparing to go into the Mountains with George A. Smith and General D. H Wells and his staff or a part of it. They got ready and left the city about 1 o'clock P.M.On Monday the 28th we received an express from our army in the Moutains saying that our enemies were marching strongly towards us. The brethren tried to stampeded the animals of the army but they found them all chaned by the feet, so they could not run; a small company of our brethren also tried to stampede some oxen and they failed in it.Brother Jones informed me that Captain Van Vleit told the army ^tried to^ 
 made a call for sixty teams twelve tons of flour and 40 extrateamsters to go into the mountains to help in the back emigrationof Hand-cart companies.General Conference of the ChurchheldIn the Bowery Great Salt Lake CityOctober the 6th 1856The Conference commenced at 10 o'clock AMThere were present on the Stand ofthePresidency: Brigham Young Heber C.

 persuade the army to stay on Hams Fork to Winter or in that region but the 10th regiment swore that they had started for Salt Lake and they would go there The Capt. told them we should not let them come in and they would find a different warefare from anything they had met withThe Mountain Meddow MassacreOn the 29th of September Elder John D Lee arrived from Harmony with an expressand an awful tale of blood. A company of Californian emigrants of about 150 men women and children many of them belonging to the mobbers of Missouri and Illinois had been massacred. They had many cattle and horses with them aAs they travelled along South they went damning Brigham Young HeberC Kimball and the heads of the Church saying that Joseph Smith ought to have been shot long before he was. They wanted to do all the evil they could so they poisoned beef and gave it to the Indians and some of them died. They poisoned the springs of water and several of the Saints died. The Indians became enraged at their conduct and they surrounded them on a Prairie and the emigrants formed a bulwark of their waggons; but the Indians fought them five days until they killed all their men about 60 in number. They then rushed into the correll and cut the throats of their woman and children except for some 8 or 10 children which they brought and sold to the whitesThe Indians stripped the men and women naked and left them stinking in the boiling sun. When brother Lee found it out he took some men and went and buried their bodies. It was a horrid jobThe whole air was filled with an awful stench. Manay of the men and women were rotten with the foul disease before they were hurt by the IndiansThe Indians obtained all their property cattle horses and guns &cTheir was another large company of emigrants who had 1000 head of cattle who was also damning both Indians and MormonsThey were afraid of sharing the same fate. Brother Lee had to send interpreters with them to the Indians to try to save their lives while at the same time they were trying to kill us.

The vote was put to the people andbut few voted for it but the great majority against itPresident Young spoke of the necessary of areformation among the peoplePresident Kimball called upon the blacksmithsin the congregation to return home to mend the wagons andshoe the horses of the people so that they might start backupon their expedition to help in the companies.The authorities of the Church were then presentedby President Kimball and sustainedThe 18th Ward was divided and John Sharpwas appointed Bishop to preside over the Twentieth WardPresidents Grant and Kimball addressed thecongregation and President Young then said"I wish to fulfil the promise which I madetwo weeks ago. I then told the people or the females thatI would release them at Conference. I will do so on certainconditions and that is that you will appear forthwith at myOffice and give good and sufficient reasons and then marrymen who will not have but one wife.In the afternoon the returned Elders CyrusH. Waheelock James Ferguson Wm C Dunbar Elder Bunker 
 We spent most of this day getting the brethren ready to go into the Mountains.Brother Brigham while speaking of the cutting of the throats of women and children as the Indians had done South said that it was heartrending that emigration must stop as he before saidBrother Lee remarked that he did not think that there was a drop of innocent blood in the camp of the emigrants who were slain by the Indians. He had two of the surviving children and he could get but one to kneel in prayer time and the other would laugh at her for doing it and the^y^ would sware like piratesAn express came in at night saying that the troops were near Bridger and had formed into three bodies in travelling. General Wells sent word for the brethren to let them come on to Ecko Kanyon and there give them battle.At 6 o'clock on the morning of the 30th the drums beat and an army of soldiers paraded the streets some 400 who were in readiness to march at a moments notice to the seat of war. We had at this time about 800 men in the mountains. It was a solemn time the armies of the Gentiles were making war upon us because of our religion and we had to defend ourselves against a nation of 25,000,000 people and the war had just commenced. We had to trust in God for the result. We were resolved to do thewhat we could and leave the work in His hands. There was a solemnity resting upon our city this morning; all were anxiously awaiting the arrival of the expressI told President Young that I was on hand at any moment to go into the mountains when he would say the word. I went up in the evening to the President's Office and learned that the California mail had arrived. I heard some letters read, one stating that the Governmenthad made arrangements to send up light drauht boats up the Colorado river with men and arms against us from that pointNext morning October the 1st I arose early and looked for an express signal flag but saw none. There

D Richards and Others.At the close of the meeting I went to the Font and the Houseof the Lord to assist in baptism and confirmation.Elder Franklin D Richards went into theFont and baptized his brethren the missionaries who had beenwith him and their families and Elder Lorenzo Snow and myself confirmed them. ^About 65.^On the 7th Conference was called to order byPresident Kimball who rebuked those who were in the habitof leaving during service or talking at meeting and he said"You may say I am severe. I am nothalf as severe as the Lord wants me to be. I have seenJoseph when men were in Council meetings with him androse to leave cut them off from the Church before they gotout of the door. You tramel the Spirit and it is grievedwith the confusion and interuption. If you do not believethis get the Spirit of God and come on this stand andattempt to talk to the peopleDuring the day a number of theReturned Missionaries spoke and it was resolved thatthe Returned Missionaries should stay with their families 
 was a good deal of anxity through the day waiting for an expressIn the latter part of the day I called at the President's Office and found President Brigham Young Heber C Kimball Albert Carrington George D. Grant and William Kimball and an Express arrived from Col Little giving an account of the number of soldiers which were with him and about Echo Kanyon. As soon as we had got through reading his letter an expressarrived from General D. H. Wells J. Taylor and G. A. Smith sent by JosephA Young and Joseph ^James W.^ Cummings saying that they had sent an express to theUnited States army containing governor Young's orders for them to surrenderall their arms and baggage to Lewis Robinson Quarter Master Generalat Fort Bridger or to retreat back to the States or we should resist themThe U.S. army was encamped on Ham's Fork. The Brethren werewaiting an answer to their message and would send an express in assoon as they got it.I spent the 5th in the President's Office. He heard a part of the account of the death of Joseph by John Taylor. He said whatthere was necessary to put into Joseph's History and the rest to go as JohnTaylor's History.General ConferenceOctober th[e] 6thOur Conference this year of course was very materially thrown out ofits amout of business and importance by the circumstances of the waragainst the Saints and the number of our brethren in the Mountains todefend our cause our people and our homes. The Conference lasted two days and then closed. The time was mostly occupied by the Missionaries and the Twelve and President Young spoke at the closeof the meetings of the ConferenceLot Smith Burns U.S. Waggons.On the 8th we got an express saying that a company underLot Smith had burned up 50 of the Government waggons and 
 while they were burning General Harney and his cavalry came up. Lot Smith's company had gone East to burn up what they could. It was thought that there would be decided action soonOn the 13th the brethren came in from the East and brought in 153 head of cattle. Three teamsters and one deserter from the army helped to drive them in. The deserter reported that neither Johnson Harney nor the Governor or Judges nor any of the Territorial officers had arrived at the army nor any females. He said the soldiers were only allowed 3 buiscuts 2 cups of coffee and a small piece of beef per day and that they were not half fed. He said they had 75 waggons burned and the contents of 76. Two waggons were saved. Captain Lot Smith saved all the private property of theteamsters and when the waggons were burned they gave back the teamsters all their arms amunition &c. One brother had his knee shattered by the accidental discharge of a yawger. They had to carry him on a litter a long distance. He suffered much with it.The Sanpete company arrived in the city on the 12^14^th comprising 100 men and 11 baggage waggons. They marched five men abreast. Col Rockwood informed ^me^ that there were 1100 men of our soldiers in the Mountains and 700 camped on the Public Square and that we could raise 1500 hmen in this city. iIn 15 hours we could place 3000 armed men in Echo KanyonAn express arrived at 25 minuted to 6 o'clock brought by Brother Joseph ^A^ Young Jr. Benjamen Stringham brought ^a letter^ from General Wells stating that numbers of the U.S.army wished to desert and come into the Valley if they had protection The army was weakning daily. The chief officers sent a very polite note to Governor Young acknowledging the receipt of the Deseret News which he had sent them.Captain Lot Smith had gone East upon his mission in watching for the interest of Utah. The enemy 
 were mostly hemed in but no disposition manifest to shed blood on e[i]therside. The enemy were in a close place and their provisions fast diminishing and but little prospects before them but starvation. We had prayed that the Lord would lead them into the pit which they had dug for the Saints and the Lord had heard our prayers and our enemies were now in the pit and a fair prospect of their being destroyed without our shedding their bloodLetters From Col Alexander to President YoungOct 16thAn express arrived this morning bringing a letter from Col Alexander to Governor Young concerning the present state of affairs also a letter from General Wells.The brethren had taken a herd of cattle of 700 head and were bringing them in. It was reported in the army that Col. Johnson would soon be up with 700 cavalry but this was uncertainCol Alexander's letter was rather severe and threatened us with extermination if we opposed. He considered himself able to come in and carry out the commands of the Government.Governor Young sent him a strong answer asking him why he stayed in camp on Hams Fork for a month if he considered he had force enough to carry out his orders. He gave him to understand that it was now the Kingdom of God and the Kingdom of the Devil and we trusted in God for success and should go aheadIn turning from this subject to little children President Young said when some people have little children born at 6 or seven months from pregnancy and they live a few hours and then die they bless them name them &c but I dont do it for I think that such a spirit will have a chance of occupying another Tabernacle and develop^ing^ itself. This is new doctrine, yet it looks consistant. What period of demarcation or age the spirit would take another body we were not informed.Sunday the 18th we met in the Tabernacle and heard The Correspondence of Col. Alexander to Governor Young 
 The correspondence was very rich and edifying. President Young then preached to the assembly in a very profitable manner. He said he should prepare for the worse^t^ and should have grain casched where the enemy could not find it and be prepared to move into the mountains and burn all. Yet he believed we could keep our enemies out and still raise crops in the Valley. He was followed by brother Kimball who said that he knew that if we would hearken to counsel that we should raise grain eat peache^s^ and apples and live in our houses in the Valleys until we went to Jackson County. President Young said I believe itAn Express arrived at 1 P.M of the 18th and brought a letter to President Young from Daniel H. Wells and one to me from George A. Smith. They informed us of anAn Adventure of Captain Lot Smithwho with his company came near being caught in a trap by the enemy in the following manner. About daybreak they came near the enemy's camp and thought they saw a drove of mules a distance from the campThey made a charge upon them to stampede them but as they rushed in among them they found they were mounted dragoons. The captain of the company sulated [saluted] and said Captain Smith you cannot see very good this morning. Captain Smith replied I can see as well as you can with your blind bridles on. They looked at each other awhile then Lot Smith trotted off at a slow pace but the enemy tried to surround them and they had to gallop over a very rough place to get away. When they got about 30 rods away the enemy dismounted and took a dead rest and shot about 30 bullets at them. One ball passed through one of the brethren's hats and another ball grazed a horse's leg That was all the damage which was done. This was the first firing on either side and this was done by our enemies; but no blood was shed except it was the blood of a horse's leg.Col. Burton with a company of dragoons or 
 minute men arrived in this city in good health and spirits. President Kimball addressed them a short time and said by virtue of the office which I hold I bless you in the name of the Lord and if you will live your religion and do right you shall none of you fall by the hand of an enemy but you shall eat peaches and apples in this Valley until you go to Jackson County Missouri and your enemies shall not conquer you. Keep your guns and firelocks in good order and do not waste your ammunition for naught. It is not a day for much preaching but a day for hard service. This is not much that we have to meet with this fall but next year we must be prepared for work. General Grant followed with few words and told them where to go for quarters and they went to their various places allotted themOctober the 21st brother Atwood arrived in the morning bringing an express from General Wells and 2 letters from Col Alexander who closed his letter by saying that "he should not obey the Governor's orders and his final disposal of the troops would depend upon grave considerations which I do not deem necessary to enumerate."The messenger said that the 5th regiment had stopped near Bevear River in tents and the 10th regiment had moved back on Hams Fork five miles with all their teams and baggageThe were in the snow several inches deep. The brethren travelled several miles with the army. The men were so weak and cold they would wrap up in their coats and lie down in the snow to rest almost every mile.We could not tell what the intentions of the officers were. President Young was of an opinion that Col Alexander's intention was to come nearer our camp so that his men might desert Col. Robert Burton said that it was 80 miles from Alexander's command to the mouth of Echo Kanyon. President Young said "here are the officers around me and I will call a council of war. He then said:"I think it is best for General Wells to call in all his forces to Echo Kanyon and there rest and not ride his horses to death unnecessarily 
 but let the enemy alone now and they will soon use themselves up. Keep a few to watch their movements and let them work and they will soon all be used up.Dr Hickman was with the 5th regiment and Allen and his companions with the 10th regiment. Heber C. KimballJr sent Col Alexander a doz. onions and the Col. said that if he had anything that Heber wanted he would send it to him. He asked Beaty why he tryed to stampede their animals and burn the grass. He said "we burn the grass to get a better crop next year.On this day the 21st some 700 or 800 head of cattle were drove into the city taken from the U.S. army. They were accompanied by some teamsters and soldiers who looked poor and hungry.President Young's Veiws of the Way to Conquer the SaintsIn conversation on the 24th upon the events of the time President Young said he was satisfied that we could live in this Valley and raise crops and keep our enemies out. It is not in their power to overthrow us. By the help of God we can remain here and they cannot conquer us. I have reflected this over in my mind to see what way I could conquer this people if I was there; and I cannot see but one way and that way they will not attempt to take. The United States have spent three millions of dollars this season to fit out an army to destroy us and it has done us no harm. But if I was going to attempt to destroy this people I should have let them have their Post Office made one million dollars of appropriation given them all they asked for then spent another million in carrying in Gentiles and merchandize and kept this up yearly until I had filled the country with Gentiles but the Lord would not let them do this. I should know I could not conquer them by force and they will find it outPresident Young got a letter to-day from Gen Wells who said the enemy have returned back on Ham's Fork some 15 miles 
 On the 25th Elders John Taylor and George A Smith arrived from the head quarters of the army and met in council with us. President Young upon the subject of the war said I mean to send word to the United States that if they have sent troops here the cattle which we have taken I will give them credit for upon compound interest but I do not know that they have sent any. They have not notified me officially and I have not right to know anything about it but shall treat them as a mobOn the 26th Brother Peter ^W^ Conover and Oliver Smith arrived and called upon President Young with news from our Carson Valley company The Carson Valley Saints and those from California and Oregon were on their way to this City. They had 160 fighting men with 2700 lbs of amunition belonging to the Church with a great deal of private propertyand a large amount of arms. All the Saints were coming from Carson Valley. They left only 2 boxes of caps and 1 lb of powder in all Carson Valley. The people sold all their arms and amunition to the brethren for their placesPresident Young received a letter from General Grant. The U.S. army were still on Hams Fork and had not decided which route they would take. Our brethren had got the chief waggon master in custodyThe Presidency and Twelve were in conversation all the forenoon at his office on the subject of the war. President Young said that the United States Government were loosing their national greatness, and wisdom was departing from them. We need not ^have^ as much needto fear ^of^ them as we should ^of^ an army of grashoppers. If they take away our charter from us and divide our Territory it will be unconstitutional as everything is which they do against us. I told brother Bernhiselthat if they took away our Charter to come immediately home as soon as he could and we would organize our State Government and fall back upon our original boundaries. Our East boundary should be as far as Laramie and our West boundary the summit of the Siere Nevada and run to the Pacific Ocean and we would defend it. The United States may do as they please. We will 
 do as the Lord wants us.One young officer of the army said that old Jesus Christ could not keep him out of  Salt Lake City but they will find out who rules on earth and in the heavens. Another officer said the United States would wipe us out another year. Should they send an army of 20,000 men it would take more than 20 miles for their army and train to moveat all and the more there is of them the worse off they will be.Brother Taylor said will not the army go into Winter Quarters and entrench themselves and remain until they get help from the States? President Young said if an army comes to help them in the Spring we will use them up this army first and then we willus[e] up the other before wthe^y^ get to the South Pass. In the Spring we must ask Alexander what he intends to do, inform him that he must not stay there until he gets reinforcements in the Spring and if they will not leave in the Spring ^we^ will use them up as best we can in ten days. We can put two thousand men around them who cwould soon use them up. I do not believe they will have 500 fighting men in the Spring. They are in a very critical situation. I think it is better to let them alone this Winter. They will die many of them and others desert and many be weakened with the scurvey and in the Spring we will wipe them out if necesary if they dont go away. We do all our business in the name of Israel's God and they in their own way. The whole matter can be sumed up in these few words. We are here at home by our own fireside while they are a great way from home. I intend to send those teamsters to the South where they cannot get back to the army.By express on the 28th we learned that the enemy had not moved for several days but were waiting for Col Johnson to come up with four companies of cavalry and two companies of infantry. This however was but from report and not authorityIt was decided in council that General Wells John Taylor 
 Elder Woodruff wanted the Elders to remember in their travels that there was a printing press in Nauvoo, that it is in the hands of the church, & it is wished that the Elders would get Subscribers for the papers, & pay collect pay for them & forward itto the Editor, in cash, & not spend the money & then pay in [Conblin's] Labor, cayenne pepper, & old clouts. and when the Elders build up churches they are requested to write a brief statemets of the facts & forward them to the Editor.—post fee.— & 
 Elder W. Woodruff arose and addressed the Assembly from Amos ##Amos 3:7|3 ch. 7 v.## "'Surely the Lord God will do nothing but he revealeth thehis secret unto his servants the prophets.'Aaccording to the testimony of the scriptures in all ages of the world, whenever God was about to bring a judgment upon the world or accomplish any great work, the first thing he did was to raise up a Prophet, and reveal unto him histhe secretts, and send him to warn the people so that they may be left without excuse.This was the case in the days of Noah and Lot:  God was about to bring judgments upon the people, and he raised up a ^those^ prophets,and ^who^ warned them ^people^ of it; yet they gave no heed to them, but rejected their testimony; and the judgments came upon  those ^the people^ so that they were destroyed, while the prophets were saved by pursuing the cours marked out by the Lord. [##Genesis 6##] Jesus Christ testified to the Jews of the things that awaited them as a nation—the fall of Jerusalem, and their dispersion among the Gentile world; but they did not believe it.  Yet the secret of all these things were revealedto the Prophets and Apostles; and they believed it, and looked for its fulfilment; and it came to pass as it was predicted, though contrary to the expectation of the Jewish nation.  In like manner do we look for the certain fulfilment of those tremendous events upon the heads of the Gentile world, which have been spoken of,and pointed out by all the Holy Prophets and Apostles since the world began, they having spoken as they were moved upon by the Power of God and the gift of the Holy Ghost: events which more deeply concern the Gentile world, than the overthrow of Jerusalemand the dispersion of the Jews did the Jewish nation; for while 
 17they stumbled at the stone they were broken, but when it falls upon the heads of the gentile world it will grind them to powder. & andThe full set time is come for the Lord to set his hand to accomplish these mighty events, and ^as^ he has done as he in other ages, so hashe done now—he has raised up a prophet, and is revealing unto him his secrets: through that prophet he has brought to light the fulness of the everlasting gospel to the present generation, and is again once more for the last time establishing his Church upon the foundation of the Ancient Apostles and Prophets, Jesus Christ being the chief corner stone.  In the Church is now found Judges as at the first, and Councillors as at the beginning; the Church is composed of ^also^ Apostles,  Prophets, ^Evangelists^, Pastors, and Teachers, ^with^ gifts and grace, for the perfecting of the saints, the work of the ministry, and the edifying of the body of Christ.  The Lord has raised up his servants,and sent them into the vineyard ^to prune it^ once more for the last time—to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ, and to warn the nations that they may be left without excuse in the day of their visitation; also to gather the honest in heart, and the meek of the earth, that Zion may be built up, and ^the sayings of^ the prophets fulfilled.One of the secrets that God has revealed unto his prophet inthese days is the Book of Mormon; and it was a secret to the whole world until it was revealed unto Joseph Smith, whom God has raised up as a Prophet, Seer, and Revelator unto his people.This record contains an account of the Ancient inhabitants of this continent, and of the cities with which they overspread this land from sea to sea, the ruins of which still remain as standing mon-uments of the arts, science, power and greatness of their inhab ^founders^.It also points out the establishing of this our own nation, with its progress, decline, and fall; and those predictions contained in the Book of Mormon—the stick of Joseph in the hand of Ephraim— will as truly be fulfilled as those contained in the bible—the stick and record of Judah; and both these sticks or records contain prophecies of great import concerning the gentile nations,and especially this land and nation, which are not yet fulfilled,but must shortly come to pass; yea, their fulfillment is nigh even 
 at the doors. [##Ezekiel 37:15-20##]Though the secrets which God is revealing through his servant the Prophet in these last days may be unpopular, and unbelieved in by the world, yet their unbelief will not make the truth of God of none effect any more than it did in the days of Lot and Noah,or at the fall of Jerusalem. When Jesus Christ said there should not be left one stone upon another in the Temple that should not be thrown down, the Jewish neation did not believe it, neither would they receive such testimony; but they looked at outward circumstances, and were ready to say, "who can prevail against us?What nation like ^unto^ our nation? We have held the giving of the law,the articles, ^&^ the Urim and Thummim; the Lawgiver has never departed from between our feet: we have held the power of government fromgeneration to generation; and what nation hath power now to prevail against us?" [##Matthew 24:1-2##] Through the order of reasoning they were blinded, and knew not the day of their visitation—they understood not the things that belonged to their peace—they rejected their Lordand King, contended against his word and testimony, and finally put him to death on the cross, with many who followed him. But this did not hinder the fulfillment of the  his predictions concerning that nation; the words of the Lord had gone forth out of his mouth, and could not return unto him void. The things that belonged to their peace were hid from their eyes, and they were counted unworthy as a nation; the Kingdom was to be rent out of their hands, and given to another; the die was cast, and judgment must come.Jerusalem was soon surrounded by the Roman Army, led on by the inspired Titus; and a scene of calamity, judgment and woe immediately overspread ^the inhabitants of^ that city which was devoted to destruction—such a calmity as never before rested upon the nation of Israel. Blood flowed through their streets, tens of thousandsfell by the edge of the sword, and thousands by famine. Women were evil towards the Children of their own bosoms in the straitness of the seige, the spectacle of which shocked the Roman soldiersas they entered the city. The Jews were crucified in such numbers by their enemies that they could find no more wood 
 19for crosses, or room for their bodies; and while despair was in every face, and every heart sinking while suffering under the chastening hand of God, their enemies rushed upon them in the city to strike the last fatal blow; and as their last resort, they rushed ^for safety^ into the Temple, which was soon on fire, and they sunk in the midst of the flames with the cry of their sufferings ascending up on high, accompanied by the smoke of the crackling ^spires and^ towers. The remaining miserable few were sold as slaves, and driven like the dumb ass before his burthen, and scattered as corn is sifted in a seive, throughout the gentile world.Jerusalem was razed from its foundations, the ^ruins of the^ Temple thrown down, and the foundation thereof plowed up that not one stone was left upon another. Christ said that Jerusalem should be trodden down of the gentiles until the times of the gentiles be fulfilled, which has been the case to the very letter until the present generation. Will not God in like manner as truly and faithfully bring to pass those great, important,and tremendous events upon the heads of the gentile world, which have been proclaimed by the Prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, and many of the ^other^ Holy Prophets; also by Christ and the Apostles on the continent of Asia, as well as ^by^ Lehi, Nephi, Alma, Moroni, and others on this continent?; all of whom have proclaimed these things as they were moved upon by the spirit of inspiration,the power of God, and the gift of the Holy Ghost?The Apostle says that no prophecy of the scriptures is of any private interpretation, and the commandments ^came not^ of olden time by the will of man, but holy men of God spake as they were moved upon by the Holy Ghost. Isaiah's soul seemed to be on fire, and his mind wrapt in the visions of the Almighty, while he declared in the name of the Lord that it should come to passin the last days that God should set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his people, assemble the outcasts of Israel, gather together the dispersed of Judah, destroy the tongue of the Egyptian sea and make men go over dry shod, gatherthem to Jerusalem on horses, mules, swift beasts, and in chariots, [##Isaiah 11:11-15##] 
 20and rebuild Jerusalem upon her own heaps; while at the same time the destruction destroyer of the Gentiles will be on his way; and while God was turning the captivity of Israel, he would put all their curses and afflictions upon the heads of the gentiles their enemies,who had not sought to recover but to destroy them, and had troddenthem under foot from generation to generation. At the same time the standard should be lifted up, that the honest in heart, the meekof the earth among the gentiles should seek unto it; and that Zion should be redeemed, and be built up a Holy City, that the glory and power of God should rest upon her, and be seen upon her; that the watchman upon Mount Ephraim might cry, "arise ye and let us go up unto  the Zion, the City of the Lord our God"; [##Jeremiah 31:6##] that the gentiles might come to her light, and kings to the brightness of her rising; that the saints of God may have a place to flee toand stand in holy places while judgment works in the earth; that when the sword of God that is bathed in heaven falls upon Idumea or the world[##Isaiah 34:5##]—when the Lord pleads with all flesh by sword and by fire, and the slain of the Lord are many—the saints may escape these calamities by fleeing to the places of refuge likeLot and Noah.Isaiah in his ##Isaiah 24|24 ch.## gives something of an account of the calamitiesand judments which shall come upon the heads of the gentile nations, and this because they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinances, and broken the everlasting covenant. The Apostle Paul says to his Romanbrethren that if the gentiles do not continue in the goodness of God,they like the House of Israel should be cut off. Though Babylon says, "I sit as a queen and ty am no widow, and shall see no sorrow", the Revelator says, "therefore shall her plagues come in one day; death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire, for strong is the Lord God who judgeth her". [##Revelation 18:2-8##] Jesus communicated the ##Luke 13:6-9|parable of the fig tree## which in putting forth its leaves betokens the approach of summer; and so likewise when we see the signs in the sun, moon and stars, and in the heavens and the earth of which he spoke, we might know that his coming is near—that the generation in which those signs appeared should not pass ^away^ 
 until all should be fulfilled.These things are about to come to pass upon the heads of the present generation, notwithstanding they are not looking for it, neither do they believe it; yet their unbelief will not make the truth of God of none effect; the signs are appearing in the heavens, and on the earth, and all things indicate the fulfilment of the Prophets; the fig tree is leavfing, summer is nigh, and the Lord has sent his angels to lay the foundation of this great and important work. Then why should not God reveal his secrets unto his servants the Prophets, that the saints might be led in paths of safety, and escape those evils which are about to engulf a whole generation in rain. 
 The people again assembld at 6 oclok oclock in the evening  prayer by OrsonPratt W. Wooduff addresed the people & spoke of the great variety that was manifest in all the works of God both in heaven & on earth which addded greatlyto the interest & glory of God but all governed by the same spirit, power &Law, so with the preaching of the Elders of this church, they treat upon a great many of subjects but all by the same spirit & unto edification exhortedparents to see that their children stored their minds with useful reading, esspecially with the prophesies & revelation of God, that any personwho studies the Bible Book of Mermon & Doctrine & Co[v]enants thoroughly will be far more prepared to follow the Living Oracles & obey ther Council than one who does not. Even Jesus Christ when he descended frm Heaven into the midst of the Nephites He spent most of his time in preaching wholechapters out of the scriptures to them. Exhorted the Elders to keep a journal & Hisory of the Dealings of God with them. Requested the young men tobecome thoroughly acquainted with Phonography that they might become reporters to record the great things that God would manifest unto them in various ways in there day & generation. exort Exhorted the people to give heed to the strong teaching & council which they had received during this conference.  many other remarks were made & subjects refered to by the speakerA few closing remarks were made by Elder Orson Pratt. 
 After devotional exercises, brother Allen W. Woodruff addressed theConference. He was pleased to meet with a Conference of the Saintsfor the first time in this Territory. Read from the Doctrine andCovenants part of a revelation given to Thomas B. Marsh con-cerning the Twelve. He never met with the Saints in Conferencebut vwhat he reflected upon the position they occupied with theier Godeach other and the world. We little comprehended the responsi-bilities that rests upon us as Apostles, seventies, elders and saints.Every prophet from father Adam down had spoken of this greatlast dispensation. Adam 3 years before his death spoke of allthat should transpire untill the millenium. [##Doctrine and Covenants 107:53##] Isaiah had writtenour history in coming up to these mountains. The Lord hasreserved spirits to tabernacle in this last dispensation. Abrahamwas chosen to stand at the head of Israel. [##Genesis 12:1-3##] Has the Lord set hishand to build up this kingdom at random? No. God hadreserved spirits to come forth in this last dispenseation. JosephSmith was reserved to open it up, and the apostles, seventiesand hundreds of others had been kept back in the spirit worldfor 6000 yeears to come forth at this time. Others were inspiredto do their part in starting certain principles or performcertain works, such as Calvin, Columbus and the establishersof this free and independent government. When the Gospel cameto the world it took one of a family and two of a city and the the hand of God was in this. We recieved the priesthood inthe spirit world, now has come our time, and what has Godfor us to do? What manner of men had we ought to be. Refer-rel to Moses day, how few men held the priesthood in hisday, now 999 of every 1000 of the males in the Church holds 
 — 2 —the priesthood, either Melchisedek or Aaronic. These havethe Gospel to preach to thier fellow men. Spoke of his ownlabors, and of the apostles and elders in this respect. JosephSmith, Brigham Young and the elders would judge this gen-eration. Joseph Smith had sealed his testimony with hisblood and went into the spirit world to unlock the prisondoors. Referred to the twelve fulfilling the revelation, requir-ing them to take leave of the saints in Far West, on the 26thday of April 1839. After fulfilling this mission the lorddevillaid his hand upon them, ^tried to hedge up their way,^ but after having got on thewater on their way to England, he left them and they wentforth and brought many to a knowledge of the truth. Afterawhile the Lord revealed the law for the redemption of thedead, and they went forth rejoicing in it, but soon afterthe Lord said for them to keep a record, and not tohave males baptized for females &c. Joseph had conferredthe keys of the priesthood which he held upon the twelve,The people were called upon to build temples and whenwe get an oppertunity we should redeem our dead. He thenspoke upon the sealing ordinance, how we Lords of creationwaked up one morning without any wives or children,and the Lord revealed the laws of the Celestial Glory to Joseph Smithand the Lord says to the apostles and elders obey this law oryou will be damned. All the heavenly host are gazingupon this congregation, and the saints living in thesemountains to see what we are going to do. Spoke of the Laman-ites and the work we have to perform among them and howthier minds had been changed from war to peace. We arecalled upon to build up Zion, we have to cultivate our fields,and build our houses, fences, ditches, &c. this pertains to itand we can not do it all in one day. Zion will continueto grow. The priesthood should not set their heart upontemporal matters, or the things of this world, and no oneshould use the priesthood to build themselves up in thisworlds goods. We ought to dedicate our labors, our fields, &c, and ourselves unto the Lord. We have been called upon 
 — 3 —to enter into the United Order as near as we could The apos-ltes have felt we would have to come to this. He liked what hesaw in these two settlements (Sunset and Brigham City)and said God bless us, and would feel under condemnationas an elder if he should say to us stay your hand, and un-till the Lord reveals a better plan. he said go ahead. Hethen referred to how much less chance there is for temptationin this way of being united in our farming and living togetherand when men were called on missions, thier families wouldnot be left in want to suffer, but would be provided for;the same with men who died. He was only a visitor hereand did not pretend particularly to dictate or direct hisbrethren that were called upon to preside here. We had his prayers in our behalf. 
 Brother Allen ^W Woodruff^ said Zion is going to spread forth. Hehad seen the persecutions the Saints had passed through, yetZion had not gone backward. The Lord will cut his work shortin righteousness. Let every man offer up his prayers to theLord of Sabaoth, and when 100,000 elders offer up thier prayersin faith, they will not go unanswered. We have the Lord onour side. Was glad to hear of the spirit of union amongus. The earth is our home and we should so live thatwe will be prepared to live, upon it when it becomessanctified. May the Lord bless the children who aregrowing up, who never saw babylon. Counselled the youngto marry when they were old enough. 
 Brother Allen ^W. Woodruff^ said the Lord had chosen the weak thingsof the earth to confound the wisdom of the world. Spoke uponthe erroneous ideas of the world regarding God. Thisere is butone Gospel revealed for the salvation of the human family.Joseph Smith knew the principles he brought forth were notof himself but of God. If we build up Zion or administer inany of the ordinances, it is by the gift and power of God. Thereis no difference between an apostle, seventy or elder in this agefrom any other age, to preach the Gospel. The apostles and greatmen were chosen from those who walked in the most humble 
 walks of life. The Savior will come when even the Saintslook not for. Let us unite together and carry out the coun-sels we have heard. Spoke upon the education of ourchildren. The mothers of Israel should pray and learn theirchildren to pray, and our children should grow up fullof faith. The aposles and elders are passing off, and theresponsibility of bearing off this Kingdom would rest uponthe rising generation. Every one would recieve the Glory helived for. He would like to be asociated with Adam andall the great and good men, when he leaves this world. Ourobject is to work for our own salvation and the salvation ofour fellow men, and we need the spirit of the Lord to guideus safe through. Let us labor while the day lasts. Desiredthe Lord to bless those called to preside over us, and those whowere called to labor in the priesthood and the parents andchildren. 
 Elder Lewis Allen ^Apostle W. Woodruff^ was pleased to meet with his brethren and sisters inconference. President Young had said the Latter-day Saints would yet needhomes in Arizona. Had accomplished in Utah what we have by theblessings of God and by faith and so we would in this land. We areblessed here and hoped we would keep our minds on the business ofthis meeting and leave out all outside matters from us. There is greatenmity among the children of men against the people of God, notwith-standing this, those who fear God and keep his commandments are ablessed people but those who are not of us will hate us. In reading thehistory of the world we find that 1/4 of the inhabitants of the earth have beenslain in battle, and about 3 years in 4 been occupied in war, and theLord will destroy the wicked by war. Zion will rise and Babylonwill fall. It is a marvel that we enjoy the peace we do from the out-side world. Showed how Enoch and others had been persecuted. In cominginto the mountains we have fulfilled the predictions of ancient prophets.Councelor W. C. Allen reported St. Joseph ward. The saints felt first lateand felt encouraged in living together in the United Order. Had enoughto do to keep out of mischief and are striving to work on a principlethat will make them self sustaining. He wanted to try to live honest andupright before the Lord. We would not get credit in the next world forour houses, cattle and lands, but for being obedient to the priesthood andthe Lord. 
 Elder Lewis Allen ^Apostle W. Woodruff^ remarked whenever you saw a man whose religionwas in his clothes you need not look for it anywhere else. 
 Apostle W. WoodruffElder Lewis Allen said it was a great satisfaction to hear the testimo-nies of the brethren.  There is a vail between us and the Lord, but thereis none between the Lord and us, and it is thus to try us and proveus.  The eyes of the Lord are over us and our works.  Spoke of Job'spatience.  We shall be held to account for the use of the gifts endowedupon us.  The Lord will sweep the wicked off from the face ofthe earth.  There is not a crime that could be named but what thisnation is guilty of.  In his boyhood he was anxious to live upon theearth when God had the priesthood upon it, and he had lived to beholdit.  We shall never be driven from these mountains, but we shallenlarge our borders and extend the Stakes of Zion.  The Lord doesnot depend upon numbers to accomplish His purposes.  We shouldbuild up Zion and the judgements will fall upon the wicked.-4-We are living in an important time.  This nation and its officerswill soon have something else to do than to chase the elders ofIsrael around.  If the Lord has any friends upon the earth it is inthese mountains. 
 Apostle W. WoodruffElder Lewis Allen then said there are certain principles which neverbecome old with us.  He a then read from the book of Mormon, Alma XIXchapter, commencing with the 5th paragraph.  There is an eternal varietyin the world.  He desired the same body in the resurrection as he now hadand he expected it, and we would all have the same bodies in the resurrec-tion and he rejoiced in it.  The company we keep here we will keep in theworld to come.  You show me what a man sows in this life and I willshow you what he will reap in the world to come.  Referred to the dark-ness that beclouded the minds of the people outside of the Latter-day SaintsIs there a happier people than the Latter-day Saints?  No.  The saints ofGod are few yet we can afford to endure persecution and those whooppose us will go to hell.  As long as the saints will let the Holy Spiritguide them, there is no danger of them falling into the dark.  Everyman who holds the priesthood will be sorry for every sin he commits.We should be kind to our wives and children and to one another.  He was thankful he was born in this generation.  He had been througha great many hard places but his life has been preserved and feltto give the glory to God.  How long he would be permitted to live hedid not know.  Let us serve the Lord and pray to God.  Every one whobears the priesthood are entittled to the spirit of revelation and we shouldlisten to the whisperings of the still small voice.  The revelations to thispeople are true.  It was pleasing to see us living in the United Order,and if all the saints would live in this manner, sinners in Zion-5-would tremble, and fear would come upon the hypocrite.  He did notfeel to forsake any of the commandments of God, for the sake of ac-commodating those who are going to hell or to a nation steeped in sinand iniquity.  Let us go upward and let our aim be for the Celes-tial Kingdom. 
 At 7 o-clock p.m. the saints met together, where elders S. G. Ladd,Isaac Turley, B.Y. Perkins H.M. Tanner and W.R. Tenney bore thier testimoniesand were followed by Elder Lewis Allen ^Apostle W. Woodruff^ who spoke in a most instructivemanner, giving his experience in the ministry and exhorted us to laborfor the redemption of the remnants of the house of Israel upon this land,saying the time has come when the Lord will pour out his Spirit upon them and they willsoon go forth in this nation and tread down the wicked as a young lion amonglambs.  He also gave instructions with regard to the missionaries sent among them, thatthey should travel and preach. 
 Elder Lewis Allen ^Apostle W. Woodruff^ said we should practice what we preach.Babylon will fall and he wanted the saints to encourage home man-ufactures.  We should lay up our wheat, and what we cannotmanufacture ourselves let us do without.  By our pursuing thiscourse we will have the blessings of the Lord upon us.  Those whoare not for us are against us, and we should be watchful and not betrayour brethren. 
 Apostle W. Woodruff said he was glad to see the improvementmade here among the Saints.  We should meet together and dedicateour fields.  The Latter-day Saints should keep the word of wisdom.The day will come when no man will be permitted to administer thesacrament or officiate in the ordinances of the Church who does notkeep the word of wisdom.  No man is fit to administer the sacrament,lay hands on the sick, or officiate in temples with tobacco in hismouth or whisky in his system, and it should not be permitted,it is not acceptable to God.  Spoke of the advantages of living togetherlike the people of the settlements on the Little Colorado, in being able togaurd against many of the evils the saints are surrounded with,and encouraged the saints throughout this territory to unite together.We should avoid going into debt and should be prompt in payingthose we hire thier wages.  There is a great field for labor among thehouse of Israel.
