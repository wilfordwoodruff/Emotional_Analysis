 and shade trees. I have not done as much as I would like  to have done but I have raised some 15 bushels of peaches  President Young has a large orchard. He has raised a good  many peaches and apples and some thousand pounds of good  grapes as good as I ever tasted; and Great Salt Lake City is  as hard a place to live in as there is in these mountains  My wood for one fire cost me some 175 dollars    These Kanyons are full of good fruit which  you can get and set out. I have several kinds of good currents  which I got from the Kaynyons which bear large and fine  fruit. These things all help to adorn the earth    Now go to and build up this place and  make a beautiful city. You have a good place around  the State House for a city and gardens and orchards. The  soil is sandy and you have plenty of manure to make it rich    The people must learn and practise  cleanliness in this life. Some people think they can live all  their days in filth and dirt never even washing their bodies, then  die and go to heaven and be clean. But if you do not  learn and practise cleanliness in this life you will have to learn  and practise it in the next before you are received into the  society of those who are clean pure and holy.    You have got to be passive in  the hands of God. As the Prophet has said if we   are not passive in the hands of God as clay is in the hands  of the potter we shall have to be cut off from the wheael and  flung into the batch and ground over again before we can  be made vessels of honour. What can we be made vessels of  honour [illegible]after we have been mared in the hands of the potter  and ground over again? Yes this will be the case with  many but it is far better to be passive in the hands of  God and be made vessels of honour the first time than

 to wait till we have to be ground over again. This is a figure  that the Prophet Jerehmiah made use of. Now President Young  is the master Potter here on earth and we should be subject to  him in all things. We should all remember that we have to   render up our Stewardship to God; therefore we should be faithful  in all things and I pray that the Spirt of God may rest upon  you that you may do right and be saved with a full salvation  and I ask it in the name of Jesus Christ: Amen.

My Appointment as Assistant Historian  of the Church.    Death of President J. M. Grant.    The business of the Legislature occupied us in  the beginning of the year    On the 5th The Judges Secretary Babbit  Marshal Heywood Captain Hardy with all their attendant  train came in this evening. There was a mystery hanging  over the company part of whom were prisoners among whom  was Babbitt. He wore chains part of the way half in  earnest and half in jest.    President Young spoke on the Sunday  upon the subject of mens judging each other. He  said he reproved men for their acts, but he was not  prepared to cast men down into hell for their imperfections  and acts until he knew the hearts of men and the principles  by which they were governed. He also said that a  person always had to experience the opposite and pass  through sorrow pain and affliction before he could  be exalted to glory; and if a man had the exact 
 a few days and then go through the Territory and strengthen their  brethren in the settlements.    John Wolley was voted to be Bishop of the 9th Ward  J. M. Grant told the Bishops and all men when they  got home to live their religion. He exhorted them in the Spirit  and power of God and President Young exhorted the people to lay  it to heart and put into practice what J. M. Grant had told them  and he blessed the congregation of Saints.    Elder Dunbar sung and the Assembly was  dismissed.    Conference was adjourned till the 6th day of April  1857.    In the evening the Seventies and Elders ^met^ in the Tabernacle.  The House was full. The first seven Presidents were present with  Joseph Young presiding.    President ^Joseph^ Young occupied the forep^art^ of the meeting  by transacting the business of the quorums. Seventy Quorums  were called upon and found to be mostly full. He then called  for a subscription from the Seventies but he got but little    Jedediah M. Grant then arose and said  "There are some things that grieve me. President Young was  asked if it would not be well to send the Presidents of the Seventies  out. He said no. They would preach the people to sleep  and then to hell. Now this shows me that there Presidents  of the Seventies are asleaep and that there is something wrong with  them. If this is the case that they would preach the people  to sleep and then to hell then this body of counsellors are guilty  of sins either of omission or commission and I would advise  Joseph Young to cut off his counsecil and drop them and  appoint men in their stead who are full of the Holy Ghost and  who will act with him and assist him."    President Grant continued in a similar ^manner^ to wake 
 glory that Jesus had he would have to die in the same way and  if a man passed through this world without passing through the  dregs of poverty he would have to pass through it before he could  be exalted to eternal riches in their fulness    There is no other way for men to get exaltation  but to follow their file leader. The Twelve have no right to  ask the Presidency why they do this or that or why they tell  the Twelve to do this or that. They only go and do as they  are told and the same principle should go through every quorum  in the Church and Kingdom of God on the earth and when this rule  is observed then the Kingdom will be ours.    He reproved the people for selling their land  warrents and said the wicked would put those very land  warrents upon our possessions and then there would be a fuss  with the Mormons and that was what the people of the world  wanted.    On the afternoon of the 9th I attended court on  the trial of Judge Drummond for murder or upon an  accusation of it. It was first brought before the Probate  Court. Then Judge Drummond got out a writ of  Habeus Corpus given by Judge Kinney. The case of  the right of writ was tried before Judge Kenney the day  before, and Mr Miner and Mr Ketting took a strong  stand against the Legislature and the laws of Utah. As  soon as the Court opened to day Judge Drummond  informed the Court that he wished to withdraw the whole  suit and Judge Kinney informed him that he would   have to be remanded back to the Probate Court. He said  he knew that but he wished to withdraw the suit without  mallace. It was withdrawn and the Court closed    In the evening of the same day the  Legislature and the citizens of Filmore met in the 
 up the Presidents and the Seventies just as he been of late preaching  repentance and reformation to all Israel.    -[He took up President Joseph Youngs council  and said    "Look at them. Now here is brother Levi Hancock  Why he will fiddle diddle di fiddle diddle do and fiddle diddle  diddle dum and tweedle diddle ta. Now he may preach  a month and there would be no more Spirit of God in it than  there would be in a cabbage leaf. Now if you would  preach the people ^to sleep and^ to hell you are guilty of some great ^henious^  sins either of omission or commission. You have either  committed adultery or some other sins and you ought to be  dropped    Here is brother Herriman. Now if you will  preach the people to sleep and to hell you are guilty of some  great sins either of commission or omission ahave committed  adultery or some great sins and you ought to be dropped  Brother Herriman might preach a month; then you might  put it all into the eye of a cambric needle and there would be  as much room in it as there would be for a bull frog in the  Atlantic Ocean    Albert P. Rockwood if you would preach the  people to sleep and to hell, you are asleep dead and guilty  of committing adultery or some great sins. There is no  sap in you. You are as dry as an old musk rat skin  and you ought to be dropped    And Zerah Pulsipher if he would preach  the people to sleep and to hell you are guilty of some abominable  sins of commission or ommission of committing adultery or  some great sins and ought to be dropped    And I would say the same of  Benjamen Clapp and Horace S Eldridge according to 
 School House to take into consideration the propriety of establishing  a weekly or daily line of stages and mail from the Missouri  River.    Secretary Almon W. Babbit spoke first. He  was followed by Judge Stiles Potter Rockwell Orson Pratt  Enoch Reese John S. Fulmer and then Governor Young  closed. They brought to light many interesting things. I  reported all their speeches and had them in reserve. The  meeting was adjourned to the Tabernacle in Great Salt Lake  City Saterday the 26th of Jan. 1856    On Sunday the 13th President Young  delivered one of his greatest Sermons. I was not at the  meeting but collected the following synopsis mostly from  Thomas Bullock's report.    Sermon  Delivered  By President Brigham Young  At Filmore  Jan 13th 1856    By our acts we have said to the world we  are Christ's and we have exhibited it more than any others  of the Christian world. Every thread and tie that  binds man to man has been broken assunder, in consequence  of receiving the fulness of the Gospel of Christ. Men  have left their wives; wives their husbands; children their  parents and parents their children; brothers their sisters, and  sisters their brothers in order to be gathered with the Saints  of God that they might partake of salvation. [illegible]^This people have  proven to the world by their acts that they have a knowledge of the way of life and salvation^    This people have proven to all men  that they can sacrifice every endearment in this life for 
 the President's words they are alsleep and ought to be dropped    I think that Brother Joseph ought to cut them off  and prune the trees around him.    How can the body be kept alive and healthy  when the head is asleep and dead? It has been with great  reluctance that I have voted for the Presidents of the Seventies  for a long time and I will say to those Seventies if your presidents  have gone to sleep dont you go to sleep but keep awake. If  your Presidency have committed adultery and done wrong  and committed great sins that will damn them dont you  do it but wake up    Is there any man ^who is^ in that council who has  been ordained a counsellor to Joseph Young? If so I do not  know it; but each man was ordained a President and is under  as much obligation as Joseph Young is to magnify his calling  and do his duty. But they never think of such a thing of  taking any burden upon their shoulders, but leave it all  for Joseph Young to do; and he has to drag them along    When I vote for Rockwood Pulsipher Herriman  and Levi Hancock I do it very reluctantly and I have done  so for years.    Now I want to have you to wake up and do  your duty.]-    On the 9th Elder Franklin D. Richards and his  company called upon President Young to settle all their matters as  agents afar the Church abroad.    Some remarks were made last Sunday night  relative to the children of Joseph Smith. President Young  said I have no rega fears with regard to the family of Joseph  God will take care of them and all will be right    We had just pastsed through another General  Conference and such an one I never saw before. The Spirit 
 eternity life and salvation and we prove that we bear this principle  through every difficulty which we are called to pass through    It is our duty to make every sacrifice that is  required of us so that our Father in heaven, the holy angels and  all just men who sit enthroned in glory and power and dominion  may look upon us in the character; that is that they may see in their  kingdoms that we are willing to make every sacrifice (if I may  call it a sacrifice) and not looking to man in order that we may  secure a seat with them in eternal light and glory. But  notwithstanding all the light and knowledge we have of life and  salvation do you not see how easy it is for us to turn away  to the right and to the left and say and do many things which  we afterwards regret and wish we had not done. Is it not   the scase with us all more or less? It is    I see a thousand weaknesses in myself that  I now regret and it is so with all those who have the light  of the Spirit of God. They can see their weaknesses and  regret them and they will try to overcome them. I cannot  only see these things in myself but I can see them in my brethren  for when I learn myself and Brigham I learn my brethren  By this rule I know all of you    We give way to temptation and angry  feelings against our brother and whant to be revenged on him  I ask is this a righteous feeling? No it is not and yet  we live day by day and week after week and year after  year in this way    The people will be guilty of a little lying  a little swearing a little deceiving and a little stealing. Do  you think you can be forgiven of all your sins and be forgiven  in a moment? No you cannot every Latter-day Saint  knows better. This would be sectarianism. The  religion of the world is that a man may commit murder 
 of God is like a flame among the leaders of this people and  they were throwing the arrows of the Almighty. Jedediah M.  Grant was as a sharp two-edged sword and he was calling  upon the people to wake up and repent of their sins. The Elders also  who had returned from their missions to Europe were full of the  Holy Ghost and the accounts which they gave of their missions  and the dealings of God with them had been very interesting    I spent the 11th in the Historian's  Office making a ^commencement^ upon the History of Brigham Young  Presidents Brigham Young and Heber C Kimball and Joseph and  John Young came into the Office and heard read what was written  and corrected what was wrong    The Texan Company arrived in the City  this day at 4 o'clock P.M.    In the prayer ^circle^ on Sunday Elder Leonard  Wilford Hardy was called forward and Presidents Brigham Young  Heber C Kimball and Jedediah and M ^M^ Granat and Franklin D  Richards and Wilford Woodruff laid hands upon his head  and ordained him to the office of an High Priest and a Bishop  and also as the First Counsellor to Bishop Edward Hunter  The following is a synopsis of    The Ordination and Blessing of Leonard Wilford Hardy  As Bishop and First Counsellor to Bishop Edward Hunter  Given Sunday the 12th of October 1856. President Young being mouth    Brother Leonard Wilford Hardy, In the name  of Jesus Christ and by virtue of the Holy Priesthood we lay  our hands onupon your head and ordain you to be a High  Priest and a Bishop in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day  Saints. And we also ordain you to be the First Counsellor  to Bishop Edward Hunter who is the Chief Bishop in the 
 and when on the gallows he can repent and be forgiven and go  right straight into Abraham's bosom. But this is false doctrine  It is not true.    Some may say I cannot overcome my passions  when I am tempted and tried: I cannot help giving way to my  feelings; I must give vent to them and scold and sometimes  sware and I cannot help it. But I can tell you, you can  help it. You have got to help it some time or other or you  cannot be saved. You have got to begin to learn to  learn to overcome. You should begin to improve day  by day; shun the errors as you see them and improve  upon them. Be a better man and woman to-morrow  than you are to day. Continue to improve. There  is not a man or woman here but what can do better than  they do.    But says one "Brother Brigham says hard  words. So I do use harsh words. I am death and  hell on the wicked; but you never hear me speak evil of  by brethren. But I will reprove wickedness among the  human family    As your leader I will say let us try to  improve our lives. Let us overcome every temper and  evil passion that arises within you. You can shut your  mouth and keep your tongue still and quiet; and the next  time you are tempted you can overcome it easier. Keep  silence and it will give you a great victory    Mothers when you are cross and  attempt to correct your children, conquer yourselves first.  Fathers when you feel any of the evil passions of your nature  arise then you need the grace of God to help bring yourselves  into subjection that you may go in the Spirit of meekness  until you get the victory over your feelings 
 Church and we seal upon your head all the power and authority of this  priesthood and Bishoprick and we seal upon you the Spirit of counsel  and revelation that you may counsel the people to pay their tithing and  we bless you with the gift of descernment that you may have power  to magnify your calling and you shall have the Spirit of prophecy and  revelation visions and dreams and the administersihng of angels and  you shall be filled with wisdom and shall assist in building up the  Kingdom of God on the earth, and shall be an active assistant  unto Bishop Hunter in gathering the tithing of the people that  the temples of our God may be built and his works carried on. Let  your heart be comforted you shall be blessed with every good thing  your heart shall desire and your words shall be like a two edged  sword among the people and we seal you up unto Eternal Life and  no man shall take your crown. We seal all these blessings  upon your head in the name of Jesus Christ: Amen.    Jesse C. Little was then ordained unto the office  of Bishop and the Second Counsellor to Bishop Hunter. The  following is a synopsis of the    Ordination and Blessing of Jesse C. Little as Bishop  and Second Counsellor of Edward Hunter Chief Bishop.  Given Sunday October the 12th 1856. President Young being mouth.    "Brother Jesse C Little; In the name of Jesus Christ we  lay our hands upon your head and we ordain you to be a Bishop  and the Second Counsellor unto Bishop Edward Hunter in the Church  of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and we seal upon your head  all the blessings appertaining to the Bishoprick and we pray God  to let the Holy Ghost rest upon you and we say it shall rest upon  you at this time and you shall live long upon the earth and stand  by thy brethren until death even thy brethren whose hands are  upon thy head and be with them both in time and eternity 
 We are liable to get out of the way. We should not  do wrong knowingly for if we say or do things which are wrong we  are under obligation to confess our faults. It would be a hard  matter for me to confess that I had done a wrong knowingly    You should be goverened by righteousness.  Let every Elder in Israel look upon his brethren and sisters like  little children. When a person does wrong in his foolish weakness  look upon it as such.    We see the children of men laboring hard to obtain  wealth. They labor night and day to obtain this object. But wealth  will not give you wisdom; but if you will shun evil and extend the  hand of charity to every living being and do good to all as far as  you have an opportunity. This will grow in you and you will  increase in wisdom and knowledge    We should live so as to enjoy the Spirit of  revelation that we may know the will of God concerning us in  all things. You should not live for yourselves alone for  if your affections are not placed on the Lord Jesus Christ and you  do not possess charity you will miss the gate and not enter into  the glory of God yourselves; for you will not receive the Spirit  of the Gospel.    You ^hearts^ should be empty^ied^ of everything that ^but^ the  Spirit of the Gospel that you may be filled with the spirit  of revelation that you may know the voice of the Good Shepherd;  ^for if this people were to lose the Spirit of revelation and turn from righteousness they would be liable to be  led down to hell but while the people keep the spirit of God and of revelation with them they would know the  voice of the Good Shepherd.^    If I was to get out of the way would not all  who had the Spirit of God see it as they did Sidney and Strang  and William Smith? ^Yes they would^ When Sidney Rigdon claimed to be  the Shepherd and leader of this people the people knew not his  voice; but when the true Shepherd spoke they knew his  voice and they followed him    It is the duty of this people and their  privilege to live in such a manner that they cannot be deceived 
 You shall have visions dreams and the spirit of prophecy; and  thou shalt have the gift of discernment to know the hearts of the  children of men: And we seal these blessings upon your head  and seal you up unto Eternal Life in the name of Jesus Christ:  Amen.    The Gospel in the English Language the Most Effective    At the 14 Ward meeting Elder Franklin D. Richards testified that  he had found the people more ready to carry out the principles  of this Kingdom who had been taught it in the English language  than those who only understood the Welsh and other languages  It had seemed like speaking through the quill to the Welsh  Churches all the time.    Presidents Brigham Young ^Heber C Kimball  J. M. Grant on the 14th^ went out to meet the emigration but they had  to return to the city on the 15th in consequence of President Young  being very sick    Next day in company with Heber C. Kimball  I visited President Young. We found him feeble but  much recovered. The sickness had mostly left him as soon  as he had returned over the CBig Mountain towards the city  There had seemed something very mysterious about his sickness  He was taken very severely on the evening of the 14th with  pain in the kidneys and bowels and he nearly fainted away  Presidents Kimball and Grant administered unto him and prayed  for him and he began to recover. The Brethren felt that  the valley in which they were was ful^l^ of devils. They had  to go on to the mountain before they could get the spirit of  prayer. They felt that there was a legion of devils congregated  around them in the valley where the^y^ were and trying to destroy  them. They also felt that there was evil intended against  them on the road and that they should leave that valley and 
 by any deceiver.    It is your duty to live your religion. No man can  magnify the Priesthood and his calling unless he lives his religion and unless  he is filled with the Spirit of revelation of the holy Ghost and of the  Holy Priesthood: then he can magnify his calling and do his duty  to his neighbor and all men; then there would be an end to  Bishop's trials and High Council trials    Parents are under the greatest obligations to  live their religion. So also are the young men and women  that when they get married their children may be begotten in holiness  born in holiness and brought forth into the world in righteousness  and then you cannot make anything but Saints of them    Begin your work right; carry it on  right; bring up your children right: then when they are  old they will not depart from it    This is the commandment which God  made with Abraham that to his seed there should be no  end and this promise was made to him when he was childless   He received this covenant from the Lord and desired to see  it fulfilled upon the earth [##Genesis 15:4-5##]    Abraham was driven from his father's  house after he had received the Priesthood. [##Genesis 12:1##] ^The Lord bestowed his Priesthood upon him by a man whose name was Melchesideck. [##Doctrine and Covenants 84:14##] When Abraham  received the Priesthood^ The people were  so wicked that no man would receive him; but the Lord  promised him a Seed through whom the Holy Priesthood should  be perpetuated forever and that to the increase of his seed  there should be no end. The Lord promised to Abraham  this great blessing. A man can have no greater blessing  than was promised to him; that he should have children  who should have the Priesthood. I would not ask for  any greater blessing than this for myself    The Lord promised Abraham that  the various ordinances of his kingdom should be administered 
 return home. So they hitched up their horses in the morning and started  for home and the nearer they drew to the city the better they felt.    Ordination of Frederick Kesler to the Bishoprick.  Sunday Oct. the 19th 1856    President Young at the close of prayers called upon Bishop Hunter  and his council to ordain Frederick Kesler to be a Bishop in the  Sixteenth Ward. They laid hands upon him and the following  is a synopsis of his ordination:    Brother Frederick Kesler, In the name of Jesus  Christ we lay our hands upon your head and we ordain you a  High Priest and a Bishop in the Church of Jesus Christ of  Latter-day Saints and we seal upon your head all the blessings  which have been sealed upon you by any of the Servants of God  in days which are past and gone and we seal upon you all the  power blessing and keys of the High Priesthood and Bishoprick  and you shall have power to sustain and comfort the drooping  spirits of the people and we seal upon you all blessings which  are needful to sustain you in your calling and every blessings  which your heart can desire in righteousness before ^the^ Godlord. We  seal these blessings upon your ^head^ in the name of Jesus Christ:  Amen.    On the 23rd when I called upon President Young  I found him in company with Bishop Taylor John Sharp  and others making a contract about digging the tunnel to take  out Weber River into Davis County. The following conversation  took place:    President Young said, he would not undertake this  job unless the Bishops would bind themselves to pay as fast  as we get the lumber for them; and I want $1000 pay  kept in advance and the people must back this matter  up. Brother Taylor said they would do it. The 
 people are expecting to back it up. This tunnel will be one  mile and a quarter long    President Young asked Brother Taylor ofif  he wanted us to commence this job and go on with it?    Brother Taylor said I do    President Young said to John Sharp are you  prepared to take hold and boss this job, as I cannot attend  to it.    Brother Sharp said he would    "Now Brother Taylor you go and get your hands and  go to that dam and build that and do it well. Do not  trust any man to boss that job who is not well acquainted with  the buisness. Now I want to give you some instruction  about this job. Get you a gang of hands and say to them  Now I will give you so much interest for doing so much on  this land. ^canal^ Let the Bishops take their men and go with  them and have the Canal staked off and say to the companies  that those who get their job done first they shall have a  silver medal.    Brother Taylor asked, "Shall we enlarge Kay's  Settlement" and was answered "No; until the people the  people build up and improve what they have got    "What shall those do who are there and have   no place to build upon"    "Let the people who have more land than theiry  can improve to a good advantage devide with them. Now  you will want some shanties but I don't want anything built  but dug outs. Dig your holes in the bank and cover over  with slabs as they will be temporary buildings"    Wm. Eddington Hugh Findley and  Wm G. Mills called upon President Young to consult his  feelings upon the continuation of the entertainments of the 
 Literary and Musical Society. They came as a committee from  that society    President Young said, "I do not like some things that  have been there. Most of the sisters and brethren have written  very good essays; but some have been vulgar. But I have no  objection to their being continued if they can be conducted in righteousness  I would like you to get a globe revolving there and give lectures  upon gelography history and science. They all belong to our religion  and there are but few who can retain in their memory the geography  of the world. So lectures would be interesting to many upon  this subject. I do not want to hear baldadash; but I want  to hear that which is right and tends to good    A man arrived from Laramie from whom we  learned that A. O. Smoot was at Green River and that the last  company whom the Indians killed the same number as the soldiers  had killed of the Indians they in turn killed of the whites and  then they were satisfied and gave themselves up and they also surrendered  Mrs Margetts whom they had taken prisioner.    Snow on the Big Mountain was eight inches  deep.    Elder Dan Jones arrived on the 24th quite unwell and on Sunday  the 26th he was called up to speak but could only do so for a short  time. He looked nearly worn out    At the close of President Kimball's remarks which  followed he called upon all the horse teams in the city and county  to go into the Mountains and pick up the companies who were  coming with hand-carts and bring them into the city. One hundred  and fifteen were raised in a few minutes and all were prepared to  start in the morning. They were to take grain to feed them  with. President Young was unwell and not at the Tabernacle.    At the prayer circle the subject came up concerning the  emigration starting so late that it had cost the Territory more 
 than it would to have bought oxen and brought them through for we  have had to send some two hundred and fifty teams out to meet  them emigration and to send some twenty tons of flour and many  thousands of dollars of shoes and clothing.    President Young asked why they were so late  Brother Franklin Richards said that Elder Taylor wanted to control  the emigration and means and would not take hold and assist in  the work without    President Young said that Brother Taylor was a good  man in many respects but he was not fit to handle means any  more than a child. "I am going to inform all the churches  people and agents next season who do not take my counsel  that they shall be suspended from the Church    Elder Taylor said that the Handcart companies  could not be forwarded short of £12 (pounds) which would   not do at all.    President Young observed to Franklin Richards  "You had your possitive instructions what to do but  John Taylor but stood in your way and you did not do  as you were told and the people were sent to^o^ ^so^ late that it  cost us many thousand dollars to get them in. Now what  do you think of such things    Elder Franklin Richards said the only  excuse I have to offer is that Orson Spencer was dead  and John Taylor took charge of all things in the States and   informed me that he had instructions from President Young to  attend to it which it appears was not correct. Elder Taylor  wanted to handle the money himself which was wrong.    I met with President Grant and all the  Missionaries at the house of Franklin D. Richards    President Grant said Elders Woodruff  and Franklin D Richards would preside over the missionaries 
 The following is a synopsis of the directions of President Grant  to the Missionaries    "I want you to go through the Territory and do what  God wants you to do. Go prepared for battle. When it is necessary  jerk men up by their mains ^names^. Wake up the Bishops and all presiding  officers and then the people.    "Now we want to know what all men are doing throughout  this Territory. The people are dirty: we want them to reform in this  thing. Many do not treat their children right but use them roughly  Now if a man has the Spirit of God he will use his children well and  treat them kindly. I can tell you that children are very sensative  and the treatment which they meet has a great effect upon them    We want to see to that the people are employed  The reason why we prosper in this city more than in any other is that  we labour.    I went to ^Taylorsville^ with Joseph Young and the people  was so dead and bad that brother Joseph wanted to go home  and not stop. I told him I would not go until I converted  that people and I stayed until I ^had done it and they had^ got the Spirit of God. Then  I conqurerd the people. So at the city Bountiful. I preached  there until the Spirit stoped there for days but at first the  Bishop was asleaep    When you go to a place treat the people right  Get the Spirit of God and then you will know what is going on  When you go to a place preach to the people. Dont get into  Noah's ark nor into the city of Jerusalem but just tell that  people what you want them to do.    More was also said and then F. D. Richards spoke  ^and^ Daniel Spencer James Ferguson Dan Jones Edmund Ellsworth  brother Smith John Van Cott and George D Grant all spoke  in turn    President Grant wished the missionaries to meet on 
 the following Friday night    Robert Scholes started on the morning of the 28th  with my horses and waggon to go into the Mountains to assist the Saints    I met President Grant on the 31st and he said   there had come an express from the First Handcart company and that  they brought bad news. They were caught in a snow storm and  dying very fast. The people became chilled. They would draw  all day and die at night and those who dug the graves for the brethren  would themselves die the same day.    This I learned from the messengers themselves  They said the night before they met the company there were  five deaths. There had been some 25 deaths twenty of whom  were men    They had not heard from the 2nd Hand cart company  Joseph Young and Cyrus H. Wheelock went ahead with the  news that help was coming and George D. Grant followed with  ten of the best teams.    There had been about fifty five deaths in  the first company in consequence of cold. The captain of  the company had dealt out all the provisions to the people the  night before any help came and they did not know that  any help was coming. They dealt out 11 oz. to a man  9 to a woman and 6 to a child. There was but little snow  on the road till they got to the Rocky Ridge    At the Prayer Circle on Sunday   November the 2nd President Young wished me to write  out a list of the "Commandments" which he wished to make  use of in the Reformation    Brigham H. Young arrived on the   3rd. He had been with A. O. Smoot to St. Louis  Keokuk and Nauvoo. Nauvoo looked desolate  weeds growing up in the streets. He went to Emma 
 Smith's mansion but could ^not^ see any of the family. He said that  Emma had instilled into the minds of her children that it was President  Young who had caused the death of Joseph and Hyrum Smith. -[An  idea more false never entered the human soul). President Brigham  Young said that he thought Joseph would have as hard work to dig  her out of hell in the next world as he did in this.    The Gospel Scales of the Reformation    On the 4th the Presidency the Twelve the Seventies the High  Priests and the Bishops with their councils all met at the Social   Hall and President Young weighed the whole of them in the  scales of the celestial law of God and there were but very few  that weighed clear in every point. President Young taught  the people good doctrine and in a fatherly spirit.    The Presidency and Twelve and others met in council  at the Historian's Office on the 8th and the subject came up of  reading the sermon of President Young concerning the late emigration  and what cause^d^ so much suffering. It was concluded to  strike out the reflections cast upon F. D Richards, and ^but^ more upon  John Taylor for hindering the brethren from doing business for  several weeks.    President Young said Bishoph Hunter when the  Handcart companies come in I want to have the Bishops take the  people to some empty houses and appoint an overseer over them  so that they may not eat themselves to death for they would killl  themselves with eating if they had an opportunity.    On the 10th Elder A. O. Smoot brought in  the Church train goods &c and brother Willie the Handcart  company. There had been 60 deaths in that company  They were nearly chilled to death by the snows and cold  in the mountains 
 Promise of the Remission of the Sins of the People  Given by President Young November the 10th 1856    I attended meeting of the Presidents of the Seventies in the  Seventies Hall    While I was speaking President Young came in when  I closed and was followede by Herriman Hancock and Pulsifepher  and then President Young    The President promised the people in the name  of Jesus Christ that if they would repent and turn from their sins  from that hour all their sins should be forgiven them and not  remembered against them any more for ever either on earth or  in heaven.    ^On the 11th^ An Express came in from the teams saying that  the teams had gone to the Sweet Water and hearing nothing  from the companies they turned back. President Young  immediately took measures to raise an Express to go directly  and turn the teamsters back again to continue back until  they met the company and several horsemen were to go with   them    I heard early on the morning of the 13th that an  Express had come in from the Handcart company and I went  to the President's and met with all the Presidency. The following  is a synopsis of what I learned    Brother Joseph A. Young and George D. Grant  parted. They agreed that they should not go any farther  than the Devil's Gate until George came up. He did not  find the company so Joseph A. then went on to the Platte  and found them at the Upper cCrossing of the Platte. They   were in camp and had been nine days waiting for the  snow to go off. Soon brother George D. Grant  arrived and prepared the camp for moving. He asked 
 Joseph what would his father do now if he was here^?^ Joseph A. Young said   "If my father was here he would take all the books and heavy materials and  cache them in order to save the lives of the people." So they agreed to do  it; and they cached all their articles at Devils Gate and took up the  weak and the feeble and started towards home    They then sent an express back to have the teams  come on to them that was on the road. But brother Vancott and  Claudius Spencer had got to the Sweet Water and not hearing anything  from the Handcart companies they turned back with their teams  and nearly all the companies followed them. This news arrived  in the city several days since and an express was sent back to  turn them again to meet the handcart companies    All the companies out of the emigration were  together when the brethren found them. There were two ox  trains and the handcart train. Many of the old oxen had  died but the young oxen many of them were fat and fine    Brother Tenant who had bought President  Young's place was dead. He died near Scott's Bluffs. The  people were suffering with cold and hunger some    David Kimball and others went ahead  picked out camp grounds made up fires shovelled off the snow  and when the camp came up they would take the old men  women and children who could not walk and carry them to the  fires and help them get supper and then they would dance  around the fires and sing and shout to keep up the spirits of the  people; and while journing during the day they would wade over  all the streams and drag the handcarts over and carry all the  lame women men and children over    When William Kimball met with brother  Vancott he took one pair of his mules and put on to his own  waggon and told him to turn round with himthe others and  follow him to the East until they met with the companies. 
 They had returned from the Sweet Water as far as to Weber when  William Kimball turned them back again. Brothers ^Presidents^ Young and  Kimball felt severe with Brother Vancott and Claudius Spencer for  returning, and the President said that if they had the Spirit of God with  them they would not have done it.    Elder George D. Grant wrote a good letter to  President Young giving a description of the company and their situation  He says^id^ that not more than one third of the handcart company was  able to walk and many were barefoot and freezing their toes. When  the brethren found them they were all together and camped in about  a foot of snow where they had been nine days waiting for the  snow to go off and to recruit the cattle.    Among other things which came up at this time  was the subject of miracles. President Young said I have had  a $5 gold piece put into my pocket now two days in succession  I do not know from what source it came from. Brother Kimball  said it was an angel.    Brother Young then related a circumstance that  when he and brother Kimball was travelling East together they  had thirteen dollars and fifty cents only and they travelled until  they had paid $87 out of it and had sixpence left and they  received no addition from any known hand. Brother Kimball said  that an angel had put it into our trunk.    On the 22nd Franklin D Richards and myself  laid hands upon J. M. Grant who was very sick. This was  the beginning of his sickness which shortly ended in his death    On Sunday the 23rd Elder Farnham  spoke of his mission to South Australia and in the afternoon  Robert Skelton gave an account of his mission in India  Calcutta Rangoon &c    There was a call this day made at noon for  more men and animals to go into the Mountains and about 
 one hundred men arose in the congregation to go with teams. President  Young said that if they had to send many more into the mountains  he thought it best to move the city into the mountains and spend the   winter.    I called upon President J. M. Grant and found him  very ill on the 26 and 27th and thus he continued to be. On the  29th he had the worse night up to that time. The devil worked  hard all night to kill his body. The brethren laid hands  upon him many times and rebuked the powers of darkness  The devil would lay upon him a strong hand from his feet to  his head all through his slimbs and stomach and a rib at a  time and it seemed as though he would crush his body  Brother Grant though very weak would rebuke him an hour  at a time from limb to limb and rib to rib. It was a  perfect warefare all night. He was easier in the morning    We heard on this day news from the hand-cart  company. They were to camp that night ^at Killion's^ at the  foot of the Little Mountain. Brother Decker the night before  came in with the express. He said that the ox trains  could not even get to Bridger and that they had sent in for  forty tons of flour. The cattle and people were dying    Arrival of the Handcart ^Company^    Sunday November the 30th ^1856^    At the Tabernacle President Young made remarks concerning  the hand-cart company, who was then entering the city. He wished  the inhabitants to take the people into their houses and nurse them  up and he said that he would take all that was left.    When the meeting was over we held a short  sitting in the Legislature and then went into the street and 
 saw the poor Saints who had just arrived. There were about  one hundred waggons containing the company. Many were  cripples and had their hands and feet frozen off nearly off  They were immediately distributed through the city    Death Of President Jedediah M. Grant.    Dec. the 1st 1856    I called upon President Young at his office. He had  been down to lay hedands upon President J. M. Grant who  lay very low. His lungs appeared to fill and he had  no power to raise anything from his lungs. It appeared  that he could not live but a short time unless there was  a change soon for the better. He said he felt as  though he wanted an apple some grapes or wine  or something upon his stomach. President Young  sent him down some and they roasted an apple an  he eat it about 12 o'clock and seemed to relish it well  He also drank some buttermilk which he relished  but it was a death appetite    The missionaries met at the Historian's office  and soon President Young came in and opened the meeting  with prayer. F. D. Richards made a short report  or address and was followed by Wilford Woodruff who  expressed his feelings in great plainness concerning the  people taking off from the President a part of the burden  which was resting upon him for he was wearing out  Then all the missionaries who were sent to the different  Wards were called upon to report. All made their  reports and spoke encourageingly of the reformation.  F. D. Richards and myself then started down to see 
 President Grant.    On our way down we met Dr Sprague who informed  me that President Jedediah Morgan Grant was dead. He died  December the 1st 1856 20 minutes past 10 oclock at night aged 40 years  9 months and 7 days.    Dr Sprague informed me that he had just breathed  his last. We immediately went into the house and found his  wives and children weeping bitterly. Jesse C. Little Leonard W.  Hardy Daniel H. Wells George Davisson Grant and Doctors Sprague  Dunyon and Israel Ivins were standing around his body. As  I gazed upon his tabernacle of clay without his spirit I felt to  exclaim a mighty man in Zion is laid low—a valient man  in Israel has fallen and a great champion of the Kingdom of God  is taken from ^us^ our midst.    We felt his loss deeply. For two months it  seemed as though he had been hurried to close up his work. He  had been preaching for several months calling upon the people  to repent. His voice has been like the trumph of the  angel of God. He had been laboring night and day  until he was laid prostrate with sickness. He had shot  the arrows of the Almighty with great power among the people  He called at the Historians Office on the 19th of November which  was the last day he was out. He was confined to his house  ten days before his death. He had a great vision while  he was sick which he told the brethren. He preached nearly  all the time and related all that he saw in the spirit world.    Soon after I entered the house on the night of his  death his wife Rosetta was seized with great trembling and  nervous excitement and it seemed as though her frame would shake  to pieces. We laid hands upon her and rebuked the devil  which seemed to seize her tabernacle and she became  more calm. I assisted Dr Dunyon in laying out 
 the body of brother Grant. I spent the night with his  remains    I left brother Grant's family a short time in  the morning called upon Capt. Hooper found him quite sick and  administered to him. Then I went to my house got a piece of  fine linen and Mrs. Woodruff accompanied me to brother Grant's. I  gave them the linen to make a garment and robes to lay out the  body in. I went to President Young's to get Zina Young  to go down and help make the robes. President Young came  in and spoke of brother Grant's death. He said we had done  all we could to save his life but the powers the other side of the  veil were stronger than we were and he was wanted there    Sister Zina Young walked with me to  President Grant's and spent the day with the sisters in making   the robes. I felt sick and went home and went to bed and  was sick throughout the day    Burial of President Jedediah Morgan Grant  Dec. the 3rd 1856.    I spent most of this day in writing the obituary of J. M. Grant    The doors of our deceased brother's house was  thrown open for the people to visit the corps and preparations  ^were made^ for his funeral. Many thousands went through the house   to visit the body. At half past nine the military began  to form in open line from the residence to the Tabernacle and three  bands of music were in attendance. The Lieutenant General and  staff General Grant^'s and staff^ and all the lancers were in attendance and  a company of York masons formed in the procession. The  corps was removed to the Tabernacle and the place filled up and  many could not get in. But it took so long to get through  with the ceremonies of the morning that it was ten minutes 
 wisdom to send men toas Teachers to the Gentile stores to preach  the Gospel to them. I considered they were wicked and  corrupt and it was like casting pearls before swine. When   I closed F. D. Richards backed me up and bore testimony  that what I said was true    Then the Bishop arose and opposed me  very strongly and said that he presided over the Fourteenth Ward  and he had sent the Teachers to preach to the Gentiles and he  wished them to go and do it.    I saw that the Devil had ensnared him.  When he sat down the Teacher arose and said What shall I  do. Brother Woodruff says do not go to the Gentiles and Bishop  Hogland says go. I arose and said obey your Bishop  for he says he will take the responsibility upon himself in  sending Teachers to the Gentile stores. Many of the  Priesthood were fired up upon the subject but the meeting  closed and we went home    Brother Richards and myself went up  to President Young's and we related what had taken place with  ourselves and Bishop Hogland; and President Young was   astonished at the position which the Bishop had taken. He  said the Devil was leading him into difficulty and he could  not extricate himself without help. He immediately  sent for Bishop Hogland who came up and the subject was  talked over and President Young showed his error and  he saw and confessed it. President Young told him  that the Twelve held the keys of the Kingdom of God in all  the world where the Presidency are not and that no Bishop  presided over any one of the Twelve in any place. The  Bishop made his confession and went home.    I have related this as an example  of a principle that none might err and not as reflection 
 upon Bishop Hogland who was one of the best of men and the best of  Bishops    On the Sunday ^evening^ at the Fourtheenth Ward I was requested to speak  I arose upon my feet though heavily oppressed in Spirit but the  Spirit of God came upon me and was like fire shut up in my bones  and I spake to the people about 3/4 of an hour and I scarcely knew  whether I was in the body or out of the body neither could I afterwards  remember much what I said and the house was as still as the house  of death.    On the evening of the following day I attended the meeting  of the missionaries and Bishops. Presidents Young and Kimball  were present also Wilford Woodruff and Franklin D. Richards of the  Twelve.    Wilford Woodruff arose and called the names of the Bishops  and missionaries most of whom answered to their names. F. D.  Richards then opened by prayer and singing and then Wilford Woodruff  arose and addressed the meeting. After his address President  Young sung, "O happy souls who pray'' and then addressed the  meeting of which the following is    A Synopsis  Of the Remarks of President Young to the Missionaries  Dec. the 8th 1856.    Brother Woodruff has given us a good testimony—a living testimony  in the Spirit and power of the Holy Ghost. Now any of  the rest of you who have the Holy Ghost arise and speak to us  those things which will edify    -[ B. L. Clapp and E. D. Wooley then spoke for a few  moments and then President Young continued]-    I don't expect to speak much to night. I have  learned to govern myself in talking as well as in other things.  It may be asked if this a new work. It is not a new work 
 but our reformation is the work we begun in when we embraced  the Gospel. I have pointed out the errors of the people all the  time and shown the people their faults and told them what to do  But here is the difficulty: As soon as the Elders come home from  their missions in a few days they lay down their armour while they should  keep it on all the time and keep it bright but their minds are engrossed  with the things of the world and they lie down and go to sleep. Their   only ambition is to know how they can get this house built or to get  a farm horses cattle &c. Their whole soul is in the work of the  world and not the building of the Kingdom of God. But any  man who gets property upon this principle it will corode him. He  has not wisdom to use it    I have toeld the people a hundred times they  do not know how to get rich. The way for the people to get  rich is to do the will of God and they must be governed by the  revelations and Spirit of God.    Brother Woodruff has told us here to night  how it is. When I look upon the conduct of the people before  the reformation commenced as I was teaching them the way of  salvation daily and they would not give heed. It pained my   heart and I felt as if I should die; but when brother Jedediah M  Grant steped forward and took the burden off from me I was  relieved but it has cost him his life. Had he not have taken  that burden upon him he would have lived a few years longer in  our midst.    I have felt that unless the people would awake and live  their religion I must go down to the grave. But the burden of  this people was taken from me and it rested on him and it has  not yet returned to me although he is dead. Should it return  to me as it has been I shall soon follow him to the grave for I  could not live long with that weight upon me    When you first received the Gospel was not 
 your hearts filled with love? aAnd did you not put on the Gospel armour and  would it not have continued with you all the time if you had lived your  religion all the time but you have had hard feelings in your hearts  and against your neighbor; but if the Spirit of God continued with  you it would have overcome; it would have overcome those evil feelings  And what if we were all to put our armour off and partake of the spirit of   anger and hatred? God would spew us out of his mouth and we should  go down to hell together and he would raise up another people to do his  will.    After all the stupor that has rested upon this people they have been  gaping for more revelation. I do not mean one man but I mean  the whole people, while they have already a great deal more than they  are worthy of and if this people do not wake up and live their religion  the Lord will take away the sources of revelation which they now  have from the people. It is not a few men who have got to live  their religion but it is the whole community. If we as a people  will return unto the Lord I know he will receive us with open arms    I am glad that this Winter has commenced without  fidling and dancing. But would there be any harm in going  into the hall and having a dance if we felt right and kept the Spirit  of God with us? No there would not. But as soon as we  should opon this door how many would keep the amour on and  live their religion and keep the Spirit of God. Not many.  Some would but many would say come let us go and take a drink  and begin to get the liquor in them and they would say, "Come  brother Brigham I am ready for anything; stand out of the way  here: Hurrah for hell; sware a little damn a little; steal a little  gamble a little and raise the devil    But we will stop fidling and dancing until  the brethren get power to overcome these things and keep them under  their feet. I do not intend to start dancing again until the  people will learn to do right and live their religion. I have to war 
 with the weaknesses of man. I am encompassed with it. I know  what it is to fight it all the time. If you are going to continue a reformation  make up your minds to live your religion. If the people will do this  it will be as brother Woodruff says: the darkness will pass away and  I can live long among this people and so can brother Kimball and other  men. But if this people will go on lying stealing swearing and  whoring I dont want to live but I want to leave the people and go  to God and let the wicked go to hell. I hope that God will send  the wicked who will not repent so down to hell quickly to be burned  up so that they may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus    When I first came into this Church I was  an enthusiast ^and^ though^t^ I would never ^keep an account—never^ put pen to paper and never  say this or that is mine, but it is the Lords. We never can be of  one heart and ^one^ mind until we can say that all that we have is the  Lord's and that we are only his servants and stewards to control it  according to his will.    When the Lord gives me property he gives me wisdom  to use it. We have individual rights and shall have to all eternity  What are those rights. If I have any property horses cattle waggons  or anything else my neighbor has no right to steal it from me  and if the people have the Spirit of the Lord they will know that  it is not right to take anything which belongs to another without  liberty but let it remain where it is.    We are accountable for our time to the  Lord. Now if you have a months leasure time and you gamble  that away and do not bring to pass any good you may just as  well throw away $20, and you are accountable for this waste  of time    I am often astonished at the follies of this people. Many  women are asking their husbands for some new thing. They  want a dozen new dresses and many unnecessary things  But what does a person want of a dozen new dresses. If this 
 people would ask for those things which are necessary and do right you  would soon see the people get rich. But what are you doing? Are you   rich? No. The Lord can send the grasshopers crickets and locust  They are his armies and can eat us up and kill our cattle. He can  give us much or little as he pleases. If our eyes are single to the  glory of God and we do our duty the Lord could make us as rich as  ^Ceasar^    What would you do with it? Agrandize yourselves?  No you should not; but send out millions of men to gather the poor  and send mules loaded with gold to buy the nations. But now we  are poor and can accomplish but little    Now I am here with brother Kimball. If  you wish to answer ^ask^ any question we can answer right; but for me  to teach the Bishops their duty is folly for I have taught them over  and over for years. Now if I was going to a Ward meeting to preach  and the Bishop was to oppose me unless it was my duty to reprove  him I should sit and laugh at him but not contend with him  but When there is any difficulty between a missionary and a   Bishop or any two men they should not contend about it before  the people but talk it over among themselves and settle all differences  of opinion in the Spirit of God and not labour for the mastery    Remarks Of President Heber C Kimball.    Brother Kimball followed President Young and said    "I am one with President Young and so was J. M.  Grant. He took hold of the work with all his might to wake  up the people and it killed him. If President Young was to ask  me to go forth in the same way I would do it but it would cut short  my life as it did his. I have never felt as though Jedediah was  dead. The saviorur said those that abide in me will never die  His spirit is with us and he can do more for us now than he could  before. The Spirit of God is poured out upon some ma^e^n mightily 
 The reformation is doing good and the people are doing better  and those who get the spirit of God will stand and those who  do not will fall. The people are forsaking their sins    There are things in embryio which will   try this people and those events will ripen as this people do  and all will have to get the spirit and revelation of heaven in  order to stand. And these things will be among all nations  and they will know it as well as I know it    It will be a hard Winter. I want  you to wake up yourselves and then wake up your wives and  children and stop your lying and stealing and take the  burdens upon your backs which belong to you that the  Presidency and Twelve may only have to carry their own burdens    The time has come or is near at hand that  many who have trifled with the Priesthood and the things of God  will be destroyed and go to hell; and those who are not faithful  in magnifying the Priesthood it will be taken from them and  given to others and that quickly and I know it for angels  Prophets and holy men say it and it will be fulfilled    As to dancing I am tired of it. I never  want to see another man dance until he can do it by the  power of God. I felt that Spirit once and brother Brigham  shouted Hosanna for we were both filled with the Spirit.  Neither do I want to see any more feasting at present. I dont  want to see any more jealous feelings. Some of our Bishops get  jealous of the servants of God. No man would be if he was  filled with the Holy Ghost    I would chastize a man if he stood in my  way when I know that I am a messenger sent of God. President  Young says that if the people do not do right he will not stay  long with them but shall go the other side of the veil. If he  goes I shall not stay long behind him because we will not have 
 one between us and if you dont do your duty we shall go soon. I have  had many men try to stand between me and President Young and when  I have been to see him many have snubed me; but I have seen  enough of this; and that man who will try to do it must look out  for God and his angels will smite him    I have no objection to men coming to President  Young to comfort him and do him good and when he gives them a wife  to give him $10 or $20 according as the man may value his wife  but men must not try to seperate us. If they do they will be cursed    I understand that brother Woodruff got a whipping  from one of them lately; but I tell you that although he is a small  man he is all gold and you will find it so in the end. You may  be thankful to ever get as good a place as he will get for he is  the pure gold and I wish you would get as good as he is.    The Bishops will not respect what the missionaries  say for they are jealous. But if you will get the Spirit of  God upon you there will be no jealous feelings in your heart. You  want the Spirit of God and the power of the Priesthood to rest upon  you as it did upon Joseph and does upon the Presidency and Twelve  Take that Priesthood upon you which belongs to you and magnify  it.    The missionaries went ^want^ to wake up. Then wake up the  Bishops and then wake up the people and all live your religion  and all will go well and if you will live ^up to^ your privileges  here and get the spirit of this reformation. It will reach all  over the earth and go to the ends of the earth and the wicked  will not have power over us; but this work will go from Zion  through all the world as the sap of a tree will go from the  trunk to the end of every limb and twig    I want to see the power of God among  the people that they may have faith to remove mountains if  necessary but the power of God will only increase as the Spirit of 
 God increases among the people that they may have faith to remove  mountains    If we do our duty the United States should be the aggressers  The Lord would say if they came against us "Let my servant Brigham  send 200 men and they would lick them up for God would assist  to fight our battles with the storm hail and snow and they would  be destroyed. I know this would be done but we must get the faith  of the ancients.    As to brother Brigham I have to say that he is just as good  a man as ever was on earth.    Now wake up brethren and purify yourselves  before you try to purify others. Then go forth and lift up your voice  like a trumpet and call upon all men to repent and get full of the  Holy Ghost and there is not a man who will do it but what will be  filled with prophesyings as were the ancient Nephites and little boys  of four years old will prophesy    I do not wish to go to a feast or a dance until  the people reform. There is men enough here to bring forth this reformation  and men will not prosper until they do their duty to God and each  other. I have no desire to attend any recreation until this people  are filled with the Spirit and power of God and I do not think that  President Young has. If you will rise up and do your duty you  will be blessed and no man that rises up against us in this place  will prosper if we do our duty and we wash our feet against them  I believe in washing our feet against our enemies    The Spirit of God has been upon us for  more than a year and the people would play laugh and trifle about  it but if they had had the Spirit of God and had done their duty  they would have seen it. This has been my feelings all the time  I have felt that the people were trifling with the things of God    Brother Jedediah is fallen. A mighty  man is taken from us but his power is here. It still rests upon 
 brother Brigham and myself and when we lay hands upon another man  the Spirit of God and of Jedediah will rest upon him in full force  that he may do the work, and fill his place as a councillor to the President  and I know it. May God bless you: Amen.    Others spoke and then Brigham Young said: The reason  why we take the Elders for missionaries who have just came in is that  we can set them to work while their armour is on for it has generally  been the case that soon after the Elders come in they throw down their  armour and some are so far left to themselves that they do not enjoy  the Spirit of God. In answer to the question of brother Savage about  people restoring what they have stolen: In the first place I would  say I would not steal but where it cannot be restored I would say  put it into the P.[erpetual] E.[migration] Fund to gather the poor for I would not have anything  to do with it.    Others spoke and Hopkins Pendo^r^ John M Jones and Joshua  Midgely were called to go out on mission and the Bishops with their council  the First Presidency of the Seventies the Presidents of the Elders Priests  Teachers and Deacons quorums were all requested to meet with the  missionaries in the same place on Monday evening each week.  Benediction by Jacob Gates.    On the 10th I had an interview with Orson Hyde  who had just returned from Carson Valley    Removal of the Legislature of Utah to G. S. Lake City    On the 12th I called at President Young's Office. He was  still unwell. Orson Hyde H. C. Kimball and myself and  G. D. Grant were in the office and H Stout and J W. Cumings  had just arrived from Filmore. The President soon came in  and they gave an account of their proceedings while at Filmore  The Legislature had met there organized passed some resolutions  removed the seat of Government to Great Salt Lake City and  adjourned to meet in G. S. L. City on the ^18th^ day of Dec. 1856. 
 1856    A Dream of Heber C Kimball's  on the night of Nov 25, 1856    Brother Heber C Kimball related the following:    "I dreamed that I was travelling with a companion  and we came to a powerful rapid stream of water like the Niagara   River. The waves were rolling very high and increasing in  size. The waters had been muddy but were getting clear  As we came to this powerful stream we did not know ^how^ we should  get over it. I turned my eyes a few moments from my companion  and when I looked back I saw him on the other side of the  river and climbing a steep hill. I did not know how he  got there. I wanted to cross so I called to him as loud  as I could. ^to stop and wait ^to^ for me but he paid no attention to me but went on as hard as he could.^ Then a person came to me and said you have  an iron rod in your hand, which I perceived I had several  feet long. The angel said to me you must use this rod  and feel your way over the river and I awoke. I considered  my dream and interpret it as follows:    My companion was J. M. Grant who has  suddenly died and left me and is the other side of the veil.  The waters mean the people in ^they are increasing in strength^ and growing better and  clearer. The iron rod is the word of God which I must  cling to till I get through death. I consider there are  great things awaiting this people.    On the 14th of December at 4 o'clock the  emigration came in, about 30 teams with 200 souls all in good  order none of them frozen teams looked well. There was but  8 inches of snow at Bridger but 15 feet in the mountains where  they had to dig through. Next day the remainder of the  emigration arrived with 20 teams and 200 souls. This was  the last ox train company. 
 I attended meeting with the missionaries and Bishops  Wilford Woodruff said we have missionaries and Bishops from some  20 Wards and I would like to have a report from them all. I will give  each man some 3 minutes to speak in; then all can speak. They  all spoke. Bishop Hunter and J. C. Little spoke first. Wilford Woodruff  gave some counsel.    On the 17th in company with Brother Blair I called  upon Brother Ballantine who had sent for me to administer to him  He was quite sick. We laid hands upon him and rebuked his  desease and he was better. He had dreamt that he was about to  die and saw his coffin and grave which was dug deep. Just before  he was to die he thought he was invited to a wedding but he was  too sick to go. And he dreamed that brother Woodruff with  some other one came to him and administered to him and he  was saved from death.    The Legislative Assembly met on the 18th   of Dec. in the Music Hall according to the adjournmet at  Filmore. The two houses organized and we received the  Governor's Message and met in joint sessions then adjourned  to our respective rooms.    On Sunday the 21st after others had spoken  I arose and the power of God rested upon me and I called upon  Elder Orson Hyde to rise up in the power of God and lead out  as he was the President of the Twelve and awake up and get the  Holy Ghost and the Twelve will follow you in the field and  I called upon the people to awake and listen to the words of the   Presidency of the Church.    On the following Sunday Elder Hyde preached  upon the ^parable of the^ 10 Virgins; I followed him but was somewhat tied.  In the afternoon Lorenzo Snow and F. D. Richards spoke both  in the power of God. I followed and the Spirit of the Lord  rested upon me and I asked the people which they would do go 
 to and get the power of God and sustain the Melchezedic Priesthood with  the First Presidency and Twelve or would they reject it and have the  Presidency and Twelve and the Melchezedic Priesthood taken from  them and only the Aaronic Priesthood govern them and the law of  carnal commandments. The people must do one or the other    On the 29^th^ Lorenzo Snow and myself went up  to President Young's Office where we found him Heber C. Kimball  and Orson Hyde. I Wilford Woodruff told President Brigham  Young that we had drawn up a few lines for the Presidents of the  Seventies to sign. I also said to him that I would not ask  my brethren to do what I was not willing to do myself and inasmuch  as I received my Apostleship from yourse hands I now surrender  it unto you and throw myself into your hands and if there is  any other man in Israel that you think will fill my place  better than I do I will freely take it and not complain about  it. Elder Lorenzo Snow said the same thing to President Young  So also did Orson Hyde.    President Young replied, "As for you brother  Woodruff and brother Snow I have never known you when  you more felt the responsibility of your Apostleship or was as well  qualified to magnify your calling as at the present time; but as  for you brother Hyde I will say if you do not magnify your  calling better than you have done I shall object to your standing  where you do if nobody else does for you have not had the spirit  of your calling upon you. You have been trying to build  yourselves up and not the Kingdom of God"    I remarked yes brother Hyde the quorum   of the Twelve feel this and have felt it for a good while. We want  you to take hold and lead as you are our President. We want a  leader and if you will magnify your calling we will be with you    President Young also ^made^ some remarks upon Orson   Pratt's course disaproaving of his philosophy and order of reasoning 
 I arose to go out and Brother Brigham said Brother  Woodruff are you going? Come dont be in a hurry. I shall be  jealous of you. Does not the Spirit of God dwell here? I want men  to stop here who has the Spirit of God. It rests me. I am crowded  all day with men and things which makes me weary.    I replied I did not intend to be in a hurry. I   had some appointments which I thought of attending "but I enjoy myself  here and like to be here." So I sat down with my brethren  till meeting time and then with Orson Hyde and Lorenzo Snow  I went to the Seventies Hall and found the Hall full and  F. D. Richard's there making 4 of the Twelve Present    We called upon the Presidents of the Seventies  to speak and all spoke and were followed by the Twelve who  had much of the Spirit and power of God and gave much good  instruction. We also spoke our feelings to the Presidents of  the Seventies concerning their surrendering their presidency to  the First Presidency of the Church.    Baptism of the Legislative Body.  Dec. the 30th 1856.    I met with the Legislative Council in the forenoon. President  Young was present and the Spirit of God was present. The ##John 15|XV  Chapter of St. John## was read and commented upon. It was  then moved that both Houses meet in joint session. We then  came together and speeches were made by Lorenzo Snow Wilford  Woodruff Brigham Young H. C. Kimball and Hosea Stout    Among the remarks made by President Young  was that when the First Twelve were called he and brother Kimball  almost needed a stool in order to reach high enough to tie the shoes of  John Boyanton Lyman Johnson and Wm. E. McLellin but now  they are gone and we remain. Brother Woodruff and Lorenzo  Snow say they never have felt the weight of their Apostleship and 
 responsibility as they do now. This I have known all the  time. If brother Hyde feels the weight of his responsibility as an  Apostle to day I am glad of it for it is the first day of his life  that he ever did feel it.    Many other remarks were made and it was  finally moved that all the members of the Legislative body of the  Territory of Utah repent of their sins and go to the Font at 6 o'clock  on the Temple Block and be baptized for the remission of their  sins which was carried unanimously.    The Legislature met at the Font as ordered  and they had to fill it with buckets from the Creek; and as the  Presidency and those of the Twlelve at home had been baptized Elder  Franklin Richards went into the water and baptized Elder Orson  Hyde and some 17 others. Then James Cummings went into the  font and baptized some 37 the rest, also the missionaries 37 in  number.    We the Twelve then laid hands upon Elder Orson Hyde  and confirmed ^him^ Elder Orson Hyde, Wilford Woodruff was mouth  The Twelve also confirmed the whole company. I was mouth  in confirming 9 persons and I assisted in confirming 12  others    This was a new feature in Legislation. We believed  that if we could get the Spirit of God we could do business  faster and better than with the spirit of the devil or the  spirit of the world. There were 55 in all baptized.    On the last day of the year I met with  President Young and the Twelve and the missionaries at the  Historian's Office and we heard the report of all the missionaries  and a very interesting address from President Brigham Young  who spoke in the power of God upon our enemies and said  the Spirit of the Lord told him that inasmuch as he   had delivered us through all our troubles thus far while 
 in the land of our enemies that if we would trust still to hHim and ^do^ our  duty the Lord would bless us and still deliver us and that we need  not have any fears    Note. The following to go into my Autobiography in the order of date.    On the evening of the 22nd I attended the Seventies  meeting. There were present of the Twelve Elder Orson Hyde Wilford  Woodruff Lorenzo Snow and F. D. Richards. The first business that  was attended to was the trial G. P. Stiles for adultery. He emphatically  denied it though the testimony was strong against him. A P. Rockwood  was in the stand and he did not know what to do with him. I bore  it as long as I could and then I arose in the Stand and said:    "George P. Styles, I am going to ask you a  question and if you are i^in^nocent you shall proclaim your i^in^nocence  but if you are guilty dont you deny it before God the Holy Ghost  and these witnesses. If you do the judgements of God shall  follow your footsteps from this hour till you go to your grave  and from thence to hell."    I put the question and he did not deny it nor  acknowledge it so he was cut off from the Church.    All the members of the Twelve present then spoke  and the power of God rested upon us like fire shut up in our  bones and many things were revealed to us. We advised the  Presidents of the Seventies to go forward and present their resignation  to President Young and let men take their places who could  magnify the office    On the following day I met in the Legislative  Council. There was no spirit to transact business. Lorenzo  Snow moved that President Kimball should give us an address    President Kimball said, "I do not feel much  like speaking to day. I feel feeble in body and want my liberty  to act as I am moved upon by the Holy Ghost.    But he began to talk and the power of God 
 came upon him and he spoke for an hour. I followed him and the  room was filled as with consuming fire and all the members of the  house came in and they all spoke until sundown and the house  was filled with the Spirit of God almost to the consuming of our  flesh and many things were revealed which were marvellous    I attended the Bishops meeting in the evening  Orson Hyde W. Woodruff Lorenzo Snow and F. D. Richards of the  Twelve were present and the fire of God was still with us. I   never spent such a day and night in Israel before.    Next day I reported to President Young  what we had done in relation to the Presidents of the Seventies and  Judge Stiles in cutting him off for adultery and President Young  approved of what we had done. He also told me to go  through the city and remove all the stumbling blocks I could and  where I found a Bishop or any other man who was in his way to   remove him and put a better man in his place.

The new year came in with a tremendious  snow storm. I spent a good part of new year's day  with President Young and F. D. Richards. President Young  gave us good counsel and wished us to become Saviors upon  Mount Zion and told us in what way that we might have  a crown of glory in the eternal world.    In the Historians Office on the 3rd  ^Note^ President Kimball said he did not believe in the custom of   adoption that had been practised in this Church. No man  should give his birthright to another but should keep his  birthright in the linage of his fathers and not give it to   another go to and unite the link through the whole linage  of their fathers until they come up to a man in the linage who  held the Priesthood. The branch of a vine still abides  in the vine though it comes out of it. Unless thisthe vine is cut  off or the branch it will abide in it. A man should  keep his Priesthood and unite it with his fathers and not give 
 it to another and the Lord will save our fathers. Every man who gets  his patriarchal blessing and Priesthood becomes the Patriarch of his own  family and he should bless his own family.    I continued daily attending meetings and the Legislature  The following is    A Synopsis of President Young's Remarks  In the 18 Ward Jan. 11th 1857    It is right that we should meet together often to pray sing preach and  receive instruction in order to assist us to live our religion; but none  of these things or any of the ordinances of the Gospel which we administer  to the children of men or to each other benefit the Lord. Our worshiping  the Lord is no particular benefit to our Father in heaven; but it is all  entirely for our own benefit and in this light we should view it    There is a doctrine taught from the Stand and  frequently taught in public that we should follow Brother Joseph or  Brother Brigham or any man who leads and do as they say and obey  them and that is all that is required; but this is a false doctrine in one  sense. For I will say no man should trust to the testimony  of another but he should go to ^God^ and get the testimony for himself.  This every man and woman should do.    I might have heard Joseph Smith preach and  testify of the truth of the Book of Mormon and this work until he  had been as old as Methuselah and in the end I should have  snaped my fingers at him and said to him you are a foolish  old man and turned upon my heels and walked off if I had  not have had some other testimony besides his; but I went to the  Lord and the Lord revealed to me that it was true and that it was  his work and I received it upon that principle, I have  lived upon that principle from that day to this    It is the right privilege and duty of every man  and woman to get the revelation of Jesus Christ for themselves and 
 every person should get the Spirit of God and live by it and if all  would do this there would not be a man ^or woman^ unhappy in this Territory and  the flood of complaint which now salute my ears of husbands and wives  complaining of each other would be done away    One man comes and says my family will not  be subject to me. Another woman says my husband abuses  me and I want a bill to get away from him and a thousand complaints  come pouring in upon me none of which I should hear if the people  lived by the Spirit of God. You should all obtain the Spirit   of God and overcome your passions.    When you get angry you should put a piece  of Indian rubber in your mouth and bite it until you could get   perfect control over your passions. Do not speak while you  are angry for you will say something that you will be sorry for  but if you will keep your thoughts to yourself when you are angry  They will not become the property of another.    Any person who is acquainted with me knows  that I have control over myself. I do not speak in anger to  my wives children or the people. I make all my passions be  in subjection to the priesthood and the Spirit of God    People cannot fulfil their calling and  do their duty unless they are filled with the Holy Ghost. I do  not know that there is a female in Israel worthy of the appellation  of a Mother in Israel. For any women to raise up children  unto the Lord as they should do they should do they should  be filled with the Holy Ghost when they conceive and continue filled  with the Holy Ghost until the child is born and weaned and then  the mother should have the Holy Ghost to teach the child until  he is grown up.    So the father should be filled with the Holy  Ghost when he begets a child and he also should be filled  with the Holy Ghost in order to train up that child right 
 that it will be holy unto the Lord and will have power with God. These  are true principles.    The Saints should bring all their passions in subjection  to the laws of God.    I am learning every day I live. I see some who  will bear testimony that they know that Joseph was a Prophet and the  Book of Mormon true and that this is the work of God; and yet  if anything is said which comes contrarry to their selfish dispositions  they will manifest the most stuborn will and will not move one hair  from what their wicked dispositions dictate. I see it in families.  One will growl because one drops a mop at their door or does something  that does not please them. They have no disposition to do anything  only for their own gratification; but this is not right. You  should feel like this: What can I do to help you? I am not  above helping my neighbor. Do you want your shoes blacked?  I will black them. I am not too good to do it.    This is the way you should feel for the  Lord will reward you according to your work    There are many in this Territory who are  miserable. Why? Because they have not the Spirit of God  They do wrong and get into the dark but no person should be  miserable who has received the Holy Ghost. They should  be happy all the time—day and night.    On Sunday the 1st of Feb. the Tabernacle was  filled to overflowing. While A. Cordon was speaking H. C.  Kimball came in and soon after President Young whose coming  created quite a sensation among the people for it was the first  time he had been seen in the Tabernacle since the day that  J. M. Grant was buried. Brother Cordon soon stoped  and President Young arose and addressed the people for about  one hour and a half and he spoke in great plainness of the  things of the Kingdom of God. 
 On Sunday the 8th in the prayer circle President  Young in speaking of a blank in the History said that it was during  that time in the fall and Winter of 1844 that Sidney Rigdon preached  his great sermon when he was going to take Queen Victoria by the  nose. We did a good deal of work at the time on the  Temple and it was difficult to get bread for the hands to eat  I told the people or the committee who had charge of the Temple means  to deal out all the flour they had and God would give them more  and they did so. And it was but a short time before Brother  Toronto came and brought me twenty five hundred dollars in   gold. The committee and the Bishop met and I met with  them and they said that the law was to lay the gold at the  Apostles' feet. Yes I said and I will lay it at the Bishop's  feet: so I opened the mouth of the bag and took hold of the bottom  end and gave it a jerk towards the Bishop and strewed the  gold across the room at his feet. I said now go and buy  flour for the workmen on that Temple and dont distrust the  Lord any more for we will have what we need.    On the 9th my father Aphek Woodruff  was taken sick with the Billious cholic and continued very  ill for some days and I thought he was ^striken with^ taken for death  but he recovered    On the following Sunday after a pleasing discourse  from George Sims Aropene the Utah chief delivered a powerful  discourse and exhorted the Saints in the strongest manner to  follow their leaders and do right and not drink wiskey  or do wrong in anything.    I spoke after him and told the people  to lay that exhortation to heart as it was given by a Lamanite  chief.    On the 17th in company with F. D. Richards I called  upon President Young and asked him what I should do where 
 counsel was asked of me either by the Seventies or Bishops. Joseph Young  said to the quorums of the Seventies that when they were called to be   Bishops or Councillors that they might still retain their place as Presidents  of the Seventies and not be ordained High Priests. Bishop Hunter  thinks they should be ordained Bishops and High Priests. What shall   I do about it?    President Young said that if they would go there and  hold their tongues about it they might stand as they are and act as  councillors to a Bishop; but if they will not, ordain them.    I said I thought men ought to walk in the channel  pointed out for them and not complain about it. President Young  said, "Yes; let them do as they are told."    I attended the Bishops' meeting in the evening  Bishop Hunter spoke and I followed him    I told the Bishops to impress upon the minds of the  people the necessity of living their religion after this date for if the  people again commit sin after being forgiven as they now were  they would not again be forgiven but the justice of the law  would be brought against them and they would have to pay the  penelty or be cut off from the Church    Again I told them they should not boast of their  authority and power or that a Seventy was greater than a High  Priest or a High Priest greater than a Seventy. No man should  boast of the power of the priesthood until he obtained some of that  power and it was manifested upon him and when that was   upon him he certainly would not boast of it, for the Holy  Spirit would teach him sense enough to know better.    It is very seldom that I have known the power  of the Priesthood made manifest upon the children of men in  our day to a very great degree; but in some instances it  was as in the case of the Prophet Joseph at the time he  was full of the sick and dying at his door-yard and they 
 were strewed along the bank of the river for two miles and  Joseph rose up and shook himself like an old lion and commenced  at his tent door and healed all the people who were not dead,  on both sides of the river, by the power of God and his voice  was as the voice of God and the earth almost trembled under his  feet as he went along commanding the sick to arrise and be made  whole.    It was also manifest with Joseph while in prison and   in chains in Missouri and his ungodly wicked persecutors  gathered around him and while he was fast in chains with  his brethren yet they goaded his feelings by boasting of how  many murders they had committed and rapes upon Mormon  womaen and how they had cut the Mormons to pieces and  then they would blaspheme the name of God until his spirit  was reined up and he rose up in the power of God in the midst  of his chains and spoke as in a voice of thunder:    "Silence ye fiends of the pit! I will  not live another moment and hear such vile language from  mortals. Either you are ^or^ I shall die right here or else you  shall cease from boasting of such damnable deeds as you  are guilty of.    They quailed before him ^his words^ like leather wilting  in the flames and they bowed before him and made acknowledgments  to him. This was done by the power of God.    Again David Patten was taken by an  armed mob under a United States warreant and when he  was surrounded by this armed mob of about 40 men under  the garb of law and who would not let him say a word in  his own defence he arose in the power of God and held them  fast to their seats until he had addressed them about half  an hour. He told them they were cowards rascals and  villains and he proved it to them and they had not power 
 to harm a hair of his head and they let him and Warren Parrish go  away.    Again this power was manifested by President Brigham Young   on the Banks of the Missouri River at Winter Quarters when the merchants  brought up goods to sell to the brethren who were going to the Mountains  Old Major Miller the Indian Agent was surrounded by officers and  Miller in order to show his great power told the merchants who owned  some Alkahol not to roll a barrel off from the boat or he would knock  the head in and spill it upon the ground.    President Young steped up and told the men  to roll it out and if Miller spilled it "that moment I will spill his  clarrel."    Miller and all the officers turned pale and the liquor was  rolled out and nobody hurt.    Other instances might be named when the power of the  Priesthood has been manifest but these men have never boasted  of it and never will.    On the 21st I carried to President Young's office a   donation from the Fourteenth Ward Female Relief Society to the Poor  Fund quilts and cloathing amounting to $126    On the 23rd I went to President Kimball and read him  his history. He did not think it full enough    I spent the 28th in compiling the Life and History of  Samuel H. Smith. I also wrote two letters to Orson Pratt  Amasa Lyman and Charles C. Rich and one to Phineas Young  requesting them all to forward us a brief history of their lives. I  found it a great difficulty to obtain information concerning Samuel  H. Smith in any history or Journal    My Fiftieth Year  March the 1st 1857    I was fifty years old on this birthday. I had been preserved 
 unto this age through the mercy of my Heavenly Father. I had many  times during my life been snatched from the jaws of death by the power  of God and I had lived to see much of the power of God manifested  and much of his work displayed upon the earth. The last 23  years I had spent in his kingdom and travelled and preached the  Gospel of Jesus Christ, and built up churches to his name; and I  prayed that the rest of my life might be devoted to his service  and that I might do the will of God in all things    Important Items from  President Youngs Discourse.    On Sunday the 8th of March President Young preached one  of the most comforting and interesting discourses ever delivered to the  people. He said if we pass our inspection before Joseph   we probably should Peter and Jesus. That we should be quite  safe. If all this people did not go to a celestial kingdom  it would be their own fault; but will all have the same exaltation  and glory in the celestial kingdom? By no means. There  will be but few who go there who will be crowned kings and  priests and Gods. There will be many millions in the  celestial kingdom who will not be exalted to those higher  blessings. This people are a good ^people^ and they are advancing  faster than any other people who ever lived. It would not  be 120 years instead of 365 before this^ey^ people would with the  portion of earth they occupy be seperated from the whole of the wicked  The Lord will bless this people and if you will do as well as you  know how all will be well with you.    President Young made many glorious remarks.  At the Prayer Circle in the evening the President had Orson Pratt's  pamplet entitled the Holy Spirit read; and upon it President Young  said that Brother Pratt had got beyond the stars. He had  correlled them and got beyond them.    The President asked Wm W. Phelps by what 
 authority he had proclaimed in public that he, Brigham Young, was the man  that the Lord said he would raise up like unto Moses. [##Deuteronomy 18:18##]    Phelps said "Joseph is gone and you are left to lead  the people.    Brigham Young: "That is no argument at all. I might die and  and others be left. That does not prove that I or they would be the one  referred to. If I thought I was the man I would not tell of it. But I   think I am the great man that none of the Prophets ever thought of or  spoke of.    Orson Hyde said that a man in Provo professed to  have a visit from a departed spirit. He comes to him dressed  in his temple robes and the man he comes to has not had his  endowments. I want to know what you think of it. I thought  the whole of it smelt strongly of brimstone    President Young answered, "Now if the  people in Provo can be made to beleive that that is a true visit  about the third time he comes he will say that this Church is  not led by the man who ought to lead the Church. ^but the man who has this visit will tell you that he is to lead the Church^ Now I  will tell you how you may know it is a false. A spirit  will not come to a man in the flesh without he appears in his  glory and man cannot endure his glory; a resurrected body  may come and hide his glory; but that visitation is false.  It is not true"    On the following Sunday President Young  said to Elder Orson Hyde at the Prayer Circle, "You have been  to both Jerusalem and Zion and seen both. I have not seen  either for I never have been in Jackson County. Now it  is a plesant thing to think of to know where the odld Garden of   Eden is. Did you ever think of it or sense it. I do  not think many do. Now Jackson County is the Garden  of Eden. Joseph has declared this and I am as much bound  to believe it as much as I am to beleive that Joseph is a Prophet 
 of God. Many in Jackson County have found out that  they cannot cultivate the Temple Block and other places in that county  We must let the Lord take his own time to prepare the way for  our return to that County to build up that Temple    Joseph's Charge to the Twelve    At a Bishop's meeting on the 17th I made the following  remarks:    There is another subject which I wish to speak of. Brother  Hunter said that he wanted the clerk to keep a record of their  meetings as it would make a good history. This is a subject I  have always felt interested in and as there are many branches in  the Kingdom of God so there should be some person engaged in each  branch.    I have spoken upon the subject of Journal writing  and keeping a history of what transpires within us from day to day  I was deeply impressed with the importance of reading the history of the  organization of the quorum of the Twelve and the remarks of the Prophet  Joseph upon the subject: he said,    "I have for myself learned a fact by experience  which on reflection gives me much sorrow. It is a truth that if  I now had in my possession every decission which has been given  upon important items of doctrine and duties since the rise of this  Church they would be of incalculable worth to the Saints; but  we have neglected to keep a record of such things thinking perhaps  that they never would benefit us afterwards which had we now  would decide any point that might be agitated; and now we  cannot bear record unto the Church ^nor unto the world^ of the great and glorious manifestations  that have been made to us with that degree of power and authority  which we otherwise could if we had those decissions to publish  abroad. 
 through his posterity forever wherever the kingdom of God existed. Then  let every child for the future be begotten in holiness and remember  this one thing—live your religion    I now want to speak of another thing. A small  portion of our time was spent in the Temple at Nauvoo where we   began to administer the ordinances according to the words of ##Malachi 4:5-6|Malachi  in the 4 chapter 5th and 6th verses##—"Behold I will send you Elijah  the Prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the   Lord; and he shall turn the hearts of the Fathers to the children  and the hearts of the children to the Fathers lest I come and smite  the earth with with a curse"    Abraham received a promise from the Lord  that his seed should be saved and all the seed of Abraham  among the Gentile nations or among the uncontaminated of   the house of Israel will be gathered. They have sinned  they have changed the ordinances and broken their covenants   or you would not see the children of these mountains in  the degredation in which we now find them    The Lamanites upon this continent are  Manassahites almost excluseively. There is but little of   the seed of Ephraim among them. They are accounted   as thee Seed of Abraham ^and they must be saved^ or they would not have become  so loathsome as they are. They are punished in the   flesh to make an atonement in the flesh for their sins  and transgressions and when they pass through the veil the   enemy will leave no power over them    In the day of the Lord Jesus Christ all  the particles of the blood of Abraham will be gathered together   The seed of Abraham has not been counted for many years  and never will be again. If an angel was to commence now to  number them all, [illegible]when [illegible]he had got the numbers together, before  they could be computed there would be a great number more 
 born during the time of their numeration so they could not be  numbered and this is the reason why his seed cannot be numbered    Brethren and Sisters you are of the  seed of Abraham and you should live your religion that you may  claim the promises of Abraham    This Priesthood will turn the hearts of  the children to the Ancient Fathers and the Fathers to the children  now, and those which are to come will be made perfect. This  chain must not be broken for mankind cannot be saved  any other way. The Priesthood must be linked together  so that all the children may be linked to Father Adam    It may be asked "When will this  work be done? It will be done in temples in our day  and in the days of our children. We shall go into the  Temples and be pillars therein and go no more out; and we shall  plant trees and vineyards and eat the fruit thereof. I wall call  it the Millennium. I carry it in my heart. I say it has  begun. Every Saint carries carries it with him    Then let us increase in every good thing  and we shall extend this influence from Zion until it roots  out every evil and brings all in subjection to the Kingdom  of our God.    We will administer in the Temple which we  have now begun and that is one point gained and we will  seal man to man by the keys of the Holy Priesthood. This  is the highest ordinance. It is the last ordinance of the  Kingdom of God on the earth and above all the endowments that  can be given you. It is a final sealing—an eternal principle  and when once made cannot be broken by the Devil    When we return to Zion and build  the great Temple which Joseph Saw, and the centre of  Zion is established the glory of God will rest upon it by 
 Since the Twelve are now chosen I wish to tell them a course  which they may pursue and be benefited hereafter in point of light of which   they perhaps are not aware    At all times when you assemble in the capacity of a Council   to transact buisness let the oldest of your number preside and let one or   more be appointed to keep a record of your proceedings and on the   decission of every important item let it be what it may let us ^such^ decesion   be noted down and they will ever afterwards remain upon record as law  covenant and docrtrine. Questions thus decided might at the time   appear unimportant, but should they be recorded and one of you lay   hands upon them afterwards you might find them of infinite worth   not only to your brethren but a feast also to your own souls    Should you assemble from time to time and procede  to discuse important subjects or questions and pass descisions upon   them and omit to record such decisions by and by you will be   driven to straits from which you will not be able to extricate   yourselves not being in a position situation to bring your faith to   bear with sufficient perfection or power to obtain the desired   information.    Now in consequence to write of a neglect to write these  things when God revealed them not esteeming them of sufficient worth   the Spirit may withdraw and God may be angry. And here   is a fountain of intelligence or knowledge of infinite importance   which is lost. What was the cause of this? The answer is   slothfulness or neglect to appoint a man to occupy a few moments   in writing.    Here let me prophesy the time will come when if you  neglect to do this you will fall by the hands of unrighteous men. Were   you to be brought before the authorities and accused of any crime   or misdemienor and be as innocent as the angels of God unless   you can prove that you were somewhere else your enemies will  prevail against you; but if you can bring twelve men to testify 
 day and by night and those who are prepared will see the face of the Son  of Man and they will see Joseph and Hyrum in the flesh in their  resurrected bodies. Then will the armies of Israel be terrible to all  nations; then will ^one^ chase a thousand and two put ten thousand to flight    Who will resurrect Joseph's body? It will  be Peter James John Moroni or some one who has or who will receive  the keys of the resurrection. It will probably be one of those  who holds the keys of this dispensation and has delivered them to  Joseph. And you will see Jesus and he will eat peaches and  apples with you but the world will not see it or know it for  wickedness will increase. Joseph and Jesus will be there. They  will walk and talk with them at times and no man mistrust who  they are.    Joseph will lead the armies of Israel whether he is  seen or not, whether visible or invisible as seemeth him good. Joseph   has got to receive the keys of the resurrection for you and I.  After he is resurrected he will go and resurrect brother Brigham  Brother Heber and brother Carlos, and when that is done he will say  now go brother Brigham and resurrect your wives and children  and gather them together. While this is done the wicked will  know nothing of it though they will be in our midst and they  will be struck with fear. This is the way the resurrection  will be. All will not be raised at once; but it will  continue in this way until all the righteous are resurrected    After Joseph comes to us in his resurrected  body he will more fully instruct us concerning the baptism  for the dead and sealing ordinances. He will say be  baptized for this man and that man; and that man be sealed to that  man and such a man to such a man and connect the Priesthood  together.    I tell you there will not be much of this done  until Joseph comes. He is our Spiritual Father: our hearts 
 are already turned to him and his to us    This is the order of the Holy Priesthood  and we shall continue to administer in the ordinances of the  kingdom of God here on earth. Joseph will not officiate in  this low capacity any more: neither did Jesus, A^a^fter his  resurrection. If so he would have baptized Saul; but  he was exalted above the earth and he told Saul to go to  a certain man in a certain street and he would administer to  him the ordinances upon the earth    I say to you dont hurry in the  ordinances. Dont do what you ought not. It is not  the time to hurry. We should not undertake to do now  what we ought to do fifty years hence. What have we  to do to day^?^ Purify your hearts that you may  receive the manifestation of the Spirit of God    When you sow your wheat you  prepare the ground and then sow your wheat and watch  it till the harvest. It is just so in the Priesthood  You will be just as busy as you can be to do the things  which are to be done to day    Now dont be in a hurry. I say  we are going to have time enough. I say I will be here  on earth to do all I can; and after I die and get my body  again (my resurrected body) I mean to come back to the earth  again and fight the devils and be here at the winding-up  scene. I want to see righteousness prevail and the  Saints have peace on the earth.    I wish now to speak upon another  subject. I am here as the Governor of this Territory  and I wish to comme^e^nd^ce^ my remarks upon this subject with   the President of the United States. Is he the Master  of the United States? No he is not. He is selected 
 that you were in some other place at that time you will escape their hands   Now if you will be careful to keep minutes of these things as I have said it will   be one of the most important and interesting records ever seen. I have now   laid these ^things before your^ consideration and you are left to act according to your own   judgement." (See Record of the Twelve and History of the Church Feb  1835; Historians Office)    I have thus referered to some of the words of Joseph  to the Twelve Apostles at their organization. This shows the feelings   of the Prophet Joseph upon the subject.    I have had this same subject upon my mind ever since  I have been a member of the Church. I have been inspired and moved  upon my mind ever since I have been in the Church. I have been   inspired and moved upon to keep a Journal and write the affairs of this   Church as far as I can. I did not understand why my feelings were   exercised so much in the early age of this Church; but I understand   it now.    I seldom ever heard Brother Joseph or the Twelve preach or teach   any principle but what I felt as uneasy as a fish out of water until I   had written it. Then I felt right. I could write a sermon   of Joseph's a week after it was delivered and almost word for word   and after it was written it was taken from me or from my mind   This was a gift from God unto me and I have kept a Journal of almost   every day of my life for the last 24 years. I could tell each   day what I had done what company I was in and what was transpiring   around me and any teachings or counsels from the Presidency of the   Church except where I knew the reporters had written their discourses   I have urged the same course upon the Twelve and all the quorums   of the Church to keep a record of their meetings and the dealings of God   with them and for all men who hear the Priesthood to keep a   record of their lives especially of all their official acts in the Church   and kingdom of God    You may say that this is a great deal of 
 to sit there as one of our servants to act for us and to do what we wish  to have done. So it is with the Congress and the Governors of the  several States and I am here as one of them as the Servant of the  people    Congress has p^repared^ a Constitution for this Territory which  they call the organic act and have granted certain rights to this people  as a community. They have said this Territory should be  organized thus and so with a Governor and Legislative Assembly  and the right is given to the people to elect twenty six Representatives  and thirteen councillors ann[u]ally. This body may enact laws  to control each of us and all the inhabitants of this Territory  including the Governor the Judges the Secretary the Supreme  Court the District Court and the Probate Court. They have said  they shall have all the power given to them by the Legislative  Assembly.    We have a Legilaslative Assembly and Majestrates  courts. Congress will send certain men to hold Supreme  Courts and send other men as officers to the Territory of Utah  to transact business for the Territory of Utah so as to make it as  easy as possible.    The United States Judges are not here as Kings  or Monarchs but as servants of the people and when you see a  Judge putting a city under "martial law" he manifests boyism  and you should pity him and give him a piece of cake    If a man wants to be what he is not it is  certain that he wants to get out of his sphere. When some  men know a hundred words they think they know all of Webster  Some will try to study a hundred sciences of the day and  then know no more than a child. When a man studies  Divinity five years he is only fit to be put down upon  the ground as a block to stand upon to get upon your  horses. 
 I see some here who have come fifty or  one hundred miles at the squaling of a goose crow and dont you  know that if you want a court held there that the Judges should   go there and hold it? aAnd if a Judge dont know that it is because  he is very ignorant and he ought to learn his duty    I am perfectly astonished at these, my   brethren, to think that if a man takes a pumpkin and says  it is an apple you must acknowledge it is an apple and  swallow it as such or if they take a rotton potatoe and say it  is a peach and cram it down your throat as a peach. When  you see a rotton potatoe why dont you acknowledge it to be a  rotton potatoe    Now I say to you jurimen and witnesses  pack up your deeds and go home and stay there till you have  business. If I come here and act the tyrant instead of  a Governor you ought to kick me out and all officers ought  to be served in the same way when they get out of their  place and act the fool or else let the people swallow the  rotton potatoe and call it a peach    I know the meaning the marrow  and the pith of the laws and the very principle upon which  they are built much better than the Judges do. I know  the meaning of them and the duty of all the officers in this  Territory. I say this for your instruction    To see men come here at the call  of a foolish boy fre[e]zing your toes and killing your horses  in the cold month of December is foolishness. When you   want him send for him and pay your respects to him.    They do not understand the law. When  I see Lawyers and Judges rise up here and saying that our laws  are not right and we should not be governed by them  it puts me in mind it puts me in mind of the anecdote 
 trouble. Very well. It has been so to me in one sense. It has occupied   nearly every leasure moment of my time for 24 years. But what of it?   I have never spent any of my time more profitably for the benefit of mankind   than in my Journal writing for a great portion of the Church History has   been compiled from my Journals and some of the most glorious Gospel   sermons truths and revelations that were given from God through ^to^ this people   through the mouths of the Prophets Joseph Brigham Heber and the Twelve   could not be found upon the earth on record only in my Journals   and they are compilled in the Church History and transmitted to the   Saints of God in all future generations. Does not this pay me for   my trouble? It does.    In many instances in this Church men have been   appointed clerks to write for the Church and they have kept the records   instead of delivering them to the President of the Church to whom they   belonged and soon they would apostatize and then they would insult   the Church by offering to sell them their own records at an enormous   price.    I have deposited my records and Journals in the Historians   Office where I hope they may do some good    We have had a very interesting time this Winter during   the Reformation among the Latter-day Saints. The spirit and   power of God have been poured out in a wonderful manner and   many glorious truths have been revealed through the Presidency a  Twelves and others and in various quorums meetings. Now should   not there be a record kept of those things? In the commencement   of these meetings the clerks took quite full reports but thinking   it too much trouble they now thake them very short and we can   hardly get an outline of the real facts of our meetings and the   power of God and the dealings of God with us    Every man should keep a brief history of his  life his parentage his birth his religion when he was baptized   and by whom; when he was ordained and by whom and what to 
 of the fox that went to the hencoop to catch some chickens. The owner  had put a cord from the platform to a bell overhead so that as soon  as the platform was touched the bell would ring. As soon as the  fox jumped on to the platform the bell rang and away the fox ran  with all his might but on looking behind him he saw nothing so he  went back to the coop and examined to see what the matter was  He touched the cord with his foot and the bell rang but did not  hurt so he jumped into the coop and got his chickens. He looked  up and saw that the bell was hollow and had a long tongue and  the fox exclaimed "You are a poor miserable hollow-headed devil."    Lawyers and Judges should be made to  keep the laws of this Territory as well as other citizens and if they  wont do it put them in the way that they will be made to; and  if I say to every man who has no business here pack up your goods  and go home: let the Judges honor me and our laws and the officers  of this Territory or they will not receive any honor from me    I see one man on my right who will go  straight and tell the Judges what I have said. He is a kind  of perpetual telegraph and if any man comes to me and says  Brother Brigham do you mean me^?^ I will say you are the man.  (alluding to Elisha Hoopes)    Speech of Kn^a^osh the Indian Chief ^of the Parvans^    On the 16th in the afternoon K^a^nosh delivered to us a speech  The following are some of his remarks    "I am just beginning to get my eyes open  I know that President Young's talk is good. What he says  is so. He tells us more good. I am like the sun just  rising in the East and so with my people. We have been  in the night. I have had eyes but I could not see and  ears but I could not hear; and this has been the case with 
 my people: our hearts could not understand; but now our eyes  see our ears hear and our hearts understand. All that  Brigham and Heber has said is straight; but when I talked   to Col. Steptoe and his men their talk was not straight. I  could not believe for a tenth part of their talk is not true  and so with the Spaniards and all white men till I saw the  Mormons. They are the first to tell ^me the^ truth    You are here to make laws. I hope  you will make good laws to punish the guilty and spare the  innocent.    I wish to do right and have my people do right  I do not whant them to steel nor kill. I want to plant and  raise wheat and learn to plough and do as the white people  This I am going to do in the Spring. I want to learn to  read and write and have my children; so that we can understand  what you say to us that is good"    On the 18th the Legislature met at  the State House and adjourned till ^the 2nd^ Monday ^in^ December the  After adjournment the Governor and all the Northern  members and Judges started for home and arrived in Great  Salt Lake City on the 21st    Mass Meeting    In Great Salt Lake City  January the 26th 1856    According to the adjournment at Filmore a mass meeting  of the people conveined in the Tabernacle for the purpose of  taking into consideration the propriety of establishing  a daily express and passenger communication ^between^ the Western  States and California. The meeting was organized 
 and Charles C Rich return to the seat of war and take charge of the command    The following is a synopsis of a conversation of President  Young. He said:    "If any officers come to the army—the Governor or Judges and  send word that they want to come in just inform them that they are as near  as they can come. Had they have come without a military araray they  could have come and not have been molested but now they cannot come  We will not have any cursed scoundrel forced upon us to judge or rule  over us and they shall not come among us    If Johnson comes with troops and intends to come  in I expect they will leave their baggage battary and a company to guard  it and come in on a forced march without it. Then we must not let  them sleep but use them ^up^ us as soon as we can. Work night and day  and not let them sleep. Brother Wells thinks they are determined  to come in. I have sent word that if General Harney is on his  way to get into camp and kill him if possible and take the the animals  from Johnson if possible and take charge of the goods train. President  Young said I am glad of one thing; ie, this thing will be just as  the Lord wants it. If he wants them to come and get killed  it will be so. If he wants them to go North South or East he  will have it just as he wants and this I am thankful for and I feel  perfectly easy about it all.    You will find that when the Lord sees that we  are willing to fight and get just ready to shoot that he will fight our  battles. He said George A Smith may stop in the city this  time. Let Charles C Rich go. He is a good General and a wise  man in calculation. I reckon a good deal upon him in the  future.    On the next day the 29 General D. H. Wells with his  companions left the city to take command of the Expedition in  the mountains and the company of cavalry commanded by Heber  Kimball also went out. 
 He should give a brief sketch of all his missions and of all his official   acts and the dealings of God with him. Then if he was to die and   the historians wished to publish his history they would have something   to go by.    Many think that this is a dry subject and unimportant   but it is not so to me. I am now trying to get up a history of   the Twelve Apostles as first organized. Half of them are now   out of the Church and scarcely any record left whereby I can get   a correct knowledge of their history in the ministry of this work   and some of those who remain and are laboring to build up the  Kingdom of God have not kept a record of their missions ministry   official acts and edecissions upon important subjects and the gifts   graces and dealings of God with them sufficient to give a true  and correct history of their lives    There are but a few aside from the Presidency   of the Church who feel the importance of this subject sufficient to   put it into practice. The majority think the matter not   important; but I believe it is otherwise.    The Prophets would not have been moved   upon to exhort us to faithfulness upon this subject had it not been   important. The Lord has told us that what we seal on earth   shall be sealed in heaven and what we record on earth shall be   recorded in heaven and what is not sealed or recorded on earth   is not sealed or recorded in heaven. Therefore it appears to be   very important that we do keep a true and faithful record in all   things.    While walking in a rapid stream we cannot tread twice in   the same water neither can we spend twice the same time. When   we pass out of that door the work of this meeting will be closed   to us forever. We shall never ^again^ spend the time of this evening   Then should we not keep a record of our work teachings and   counsels which we give in this meeting? We should. 
 by choosing Governor Young President; Chief Justice J. F. Kinney  Heber C. Kimball J. M. Grant Almon W. Babbit J. P. Stiles  D. H. Burr D. H. Wells G. Hurt W. Bell W. Garrish and  Parley P. Pratt were chosen Vice Presidents and Wilford Woodruff  Orson Pratt and Wm H. Hooper Secretaries and George D. Watt  reporter.    The President stated the object of the meeting and  made a few remarks; after which Almon W. Babbit delivered  an address and was followed by Judge Stiles Dr Hurt T. S.  Williams J. C. Little Enoch Reese O. P. Rockwell S. M. Blair  and W. H. Hooper. Mr Thomas Bullock read several  resolutions upon which the Governor offered some suggestions.  Whereupon a Committee was appointed to draft resolutions to  be presented at the next meeting to be held at the same  place Feb. the 2nd at 1 o'clock P.M.    The adjourned Mass Meeting conveined per  adjournment and was addressed by Enoch Reese Jedediah M. Grant  Judge Kenney Leonard W. Hardy O. P. Rockwell and closed  with a lengthy good speech from Governor Young.    The 6, 7, 8 and 9th I spent mostly up till 10  o'clock at night in President Young's Office in company withe  Brothers Watt and Samuel Richards in making the manuscript  for the First Reader to be published in the Deseret Alphabet  I spent some time in scearching other books for matter but my  mind was ledd to choose finally our own experience travels incidents  history doctrines and our location and we commenced to write  upon these subjects.    Sunday followed and on the Monday we  resumed our work upon this matter of the Reader and the  Deseret Alphabet. In the evening the committee met with  the Regency at the President's upper room and the work of the  committee was read and accepted. Another Committee 
 of Revision was appointed to ^assist^ us the first Committee. They were Albert  Carrington Daniel H. Wells and W. Willis    In a prayer circle on Sunday the 17th President  Young asked Orson Pratt what he thought of his preaching that  intelligent beings would continue to learn to all eternity.    Orson Pratt replied that he believed the Gods had  a knowledge at the present time of everything that did or will exist to  the endless ages of all eternity. He believed it as much as any truth  he had ever learned in or out of the Church    President Young remarked that he had never learned  that principle in the Church; for it was not true: it was false  doctrine; for the Gods and all intelligent beings would never cease  to learn except it were the Sons of Perdition: they would continue  to decrease until they became dissolved back into their native  element and lose their identity    On the evening of the same day Parley P.  Pratt preached a good discourse in the 14th Ward. He told the  Bishop to cut off all the liars thieves adulterers and profane swearers  from the Church for they would rot the body if they continued  on it. He said many wicked men would stick by the  Church but they would never repent of their sins. There was  a time when man could repent but when that time was past  men might pray till their knees where [were] callaced and they could  not get the Spirit of God. How long did the people who  were destroyed in the flood have to wait before they could  have the offer of the Srpirit of God or the Gospel? They  had to wait more than two thousand years, till after Christ  came and was crucified. He then went and preached to the  "Spirits in Prison." The Gospel was then offered unto them.  And how has it been with the Jews. They once saw the  day when the Gospel was offered unto them but when  they put to death their King and Saviour the Gospel 
 Again Elders go forth upon missions to the nations of the earth   They have to enter into a regular warefare. The Lord pours out his Holy Spirit   upon them and they war with the world the flesh and the devil, with   kings princes lords presidents and rulers. They are cast into prison   and the Lord delivers them. The devil enters into some of their   converts and they lay hands upon them and cast them out. The   Saints are sick and they heal them. They prophesy in the name   of the Lord and their words come to pass. Rulers declair that   they shall not preach to the people on pain of death. They preach  the word of God and many believe obey and rejoice in the Lord   and they are protected by the power of God. They goes upon   the sea and the storms rage and the^y^ calms them water and   wind in the name of the Lord. They are shielded and   goverened by the angels of God all the day long and they know   the power of God is with them revealing unto them the evils  that lie in their path.    And yet the Elders do not view these great and   important things of value enough to make a record of them to   spend a short time in writing them; and the circumstance  and history of these blessings unto them are lost both to the present   and the future generations. Are these things right? I do   not believe they are. I do not believe men are justified in   neglecting to record these things    Now as an example: Should the ten lost   tribes of Israel suddenly come pouring down upon us in the land   of Zion led by the Holy Prophets of God what would be one of   the first enquiries we should make of them? It would be where   are your records and History and the revelations and dealings   of God with you since you were led away under Shalmaezar   king of Asyria? O do let me see and read them and do   let me have the journal of your travels from the North country   to our land of Zion 
 On the 3rd of Nov. an express arrived and brought  a letter from Col. Alexander thanking Governor Young for sending him  his prisoners and saying that he should send back those he held only  he had a civil process against them. Probably his intention was to  hang them for treason.    Vision Of Angels In the Temple of Kirtland  Related by President Young  Nov 8th    In our prayer circle on this Sunday President Young related the  circumstance of the brethren seeing a circle of about 40 persons dressed  in white robes and caps in the upper room of the Temple Kirtland  during the Spring of 1835 after the endowments. There was  no person in the room at the time who was mortal yet the room  was filled with light and many personsages appeared clothed in white  and frequently went to the windows and looked out so that the brethren  in the streets could see them plainly. Brother Young and Truman  O Angel stood together in the street and looked at them. W. W.  Phelps says he saw them for 3 hours. They were visible by all  the brethren present. Brother Angel said they must have stood  some two feet from the floor as they were only the size of common  men. They could not have been seen from the place where  they stood except it had been the head and those personages  appeared nearly down to the waist as they looked out of window  with a front view    Col. Johnson's Arrival in Camp    Col Albert S. Johnson commander ^had^ arrived in the camp of  the main army and on the night of the 8th an express arrived  in the city with the news and the fact that the calvary was advancing  upon Bridger under a gallop and our picket guard had to run 
 was taken from them and given to the Gentiles. It was also given   to the Lamanites and the Ten Tribes of Israel. The first were  to be last and the last first. It will now come to the Gentiles  first then to the ten tribes of Israel and the Lamanites before it  will go to the Jews: they will be the last to receive it. Who has  ever heard of the Jews having the Spirit of God or the Gospel or Kingdom  of God offered to the Jews since they put to death Jesus Chirist and  the Kingdom went to the Gentiles? No one for it has never been  done. They will go home in unbelief and wickedness and  rebuild Jerusalem in that state and they will be so far from the  Gospel that when the Gentiles come against them to battle rifle  their houses ravish their women and carry half of their city into  captivity and Jesus Christ comes and delivers them in the midst  of this hour of peril and trouble they will not know him nor  even imagine who he is till they ask him about his wounds  and he tells them. Then the Gospel has to be preached to  them and they will repent be baptized and receive the first  principles of the Gospel    Parley also said there was a promise  that the Three Nephites and angels should visit the Lamanites  but they could not be sent to them to receive with messages to  receive and obey the Mormons until all the Mormon Missionaries  were righteous men and would not steal lie sware or commit  adultary for if the angels were to tell them to obey the  Mormons and and they found the Mormons to do wickedly  they would lose confidence in both the angels and the  Mormons    On Sunday the 24 President Brigham Young  took up the subject of the Courts as held in Great Salt Lake  City and also the ungodly course of the lawyers. He cursed them  in the name of the Lord with a great curse and all Israel  said Amen. He called Zerubable Snow by name and he 
 And what would be our disapointment should their Prophets and Elders   say, O we have not got any history of the dealings of God with us nor   any journal of our travels. We used to hear our fathers say that   there had been great and mighty things done in the land where we   lived. The Saviour came and taught great and marvellous things  and we had a glorious time in coming here. We smote the rocks and   the mighty mountains of ice fell down with a great noise and great   miracles were wrought but our fathers had so much to do and we have   had so much to do that we never had any time to write anything   about it and we did not think that any body would have any interest in   it but ourselves, and so we did not write    Should we not be greatly disappointed?   We should; and so with them if they should ask us for our records   and say that Jesus and the angels told us that you were building   up Zion and doing a great work in the earth and that great and   glorious things were revealed unto you and we now wish to read those   things. an And should we tell them that we had done as they had   not kept a record of any of these things, they would be like ourselves   much disappointed. But if they and ourselves should both keep   a strict account of all that is useful then it would add great joy   to both thayt [they] and us. Then let us lay these things to heart and   keep a true and faithful record that we may be justified   before God.    On Monday the 23rd I dedicated the new font   in the 14th Ward for baptizing and at the close of the dedication   prayer Franklin D. Richards went into the font and baptized his   father and about 40 others. I went into the School House and   assisted in confirming 14. Samuel Richards was mouth in confirming   his father. The Elders continued to baptize and confirm   members of the 14th Ward throughout the day.    I continued my labors in the Historians   Office till as usual which filled up the interval to Conference 
 he cursed him and all that he had.    The Indians again commenced their depredations  and killed 3 boys and drove off horses and cattle. Several of the  Indians had been killed and wounded.    I was 49 years old on the 1st of March 1856    The Indian war continued three more of the brethren  had been killed. Squash^ead^ of the War Chiefs was put in prison  and the report was that he had cut his own throat. He was dead    I received a mission from President Young  on the 3rd to prepare to go East in the Spring to get the Deseret  Alphabet type made and some books printed in it    I met with the Regency on the 11th. The  subject was brought up concerning Adam being made of the  dust of the earth. Orson Pratt pursued a course of stubborness  and unbelief in what President Young said    Baptism of my Family over 8 Years    March the 16th    On this day I baptized all my family who were over  eight years of age and on the 18th Mrs Phebe Woodruff and  myself took our two oldest children Wilford and Phebe to the  house of the Lord to receive their endowments. I washed  and anointed my son Wilford and ordained him to the office  of an Elder and sealed upon him all the blessings of his  ordination anointing and my birthright in compliance with  the counsel of President Kimball.    Thus was fulfilled the blessing of  Father Joseph Smith the first Patriarch who sealed upon  my head before I had any children that I should have  posterity who should receive the Priesthood and my oldest  son received it this day under my hands 
 their horses to get out of the way.    When I arose on the morning of the 9th I found the  earth covered with snow and that the city had been alive with our  soldiers since midnight preparing to go into the mountains to meet with  the enemy.    Col. Johnson said to Maj. Allen, of our Expedition, whom they  had taken prisoner "God damn you when I get to Bridger I will hang you."    So Maj. Allen thinking there was not much chance  for his life and prefering shooting to hanging during the same evening,  though closly guarded by 24 men, pulled off his boots and walked up to  a fire to warm his toes and while steping around to warm his feet he  made a spring and cleared himself of the guard.    Escape of Major Allen From the U.S. Army    He ran into the midst of a herd of cattle so they could not shoot  him. Horsemen immediately started in persuit but in the darkness  of the night they could not overtake him. He ran in his stocking  feet in the snow for 30 miles carrying his boots in his hand not daring  to stop to put them on and arrived in our camp in safety.    Our men took 100 head of cattle one night and  300 head another which were now coming into the city    On the 11th Dr Hickman arrived in the city. He had  been a prisoner in the enemy's camp for a long time but they let him  go. 'Twas his opinion that Col Johnson would try to come in. They  talked of breaking up into small companies and trying to come in in  various ways    There had been on the arrival of the first intelligence of  Col Johnson's movements been 1300 men ordered into the mountains besides  those already there. Col Philemon C Merrill commanding the  Davis County troops commenced their march for the Expedition. They  consisted of 242 men 56 of whom were mounted 17 officers of the 
 The usual temporal duties of life and the Sabbath  meetings and services filled up the interval to the April Conference    General Conference  of  The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints  held  In the Bowery Great Salt Lake City  April the 6th 1856    The Conference commenced at 10 o'clock. There were on the Stand  Presidents Young Kimball and Grant and of the Twelve Orson Hyde   Parley P. Pratt Orson Pratt Wilford Woodruff George A Smith Ezra T.  Benson Lorenzo Snow and Erastus Snow with the usual presiding  members and quorums of the Church. The absent members of the  quorum of the Church were John Taylor in New York presiding  over the Churches in the States Franklin Richards in Liverpool presiding  ofver the European Mission and Amasa Lyman and Charles C.  Rich in San Barnadino    At five oclock P.M. of the first day of the  Conference Elders Parley P. Pratt Wilford Woodruff Lorenzo Snow  and Erastus Snow blessed 115 missionaries who were appointed to go  on missions to the Lamanites and to the nations. This first  day was occupied by President Young George A Smith and Orson  Pratt.    The forepart of the next day was occupied by Parley P.  Pratt ^and^ Lorenzo Snow and in the afternoon Wilford Woodruff delivered  and address upon the Deseret Agricultural and Manufacturing   Society. The authorities were presented and sustained and    Wilford Woodruff appointed Assistant Historian.  ^April the 7th 1856^ 
 1857    General Conference  of   The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints  held in the Bowery G. S. L. City   April the 6th 1857    Conference commenced at 10 o'clock. President Young made some   remarks concerning sending missionaries abroad and said he would send   many to the States if he could get those of the right stripe. He said there   was a great difference in men preaching and spoke of brother Clapp in   Texas and the Twelve in London.    The statistical account at the financial affairs of the   Church was read.    In the afternoon D. H. Wells H. C Kimball followed   by President Brigham ^Young^ who delivered an interesting discourse upon practical   economy    The ^conference^ continued through the next day and the evening in the   Social Hall I addressed the missionaries and was followed by Orson   Hyde Lorenzo Snow F. D. Richards and Joseph Young and others.    The following ^day^ we had an immense congregation and   a good time. The conference this day was addressed by Brigham Young   Heber C Kimball Daniel H Wells Orson Hyde Wilford Woodruff Lorenzo Snow   and F. D. Richards and others    Among other things President Young said that babes and   children gazed upon angels a great deal and they ^were^ innocent before God and   when they were brought up properly they would always be holy men and women   before the Lord.    The President also exhorted the people to sentt out fruit trees   and at the close of the meeting I let the brethren have about 300 peech trees    The Conference continued till over the 9th when   it closed to meet again on the 6th of October 
 live and 4 of the Col. staff and they had 23 baggage waggons.    They stoped a short time in front of the Governor's  Office and then continued their march towards the mountains of snow as  nearly 2000 of their brethren had done before. Many went with  wet feet poor boots and straw hats on and without tents or fire for that  night as they could not reach timber until the next day. This showed  the willingness of the Saints to maintain the Kingdom of God and  defend themselves against our enemies    On the 26th Ben Simons a Cherokee called  into President Young's office. He had been two days in the camp  of the enemy. He said they wanted salt very much. Their cattle  were dying very fast and they were cutting timber and digging holes  in the earth which looked like going into Winter Quarters. The merchants  were suffering for want of food and they deserved it for they had been  the means in a great measure in bringing on the war.    Next day President Young sent    A Load of Salt as a Present to the U.S. Army  with a letter to Col Johnson. The President read us the  letter which was rich and interesting    Arrival of Governor Cummings and Others in the U.S. Camp.    An express came in on the 287th in the night saying that Governor  Cummings & Lieut. Col. Philip St. George Cook 2nd Dragoons the  Ex-commander of the Mormon Battalion in Mexico had arrived with  other officers on Saturday and Sunday last with about 300 dragoons  They had canvassed over the walls of Fort Bridger and the Corell  but their operations looked like temporary work and not like Winter  Quarters for the whole army. It was still thought that they  might attempt to come in.    Sunday morning the 29th George A  Smith and myself was called upon to go to Governor Young's 
 On the second day of the Conference the Twelve  met at 5 o'clock P.M. and blessed and set apart 88 missionaries  and during the Conference they blessed and set apart 255 persons    Wilford Woodruff in company with others  of the Twelve ordained to the office of the Seventies Wilford  Woodruff Brandon and blessed him. He was named  after me was 18 years of age; and I baptized his father ^and  mother^ twenty two years before in Tennessee. His father had  been dead several years. I took him home gave him  a dollar and good counsel and let him go his way.    The Conference at the end of the 3rd  day adjourned till October the 6th.    Among the number of missionaries called  during the Conference wasere Orson Pratt and E. T. Benson  to England to preside over the European mission George  A. Smith on a political mission to Washington and  Erastus Snow to the States upon the business specially of  the emigration of the Saints. Elder Lorenzo Snow  not to go to England as first designed and previously named    Incidents in the Time of our Famine    J. M Grant on the Sunday afternoon spoke of Golighty's  shop being broken open and 150 lbs of flour taken from it  and that Wilford Woodruff lost 35 lbs from his buckery.    Wilford Woodruff followed and said that  those who took his flour if they took it because they were  suffering with hunger and would ask a blessing upon the bread  when it was made and send him home the bags he would  not bring an accusation against them. At the close  of the meeting the bags were put in sight and brought  me next morning.    I met in the prayer circle in the 
 During Conference a number of missionaries were called   and on the 22nd I spent the day in the Council House blessing the missionaries   Dur On this and the preceding day we blessed 114 missionaries bound to   various parts of the earth. Ten were bound for the United States   13 to the Sandwich Ilands 2 to California 23 to England and Europe   22 to Canada 2 to the Cape of Good Hope. (The two to California   were to take charge of the office of the Western Standard.) One missionary   was sent to ^South^ Africa 1 to Denmark 1 to Switzerland 2 to Italy and   19 to the Express Company    The Hand Cart Missionaries Start  April 23rd 1857    The missionaries met at Temple Block and a vast number of   the people assembled and they ^were^ addressed by Orson Hyde Lorenzo ^Snow^   Wilford Woodruff J. Clinton and Joseph Young. President Young   came into the crowd and told the people to go home about their business   and for the missionaries to start upon their journey. So all the Elders   had their handcarts fitted up and started out. There was 25 hand-carts   and from two to three men to each cart and many two horse teams   loaded with flour to supply the Stations for the carrying company   The Presidency and Twelve with hundreds of people went up to the   Bench and the^re^ organized and returned.    On the 25 of May my daughter Phebe had   a very severe attack of inflamation on the lungs or something like the   plurisy and could not breathe only with great difficulty. We bolstered   her up in bed and she would catch for breath like a person straugling  We annointed ^her^ laid hands upon her and rebuked the desease. I finally   got Joseph Smith's hankerchief which he gave me in 1839 and said   it should remain as a league betwen us as long as I would keep it. I   laid the handkerchief and she became somewhat better and slept    Arrival Of George A. Smith and Others 
 evening and the following named persons received their blessings and  where [were] set apart for their missions: Elders Orson Pratt George A Smith  Ezra T. Benson Erastus Snow Truman O. Angel and Phineas Young  Wilford Woodruff wrote them all from memory three days afterwards  and had them copied into the Historian's Book of Events. George  A. Smith's blessing was written at his dictation by T. Bullock; but  the remainder Wilford Woodruff wrote.    On the 15th I met with President Young at his office  with George A. Smith and Thomas Bullock and read Church History  to him. I was getting initiated into my office as Assistant Church  Historian to take charge of the Historian's office and business in  the absence of George A. Smith    In reading the revelation upon Patriarchal marriage  and while upon the paragraph relating to the sheding of innocent blood  President Young remarked that it was a very nice point to distinguish  between i^n^nocent blood and that which is not innocent. Were we now  commanded to go and avenge the blood of the Prophets where it would  reach infants from the cradle to the third and fourth generation  should we know what to do in such case? We should not. But  there is one thing that is a consolation to me and that is that I am  satisfied that the Lord will not require it of this people until they  become sanctified and are led by the Spirit of God so as not to  shed innocent blood    Again what does the saying mean that all  shall be damned who do not keep this law unto whom it is  revealled? Does it mean that they shall take more wives than  one? I think that it includes the whole law with its  covenants. I think that many who come into this world will  be damned or disorganized and I think that this is the ^second^ death  which is referred to that ^as^ the broad road leads to ^death^ while few will  enter through the straight gate into the fulness of eternal life    President Young had brother Cannon take    [sideways text] ^revise diction^ [end of sideways text] 
 Office as an express had arrived from the enemy bringing    A Proclamation From A. Cumming^s^ as Governor of Utah.    We found Brother Brigham Young and Carrington at the Office; and soon  Heber C. Kimball, A. O. Smoot Lorenzo Young and others came. Brother  Carrington read the Proclamation in which A Cummings called himself  Governor of Utah and said that the President of the United States appointed  him Governor of Utah. He commanded all thearmed people to disperse  to their homes and said all that opposed them would be treated as traitors  He also wrote a letter to Governor Young accusing him of treason and  said that he should establish his quarters in Green River County and  organize a temporary government and that all would be tried for treason  who opposed them.    We went to the Tabernacle and after the Preaching Brother  Carrington read the Proclamation and the letters    Disbanding and Return of our Troops from the Mountains    On the 2nd of December early in the morning  the troops began to arrive having been dismissed by General Wells  and they continued to pour into the city until a late hour of the day.  Brother Southworth who had been a prisoner related to me his capture  &c. He said among the rest that when he came up with Howard  Livingston the principal merchant of G. S. L. City he asked him to intercede  with Johnston to let him go asto his family as they had nothing against  him only that he was a Mormon but Livingston would do nothing  for him.    He reported that there was much of the spirit of desertion  in the camp and that the officers treated their soldiers in a cruel manner  and that many would desert if they could. He said that the  greatest amount of any one article in the camp was ardent spirits  He thought there were 100 waggon loads of it. Howard Livingston 
 On the 29th the Eastern Mail arrived bringing George A Smith   J. M. Bernhisel ^and Truman O Angel^    On Sunday in the Prayer Circle letters were ^read^ touching Utah affairs in   the States. We found that all hell was boiling over against us. Among the   rest Wm Smith called upon the Government to furnish him with an army and   money and he would come to Utah and subdue the Mormons    In conversation in the Historian's Office on the 2nd of June  between President Young George A Smith Joseph Young and myself the President  said    There is no law in heaven or earth that would compel a woman to stay   with a man either in time or eternity. This I think is true but I do not   know. If a man who is a High Priest takes a woman and she leaves him   and goes to one of a lower office say the lesser Priesthood or members, I think   in the resurrection that that High Priest can claim her    Joseph Young: What if she should not want to go with him? I   should not want a woman under those circumstances    Brigham: I will tell you what you will find that all these  evil traditions and affections or passions that haunt the mind in this life will   all be done away in the resurrection. You will find then that any   man who gets a glory and exaltation will be so beautiful that any woman   would be willing to have him if it was right and whenever it is right   for the woman to go there she will be willing to go for all those evils   will vanish to which we are subject in this life. I have told the truth   just as it is but others will at times will get up and tell the people that   they will have no heaven only what they make in this life and that it   will be in the next world as it will be this. Now they do not mean   what they say. They do not explain themselves and hence the people   do not understand    Joseph Young said, "I wish I knew what my limits are"   and the President replied    "Your limits are endless and you have not go half   way to the end of it yet. Now when I was an Elder I was as 
 a daguarreaotype of the temple draft for Truman O Angel to take  with him to England. President Young wrote the words to be  put upon one of the stones of the Temple:    "Holliness to the Lord. The Temple of our God  built by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints commenced  on the 6th day of April A.D. 1853    On the next day I met again with President Young  and George A Smith and Thomas Bullock read manuscript of the  Church History up to Joseph and Hyrum's martyrdom in jail. It  brought fresh to mind the scenes of those sorrowful days.    This was the last day George A Smith  spent with President Young reading History before starting to  Washington as a Delegate from the Deseret State Convention  We dined with President Young. I paid 75 dollars in cash  as a donation to the poor fund into the hands of brother McIntosh    On the 18th in the Historian's Office George   A Smith and myself laid our hands upon the head of Samuel  Harrison Baliley Smith the son of Samuel Smith one of the  "Witnesses to the Book of Mormon" and ordained him one of the  Seventies and set him apart to go on mission to ^England^  George A Smith was mouth.    About this time Parley Pratt was very  sick. On the 17th Oson his brother myself and George A  Smith laid hands upon him. He had been insensible for two  days. On Sunday the 20th J. M. Grant Bishop Hoagland  Joseph Horn and myself laid hands upon him again and as his  family was out of bread we 4 gave each 50 lbs of flour making  200 lbs.    I met with the Presidency and Twelve on this  Sunday in Prayer Circle. After prayers President Young  asked those who were going away on missions if they  were satisfied with him and felt satisfied that he was 
 had an outfit of liquor which amounted to $10,00[0] first cost; and all  the army had a great amount of liquor as well as all the Suttlers  The officers were drunk every day    He also said that there was a division of the  officers as well as the soldiers. A portion of them think that  Governor Young is justified in taking the course he does in his own  defence. Their animals were dying so fast that they all  expected to be on foot before next Spring. They had sent Captain   Marcy to Texas to buy mules horses and oxen.    Summary of the Season's Expedition    The Expedition of the Season was now entirely  closed. We had clearly seen the hand of God made visible in  our behalf. An army had been sent by the United States to  make war for the sole purpose to destroy the Church of Jesus Christ  of Latter-day Saints. The Kingdom of God had been driven  from the confines of the United States into the Rocky Mountains  then Mexican territory with the hope of the nation that we should  perish but as soon as they found that we should live and prosper  they became alarmed and resolved upon our destruction and now  the United States had sent their armies out to accomplish their  hellish purpose.    As soon as this was known unto us theour leader  of the Church and Kingdom of God rose up in the strength of Israel's  God and proclaimed Israel free. His counsellors Heber C Kimball  and Daniel H Well with the Twelve Apostles sustained him and all  the people said, Amen.    He testified unto the people in the name of  God that if they would be united with him in their faith prayers and  works the enemy should not have power to come into our  Valley; that the Lord would hedge up their way and we should 
 willing to correct an Eerror in the brethren and I am now; but the people   do not see it so. Now if you should be with the Twelve or anybody   you would have a right to correct an error as well as with a member but   you could not correct them by cutting them off from the Church because they   are over you in the Priesthood    Prophecies of Joseph and Brigham   upon   William Smith    On Sunday the 14 of June in the Prayer circle the subject of   William Smith was brought up. It was said that Joseph Smith   prophesied that his brother William would become a good man when  he became an old man. Some of the brethren present at our prayer   circle thought he said if he ever did become good it would be when he was  an old man.    President Young then said whether Joseph said it or not   I will say in the name of the Lord that if William Smith lives till he is   65 or 70 he will become a good humble man; he will do the best he can   He will have to answer for his sins. Write this brother Woodruff  and put it into the Church History. When a man gives way to the   power of the devil he finds it hard to recover himself.    The Female Relief Society    On the 17th they met at my house. There were about 50 present  sewing knitting sewing carpet rags making quilts &c. It is a laudable  undertaking. All the females in the Ward met at my house   each Wednesday afternoon. They open and close with prayer Mrs   Phebe Wo Woodruff was President and Mrs Pratt secretary. They clothed  all the poor in the Ward and during the last quarter the^y^ made a   donation to the Perpetual Emigration Fund of 126 dollars.    We finished reading Samuel Smith's ^history^ on the   16th and found in the office the histories of David Patten Samuel 
 keeping up with the Spirit of the times? They all said they were  and asked him if he was satisfied with them. He said he was. The  President advised Elder George A Smith not to indulge in arguing  any point question or principle which he did not believe for the sake  of argument or to draw something out of others as it was a dangerous  ground. George A. thanked him for his advise and promised  to follow it. Brother Smith also spoke in plainness his feelings  concerning some of the principles of Elder Orson Pratt wherein he  differed from ^the^ President concerning the creation of Adam out of the   dust of the earth and the final consummation of knowledge  and many other things. Orson Pratt promised he would not publish anything in opposition  to President Young's views    On the Monday the Historian's Office was crowded  with clerks taking a copy of the census: 291 was the highest number  at any one time    The missionaries left the city on the morning of  the 22nd and met at the mouth of the Kanyon. I took my family  in a carriage and drove there to visit them and take minutes of their  organization. President Young arrived at half past 10 o'clock  and organized the company by appointing A. O. Smoot captain  William Miller captain of the guard Elder Benson Chaplain  and James Ure clerk. He gave them some instruction  concerning their journey and also gave them his parting blessing  Brother J. V. Long reported his speech and Wilford Woodruff took  a list of the names of those going East on mission and found them  to be 36 in number. Professor Orson Pratt was going to Liverpool   to take the place of Franklin D. Richards. He was accompanied  by Elder E. T. Benson also of the Twelve Apostles and other missionaries  to England. The Hon. George A Smith was going to Washington  as a delegate from our State Convention to urge in connection   with the Hon. John Taylor the claims of Utah to be numbered  with the States. Elder Erastus Snow of the Twelve was going  to St Louis to preside and publish the Luminary and Marshal 
 not be called to shed their blood neither should they have power to shed ours. This  President Young had taught from day to day when there was every prospect  that the enemy would try to come.    From 2 to 3 thousand of the brethren had armed  themselves and went into the Mountains according to the counsel of President  Young and they were led by their valient General Daniel H. Wells to hedge  up the way of the enemy should they attempt to come in. Our brethren  had made large entrenchments and ditches and piled up large masses  of rocks in narrow passes so as to roll them down upon the enemy  and destroy them should they attempt to come in. But as the  Prophets Brigham and Heber had said so it came to pass. The Lord  fought our battles and hedged up the way of our enemies. When  they got to Ham's Fork 150 miles from our city the storms and cold  killed their horses mules and cattle by hundreds so that when  the whole army got together with the Governor and Judges whom the  Government had sent to rule and tyranize over us they had  not enough teams left to daraw one third of their trains so they  were oblidgged to stop and spend the Winter in the storms of the  Mountains and their wisdom seems taken from them    Our brethren had been enabled to head them  like a herd of cattle and they had shot grape and musket and  minnie [minié] balls at them from time to time and those balls had  flown like hail around the servants of God but not a drop of  their blood had been shed neither had the brethren returned the fire  upon the enemy even as much as in one instance. Fear had  so taken hold upon them that they would flee into their main  body at the approach of a small number of our brethren and the  Lord had frustrated the enemy in all their designs against us up  to this day.    Through all this President Young had been as calmn  as a Summer's day and the army of Zion was now returning to  their homes with the same spirit of composure and quietude as 
 Heywood and others wher on an official trip to Washington    I returned to the city and found the clerks  busy making out the papers for the Hon. George A Smith. I   stoped till midnight in the Office and most of the clerks remained  all night making out the census papers which was forwarded the  next morning to George A Smith express by John Sharp.    Another Attempt of the Destroyer on My Life.    I have been marked as a victem for the attacks of the Destroyer  from my infancy up to the present time. I have faced accidents  misfortunes and apparently death so many times that it had become  a proverb with me to say that there has seemed to be two powers  constantly watching me and at work with me one to kill and  the other to save me. Thus far the power to save me  and preserve my life had prevailed. How long I should be blessed  with this preserving power and care time must determine    I had never until now been called  upon to war with poison and mortification in my system. But  such was now the case. I extract the following verbatum  from my daily Journal written at the time    "26th: I am unwell this morning. I am  breaking out all over my body. My family think it is  the measels but I had the measels when I was a boy. During  the evening I broke out all over something resembling the "hives"  I just begin to understand what it is that is making me sick  I had an ox die on the 21st. It was supposed that he died with  poison. He was mortified. While assisting in skinning him  I scratched my hwrist sufficient to innoculate myself with the  poison which is now beginning to work.    Sunday the 27th I was quite unwell  and did not attend meeting. The cut upon my wrist began

We were glad to get these Journals    The Constitution of the Kingdom    I^n^ a great discourse delivered by President Young on Sunday the 21st he   said among many other important items, "The Constitution of the United  States was got up by inspiration. It gives all men the rights of conscience   So it will be in the Millennium. It will be like the Constitution. All   will have to bow the knee and acknowledge the Lord that it is his right  to reign but they must not blaspheme; but they may enjoy their own religion    Men talk about making a law to stop Polygamy   in Utah that would be an expose facto law and the Constitution declairs   that Congress shall make no such law and if the time comes when the   United States do make a law and send men to punish me for Polygamy   or having more than one wife as there is no law against it you may   make up your mind that I shall send them to hell. I do not   think they will do it but if they do you may tell them they had   better send 100,000 men with provisions for five years and they   may make their calculations upon it they will want to make forts   from one end of the route to the other so that they can step from one   to the other. There is a sweeping clause against this proceding. When   they charter a ship company to build ships and control them they cede   up their right in the case. So it is in the Territories. They have   a Territorial Government. This people should have the right to   govern their own institutions    News of the Murder of Parley P. Pratt.

It was the shortest trip ever made up to this date    The mail brought the sad news of the murder 
 to gather poison and turn black    28th I became satisfied on Monday that I had this enemy poison  and mortification to meet and that to in the worse form. There is but  a small chance for a man to live who is innoculated with poison and  mortification by dissecting the body of either man or beast. It is much  worse than drinking poison or being bit by poisonous serpants for  it is in a much more deadly form. Several have died this Spring  by skining cattle which have died. All should be more cautious  than what I have been in this matter, and not run the risk of loosing  their lives to save the skins of animals who die of disease. The  following account will show the opperation of this disease with  me from day to day and how near I came loosing my life: in  fact I was only saved through the power and mercy of God    This morning the affected spot upon my  wrist had grown to about the size of a dime and had risen above  the arm and main ^flesh^ about half an inch and turned black   as ink. My arm began to swell and pain me and  I felt the poison and mortification working through my system  I called upon President Young and showed him my arm and asked  his advice and he counselled me to go to immediately and clense  my stomach and bowels and poultice my arm with onions  earth or anything that would draw it from my system  He also advised me to show it to Dr Sprague. I did so  and he in addition to what President Young had recommended  dug me up some dock ^elecampane^ blazing star roots, and advised  me to make a tea of it also to make a poultice of it and  put in on my arm. I went immediately home and put these  things into execution for I saw that I had a strong warefare in  order to save my life    29th: This was a trying day in my life. The  poison had so circulated through my system that it was afflicting  my whole body seriously. I became so weak that I could not stand

All  the Saints in Calaifornia were returning home and Elder George  Q Cannon had got out half a sheet of the "Standard" and there  was quite an excitement concerning the Mormon question.    Near Escape of One of our Scouting Parties.    General Wells related that brother Maxwell had  command of a small scouting company. They took a horse from  the enemy and was fired at by them but no one was hurt. They  went back to their encampment. Brother Maxwell became  strongly impressed that there was danger in their way and that  they ought to leave their camp. He told his brethren this but  some of them did not think so and all went to bed. But these  feelings increased upon brother Maxwell and he arose from his  bed and told his brethren he was going to leave that place immediately  and they all gathered up their horses and went several miles back  and camped for the night and soon the encampment which they  had just left was surrounded by a hundred men and had it not  have been for this warning they probably would have been all taken  prisoners    The Legislature.

 upon my feet. It took two persons to lead me from the fire  to my bed. I could not talk no more than if I had been  drunk; my stomach and bowels ceased to act and judging  from outward appearence it seemed as though I should not live  twenty four hours. My wife and friends laboured  with me throughout the day faithfully and with emetics and  injections and with raw onion poultices upon my arm I  got my whole system in opperation before night. President  Young in company with Dr Sprague called upon me at about  evening. I was better than I had been through the day  Brothers Young and Sprague laid hands upon me and blessed  me. The following is a synopsis of the blessing which the  President pronounced upon my head which I wrote from  memory after my recovery:    "Brother Wilford; in the name of  Jesus Christ and by virtue of the Holy Priesthood I lay my  hands upon your head to bless you; and I ask my Father  in Heaven to stay the disease which is resting upon you  and to cleanse your blood and to heal you: and I  say in the name of Jesus Christ that you shall not die  but shall live to finish your work which is appointed you  to do upon the earth. The adversary has sought many  times to destroy your life from the earth but the Lord  has preserved you and will preserve you until your work  is done. I feel to say that all is right here. I feel  to ask the Lord to bless all the means you make use of  for your recovery. You shall be healed up from this  disease and live to enjoy the society of your family and  your children shall grow up around you and you shall  be a blessing to them. Let your heart be comforted;  all shall be well with you: and I seal these blessings  upon you in the name of Jesus Christ: Amen. 
 On the 14th of December the Legilslature of the Territory  of Utah met at the Social Hall at 10 o'clock. Both Houses met and organized  in about 30 minutes and adjourned till the morrow    Presenting The Message of Governor Young  Dec. 15th 1857    Both Houses were in Joint Session and Governor Young appeared at  12 minutes to eleven o'clock and made a few remarks and then presented  his Message to the Assembly which was read by the chief clerk of the  House James Ferguson. It was the most august document I ever heard    Ben Simmons arrived in the city the next day  and called upon President Young with D. Huntington. He said  there was    Divison of Parties in the Army    One party was the military and the other was called fFrememen. There  was a fight among them and 7 men killed.  Johnson sent  the military to quell the mob and Governor Cumming told  them to go back that when he wanted them he would call for  them.    The Superintendant of Indian affairs said he had a million  of gold to give the Indians of this Territory.    One man gathered up one bag of salt that our men had  thrown away which was sent by Governor Young but rejected by Col  Johnson. The man sold it to the merchants for $20 and they sold  it to the soldiers for 2 or 13 dollars per lb. Ben Simmons took out  900 lbs of salt and sold it for $2.50 ^100^ cts per lb making $2250 and $1  per lb for service berries.    Livingston said he would give $500 for the privilege  of coming into the city if he did not stop but one day. McGraw  was the worse man in the army and he had the most to say against 
 for him to fill his mission. President Young said yes it was but I am willing   to forgive him and that he may be baptized and confirmed. Then let him come  here.    Brother Brigham said if we live our religion we shall have all   the world upon us. I will tell you the time has come when the Elders   have got to take care of themse[lves] for the people will publish a lie and they   will shoot them if they are not careful    The people must know that there is a God in heaven and   circoumstances will bring this thing to bear. I am fe^e^ble but I hope I shall   yet live to preach in Jackson County ^St Louis^ Cincinnati New York and through   the Eastern States    I had a dream. I thought I saw my family picking   all kinds of flowers and fruit. I thought I went East to preach and I   saw that the people in the Valley had dug down the mountain or cut it   down square and brought the soil out of the mountain and made some   good gardens. I went on East and I heard a Methodist Priest pray for   sinners. A man followed me and asked me if I wanted some   brass. I told him no. They wanted me to steal something  I told them I would not do it. It was moles ^moulds^ to make coin in   that they wanted me to steal. I saw ^stolen^ goods in great piles and stacks   that the people in the Eastern States had stolen; and some tried to   raise a mob upon me but I did not fear them. Soon I saw some   brethren. I saw one apostate. He wanted to kill me. I told him   if he did not behave himself I would send him to hell. I again   saw the brethren cut down the mountain and make good farms   I thought these were good times."    The above is President Young's dream. The   President said if President Young the Lord our God does not visit the   United States then I am no Prophet and we shall find that all good   men will come to the mountains for safety    President Young Heber C Kimball George A   Smith Amasa Lyman and Charles C. Rich on the 25 came into 
 30th. I spent a sick day. I poulticed my arm. It  continued to swell to a great degree and as the poison was drawn into  it from my system it inflamed and mortified and looked as though my  whole body would soon be mortified. I continued to poultice my  arm with raw onions earth and powdered roots which drew the impurities  of my body into it. The poison that was ^ran^ out of my arm would  blister my flesh like a hot iron wherever it touched and the flesh  would turn black and dead. As the onion and earth poultices  were not strong enough to draw the poison and mortification out  sufficiently I pounded up some charcoal fine and made it wet  with the juice of wormwood ragwood^weed^ and wild sage and put it on  my arm as a poultice and it began to take the mortification  poison and swelling out of it. I was very sick and having a  hard warefare between life and death but President Young promised  me that I should live and I act in faith upon that promise in  all that I do. I feel that I shall live and not die    May 1st. This was also an exceeding sick day  I took a course of medicine to clense my system and continued  the charcoal poultices on my arm which had a good effect    2nd. I felt some better to day yet very sick  but I was enabled to sit up a little. I was quite excited in  the evening. Wilford and Moroni was ploughing in the  big field four miles from home and at about 4 o'clock in the  afternoon one of the horses came home upon a run with a part of  the harness on. We did not know but the boys were killed  until we sent a man down into the field with the horse. He  found the boys not hurt. The horses had run away with  the plough. In jumping over the bars they left the plough  sticking into the post with the doubletrees. They broke the  whippletrees and harness to peaces but I felt thankful the boys  escaped unhurt. One was my own son and the other my  Indian boy. 
 us    There ^were^ 500 men who had left for the States several of whom had been frozen  to death. John Biglar a great gambler took out of the army in a day  by gambling $25,000 and carried it off in a buck shot sack    Ben Simons wanted to continue the trade with  the army and wished another Cherokee to have a pass to go with him.  President Young asked him if he had not made money enough. He said  he wanted to make all he could. President Young told him that  he must not take the enemy anything to eat. He might salt [sell] them  salt and fire but nothing to eat.    They said there were potatoes and turnips at Fort  Supply a plenty but Governor GCummings would not let them have them    President Young said he felt some of the time like  giving them hell. If they had the power they would make this city  a perfect Bedlam and they would corrupt the people as fast  as they could    To   Elder Wilford Woodruff,  By Eliza R. Snow.    With true respect, and as a tribute due,  To friendship, brother Woodruf unto you,  As one more blessed than most your fellow men,  I now address the effusion of my pen.    You were appointed, ere your mortal birth,  To an Apostleship upon the earth;  The Lord our God has had his eye on thee,  With watchful care from earliest infancy. 
 the Historian's Office and sat and conversed upon a variety of subjects.   The President said that David Patten and T B. Marsh came to Kirtland  in the fall of 1837. As soon as they came I got Marsh to go to Joseph   but Patten would go to Warren Parrish. He got his mind prejudiced and   when he went to see Joseph David insulted Joseph; and Joseph slap^ped^   him in the face and kicked him out of the yard. This did David   good.    I could not sleep in those days. I spent many a night, all night   without sleeping at all. I prayed a good deal and my mind was   constantly active.    Brother Charles C Rich gave an account of the the death of   David W. Patten. He said as we charged upon the mob two men   remained behind the bank. Patten took after one of them and   I the other and the man that Patten took after turned round and   shot him and he fell to the ground only but a few steps from me    In the prayer circle on Sunday the 28th   President Young spoke of Strang and his death and so did J. M.  Bernhisal who thought that George Miller was also dead. George   A Smith said that he was informed that Miller had gathered   the followers of Strang about 60 in munber [number]. President Young   said they made a business of stealing but let men come here   and they would see that we had shown the works of industry    Phelps said the man in Clay County   Court House who said he would kill Jo. Smith and if the Turkey   buzzards did not eat out his eyes they should eat out his own (Phelps   stood within a few feet of him) while going home the boat sunk and   he was drowned and he floated upon some floodwood and the buzzards  eat out his eyes and flesh. Phelps saw his body after this and a   man said he had fulfilled his own prophesy    Orson Hyde told of a man who was one   of the first settlers of Ma^issouri^ who helped to drive out the Saints   and it had since troubled him so much that he had sold out and 
 I continued very sick during the next four days ^week^  The charcoal poultices were constantly applied with much effect and  another course of medicine taken and I suffered much from the  Lobelia in my stomach. A good deal of dead flesh had  gathered in my arm. Dr. Sprague cut out a portion of it with  a penknife but did not get it all out.    The Eastern Mail came in on the 9th  and brought most of the mail since last November. Many  thousands of letters were received in the city    Correspondance From the Chief Gardener of Queen Victoria    Among the rest was a letter from the Chief Gardener of her  Majesty Queen Victoria who wished to open correspondence  with the Horticultural Society of this Valley and make an  exchange of seeds &c.    On Sunday the 11th in the evening I  attended Prayer circle and sat 2 hours and heard letters  read from correspondents in New York Washington Liverpool  London and various parts of the earth    I found that I could not get rid of the  dead flesh in my ^arm^ without using something to eat it out;   so on the 12th I took 20 grains of lunar costic or nitred of  silver and disolved it in two tablespoons of water and washed  the edges where the dead and living flesh met and it began  slowly to seperate    I was feeling a little better the next day  but still very weak and feeble. The dead flesh was parting in my  arm.    Next day I was able to walk to the Historian's  Office; and at 1 o'clock in the morning I was called upon to  administer to Sister Orson Pratt. I promised her that 
 You was preserved, midst Bablyonish night,  From Atheistic and sectarian blight;  From manly rectitude you did not swerve;  The Priests of Baal you never stooped to serve.    From heavenly courts, the light that's shining now,  Shone on your path, and mantled o'er your brow;  Eternal visions opened to your view;  You loved the truth and found salvation too.    You then with joy the Gospel banner bore,  To distant lands and on your native shore;  In truths defence most valiently you stood,  And cleared your garments of the Gentiles' blood.    One of the chosen Twelve, who're called to stand,  To turn the Gospel key for ev'ry land;  Your name in honour, as a faithful one,  To future generations will be known.    With heart inspired, rich matter to indite,  In Zion now your business is to wrigte;  With skill, you wield the ready writer's pen,  'Tis yours to immortalize the deeds of men.    Full many a righteous act and gifted word,  By Saints performed, from lips of Prophets heard,  Had slip'd the mem'ries of judious men,  But for the promptings of your faithful pen. 
 left the place    President Young asked Wm W. Phelps if astrology was true and Phelps  said "I don't know." President Young observed Brother Woodruff write that down   This is the first thing I ever heard of but what brother Phelps knew. He says   he dont know anything about astrology. But I believe it is true. So is   mesmerism or there is true principle in it    On Sunday the 29th in his remarks Wilford Woodruff  said he had faith in the doctrine taught by President Young for the rising   generation to go in foot instead of on horse back. He said "I know   the good of it by experience. I travelled 1200 miles in one of my   journies on foot and averaged 40 miles a day; then waded the   Missipp^ssippi^ swamp from Little Rock, Ark. to Mamphis Tennesee   200 miles and only 16 miles out of water. One day I walked 60 miles   and while on journey walked 72 miles without eating and when I got   to Eagle C^reek^ with Parrish I beleive I could have beaten ^killed^ any horse I   ever saw, walking to have followed it"    There is another thing I wish to speak of. We know   how things have been in Nauvoo. Joseph and Hyrum the leaders of   the people were killed. If the time ever comes again when the   leaders of this people are called for I am opposed to their being given   up. I do not care what the consequences are for if any have   got to die let if be some of the rest of us who are not of as much   consequence as they are but I want them to live to lead Israel   as long as there is anybody to lead. Let us obey counsel in all   things and if necessary go into the mountains and we will increase  until the wicked will say let us not go against Zion to battle for   her sons are terrible and we cannot stand."    Indipendance Day    The inhabitants of the city celebrated the day by a splendid   military performance. The legion met on the public square 
 both she and her child should do well and in about fifteen minutes she  had a daughter born that weighed 12 lbs, both mother and child doing  well    On the following day I got all the dead flesh out of my  arm so that it was now fast healing up    Wilford Nearly Killed    I had another shock of excitement to day. Wilford took the horses  to carry posts and poles to my pasture with the running gears  While coming home my new horse started suddenly into a run  Wilford could not hold them. They ran three blocks with him  and in turning the corner they turned the hind wheels three times  over with Wilford setting upon the exeltree. The horses continued  to run with the forewheels until they ran against the fence. My   son was stunned and picked up for dead but he soon came to  and finally led one of the horses home and a man rode home  the other. Wilford was hurt in one leg and badly jarred in  the head but he had a comfortable night's rest and I felt  thankful that he was not killed    Sunday the 18th was the first time I attended  meeting in the Tabernacle since the attack upon my life by poison and  mortification    On the 30th I read to President Young the letter that  the Horticultural Society had received from Sir William Jackson  Hooper Director of the Royal Gardens Kensington London. The  day previous to this in the Historian's Office I wrote a letter to him  in answer to his requesting us to open correspondence with him    President Young Fifty Five Years of ^age^ on the 1st of June 1856    The President's birthday this year came on a Sunday.

 The Church Historian's labours to devide,  As his Assistant, coupled side by side,  You write for Zion, where her histry's known;  Inscribing her's, perpetuates your own.    Faithful to God, and to your brethren true,  Integrity has twined a wreath for you,  Of never fading laurels, which will be,  A glorious coronet eternally,    In that blessed world, where light and knowledge dwell,  Your blessedness no earthly tongue can tell,  Where heaven's effulgence will your head surround,  And you with everlasting glory crowned.    Filled with immortal majesty and might,  Associated with the Gods in light,  With gifts and powers of endless lives, you'll be  Progressing on and on eternally.    G. S. L. City, November 23rd 1857    On the 18th of December George A. Smith and myself  called upon President Brigham Young to ask him concerning Joseph's  teachings upon the endowments; and how much we were to make a subject  of public history. President Young told us Joseph's instructions to him  concerning the 2nd Anointing and other Temple matters. See my  private manuscript Journals date Dec 18th 1857    On Monday the 21st of Dec I met with the  Legislative Council: most of the time we were in Joint Sessions. 
 more than ever I saw out together before in this city. We were dismissed   before the Governor's residence at 12 o'clock    A Great Picknick Party   24th of July    I took my family in my waggon and started for the mouth   of the Big Cottonwood Kanyon on the 22nd of July   to attend the great Picknick party of President Young and company   at the head waters of the Big Cottonwood to celebrate the 24^th^ of July   in commemoration of the enetry of the Pioneers into the Valley of the   Great Salt Lake. On the first night we camped in the Big Cottonwood   where the brethren were cutting Granite for the Temple. Brother   Rich and George A Smith Amasa Lyman and many others camped   with me. The whole road was lined with waggons for miles  and they camped wherever they could drive out of the road.    We arose next morning before 3 o'clock   and started on our road. The Twelve followed the Presidency   and the guards. The string of waggons reached for many   miles. We arrived at the Campground at about 132 o'clock  and the last waggon did not arrive till near midnight. The   whole company munbered [numbered] 2587 persons with 468 carriages and   waggons; 1028 horses and mules 332 oxen and cows. Flags   were raised upon the highest peacks that surrounded us and   the stars and stripes were placed upon the highest trees. The   surrounding scenes of mountains valleys lakes woods and medows   made the sight the most interesting I ever beheld. We had   prayers at night and an address from President Young. There   were five bands of music in attendance.    On the 24th in keeping up the aniversary   of the enterance of the Pioneers into the valleys we had music   singing prayers addresses and each one enjoyed himself the best   he could. Many trout were caught in the Lake. The 
 in the Bowery. Leonard I Smith returned missionary  from South Africa preached in the morning and was followed  by brother Kimball    In the afternoon President Young wished all the  able bodied men to go immediately to work and finish the canal  to bring Big Cottonwood Creek to water the five acre lots  He requested all the Bishops to stand up and all the men  of the Wards who could go and dig on it. 333 names were  obtained. The 14th Ward gave the most names. They  obtained at their evening's meeting 45 names.    President Young's Dream of the War.    At our prayer circle in the evening the subject of the  Kansas question was spoken of. Wilford Woodruff  asked President Young if he remembered the dream that  he had several years ago and President Young said  he did not recolect it. The following is the substance   of his dream.    He dreamt that he saw two armies meet  one came from the South and the other from the East ^North^ and  they met and fought and as fast as they were killed they   continued to have new recruits from the East and South.  I testify that I heard President Young relate this dream  several ^some^ years before this ^at Nauvoo^ but cannot state the date    On Sunday the 22nd of June President  Young preached a great discourse. Among other things he  said that the Devils were cast out of heaven to the earth and  they are still around us. Their condemnation is that   they can never have a tabernacle but they seek to get  into the tabernacles of men. All, both good and bad,  when they die remain here upon the earth the same 
 Resolutions were offered upon the merits of the Governor's Message which resolutions  were like declarations of Indipendence against wicked and ungodly men. This  drew speeches from John Taylor George A Smith Wilford Woodruff Orson Hyde  and others.    Legislative Room Burned  Dec 26 1857    Early in the morning a report came that the Social Hall was on fire  I soon went over and found the room which the Legislative Council occupied  nearly burned up and part of the chairs.    On the 31st I called upon President Young and  asked his opinion concerning a cotton company. He said the time had  come for us to act and not talk. If the people had done the same as  you and I have concerning sheep there would now have been a good supply  in this Territory. And with regard to cotton I am now going to send  men into the cotton country to make cotton for me so that I can have some  to use myself and if you or any of the brethren wish to join me you can    I looked over my Journal for the year 1857 and  made up my usual Synopsis and of the events of the year I recorded my  reflections of the day as follows    "It has been an important year to Zion and the world  1857 will be the year on history's page from which will be dated the  commencement of the downfall of the United States. For it is during this  year that they have enttered the field as open enemies and persecuters of  the Saints of the Most High God and and have sent an army of 2500 men  over 1000 miles for the purpose of laying a foundation for the destruction  of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints who have settled here in  in the Great Bason of North America, called Utah Territory or the State  of Deseret. Here in the Valleys of the Mountains is established  the kingdom of God which Daniel saw by vision and the people of  the United States are determined to destroy the Kingdom of God from  off the earth. [##Daniel 2:26-47##] But these judgements of God will now begin to rest  more fully upon that nation and will be increased upon them year by 
 whole mountains and valleys were alive with men and beast.    At 20 minutes past 9 o'clock three rounds ofwere   fired from a brass howitzer for the First Presidency of the Church. Other   rounds were also fired    Each one enjoyed himself as best he could through the day   and night. I took a walk with the Presidency to his upper mill   There were four built and one building. I never saw finer timber  in my life    At about noon Bishop A. Smoot Elders Judson Stodard   O. P. Rockwell and Judge Smith rode into camp. The two former from   the States in 20 days. They informed us that the United States  had taken away the mail contract and that a new Governor and   Judges and 2,500 troops would start for Utah soon. We went   into the President's tent and questions were asked and answered and   President Young said that if General Harney crossed the South Pass  he should send him word that he must not come into the Valley   If the Governor and officers wished to come and would behave   themselves they should be well treated. President Young felt   determined no more to submit to oppression either of individuals  towns counties states or nations    At daylight next morning the company began   to break up to return to their homes    While in the endowment house President Kimball   said he wished me to write an account of the sayings of Joseph the   Prophet when he pledged himself that he would not speak on a   certain occasion until all the 12 had spoken. So he had   to sit three quarters of a day and hear the Twelve express their   feelings and he could not say a word. He then said to the Twelve   "You have caught me this once; and now I want to give you some   advise. Never get caught as I have. Never go into a   corner unless you can see your way out in some manner."    In the Prayer Circle Sunday August the 2nd 
 as the living and are mixed up the same as the living are in a great  measure. Joseph and Hyrum and all the faithful Elders are actively  at work preaching the Gospel to the Spirits in Prison and preparing  them for the coming of Christ. The wicked spirits will gather  together against Joseph there the same as here but neither the  Devil nor the wicked have any power over him there but he  can dispaerse them at his will. Those who have shed innocent  blood or consented thereto will be angels to the Devil until they  are disorganized. Our dead children and friends are all with  us or near us. We are now in eternity as much as ever we  shall be. This great Sermon of President Young was fully  reported and published both in the Deseret News and the Journal  of Discourses.    We found a great difficulty in writing the latter  part of the History of Joseph expecially the last few days of his  life as no one had kept a Journal of the same excepting Dr  Richards now dead, and during the last days of Joseph's life  nearly all the Twelve were away on mission. This made me  very desireous to have President Youngs daily History written  so that all things might be plain to the future Historian.  The President told me that George A Smith in speaking of  the Church History in future said that it would be the History  of the Church and not of a man. I said very well; we could  not write the History of the Church without writing the History  of the Prophet and President of the Church. Brother Young  conversed freely upon the subject. I enquired of the clerks  of the President's office what they had written concerning him  daily. They read some to me and I did not think it sufficiently  full.    On the 25th Presidents Young and Kimball went  to the Island in their new boat built at Jordan Bridge. I attended  a meeting of the Agricultral Society in the Bowery. President

And this calamity will begin to come spedily upon  them and they will be visited with thunder lightning storm whirlwinds  earthquakes floods pestilence plagues war and devouring fire and the  wicked will slay the wicked until the nation is wasted away and broken  up.

 the subject came up concerning the United States sending troops to this   Territory. President Young said, "Our    Our enemies will perish in their own   corruptions. I think it will be well to send some missionaries   through the States and tell the brethren to pick up their budgets   and come to the Valley and go to England and do the same.   Let the brethren do this that go with the mail    The United States are fools to come upon   this people and so are thoese men who are bringing great quanties   of goods unto us this season. If the United States send out   troops to fight us this season we shall whip them out. Then   they will send out reinforcements and then we shall have the   Lamanites with us and the more the United States send out   the worse off they will be for they will perish with famine   I do not think anything about guns or powder for if the   United States begin war with us I intend they shall furnish  us with arms and ammunition all we want. If they do   undertake it the Lord will lead them or let them go into a   snare and their folly will be manifest    George A Smith said if you defeat   them you may look for one hundred thousand men    President Young said "It will be so   much the worse for them; but I do not think he will get   a great force here for if they get defeated this year the people   will be down on Buchannan; but I should not wonder if   we heard he was dead soon    Daniel H. Wells said this was Buchanan's   own measure some time ago"    On this same day the 2nd of August I   baptized George A. Smith J. M. Bernhisel and Truman O   Angel and confirmed them with Franklin D. Richards    I called into the President's Office on the 101th 
 Edward Hunter two Directors and some twenty five of the  Awading Committee were present including five ladies  The fruit committee examined the fruit in the gardens of   Wilford Woodruff Albert Carrington and others    J. M. Grant went North and Parley P. Pratt  returned from his journey South. He had been as far as  Washington County.    Presidents Young and Kimball returned  hom^e^ from the Island on the 28th. I had an interview  with President Grant and invited him to call upon us at the  office and give us any items he wished us to record in the  History. I called upon President Young and he gave  me an account of his journey to the Island.    While I was at the Office brethren from  Sanpete arrived with 311 tithing sheep. Bishop Warren  L Snow reported that Arrowpeen was living 12 miles  south of Manti and feeling well but he had a hard  time to keep his people right. While trying to get some  of them to give up stolen horses and cattle they made an  attack upon him and injured his breast which had made  him sick for two weeks. Arrowpeen had delivered  up 17 head of horses which Tintick^'s^ ^band^ who had stolen.  Tinotick who had stolen so many horses ^&c^ ^and cattle^ and killed so  many men had sent word that he wanted to come in  and would give up what he had left and wanted to  know if we were mad. President Young would  make him no presents ^promises^ but thought he deserved to die    The Law of Tithing Reaches Every Man.    Parley P. Pratt on the 2nd of July asked President Young  what he should do with regard to tithing and said he

He did so and was presented to the congregation by President  Young Sunday the 6th of September    Deposit of the Works of the Church  in the foundation of the Temple August the 13th  There were a vast number deposited. I prepared the books and attended to the  deposit. President Young made the Dedication Prayer    The Famous Utah Expedition  Captain Van Vleit arrived in the City on the 8th of Sep. President Young  had his last interview with him on the 13th of Sep. and he left the city for  Washington early next morning    Lot Smith's company burned the U.S. Waggons 
 and President Young ^Kimball^ was teaching doctrine. Among other things he said, any   man that was a prophet of God was born a natural Prophet. It was through   a linage of Prophets: their fathers and mothers were Prophets and propheteses by   birth through the sead of Abraham. This was the case with Joseph Brigham  and himself    He then chastized Thomas Ellerback in a very sharp manner   for insulting him and trying to take a course to bring a collission between   him and Daniel H. Wells. He spoke for more than an hour upon   the subject of the clerks in the various offices and his right place and   station and the place and station of all the Presidency and other men   Brother Thomas asked forgiveness and brother Kimball forgave him   and all was settled.    I called on President Young and gave him his history   to look over from the hand of brother Watt.    On the 13th I called upon President Young. He   came into the Office and asked if it would not be well to put in the   stone into the bottom of the Temple celler and let the men go and   save their grain and for each man to take what grain will do him   for a year.    Daniel H. Wells said that orders had been sent North and   South to watch for the sol^diers^ and not let them come in but to   destroy them the best way they could. Let grain be chached in   the mountains so that they can get at it.    President Young said the thought it would be   best to secure the grain in the mountains.    It was said that Vannetting had 500 lbs of powder   coming and he would go out with cattle to bring it in or he would   do as he was told. Yes said President Young except a righteous   course. President Young said I would rather have a good    powder horn and charger than any flask in the world. He   considered it safer    There was a deep feeling pervading our city about 
 had been travelling and preaching a good deal and had not paid any  tithing. President Young said the law of tithing reached  every man. He should pay his tithing if he had to have five  times as much from the tithing office in order to live and that all he  had from the Tithing Office should be charged to him and that he  should consecrate what he had to the Church. The President said  he should consecrate what he had to the Church that his children  when he was dead should not squander his property and go to  hell.    Indipendance Day    There was quite a military display in Great Salt Lake City  this day. The firing of cannon the ringing of bells display of  flags an oration from Governor Young toasts a ball in the  Social Hall and balls through the various Wards in the evening  celebrated the Anniversary of American Indipendance. An  account of this day's celebration in full may be found in the  Deseret News July 9th.    On the 6th I was called upon in company  with Amasa Lyman to administer to sister Mary Pratt  who had been in labour all day. I was mouth and I  promised her that all should be well and in fifteen minutes  she had a fine boy born.    During the interval to the 24th I spent  the time in the Historian's Office, a portion of it in reading  History to president Young and made a journey as far as  Rush Valley and back    On the 23rd and 24th of July Presidents  Young Kimball and Grant and a large company of Saints  went to the Lake in Big Cottonwood Kanyon to   celebrate the Twenty Fourth of July in commemoration 
 Our Army in the Mountains Run off the cattle &c of the Enemy    A Correspondence is opened between Col Alexander of the  U.S. army and President Young in which the Col. boast of his power  to come in and threatens.

It seemed 
 the soldiers coming in to destroy us as a people.    I had an interview with the President. He gave   me some important instructions with regard to historical matters    I was notified to give the Twelve Apostles an   invitation to meet at the Temple Block at half past six o clock to make   a deposit of the works published by the Church of Jesus Christ of   Latter-day Saints and we met at the Temple block at half   past 6 o'clock.    The Works of the Church deposited in the foundation  of the Temple  Aug. 13th 1857    The company present was Brigham Young Heber C Kimball and   Daniel H. Wells of the Presidency and of the Twelve Apostles Wilford   Woodruff John Taylor Erastus Snow and Franklin Richards. There   was also the Archetect Truman O. Angel Alonzo H. Rolley Benjamen  F. Mitchel Johnathan Pugmire Jr. Edward L Parry (Mason) Henry   Maiben Jesse C. Little Alber^t^ Carrington John Lyon Joseph A. and   Brigham Young sons of the President    President Young and Wilford Woodruff and  Wilford Woodruff packed the books in a stone box two and half   feet long 20 inches deep one foot seven inches wide. It was filled   with our works.    At seven o'clock they were packed in the stone   and fifteen minutes to 8 o'clock the lid was put on soldered  with lead and covered with plaster of Paris and turned bottom   side up and sat in the South East Corner. President Young   then made the    Dedication Prayer    O God our Eternal Father we ask thee in the name of Jesus   Christ that thou wilt bless this deposit which we have made 
 of the enterance of the Pioneers into the Valley. The account thereof  is published in the Deseret News July 30th. I was quite lame with  the rheumatism and had been for several weeks.    On the 4th of August I learned that one of  our clerks in the Historian's Office namely Jonathan Grimshaw  was about to leave us for England. He could not stand the  hard times and did not know whether Mormonism was true or not  so he was going house; but he had taken a very honourable course  in all his business and dealings    Death of Strang.    I learned from the New York Herald of the death of  James J. Strang who had broke off from the Church and  lead away a party. He was shot by two men who had  been his own followers. One ball lodged in the head went  in near the nose and the other in the spine of the back    There was a row in our street on the 4th   and one of the Surveyor's were nearly killed    President Young was with us on the 6th   in the Historian's Office three hours and a half in hearing history  read. He asked if there had been any note made  of his meeting in Nauvoo at Joseph's house at the time  Hyrum preached the Book of Mormon and Doctrine and  Covenants as the Standards while "I took the ground that  they were of no account to us without a living Prophet and  revelation." I told President Young that I would examine  and see. I afterwards found that it was recorded in my  Daily Journal.    Next day I was reading History and President   Kimball called. He said he told brother George A Smith  to give me credit in the Church History for what he prints 
 as an omen of the peace and sereneity of Zion in the coming year and that  it would be to Zion calm and serene this New Year's day.    On Sunday the 3rd the subject arose about burning up our city  President Young said I think we shall use this room for a few years to come  yet I mean to be ready.    The subject of the death of Parley P. Pratt ^came up^. A foreboding of his death he  felt strongly in spirit. As he was about to start for meeting He felt this  so much that he said there are some men in this city who thirsts for my blood. As  he was about to start for meeting this feeling was so strongly upon him that  he did not wish to go. Brother Pollard did not think there was any danger  but Brother Pratt made him promise that he would protect him until his return  before he would leave for the meeting. At this very time Mr McClean  had taken lodgings adjoining Parley's room and was attending his meetings with  loaded weapons seeking an opportunity to kill him. George A Smith  advised Parley P. Pratt not to go to Arkansas but to go direct to Salt Lake  and take care of himself. He told Parley if he went to try to Protect  Eleanor and her children he would loose his life; but he did not take  care of himself nor take George A. Smith's counsel but went to Arkansas  and was murdered by Mr McClean    On the 4th I attended the Legislative Assembly  Both houses sat together. The newspapers were called for and Captain  Van Vleit's report was read.    Next day we also met in joint sessions and it was one of  the most important days of the Assembly. A strong Memorial was  presented to the Assembly and adopted and copies prepared for the signatures  of the members. Also the correspondence of Governor Brigham  Young was presented and read namely his correspondance with the United  States armey and was ordered to be printed.    The following day we were also in joint sessions  Governor Young called in and heard our Memorial to Congress read  It was a strong document calling upon the Congress of the United  States for our Constitutional rights signed by all the officers 
 in the foundation of this Temple. We dedicate all these books papers records   and history unto thee O Lord our God; and I pray in the name of Jesus   Christ our Father in Heaven that thou wilt preserve this deposit the papers and   ink that it may endure that no mold or mildew or decay may come upon  it until it shall come forth for the benefit of the house of Israel and thy   people that it may be a benefit unto them    We also pray thee our father in the name of Jesus   Christ that thou wouldst preserve us from our enemies in this place that   we may have power to finish this Temple even to the top stone. Wilt thou   curse our enemies and bring judgement upon them that they shall not   have power to come into these valleys to disturb us but may we   conquer our enemies and may they be destroyed.    We thank thee our fFather that we are here in   these valleys of the mountains. We thank thee that thou hast blessed   the earth for our sakes that thou has caused the desert to blossom   as the rose and caused wheat corn and vegitation to go ^grow^ for our   benefit. Wilt thou continue thy blessings unto us in these   valleys of the mountains. Wilt thou bless the land and the   water, the valleys mountains kanyon and streams for the   benefit of thy Saints; but may not the wicked or ungodly have   any power here but may our brethren who go forth to war with   our enemies have power to scatter and destroy them.    We pray thee our Father to turn the hearts of   the Lamanites even the sons of Jacob unto us that they may do   thy will and be as a wall of defence around about us    We now ask thee our Father to accept of   this deposit and dedication preserving these records as thou didst the   pot of manna hid up by Aaron that they may be preserved   to come forth in the own due time of the Lord. All these   blessings we ask in the name of Jesus Christ Amen    The following is the list of books pamplets   and newspapers deposited in the Temple Great Salt Lake City 
 from my Journals. President Kimball wished the History to be continued  as the History of Brigham Young and that would show the History  of those who were with him    In looking over the Congressional Reports I made   an index of part 1, 2 and 3 of Messages and Documents and of Financial  Reports concerning Utah and put it into the front of each book for a   referrence    President Young spent the forepart of the day on the  9th hearing History a good deal of it was taken from my Journals. President  Young said I knew while in England by revelation that as we now are God  has been and as he is we shall be if faithful    Sunday the 10th a company of men were called to go  on mission some to Europe and some with brother Blair West on an  exploring tour. Elder Thomas Bullock our chief clerk in the Historian's  Office was among the number bound for Europe.    The First Presidency—Brigham Young Heber C.  Kimball and Jedediah M Grant spent the afternoon of the next day  in hearing the Minutes of the April Conference of 1844 read which  was the last Conference the Twelve spent with the Prophet Joseph  before his death    The next two days the Presidency and Daniel H. Wells  were in the Office hearing History read. On the second day we  finished up to the death of Joseph in Carthage ^Jail^ The brethren  felt full and that they had heard enough for one day. We all  dined at Brother Kimball's namely the Presidency Daniel H Wells  and myself.    On the same day I attended a meeting, in the  Fourteenth Ward, of the Agricultural Society and organized an auxilary  Branch of the Agricultural and Manufacturing Society and appointed  Bishop Hoagland President and Charles H. Basset John R Winder  David Candland and Gilbert Clements Directors    Next day I met in council with Jesse C Little

 James Cummings and Luke Johnson concerning matters in Rush Valley  We concluded to survey it and control matters there according to the Charter  given us.    On Monday the 18th Presidents Young and Kimball  called upon us in the Historian's Office in the afternoon and we finished  up the History of Joseph Smith and took down an account of Brigham  Young father and family and his grandfather and grandmother    I procured a Utah Mountain Spider  or Tarantula which I preserved in a tin box to send with other insects  to Dr Fitch of New York.    On the 21st I had an interview with Dr  J Clinton just arrived from the States. He gave me an account  of his travels &c. He was with Orson Spencer when he died  Orson was resigned and composed and fell asleep in peace.    I also visited the New Historian's Office  opposite President Young's Office.    I was still suffering from rheumatism. I took  a slack lime sweet but it did not seem to do me any good    Revelation to President Young of the Eternal Progress of Man    In the Historian's Office on the 23rd while conversing upon  eternal progress President Young again stated what he had  said on the 9th which I have already recorded. To-day  he spoke more fully upon the matter. He said he knew  by revelation while in England that there would be an eternal  increase in knowledge and that as we now are God once was and that  as he now is we shall be if we continue faithful. "I told this  to brother Lorenzo Snow. While conversing with brother  Willard Richards upon the things of God it came to me that  the Priesthood is a perfect system of Government.    Elder Amasa Lyman spent a short time 
 [FIGURE] 
 with us in the Office in conversing upon the things of the Kingdom    In our prayer circle on Sunday evening President  Young spoke upon good manners good breeding and setting a better example  before the world than they do before us    The mail came in on the 28th and among the letters  received by President Young was one from William Smith. Others were  from George A Smith John Taylor and several other correspondants  We found a strong feeling prevailing in the States against Utah. Our  Delegates had not presented our Memoriel to Congress and the  probability was that they would not during that session    Brigham Still Governor    President Young on Sunday the 31st preached and phrophesied concering  the opposition of the Gentiles. He said he was still Governor of  Utah and should be until the Lord saw fit to remove him. It  was a remarkable discourse and may be found both in the Deseret  News and the Journal of Discourses. This prophescy of President  Young has often been quoted by our enemies at the time of  the Utah Expedition as a proof that the Mormons would  reject the Governor sent which they did not and since it has  been often referred to and better understood by those who have  exclaimed Brigham is Governor of the People still.    On the 2nd of September Heber C. Kimball  and myself laid hands upon Amasa Lyman and blessed him. Brother  Heber was mouth    On the 6th I met with Parley P. Pratt and a  company of Missionaries in the Seventies' Hall. Parley P. Pratt  W. Woodruff Joseph Young Zera Pulsipher A. P. Rockwood and  Horace S. Eldridge blessed 24 missionaries 20 of whom were  going to England and 4 to the States. We also ordained 2  Elders and one Seventy. 
 of these mountains. I will burn every piece of timber wood and board   in the Valleys of the Mountains. Then do you not think that   our Kanyons will be a depôt for the bones of our enemies? I think   they will.    O Israel can you stand those things? (The shout of   "Yes!" from the assembled thousands rent the air]- All you who are   willing to follow me in these things raise your hands towards heaven  -[There were a sea of hands held up.]-    I have had to hold the Indians here for years   from destroying the emigrants. I have had to give them   many thousands of dollars to keep them from killing the Gentile   emigration to California. The United States government   now owe me $50,000 in my official capicity and they will not   pay me a dime but are sending armies at a great expence to destroy   me and this people.    But I will now inform them and all people   that if they attempt to make war upon me I shall not attempt   to restrain them any more but I shall let them do as they please    The United States do not know what they   are doing and the merchants in this place do not know when   they are selling the blood of this people for gold. They were   not going to bring any goods to this place but now that an   army of 2,500 men are coming here to destroy this people they   can bring a great amount of goods. Let them take heed to   their ways.    If the United States send an army and a train   of goods here I may get a part of the pay which they owe me.    I now wish to say to all Gentiles. Send   word to your friends that they must stop crossing this continent to   California for the Indians will kill them for the emigrants   have slaughtered the Indians without any cause or provocation  and if the United States make war upon me I shall not attempt 
 Wilford Woodruff spoke to the Missionaries  for a short time and exhorted them to keep a Journal of their  ministry every day of their lives. He said I would advise  you to get all of your blessings written and preserve them    In writing your Journal I dont care of your  keeping an account of what you eat and drink or where you  sleep unless you should be in a desert or in a wilderness or on  a mountain and have nothing and then if the beast of the  field or the fowles of heaven come and feed you as the ravens  did Elijah^sha^ then I would have you record that but I do not  feel to enjoyn it upon you to make a record of every official   act of your lives. [##1 Kings 17:2-16##] If you baptize confirm ordain or  bless any person or administer to the sick write an account  of it. If you will do this the Church can obtain a  full and correct account    We are not apt to think of the importance  of events as they transpire with us but we feel the importance  of them afterwards. We are living in one of the most  important generations that man ever lived on the earth  and we should write an account of those important events  and transactions which are taking place before our eyes  in fulfilment of the prophecies and revelations of God  There are a great volume of revelations fulfilling in our  day and as they transpire before our eyes we want a   record made of them. If the power and blessings of  God are made manifest in your preservation from danger  and death you should make a record of it and keep an  account of the dealings of God with you daily    I have written all the blessings I  have received and would not take gold for them.    I am in the Historians Office and I  find it very difficult to get or find a record of events 
 to restrain them any longer.    the privelge to leave I will give all people in this Territory who wish to leave   the privelege to leave. I want all to leave who are not willing to follow   me. If there is any of my family my wives who wish to leave I will   send my teams and carry them wherever they wish to go. If it is to hell   I will drive them to the gate but will not let my teams go into hell but   they must turn round and come back but those who wish can enter in    I want the people to go to and save all their grain   and prepare to cache it up in the mountains but dont let your neighbor know   where you put it. I want you to prepare for a seven years siege.    Many other remarks were made and reported in   full by the reporters and all the congregation of the Saints felt to say Amen   to all that President Young said    On the following Sunday I spent the day at the   Tabernacle. Brother Walker spoke in the morning and told of his five   year mission to South Africa and his return to America. He was   appointed to assist off the Handcart Emigration. He took charge of their   baggage which could not get away but wintered in Florence. He started   the train this Spring which was on the way and would be here in a   few weeks.    He was followed by brother Rodgers who had been on   a mission to the Sandwich Islands. He said but a few words and   then he was followed by President Heber C Kimball who was filled   by the power of God and spoke quite lengthy. He said that if   the people would do as they were told they never should be driven   from the Valleys. If we have to take to our tents at all   we will not pitch them again as a resting place until we pitch   them in Jackson County. He said that President Young said when   we first came into the Valley that we should lay up grain for   a seven years famine and we should let the land rest on the   seventh year. Brother Woodruff heard it. (Brother Woodruff   said it was written.) Now the United States are trying 
 as they pass along so complete as we want to make the History. But if  the Elders will take pains to write their official acts so that the Historian  can get hold of them it will be a benefit to the Church. The History  of this Church will remain through time and in eternity    Elder Parley P. Pratt followed and confirmed what I  had said. He observed that he had reflected upon this subject for  years to know what a man should write and I have come to the conclusion  that a man should write his official acts in the Priesthood. I am  sorry that I have not kept more of a Journal than I have. I wish  I had written every man's name that I had ever baptized or  administered unto. It is necessary for us to keep a Journal    W  Mother Lucy Smith    On the afternoon of Sunday the 7th Elder Tripp spoke. He  said he had called upon Mother Smith and she clasped him  in her arms. (They were formerly acquainted) and she said my  son Enoch I am glad to again see you: I am glad to see a man  again from Salt Lake. She cried for joy and said she  had desired for two years to be with the Saints in the valleys  of the mountains but others had hindered her meaning Emma  The aged mother of the Prophet Joseph said give my love to Brigham  and Heber and all the faithful Saints for my heart is with  them.    In the evening after the Prayer Circle Brigham  Young J. M. Grant Wilford Woodruff and all at our circle  laid our hands upon Parley P. Pratt and blessed him: President  Young was mouth. I never heard a better blessing given   to man. It was not written at the time but afterwards  an outline was written by Elder Pratt and filed in the   Historians oOffice. This blessing was given previous to  his going to the States where he was assassinated as he 
 to force a Governor upon us. We will not receive him. The Lord   has said our Governors shall procede out of the midst of us. This is in   the Bible. Brother Woodruff turn to it. (Brother Woodruff opened   the Bible promisciously and opened directly to the passage in the   ##Jeremiah 30:21|30th Chapter of Jeremiah 21st verse)## and read it to the congregation)  Many remarks were made by President Kimball all of which are   reported.    In the Afternoon John Taylor was followed by Daniel   H Wells who spoke in the Spirit and power of God concerning   Zion the Armies of Israel and the Armies of the wicked. He was   ready to fight and defend Zion.    August the 26th President Young said I have sent   General Harney word that I wish for peace and do not wish to fight   anybody but he must not come here with his armies. If he does   I shall stop him.    The President said to Brother Mathews when you   get to California you cannot strengthen us; you must be upon   the watchtower. The nation is determined to make us free   They are determined to drive us to defend ourselves and become   indipendant. The nation is breaking to pieces in spirit. There   is no union among them and before the United States get through   trying to destroy us they will want to let out the job. I told   the people years ago that if they would let us alone we would   convert and revolutionize the world; and if they did not let us alone  but undertook to break us up we would spread abroad the faster   and do the work so much the sooner; and we will do it. If this   nation now makes war upon us we will be free and build up   the kingdom of God the sooner. The people have tried all the   time to destroy us but they have failed all the time    When the Government called for 500 of   our men they had no idea that we should comply with their   request. This plan was laid to destroy the Saints and 
 was on his way home by ^McLane^    At the close of the blessing President Young  remarked: "I am going to take a mission I will name it here  I want to go through this Territory with Heber C Kimball and  J M Grant and I want the Twelve to go. (Brother Parley observed  Brother Woodruff the Historian is all of the Twelve here). Brigham   said I want to go through among this people and preach the  Gospel to them if I can get rid of some of the care of my  temporal business. I do not feel that I am in the path of  my duty to spend so much of my time in attending to temporal  matters. I think more of one soul than I do all that  I have scraped together. I feel that with the assistance  of my brethren I could make a great wake by going through  this Territory and preaching the Gospel to the people. I feel  that some men ought never to be called upon to do a day's  work but they should spend their time in pereaching the   Gospel. They should have a man to take care of  their families. This should be the case with Parley  P. Pratt. He should spend his time preaching. We   should devote our time to the ministry as far as possible    When I returned home I found sister  Sayers and sister Cobb at my house. Sister Sayers wished  me to bless her as she was going to the States on a mission  I laid my hands upon her and blessed her and said that  all should be right with her and that she should be prospered  on her journey and return in peace.    Next day I wrote a letter to Dr  Asa Fitch of New York and sent him a tin box of insects  from Utah including one Tarantula 2 bugs called Scorpian's   Miller 1 Tobacco-worm miller one small spider and  several grasshoppers ^&c^    On the following day I wrote a letter 
 Thomas Benton then had orders in his pocket to destroy the Mormons if they   refused.    Jesus said the time would come when we should have to sell   our coat and buy a sword. That time has come and we have got to   go to and deliver ourselves from our enemies and the Lord will help us   He will fight our battles and we shall become an indipendent kingdom    I feel well and I will tell you why. If I am right   and I know I am and that this people are much nearer their Father's face   thean they ever were before. They are united and willing to do the   will of God and this causes me to rejoice    This people now feel to say it is the kingdom of   God or nothing. It is not my farm or my house but the Kingdom   of God. This is the case with this people. Brother Kimball   said Old Buck was now free. The yoke was off his hneck and   it would not be on his neck again."    On the same day President Young came into   the Historian's Office and sent for me for I was at home and I immediately   went to the office where I found President Young Daniel H Wells and   Franklin D. Richards. As I came in the President said to   me have you a team. I told him that I had a pair of small ponies   He asked if I could spare them. I hesitated a moment and   said Yes sir I can do anything that is wanted. He then said I have   a good pair of horses that I want to let you have as you are laboring   here. I was taken by surprise for it came very unexpectedly   to me. I accepted the horses and was thankful though   perhaps I did not say it at the time. Brother Wells went   and showed them to me and I took them home. They were a   fine large pair of sorrel horses and they were offered 200 bushels   of wheat for them that day    President Young stayed 3 1/2 hours compiling   his history. He remarked that the revelation upon plurality   of wives was given to Joseph Smith in 1831. He revealed it to 
 to Sir William Jackson Hooper Director of the Royal Gardens Kew  London. I sent him a tin box soldered up tight containing the black  and yellow Mountain currant of Mr. Hemways, some service-berries  one paper of Muskeet Seed and one paper of Mus^kcrew^. The  latter I could not describe. The Muskeet grows from ten to 20  feet high is a desert shrub grows in dry places has the appearence  of the black locus and has thorns on it resembling the prickly Ash    I called upon President Young and asked if we should  send out Circulars to the Bishops for the cencus. He said once  a year would do. He told me also that we might move into  our new office on the morrow    The New Historian's Office Opened    Sep. the 10th 1856    On this day we moved the contents of the old Historian's   Office ^which was a part of the Tithing Office^ into the New one  opposite President Youngs house. We had three large  Secretaries filled with books and papers: they were 6 feet  wide 8 feet high and 18 inches deep besides about 20 other  Secretaries desks tables &c and about 1 cord of papers which  Dr Richards and George A Smith had gathered together    On the same day Thomas Bullock took  his leave of us and started on his mission to England. Bro  Leo Hawkins went with him over the Mountains and spent  the night.    Next day President Young went up City Creek and  saw two bears: brother Kesler killed one of them    On the 12th Presidents Young Kimball  and grant visited us at the New Historian's Office.  Brother Kimball said may the blessing of God rest upon 
 Oliver Cowdery alone upon the solemn pledge that he would not reveal it   nor act upon it but he did act upon it in a secret manner and that was   the cause of his overthrow.    President Young also said that the United States are   driving this people to war sooner than is for their good for we are   civilizing the Indians and if they would give us time we would give   them a knowledge so that when they do fight the Gentiles they   would have the judgement and not kill women and children and they who   ought not to be killed. There are now many of the emigration on   the way to Carson Valley. The Gentile emigrants shoot the Indians   wherever they meet with them and the Indians will now retalitate and   will kill innocent people. One woman who had fitted out to   home here to investigate Mormonism was killed and all her   teamsters and all these were killed through the folly of emigrants.    On Sunday the 30th of August we had   a good day. The Presidency and several others of the leaders spoke   In the evening at the Prayer Circle the contempteble speech of   Stephen Arnold Douglass was read and the answer of Albert   Carrington to the speech was also read. Also the instruction   of Governor Young in case we were invaded by an enemy   Many remarks were made upon the apparently approaching   crisis. President Young said that many of the brethren   had many fears about the Lamanites because the Gentiles   were making them presents. You need to have no fears   upon the subject for if the nation gives them a few million   it will not be all that is their due and then they will turn round   and take the rest. We need have no fears but what   the Lamanites will be prepared to fill their mission. I cannot   feel that the time has come for us to do a great deal of hard   fighting. We shall have help and strength and the promises   of God will be verified unto us.    On the 1st of September brother Hamlin 
 this place from this time henceforth and forever    Dedication of the Historian's Office.    September the 15th 1856    I met the brethren connected with the Historian's Office  and told them my feelings was to dedicate the place unto  the Lord and so we all knelt down excepting J V Long  who was scribe and I offored up the prayer of which the  following is a synopsis    "O God our Eternal Father we bow  before thee this morning beneath this roof for the purpose  of dedicating the Historian's Office unto the Lord our God  We feel this to be our duty; as we consider this to be a  blessing unto us that we have the privilege of being located  in these Valleys where we can worship thee and build  Temples Tabernacles and cities unto thy Holy name and  have none to molest us or make us affraid    We rejoice in the power of the Priesthood  which thoue hast given unto thy servants through the  power of which and the mercy of God we are protected and  preserved from the wickedness and abominations of the world  We thank thee O Lord that the power of the Priesthood and  righteousness governs and controls us and predominates in these  Valleys of the Mountains. For these things we fell to  offer up our prayers with thanksgiving.    And inasmuch as we have the privelege  of having an Office built for thy servants to occupy while  writing and keeping a history of the Church and kingdom  of God upon the earth in these last days we fell it a  privelege to bow before thee and dedicate this house unto 
 arrived from the Santa Clara Mission with some 12 Indian Chiefs who   had come to see President Young. One was the [blank space] Chief. His name is   Tots-I-gavets the chief of the Pieds of the Deserts and Santa Clara and   Rio Virgin. He had a chief with him of the Indians of hHarmony   Kanosh the Chief of the Parvants and Amon Walker's brother. President   Young had an interview with the Indians for about one hour. Mr Eddy   came into the Office and spent several hours looking at our works. He was   the partener of Mr Sharp the inventor of the Sharp's rifles.    We had an express arrive on the morning of the 5th   stating that Col. Johnson was at Ash Hollow with some 2000 men   travelling some 15 miles per day. Col. Sumner had burned some   300 Cheians lodges and killed some few Indians and 2 soldiers were   killed and 7 wounded. Sixty men with Captain Jones and the wounded   were sent to Fort Kerney and the Chians overtook them and cut them   to pieces so bad that no trace of them could be found.    Our emigration was getting along pretty well   so that the Lord was hearing our prayers and hedging up the   way of our enemies. General Harney was retained as the military   Governor of Kansas    Thomas B. Marsh Presented to the Congregation  Sunday the 6th of Sep 1857    On this day Thomas B. Marsh former President of the Twelve   Apostles was presented by President Young to the congregation for them   to look upon and behold the wreck and relic of a man who once   was an Apostle and the President of the Apostles but who had apostatized   and staid in the world until he had become old a cripple palsied   miserable unhappy and worthless so much so that his wife the   world and the devil had cut him off as ^of^ no use to anybody   He had now come to the Saints for mercy and help. President  Young made a few remarks concerning him and then Thomas 
 the Lord our God even our Father in heaven. And by virtue of the  Holy Priesthood vested in us and in the name of Jesus Christ we do  dedicate and consecrate it unto the Lord our God and we set it apart  that it may contain the holy records of the Church and Kingdom of God  and we ask in the name of Jesus Christ that it may be sanctified  and holy unto thy name and we pray that we may be inspired by the  gift and power of the Holy Ghost while acting as historians or clerks  for the Church. May we keep a true and faithful record  and history of thy Church and Kingdom and of thy servants and may  it be kept in that way and manner that it may be acceptable unto  thee O Lord and unto thy servants the Presidency of thy Church    We dedicate this house unto thee from the  foundation to the top thereof and we pray that the spirit and  power of the Devil may never have dominion over any man who  labours in this office, or place in his mind    We pray that thou wilt bless us O Lord with  thy Holy Spirit that we may never profane thy name in this  house or dishonour the Holy Priesthood or bring reproach upon  thy cause or grieve thy Holy Spirit in any way. And  we ask thee to bless us and prepare us in all things and bring  to our remembaerance all things neccessary to be written of this  history and that papers and documents and all ^that is^ necessary may  be brought to us to enable us to compile a right, useful  and proper history    I pray thee my Father in heaven that thou  wilt bless these my brethren who are my companions in this Office that  our hearts may be united in the bonds of the Holy Priesthood according  to the anointing and endowments given unto us that we may be  one in spirit in heart in faith and works as touching the cause  and kingdom in which we are engaged and we ask thee to bless  all things that pertain to this Office that when thy servants  Brigham Heber and Jedediah may come to visit us that they may 
 B Marsh arose and addressed the people for a short time and warned the   people not to apostatize and to look to him as an example of misery   and one who had suffered the wrath of God in consequence of denying   the faith. He wished to be forgiven by the Church. President   Young put the vote to the assembly if they would receive him into full   fellowship notwithstanding all his heinous sins. All voted to a   man to receive him.    In the Prayer meeting in the President's upper   room in the evening we heard letters read from Samuel Richards   Snider H. S. Eldridge and Gooseback. President Young said   Brother Bernhisel I presume we shall not have any one in Congress   next Winter to present our memorials and interest. (J. M. Bernhisel   I think not.) I think it will make some of the people squirm   when they hear that I am taking the property which the Goverment   has sent into this Territory. Some of our brethren going down   to the States met about 60 of the Chians. They were very friendly   to them. The Indians stole 800 fat cattle and the rest were driven   back to the States so the Army has no cattle with them only for   their present use.    Some said that they beleived that the Indians   who stole the cattle were half Mormons and began to damn them   Brother Murdock remarked we are all Mormons here in this   company and I dont wish to hear my friends abused    President Young said what will   the people of Europe think when they come to hear that Brigham   Young is at the head of the Viglance Committee in California   and the Kansas troubles and that the Government of the   United States could not remove him until the Lord saw fit   to let them.    The world accuse me of controling the affairs of   of California and Kansas &c. The people believe that we   have a band called the Danites but how could they exist so 
 feel the Spirit of God and the spirit of peace resting upon them  while they are beneath this roof; and may we understand our duty  towards them in all things    We pray thee to hear us and to accept of  this dedication    We pray thee also to bless the quorum of the  Twelve Apostles the Seventies and all the authorities and quorums  of the Church and bless those of thy Servants who are among  the nations of the earth and grant that they may be inspired  to send us accounts of their works that we may be enabled to  keep a true and faithful record so that when we have gone  into the world of Spirits the Saints may read be blessed in  reading our record which we have kept.    We ask thee O God Lord to grant these  our requests and every other blessing which thou see^st^ we  need and in the end of our probation may we be saved  in thy Kingdom and the glory of our salvation we will   ascribe to God the Father through JChrist our Redeemer: Even  so, Amen.    Arrival Of The First Hand Cart Companies    September the 26th 1856    Word was brought in the evening before that two of the Hand-  Cart Companies were camped between the two mountains and  would be in to-day. So President Young called together  a body of Lanceers "Ballo's Brass Band" and the "Nauvoo  Brass Band" and with President Kimball General Wells  Professor Carrington and many other citizens hein carriages  he went out to meet them and to escort them into  the city 
 long without sheding blood for we cannot find that they have killed anybody   But I do not know of any such men    I think that James Buchannan has got into a bad   fix. He has got the yoke on his neck and has to carry it alone with   no ox to carry the other end. But he is pounding his own shins and   will soon pound the shins of others for the moment he gave consent to send   an army to destroy this people he placed himself as the shedder of innocent   blood and the judgements of God will follow him. When war does break   out between the North and the South it will be most bloody    George A. Smith said that the only way   for the President of the United States to get out of his troubles was to   get a bill through Congress to admit any Territory as soon as they had   population enough to organize a State Government and to be received   at once into the Union with equal privileges with the other States    President Young then said let me suggest a   matter. Brother Smith is presiding at Limhi Salma River. Now   do we not want a station half way from here: say near Fort Hall   Should we not send men, say 20 to make a station there. (It was   thought best to do so). He said the North is the place for us   not the South. No one but the Saints would meet the cold   North country. This is the key of this continant and I think we   had better keep near the lock and have the key in our own hands  If we send a company we want to send them this fall so that we   can put in grain this season.    On the 8th Captain Van Vleit of the   United States service arrived in the city in the evening and   he had an interview with Governor Young    On the next day Captain Van Vleit met with the   Governor the Presidency and Twelve and some 100 citizens in the Social   Hall at 9 o'clock. He presented Governor Young with a   letter of instructions or request which was read before the Assembly   and but little said and a great deal thought. 
 They met the companies at the foot of the Little Mountain  on the west side of it. Elder Edmund Elsworth son-in-law to Brigham   Young was the captain of the first company and Daniel D. McArthur  was the captain of the second company. Both companies consisted  of 96 Hand-carts 8 waggons and 486 souls    It was a very affecting meeting. Presidents Young  and Kimball walked up the Mountain through the company and saluted  the Saints and then organized the company for travelling into the city  One half of the company of Lancers went in front followed by the  Presidency and citizens; then the Marshal of the city Jesse C Little;  then the bands of music. After the escort came Captain Edmund  Elsworth with his Hand-cart Company and then Daniel D McArthur  followed with the second Hand-cart Company and the remainder  of the company of Lancers brought up the rear. In this way  they started for the city    Captain Leonard Hardy took Bishop Hunter  and myself into a buggy and we met the company as they entered  the borders of the city and we fell into the ranks behind the Presidency    The people of the city gathered on each side  of the road and the streets. It was affecting to see such a  strange sight of about five hundred people enter the city of the  Great Salt Lake who had travelled on foot one thousand five  hundred miles drawing their handcarts all the way. Women  children and old men had drawn their bedding clothing and food  all the way and this company of the poor Saints from England  had travelled the whole distance in nine weeks. They were  covered with dust and somewhat worn down but cheerful. They  had beaten any horse or ox teams during the time    The Handcart companies passed up on  South Temple Street, the Deseret Store, by Wilford Woodruff's  house down to the Grove and then down to the public square  and there formed into two lines and camped for the night. 
 Captain Van Vleit asked if there was lumber to be   bought and grain and hay &c. President Young said that there was   plenty in the country and asked if there was any one person who could   supply Captain Van Vleit with any lumber that he might want   Brother Samuel Snider arose and said he could supply 10,000 feet   of lumber. No one else said anything    President Young had a private conversation with   Captain Van Vleit in the afternoon and walked with him through   his garden and orchard and through Professor Carrington's. The   Captain asked Mrs Carrington if she was willing to cut down her   fine peach orchard for her faith and religion. She said yes   and would set up nights to do it if it became necessary    On the next day President Young took the   Captain through his house and introduced him to his family    On the 12th we got an express in the   morning saying that there were some 900 troops on the way this   side of the Laramie and some 12 Government baggage trains.    Captain Van Vleit came into the Office   this day and President Young had a good deal of talk with him.  He said I do not want to fight the United States but if they drive us   to it we shall do the best we can and I tell you as God lives we   shall come off conquerer for we trust in God. For God has  set up his kingdom upon the earth and it will never fall but it will   stand. We shall do all we can not to fight but if they drive us to it   God will overthrow them. If they would let us alone and say to the   mobs now you may go and kill the mMormons if you can but we   will have nothing to do with it, this is all we would ask of them   But for the Government of the United States to array their armies   against us it is too dispicable and damnable for any honourable nation   and God will have them in derision for doing it    The Government has all the time   endeavoured to destroy us in an underhanded manner; but now if 
 As soon as they were camped President Young  stood up in his carriage and called upon the Bishops and  multitude who had gathered together to see the Handcart Companies  to bring them provisions and feed them to night to morrow  morning and noon and night again and while they stop here  I wish you all to tarry here until you are dismissed and I bless  you all in doing good and keeping the commandments of God    We then returned to our homes and  the Bishops and people brought the Hand Cart companies   all the provisions necessary    Captain Edmund Elsworth saluted his wives and  children as he passed his house but did not stop for anything  until his company was camped. He led the First Handcart  company by drawing the front handcart with three other^s^  breathren drawing their handcarts with him in the frontrank    Next day I call upon President Young  upon Church business. Among other things he said he  thought these hand cart companyi^es^ had a better time than the  teams had. "They have not had as hard a time as  we had in going to Missouri in 1833^4^. Then I went  to Missouri stayed in the cholera 15 days then returned to   Kirtland within three months making over 3000 miles which  ^and^ I walked all the way and lay ^laid^ on the ground every night; but  if I had to fit out a company I would have fitted out the  carts different to what they were."    During the moring Presidents Young Kimball  Albert Carrington Edmund Elsworth and myself rode down  to the Public Square to visit the Handcart Companies. The  emigrant Saints generally looked well and cheerful. They  shook our hands warmly. There was a great quantity  of provisions on hand in the camp brought in by the citizens  I laid hands upon one of the bretheren who was taken sick 
 they come against us we will whip them all the time and you will see that   we will do it. The United States are sending their armies to hold us still   until a mob can come and kill us and they have done this all the time    We are the supporters of the United States Constitution   and we love the Constitution and laws of the United States but it is the   corrupt administeration of those laws that we are suffering under and   not the laws.    If the laws had been carried out in the Missouri it would have   hung Governor Boggs between the heavens and the earth and all his friends   who was in the murdering and expelling of the Saints from the States. They   shot down the Mormons whenever they could. They killed Joseph and   Hyrum. Then when Col. Hardan came into Nauvoo with his armies   he did not enquire who killed Joseph Smith and Hyrum nor any of the   Saints who had been killed but enquired for some missing man that we   knew nothing about and said he should hold |me responsible for the life   of that man.    This has been the course with the Government all the time   We got up a "memorial" or "Declaration" to the Congress of the United   States last Winter    The Declaration was then read to Captain Van Vleit who   after hearing it said, "I cannot find any fault with it only it is couched in   very strong language." President Young replied, "That is what I intended   and I will now ask Captain Van Vleit if Drummond was not the main   cause of the United States sending their armies against us?"    The Captain said "I think it is;" and the President   continued, "There is not any of the Government officers which have been   sent here who have any interests with us but they have tried to destroy   us.    Captain Van Vleit said this is the case with most men in the   Territories. They receive their offices as steping stones to the senatorship   but they have no interest with the people. This people have been   lied about the worst of ^any^ people I ever saw. The greatest hold the 
 during the night. President Young said the people might have  their handcarts    Brother Elsworth pointed out a mule which he rode  after a Buffalo which he had wounded. The mule took right  after the buffalo and the mad wounded animal turned and  took after the mule. They almost met together when the  ^mule^ turned and ran back so suddenly that he threw Elsworth to the  ground. The buffalo plunged at him and Elsworth  punched the aminal with the mugzgle of his gun in the  eye so hard a blow that the buffalo fell to his knees but got  up again and ran away. It broke the rifle. Brother Elsworth  was a very strong man. His mule ran five miles to camp  and he had to walk    Next day was Sunday and several of the  returned missionaries spoke to the congregation    The Place Where Adam Offered His First Sacrifice    President Kimball said I have told the people to day  far greater things than drawing hand carts to Zion Joseph  Smith took President Brigham Young and myself to the very  spot in Adam-Ondi-Aman where Adam offered up his first  sacrifice on a spot now called Hogback    Dream of Daniel H Wells    Daniel H Wells said I had a dream last night and I saw a  butcher's cleaver in the heavens in the East and I tried to ^show it to^ Bishop  Pettigrew and he could not see it. I felt that there was a struggle  near and a great slaughter and much nearer than the people  are aware of    President Kimball said it would be better 
 world have now upon you is they accuse you of burning 900 vols of the   United States Statutes    Thomas Williams who was one of the oweners of the   books which were burned denies that there were any of the books of the   United States burned.    President Young said I have told the people all the   time that all I asked of them was to tell the truth about us to pay   their debts steal nothing and they are welcome to go their way    Now if this Government has arrived at that State  that they will try to kill the people for their religion no honourable men should   be afraid of them.    President Young then told the story about the Qucaker  whom the Yankee went to whip. The quaker said that he was not   the man that he wanted. He had not done anything wrong but the   man said he would whip him anyhow. So the quaker laid   down his hat and coat and said "Lie there religion until I whip this man"  and he did whip tremendiously. It will be so with the United   States. If they insist in whipping us they will get awfully whipped    Captain Van Vleit, we have treated all   men as well as we have you who have been sent here as officers of the   the United States Government. We wish still to treat them well   and we would like to ward off this blow if we could. But the   United States are determined to drive us to fight. We cannot do   anything but what the Government will take exception to it. They   will kill us if they can. I have proof of this. They killed   Joseph and Hyrum in jail notwithstanding the faith of the Governor  the army and the States was pledged to protect them and when they   had killed them they got a writ for me. I carried a large bowie   knife with and I said that any man who laid hands upon my   sholder and said Mr Young you are my prisoner I would send   that man to hell across lots. I have said that all the time   since and I say it now 
 for one half of the people to be cut off than for the rest to suffer  as they had done    Dedication Of The Baptisimal Font    October the 2nd 1856    I met with Presidents Brigham Young Heber C. Kimball  and Jediediah M. Grant at the House of the Lord for the purpose  of dedicating the Baptisimal Font built on the East side of the  House of the Lord.    There were also present besides the Presidency and  Wilford Woodruff Bishop Edward Hunter Joseph Young President  of the Seventies Daniel H. Wells Albert Carrington, Leonard  W. Hardy Jesse C Little and Gilbert Clements.    Dedication Prayer By Heber C Kimball    President Young called upon Heber C Kimball to be  mouth in the Dedication Prayer. The following is a   Synopsis of it reported by Wilford Woodruff    "O, God the Eternal Father, we bow down  before thee on this Font which has been made by thy servants  to baptize thy people in, for the purpose of dedicating it unto  the Lord our God.    We dedicate ourselves before thee O Lord  and we ask thee in the name of Jesus Christ to forgive us all  our sins, that we may have thy Holy Spirit to guide us in  all things that we may be guided in the ways of the Lord and  that we may never do wrong. Look upon us O God who  have now bowed before thee around this Font and help us to  do thy will in all things, acknowledge thee in all things  and honour thee and worship thee at all times. Help 
 I have broken no law, neither will I be taken by any   United States officers to be killed as they have killed Joseph. They did once   take a bogus Brigham which was brother Miller and took him to Carthage and   did not find out his mistake until they got him there    Captain Van Vleit said I do not think that it is the   intention of the Government to take you but to install a new Governor in this   Territory.    President Young replied "I believe you tell the truth—that you believe   this but you do not know their intentions as well as I do. When you get   away from here you will think of a great many things which you have seen   and heard. The people have all the time accused us of colleaguing   with the Indians against the Government and they were much afraid that   Joseph Smith would go among the Indians and they watched to keep him   away from them but now they have driven us into their midst. And  now I want you to watch the signs and you will see that God will work   against the nation who are trying to destroy both the Indians and the   Mormons. The Government has become corrupt and they are the   ones who are breaking the Constitution of the United States and if it is   ever saved it will be saved by the Mormons who are the Elders   of Israel.    On Sunday the 13th after John Taylor had spoken President   Young followed and said that he had the persecution of the Saints before   him all the morning, that he was righteously angry; that he was   so angry he could not preach. But he did preach in the power of   God and told his feelings.    Captain Van Vleit sat by and when President   Young spoke of the wickedness and corruption of the Government it made   him feel [blank space]    At the close of the meeting we met with the Missionaries who   were appointed to lecture upon home manufactures. We then went   into council with the Presidency to select a company of missionaries   to go and make a settlement on Blackfoot Fork 63 volunteered 
 us to honour our tabernacles that we may never disgrace ourselves in  anything. Grant unto us thy Holy Spirit that it may quicken  our understanding and bring to our rememberance all things which are  necessary for us in the discharge of our duties.    We now dedicate this Font to thee O, God. We  consecrate it unto thee in the name of Jesus Christ. Let thyine  angel O Lord touch this water and this Font with his finger that  it may be holy unto the Lord. May no unclean thing ever  enter into this font to polute it. We dedicate ourselves our  wives children and all that we have unto thee O Lord our God  May we be thine for ever and all that we have    Now O Lord accept of this dedication at  our hands and as we go into this water may our sins be forgiven  and not be remembered against us any more. May we feel  the power of God and have power to work a great reformation  among this people; and may this people triumph over our  enemies; and may not our enemies hever again have power  over us. But willt thou cause thine indignation to burn  against them that they shall not have any power to do thy  people harm.    Now O Lord look down upon thy servant  Brigham and clothe him with thy power that he may know the  workings of the power of the Devil in the Church and among  this people; and may he have power to stretch forth his  hand unto thy people and do thy work.    We now dedicate this font to baptize the  living and the living for the dead and for every purpose which  is necessary to perform the work of the Lord our God even that  the generations which are dead and passed away may be saved  and that the sins of the living may be washed away and  that the sick may be healed of every infirmity that we   may be renewed in body and spirit in all things. 
 and 42 of them were chosen.    At the close of this Council I went direct to the   meeting at the Tabernacle and during the afternoon President Young spoke and   gave Uncle Sam considerable hell fire for their wickedness. We then   went in-to our Prayer Circle and President Young feasted the brethren upon   peaches and grapes as we had nothing to eat during the day. At the   close of prayers Captain Van Vleit met us at the stairs and said he   had an express from the States and wished to meet with Governor Young    President Young's Last, Important Interview with Cap. Van Vleit  Sunday Evening Sepr 13, 1857    In the evening I went to Captain Hooper's and met with Captain   Van Vleit, and a short time after President Brigham Young Daniel H. Wells   A. Carrington Orson Hyde John Taylor and a number of others came in.   Captain Van Vleit was preparing to leave at 3 o'clock in the morning   and President Young was now to have his last interview with him and   he wish^ed^ to talk to him in a plain manner    President Young said he wished Captain Van Vleit   to report at Washington just as things were here. He said I have   seen the sufferings of this people through their persecutions from the   people of the United States for the last 25 years and I will not hear it   any longer.    We have always treated the United States officers well but   they have constantly lied about us and tried to destroy us all the   time. We would still have received their Governors and officers  if they had sent them here without an army; but inasmuch as they   are now disposed to send an army here to hold as while others run   their red hot iron into us and then kill us we will now say we   will not have either their soldiers armies or officers any more here   at all and you may tell them so. We will just fight for   our liberty and rights from this day forth. 
 Accept of this dedication at our hands O Lord  and hear our prayers and we will give all the glory to God  our Heavenly Father; and we ask it in the name of Jesus  Christ: Amen.    After the dedication of the Font President Brigham  Young went down into the water in the Font and baptized Presidents  Heber Chase Kimball and Jedediah M Grant    Re-Confirmation and Baptism of the First Presidency and Others    at the Dedication of the Font Oct 2, 1856, at the time of the Reformation    Confirmation of Heber C Kimball    After the President had baptized his Counsellors Heber C  Kimball and J. M. Grant he confirmed and blessed Heber as   follows:    Brother Heber Chase; In the name of Jesus Christ  I lay my hands upon your head and I confirm you to be  a member in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints  and I seal upon you the gift of the Holy Ghost and Eternal  Life and I ordain and seal upon your head to be a  Prophet Seer and Revelator in the Church and Kingdom of  God and every blessing which has been sealed upon you and  we seal upon you the Gift of the Holy Ghost and we seal you  up unto Eternal Life in the name of Jesus Christ: Amen.

Heber C Kimball then said;    "Brother Jedediah, In the name of Jesus  Christ we lay our hands upon your head and we confirm 
 overcharged  110528 $Pages written 1575 + $84,600 = $86,175    Whenever I think of letting their troops come in here and their   officers I can see nothing but death and darkness before me and before this people  but when I say they shall not come here light bursts upon me and I can see   light before me and this people and this is the way all of this people feel    The intention of the Government is to destroy us and   we are determined they shall not do it. If the Government of the United   States persists in sending armies to destroy us, in the name of the Lord  we shall conquer them. If the Government calls for volunteers in   California and the people turn out to come to destroy us they will find their   own building in flames before they get far from home and so throughout   the United States    Again if they commence the war I shall not hold the   Indians still by the wrist any longer for white man to shoot at them; but I   shall let them go ahead and do as they please and I shall carry the war  into their own land and they will want to let out the job before they   get half through. And even should an army of 50,000 men  get into this Valley when they get here they would find nothing but   a barren waste.    We shall burn everything that is wood and we should   burn every acre of grass and you may tell them that they must bring  with them their forage for their horses and mules for they will not   find anything to eat in this Territory when they come    Again you may tell them they must stop all   emigration across this continent for they cannot travel in safety. The   Indians will kill all who attempt it. You may tell Judge Douglass  that when he comes here again to enter into a treaty of peace we   shall dictate those terms of peace and not he as he did before    Captain Van Vleit said that if our Government   pushed forward this thing and made war against us he should   withdraw from the army for he would not have a hand in   shedding the blood of American citizens    After closing his remarks President Young said 
 you to be a member in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and we  seal upon you all the keys of the Holy Priesthood even to be a Prophet Seer  and Revelator in the Church and Kingdom of God and every blessing which  has ever been sealed upon you and we seal upon you the gift of the Holy  Ghost; and we seal you up unto Eternal Life in the name of Jesus  Christ: Amen    Baptisim and Confirmation of Brigham Young by H. C Kimball    Heber C Kimball then baptized President Brigham Young and  assisted by Jedediah M. Grant he confirmed and blessed him as   follows:    Brother Brigham Young we lay our hands upon your  head and confirm you to be a member in the Church of Jesus  Christ of Latter-day Saints, and we seal upon your head the  Holy Ghost Priesthood with all the keys powers and blessings  appertaining thereunto even to be a Prophet Seer and Revelator  in the Church and Kingdom of God and over the house of Israel  and we seal upon your head all the blessings which were  sealed upon you by the Prophet Joseph. And we say unto you  that you shall have power over your enemies and you shall  not be slain by them but you shall live to see them overthrown  and to see the Saints come off victorious over their enemies  And I seal these blessings upon your in the name of Jesus   Christ: Amen    Baptism and Confirmation of Wilford Woodruff.    President Brigham Young then baptized me and all the  Presidency laid their hands upon me and confirmed and  blessed me. President Jedediah M. Grant was mouth.    "Brother Wilford Woodruff in the name of Jesus 
 God had set up his kingdom upon the earth and it was here and the Lord  would sustain that Kingdom and he would destroy all who fought  against it; and if the armies of the United States come against   us the Lord would permit them to be destroyed    At the close of the remarks the President  said to Captain Van Vleit as citizens we are friends and shook   hands in a friendly manner and wished each other well. We all   wished the Captain well.    I then went home and put up a box of peaches   of 32 dozen for the Hon. J. M. Bernhisel and Captain Van Vleit.  I then went to the Historian's Office and from thence to President Young's   Office and conversed with President Young Wells and Carrington until   midnight. This day J. M. Bernhisel was set apart for his   mission to Washington. I wrote his blessing    On the 164th of September in the afternoon   President Young met in Council with Heber C Kimball Daniel H Wells  and the Twelve and several others and resolved to proclaim the   Territory under marshal law. The Proclamation of the Governor   was read and accepted    On the evening of the 18th an express arrived from   the brethren in the Mountains. They brought word that 700 of   the army were at the Pacific Springs and that they kept but five   men on guard to take charge of their animals and they would not give   them guns for fear they would run away. They were travelling  about 15 miles per day. Their animals were much worn down  and the feed was scarce. Our own brethren many of them were   sick and were living upon bread alone and they wanted provisions   sent to them    Orders issued the next day for a number of waggons   to be fitted out and go with provisions to our brethren in the   Mountains. I was called upon for a horse team. Col Harman's   regiment was out this day with all their baggage waggons. They

Baptisim and Confirmation of Bishop Edward Hunter.    President Brigham Young then baptized Edward Hunter presiding  Bishop of the Church and confirmed him. President Young  was mouth and said:    Brother Edward Hunter we lay our hands  upon your head in the name of Jesus Christ and we confirm  you to be an member in the Church of Jesus Christ of  Latter-day Saints and we seal upon you the gift of the Holy  Ghost and Priesthood and Bishoprick and the keys thereof  and we seal upon your head all the gifts blessings priesthood  and power which has ever been sealed upon you by the Prophet  Joseph or any of the servants of God: and we say that you  shall have power to magnify your calling as the Chief Bishop  in the Church and Kingdom of God on earth. The Spirit  and power of the Holy Ghost and revelation shall rest upon  you in power and we seal you up unto Eternal Life and  we seal upon your head every blessing your heart can  desire in the name of Jesus Christ: Amen."    President Young then baptized  the following persons: 
 made quite a display    Elder Nathaniel V. Jones arrived on the morning of the 25 from   the United States Army with the express. He visited with Captain Van   Vleit both regiments. The first was the 10th Regiment. This was a   full regiment. The officers were young and full of fire and they swore they   would come in anyhow; they could whip out Utah. Captain Van Vleit   advised them not to come for they could yet [get] nothing and they would have   to fight their way; but they swore they would fight their way through   After Captain Van Vleit left them they marched 30 miles the next day.    The second regiment they met with were old officers  They considered the matter over more and thought it an imposition to be sent out   here and as a political movement to kill innocent people or to get killed. They   were to be at the Pacific Springs that night and our brethren were to commence   operations upon them.    Next day I had some conversation with general Wells upon   the subject of going into the Mountains. He said he should soon go   and take with him George A. Smith and John Taylor as councillors  He was going to take but a part of his staff and he wished me to stay at   home in the Office for the present. This was according to counsel.    The following conversation passed between President  Young and Captain Van Vleit not before recorded in this Journal. Captain   Van Vleit said I think that Congress will try to do all they can against you   President Young said if God inspires any man to speak for us it will be well   We have got to trust in God. If you will speak in favor of us and I   think you will the Lord will bless you for so doing. He will require it of   you. We have refuted lies so long that we have got tired of it and we   shall now trust in God for the future. Congress could send out an   investigating committee to Kansas or to any other place but to Utah. Upon   the mere rumor of lies they could send out 2000 soldiers to Utah to destroy the   people without investigating the subject at all    Captain Van Vleit said the Government may yet send   out one to Utah and consider it policy before they get through with it 
 Joseph Young Daniel H. Wells Albert Carrington  Leonard W. Hardy Jesse C Little and Gilbert Clements and  he was mouth in confirming them all excepting Daniel H. Wells  whom Heber C Kimball spoke over    Return of Franklin Richards and other Missionaries from Europe.    October the 4th 1856    On this day missionaries from Europe arrived home. They  arrived in the city at half past three oclock. The company  consisted of Franklin D. Richards Daniel Spencer Joseph A  Young William H. Kimball James Ferguson George D.  Grant N. H. Felt James McGaw John Van Cott  C. H. Wheelock Wm C Dunbar and John D. T. McAllister  When Presidents Young and Kimball met their sons and  friends with a hearty wealcome theere were tears of joy shed    Next day was Sunday and the day was  occupied by the returned Missionaries    At the close of the meeting President Brigham  Young went down into the Font and baptized men women and  children of his own family about 75 in number    Then President Heber C. Kimball went  down into the water and baptized about 75 mostly of his own  family but some were of my family and the families of  others of the Twelve and afterwards Lorenzo Young went into  the water and baptized 25 persons making 175 souls all  of whom were confirmed under the hands of Heber C Kimblall  J. M. Grant Wilford Woodruff and Joseph Young; but  a few of the last Daniel H. Wells and John Van Cott  assisted in confirming    In the meeting this day President Young 
 President Young said I do think that God has sent you out   here and that good will grow out of it. I was glad when I learned that you   were coming.    Captain Van Vleit replied I am very anxious to get back to Washington  as soon as I can. I heard officially that General Harney was recalled to   Kansas to officiate as Governor. I shall stop the train on Hams Fork on   my own responsibility and leave them there.    President Young said if we can keep the peace for   this Winter I do think there will be something turn up that may save so much   shedding of blood. Captain Van Vleit observed I think so too. The   troops will have to stop on Hams Fork; for their provisions will be late coming   up. I do not think there is more than 1000 troops coming. There   is one regiment from the Florida war. There is not more than 300 men   They have been reduced by the scurvey. That Florida War has cost   many millions of money. It was a speculating scheme. There   are not more than 100 Indian warriors and they have got hiding places   which no man can find. It is seldom you can kill one. You may   accidentally storm ball into one as you would a patridge. Well   this Florida regiment are old men and the regiment is worn out    Sunday the 27th I called upon Elder Taylor to get   the History of Joseph which he had written but he informed me we had left   it at the Historian's Office the evening before. He was preparing to go   into the Mountains with George A. Smith and General D. H Wells   and his staff or a part of it. They got ready and left the city about   1 o'clock P.M.    On Monday the 28th we received an express from our   army in the Moutains saying that our enemies were marching strongly   towards us. The brethren tried to stampeded the animals of the army   but they found them all chaned by the feet, so they could not run; a small   company of our brethren also tried to stampede some oxen and they failed   in it.    Brother Jones informed me that Captain Van Vleit told the army ^tried to^ 
 made a call for sixty teams twelve tons of flour and 40 extra  teamsters to go into the mountains to help in the back emigration  of Hand-cart companies.    General Conference of the Church  held  In the Bowery Great Salt Lake City  October the 6th 1856    The Conference commenced at 10 o'clock AM    There were present on the Stand of  the  Presidency: Brigham Young Heber C. Kimball and  Jedediah M. Grant.    Of the Twelve: Wilford Woodruff Lorenzo   Snow and Franklin D. Richards who had just returned  from the Presidency of the European mission    The other quorums of the Church were also numerously  represented on the Stand with the Returned Missionaries  and there was convened together a vast congregation    After singing and prayer President Young  said our Conference is now open and the first business is to  gather together the clothing shoes flour and the teams and  man them and start them back into the mountains  after the Handcart and other companies who are back on  the Plains. They were below Laramie some of them    The following articles were brought  in to send back to feed clothe and help the poor Saints    Twenty sidx thousand six hundred and eighty  pounds of flour thirty one bushels of onions ^1211 pounds of meat^  five bushels of oats eight ^188^ dollars in cash one hundred and six  blankets fifty three coats fifty vests twenty nine shawls 
 persuade the army to stay on Hams Fork to Winter or in that region but the 10th   regiment swore that they had started for Salt Lake and they would go there   The Capt. told them we should not let them come in and they would find a   different warefare from anything they had met with    The Mountain Meddow Massacre    On the 29th of September Elder John D Lee arrived from Harmony with an express  and an awful tale of blood. A company of Californian emigrants of about 150   men women and children many of them belonging to the mobbers of Missouri   and Illinois had been massacred. They had many cattle and horses with   them aAs they travelled along South they went damning Brigham Young Heber  C Kimball and the heads of the Church saying that Joseph Smith ought to have   been shot long before he was. They wanted to do all the evil they could   so they poisoned beef and gave it to the Indians and some of them died. They   poisoned the springs of water and several of the Saints died. The Indians became   enraged at their conduct and they surrounded them on a Prairie and the emigrants   formed a bulwark of their waggons; but the Indians fought them five days   until they killed all their men about 60 in number. They then rushed into   the correll and cut the throats of their woman and children except for some 8 or   10 children which they brought and sold to the whites    The Indians stripped the men and women naked   and left them stinking in the boiling sun. When brother Lee found it out   he took some men and went and buried their bodies. It was a horrid job  The whole air was filled with an awful stench. Manay of the men and   women were rotten with the foul disease before they were hurt by the Indians  The Indians obtained all their property cattle horses and guns &c    Their was another large company of emigrants who   had 1000 head of cattle who was also damning both Indians and Mormons  They were afraid of sharing the same fate. Brother Lee had to send   interpreters with them to the Indians to try to save their lives while at the   same time they were trying to kill us.

This offer was made for the poor at the request of  Brigham Young    President Kimball moved that President Young himself  and J. M. Grant should go into the mountains and to meet the  companies and bring them in. The vote was put to the people and  but few voted for it but the great majority against it    President Young spoke of the necessary of a  reformation among the people    President Kimball called upon the blacksmiths  in the congregation to return home to mend the wagons and  shoe the horses of the people so that they might start back  upon their expedition to help in the companies.    The authorities of the Church were then presented  by President Kimball and sustained    The 18th Ward was divided and John Sharp  was appointed Bishop to preside over the Twentieth Ward    Presidents Grant and Kimball addressed the  congregation and President Young then said    "I wish to fulfil the promise which I made  two weeks ago. I then told the people or the females that  I would release them at Conference. I will do so on certain  conditions and that is that you will appear forthwith at my  Office and give good and sufficient reasons and then marry  men who will not have but one wife.    In the afternoon the returned Elders Cyrus  H. Waheelock James Ferguson Wm C Dunbar Elder Bunker 
 We spent most of this day getting the brethren ready to go   into the Mountains.    Brother Brigham while speaking of the cutting of the throats of   women and children as the Indians had done South said that it was   heartrending that emigration must stop as he before said    Brother Lee remarked that he did not think that   there was a drop of innocent blood in the camp of the emigrants who   were slain by the Indians. He had two of the surviving children   and he could get but one to kneel in prayer time and the other would   laugh at her for doing it and the^y^ would sware like pirates    An express came in at night saying that the troops were   near Bridger and had formed into three bodies in travelling. General   Wells sent word for the brethren to let them come on to Ecko Kanyon   and there give them battle.    At 6 o'clock on the morning of the 30th the drums beat   and an army of soldiers paraded the streets some 400 who were in   readiness to march at a moments notice to the seat of war. We had at this   time about 800 men in the mountains. It was a solemn time the   armies of the Gentiles were making war upon us because of our religion and   we had to defend ourselves against a nation of 25,000,000 people and   the war had just commenced. We had to trust in God for the   result. We were resolved to do thewhat we could and leave the work   in His hands. There was a solemnity resting upon our city   this morning; all were anxiously awaiting the arrival of the express  I told President Young that I was on hand at any moment to go into   the mountains when he would say the word. I went up in the   evening to the President's Office and learned that the California mail   had arrived. I heard some letters read, one stating that the Government  had made arrangements to send up light drauht boats up the   Colorado river with men and arms against us from that point    Next morning October the 1st I arose early   and looked for an express signal flag but saw none. There 
 and Charles ^acy^ G. Webb.    President Young said he had never heard any  missionaries speak on returning from missions that he was more   satisfied with than with those who had just returned home; though  he was as well satisfied with the Twelve on their mission to  England in 1840    Next day I spoke to the people upon the Handcart  companies; John Banks followed upon his mission East and President  Grant delivered a brief but powerful address on reformation    Repaptism of F. D Richards and Others.    At the close of the meeting I went to the Font and the House  of the Lord to assist in baptism and confirmation.    Elder Franklin D Richards went into the  Font and baptized his brethren the missionaries who had been  with him and their families and Elder Lorenzo Snow and   myself confirmed them. ^About 65.^    On the 7th Conference was called to order by  President Kimball who rebuked those who were in the habit  of leaving during service or talking at meeting and he said    "You may say I am severe. I am not  half as severe as the Lord wants me to be. I have seen  Joseph when men were in Council meetings with him and  rose to leave cut them off from the Church before they got  out of the door. You tramel the Spirit and it is grieved  with the confusion and interuption. If you do not believe  this get the Spirit of God and come on this stand and  attempt to talk to the people    During the day a number of the  Returned Missionaries spoke and it was resolved that  the Returned Missionaries should stay with their families 
 was a good deal of anxity through the day waiting for an express    In the latter part of the day I called at the President's   Office and found President Brigham Young Heber C Kimball Albert Carrington   George D. Grant and William Kimball and an Express arrived from Col Little   giving an account of the number of soldiers which were with him and about Echo   Kanyon. As soon as we had got through reading his letter an express  arrived from General D. H. Wells J. Taylor and G. A. Smith sent by Joseph  A Young and Joseph ^James W.^ Cummings saying that they had sent an express to the  United States army containing governor Young's orders for them to surrender  all their arms and baggage to Lewis Robinson Quarter Master General  at Fort Bridger or to retreat back to the States or we should resist them  The U.S. army was encamped on Ham's Fork. The Brethren were  waiting an answer to their message and would send an express in as  soon as they got it.    I spent the 5th in the President's Office. He heard a part   of the account of the death of Joseph by John Taylor. He said what  there was necessary to put into Joseph's History and the rest to go as John  Taylor's History.    General Conference  October th[e] 6th    Our Conference this year of course was very materially thrown out of  its amout of business and importance by the circumstances of the war  against the Saints and the number of our brethren in the Mountains to  defend our cause our people and our homes. The Conference lasted   two days and then closed. The time was mostly occupied by the   Missionaries and the Twelve and President Young spoke at the close  of the meetings of the Conference    Lot Smith Burns U.S. Waggons.    On the 8th we got an express saying that a company under  Lot Smith had burned up 50 of the Government waggons and 
 while they were burning General Harney and his cavalry came up. Lot Smith's   company had gone East to burn up what they could. It was thought   that there would be decided action soon    On the 13th the brethren came in from the East and   brought in 153 head of cattle. Three teamsters and one deserter from   the army helped to drive them in. The deserter reported that   neither Johnson Harney nor the Governor or Judges nor any of the Territorial   officers had arrived at the army nor any females. He said the   soldiers were only allowed 3 buiscuts 2 cups of coffee and a small piece   of beef per day and that they were not half fed. He said they had   75 waggons burned and the contents of 76. Two waggons were   saved. Captain Lot Smith saved all the private property of the  teamsters and when the waggons were burned they gave back the   teamsters all their arms amunition &c. One brother had his knee   shattered by the accidental discharge of a yawger. They had   to carry him on a litter a long distance. He suffered much   with it.    The Sanpete company arrived in the city on the 12^14^th   comprising 100 men and 11 baggage waggons. They marched five   men abreast. Col Rockwood informed ^me^ that there were 1100 men   of our soldiers in the Mountains and 700 camped on the Public Square   and that we could raise 1500 hmen in this city. iIn 15 hours we could   place 3000 armed men in Echo Kanyon    An express arrived at 25 minuted to 6 o'clock   brought by Brother Joseph ^A^ Young Jr. Benjamen Stringham   brought ^a letter^ from General Wells stating that numbers of the U.S.  army wished to desert and come into the Valley if they had protection   The army was weakning daily. The chief officers sent a very polite   note to Governor Young acknowledging the receipt of the Deseret News   which he had sent them.    Captain Lot Smith had gone East upon his   mission in watching for the interest of Utah. The enemy 
 were mostly hemed in but no disposition manifest to shed blood on e[i]ther  side. The enemy were in a close place and their provisions fast diminishing   and but little prospects before them but starvation. We had prayed that   the Lord would lead them into the pit which they had dug for the Saints   and the Lord had heard our prayers and our enemies were now in the pit   and a fair prospect of their being destroyed without our shedding their blood    Letters From Col Alexander to President Young  Oct 16th    An express arrived this morning bringing a letter from Col Alexander   to Governor Young concerning the present state of affairs also a letter   from General Wells.    The brethren had taken a herd of cattle of 700 head and   were bringing them in. It was reported in the army that Col. Johnson   would soon be up with 700 cavalry but this was uncertain    Col Alexander's letter was rather severe and   threatened us with extermination if we opposed. He considered himself   able to come in and carry out the commands of the Government.  Governor Young sent him a strong answer asking him why he stayed   in camp on Hams Fork for a month if he considered he had force   enough to carry out his orders. He gave him to understand that it   was now the Kingdom of God and the Kingdom of the Devil and we   trusted in God for success and should go ahead    In turning from this subject to little children President   Young said when some people have little children born at 6 or seven months   from pregnancy and they live a few hours and then die they bless them   name them &c but I dont do it for I think that such a spirit will have   a chance of occupying another Tabernacle and develop^ing^ itself. This is   new doctrine, yet it looks consistant. What period of demarcation   or age the spirit would take another body we were not informed.    Sunday the 18th we met in the Tabernacle and heard   The Correspondence of Col. Alexander to Governor Young 
 The correspondence was very rich and edifying. President Young then   preached to the assembly in a very profitable manner. He said he   should prepare for the worse^t^ and should have grain casched where the   enemy could not find it and be prepared to move into the mountains and   burn all. Yet he believed we could keep our enemies out and still raise   crops in the Valley. He was followed by brother Kimball who said   that he knew that if we would hearken to counsel that we should raise   grain eat peache^s^ and apples and live in our houses in the Valleys   until we went to Jackson County. President Young said I believe it    An Express arrived at 1 P.M of the 18th and   brought a letter to President Young from Daniel H. Wells and one to me   from George A. Smith. They informed us of an    An Adventure of Captain Lot Smith    who with his company came near being caught in a trap by the enemy in   the following manner. About daybreak they came near the enemy's   camp and thought they saw a drove of mules a distance from the camp  They made a charge upon them to stampede them but as they rushed   in among them they found they were mounted dragoons. The   captain of the company sulated [saluted] and said Captain Smith you cannot   see very good this morning. Captain Smith replied I can see as   well as you can with your blind bridles on. They looked at each   other awhile then Lot Smith trotted off at a slow pace but the enemy   tried to surround them and they had to gallop over a very rough place   to get away. When they got about 30 rods away the enemy dismounted   and took a dead rest and shot about 30 bullets at them. One ball passed   through one of the brethren's hats and another ball grazed a horse's leg   That was all the damage which was done. This was the first   firing on either side and this was done by our enemies; but no   blood was shed except it was the blood of a horse's leg.    Col. Burton with a company of dragoons or 
 minute men arrived in this city in good health and spirits. President Kimball   addressed them a short time and said by virtue of the office which I hold I   bless you in the name of the Lord and if you will live your religion and do right   you shall none of you fall by the hand of an enemy but you shall eat peaches   and apples in this Valley until you go to Jackson County Missouri and your enemies   shall not conquer you. Keep your guns and firelocks in good order and do not   waste your ammunition for naught. It is not a day for much preaching   but a day for hard service. This is not much that we have to meet with this   fall but next year we must be prepared for work. General Grant followed   with few words and told them where to go for quarters and they went to their   various places allotted them    October the 21st brother Atwood arrived in the morning   bringing an express from General Wells and 2 letters from Col Alexander   who closed his letter by saying that "he should not obey the Governor's orders   and his final disposal of the troops would depend upon grave considerations   which I do not deem necessary to enumerate."    The messenger said that the 5th regiment had   stopped near Bevear River in tents and the 10th regiment had moved   back on Hams Fork five miles with all their teams and baggage  The were in the snow several inches deep. The brethren travelled   several miles with the army. The men were so weak and cold   they would wrap up in their coats and lie down in the snow to rest   almost every mile.    We could not tell what the intentions of the officers   were. President Young was of an opinion that Col Alexander's   intention was to come nearer our camp so that his men might desert   Col. Robert Burton said that it was 80 miles from Alexander's   command to the mouth of Echo Kanyon. President Young said "here   are the officers around me and I will call a council of war. He then   said:    "I think it is best for General Wells to call in all his forces to   Echo Kanyon and there rest and not ride his horses to death unnecessarily 
 but let the enemy alone now and they will soon use themselves up. Keep   a few to watch their movements and let them work and they will   soon all be used up.    Dr Hickman was with the 5th regiment and   Allen and his companions with the 10th regiment. Heber C. Kimball  Jr sent Col Alexander a doz. onions and the Col. said that if he   had anything that Heber wanted he would send it to him. He   asked Beaty why he tryed to stampede their animals and burn   the grass. He said "we burn the grass to get a better crop next   year.    On this day the 21st some 700 or 800 head of cattle were drove   into the city taken from the U.S. army. They were accompanied   by some teamsters and soldiers who looked poor and hungry.    President Young's Veiws of the Way to Conquer the Saints    In conversation on the 24th upon the events of the time President   Young said he was satisfied that we could live in this Valley and   raise crops and keep our enemies out. It is not in their power to   overthrow us. By the help of God we can remain here and they cannot   conquer us. I have reflected this over in my mind to see what   way I could conquer this people if I was there; and I cannot see but one   way and that way they will not attempt to take. The United States   have spent three millions of dollars this season to fit out an army to destroy   us and it has done us no harm. But if I was going to attempt   to destroy this people I should have let them have their Post Office made   one million dollars of appropriation given them all they asked for then spent   another million in carrying in Gentiles and merchandize and kept this up   yearly until I had filled the country with Gentiles but the Lord would   not let them do this. I should know I could not conquer them   by force and they will find it out    President Young got a letter to-day from Gen Wells   who said the enemy have returned back on Ham's Fork some 15 miles 
 On the 25th Elders John Taylor and George A Smith arrived from the   head quarters of the army and met in council with us. President Young upon   the subject of the war said I mean to send word to the United States that if they   have sent troops here the cattle which we have taken I will give them credit for upon   compound interest but I do not know that they have sent any. They have not   notified me officially and I have not right to know anything about it but shall   treat them as a mob    On the 26th Brother Peter ^W^ Conover and Oliver Smith arrived and   called upon President Young with news from our Carson Valley company   The Carson Valley Saints and those from California and Oregon were on their   way to this City. They had 160 fighting men with 2700 lbs of   amunition belonging to the Church with a great deal of private property  and a large amount of arms. All the Saints were coming from Carson   Valley. They left only 2 boxes of caps and 1 lb of powder in all Carson   Valley. The people sold all their arms and amunition to the brethren   for their places    President Young received a letter from General Grant. The U.S.   army were still on Hams Fork and had not decided which route they would   take. Our brethren had got the chief waggon master in custody    The Presidency and Twelve were in conversation all the   forenoon at his office on the subject of the war. President Young said   that the United States Government were loosing their national greatness,   and wisdom was departing from them. We need not ^have^ as much need  to fear ^of^ them as we should ^of^ an army of grashoppers. If they take   away our charter from us and divide our Territory it will be unconstitutional   as everything is which they do against us. I told brother Bernhisel  that if they took away our Charter to come immediately home as soon   as he could and we would organize our State Government and   fall back upon our original boundaries. Our East boundary should   be as far as Laramie and our West boundary the summit of the   Siere Nevada and run to the Pacific Ocean and we would   defend it. The United States may do as they please. We will 
 do as the Lord wants us.    One young officer of the army said that old Jesus Christ   could not keep him out of  Salt Lake City but they will find out who rules on   earth and in the heavens. Another officer said the United States   would wipe us out another year. Should they send an army of 20,000 men   it would take more than 20 miles for their army and train to move  at all and the more there is of them the worse off they will be.    Brother Taylor said will not the army go into   Winter Quarters and entrench themselves and remain until they get help   from the States? President Young said if an army comes to help   them in the Spring we will use them up this army first and then we will  us[e] up the other before wthe^y^ get to the South Pass. In the Spring we   must ask Alexander what he intends to do, inform him that he must   not stay there until he gets reinforcements in the Spring and if they will not   leave in the Spring ^we^ will use them up as best we can in ten days. We   can put two thousand men around them who cwould soon use them   up. I do not believe they will have 500 fighting men in the   Spring. They are in a very critical situation. I think it is   better to let them alone this Winter. They will die many of them   and others desert and many be weakened with the scurvey and in the   Spring we will wipe them out if necesary if they dont go away.   We do all our business in the name of Israel's God and they in   their own way. The whole matter can be sumed up in these   few words. We are here at home by our own fireside while they are   a great way from home. I intend to send those teamsters to the   South where they cannot get back to the army.    By express on the 28th we learned that   the enemy had not moved for several days but were waiting   for Col Johnson to come up with four companies of cavalry and   two companies of infantry. This however was but from report   and not authority    It was decided in council that General Wells John Taylor 
 Elder Woodruff wanted the Elders to remember in their   travels that there was a printing press in Nauvoo, that it is in   the hands of the church, & it is wished that the Elders would get   Subscribers for the papers, & pay collect pay for them & forward it  to the Editor, in cash, & not spend the money & then pay in   [Conblin's] Labor, cayenne pepper, & old clouts. and when the Elders   build up churches they are requested to write a brief statemets of   the facts & forward them to the Editor.—post fee.— & 
 Elder W. Woodruff arose and addressed the Assembly   from Amos ##Amos 3:7|3 ch. 7 v.## "'Surely the Lord God will do nothing   but he revealeth thehis secret unto his servants the prophets.'  Aaccording to the testimony of the scriptures in all ages of the   world, whenever God was about to bring a judgment upon the   world or accomplish any great work, the first thing he did   was to raise up a Prophet, and reveal unto him histhe secretts, and   send him to warn the people so that they may be left without excuse.  This was the case in the days of Noah and Lot:  God was about   to bring judgments upon the people, and he raised up a ^those^ prophets,  and ^who^ warned them ^people^ of it; yet they gave no heed to them, but rejected   their testimony; and the judgments came upon  those ^the people^ so that they   were destroyed, while the prophets were saved by pursuing the   cours marked out by the Lord. [##Genesis 6##] Jesus Christ testified to the   Jews of the things that awaited them as a nation—the fall of   Jerusalem, and their dispersion among the Gentile world; but they   did not believe it.  Yet the secret of all these things were revealed  to the Prophets and Apostles; and they believed it, and looked for   its fulfilment; and it came to pass as it was predicted, though   contrary to the expectation of the Jewish nation.  In like manner   do we look for the certain fulfilment of those tremendous events   upon the heads of the Gentile world, which have been spoken of,  and pointed out by all the Holy Prophets and Apostles since the   world began, they having spoken as they were moved upon by the   Power of God and the gift of the Holy Ghost: events which more   deeply concern the Gentile world, than the overthrow of Jerusalem  and the dispersion of the Jews did the Jewish nation; for while 
 17    they stumbled at the stone they were broken, but when it falls   upon the heads of the gentile world it will grind them to powder. & and  The full set time is come for the Lord to set his hand to accomplish   these mighty events, and ^as^ he has done as he in other ages, so has  he done now—he has raised up a prophet, and is revealing unto   him his secrets: through that prophet he has brought to light the fulness   of the everlasting gospel to the present generation, and is again once   more for the last time establishing his Church upon the foundation   of the Ancient Apostles and Prophets, Jesus Christ being the   chief corner stone.  In the Church is now found Judges as at   the first, and Councillors as at the beginning; the Church is composed   of ^also^ Apostles,  Prophets, ^Evangelists^, Pastors, and Teachers, ^with^ gifts and grace, for   the perfecting of the saints, the work of the ministry, and the edifying   of the body of Christ.  The Lord has raised up his servants,  and sent them into the vineyard ^to prune it^ once more for the last time—  to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ, and to warn the nations that   they may be left without excuse in the day of their visitation;   also to gather the honest in heart, and the meek of the earth, that   Zion may be built up, and ^the sayings of^ the prophets fulfilled.    One of the secrets that God has revealed unto his prophet in  these days is the Book of Mormon; and it was a secret to the   whole world until it was revealed unto Joseph Smith, whom God   has raised up as a Prophet, Seer, and Revelator unto his people.  This record contains an account of the Ancient inhabitants of   this continent, and of the cities with which they overspread this land   from sea to sea, the ruins of which still remain as standing mon-  uments of the arts, science, power and greatness of their inhab ^founders^.    It also points out the establishing of this our own nation, with   its progress, decline, and fall; and those predictions contained   in the Book of Mormon—the stick of Joseph in the hand of Ephraim—   will as truly be fulfilled as those contained in the bible—the   stick and record of Judah; and both these sticks or records   contain prophecies of great import concerning the gentile nations,  and especially this land and nation, which are not yet fulfilled,  but must shortly come to pass; yea, their fulfillment is nigh even 
 at the doors. [##Ezekiel 37:15-20##]    Though the secrets which God is revealing through his servant   the Prophet in these last days may be unpopular, and unbelieved   in by the world, yet their unbelief will not make the truth of God   of none effect any more than it did in the days of Lot and Noah,  or at the fall of Jerusalem. When Jesus Christ said there should   not be left one stone upon another in the Temple that should not   be thrown down, the Jewish neation did not believe it, neither   would they receive such testimony; but they looked at outward   circumstances, and were ready to say, "who can prevail against us?  What nation like ^unto^ our nation? We have held the giving of the law,  the articles, ^&^ the Urim and Thummim; the Lawgiver has never departed   from between our feet: we have held the power of government from  generation to generation; and what nation hath power now to   prevail against us?" [##Matthew 24:1-2##] Through the order of reasoning they were   blinded, and knew not the day of their visitation—they understood   not the things that belonged to their peace—they rejected their Lord  and King, contended against his word and testimony, and finally   put him to death on the cross, with many who followed him. But   this did not hinder the fulfillment of the  his predictions concerning   that nation; the words of the Lord had gone forth out of his mouth,   and could not return unto him void. The things that belonged to   their peace were hid from their eyes, and they were counted unworthy   as a nation; the Kingdom was to be rent out of their hands, and   given to another; the die was cast, and judgment must come.    Jerusalem was soon surrounded by the Roman Army, led   on by the inspired Titus; and a scene of calamity, judgment   and woe immediately overspread ^the inhabitants of^ that city which was devoted to   destruction—such a calmity as never before rested upon the nation   of Israel. Blood flowed through their streets, tens of thousands  fell by the edge of the sword, and thousands by famine. Women   were evil towards the Children of their own bosoms in the straitness   of the seige, the spectacle of which shocked the Roman soldiers  as they entered the city. The Jews were crucified in such   numbers by their enemies that they could find no more wood 
 19    for crosses, or room for their bodies; and while despair was in   every face, and every heart sinking while suffering under the   chastening hand of God, their enemies rushed upon them in the city   to strike the last fatal blow; and as their last resort, they   rushed ^for safety^ into the Temple, which was soon on fire, and they   sunk in the midst of the flames with the cry of their sufferings   ascending up on high, accompanied by the smoke of the crackling   ^spires and^ towers. The remaining miserable few were sold as slaves, and   driven like the dumb ass before his burthen, and scattered   as corn is sifted in a seive, throughout the gentile world.    Jerusalem was razed from its foundations, the ^ruins of the^ Temple thrown   down, and the foundation thereof plowed up that not one   stone was left upon another. Christ said that Jerusalem should   be trodden down of the gentiles until the times of the gentiles   be fulfilled, which has been the case to the very letter   until the present generation. Will not God in like manner   as truly and faithfully bring to pass those great, important,  and tremendous events upon the heads of the gentile world, which   have been proclaimed by the Prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel,   Daniel, and many of the ^other^ Holy Prophets; also by Christ and the   Apostles on the continent of Asia, as well as ^by^ Lehi, Nephi, Alma,   Moroni, and others on this continent?; all of whom have proclaimed   these things as they were moved upon by the spirit of inspiration,  the power of God, and the gift of the Holy Ghost?    The Apostle says that no prophecy of the scriptures is of any   private interpretation, and the commandments ^came not^ of olden time by   the will of man, but holy men of God spake as they were moved   upon by the Holy Ghost. Isaiah's soul seemed to be on fire,   and his mind wrapt in the visions of the Almighty, while he   declared in the name of the Lord that it should come to pass  in the last days that God should set his hand again the second   time to recover the remnant of his people, assemble the outcasts   of Israel, gather together the dispersed of Judah, destroy the   tongue of the Egyptian sea and make men go over dry shod, gather  them to Jerusalem on horses, mules, swift beasts, and in chariots, [##Isaiah 11:11-15##] 
 20    and rebuild Jerusalem upon her own heaps; while at the same time   the destruction destroyer of the Gentiles will be on his way; and   while God was turning the captivity of Israel, he would put all   their curses and afflictions upon the heads of the gentiles their enemies,  who had not sought to recover but to destroy them, and had trodden  them under foot from generation to generation. At the same time   the standard should be lifted up, that the honest in heart, the meek  of the earth among the gentiles should seek unto it; and that Zion   should be redeemed, and be built up a Holy City, that the glory   and power of God should rest upon her, and be seen upon her; that   the watchman upon Mount Ephraim might cry, "arise ye and   let us go up unto  the Zion, the City of the Lord our God"; [##Jeremiah 31:6##] that the   gentiles might come to her light, and kings to the brightness of   her rising; that the saints of God may have a place to flee to  and stand in holy places while judgment works in the earth; that   when the sword of God that is bathed in heaven falls upon Idumea   or the world[##Isaiah 34:5##]—when the Lord pleads with all flesh by sword and   by fire, and the slain of the Lord are many—the saints may   escape these calamities by fleeing to the places of refuge like  Lot and Noah.    Isaiah in his ##Isaiah 24|24 ch.## gives something of an account of the calamities  and judments which shall come upon the heads of the gentile nations, and   this because they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinances, and   broken the everlasting covenant. The Apostle Paul says to his Roman  brethren that if the gentiles do not continue in the goodness of God,  they like the House of Israel should be cut off. Though Babylon   says, "I sit as a queen and ty am no widow, and shall see no   sorrow", the Revelator says, "therefore shall her plagues come in one   day; death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly   burned with fire, for strong is the Lord God who judgeth her". [##Revelation 18:2-8##] Jesus   communicated the ##Luke 13:6-9|parable of the fig tree## which in putting forth its   leaves betokens the approach of summer; and so likewise when we   see the signs in the sun, moon and stars, and in the heavens and the   earth of which he spoke, we might know that his coming is near—  that the generation in which those signs appeared should not pass ^away^ 
 until all should be fulfilled.    These things are about to come to pass upon the heads of the   present generation, notwithstanding they are not looking for it,   neither do they believe it; yet their unbelief will not make the   truth of God of none effect; the signs are appearing in the heavens,   and on the earth, and all things indicate the fulfilment of the   Prophets; the fig tree is leavfing, summer is nigh, and the Lord   has sent his angels to lay the foundation of this great and important   work. Then why should not God reveal his secrets unto his   servants the Prophets, that the saints might be led in paths of   safety, and escape those evils which are about to engulf a   whole generation in rain. 
 The people again assembld at 6 oclok oclock in the evening  prayer by Orson  Pratt W. Wooduff addresed the people & spoke of the great variety that   was manifest in all the works of God both in heaven & on earth which addded greatly  to the interest & glory of God but all governed by the same spirit, power &  Law, so with the preaching of the Elders of this church, they treat upon a   great many of subjects but all by the same spirit & unto edification exhorted  parents to see that their children stored their minds with useful   reading, esspecially with the prophesies & revelation of God, that any person  who studies the Bible Book of Mermon & Doctrine & Co[v]enants thoroughly   will be far more prepared to follow the Living Oracles & obey ther Council   than one who does not. Even Jesus Christ when he descended frm Heaven   into the midst of the Nephites He spent most of his time in preaching whole  chapters out of the scriptures to them. Exhorted the Elders to keep a journal   & Hisory of the Dealings of God with them. Requested the young men to  become thoroughly acquainted with Phonography that they might become   reporters to record the great things that God would manifest unto them   in various ways in there day & generation. exort Exhorted the people to give   heed to the strong teaching & council which they had received during this   conference.  many other remarks were made & subjects refered to by the   speaker    A few closing remarks were made by Elder Orson Pratt. 
 After devotional exercises, brother Allen W. Woodruff addressed the  Conference. He was pleased to meet with a Conference of the Saints  for the first time in this Territory. Read from the Doctrine and  Covenants part of a revelation given to Thomas B. Marsh con-  cerning the Twelve. He never met with the Saints in Conference  but vwhat he reflected upon the position they occupied with theier God  each other and the world. We little comprehended the responsi-  bilities that rests upon us as Apostles, seventies, elders and saints.  Every prophet from father Adam down had spoken of this great  last dispensation. Adam 3 years before his death spoke of all  that should transpire untill the millenium. [##Doctrine and Covenants 107:53##] Isaiah had written  our history in coming up to these mountains. The Lord has  reserved spirits to tabernacle in this last dispensation. Abraham  was chosen to stand at the head of Israel. [##Genesis 12:1-3##] Has the Lord set his  hand to build up this kingdom at random? No. God had  reserved spirits to come forth in this last dispenseation. Joseph  Smith was reserved to open it up, and the apostles, seventies  and hundreds of others had been kept back in the spirit world  for 6000 yeears to come forth at this time. Others were inspired  to do their part in starting certain principles or perform  certain works, such as Calvin, Columbus and the establishers  of this free and independent government. When the Gospel came  to the world it took one of a family and two of a city and   the the hand of God was in this. We recieved the priesthood in  the spirit world, now has come our time, and what has God  for us to do? What manner of men had we ought to be. Refer-  rel to Moses day, how few men held the priesthood in his  day, now 999 of every 1000 of the males in the Church holds 
 — 2 —  the priesthood, either Melchisedek or Aaronic. These have  the Gospel to preach to thier fellow men. Spoke of his own  labors, and of the apostles and elders in this respect. Joseph  Smith, Brigham Young and the elders would judge this gen-  eration. Joseph Smith had sealed his testimony with his  blood and went into the spirit world to unlock the prison  doors. Referred to the twelve fulfilling the revelation, requir-  ing them to take leave of the saints in Far West, on the 26th  day of April 1839. After fulfilling this mission the lorddevil  laid his hand upon them, ^tried to hedge up their way,^ but after having got on the  water on their way to England, he left them and they went  forth and brought many to a knowledge of the truth. After  awhile the Lord revealed the law for the redemption of the  dead, and they went forth rejoicing in it, but soon after  the Lord said for them to keep a record, and not to  have males baptized for females &c. Joseph had conferred  the keys of the priesthood which he held upon the twelve,  The people were called upon to build temples and when  we get an oppertunity we should redeem our dead. He then  spoke upon the sealing ordinance, how we Lords of creation  waked up one morning without any wives or children,  and the Lord revealed the laws of the Celestial Glory to Joseph Smith  and the Lord says to the apostles and elders obey this law or  you will be damned. All the heavenly host are gazing  upon this congregation, and the saints living in these  mountains to see what we are going to do. Spoke of the Laman-  ites and the work we have to perform among them and how  thier minds had been changed from war to peace. We are  called upon to build up Zion, we have to cultivate our fields,  and build our houses, fences, ditches, &c. this pertains to it  and we can not do it all in one day. Zion will continue  to grow. The priesthood should not set their heart upon  temporal matters, or the things of this world, and no one  should use the priesthood to build themselves up in this  worlds goods. We ought to dedicate our labors, our fields,   &c, and ourselves unto the Lord. We have been called upon 
 — 3 —  to enter into the United Order as near as we could The apos-  ltes have felt we would have to come to this. He liked what he  saw in these two settlements (Sunset and Brigham City)  and said God bless us, and would feel under condemnation  as an elder if he should say to us stay your hand, and un-  till the Lord reveals a better plan. he said go ahead. He  then referred to how much less chance there is for temptation  in this way of being united in our farming and living together  and when men were called on missions, thier families would  not be left in want to suffer, but would be provided for;  the same with men who died. He was only a visitor here  and did not pretend particularly to dictate or direct his  brethren that were called upon to preside here. We had his   prayers in our behalf. 
 Brother Allen ^W Woodruff^ said Zion is going to spread forth. He  had seen the persecutions the Saints had passed through, yet  Zion had not gone backward. The Lord will cut his work short  in righteousness. Let every man offer up his prayers to the  Lord of Sabaoth, and when 100,000 elders offer up thier prayers  in faith, they will not go unanswered. We have the Lord on  our side. Was glad to hear of the spirit of union among  us. The earth is our home and we should so live that  we will be prepared to live, upon it when it becomes  sanctified. May the Lord bless the children who are  growing up, who never saw babylon. Counselled the young  to marry when they were old enough. 
 Brother Allen ^W. Woodruff^ said the Lord had chosen the weak things  of the earth to confound the wisdom of the world. Spoke upon  the erroneous ideas of the world regarding God. Thisere is but  one Gospel revealed for the salvation of the human family.  Joseph Smith knew the principles he brought forth were not  of himself but of God. If we build up Zion or administer in  any of the ordinances, it is by the gift and power of God. There  is no difference between an apostle, seventy or elder in this age  from any other age, to preach the Gospel. The apostles and great  men were chosen from those who walked in the most humble 
 walks of life. The Savior will come when even the Saints  look not for. Let us unite together and carry out the coun-  sels we have heard. Spoke upon the education of our  children. The mothers of Israel should pray and learn their  children to pray, and our children should grow up full  of faith. The aposles and elders are passing off, and the  responsibility of bearing off this Kingdom would rest upon  the rising generation. Every one would recieve the Glory he  lived for. He would like to be asociated with Adam and  all the great and good men, when he leaves this world. Our  object is to work for our own salvation and the salvation of  our fellow men, and we need the spirit of the Lord to guide  us safe through. Let us labor while the day lasts. Desired  the Lord to bless those called to preside over us, and those who  were called to labor in the priesthood and the parents and  children. 
 Elder Lewis Allen ^Apostle W. Woodruff^ was pleased to meet with his brethren and sisters in  conference. President Young had said the Latter-day Saints would yet need  homes in Arizona. Had accomplished in Utah what we have by the  blessings of God and by faith and so we would in this land. We are  blessed here and hoped we would keep our minds on the business of  this meeting and leave out all outside matters from us. There is great  enmity among the children of men against the people of God, notwith-  standing this, those who fear God and keep his commandments are a  blessed people but those who are not of us will hate us. In reading the  history of the world we find that 1/4 of the inhabitants of the earth have been  slain in battle, and about 3 years in 4 been occupied in war, and the  Lord will destroy the wicked by war. Zion will rise and Babylon  will fall. It is a marvel that we enjoy the peace we do from the out-  side world. Showed how Enoch and others had been persecuted. In coming  into the mountains we have fulfilled the predictions of ancient prophets.  Councelor W. C. Allen reported St. Joseph ward. The saints felt first late  and felt encouraged in living together in the United Order. Had enough  to do to keep out of mischief and are striving to work on a principle  that will make them self sustaining. He wanted to try to live honest and  upright before the Lord. We would not get credit in the next world for  our houses, cattle and lands, but for being obedient to the priesthood and  the Lord. 
 Elder Lewis Allen ^Apostle W. Woodruff^ remarked whenever you saw a man whose religion  was in his clothes you need not look for it anywhere else. 
 Apostle W. Woodruff  Elder Lewis Allen said it was a great satisfaction to hear the testimo-  nies of the brethren.  There is a vail between us and the Lord, but there  is none between the Lord and us, and it is thus to try us and prove  us.  The eyes of the Lord are over us and our works.  Spoke of Job's  patience.  We shall be held to account for the use of the gifts endowed  upon us.  The Lord will sweep the wicked off from the face of  the earth.  There is not a crime that could be named but what this  nation is guilty of.  In his boyhood he was anxious to live upon the  earth when God had the priesthood upon it, and he had lived to behold  it.  We shall never be driven from these mountains, but we shall  enlarge our borders and extend the Stakes of Zion.  The Lord does  not depend upon numbers to accomplish His purposes.  We should  build up Zion and the judgements will fall upon the wicked.    -4-    We are living in an important time.  This nation and its officers  will soon have something else to do than to chase the elders of  Israel around.  If the Lord has any friends upon the earth it is in  these mountains. 
 Apostle W. Woodruff  Elder Lewis Allen then said there are certain principles which never  become old with us.  He a then read from the book of Mormon, Alma XIX  chapter, commencing with the 5th paragraph.  There is an eternal variety  in the world.  He desired the same body in the resurrection as he now had  and he expected it, and we would all have the same bodies in the resurrec-  tion and he rejoiced in it.  The company we keep here we will keep in the  world to come.  You show me what a man sows in this life and I will  show you what he will reap in the world to come.  Referred to the dark-  ness that beclouded the minds of the people outside of the Latter-day Saints  Is there a happier people than the Latter-day Saints?  No.  The saints of  God are few yet we can afford to endure persecution and those who  oppose us will go to hell.  As long as the saints will let the Holy Spirit  guide them, there is no danger of them falling into the dark.  Every  man who holds the priesthood will be sorry for every sin he commits.  We should be kind to our wives and children and to one another.  He   was thankful he was born in this generation.  He had been through  a great many hard places but his life has been preserved and felt  to give the glory to God.  How long he would be permitted to live he  did not know.  Let us serve the Lord and pray to God.  Every one who  bears the priesthood are entittled to the spirit of revelation and we should  listen to the whisperings of the still small voice.  The revelations to this  people are true.  It was pleasing to see us living in the United Order,  and if all the saints would live in this manner, sinners in Zion    -5-    would tremble, and fear would come upon the hypocrite.  He did not  feel to forsake any of the commandments of God, for the sake of ac-  commodating those who are going to hell or to a nation steeped in sin  and iniquity.  Let us go upward and let our aim be for the Celes-  tial Kingdom.   
 At 7 o-clock p.m. the saints met together, where elders S. G. Ladd,  Isaac Turley, B.Y. Perkins H.M. Tanner and W.R. Tenney bore thier testimonies  and were followed by Elder Lewis Allen ^Apostle W. Woodruff^ who spoke in a most instructive  manner, giving his experience in the ministry and exhorted us to labor  for the redemption of the remnants of the house of Israel upon this land,  saying the time has come when the Lord will pour out his Spirit upon them and they will  soon go forth in this nation and tread down the wicked as a young lion among  lambs.  He also gave instructions with regard to the missionaries sent among them, that  they should travel and preach. 
 Elder Lewis Allen ^Apostle W. Woodruff^ said we should practice what we preach.  Babylon will fall and he wanted the saints to encourage home man-  ufactures.  We should lay up our wheat, and what we cannot  manufacture ourselves let us do without.  By our pursuing this  course we will have the blessings of the Lord upon us.  Those who  are not for us are against us, and we should be watchful and not betray  our brethren. 
 Apostle W. Woodruff said he was glad to see the improvement  made here among the Saints.  We should meet together and dedicate  our fields.  The Latter-day Saints should keep the word of wisdom.  The day will come when no man will be permitted to administer the  sacrament or officiate in the ordinances of the Church who does not  keep the word of wisdom.  No man is fit to administer the sacrament,  lay hands on the sick, or officiate in temples with tobacco in his  mouth or whisky in his system, and it should not be permitted,  it is not acceptable to God.  Spoke of the advantages of living together  like the people of the settlements on the Little Colorado, in being able to  gaurd against many of the evils the saints are surrounded with,  and encouraged the saints throughout this territory to unite together.  We should avoid going into debt and should be prompt in paying  those we hire thier wages.  There is a great field for labor among the  house of Israel.
