Brethren and Sisters do you understand   ENDENTRY Jan 1, 1877 this it seems a great many of the people know nothing  about it. It is true that Solomon built a Temple for the purpose  of Giving Endowments but from what we can learn of the History  of that time they gave vary few if any Endowments and one of  the High Priest was murdered by wicked and corrupt men  who had already began to apostitize because he would not reveal those things appertaining to the Priesthood that was forbidden  for him to reveal untuill he came to the proper place. I will not  say but what Enoch had Temples and officiated in them but we  have no account of it we know that he raised up a people so pure and Holy that they were not permitted to remain with the wicked  inhabitants of the Earth but were taken to another place. we as  Latter Day Saints have been laboring for over forty years and  the revelations given us in the first were to esstablish the kingdom by gathering the Saints, Building Temples, and organizing the  people as the family of heaven here on the Earth. we reared up a Temple in Kirtland but we had no basement in it nor a font or  preparations to give Endowments for the living or the dead it was left  by the Saints they going to Joseph Located the site for the Jackson Co Mo, and pointed out the South East cornor  of the Temple in the year Eighteen hundred thirty one. Also laid  the Far west Caldwell County Mo but these temple were not built. we built one in Nauvoo. I could  pick out several before me now that were there when it was built  and know just how much was finished and what was done it is true we left Brethren there with instructions to finish it and  they got it nearly completed before it was burned but the Saints  did not Enjoy it. Now we have a Temple which will all   ENDENTRY Jan 1, 1877 be finished in a few days and of which their is enough completed to commence work therein which has not been done since the days of Adam that we have any knowledge of, now these that can  see the spiritual Atmosphere can see that many of the saints are  still glued to this Earth and lusting and Longing after the things of this world in which there is no profit. It is true we should  look after the things of this world and devote all to the building up of the Kingdom of God According to the present feeling of many  of our Brethren they would arogate to themselves this world and  all that pertains to it, and scease not day nor night to see that  it was devoted to the building up of the kingdom of the Devil, and if they had the power they would build a railroad to carry it  to hell and esstablish themselves there whare are the Eyes and  hearts of this people whare is their interest for their own  salvation and that of their fore fathers. We Enjoy privileges that  are Enjoyed by no one Els on the face of the Earth, supposing  we were awake to this thing namly the salvation of the human family this house would be crouded as we hope it will be from Monday  morning untill Saturday night. This House was built here in this place purposely whare it is warm and plesant in the winter time and comfortable to work also for the Lamanites and all those coming from the South to receive their Endow- ments and other Blessings. What do you suppose the fathers  would say if they could speak from the dead would they  not say we "have lain here thousand of years here in this prision House waiting for this dispensation to come here we are bound and fettered in the association of those who are filthy, what would they whisper in our  Ears why if they had the power the vary thunders of heaven would be in   ENDENTRY Jan 1, 1877 our Ears if we could not realize the importance of the work we are inga- ged in, all the Angels in heaven are looking at this little handful of people so also are the devils in hell looking at this people too and trying to overth row us and the people are still shaking hands with the devil instead of sanctifying themselves and calling upon the Lord and doing his  work which He has commanded us and put into our hands to  do. when I think upon this subject I want the Tongues of seven thunders to wake up the people Can the Fathers be saved without us No. Can we be saved without them No. and if we do not  wake up and scease to long after the things of this Earth we will  find that we as individuals will go down to Hell although the  Lord will preserve a people unto himself Now we are ready to  give Endowments do you have any feelings for those who have  died without hearing the gospel. The spirit has awakened in the  people in the North when we gave the word that we should  do no more work in the Endowment House they came to us crying  and pleading to be baptized for their dead what Els could they  do they can come here and do the work for their dead and put these poor prisioners on the ground whare they will be free, do we realize this as long as we tarry here we are subject to the  world, but now go to like men and women and say we will  Embrace the Truth and Enter into the covenants of God and  carry them out then the bonds are broaken and the Harts of the  people are united in the Father. Perhaps Brethren and Sisters you  will not get my meaning but now go to work and let these infer- nal holes in the ground alone, and let the Gentiles alone who  would destroy us if they had the power you are running after them and ^some of^ our Brethren are putting their wives and daughters   ENDENTRY Jan 1, 1877 into their society and will go to the devil with them to if they do not look out. I would not have a dollar on the Earth if I had to get it there, it has been the kingdom of God with me and what I have I have got in this kingdom Well now some of the Elders are running after these holes in the ground and I see men here before me in this house that have no right to be here they are as corrupt in their harts as they can be and we take them by the Hand and call them Brother you will go to Hell lots of you unless you repent you may think this is  plain talk it is not as plain as you will find by and By. you will go to the gates of Heaven and Jesus will say I never knew you while you have been saying your prayers and going to your Meeting and are as cor- rupt in your hearts as man can be you had better stop now and  repent of your sins and sin no more while their is yet time and  before the doors are closed against you I want to awake you up  and if I had the power to lift the veil from your Eyes and let you  see things as they are you would be asstonished not but what there are a great many of the people as good as they know how to be, now I will say Bless the people that they may do better But show some  of the Elders of Israel according to their present conduct a  dollar one one side and Eternal Life on the other and I fear they would chuse the Dollar we are now prepared to attend to Bap- tizing and giving Endowments and shall appoint Tuesdays  and wednesdays for Baptisms and Thursdays and Fridays for Endowments and sealings as a standing appointment for  the present God Bless you Amen I do not know whether the people are satisfied with the services of the dedication of the Temple or not I am not half satisfied and I never Expect to be satisfied untill the devil is whiped and driven from off the face of the Earth.   ENDENTRY Jan 1, 1877 In the last remark the President made he struck the pulpit with a hickery cane filled with knots with such power that he buried three of the knots into the solid wood that they may remain ther for a generation if they are not filled up, his feet began to amend  from the time he made his speech.

I arived at the Staint George Washington County, Utah, at 8 oclok in the Morning. I was there surrounded with one hundred and fifty four virgins, Maidens Daughters and Mothers in Zion from  the age of fourteen to the Aged Mother leaning upon her staff. All had assembled for the purpose of Entering  into the Temple of the Lord to make me a birth day Present by being washed And Anointed and receiving their Endo- wments for and behalf of one hundred and Thirty  of my wives who were dead and in the spirit world  the majority of which had been sealed to me and the rem- ainder were to be, therse persons had been sealed to me during  the last fifteen years by Presidents Heber C. Kimball, Joseph F. Smith. Also 2Twenty four near relatives were added to   ENDENTRY to this list of wives for whom these beloved Sisters in  Zion were to receive their Endowments this day. As this was  to be confined to the sisters alone No men were to receive their Endowments to day. I put into this list all my near Relatives and saved none of the Thompson, Hart, or Woodruff family Except My own Mother Bulah Thompson Woodruff  and Grand Mother ^Dinah^ Woodford Woodruff My Step Mother Eudora L. Young Officiated for my ownly Sister Eunice Woodruff. And when this record was All made out the sisters occupied all five of the washing Bathes in the Temple, all the sisters were washed and Anointed Among the number were three wives and four daughters of President Brigham Young viz Naamah C. Young, ^Twiss^ and, Shamira  Young, and Ruth Young when they had all assembled to gether in the Creation Room I presented myself before them clothed in my white Doe skin Temple dress. I there delivered unto them a short address, But I had not Enough of immor tality about me to fully answer my mind. my soul was almost to full for utterance The following is a synopsis of my  speech. My Beloved Sisters I present myself before you  this morning, not ownly with prayer and fasting, but a heart filled with praise and Thanksgiving to my Heavenly Father for his mercy and kindness unto me, And also to you my  sisters for a Blessing of such magnitude as you are prese- nting unto me this day. I do not suppose that A scene of this kind was Ever presented before the heavens or the   ENDENTRY Earth, before God, Angels, or Man from this Earth since the foundation of world was laid: Therefore I feel justified in changing the order of the lecture usally  given here, there is no men here and all of you here heretofore received your Endowments. I feel that it is due you at  this time and place to give you the origin of this scene which is presented before us today. Ever since I have been working in this Temple my mind has been Exercised in behalf of the dead, And have felt a great desire to see my dead redeemed before I passed away. A few days ago I went into the Cealing room whare I often go to pray for I consider there is no spot on this Earth more acceptable than  this Temple and while there I went befor the Lord  with this subject resting upon my mind And I prayed the Lord to open My way to see my Dead Redeemed, And while I prayed the spirit of the Lord rested upon me and conveyed the following Testimony to FIGURES me. Let my servant Wilford call upon the virgins Maidens, Daughters, and Mothers in Zion and let them  Enter into my ^Holy^ Temple on the 1 day of March the day that my servant Wilford has seen the time  alloted to man, Three score years and Ten, and  there let them received their washing and Anont- ings and Endowments for and in behalf of the wives who are dead and halve been sealed to my servant Wilford, or those who are to be sealed to him, and this shall be acceptable unto me Saith the Lord, and the  dead of my servant shall be redeemed in the spirit   ENDENTRY world and be prepard to meet my servant at  the time of his coming which shall be at the time appointed unto him, though not revealed to man in the flesh##Mark 13:32##, Now go to and perform this work  and all shall be accomplished according to the desire of  your heart. This was mearly a key to me, light burst upon my understanding. I saw an Effetual  door open to me for the redemption of my dead, And  when I saw this I felt like shouting Glory Hallalulah to God and the Lamb. Now in this matter you can be  baptized for any number on the same day, but when  you come to giving Endowments one person can ownly  attend to one in a day. Some of those women you have  been officiating for have been sealed to me, some have not those that were sealed to me were sealed at various times  during the last twenty years, By President H. C. Kimball,  J. F. Smith I have never  taken this course without consulting President Young. when this thing was manifest to me I said to some of the sisters that I would like to have them come on my Birth day day and make me ^a^ present by getting Endowments for some of my dead, and as a testimony to me all  were willing. When I saw the magnitude of this I spoke  to President Young about it he said he would funish  half a dozen himself and He has in this assembly 5  widaughters and 3 wives I feel thankful to you my sisters  for this manifestation of Kindness for you might have searched the world over and you could not have found a   ENDENTRY presidentesent as deare to me as this. what is gold or silver in comparison to the redemption of our dead, Nothing. if I can redeem my dead, and save myself and family I will be satisfyed. I feel that when we get into the  spirit world we shall see the importance of this days work This is my birth day, I am three score years and tten to  day. you are to day in this Endowment withoutowt a man  with you. But we shall furnish one Man as an  L John Nuttall, will officiate as such, Sisters  you have the Blessings and Gratitude of my heart, And  I hope I may not ownly partake of Eternal life with  those whom you are redeeming to day, But with all  of you who are laboring for them this day. I pray  that we may all meet with them in the Celestial kingdom of our God Amen. I went through the Endowments  of the day more like being in vision than a reality These 154 Sisters were led to three veils and  three of us Wilford Woodruff J. D. T McAllister  and L John Nuttall all dressed in Temple Clothing took them all through the three veils. I took through  about 60, at the Middle veil, which I attended (there  was no sealing to day) President young was present at  the Temple in witnessing the ceremonies. At the close of  the labor at the temple I took a carriage and rode to  David M Cannons, from there I was Accompanied  to St George Hall by McAllister, Raleigh and  Nuttall and D M Cannon and placed in the midst of a surprize Party Got up for the Occasion the Room   ENDENTRY decorated, foand a Table set loaded with all the  luxeries of life, surrounded by nearly one hundred  of those who had been receiving Endowments for my  dead during the day. President Young set at the head of  the Table surrounded By his family and after Blessing was asked their was presented before me a present  of a birth day Bridal Cake three stories high adorned with the beasts of the field from the Elephant  down, and ornamented with two satin sheets covered  with Printed Poetry composed for the occasion and  these two sheets of Poetry had to be taken and read  Before the Assembly by Susan Young Dunford, the following  is the poetry contained on the two sheets of satin on  the other Page. This scene this day is among the most  wonderful Events of the last dispensation and fulness of times in which we live, and this door which is open for the redemption of the Dead in this manner will  accomplish great and important Results, for it is now being  carried out in a great many instances in the Temple of the  Lord, and will continue to be more and more unto the End this above remark is made on the 12 day of March upon  the Events taken place since the 1 day of March, by this labor in redeeming our dead by Proxey much can be accomplished our dead can be redeemed. This principle has given me great Joy unspeakable at the thought that I can live on the Earth to behold my Numerous friends redeemed who are in the  spirit world, this principle says to us in loud languae that the Lord is Good and Gracious, and his Mercies Endureth forever   ENDENTRY To  Elder Wilford Woodruff,  On the anniversary of his 70 Birth Birthday, spent in the Temple of the  Lord, officiating for his dead  June Hazel Dall (By proxy)   Thy seventieth year is now complete Oh, what a glorious day!

We meet to day with Joy to act, A proxy for thy dead, And Givee thee scores of wives who'll be Like crowns upon thy head. This day will never be forgot In heaven or on Earth below, Gods Blessings on Each one will rest— This, this we surely know.   Thy time and talents thou hast spent To do the work of God— Pleased to obey our Fathers call— And thought not of reward. Thou, faithful servant, never dreamed, For thee, there was in store, A Birth day such as this on Earth None have Enjoyed before.

How often the destroyer came To loose the band of life, And sou^ght^ to bear thee from the Earth, Because of thy belief—   Because thy work on Earth was great And much was still to come, He many times has sought thee out, But thou wast not alone;   A power above his power, forbid Rebuked him and he fled And left thee, still to Bless mankind The living and the dead.   And we rejoice with thee to day, That thou hast lived to see This birth day, in this holy house All hail! all hail! to thee.
