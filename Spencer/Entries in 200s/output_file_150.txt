 be adviseable to notify at leastfour new Elders to take theirplaces, to reach here in Sept.or October.I feel impressed to makea few suggestions in regardto my successor and yet Ihesitate to do so least you should think I am seekinga release for myself; I assureyou such is not the case forI am enjoying my labors and am perfectly willingto remain here and do allI can in my weak way forthe advansement of the causeof God, till He is satisfiedand His servants say it is enough: what I wish to sayis that when the time comes 
 could in a written communi-cation. I will just say that our district, and the annual conferences were all that we could expect, and were in ev-ery way successful.We continue to have an occasional European con-vert, and the Elders could use some European tracts to very good advantage, if you would kindly favor us again by send-ing another lot of them.As Elder Stevenson had intended returning by Europe, but having changed his mind, he has a surplus of money; and not caring to carry so much across with him, has deposited fifty (50) 
 sionaries at as early a date as March, for the work continues to grow, new fields are opening, and additional Elders will be needed. The five Elders which I wrote for last mail, please send as soon as convenient, in addition to the two sailing in March.Your instructions concern-ing the general fast day were received, but not till after the day appointed had passed. We however, realizing also the benefit of prayer, set apart one of the days of our conference when we fasted and offered our feeble supplications to the Throne of Grace in behalf of Zion gener-ally, and her leaders in par-ticular. It was a day of rejoic- 
 I think it advisable to sendsome one well versed inthe principles of the Gospel; ofgood judgment, and a manof experience in presiding orsitting in judgment on diff-icultys arising among memb-ers of the Church.Owing to their peculiar marr-iage relations their weaknessesand great adaptability tofollow after the sins and folliesof their wicked European nei-ghbors, curious and compli-cated cases arise which, as one Elder said, would takethe patience of Job and thewisdom of Solomon to settle, as the Elders here are allyoung men and before 
 ing to us, for the spirit of God was in our midst and we felt assured that our Father would hear and answer our prayers.We mail a report of our interesting conference to the News. Truly we had a time of rejoicing and we have not experienced a richer flow of the spirit of testi-mony since we have had the pleasure of laboring among this peculiar people. Many of the Elders have also been unusually blessed in acquiring the language, one in particular, who bore his testimony quite intelligently in the native tongue after a residence of but four weeks among them. The manifestations which we are almost daily receiving are a source of great consolation to us, 
 pounds with me. I have credited your account with this amount, which I will use on return fares of those re-turning in Oct. If you will kindly order the equivalent of this amount paid to him there, you will favor me very much.I am pleased to say that the Elders are all well, and laboring dilligently for the salva-tion of souls.I will not add more at present, as Bro Stevenson will tell you the news.The two Elders who were expected last month did not arrive. I hope there will be some on this boat as they are much needed.

I submit these suggestionsbecaus I realize this is alarge, important, and veryexpensive mission; beleivingthat its future success depe-nds largely on the capabilitiesand influence of the presidingofficer, and also through mygreat desire to see it continueto grow and prosper.Our yearly Conference willconvene April 4th, at which we anticipate a large turn-out and a good profitabletime; preparation's are being 
 and we know that God is with usin our labors among this people.Elder Wagstaff of whom wewrote as ailing, is now reportedby his president as being complete-ly restored to health through theadministrations and prayersof the Elders in his behalf.Please excuse this short noteas we are pupon a trip of aboutone thousand miles on horseback,and our time is very much lim-ited.

Z.Dec 26th 1889.President Wilford Woodruff andBrethren of the Council,My Dearly Beloved Leaders:I again take pleasure in addressing a few words to you, toreport our condition and requirements in this remote partof the Lords Vineyard. I am pleased to state first thatElders. Thos. C. Stanford, P. P. Thomas, L. J. Hawkes, M. Bennion, and O. C.Dunford and wife arrived safely and in good health andspirits, by the last mail boat having had a pleasant andcomparatively smooth passage. While on this subject, Iwill say that I think it would be best to discourage theElders from bringing their wives with them to this fieldof labor, for really it is not a suitable place, nor have weproper accommodations for our sisters.I was somewhat surprised at not getting noticefrom you of their coming, nor even a letter with them,and it was only by chance that I heard of their comingand averted what might have been quite an inconvenienceto them, as it is almost absolutely necessary for some one tomeet them here to assist them in making necessary pur-chases. etcWill you be kind enough to send me about five morenew Elders for this field, to fill the places of those which 
 ition to the purposes of God, andas his time is drawing nighcan we expect him to relaxhis efforts? We feel to say am-en to your testimonies regardingthe final result of the work ofGod.We thank the Lord that the saintsare once more privileged to listento your inspired concsels, andknow they appreciate them aswe shall do when once more al-lowed that great blessing. Wefeel to rejoice to know that weare remembered in your sup-plications to the throne of ourMaker, and can assure youthat fervent prayers are dailyoffered by the Elders and saintsin this far off land, for yourcontinued peace, health andgeneral prosperity. 
 will be released in April. If they could come on theboat which leaves San Francisco about April 5th, it wouldbe most convenient; if that is too short notice, please sendby boat leaving second or third of May.If you will kindly notify me a mail in advance Iwill appreciate it very much. I would like to haveat least two of them qualified for school teaching, andif I may be permitted to suggest, I would say, thatwhen selecting Elders for this field it would be wellto remember that they have a new and difficult languageto learn, and all books issued as helps to the learner, areon a grammatical basis, and therefore Elders who haveno knowledge of grammar, find the study very irksomeand the acquiring of the language almost impossible,consequently very discouraging to themselves and thenative saints who are expected to provide for them.The Lord has wonderfully blessed many of us, inour comparative ignorance of our own tongue, "Butall have not the same gifts, though directed by the same spirit" [##Doctrine and Covenants 46:11##] [##1 Corinthians 12:4##]With regard to the Australian part of our field oflabor we have but two there whom we can dependupon as laboring Elders, the third one (Brother Bromley)is visiting relatives, and as one of them, Brother Chip-man, will be released in April, it will perhaps benecessary to send some elders there. That is if it isintended to continue the mission. I suppose though 
 Since my appointment to the high and responsible position asPresident of this mission, acalling which I by no meansfeel capable of magnifying, I havebeen attending conferences andlaboring among the outsiders inthe extreme Northpart of theIsland.I am sorry to say that our labors were not crowned withmuch success, owing princi-pally to the united and persist-ant efforts of the clergy. Theyare continually warning thepeople against us, and in so-me withplaces we could withdifficulty get places to sleep,and having in many instances,the doors closed in our faces.The Maories are naturally ahospitable people, but the lies 
 that President Paxman has reported its conditions, andsuggested to you its requirements.From a recent letter received from Elder Chipman,he represents the people as being very indifferent, andthat after thoroughly advertising in daily papers, post-ing circulars etc., that but perhaps three or four strangerswould come to their hall, and it reminded usforcibly of our late experience in trying to interest theEuropeans of Auckland and suburbs. He reportsbut one baptism in the past three months.I am pleased to report that the work progresses favor-ably in this part of the mission, though we havemany things to contend with, the natives being soweak, and we are occasionally obliged to take actionagainst members for their persistent evil practices,and particularly for their running after the Moaripriests, or workers in witchcraft and Moari superstitionsWe recently visited a small neighboring island andGod so blessed us that we were permitted to add 52souls to the fold. We were met and opposed by satanwho took possession of one of the females there, butby the power of the priesthood of God, and in thename of his Son, he was cast out, the afflicted personbaptised, and we all rejoiced in the great testimonywhich was given to us.From our home papers we learn of the excellent

I really feel,from my acquaintance and associations withhim, that he will fully appreciate and dulymerit the salvation which is now offeredhim through his repentance.I was pleased also to learn that two more Elders were on their way to this field oflabor; I will have one of the brethren meetand welcome them to Maoridom.There was one question I askedin my communication of March 19th, inregard to half-caste Maories emigrating

 He, in connection with othersof the elders, has exercisedmuch faith, administeredto ordinances, but withoutthe desired effect.He has beencheerful through all his afflictions and will leave manywarm friends behind amongthe maori saints. I willarrange about his return farewhen I see you.I have no Rail-way half-fare permits. Ifyou can procure them forus, we would appreciate thekindness very much.Please mail them,or any instructions, to mecare of Grand Hotel, San Francisco. 
 to Zion, which apparently was overlooked,as your answer contains no mentionof it. I would like very much to haveyour mind on the subject, as there are oneor two who are talking seriously of makingan effort to get out of Babylon, and to gatherwith the saints in Zion.The following Elders will be releasedto sail October 6th:Charles Johnson, Jr. Grantsville,Joseph T.

Stevenson, and the balance (5 ) is theremainder from the 30  sent for brotherSmellie's return fare, 25  of which was used by brother S. O.

If the draft is mailed to comeon boat sailing Aug. 23rd it will be inample time, as I have sufficient now tosend the fare to the Elder in Australia, ifnecessary.The work is progressing about asusual. The Elders are quite energeticand the majority of Saints are rejoic-ing in the blessings of the Gospel: Manytimes the question is asked by them, "Whenare we to go to Zion?" "Why does not the prophet call us to the promised land?" Theyare no exception, for they get the spirit of gather-ing, as do their white brethren, on theirobedience to the principles of the Gospel.Praying God to abundantly bless you 
 has been very energetic in all his duties, and is much respected by the Saints with whomhe has labored.Elder Wagstaff has been in this field nearly twenty months.I have given him 25 pounds out of what I had on hand, and must therefor ask you to kindly add this amount to the draft which I wrote for last week.Please excuse this short scribble, as I am very busy.

 (Recd 22 Dec. 1890.)J. S. BinghamAhipara, Nov. 20, 1890.Prest Wilford Woodruff, Box B. Salt Lake City:Dear Brother:It affords me pleas-ure to again write you, and I am thankful to be able to re-port myself and the Elders in good health.Since writing to you from Tautoni, I in company with Elders Nye and Cutler, have been down to the extreme north end of the island, visiting all of the native villages, and have had the priv-ilege of bearing our testimony to many who had never before seen a Mormon Elder. As a rule we were kindly received, and attentively 
 listened to, but in some places they were so bitterly prejudiced by mendacious reports circulated among them by our enemies that they would not allow us to hold meet-ings. Wherever we could get a hear-ing, I think we allayed much of the prejudice and left the people more favorably impressed with what the world calls Mormonism.At one place a European and several natives desired baptism, but as we did not think the na-tives sufficiently enlightened, we advised them to wait till some future visit of the elders.There are some fine people in this section, and I trust that they will eventually accept the truth.We are now at the house of a Half Caste who has a European 
 wife and a large family. Tomorrow we shall have the pleasure of lead-ing him into the waters of baptism, and his wife being quite favorable, we hope in time to baptize them all.Since writing I have heard from most of the presidents of districts.Several excommunications, are reported but no baptisms showing that the adversary is still at work; not only in hardening the hearts and blinding the minds of the outsiders; but also in leading astray those who have been initiated into the truefold.I have not heard from the breth-ren in Australia since Prest. Wright's return.Elders Heywood, Young, Nye and Dame will be released to return home 
 next April. Please send us two new elders to take their place. The mission is well supplied with elders at present, but I think it best for two to come and be acquiring the language, as another company will be released about next OctoberA report is going the rounds at present to the effect that a manifesto forbidding the practice of polygamy has been issued by the President of the Mormon Church; and ratified by a mass meeting of 15,000 Mormons. The newspapers are all commenting upon it, and we are every-where plied with questions concerning it. Having heard nothing authentic, we treat this as a rumor of the same nature as the hundreds of others which are continually being put in circulation concerning us, still we 
 would be pleased to learn from you whither ^any^ action has been taken to give foundation to such a report?The spring has been unusually cold and stormy, but it is now fine, and becoming quite warm. The prospect is that crops will be good, and the na-tives will have plenty of food next win-ter.They are most all at home at this season of the year and it is an excellent time for the Elders to travel among the outsiders, but as soon as the season of cultivation is is over they scatter out into the gumfields, and it is hard to reach them. We could not have chosen a better time for our visit to this end, as wherever they would receive us at all we had crowded housesThere have been some riots of late 
 among the natives of what is known as the King Country, and several who are guilty of plundering stores etc., have been arrested and are now in custody. We are in hopes that something will transpire to lessen the influence of King Tawhio and Te Kooti, the Maori Prophet, so that their followers will accept the gospel. As it is at present they are so carried away by foolish vagaries that they will not listen to anything rea-sonable.The health of the Saints I believe is generally good. Many are trying to live their religion, and are mak-ing commendable progress in the knowledge of the gospel, while others I am sorry to say are yielding to temptation, and returning to their "wal-lowing in the mire." 
 Some are becoming anxious to go to Kiona, (Zion), but I think it quite wise to help them here until they provethemselves worthy.There are, no doubt, a few worthy persons who, surrounded as they areby the contaminating influences of the world, yield to temptation, while under more favorable circumstances they might perhaps endure faithful; but in my opinion there are many more who would eventually fall away even were they permitted to emigrate, and it is far better to purge them out and have them here than to take them to Zion. There is too much dross there already. I find that many have been baptized without a knowledge of the gospel, and my experience is that it is more difficult to convert a person after baptism than before. 
 Most of the European Saints are la-boring with a view to going to Utah, but some of them are in very poor circumstances being destitute of all comforts, and having barely sufficient to sustain life.I will not weary you further. Hoping to hear from you soon, and continually praying for the onward progress of truth and right-eousness, I remain as everYour Brother in Christ, J. S. BinghamAddress, General P. O. Auckland 
 Tantoru Oct. 25 1890Prest. Wilford Woodruff,Box B.,Salt Lake City.Dear Brother:It now becomes my pleasant duty to write you,and inform you of my whereabouts.Your letter informing meof my appointment to the presi-dency of the Australasion Missioncame to hand by due course of mailand was, it is useless to say, a greatsurprise to me. I feel very weak inhaving to assume so great respon-sibility, but I sincerely hope andtrust that God in His infinitemercy will bless me with wis-dom, and bestow upon me all 
 other qualifications requisite to theproper performance of all laborsand duties connected with the management of His affairs inthis land, as I earnestly desire tomagnify my calling acceptably andfor the interest of the mission.Since the departure of Prest. Wrightand companions for home, I havebeen traveling in the Bay of IslandsDistrict in company with Elders Nyeand Hixson. We have had thepleasure of baptizing eight persons.On account of scarcity of food andfor other reasons we thought it notadvisable to hold any conferences in this part of the island, so I amtraveling through the districts visit-ing the branches and speakingto the people as opportunities are af-forded. It seems that gleaning and 
 sifting is the process at present, asall of the natives have all heardthe testimony of the Elders, and itis quite difficult to awaken anyinterest.The Elders I believe are allin good health. Sister Dunford atlast account was also well and per-forming her dutises as teacher quitesatisfactorily. The school is wellpatronized, the present enrollmentbeing forty five.Prest. Wright with the compa-ny of Elders and Saints I supposewill arrive at San Francisco today,and ere this reaches its destinationyou no doubt will have had aninterview with him and learnedof the general condition of affairsin the missionBro. Geo. E. Woolley having la- 
 bored in Australia for two years,will be released to return homein January.

I am thankful to statethat I am still well, and that the elders, though some arenot robust, are all able to travel and perform their du-ties. The weather thus far thiswinter has not been so coldand stormy as it was lastwinter, and there has beenless sickness and deathamong the natives, thougha few have succumbed tola grippeI very much regret to 
 report the release of Elder[redacted]for misconduct.He through the weaknessof the flesh yielded to thetemptation of the adversary, andmade improper overtures to ayoung Maori woman. He didnot commit himself, but ac-cording to his own confessionwould have done so had a favorable opportunity pre-sented itself. He seems fullyto realize the gravity of his mis-take, and is suffering the mostbitter remorse. It is a most de-plorable affair, and is some-thing that has been carefullyguarded against ever sincethe opening of this missionamong the Maori people aswe fully realized how disas- 
 astrous it would be to the causeof truth should any of the elders be found guilty of a violation of the law of chas-tity among this simple-mindedand confiding people, but thelong dreaded evil has at lastbefallen us. Just how detrimen-tal this sad affair will provewe at present cannot tell, butI fear that it will be some-time before we regain thatimplicit confidence whichthe natives have hitherto placedin us as servants of the Lord.We shall endeavor as wehave ever done to show in themost emphatic way possi-ble our disapproval of suchconduct, and fervently prayto God to counteract theevil influence that the

Their opponentwas a leading minister ofthe Christ Diciples, or Camp-bellites, as they were formerlycalled. His arguments consist-ed almost entirely of a reitera-tion of the "Solomon Spaulding 
 Our annual conference wasa most enjoyable one. Nine-teen Elders, Sister Dunford andabout five hundred natives werepresent. The Spirit of the Lordwas bestowed in rich abundance, and harmony and goodfeeling raeigned. The Elders areunanimous in saying that itwas the best conference that theyhave attended in this land.A few of the saints were sick,but our Heavenly Father inHis tender and loving mercyheard and answered our sup-plications in their behalf, andthey were raised up fromtheir beds of affliction.

In my opinion, therefore,it will be better for the interestsof the Mission ^if^ some person of wisdom and experience be sentfrom home to take the presidency,especially if one could be sent whois already familiar with the Maorilanguage.At our Semi annual Con-ference held on January 9, 10, 11, ElderHeber S.

T. Stewart to the presidency of the Australasian Mission.  I think it a wise selection and one that willgive universal satisfaction a-mong the Maori saints.  By them Bro. Stewart is held in high es-teem, and they never weary of speaking of his many merits.I think it will be best for 
 for a while, but at last accounts wasimproving. Elder J. H.

Knowing that the time for my release was drawing nigh, I have deferred writing, thinking that I couldmore easily explain the sit-uation verbally than by let-ter, but as some time will e-lapse before I see you, I now submit my views for your consideration. 
 accomplished. The people take no in-terest in the gospel, there are veryfew opportunities for holding publicmeetings, and very little can be doneexcept by means of tracts. Having notracts with which to work at present,they are at loss to know how toproceed. I think that we have afew English tracts at Aucklandwhich I shall send to them whenI reach that pointElder Woolley will start home inJanuary via England. I shall sendan Elder from here to take his place.Please send us a check for  120to pay return fare of Elders J. S. Nye,J. S. Dame, J. N. Heywood, and T.

 When Prest. Wm. Paxman was laboring here, the harvest was great and many laborers were meeded, but since that time the harvest seems measurable to have passed, and at present there is but little desire on the part of out-siders for the gos-pel and little opportunity to labor among them.The mission is divided in-to districts or conferences, with towo or three elders in each district.  Some of these districts are quite small with no apparent prospect of becom-ing any larger, and the el-ders being compelled to spendmost of the time among the saints, become rather bur-densome.  If some of the dis-tricts were joined together, which

Although it is

I am confident thatas much would be accom-plished, and the elders wouldlabor with more satisfac-tion to themselves and thesaints. Besides this, there wouldbe a great saving of timeand means.On Poverty Bay and WarapaDistricts, for instance, thereare five elders where three atthe most are sufficientI have thought if sendingtwo elders, or one elder and anative to Chatham Islandto try to open the missionthere, but thus far I have notfound it practicable.

Its contents were pe-rused with much interest andhighly appreciated, as are allof you instructive and en-couraging correspondencesI regret very much to learn of the death of President DanielH. Wells. But while we mournhis loss, there is great consola-tion in the assurance thathaving kept the faith andfought the good fight, he hasgone to the realms of bliss where 
 he can rest from the toils andtrials of the the flesh while heenjoys the society of holy menof God, and mingles his voicein council with those who havepreceded him to the mansionsof our Heavenly Father.I am pleased to state thatthe Elders are in the enjoymentof sufficient health and strengthto be able to perform their du-ties. Elder J. H. Burton, whom Imentioned in my last as beingquite ill, is now much betterand is pursuing his labors as usu-al. I think he is troubled withasthma, and this heavy dampatmosphere is quite severe onhim at times, but I trust thatby being cautious he will be a-ble to remain until his mis-sion is fulfilled which is his 
 earnest desire.Your letter of Oct. 15, 1890 hasnot come to hand, and conse-quently I did not received anyinstruction concerning the re-lease of Elder Wm. Bromley un-til receipt of your last. I haveborrowed  30 to pay the expen-ses of his return, and have senthim his release. Owing to a de-lay in the transfer of the mon-ey, I think he will not be ableto start home until June.I do not know of any one to ac-company him. I have written El-der Cutler to advise him to waittill he can have company ifhe thinks it unsafe for him togo alone.You did not state whetheryou sent a check for his returnfare. 
 News from Australia is stillsomewhat encouraging. Infor-mation has been received from ElderCutler of a few new baptisms, andprospects are favorable for the per-formance of more work. On this is-land also the Europeans are beginning to accept our testimony. Withinthe last month eleven have beenbaptized, and many others areinvestigating. Opportunities to holdmeeting with them are increasingI trust that a good work willyet be performed among them.With an earnest prayer for the on-ward progress of the work of the Lord,and hoping you are all well,I remain,Your Brother,in Truth,John S.

D. Haight whosailed Feby 27, John H Burton who sailed Apl 23rdand Jos S. Groesbeck who left for home by way ofEurope on 30th of last month; These Elders haveall filled good missions in this land. In returningthem I had to borrow of Bro. Hardy  40, whichwith the  50 which was sent me some monthsago made up the Sum. I hope it will not belonger than another month till I can pay him.Enclosed please find the StatisticalReport of this Mission which I have not at presentan opertunity of comparing with the last one, butwill say that it like previous ones contains nameswhich should be eliminated to the extent of consider-ably reducing the total, by increasing ^the^ deaths & excom-munication totals, as numbers who have been baptized have went off and never returned, havingeither died or apostatized, but it will be sometime before this can be regulated so that the reports 
 will correspond closely with our exact numbers.Our Anual conference was heldat Te Rahui Waiapu Valley which is at the Eastcape.The Southren districts were well represented, but onlythe Elders came from the northren. Our meetingswere well attended the large carved Maori housebeing crowded in nearly every meeting. It washeld on the 8th 9th and 10th of April. From the reportsand my personal acquaintance can say, thatwhile the numbers in the mission have been decreas-ing, yet many of the Saints are increasing theirfaith and diligence and are not near the childrenin understanding they were upon coming in to thechurch, anvery many of them have kept themselvesStraigt. I am happy to say, since they first receivedthe Gospel, and give promise of being so unto the endand Shows the results of the good labors in this landnot only of those "who planted", but those who havebeen "watering", as well as manifesting the Graceof "God who giveth the increase" and is a source ofJoy and thanksgiving to those who labor here.We have been much troubled with the vice of gambling,^especially on horse races,^ amongst this people, and where they have been dealtleniently with in this matter it has generally resultedin drunkeness, adultery, etc. In endeavoring tostop it, some have been excommunicated, where they 
 have defiantly persisted therein, in the district wherethe latter course has been pursued and it hasbeen nipped in the bud, success has seeminglyattended, and this evil is well under hand ^in those districts^ at presentAnd the Elders generally feel that it is the bettercourse to pursue. Yet our home mail bringsnews that this evil is rappidly on the increase at home,and those indulging therin, does not seem to becalled in question; In fact it appears that somewho should be examples to the people because oftheir position's are leading they way. And the questionnaturally arises in our minds, wether we arejustifed in dealing with this people for this offence,when it is not a question of fellowship with the^more experienced^ Saints in Zion.The Saints here were anxious tohave the Doctrine & Covenants translated into theirlanguage, but when I gave them your adviceupon it they seemed willing to let it rest, butasked if the Ready Reference could not be printedin their language I told them I would refer thematter to you. And will added that if it wasprinted with the Book of Mormon references, whichare in small type figures in the compendium, itwould no doubt be of much benefit to themand to the Elders laboring here. 
 In Australia four Elders are laboring, but withlittle success further than keeping a live thefew members in that vast country, and warningthe wicked inhabitants thereof. Two labor in victoriaand two in Queesland and at last report ^in^ both placesthey were keeping bachelors hall when at head quarters.The few Saints in that land appear to be very poor andscattered, and the greater part of them very week in thefaith. And it is really questionable in my mindwhether we ought to keep that part of the mission upIf you could send me a few hun-dred blanks forms ^for^ Statistical ^reports^ they would be muchappreciated.I believe all the Elders in the missionhave good health, at least so far as I know, andthose on this Island left our conference in goodSpirits. I now have a very fair personal knowledgeof the condition of the Mission, having visited most of thebranches to do which have traveled about 3000 miles by on horseback and several hundred by Steamer and rail. Andwhile some of the districts are in a bad condition, uponthe whole we have much to Encourage us.Ever desiring the welfare of Zion andthe triumph of truth, I am, as I ever hope to be,obediently yours.W. T. Stewart. 
 Te Hauke,New Zealand, April 12th 1893.Prest W. Woodruff, Box. B. Salt Lake City.Dear Brother,Your favor of Feb. 27th came duly to hand. The Elders referred to therein arrived safely, and were present at our Conference, just closed.The two drafts, for  91.12.8, and  10.1.3, came to hand, and were duly forwarded to the Bank.The notice of reduction probably is too late to apply to Elder H. B. Dalling, in Australia, as I had previously sent unto him his fare from the amount on deposit. In relation to the reduction I beg to submit that the amount ^named^ would be sufficient if parties ^were^ sailing from Auckland or Sydney for SaltLake, but releases most frequently find Elders in their fields of labor, far removed from either of these ports, requiring from  1 to  4 to reach either of them, so that the former allowance left a margin ranging from $ 25 to Nil, after necessary hotel expenses, in Auckland & San Francisco, were paid, but, in cases where the returning Elders resided far from Salt Lake and releases found found them at the farthest points from sailing port, even the former allowance was 
 inadequate. In cases where there has been a margin of any considerable amount it has been found almost indispensible, to enable the Elders to make themselves presentable for travelling, for which reason I have not felt justified in recommending a reduction of the fares.I hope to make arrangements with one of the Saints, who is going to Zion this month, for an exchange of money, whereby I will obtain sufficient funds, at your last mentioned rates, for the return fares of Elders J. M. Hendry, J. M. Hixson, J. G. Kelson and E. Atkin, (respecting which I wrote you Feb. 13th) drawing an order on you for the amount, viz: $500.Should I succeed, the order will be presented to you before May 17th. In case that it is not presented at that date, you will please forward the return fares for above-named Elders, but If, upon consideration of the foregoing, you should deem it proper to remit a larger sum, the balance may be forwarded, if the above-mentioned order is presented.I shall require four Elders to leave SanFrancisco, Aug 18th, amongst which, if possible, I would like another of our old Maori missionaries, who learned the language. 
 President Paxman will be able to advise you respecting those who labored under his direction.Elders Madsen, ^Dalling^ Hales, and Andrus will return to Zion this month, accompanied by three families of Europeans Saints, numbering about 17 souls.A native brother and his wife have importuned me very earnestly to permit them to accompany me home, with a view of permanently locating there.The husband speaks enough English for all practicable purposes, and is very industrious and economical. They have been very exemplary members since their baptism in 1884.I feel that they would be contented and prosperous in Zion, but do not wish to encourage them without your permission, and I mention it now, that, in case you sanction their gathering, they can make preparations after your advice reaches me.Our Annual Conference has just closed and all the Elders present feel that the Mission is in a prosperous condition. 
 We had a large gathering and a good spirit prevailed.Enclosed please find our Semi AnnualStatistical Report.The health of the Elders is very good, and all join in kind regards,Your Brother in the Gospel,W T StewartPresident of the Australasian Mission.P.

 Gisborne, New Zealand Feby 14th 1893.President Wilford Woodruffand Counselors.Salt Lake CityDear Brethren;The two letters from Brother Reynolds containing  15.0.0 for a brother Fryer, and $2500 in green backs for Elder Nebeker came safely to hand.We will require four Elders to take the places of Elders that will be released to return home about July 15ththey should come by the Steamer which is booked to leave San fFrancisco May 26th.If a good supply of Morgans Nos 1 and 2 and Richs "True vs false Religion" ^Tracts^ could be sent out by these brethren they would be very much appreciated by the Elders laboring among the EuropeansAnd by the same mail will need return fares for Elders J. M. Hendry, Jno G. Kelson J. M.

 of others residing near him 2181 souls altogether are making preperations and expect to leave for Zion just after the April Conference, asking me at the same time writes me for advice,and notwithstanding there has been a generaldiscouragement to gathering throughout out the mission. Yet a few of the saints in different parts seem very anxious to go, and the Spirit of gathering resting upon them seems irrepressable,  another case I failed to mention is the mother of the the maori boy who went home with my nephew J C Stewart in 1886.  and is now a young man living at Kanab, and quite able to look after his mother and two younger brothersShe has been deserted by her husband, and suffers very much from asthma, but is one of the most faithful of saints.  beleiieveing that our dry mountain air would give her a new lease of life and that naught but good can possibly result from her goining I have so advised,but in her case only.  However I feel strongly impressed that it will be greatly to the advantage of this mission If a few here and there of the most faithful and those best calculated to look out for themselves were to gather out, that they may go there and becomeaccustomed to the new conditions, thereby being a great aid to those who should follow them yet a believe 
 Our native mission here is coming on, as well I think, as we can reasonably expect. Inour efforts to put down betting in all its various forms your direct and pointed counsel has been of great benefit carrying weight and influence with the natives, and all ^thus far^ with with only one or two exceptions have agreed to cease this vice which have been depriving those engaging therein of a free flow of the Holy Spirit. There is a marked improvement going on with those who are faithfulin this land.Preparations are now being made for our April Conference to be held at Te Haukeand the Saints and Elders are looking forward to that event with much pleasure. 1893 has thus far distinguished itself, ^on th[e]se islands^ in the peculiararity of its weather and the number of itsearthquakes it has thus far produced. New Zeal-and has had a couple of miniture cyclones, whilst in Australia unprecedented floods in some sections and drougth in others have done ^an^ imme[n]se ammountof damage greatly increasing the suffering, desti-tution and misery which has prevailed there for two or three years and the end is probably not yetfor the inhabitants are reported as being in the main anv ungodly, immoral set, many of them keeping up no "form of Godliness" whilst the great majority of those who do are "lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God"  they seem to be

 rappidly preparing themselves for the wrath and indignation of an offended God which will as surely be poured out upon the unrepentant and rebelleous inhabitants, ^of the earth^ as it has been foretold by the spirit of prophecy and the revelations of the Almighty.In the main the Elders seem to sense the responsibility the Lord has placed upon themin by calling them to preach repentance and warnmankind. And are endeavoring to perform this labor of love as the Spirit directs that their garments may be free from the blood of this generation.We feel that the Lord is still softening the hearts of the enemies of Zion as is manifested by Judge Zanes recent decision in the church suit, the granting of am^n^esty, dismissing of old cases against our brethren, and the general disposition of the pressand people to deal more freely with the saints.We have watched with no little interest the recentpolitical contest in our Territory and while we regret the spirit of strife and bitterness manifested by many of the saints when carried away with the excitment of debate wherein crimination and recrimination was indulged and offensive person-alities were substituted for argument, yetwe think experiences of this nature are necessary,sooner or a later, are necessary to qualify the saints to assume that high position among the 
 great care should be exercised in selecting those who are first advised to go, to avoid if posible murmuring and dissatisfaction on their part till they be come thouroughly established.  I am satifed that the nations of New Zealand, owing to the severer climate, poorer soil and meagre natural productions of the country they inhabit are naturally much better fitted for residence in the valleys of the Rockies than the inhabi-tants of other Islands of the pacific where dwell members people of this interesting race, whilst their extensive associantions, and business intercourse with Europeans for a generation will enable them to readily assimilate with our people at home.all of the young men ^are^ expected here to earn their own living even when the family's to which they belong are, by virtue of lands, rents, or stock posesses, comparatively independant.  The labor they usualy seek ^is that^ offering the greatest reward and requiring the most exertion. Such as Sheep shearing,  grass seed gathering and bushefalling.  in these lines their aptitude and phsiysical strength enables them to eaisly compete with the white man,  in fact none of them have ^any^ dificulty in finding work even where the raks of unemployed whites are gradually increasing.  The probably payout more for clothing and nearly as much for groceries as the average white labourer, except in those isolated 
 nations which they are destined to occupy and thesooner begins their political education the soonerwill they be prepared but howe much better ifthe saints could avoid such unwarranted extremes,however those who will are saints indeed willcome through all th[e]se experiences and acknowledgeGods hand therein and that his power andblessings are with his people and that thecourse of Zion is upward and onward desiring to labor to that end and to keep pace ^there^ with.I remain as everYours etcW.

The wall of prejudice & intolerence, which have so long stood between the servants of God and the hearts of the people, seem of late to be crumbling away.  The impartial accounts, published throughout this part of the world, of the Salt Lake Temple and its dedication have contributed no little to this end.I have recently learned that Elder Jas S. Abbott, of Annabella Sevier Co. Utah, who landed here in Oct 6th 1892.  And of whose coming I was duly notified, received his endowments in the Manti Temple, July 22nd of that year.  Afterwards or Aug 18thhe married a wife at Hinckley by Bp Pratt of that

He says that the President of the Temple, ^or whom he supposed, to be,^ advised this course after he (Abbott) had related to him all the particulars of the case.  He says also that "the Bishop of his ward and Henry Clark of Richfield were both cognizant of the circumstances."  I asked him if Bp Pratt knew he had his endowments when he married him he said "He could not say."  This matter being so very irregular I cannot think but what some blunder has been committed notwithstanding the representations of Bro Abbott.  I therefore feel ^constrained^ to report the matter to you and will anxiously await your action thereon, as I have advised that he do no ordinance work till the matter is cleared up, or an authoritative explanation is received.We have been having an usually wet cold winter, rivers flooded, and bridle paths in many places well nigh impassable.  Notwithstanding which the health of the elders is remarkably good, and their influence is being felt for good especially among the remnants of Israel in this land.

 to go within a month from to day, the date fixedfor my departure, I can not at present say. As recentlegislation by the N. Z.

Prejudice melts away much more readily at the approach of truth than formerly and, everything bids fair for a good seasons work.Notwithstanding your kind response when asked for tracts we have been much handicaped for the want of these convenient little messengers to introduce us to the people.  and have ordered several thousand from Liverpool.  but should you advise us to go a head with the purchase of a press, I think that in a short time this difficulty will be overcome.The health of the Elders continues good so far as I am at present advised.

After the sale of the first thousand ^coppies,^ it will be on a safe business footing.We have agitated, to some extent, the purchasing of a small printing press, for the purpose of issuing a paper in the maori language, and, the printing of what tracts we may need in the mission.

 sal favor among the natives and Elders. I think the Saints here would subscribe quite liberally of their means towards this end, both, for its establishment and maintenance, however, we do not feel like moving out in this direction without your advice, the more so as none of us have had experience in this line of business. Should you feel to en-courage the undertaking, providing it can be made self supporting, any advice as to kind, size, and probable cost of press, will be greatly appreciated. Upon the receipt of your reply to this, if favorable, the mission will be im-mediately canvassed and if the results warrant will proceed at once to make arrangements etc., in which case we would want a practical printer sent out, the younger the better, so he could acquire the language, thereby, greatly increasing his useful-ness.The measles have swept over this country, and, though, usually very fatal with natives, who are ignorant of its nature and proper treatment, the mortality has been very light indeed, as compared to its former visits to these Islands.The general health now, of both Elders and Saints is good so far as I am advised.The "female franchise" and "local option" has made the present session of N. Z. Parliament very lively and caused a quite a ripple on the political sea of the colony and I might say of Australasia. The success of the former measure is now in accomplished fact, and may be regarded as a very radical departure for a British Colony. Of course, it had bitter opponents among the conservative class

Thelocal option Bill will succeed, but no doubt, but in such aform that but little good can expected from it.Although this is a new country, "Strikes," "labour troubles"and "unemployed" are not strangers here. Money has exercised afar greater influence here in the settlement of this country, than,what we have known, especially, in the western part of America.Land monopoly, or the mopoly of the natural facilities,make it an easy matter for Capital to dictate its ownterms, which means the enslavement of the masses. What acontrast between this and the ^Spirit,^ method, and ultimate resultscharacterizing the settlement of the Saints in the once forbiding,but now, beatutiful and happy vales of Zion.These is a strong feeling growing here in favor of thesingle tax system, so ably advocated by Henry Georgeof America and looking to the naturalization of the land.The Gov't here are proceeding somewhat along those lines bya system of a grauated land tax. The law being adjusted so thatthe larger the holdings the greater their proportionate amount of tax.Of course wise legislation may, to some extent, modifyexisting evils, but, only modify, for their final abolition,we must look to something that will tear from the heartof man the incubus of selfishness an[d] hate; immerse intin a solution that will dissolve its calloused surface which hasbeen formed by ages of accumulated wrongs and oppressions;then, implant within it a love that is as broad ashumanity, and as induring as eternity; inspire it with aknowledge of man's brotherhood and God's fatherhood,

 Auckland New ZealandSeptember 89th 1892President Wilford Woodruff. & CounsellorsSalt Lake CityDear Brethren;It becomesmy painful duty to report the death of ourfellow laborer, Bro Otto Chipman ^of American Fork^ afterabout aweeks illness.  during which time he was attendedby aElder T. C. Stanford, myself and Elders Madsenand hamblin was with him the last night.  Hehad been delirious for three days before death, yet herecognized and called each of us by name uponour arrival but soon after relapsed into his formercondition being lost to surroundings.  He died onthe 31st of August and will be shipped by theoutgoing mail.  Elder Stanford and Hawkes willaccompany his body home.  His death sickness istraceable to getting wet through a canoe capsizing.Elder Chipman was making good progress inthe language ^during his six months here^ and gave promise of becoming avery efficient missionary.  But it has been otherwiseordained.  The sympathy of the Elders for his wifeand relatives, and sorrow at parting with atrue friend has cast a gloom over all. Yet 
 while we sorrow we realize that our kind HeavenlyFather doeth all things well, and we think itbetter to be called to labor on the other side of the vailwhen active and faithful here, than when in thoseconditions of indifference and worldly mindednesswhich many of the Saints have drifted into.Bro Stanford will be able to give you allthe particulars.  I have instructed him to telegraphyou from Sanfrancisco and have you convey thesad inteligence to the bereaved family.The expenseshere have been quite heavy as you will see bythe enclosed bill.  Bro Stanford takes  10.0.0 topay Rail way charges on the other side, how muchit will require I have no idea, but he will telegraphfor more if he needs it.  He is also to let you knowwhen he will be in Ogden so that relatives or otherscan meet him there.  I supupose the family willpay all the expenses above the usual return fareBro Hardy kindly came to my aid inmoney matters.  next month I expect return fares, as per Bro Reynolds advice, for the two Elders goingnow the balance as per bill of  44.4.10 I willexpect by return mail.In March 1885 ^an^ ElderHill was released from this mission by his ownrequest on account of ill health  he clained he 
 had money to take him home so that nothing was paid on his return fare.  I was then presidinghere and subsequently learned that he borrowed 10.0.0 of one Brother Fryer with a promise topay it in 3 months.  Elder Charles Heybourne ofCedar acquainted me with the case and has beendoing all he could to have brother Hill pay it, butthus far without success.  I think that the amountought to be paid with at least Five Pounds interestadded.  And as nothing was paid on brother Hillsreturn ^fare^ and as it seems he refuses to pay this sumand did not have the manhood to report it at thetime and ask it to be paid ^then^ I now feel it myduty to report it to you knowing that you willtake that course that will be proper under thecircumstances. The amount of interest mentioned aboveis computed at 5 per cent the legal rate here. Brother Fryer is still in the church but I am in-formed that this has been quite a trial to him.Elder B. Hamblin. has had soreeyes Since April sometimes better some times worse. he is now here in Auckland to ^have them^ be treated the dDoctor Sayshe will be able to cure them in 4 weeks.  Should hehowever not obtain relief, will release him toreturn I hope however this will not be necessarywith this exceptions the Elders are all well orwere at last accounts.On my last visit to the 
 Southren districts a system of home missionarywork was inaugerated, calling into active labor ^service^an number of the Native's; recent reports from thosedistrict in relation to this labor is very gratifying.I believe in the majority of the branches wecan report an improvement whilst in some of ^the reverse^is the case.  A long wet disagreeable winter isnow drawing to a close and we are greatly in hopesthat during the coming summer we will be ableto accomplish considerable good and be ableto make favorable reports.With best regardsI remainYours etcW. T. StewartP. S. Three more Elders will be needed bythe Boat leaving 'Frisco in DecemberW. T. S.[Handwriting Changes]The money should be sent.  AndI would suggest, a letter be written tobro Hill respecting the payment of thatmoney he borrowed, and urging him tomeet his obligation.  A few words sentto R. W. Heybourne, enquiring aboutHill, and asking him to use his influ-ence, if he had any with, Hill wouldno doubt be a good thing.J. F. S.

I amglad the subject has come beforeyou again, and I pray the Lord^that^ all that He requires may beaccomplished ^in^ the holy land.I am strongly impressed with theidea that a competant elder ^or elders^ shouldbe instructed ^by the presidincy^ and sent to Turkey toplant the germ, and it seems to ^me^that the work of the elders ^in years past^ isabout to culminate in a foothold being obtained in Asia Minorto successfully platnt the gospelamong the people.Bros Musser and Hermanare very intellegent men, but theyneed a more experienced man thereto direct in these important matters.Bro.

Scarcely a man in the missionwho has ever been in the missionary fieldbefore.If Bro Empey & B. S.

True theyare few, but the warning reaches them.I have no confidence in my health. Sometimeswithout warning I feel like I would faint away, circu-lation very feeble, I fast, and that hurts me. I try to be care-ful in eating and drinking, but there is something wrong withmy breathing aparatious when the air is muggy and cold ^I suffer^ Imention this to ^give^ a reason why I cannot get down to workas I would like to.Have been in south of England where I feel muchbetter.I am patiently waiting for some one to take charge asyour letter instructed me.

 Auckland, N. Z.Feb 11th 1897.Prest. Wilford WoodruffSalt Lake City, Utah.Dear Brother:We are in receipt of letter dated Jany.5th reporting five more Elders for this mission.They have undoubtedly arrived Sydney ere this.We can use them and also others.Regarding the  197.0.0 to come next mail,oweing to the ill-health of Elder Moroni Lazenbyit was deemed wise to release him to returnhome by the March boat. Elder C. H. Embley wasalso released to accompany him. The former hasbeen here something over two and the latter some-thing over three years. I have arranged withBro. Hardy to use  50.0.0 of the above amount fortheir return fares. And it is desired to releasefour more Elders at our April Conference in theWairarapa which according to usual allotmentswould make in all  150.0.0 more, which we wouldbe very pleased to receive not later than April.It will be seen that our report is not madeout as suggested by letter dated Jany. 4th Viz.giving births and deaths of males and femalesseparately. And 'tis now too late to change or cor- 
 them except there should hapily be an immediateand radical change!The epistle from yourself and colaborers tothe Maori saints, was read to our Conference,and copier of same presented to Tamahan, HoaniRangi Te Kaiwaho, Pu Rakaw and other outsideleading male and female Rangatirai who werelending much to the support and success of ourConference, which brought forth much favorablecomment. The remaining copies were given toPresidents of Conferences for distribution among thesaints. It seemed almost to overjoy the grey-hairedcolored veterans, to see that you entertained notbut words of counsel, good will and blessing forthem, though they did not see as we do; and thatso far as we were concerned, we wished to beat peace with, and have love and good will forall men, and gave efficacy to what I had toldthem, i. e. that you had not sent us out here asenemies of man or creed, but only to be enemiesof all unrighteousness.I announced to the Conference your ap-proval of the saints sending geneologies to HiriniWhoianga for him to be kept in the Temple work.I think it will be the means of inspiring themmuch in that direction.

 rect it and reach you for conference. The breth-eren inform me that this is according to ElderJensen's late instructions. We will endeavour tofollow out your suggestions in the future. I wouldlike to ask if new baptized members are to alsoappear in column as members received?Elder Almond Thomas Butterfield is out herewithout any Mission Certificate, or License topreach.It was formerly the custom to sustain thegeneral and mission authorities at our districtas well as mission conferences; but has forsome cause been discontinued. What would beyour feelings and wishes in the matter?I understand that the original Maori formor ceremony of marriage is for the parents orrelatives on both sides to come together and mu-tually consent to the proposed or desired union;or, if between influential parties of differenttribes, the chiefs of the respective tribes wouldmutually consent; and the parties begin livingtogether as man and wife.In some parts of the mission the bretherenare wholly ignoreing the Maori form of Marriageand disposeing of unions thus brought about ascases of adultery and fornication and making 
 We were a little disappointed to learn it would be necessary to make shift, for the present, with the help we have, no more missionaries having been called for these parts; however we don t wish to complain, but will be pleased to accept more when you see proper to send them. In view of this Elder Andrew Smith Jr. has been released from the Presidency of the Tasmania Conference and appointed to preside over the New South Wales Conference which will locate him at Sydney, and suburbs. He has had some 18 months experience on the mission and is an able, energetic laborer, and we think will fill that position with credit, though it was with some degree of reluctance that we moved him from his former field.Two Elders should be released in July next and seven in September. We would therefore be pleased to receive means in time for the nec-essary remittances.  25. per head is the usual allotment.Since last writing we have held four District Conferences on tour to the Wairarapa: per-formed nine baptisms, blessed perhaps as many children, celebrated a number of marriages and had a number of instances of healing, some of which cases had, to all human appearances,

 reached the very jaws of death.At our Annual Conference we had 28 Zion Elders present and about 500 saints and friends. The new building was opened with feast, ceremonies and dedication. Besides which in the four days ten meetings in the native tongue, for in neighboring European towns, and our Elders meeting. The weather was good, and the Lord indeed blessed us with a time of rejoic-ing, and we hope much good will grow out of it all.Besides your epistle we were favored by one from our beloved brother and former Prest. Wm Paxman and one from the Maori Association which assisted materially in making our Con-ference as success. The outcome of all was the location of the Conference there for the another year, and permanent invitations to come and go at will. In fact the leaders seem almost what we would call "Dry land Mormons" and I suppose held so on account of their position and desire for continued popularity and influence.I resume my travels through the mission attending Conferences, going, in about ten days,to South Island.We anxiously look forward to time of recieving 
 nan 
 them a matter of fellowship. I would be pleasedto hear an expression from you as to wetheror not the above is the proper course to pursue; oris the ceremony of the Maori nation in this res-pect entitled to the same respect and acknowl-edgement as that of other nations?Making such unions a matter of fellowshipmay have grown out of the counsel of formerPresidents to try and educate the Maori people upto a better ceremony in order to draw as broad adistinction as could be between marriage andliving in adultry; as perhaps half of the Europeanpopulation are doing, in some of the cities at least.Would it be improper for priest, teacher or deaconto perform the ceremony of marriage out here?We have a case here where one of our sisters mar-ried a radical, narrow contracted roman cathliceuropean. She sayes she refused positively to giveup her religion, and told him if he married herhe would have to marry a "Mormon" which she wasand would continue to be. He succeeded, however,in disgraceing her before marriage; and, seeming-ly would only be too pleased to have her excomuni-cated; but she earnestly pleads for secret baptism,as he wont consent to her being rebaptized, andpromises, as far as is in her power, to tend her

Ten meetingswere held in the three days with twenty-threeZion Elders in attendance, and between two andthree hundred saints and friends. The Elders meet-ing held on the 8th continued six hours and ahalf; and was one long to be remembered by allin attendance. The time was spent in singing,praying, bearing testimony, asking and answer-ing questions and in giving general instruct-ions, all were melted down until there was-ent a dry eye in the room.I expect to start south in a few days, holdingdistrict conferences down through and reachWairarapa for annual conference of missionApril 4th 5, & 6thWe are just now undertakeing to, locate Eldersat Adelaide, South Australia, where we hope toget an opening and do a good work; as the people,as near as we have learned, are of a nature intheir surroundings and occupations, thatought to take to the Gospel quite readily.I am not aware that any thing has been done as yet towards introduceing the Gospel
