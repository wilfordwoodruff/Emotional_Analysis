The cecession of South Carolinia, The Lord's coming out of his hiding place to vex the Nation, and many other things He was Followed by President Brigham Young who said I think upon the fulfillment of thes prophesies as much as Elder Taylor, but my Great concern is about the preperation of this people for those things which await them are this people prepared to dwell in Zion and the New Jerrusalem while they mingle with thieves, Blasphemers, drunkards, liars, and whoremungars, those who profess to be latter day saints are guilty of these things, and I have had hard work to hold myself From going through the Land and clenseding it from such characters I wish the drunkards were dead and buried they seek to dray drag away our children and destroy them, he said the young men said they would do as I told toldhem I will now tell you all to Quit drinking whiskey  and strong drink and your lying, stwareing, and stealing and many other things He spoke of the army that had come here for our destruction they were  in a trap so that we could handle them but many of the mormons had followed them around and licked the dust of their feet as it were and worshiped them andwhile if they had taken my council I would have made them Eat Mules legs and skin a gallee ie milk porage without any milk. they should have paid well for what they had and I would have had there Money and used it for gathering the poor saints and many things he spoke of he said the president of the United States James Buchanan was one of the greatest Liyers there was upon Earth He knew he lyed when he said that when he went into power the Mormons were in open rebelion against the U.S He said the Government was the most corrupt and rotten of any Government in the world and they were ready to be destroyed    ENDENTRY December 31, 1860 ~ Monday   31st I spent the day in the office Journalizing A cold Hoary Frost   ENDENTRY July 28 1860 FIGURES Young had to remoadle the sckeleton of the sermon before us After the  Prophet Joseph died, the Question was asked how will the Church exist and be governed now the Prophet is dead, will the Twelve lead if so  can they get Revelation, President Young took up this subject and showed what the privliges were of all the Saints from the least to the greatest, all saints male and female have the privilege of revelation, of inspiration, the spirit of God  the spirit of revelation. A Priest  after the order of Administering of Angels  will Angels administer to a man and visit him and not reveal any thing  to him No. then if Priests can have revelation cannot Aposttles  yes. Evry part of the Melchezedeck Priesthood from an Elder to the Presidency of the Church have a right to receive Revelations From the face of the Lord direct without the Administration of an Angel. Both Priesthoods are divided into classes as helps in the  Deakons  and teachers do to the High Priests are for Presidents to preside over different Branches and stakes and to administer in all the  ordinances of the Melchezedek Priesthood. The Seventies are special  witnesses orand apostles to go into all the world to preach the gospel unto all  Nations to Build up the Kingdom of God, and Esstablish churches in all the Earth under the direction of the Twelve Apostles they should call upon  the High Priest to come and preside over the Branches after they are built up  a Quorum of ^70^ Apostles when united are Equal in authority to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. The Twelve Apostles or traveling council are to be  special witnnessese of the name of Christ in all the world they are Equal in athhority in there decissions to the Presidency of the Church they are to preside in all the world whare the three first Presidency are not. The three first  Presidency Preside over the whole Church and administer in all the ordinances of the Church, which consists of a President and his  two keys of the  sealing powers and his council act in concert with him in all things should the Presidency die The Twelve could organize another Presidency  and should the Presidency and Twelve all be slain the seventies being  Equal in power and Authority to the Twelve or first Presidency could  organize both Quorums. A Bishop has two councellors there  is no difference in the authority of his councillors the 2nd has as much   ENDENTRY 28 July ^1860^ authority as the first. A Bishop should have his councilers with him  on the trial of a case in order to make it Legal as it takes three to make a Quorum. The High Priest could organize the Church in all its  parts if all other Authorities were dead for they have the Melchezedek  Priesthood out of which grow all of the Higher offices of the Church  An Apostle is the highest office in the Church and Joseph  Smith was a Prophet Seer and Revelator before he was baptized or  ordained, to the Aaronic Priesthood or had any Authority to adm- inister one of the ordinances of the house of the Lord. He was afterwards ordained to the Aaronic Priesthood then to the Melchezedek priesthood and Apostleship which is the highest office in the Church and kingdom  of God on Earth. When a man is ordained to the Apostleship and  keys thereoff if he dies in faith He will hold those keys to all Eternity  all the Prophets APatriarchs and Apostles who ever did or ever will  hold the keys of the Apostleship if faithful unto death will hold  them forever. President Young was an Elder when he was ordained  to be one of the Twelve Apostles some asked the Question how He could officiate as an High Priest not having previously been ordained  a High Priest Joseph said the Apostleship covered all the offices  of the High Priesthood, the same as a private member ordained a  High Priest could officiate as a Deakon Teacher Priest or Elder  President Young said "I ordained most of the two or three first Quorums of the Seventies and Joseph gave me vary particular instructions to ordain them all High Priests which I did when  a man is ordained an High Priest Seventy or one of the Twelve He can officiate in all the lesser offices of the Church whether He has been  ordained to that office or not. When I met with the Saints in  Nauvoo at the first meeting after Josephs death in defending  the true organization against Sidney Rigdon I had it in my mind all the time that there would have to be a Presidency of three  Appointed but I knew the people could not bear it at the  time and on our return as the pioneers from the valley I Broached the subject first to Brother Woodruff and afterwords  to the rest of the Quorum they received it and finally sustained it   I spent the afternoon in the office Journalizing   ENDENTRY July 29, 1860 ~ Sunday   29th ^1860^ Sunday I spent the day at the N H Felt spoke in the morning  I followed him.

President Young Preached in the forenoon a powerful discourse he spoke vary  plain with regard to the Gentiles. He followed Brother H. C. Kimball  all of which spoke much to the Edifycation of the people. I attended the  meeting in the afternoon and herd President Young deliver one of the most Edify- ing discourses I ever herd in my life. His subject was "what are the  pleasures of life." He spoke of Eating and drinking as being two of the greatest  pleasurs of the worlding but that pleasure ownly lasts while he is swallowing  He nomanated the various pleasures and a person would soon be saciated in  any of them but if a man Enjoyed the spirit and Holy Ghost  and the gift of Eternal Life it was like a living well of water within him. He was Happy all the time. I went home with President Young and took supper  with him. I also had a social conversation with D. H. Wells.

Snow  G. Q. Cannon of the Twelve met for Prayer when the following conversation took place President Young said the people of the United States had sought our destruction and they had used every Exertion to  perfect it they have worked through the Masonic institution to per- fect it Master Masons and they were  put to death by masons or through there instigation and he gave the  sign of distress and he was shot by masons while in the act, and there were delegates from the various lodges in the Union to see that he was  put to death {{and/he? damns them}} I hope to live to see the day when I can have power to make them do right they have got the blood of the prophets upon their heads and they have got to meet it. When President Buchannan and the U.S.  Government sent Col Utah it was with  the Express purpose to destroy the Church and kingdom from off the Earth  to put to death this people but the Lord sustained us and put them to shame  and confusion and to his name be the honor and glory. There are other Masons sent to this territory for the same purpose to Esstablish a lodge here  and try to get an influence with some here to lay a plan to try to murder me and the leaders of the Church but they will not accomplish it, now Brother masonery that he might Join in with them, G.

If Ever G Clements has a mission I want him to Feel like Brother Mills a year ago he would have thought it a great calamity to have been sent on a mission now he wants to go. Brother Kimball asked how it would do to send Dr Anderson on a mission President Young asked what for, he is a vary nice plesant man but he is thorough Infidel in his faith he had a talk with me  upon the subject and honestly acknowledged that he had no faith in spiritual things "I want nothing said out of the council about this.

He gave them vary good council told them  to be faithful and live thir religion, not to get cheated by speculators nor to be in a hurry to get married to those men who profess to save women by the whole sale but wait untill you get acquainted  with men and know that they are worthy and capable of being saved themselves there is no hurry in these matters. He gave the same council  to those who could understand English spoke of their Journey across the sea and plains that was calculated to bring out what is in you. Now go to  and repent of all your sins and get rebaptized and live your religin some  come here and expect all to be satisfied and perfect but they are not per- fect themselves and they soon get dissatisfied they look at the falings of  others and do not look at there own, but you should go to and be unit- ed with those who serve God and do right and you will be satisfied dont  be in a hurry to get rich, but do right and all bwill be well.

Brother Cannon said there was a learned Doctor blank that wanted to be baptized believed in this work but wanted to close up his business in New York City first said when he was baptized that He should lay aside his practice of medicine as he believed the Lord had provided means for the healing of his saints without the practice of medicine He is satisfied that the doctrin of the plurality of God and that Adam is our Father is a true doctrin Revealed from God to Joseph and Brigham   ENDENTRY 4 ^1860^ For this same Doctrin is taught in some of the old Jewish records which have never been in print and I know Brigham  Young have never had access to and the Lord has revealed this doctrin unto them or they could not have taught it. President Young said  if all that God had revealed was in fine print it would more than  fill this room but vary little is written or printed which the Lord has revealed when God restores the Priesthood and Apostleship he gives the keys to unlock the fountain of knowledge power and glory when An Apostle is called and ordained all of the keys of the kingdom  of God upon Earth are sealed upon him and God reveals heis mind  and will through that source to the children of men for the govern- ment and salvation of the children of men, and he reveals much in  evry age when the priesthood is upon Earth which is not written  or printed   FIGURE At about 3 oclock My Daughter Lorenzo Snow  was taken in Labor at 3 oclok was taken in LDelivered of a daughter at 15 minutes to 11 oclok she is doing vary well herself but her daughter was supposed to be dead when born the midwife put the child in warm water then in cold breathed into its lungs in it remained without breathing for 30 minutes it then began  to breathed and breathed quit freely but was vary feeble through the night    ENDENTRY September 5, 1860 ~ Wednesday   5 Phebe is quite comfortable this morning the child is vary feeble and it is quite difficult to keep life in it at about 12 oclok the child appeared dead Sister Zina Young was present and  took charge of the child she breathed into his lungs and done all she could and the child soon revived and sonon nursed I brought up Susan from the farm to nursed the child I Blessed the child and Named it Eliza R Snow and Sister Zina Young spent the afternoon with us and sister Eliza all night. the child lived till 9 oclock P.M. and then Breathed its last Sister Eliza laid it out    ENDENTRY September 6, 1860 ~ Thursday   FIGURE 6 We buried the child to day in my new lot No 7.

ENDENTRY September 9, 1860 ~ Sunday   9 I met with my Quorum in the morning I opened by Prayer Bishop G Q Cannon preached was followed by Capt Young they all spoke in the power of God. In the Afternoon President Young  delivered a powerful discourse to saint and sinner FIGURE He command- ed the Elders who were going on missions in the name of the Lord not to come home as merchants, or in carriages, nor to Bring home any silk dresses or any thing Els to theire wives or children nor to ownly have 2 shirts and pants to be descent and all they bring home as wealth let it ^be^ men, women, and children, let it be spent in Emigrating the poor many have gone to get wealth for their families but I dont want this done any more Now go to and gather the poor.  J. D. Ross spoke a short time the meeting was dismissed and all the missionaries were called to meet at the Historians office at half past 4 oclok. At 4 oclok President Young   with the Missionaries met at the Historians office. He asked the  missionaries if there was any one who could not go I do not wish to oppress any one there are a plenty of Elderss who are able and willing to go no one excused himself The names were then taken or called over to know who could fit themselves out and all were provided for. You Elders what do you think of  the commandment I give you let your carriages be filled with old men and women and you pull a wheel barrow, and if their is feble men and women put them in Hand Carts with springs and draw them in. Some of the Brethren sould not fit up and a contribution was taken up to Fit them up B Young $100, H C K $50, W Woodruff $25, D Spences $12,  70s Hall for a  Blessing meeting all the Twelve should be present. President Young made some remarks upon his commandments to the Elders He said that every   ENDENTRY 9th ^1860^ man that had gone out on missions and turned merchants they are not worth a groat, when they come home they are empty  in spirit and become beggarly poor. Brother P. P. Pratt began this in Erastus Snow and F. D. Richards came home merchants and they are poor and Orson Pratt came home in carriages and with silks and  satins and he is poor. He spoke in the power of God and sharply  rebuked the Twelve and Elders for their spirit of speculation  which they indulged in and when such Elders get home they  have not the spirit of God in them. He was followed by  H. C. Kimball  all bore testimony to what President Young had said was  true. H. C. Kimball refered to P. P. Pratt being in merchandize and would not trust him $5 and Yearsley said that He  would not trust H. C. Kimball nor God Almighty. We shall live while millions of such men are dead He bore testimony  in the power of God to what President Young had said. He said that the Elders had been like blood suckers from  Here to England, and it is time for it to be stoped, and let the women alone and not be corting them but let them alone. many bring home women and wandt the president to  soon seal a woman to him this will soon kill him  President Young then spoke to Orson Pratt and said that  the Book debt was the worst trouble the Saints handsd to  contend with for 6 years. Orson Pratt has done more  to make that debt than any other man so many Books  are forced upon the people and they are forced to take them  or they will not be fellowshiped notw stop publisheding  and geting your portraits taken and fill the kingdom with  them and make the people pay for them, this keeps the  people poor and keeps them from Emigrating. Brother Orson Pratt hade made some remarks saying that he had used  his own means and not any of the means of the Church He had got it all by his publications. President Young said it all coome out of  the poor saints Just as much as tho he had begged it. J V. Long  reported President Youngs speech which pierced the bones and marrow   ENDENTRY 9 ^1860^ and thoughts and intents of the Hearts of the Twelve Apostle and others of who were present He spoke the truth in the name of the Lord with great  power and sharpness and power He reproved the sins of the Twelve and others  in a manner which made them feel by the power of God the necessity  of walking uprightly before the Lord, and to be free from all sin. At the adjournment of the meeting we repaired to the Prayer room. John Taylor was mouth. (See privat Journal.)    ENDENTRY September 10, 1860 ~ Monday   10th I spent the day in the office the forenoon Journalizing and the afternoon looking over the mail matter for news but found but little.    ENDENTRY September 11, 1860 ~ Tuesday   11 I spent the day Journalizing and compiling History I came in at 3 oclk P.M. Found President T. Bullock reading to him the political  papers at the close of the reading I compiled History with Jaques    ENDENTRY September 12, 1860 ~ Wednesday   12 I spent the fore part of the day compileing History I spent the afternoon  watering my garden.    ENDENTRY September 13, 1860 ~ Thursday   13 I spent the day compiling History I attended the Bishops meeting  FIGURE President Young was Present and delivered one of the most powerful  discourses I ever herd from his mouth unto the children of men there was no reporter Present nor clerk to keep minutes. Brother Calder wrote  some minutes and I reported the following synopsis of the presidents remarks  Meeting opened by prayer by Hunter called the roll  and not more than half the Bishops present a part of the councillors. Bishop Hunter then called for teams to draw Adobies and sand. Also Enquired if  there was houses to rent, several was reported. A recommendatin was read from one of the Brethren as school teacher.    President Young then arose and said there is a good deal I want to say to the Bishops but I dont think I shall say much to you to night  I would liked to have seen all the Bishops here to night many are  absent. I shall speak of those things which we want now. The Bishops are the men more than others to attend to the Business of the Church in the Stakes of Zion. I have said a good deal at times against  the Bishops perhaps more than they thought was right. But I now will  tell you what I want. We have missionaries going abroad upon their  missions we are all acquainted with the situation and Locations of theis  country. The revelations says take neither purse nor scrip. that is go without  taking food or money, now this revelation wias given to the Twelve in Jerruselem a city filled with the wealth of the Nations it is like   ENDENTRY 13, ^1860^ giving the same commandment to Elders in New York City but  it cannot be Expected that Elders will start from this city to walk a thousand miles to settlements without food or to kill there game by  the way. But they have got to be supplyed with means to go to there  Field of Labor. I now want to take up a collection next sunday and the sunday following for the missionaries who are not able to fit  themselves out and I want the Bishops to see to it and attend to  it. I shall take up a collection for this purpose. we are in a land of  plenty we have a superabundance of means, now shall we send  out those Elders to beg of the poor saints who are already bound down with poverty to obtain all their supplies No we will not. I do not mean  that this people shall stay here in their wealth and sin any longer and send out Elders to preach and beg of the poor who have not means to come to Zion as they have done heretofore. I intend this people Hereafter shall find means to send the Elders to their fields of  Labor and if necessary to bring them back again. Our Elders  have had to beg so much frotm the people that they have bound  the Saints with chains of oppression, this must be stoped The  Saints in Zion must take this burthen off from the poor abroad  The people Here think they are vary good Saints but they have but one Eye open. The Elders of Israel here in Zion have  there minds upon thworldly matters and not upon the building  ofup of the Kingdom of God. they will go into the stand and preach  and get down and pray and promise the Lord what they  will do. they will get up and and a horse trade will make  them deny all they promised the Lord as the Elders advanc in the Kingdom of God did I say advanc No they do not  advance you will hear Elders get up in the stand and Exhort the people not to Quarrel with their Neighbors or abuse there wives or children. Now if the Elders were living their religion and walking in the path of Duty they would consider such  preaching an Insult and a disgrace to them, as they would be living above such conduct. The Elders and people are asleep  and there Hearts are set upon getting rich and the work of God is out of sight to them. Now I will say to you Bishops that  I dont care a groat whether you or the people do one thing or   ENDENTRY 13, ^1860^ not but I will warn you that if you do not go to and raise up means to assist in sending these Elders abroad and build up the  Kingdom of God. The Lord will raise up other people to do the  work which you and this people are called to do. any man who  holds the priesthood of God that commits sin and does not  magnify that priesthood He will have to pay the penalty and He  cannot Escape it. Now if the Bishops want to do their duty let  them go to work and raise means enough to help the poor Saints that  are going away. Bywater  and John L Smith and some others want some help to get away, and their  families will want help after they are gone and the Bishops must see  to them such men as Ormus Bates can take care of himself and  others can, but those who cannot must be provided for, you may  think that I am hard. But all I would ask would be for the Bishops and this people to see the things of God and his Kingdom as I do. But when I think of the situation of the Earth, and the price of the Earth  which is no less than the life and Blood of the Lamb of God, and when I think what the cost will be of the neglect of this people, their  worldly mindedness and unbelif it causes me pain. what is the  cost it is this Jesus Christ the Son of God our Elder Brother is at the  door and wants to come in and take possession of the kingdom and reign triumphant over his foes and you wont let him, this people are shutting up every avenue so that Jesus Christ  cannot come to the Earth. Can you see what it costs, it makes  my heart ake (while in this part of his speach he walked the floor  and his voice was like the voice of God) "all I will ask of this people is to see things as I do then they would act and not sleep. Now what do the Bishops know about their wards or what is going on in  there wards Nothing. Let me ask a Bishop how many grog shops have you in your wards I dont know. How many Hore Houses I  dont know. How many gambling shops andc I dont know, and so it  goes all through the Church some poor woman will call upon a Bishop  or some man upon business in the morning the Bishop says O dont trouble  me I must go to the canyon for wood I dont want to be trouble though  I am your Bishop. Bishops do not magnify there calling in thes things Now  many Bishops are there here to night out of the 20 wards in this city not many   ENDENTRY 13 ^1860^ How much tithing do we receive of the people in this Territory  not one bushel of wheat in a hundred which is our due, not a tithing  of what we ought, and we have had to use much which we have  received as tithing to build roade up provo Canyon and other places  now we cannot get tithing in any thing which the people can  sell for money. Now if some man would appear on these streets  and offer cash for wheat, we would not get one bushel in a thousand  Now there has been $500,000 dollars worth of Freight annually  paid for goods brought to this Territory. in 10 years there has been  $5000000 dollars paid for goods now how much of that had  ought to come to the tithing office $500,000 dollars Now I will say to you Bishops if you feel to lay this thing before the people I want  you to say to the people Bring on your diemes shillings half dollars  Dollars half, Eagles, Eagles Twenty Dollar peaces Fifty dollar  peases and send these Elders to their field of Labor. I will  now tell you how much the Elders in England have spent of the  tithing money. They have spent $54,0470 $27,035, each year  now I want this stoped. From the day that P. P. Pratt commenced  Begging in England up to the present time there is not one of that class of Elders but what have become beggars and Hell is full of such Elders and I dont care how soon the rest go there. I  went there and Esstablished the work and all the means I got I spent  in Emigrating the poor. I have said that I would sell evry scents worth of property I possessed in the world for two thirds of its  value and give every dime of it for Emigrating the poor saints now  let any man or company of men come and Byuy my property and  I well give it to Emigrat the poor, and I will begin without one cent  and in 10 years I will be worth more than I am now. I will stop this begging in England if I can and I think I can do it. you  Englishmen cannot you see the poor saints starving in England  and yet our Elders will beg the last cent they have got. This subject has pained me for years But I have never had the power untill now to handle it I now have the power and I will use it  thank the Lord. Other remarks were made by the president. I arose  and bore testimony to what President Young had said. The following  are some of the remarks I maidde   ENDENTRY April 25 vary Edifying manner among other remarks He said "I want you to  go upon your mission in the spirit of God you will do more good by bearing testimony of the work of God through the Holy Ghoost than all the argument you can use you may take two men one may be vary learned in all the arts and siences of the day and be able to preach a Bible and a half in one serman and the other man may be ignorant of these  things but be filled with the Holy Ghost let one preach by his learning and argument the other by the Holy Ghost and the man that preaches by the  Holy Goh^o^st will make ten saints whare the other will one. I do not wish by these remarks to lay one straw in the way of any of the Elders obtain- ing a knowledge of the Arts and sciences and being armed with truthful  arguments upon evry subject, the Elders should sbeek diligently to obtain  all knowledge in their power but they should obtain the Holy Ghost to  assist them in their ministry. Unless a man can fell feel that he administers the ussues issues of life and death unto the people he does not magnify his calling as an preached the Gospel  and he preaches it in the demonstration of the Holy Ghost according to his calling it will prove a savior of life unto life or of Death unto death to those who hear.   Some of you are going to visit your relations now when you get whare your relatives are dont set down at your  Ease and give up preaching but remember that you are on a mission and  you should improve your time   You will have all manner of Evil  spoken against you and all I ask of you and all that God or angels will ask of you is that not one word spoken against you will be true but  that it shall all be fals and I want you for your own sake, my sake and  for the sake of Christ and the Kingdom of God that the wicked shall have no cause to speak one word of Evil against you And if you will go and not let down one thread of your calling but do your duty in all things I would feel perfectly safe in warranting all of you  a safe return home some have died while on there missions this  is lamentable For it is unnecessary For if an Elder goes and  does his duty in all things there is no neccesity of his Falling by  the way. another subject I wish to speak upon and that is about your  beging upon your missions. I do not wish you to beg but trust in gGod  and not have it to say when you come home that you have robed any  one or taking any thing unjustly from any one go and preach the gospel  Faithfully and trust in God and He will give you all he has for you   ENDENTRY 25th April 1860 There is another vary important subject which I wish to speak of and that is the Temptation you will have From women this has caused the  down fall of more Elders in this Church than any other thing there is  some Elders who go on there missions all there lives and keep them- selves clean and pure all there lives others comes home and are shady  there countenance Falls they cannot look you strait in the Eye they  fallen in the snare. Joseph said in speaking to the First Twelve that  they would have to watch against this snare For they would have more trouble From this source than any other now let evry woman  alon while you are gone, dont lay your hand upon any woman, but  keep yourselves clean some have to bring a group of women with  them they have to get a new dove into there house while they are gone  let those things alone while abroad, but what is done upon that  subject let it be done here.    While abroad you will meet with  many who will want to debate with you but dont contend with any man but make a Bargin with such men and tell them if they have one  truth which you do not possess tell them you will exchange ten  Errors for it if you will show me I have them.   I shall meet with you tomorrow you will have a letter of Instruction  redad and I want you to observe it you will have prayers in camp there  must be no swareing nor contention you may think this or that  one does wrong but impute it to the Error of the Head and not the Heart  I have Appointed Joseph W Young to preside over the camp going  down I dont want you to Hurry him those teams have got to come  back again, you will be carried with your provisions Free But I  want you to assist the Teamsters about getting along. Ther must not be any abuse of cattle I have never permitted this in any company  I have had controll of I will never permit a man to abuse a dumb  brute yoaked or Harnessed up that cannot get away or speak for  himself but if a man wants to abuse any thing let him striken a strong man that will knock him down in return but dont abuse a dumb animal. At the close of the remarks Erastus Snow dismi- ssed the meeting I walked home with Capt Gibson took supper with  him and conversed with him for some two hours concerning his mission  Former life. He remarked that the 25 April was a vary Notable  day to him He Escaped From his prison in the Island of Java He  arived home at South Caralina and and met with a warm   ENDENTRY 25 1860 demonstration of his townsmen on the 25 April.
