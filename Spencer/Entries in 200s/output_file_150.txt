 be adviseable to notify at least four new Elders to take their places, to reach here in Sept. or October.  I feel impressed to make a few suggestions in regard to my successor and yet I hesitate to do so least you  should think I am seeking a release for myself; I assure you such is not the case for I am enjoying my labors  and am perfectly willing to remain here and do all I can in my weak way for the advansement of the cause of God, till He is satisfied and His servants say it is  enough: what I wish to say is that when the time comes 
 could in a written communi- cation. I will just say that  our district, and the annual  conferences were all that we  could expect, and were in ev- ery way successful.  We continue to have  an occasional European con- vert, and the Elders could use  some European tracts to very  good advantage, if you would  kindly favor us again by send- ing another lot of them.  As Elder Stevenson  had intended returning by  Europe, but having changed  his mind, he has a surplus  of money; and not caring to  carry so much across with  him, has deposited fifty (50) 
 sionaries at as early a date as  March, for the work continues to  grow, new fields are opening,  and additional Elders will be  needed. The five Elders which  I wrote for last mail, please  send as soon as convenient, in  addition to the two sailing in  March.  Your instructions concern- ing the general fast day were  received, but not till after the  day appointed had passed. We  however, realizing also the benefit  of prayer, set apart one of the  days of our conference when we  fasted and offered our feeble  supplications to the Throne of  Grace in behalf of Zion gener- ally, and her leaders in par- ticular. It was a day of rejoic- 
 I think it advisable to send some one well versed in the principles of the Gospel; of good judgment, and a man of experience in presiding or sitting in judgment on diff- icultys arising among memb- ers of the Church.  Owing to their peculiar marr- iage relations their weaknesses and great adaptability to follow after the sins and follies of their wicked European nei- ghbors, curious and compli- cated cases arise which, as  one Elder said, would take the patience of Job and the wisdom of Solomon to settle,  as the Elders here are all young men and before 
 ing to us, for the spirit of God  was in our midst and we felt  assured that our Father would  hear and answer our prayers.  We mail a report of our  interesting conference to the News.  Truly we had a time of rejoicing  and we have not experienced a  richer flow of the spirit of testi- mony since we have had the  pleasure of laboring among this  peculiar people. Many of the  Elders have also been unusually  blessed in acquiring the language,  one in particular, who bore his  testimony quite intelligently in  the native tongue after a residence  of but four weeks among them.  The manifestations which we  are almost daily receiving are a  source of great consolation to us,

If you will  kindly order the equivalent of  this amount paid to him there,  you will favor me very much.  I am pleased to say  that the Elders are all well, and  laboring dilligently for the salva- tion of souls.  I will not add more  at present, as Bro Stevenson  will tell you the news.  The two Elders who  were expected last month did  not arrive. I hope there will  be some on this boat as they are  much needed. 
 coming are usualy without experience, they would natura- lly feel more confident to have an experienced head to look to and receive counsel from.  I submit these suggestions becaus I realize this is a large, important, and very expensive mission; beleiving that its future success depe- nds largely on the capabilities and influence of the presiding officer, and also through my great desire to see it continue to grow and prosper.  Our yearly Conference will convene April 4th, at which  we anticipate a large turn- out and a good profitable time; preparation's are being 
 and we know that God is with us in our labors among this people.  Elder Wagstaff of whom we wrote as ailing, is now reported by his president as being complete- ly restored to health through the administrations and prayers of the Elders in his behalf.  Please excuse this short note as we are pupon a trip of about one thousand miles on horseback, and our time is very much lim- ited. Am pleased to say that we are all quite well in health and rejoicing in spirit, and unite in sending love and many blessings to all of our dear leaders in Zion.  Yours faithfully, A T. Wright.

 made on a large scale,  I will select one of the Elders to go to Australia as a com- panion for Brother Woolly, as I do not think it would be wise to leave him there alone in that dark and wicked part of the mission.  we are anxiously awaiting our next mail to learn the result of the Election in your fair City, but from the tone of your letter added to our for- mer fears and feeling, we can prepare for the worst ^and are^ ready to score the arch enemy another victory and say that one more scene in the great drama of spoliation has been and ended, we are all well with the 
 exception of one or two of the Elders who are suffering from colds contracted in this trying climate.  I wish to ask a question with regard to Half Caster. There are some here in the Church, who are quite light complected, who speak english fluently, have Euro- peans dress, manners, cust- oms, in fact have lived among the Europeans most of the time -- Should any of this class desire to emi- grate what would be your counsel in the matter.

President Wilford Woodruff and Brethren of the Council,  My Dearly Beloved Leaders:  I again take pleasure in addressing a few words to you, to report our condition and requirements in this remote part of the Lords Vineyard. I am pleased to state first that Elders. Thos. C. Stanford, P. P. Thomas, L. J. Hawkes, M. Bennion, and O. C. Dunford and wife arrived safely and in good health and spirits, by the last mail boat having had a pleasant and comparatively smooth passage. While on this subject, I will say that I think it would be best to discourage the Elders from bringing their wives with them to this field of labor, for really it is not a suitable place, nor have we proper accommodations for our sisters.  I was somewhat surprised at not getting notice from you of their coming, nor even a letter with them, and it was only by chance that I heard of their coming and averted what might have been quite an inconvenience to them, as it is almost absolutely necessary for some one to meet them here to assist them in making necessary pur- chases. etc  Will you be kind enough to send me about five more new Elders for this field, to fill the places of those which 
 ition to the purposes of God, and as his time is drawing nigh can we expect him to relax his efforts? We feel to say am- en to your testimonies regarding the final result of the work of God.  We thank the Lord that the saints are once more privileged to listen to your inspired concsels, and know they appreciate them as we shall do when once more al- lowed that great blessing. We feel to rejoice to know that we are remembered in your sup- plications to the throne of our Maker, and can assure you that fervent prayers are daily offered by the Elders and saints in this far off land, for your continued peace, health and general prosperity. 
 will be released in April. If they could come on the boat which leaves San Francisco about April 5th, it would be most convenient; if that is too short notice, please send by boat leaving second or third of May.  If you will kindly notify me a mail in advance I will appreciate it very much. I would like to have at least two of them qualified for school teaching, and if I may be permitted to suggest, I would say, that when selecting Elders for this field it would be well to remember that they have a new and difficult language to learn, and all books issued as helps to the learner, are on a grammatical basis, and therefore Elders who have no knowledge of grammar, find the study very irksome and the acquiring of the language almost impossible, consequently very discouraging to themselves and the native saints who are expected to provide for them.  The Lord has wonderfully blessed many of us, in our comparative ignorance of our own tongue, "But all have not the same gifts, though directed by the same spirit" [##Doctrine and Covenants 46:11##] [##1 Corinthians 12:4##]  With regard to the Australian part of our field of labor we have but two there whom we can depend upon as laboring Elders, the third one (Brother Bromley) is visiting relatives, and as one of them, Brother Chip- man, will be released in April, it will perhaps be necessary to send some elders there. That is if it is intended to continue the mission. I suppose though 
 Since my appointment to the  high and responsible position as President of this mission, a calling which I by no means feel capable of magnifying, I have been attending conferences and laboring among the outsiders in the extreme Northpart of the Island.  I am sorry to say that our  labors were not crowned with much success, owing princi- pally to the united and persist- ant efforts of the clergy. They are continually warning the people against us, and in so- me withplaces we could with difficulty get places to sleep, and having in many instances, the doors closed in our faces.  The Maories are naturally a hospitable people, but the lies 
 that President Paxman has reported its conditions, and suggested to you its requirements.  From a recent letter received from Elder Chipman, he represents the people as being very indifferent, and that after thoroughly advertising in daily papers, post- ing circulars etc., that but perhaps three or four strangers would come to their hall, and it reminded us forcibly of our late experience in trying to interest the Europeans of Auckland and suburbs. He reports but one baptism in the past three months. I am pleased to report that the work progresses favor- ably in this part of the mission, though we have many things to contend with, the natives being so weak, and we are occasionally obliged to take action against members for their persistent evil practices, and particularly for their running after the Moari priests, or workers in witchcraft and Moari superstitions  We recently visited a small neighboring island and God so blessed us that we were permitted to add 52 souls to the fold. We were met and opposed by satan who took possession of one of the females there, but by the power of the priesthood of God, and in the name of his Son, he was cast out, the afflicted person baptised, and we all rejoiced in the great testimony which was given to us.  From our home papers we learn of the excellent

Pleased to hear that we  are soon to be reinforced with  new elders and will make it a point to meet them in Auck- land, to welcome them to maoridom.

 conference which was enjoyed by yourselves, and so much appreciated by the saints in Zion generally; and it makes our souls long for the time when we can again assemble with the saints and enjoy the outpourings of the Holy Spirit, as I well believe it was in your late conference  We were pleased also to learn that the quorum of the Twelve was filled, and from our personal know- ledge of the majority of the Brethren selected for that high and important calling, can say it was an inspired selection, and we all can, and do, support them with our faith and prayers.

 the fares are the same from San Francisco, and in case one or more should be wanted for the Australian field it would avoid the fares from Auckland there, which are  five pounds.  I was made very happy by receiving my release, not entirely because I could return to my home and friends, but I also realized that I had about completed a mis- sion of three years and to know that I had been preserved from the sins of this untoward generation truly made my heart rejoice.

 Auckland New Zealand. May 29th 1890.  Presidents Wilford Woodruff, Geo. Q. Cannon and Joseph F. Smith  My Dearly beloved Brethren:  Your ever welcome letter of 28th ult. came duly to hand, and we were very much pleased to hear from you again, and fully appreciate your kindness in devoting so much of your valuable time in favoring us so often.  I pleased to learn that brother Taft had had so much clemency shown him and that there is an opportunity offered for such unfortunates to repent and again be restored to fellowship. I really feel, from my acquaintance and associations with him, that he will fully appreciate and duly merit the salvation which is now offered him through his repentance.  I was pleased also to learn that two  more Elders were on their way to this field of labor; I will have one of the brethren meet and welcome them to Maoridom.  There was one question I asked in my communication of March 19th, in regard to half-caste Maories emigrating 
 sustained by us, and we will take pleasure in labor- ing in accordance with your requests.  We are very sorry to report that it becomes nec- essary to release another elder on account of ill health; Bro. Jno. H. Timpson, of the 16th ward Salt Lake City, is the unfortunate one.  He has been in the field nearly two years and has suffered quite severely most of the time with a peculiar rumbling noise and distress- ing pain in his head, caus- ing deafness which in con nection with bronchial troubles has incapacitated him for his labors. 
 He, in connection with others of the elders, has exercised much faith, administered to ordinances, but without the desired effect.  He has been cheerful through all his afflic tions and will leave many warm friends behind among the maori saints. I will arrange about his return fare when I see you.  I have no Rail- way half-fare permits. If you can procure them for us, we would appreciate the kindness very much.  Please mail them, or any instructions, to me care of Grand Hotel, San  Francisco. 
 to Zion, which apparently was overlooked, as your answer contains no mention of it. I would like very much to have your mind on the subject, as there are one or two who are talking seriously of making an effort to get out of Babylon, and to gather with the saints in Zion.  The following Elders will be released to sail October 6th:  Charles Johnson, Jr. Grantsville, Joseph T. Waldron, Richville Morgan Co., John T. Smellie, Rexburg, Idaho. Joseph J. Jackson, American Fork Utah Co.  These brethren have been faithful labor- ers, and will have been nearly three years in the field. I think it advisable to release brother William Bromley, from Charleston Wahsatch Co., also, who will have been in  Australia nearly two years. I have previously written you however in regard to his case, and therefore leave him in your hands.  Please order a draft made in my favor, on the Union Bank of Australia, Auckland, for sufficient amount to allow the returning Elders the usual 30  each, less 
 Te Aroha, N. Z.  June 9th [18]90  President Wilford Woodruff  and Counsellors,  My Dearly Beloved Leaders:  I am sorry to have  to report to you, that  the bearer of this note,  Brother Heber J. Wagstaff,  who has been suffering  for some time with asthma  and symptoms of other  serious complaints has  suddenly been taken much  worse, and I deemed it  advisable to release him  to return to his home, where I trust with proper  care and treatment he  may again be restored  to health.  Elder Wagstaff,

 the 55 pounds now to your credit.  50  of the above was deposited be brother Ezra T. Stevenson, and the balance (5 ) is the remainder from the 30  sent for brother Smellie's return fare, 25  of which was  used by brother S. O. Taft.  The reason I write thus early for the return fares, I start next week on another extended tour in the country, and will proba- bly have no opportunity of writing for next mail. If the draft is mailed to come on boat sailing Aug. 23rd it will be in ample time, as I have sufficient now to send the fare to the Elder in Australia, if necessary.  The work is progressing about as usual. The Elders are quite energetic and the majority of Saints are rejoic- ing in the blessings of the Gospel: Many times the question is asked by them, "When are we to go to Zion?" "Why does not the  prophet call us to the promised land?" They are no exception, for they get the spirit of gather- ing, as do their white brethren, on their obedience to the principles of the Gospel.  Praying God to abundantly bless you 
 has been very energetic  in all his duties, and  is much respected by  the Saints with whom he has labored.  Elder Wagstaff has  been in this field nearly  twenty months.  I have given him  25 pounds out of what  I had on hand, and  must therefor ask you  to kindly add this amount  to the draft which I wrote  for last week.  Please excuse this  short scribble, as I  am very busy.  The  horses are saddled and  the Elders are waiting  for me.  We have just held

 (Recd 22 Dec. 1890.) J. S. Bingham  Ahipara, Nov. 20, 1890.  Prest Wilford Woodruff,  Box B.  Salt Lake City:  Dear Brother:  It affords me pleas- ure to again write you, and I  am thankful to be able to re- port myself and the Elders  in good health.  Since writing to you from Tautoni,  I in company with Elders Nye  and Cutler, have been down to  the extreme north end of the  island, visiting all of the native  villages, and have had the priv- ilege of bearing our testimony to  many who had never before seen  a Mormon Elder. As a rule we  were kindly received, and attentively 
 listened to, but in some places they  were so bitterly prejudiced by  mendacious reports circulated among  them by our enemies that they  would not allow us to hold meet- ings. Wherever we could get a hear- ing, I think we allayed much of  the prejudice and left the people  more favorably impressed with  what the world calls Mormonism.  At one place a European and  several natives desired baptism,  but as we did not think the na- tives sufficiently enlightened, we  advised them to wait till some  future visit of the elders.  There are some fine people in this  section, and I trust that they will  eventually accept the truth.  We are now at the house of  a Half Caste who has a European 
 wife and a large family. Tomorrow  we shall have the pleasure of lead- ing him into the waters of baptism,  and his wife being quite favorable,  we hope in time to baptize them  all.  Since writing I have heard from  most of the presidents of districts.  Several excommunications, are  reported but no baptisms showing  that the adversary is still at work;  not only in hardening the hearts and  blinding the minds of the outsiders;  but also in leading astray those  who have been initiated into the  truefold.  I have not heard from the breth- ren in Australia since Prest. Wright's  return.  Elders Heywood, Young, Nye and  Dame will be released to return home 
 next April. Please send us two new  elders to take their place. The mission  is well supplied with elders at present,  but I think it best for two to come  and be acquiring the language,  as another company will be released  about next October  A report is going the rounds  at present to the effect that a  manifesto forbidding the practice  of polygamy has been issued by  the President of the Mormon Church;  and ratified by a mass meeting of  15,000 Mormons. The newspapers are all  commenting upon it, and we are every- where plied with questions concerning  it. Having heard nothing authentic,  we treat this as a rumor of the same  nature as the hundreds of others  which are continually being put in  circulation concerning us, still we 
 would be pleased to learn from  you whither ^any^ action has been taken  to give foundation to such a report?  The spring has been unusually  cold and stormy, but it is now fine, and  becoming quite warm. The prospect  is that crops will be good, and the na- tives will have plenty of food next win- ter.  They are most all at home  at this season of the year and it is  an excellent time for the Elders to  travel among the outsiders, but as  soon as the season of cultivation is  is over they scatter out into the  gumfields, and it is hard to reach  them. We could not have chosen a  better time for our visit to this end,  as wherever they would receive us at  all we had crowded houses  There have been some riots of late 
 among the natives of what is known  as the King Country, and several  who are guilty of plundering stores  etc., have been arrested and are now  in custody. We are in hopes that  something will transpire to lessen  the influence of King Tawhio and  Te Kooti, the Maori Prophet, so  that their followers will accept the  gospel. As it is at present they are so  carried away by foolish vagaries that  they will not listen to anything rea- sonable.  The health of the Saints I believe  is generally good. Many are trying  to live their religion, and are mak- ing commendable progress in the  knowledge of the gospel, while others  I am sorry to say are yielding to  temptation, and returning to their "wal- lowing in the mire." 
 Some are becoming anxious to go  to Kiona, (Zion), but I think it quite  wise to help them here until they prove themselves worthy.  There are, no doubt, a few worthy  persons who, surrounded as they are by the contaminating influences of  the world, yield to temptation, while  under more favorable circumstances  they might perhaps endure faithful;  but in my opinion there are many  more who would eventually fall  away even were they permitted to  emigrate, and it is far better to purge  them out and have them here than  to take them to Zion. There is too much  dross there already. I find that many  have been baptized without a knowl edge of the gospel, and my experience  is that it is more difficult to convert  a person after baptism than before. 
 Most of the European Saints are la- boring with a view to going to Utah,  but some of them are in very poor  circumstances being destitute of all  comforts, and having barely sufficient  to sustain life.  I will not weary you further.  Hoping to hear from you soon,  and continually praying for the  onward progress of truth and right- eousness, I remain as ever  Your Brother in Christ,  J. S.

 Tantoru Oct. 25 1890  Prest. Wilford Woodruff, Box B., Salt Lake City.  Dear Brother:  It now becomes  my pleasant duty to write you, and inform you of my where abouts.  Your letter informing me of my appointment to the presi- dency of the Australasion Mission came to hand by due course of mail and was, it is useless to say, a great surprise to me. I feel very weak in having to assume so great respon- sibility, but I sincerely hope and trust that God in His infinite mercy will bless me with wis- dom, and bestow upon me all 
 other qualifications requisite to the proper performance of all labors and duties connected with the  management of His affairs in this land, as I earnestly desire to magnify my calling acceptably and for the interest of the mission.  Since the departure of Prest. Wright and companions for home, I have been traveling in the Bay of Islands District in company with Elders Nye and Hixson. We have had the pleasure of baptizing eight persons.  On account of scarcity of food and for other reasons we thought it not advisable to hold any conferences  in this part of the island, so I am traveling through the districts visit- ing the branches and speaking to the people as opportunities are af- forded. It seems that gleaning and 
 sifting is the process at present, as all of the natives have all heard the testimony of the Elders, and it is quite difficult to awaken any interest.  The Elders I believe are all in good health. Sister Dunford at last account was also well and per- forming her dutises as teacher quite satisfactorily. The school is well patronized, the present enrollment being forty five.  Prest. Wright with the compa- ny of Elders and Saints I suppose will arrive at San Francisco today, and ere this reaches its destination you no doubt will have had an interview with him and learned of the general condition of affairs in the mission  Bro. Geo. E. Woolley having la- 
 bored in Australia for two years, will be released to return home in January. Plese send by re- turn mail a check for thirty pounds to pay his return fare.  In replying to this, please ad- dress me at Shortland, Thames, Hauraki, and the month ^following^ at General P.O. Aauckland.

I am thankful to state that I am still well, and  that the elders, though some are not robust, are all able to  travel and perform their du- ties. The weather thus far this winter has not been so cold and stormy as it was last winter, and there has been less sickness and death among the natives, though a few have succumbed to la grippe  I very much regret to 
 report the release of Elder [redacted] for misconduct.  He through the weakness of the flesh yielded to the temptation of the adversary, and made improper overtures to a young Maori woman. He did not commit himself, but ac- cording to his own confession would have done so had a  favorable opportunity pre- sented itself. He seems fully to realize the gravity of his mis- take, and is suffering the most bitter remorse. It is a most de- plorable affair, and is some- thing that has been carefully guarded against ever since the opening of this mission among the Maori people as we fully realized how disas- 
 astrous it would be to the cause of truth should any of the  elders be found guilty of a  violation of the law of chas- tity among this simple-minded and confiding people, but the long dreaded evil has at last befallen us. Just how detrimen- tal this sad affair will prove we at present cannot tell, but I fear that it will be some- time before we regain that implicit confidence which the natives have hitherto placed in us as servants of the Lord.  We shall endeavor as we have ever done to show in the most emphatic way possi- ble our disapproval of such conduct, and fervently pray to God to counteract the evil influence that the

I have appointed him to a different field of labor, and if the change does not work an improvement in his condi- tion, I shall release him ac- cording to your instruction, as I am afraid that he will not stand another wet unpleas- ant winters unless he gets relief. 
 progress of His work in this land may not be im- peded  [Redacted] will be ac- companied by Bro. Christiansen and family, and I think by Elder Bromley, as I am in- formed by Bro. Cutler that he will go by this boat.  Prospects are not so bright in Queensland as when Elder Cutler last wrote me.  The elders accepted a chal- lenge to a two evenings' discuss- ion on the authenticity of the Book of Mormon. Their opponent was a leading minister of the Christ Diciples, or Camp- bellites, as they were formerly called. His arguments consist- ed almost entirely of a reitera- tion of the "Solomon Spaulding 
 Our annual conference was a most enjoyable one. Nine- teen Elders, Sister Dunford and about five hundred natives were present. The Spirit of the Lord was bestowed in rich abund ance, and harmony and good feeling raeigned. The Elders are unanimous in saying that it was the best conference that they have attended in this land.  A few of the saints were sick, but our Heavenly Father in His tender and loving mercy heard and answered our sup- plications in their behalf, and they were raised up from their beds of affliction. One young ^man^ who was very bad, and to whom we administered sev- eral times during conference, came 
 story" and ^a^ tirade of defama- tion against Joseph Smith and his associates. Our Elders it appears were not prepared for such arguments^?^, and did not satisfactorily refute his outrageous falsehoods and vindictive vituperations. Some therefore who were investigating our doctrines now entertain grave doubts as to the origin and genuineness of the Book of Mormon.  The Elders in that land are well, and feel determined with the help of the Lord to hold the field against the enemy, as they are confident that there are some honest hearts there that will event- ually accept their testimony.  I shall await the arrival 
 to prayers the next morning after its close and participated in the services by announcing and leading the hymn.  Owing to so many ^elders^ having returned home before their mis- sions were fulfilled we find ourselves with an insufficient  number of Maori linguists, and I was much perplexed in ma- king the appointments, but through the guidance of the Holy Spirit I arranged them in a way that I trust will be satisfactory and for the good of the cause.  Elders Rasmussen, Gibson and  Douglass reached this land in safety, and in time to be present the last two days at conference.  The vacancies are all filled, in fact we have too many

We are preparing to hold a conference in the Bay of Islands District on the 25 & 26 inst. This will be the ^first^ conference that we have been able to hold in the north end of the Island since Bro. Wright's return. If the weather is favorable we expect a good attendance, and hope with the help of the Lord to infuse a alittle life into the Ngapuhi saints the most of whom have  always been rather indifferent to the principles of the gospel.  As Sister Dunford since the birth of her child is not able to continue her efficient and highly beneficial labors 
 men in field I think at present.  The four Elders whose mis- sions are fulfilled were honora- bly released, and are now at Auckland preparing to sail for home on the 25th inst. All have labored faithfully and well and performed honorable missions.  One or two saints from here, and perhaps a few from Australia will accompany them, though ^I^ have not heard anything definite from Elder Cutler concerning them. Elder Jos. N. Heywood will have charge of the company.  Elder Nye reports a revival among the people of the Bay of Islands District where for the last two years the Saints or "Mormons" have been so cold and indifferent to the Gospel and the teachings

In addition to that which I asked for in my last letter, please send  55 for her return fare and that of Elder Roskelly which I have borrowed  Hoping this will find you and your associates in the priesthood well and in the enjoyment of all blessings requisite to your happiness, peace and prosperity  I am as ever Your Brother in the Gospel,  Jno.

 of the Elders. We have for some time past had grave fears that all of the Ngapuhi people would prove recreant to their sacred covenants, and forsake the gospel, but we now entertain hopes that a few at least will prove faith- ful. The condition in other local- ities remains unchanged.  Our brethren laboring in Aus- tralia have been somewhat crip- pled in their efforts to do good through a scrarcity of tracts with which to work. They have paid for the publication of a few out of their own pockets, but this in con- nection with their other expenses makes it rather hard on them.  I donot know how missions that are not self supporting are provided with such things, but 
 Auckland July 17, 1891  Elder Wm. Bromley arrived to-day per S. S. Alameda bound for home.  He is looking and feeling well having stood the hardships well for one of his advanced age.  Elder Roskelly and the saints who are going to Zion are expected tomorrow in time to take passage  I am informed by Elder Romney that Bro. Roskelly is sorely peni- tent, and I wish that I could save him the humitiation and disgrace of returning under such circumstan ces, but I cannot feel that it would be right to allow him to remain in the field. I am pleased to learn that his conduct has had no ap- parent effect on the Maori thus far.  I received today a draft for  30 which I suppose is to pay return fare of  Elder Bromley.

Any suggestions from you as to the best plan to adopt to sup- ly this want will be highly ap- preciated.  This has been a fruitful sea son in this land except in those  localities where the crops were greatly damaged or totally de- stroyed by floods which ocurred during the heavy rains which fell in the months of January and February.

Salt Lake City, Utah  Dear Brethren:  Your kind, interest- ing, and instructive letter un- der date of Jan. 7th came to hand on the 9th inst., and was perused with much pleas- ure.  In accordance with your instruction, I have notified Elder H. S. Geddes of his release, and have instructed him  to be prepared to sail for home by the vessel which leaves Auckland on Mar. 23.  He will be accompanied 
 by Bro. M. G. Korth and fami- ly, who are going to Zion.  The  30 for his return fare has been received, also that sent for return fare of Elder Geo. E. Woolley  In reply to your question in regard to my successor, I will say that of the Elders now laboring in this Mission I think that Elder J. P. Beck, of Paris Idaho, is the best quali- fied for the presidency. He is 23 years of age, is a faithful ener- getic laborer, quite proficient in the native language, and I think has a good under- standing of the Gospel. The time for his release will be next October. 
 Auckland Aug, 15 1891  Prest. Woodruff, Salt Lake City.  Dear Brother:  President Stewart and party arrived at Auckland on the 13th  inst. all in good health having had a pleasant  voyage.  I shall travel with him one month in the districts adjacent to Auck- land before taking leave of the mission and the saints of the Lord for my home in Zion. By that time he will have a suffi- cient understanding of the affairs of the mission to take charge thereof.  Elder Ephram Johnson of Brigham City of whom I previously made mention is still suffering and has lately made some disclosures in relation to his phys- ical condition of which I had been in igno- rance. His ailment is I think of such a na- ture as to warrant his release and return even though he retain sufficient strength to travel in  his field of labor. He has reluctantly accepted his release, and will accompany me home next

 Of those who have a longer time to stay, Elder Ephraim Johnson, of Brigham City I think would be the most ca- pable of filling the position  He also is 23 years of age, and has been in the mission nearly  two years. While not so fluent in the language as Elder  Beck, he is better qualified ed- ucationally. Physically he is not well adapted to the arduous labors of this office, as he is not nat- urally strong, and ^has^ now just recovered from a severe spell of sickness of forty day duration, which, but for the power of the  Priesthood, might have proved fatal.

 had any experience except what has been gained during their labors in this land, and being quite young they would not have as much influence with the natives as a more el- derly person would be able to wield. In my opinion, therefore, it will be better for the interests of the Mission ^if^ some person of  wisdom and experience be sent from home to take the presidency, especially if one could be sent who is already familiar with the Maori language.  At our Semi annual Con- ference held on January 9, 10, 11, Elder Heber S. Cutler was appointed to suceed Elder Geo. E. Woolley in the presidency of the Australian 
 District. He reached his des- tination in safety and re- ports all well in that land.  Elder Woolley was to start home via England on January 31st.  There have been no changes of special importance in the affairs of the mission since I last wrote you. The Elders are well, and are laboring with unabated energy to deliver that important mes- sage which has been commit- ted unto them.  Since writing the above, a let- ter from Elder Woolley has come to hand. He says that Elder Brom- ley, whose time is fulfilled, has no means of returning home unless 
 Opuawhanga, Dec. 18, 1890.  Prest. Wilford Woodruff, Box B, Salt Lake City.  Dear Brother:  It is nearly time  to post, but I desire to write you a few lines. I have waited until the last day thinking that there might have been something from you by the last boat, but my mail has not yet come to hand.  The Zealandia was three days behind time, and I having ap- pointments to meet, could not wait, hence the long delay in my mail.  As I was leaving KawaKawa I on the 10 inst. I received a telegram from Elders Gilbert Meikle and Joseph Roskelley, announcing their safe arrival at Auckland, and 
 he receives assistance from the Church. His brother in Melbourne, from h whom he expected pecuni- ary aid, turns to him a cold shoulder, and there is no one at home to whom he can apply.  Bro. Woolley feels that it is high- ly necessary that he be sent home, and I therefore take the liberty of laying the matter ^before you^ for your consideration.  Hoping to hear from you soon, and ever praying that the choicest blessings of God be bestowed upon you, I remain as ever,  Your Brother in the Gospel, Jno. S. Bingham.  Address  c/o P. P.

 John S. Bingham  Auckland June 16, 1891  Prest. W. Woodruff, Salt Lake City  Dear Brother:  Your welcome and  anxiously looked for letter of  April 27th was received on the  27th ult., and its contents were pe- rused with the usual pleasure  and interest.  We were pleased to hear  that you and your associ- ates were well, and that the  ravages of la grippe are abat- ing.  I trust that ere this time  they have entirely ceased  The health of the elders in  this land and that of the saints  in general is good, and as for  myself, I enjoy the best of  health continually not having 
 asking for instructions. It was quite a surprise to me, as I had received no intimation that there would be elders by this boat, and consequently had made no arrangements whatever for anybody to meet them at Auck- land  I instructed them to go to Hau- raki, and remain until conference to be held on January 9, when they  will be assigned to their fields of la- bor.  These will be sufficient to fill all of the vacancies that will be oc- casioned by the release of the next company of elders, therefore it will not be necessary to send us any new elders in April.  Several of the Elders here have been in rather poor health of late.  Bro. Ephraim Johnson was quite bad

 been disqualified one day  through sickness.  At this season of the year there is usually a great deal  of sickness among the natives  occasioned by exposure to cold  and dampness, but thus far  there has been but little a- mong the saints.  I was much pleased to  hear of the appointment of  Elder Wm. T. Stewart to the  presidency of the Australasian  Mission.  I think it a wise  selection and one that will give universal satisfaction a- mong the Maori saints.  By them  Bro. Stewart is held in high es- teem, and they never weary  of speaking of his many  merits.  I think it will be best for 
 for a while, but at last accounts was improving. Elder J. H. Burton seems to be troubled with some pulmonic aff[l]iction and unless there is an improvement in his condition, I am afraid that he will not be able to stand another winter in this wet climate.  I am in receipt of a letter from Elder Geo. E. Woolley, who in connect- ion with Bro. A. L. Young is laboring in Queensland, Australia. They have succeeded in making an opening and present prospects are favorable.  Bro. Woolley is quite sanguine that a good work will be performed there in the near future.

For some time I have felt  impressed to explain to you  the situation of the mission and  make some suggestions in re- gard to the number of elders  required, that you might be  governed thereby in sending el- ders to this land.  Knowing that  the time for my release was  drawing nigh, I have deferred  writing, thinking that I could more easily explain the sit- uation verbally than by let- ter, but as some time will e- lapse before I see you, I  now submit my views for  your consideration. 
 accomplished. The people take no in- terest in the gospel, there are very few opportunities for holding public meetings, and very little can be done except by means of tracts. Having no tracts with which to work at present, they are at loss to know how to proceed. I think that we have a few English tracts at Auckland which I shall send to them when I reach that point  Elder Woolley will start home in January via England. I shall send an Elder from here to take his place.  Please send us a check for  120 to pay return fare of Elders J. S. Nye, J. S. Dame, J. N. Heywood, and T. C. Young who will be released to return home in April.  Since writing you, we have re- ceived the Deseret News containing the report of the October Conference in- 
 When Prest. Wm. Paxman was  laboring here, the harvest was  great and many laborers were  meeded, but since that time  the harvest seems measurable  to have passed, and at present  there is but little desire on the  part of out-siders for the gos- pel and little opportunity to  labor among them.  The mission is divided in- to districts or conferences, with  towo or three elders in each  district.  Some of these districts  are quite small with no  apparent prospect of becom- ing any larger, and the el- ders being compelled to spend most of the time among the  saints, become rather bur- densome.

Notwithstanding the many reports containing it that had previously reached ours ears, it was a great surprise to me, as I could not believe that such an action had been taken; but while I deeply regret the necessity of such a move, I accept it as the will of God, and feel to give it my sanction, as do also all of the Elders with whom I have had the privilege of conversing on the sub- ject.  It seems to be one of the great tests of the latter days, and doubtless will prove such to some of our people; but at present it apears to be more of a trial for our enemies than anyone else. Although it is 
 can be conveniently done, and the number of elders diminish- ed, I think it would be much better for the interests of the mission. I am confident that as much would be accom- plished, and the elders would labor with more satisfac- tion to themselves and the saints. Besides this, there would be a great saving of time and means.  On Poverty Bay and Warapa Districts, for instance, there are five elders where three at the most are sufficient  I have thought if sending two elders, or one elder and a native to Chatham Island to try to open the mission there, but thus far I have not found it practicable.

 what they have been so long clamoring for, it now appears to be exactly what they did not want. It shows them up in their true light, and reveals to the world that their mad crusade is not against one single principle of our religion but against all, that their real object and desire is po- litical domination in the Territory, the plunder of the hard earnings of the Saints and the utter extinction of the "Mormons" as a people.  I trust that the Lord will bless his people with a spirit of humility and wisdom that their faith may not wa- ver, but that they may yield implicit obedience to all of his laws and com- mandments thus bringing about their own deliverance from oppression.

Dear Brother:  Your much val- ued communication under date of March 30th has been received. Its contents were pe- rused with much interest and highly appreciated, as are all of you instructive and en- couraging correspondences  I regret very much to learn  of the death of President Daniel H. Wells. But while we mourn his loss, there is great consola- tion in the assurance that having kept the faith and fought the good fight, he has gone to the realms of bliss where 
 he can rest from the toils and trials of the the flesh while he enjoys the society of holy men of God, and mingles his voice in council with those who have preceded him to the mansions of our Heavenly Father.  I am pleased to state that the Elders are in the enjoyment of sufficient health and strength to be able to perform their du- ties. Elder J. H. Burton, whom I mentioned in my last as being quite ill, is now much better and is pursuing his labors as usu- al. I think he is troubled with asthma, and this heavy damp atmosphere is quite severe on him at times, but I trust that by being cautious he will be a- ble to remain until his mis- sion is fulfilled which is his 
 earnest desire.  Your letter of Oct. 15, 1890 has not come to hand, and conse- quently I did not received any instruction concerning the re- lease of Elder Wm. Bromley un- til receipt of your last. I have borrowed  30 to pay the expen- ses of his return, and have sent him his release. Owing to a de- lay in the transfer of the mon- ey, I think he will not be able to start home until June.  I do not know of any one to ac- company him. I have written El- der Cutler to advise him to wait till he can have company if he thinks it unsafe for him to go alone.  You did not state whether you sent a check for his return fare. 
 News from Australia is still somewhat encouraging. Infor- mation has been received from Elder Cutler of a few new baptisms, and prospects are favorable for the per- formance of more work. On this is- land also the Europeans are begin ning to accept our testimony. Within the last month eleven have been baptized, and many others are investigating. Opportunities to hold meeting with them are increasing  I trust that a good work will yet be performed among them.  With an earnest prayer for the on- ward progress of the work of the Lord, and hoping you are all well,  I remain, Your Brother, in Truth, John S. Bingham.  Ad. General P. O. Auckland

Salt Lake City, Utah,  Dear Brethren,  I anticipated a remittance of 3 returns fares ( 90.0.0) for the last three Elders goining home, viz H. D. Haight who sailed Feby 27, John H Burton who sailed Apl 23rd and Jos S. Groesbeck who left for home by way of Europe on 30th of last month; These Elders have all filled good missions in this land. In returning them I had to borrow of Bro. Hardy  40, which with the  50 which was sent me some months ago made up the Sum. I hope it will not be longer than another month till I can pay him.  Enclosed please find the Statistical Report of this Mission which I have not at present an opertunity of comparing with the last one, but will say that it like previous ones contains names which should be eliminated to the extent of consider- ably reducing the total, by increasing ^the^ deaths & excom- munication totals, as numbers who have been  baptized have went off and never returned, having either died or apostatized, but it will be some time before this can be regulated so that the reports 
 will correspond closely with our exact numbers.  Our Anual conference was held at Te Rahui Waiapu Valley which is at the Eastcape. The Southren districts were well represented, but only the Elders came from the northren. Our meetings were well attended the large carved Maori house being crowded in nearly every meeting. It was held on the 8th 9th and 10th of April. From the reports and my personal acquaintance can say, that while the numbers in the mission have been decreas- ing, yet many of the Saints are increasing their faith and diligence and are not near the children in understanding they were upon coming in to the church, anvery many of them have kept themselves Straigt. I am happy to say, since they first received the Gospel, and give promise of being so unto the end and Shows the results of the good labors in this land not only of those "who planted", but those who have been "watering", as well as manifesting the Grace of "God who giveth the increase" and is a source of Joy and thanksgiving to those who labor here. We have been much troubled with the vice of gambling, ^especially on horse races,^ amongst this people, and where they have been dealt leniently with in this matter it has generally resulted in drunkeness, adultery, etc. In endeavoring to stop it, some have been excommunicated, where they 
 have defiantly persisted therein, in the district where the latter course has been pursued and it has been nipped in the bud, success has seemingly attended, and this evil is well under hand ^in those districts^ at present And the Elders generally feel that it is the better course to pursue. Yet our home mail brings news that this evil is rappidly on the increase at home, and those indulging therin, does not seem to be called in question; In fact it appears that some who should be examples to the people because of their position's are leading they way. And the question naturally arises in our minds, wether we are justifed in dealing with this people for this offence, when it is not a question of fellowship with the ^more experienced^ Saints in Zion.  The Saints here were anxious to have the Doctrine & Covenants translated into their language, but when I gave them your advice upon it they seemed willing to let it rest, but asked if the Ready Reference could not be printed in their language I told them I would refer the matter to you. And will added that if it was printed with the Book of Mormon references, which are in small type figures in the compendium, it would no doubt be of much benefit to them and to the Elders laboring here. 
 In Australia four Elders are laboring, but with little success further than keeping a live the few members in that vast country, and warning the wicked inhabitants thereof. Two labor in victoria and two in Queesland and at last report ^in^ both places they were keeping bachelors hall when at head quarters. The few Saints in that land appear to be very poor and scattered, and the greater part of them very week in the faith. And it is really questionable in my mind whether we ought to keep that part of the mission up  If you could send me a few hun- dred blanks forms ^for^ Statistical ^reports^ they would be much appreciated.  I believe all the Elders in the mission have good health, at least so far as I know, and those on this Island left our conference in good Spirits. I now have a very fair personal knowledge of the condition of the Mission, having visited most of the branches to do which have traveled about 3000 miles by on  horseback and several hundred by Steamer and rail. And while some of the districts are in a bad condition, upon the whole we have much to Encourage us.  Ever desiring the welfare of Zion and the triumph of truth, I am, as I ever hope to be, obediently yours.  W. T. Stewart. 
 Te Hauke, New Zealand, April 12th 1893.  Prest W. Woodruff, Box. B. Salt Lake City.  Dear Brother,  Your favor of Feb. 27th came duly to  hand. The Elders referred to therein arrived safely,  and were present at our Conference, just closed.  The two drafts, for  91.12.8, and  10.1.3, came to  hand, and were duly forwarded to the Bank.  The notice of reduction probably is too late to apply  to Elder H. B. Dalling, in Australia, as I had  previously sent unto him his fare from the amount  on deposit. In relation to the reduction I beg to  submit that the amount ^named^ would be sufficient if  parties ^were^ sailing from Auckland or Sydney for Salt Lake, but releases most frequently find Elders in  their fields of labor, far removed from either of these  ports, requiring from  1 to  4 to reach either of them,  so that the former allowance left a margin ranging  from $ 25 to Nil, after necessary hotel expenses, in  Auckland & San Francisco, were paid, but, in cases  where the returning Elders resided far from Salt Lake  and releases found found them at the farthest points  from sailing port, even the former allowance was 
 inadequate. In cases where there has been a  margin of any considerable amount it has been  found almost indispensible, to enable the Elders  to make themselves presentable for travelling, for  which reason I have not felt justified in recommending  a reduction of the fares.  I hope to make arrangements with one of the  Saints, who is going to Zion this month, for an exchange  of money, whereby I will obtain sufficient funds, at  your last mentioned rates, for the return fares of  Elders J. M. Hendry, J. M. Hixson, J. G. Kelson and E. Atkin,  (respecting which I wrote you Feb. 13th) drawing an  order on you for the amount, viz: $500.  Should I succeed, the order will be presented to  you before May 17th. In case that it is not presented  at that date, you will please forward the return  fares for above-named Elders, but If, upon consideration  of the foregoing, you should deem it proper to  remit a larger sum, the balance may be forwarded,  if the above-mentioned order is presented.  I shall require four Elders to leave San Francisco, Aug 18th, amongst which, if possible, I  would like another of our old Maori missionaries,  who learned the language. 
 President Paxman will be able to advise you  respecting those who labored under his direction.  Elders Madsen, ^Dalling^ Hales, and Andrus will  return to Zion this month, accompanied by three  families of Europeans Saints, numbering about  17 souls.  A native brother and his wife have  importuned me very earnestly to permit them  to accompany me home, with a view of  permanently locating there.  The husband speaks enough English for all  practicable purposes, and is very industrious and  economical. They have been very exemplary  members since their baptism in 1884.  I feel that they would be contented and prosperous  in Zion, but do not wish to encourage them  without your permission, and I mention it  now, that, in case you sanction their gathering,  they can make preparations after your advice  reaches me.  Our Annual Conference has just closed  and all the Elders present feel that the Mission  is in a prosperous condition. 
 We had a large gathering and a good  spirit prevailed.  Enclosed please find our Semi Annual Statistical Report.  The health of the Elders is very good, and  all join in kind regards,  Your Brother in the Gospel,  W T Stewart President of the Australasian Mission.  P. S. Elders Oscar Andrus, H. B.

 Auckland New Zealand August 12, 1893  President W. Woodruff and Counselors Salt Lake City Utah, U.S.A.  Dear Brothren;  In april last I wrote  you enquiringly about a native who had impor- tuned me to allow him and his wife to accom- pany me to my home.  There was also another  native with wife & one child who had then decided  and is now fully decidedtermined to go to Zion as  soon as he can finish selling his lands and settling  his business. the latter one has already sent  200.0.0 to Utah investing in sheep, and sa short time ago  informed me that he had  300.0.0 more he  would like to send to put in sheep which business  he would like to follow. both of these speak English  good enough for all practicalble purposes.  There were two others a President of a branch and  his wife with two children came nearly going by  last mail Boat.  a failure to dispose of lands alone  prevented.

 Gisborne, New Zealand  Feby 14th 1893.  President Wilford Woodruff and Counselors. Salt Lake City  Dear Brethren;  The two letters  from Brother Reynolds containing  15.0.0 for  a brother Fryer, and $2500 in green backs for  Elder Nebeker came safely to hand.  We will  require four Elders to take the places of Elders  that will be released to return home about July 15th they should come by the Steamer which is booked  to leave San fFrancisco May 26th.  If a good  supply of Morgans Nos 1 and 2 and Richs "True  vs false Religion" ^Tracts^ could be sent out by these  brethren they would be very much appreciated  by the Elders laboring among the Europeans  And by the same mail will need return  fares for Elders J. M. Hendry, Jno G. Kelson J. M.  Hixson and Edward Atkins ( 120.0.0.)  The health of the Elders generally speaking is good, those in Australia find a  hard field but we have a few scattering saints  in that land, that it is necessary to look after 
 of others residing near him 2181 souls altogether  are making preperations and expect to leave  for Zion just after the April Conference, asking  me at the same time writes me for advice, and notwithstanding there has been a general discouragement to gathering throughout out the mission.  Yet a few of the saints in different parts seem  very anxious to go, and the Spirit of gathering  resting upon them seems irrepressable,  another  case I failed to mention is the mother of the  the maori boy who went home with my nephew  J C Stewart in 1886.  and is now a young man  living at Kanab, and quite able to look  after his mother and two younger brothers She has been deserted by her husband, and  suffers very much from asthma, but is one  of the most faithful of saints.  beleiieveing that  our dry mountain air would give her a new  lease of life and that naught but good can  possibly result from her goining I have so advised, but in her case only.  However I feel strongly impressed  that it will be greatly to the advantage of this mission  If a few here and there of the most faithful and  those best calculated to look out for themselves were  to gather out, that they may go there and become accustomed to the new conditions, thereby being a great  aid to those who should follow them yet a believe  
 Our native mission here is coming on, as  well I think, as we can reasonably expect. In our efforts to put down betting in all its various  forms your direct and pointed counsel has been  of great benefit carrying weight and influence  with the natives, and all ^thus far^ with with only one or  two exceptions have agreed to cease this vice which  have been depriving those engaging therein of a  free flow of the Holy Spirit. There is a marked  improvement going on with those who are faithful in this land.  Preparations are now being made  for our April Conference to be held at Te Hauke and the Saints and Elders are looking forward  to that event with much pleasure.  1893 has thus far distinguished itself, ^on th[e]se islands^ in the  peculiararity of its weather and the number of its earthquakes it has thus far produced. New Zeal- and has had a couple of miniture cyclones, whilst  in Australia unprecedented floods in some sections  and drougth in others have done ^an^ imme[n]se ammount of damage greatly increasing the suffering, desti- tution and misery which has prevailed there for two or  three years and the end is probably not yet for the inhabitants are reported as being in the  main anv ungodly, immoral set, many of them  keeping up no "form of Godliness" whilst the great  majority of those who do are "lovers of pleasure  more than lovers of God"  they seem to be   
 nan 
 rappidly preparing themselves for the wrath and  indignation of an offended God which will as  surely be poured out upon the unrepentant and rebelleous  inhabitants, ^of the earth^ as it has been foretold by the spirit  of prophecy and the revelations of the Almighty.  In the main the Elders seem to sense the  responsibility the Lord has placed upon them in by calling them to preach repentance and warn mankind. And are endeavoring to perform this  labor of love as the Spirit directs that their  garments may be free from the blood of this  generation.  We feel that the  Lord is still softening the hearts of the enemies  of Zion as is manifested by Judge Zanes recent  decision in the church suit, the granting of  am^n^esty, dismissing of old cases against our  brethren, and the general disposition of the press and people to deal more freely with the saints. We have watched with no little interest the recent political contest in our Territory and while we  regret the spirit of strife and bitterness manifested  by many of the saints when carried away with  the excitment of debate wherein crimination and  recrimination was indulged and offensive person- alities were substituted for argument, yet we think experiences of this nature are necessary, sooner or a later, are necessary to qualify the  saints to assume that high position among the 
 great care should be exercised in selecting those who  are first advised to go, to avoid if posible murmuring  and dissatisfaction on their part till they be come  thouroughly established.  I am satifed that the nations  of New Zealand, owing to the severer climate, poorer  soil and meagre natural productions of the country  they inhabit are naturally much better fitted for  residence in the valleys of the Rockies than the inhabi- tants of other Islands of the pacific where dwell  members people of this interesting race, whilst their  extensive associantions, and business intercourse with  Europeans for a generation will enable them to  readily assimilate with our people at home. all of the young men ^are^ expected here to earn their  own living even when the family's to which they  belong are, by virtue of lands, rents, or stock posesses,  comparatively independant.  The labor they usualy  seek ^is that^ offering the greatest reward and requiring the  most exertion. Such as Sheep shearing,  grass seed  gathering and bushefalling.  in these lines their  aptitude and phsiysical strength enables them to  eaisly compete with the white man,  in fact  none of them have ^any^ dificulty in finding work even  where the raks of unemployed whites are gradually  increasing.  The probably payout more for clothing  and nearly as much for groceries as the average  white labourer, except in those isolated 
 nations which they are destined to occupy and the sooner begins their political education the sooner will they be prepared but howe much better if the saints could avoid such unwarranted extremes, however those who will are saints indeed will come through all th[e]se experiences and acknowledge Gods hand therein and that his power and blessings are with his people and that the course of Zion is upward and onward desiring  to labor to that end and to keep pace ^there^ with.

[sideways text] ^2 more Elders^ [end of sideways text]  In addition to the  two companies of Elders sent for, if  Two more  could be sent direct to Australia, ^in Sept. or Oct.^ it would aid  very much in the work there, as a spirit of  enquiry is being aroused there as well as in other  parts of the mission.  The wall of prejudice & intolerence,  which have so long stood between the servants of  God and the hearts of the people, seem of late to  be crumbling away.  The impartial accounts, published  throughout this part of the world, of the Salt Lake  Temple and its dedication have contributed no little  to this end.  I have recently learned that Elder  Jas S. Abbott, of Annabella Sevier Co. Utah, who landed  here in Oct 6th 1892.  And of whose coming I was  duly notified, received his endowments in the Manti  Temple, July 22nd of that year.  Afterwards or Aug 18th he married a wife at Hinckley by Bp Pratt of that

I have felt  to present this matter before you as we view it from  this point of obvsersvastion, at the same time desire to  be guided in this, as in all matters, by your inspired  wisdom.  Prisident Reynolds letter of July 18th  notifying me of the intended departure of the next  two companies of Elders for this field ^has been rec'd^ I see  by the papers that a change of the time of departure  of the steamers of this line from Frisco will occur  in October next leaving there one week earlier  than time table date.

He says that  the President of the Temple, ^or whom he supposed, to be,^ advised this course after  he (Abbott) had related to him all the particulars of the  case.  He says also that "the Bishop of his ward and  Henry Clark of Richfield were both cognizant of  the circumstances."  I asked him if Bp Pratt knew  he had his endowments when he married him he  said "He could not say."  This matter being so  very irregular I cannot think but what some  blunder has been committed notwithstanding the  representations of Bro Abbott.  I therefore feel ^constrained^ to report  the matter to you and will anxiously await your  action thereon, as I have advised that he do no  ordinance work till the matter is cleared up, or  an authoritative explanation is received.  We have  been having an usually wet cold winter, rivers  flooded, and bridle paths in many places well nigh  impassable.  Notwithstanding which the health of  the elders is remarkably good, and their influence  is being felt for good especially among the  remnants of Israel in this land.

Beloved Brethren;  The last Sanfran- cisco Steamer being ^delayed^ did ^not^ reach Auckland till after the out going one had departed therefrom, thereby preventing me from acquainting you earlier with the safe arrival of Elders Goddard, Fisher, Palmer & Chipman all of whom I think will make good useful Elders in this field of labor. The Steerage accomodations were very poor on the "Alameda" and they were pleased to terminate the long unpleasant voyage. Elder H. D. Haight who has been honourably released from this mission to return home had left the wharf about an hour before their arrival  per "S.S.

I would like also to have Six Elders leave Sanfrancisco for this field of labor September 10th as we will be releasing about that number to leave  It would be well to select these soon and notify them J.

If this ammount can be  kept on deposet here it may avoid great inconvenience in the future.  It has been found necessary in the past, on account of ill health and for other causes, to return Elders home, before return fares could be sent for; Bro Hardy has been able, and quite willing for many years past to advance loans to the mission till we could obtain returns from home, but he is now talking 
 as clothing is about as cheap here as there, parties would do better to send the money instead, except in the case of "garments" only.  The health of all the Elders in the mission was good at last accounts. All have plenty to do. And while the immediate results of their labors, many times, are not very encouraging. yet upon the whole we feel very grateful that every thing here in the mission is ass prosperous as it is, for there are truly many good, warm hearted, whole souled Saints in this mission, but it requires wisdom given by God to deal with a people whose minds are so invironed by the traditions, ^superstions,^ and habits of their race, which are not readily comprehended by those not closely associated with them. The gospel is striking these fetters from their minds. their old priesthood with its witchcraft etc is fast becoming a thing of the past. The young men now work ^6 months^ on an average, each year for the Europeans at Sheep Shearing etc, most of them have entirely adopted european dress and many of them the manners and ways of their white neighbours. Free government schools are imparting the English language to the more ambitious children. So that it would seem not far away in the future when the remnant of the maori people will readily assimilate with the most advanced races of the earth. I believe the Maori is the most self reliant, industrious, and progressive of the brown polynesian races, which

It will be well to instruct the Elders in all cases where they are not met in Auckland to go direct to Mrs. Donnelly's ^our Boarding place^ Upper Queen St. where I will have instructions for them, provided I am notified of their coming a month in advance. Those of them who are accustomed to riding at home will find more comfort with an American Saddle than with any that could be bought here, but their Saddles Should not be too heavy. Such as can be bought in Sanfrancisco for about $2500 or even less will do, double rigged cinchas are preferable in most of the districts.  I am happy to say that at last accounts health of Elders in the mission was good though Bro. Young in Australia had just recovered from quite a severe illness. Yourselves, with aids & helps in government are always prayerfully rememered by us together with the Saints and especially those who feel much tried by the providential deliverance of Zion ^and her inhabitants^ in the Lords own way, which "is not as man's way"  Ever praying, and humbly laboring ^for^ the triumph of truth I remain, as I ever hope to be, obediently yours in the work of our Lord  W.

 of gathering with the Saints in Zion which will necessitate some such arra- -ngments as a deposit for the future.  I have sent for return fares for three Elders ^  90,0,0^ whichh I expect will reach here by next mail.  In regard to gathering half easts who have been raised as Europeans, etc. I will say, there may be afew whose faith and habits will justify us in advising them to gather, but not many.  There may also be a few of full natives whose faith, language and mode of living, some having incomes sufficient to keep them, would  warrant us in pursuing a similar course with them, but this class is also very limited.  In some dis- -tricts I find the gathering to be the principal theme of conversation 
 is due to the rigourr of his climate and the meagre natural productions of his country. his industry however was partially suspended while living on the proceeds of large tracts of land sold to the foreinger. but after exahausting his available lands he finds himself with new tastes & desires, that it requires considerable exertion to stattisfy. It seems the Lord has or will overrule all this to bring about a Speedy restoration of this branch if Israel to the lands of their fathers. Some of them feel very anxious now, for that event to take place.  I expect Elders Standord, Dunford, Thomas, Hawkes, who are laboring on this island and Young and Thorpe who are in Australia will be released to return home Novr 5th.

I believe they accepted my explanation of the Situat- -tion, especially when I called their attention to the fact that scarcely one of them had had their lands sub- -divided, receiving or obtaining crown grants therefor so they could sell them, thereby providing themselves withh means togather with.  I told them further that no doubt when they were fully prepared to gather that the Lord would open up the way for them to do so.

Dear Brethren,  Yours of Oct 14th conveying my release and the appointment of brother William Gardner to preside over the Saints in this part of the vinyard came duly to hand.  We feel much gratifedied over the privilege therein contained of a limited number of  the Saints being permitted to gather out of this land to the bosom of the church, and feel that in the main it cannot but result in much good not only to the majority  of those who go but to the work in general throughout these islands. As to their location in the Kanab country, there is probably no place in Utah, where, climate and everything considered, ismore suitable. And as to the continuation of my  labors in Zion, for the benefit of this people, I can say,  that to do the will of the Lord is my only desire, whether it involves duties naturally pleasant or otherwise, in this case it will be a pleasure to me to render any service I can to this people with whom I have been so much associated, and in whose interes welfare I have felt so  deeply interested.

I have now visited every native district, in some of them the Saints are in ^a^ reasonably fair condition, but in most of them, there seems to have been a reaction set in which will be found, when a proper census can be had, to have greatly reduced our numbers, Some of these short lived ones appears to have come ^in^ more through the example of thier chiefs, than a personal conviction. whilst others appear so addicted to- sin and powerless to refrain therefrom that it is utterly impossibly ^for them to live the law.

 to go within a month from to day, the date fixed for my departure, I can not at present say. As recent legislation by the N. Z. Government has made it much  more dificult for them to advantagouly sell their lands, limiting their purchasers to the Govt which of course need only to give what they desire and which has usually been much less than real value.  Brother Gardner is undoubt- edly well adapted and peculiarly fitted for native work, and will doubtless, in his ^extended^ labors, justify his selection for this work.  Your instructions concerning reports have been noted and we will endeavour to place ourselves in harmony.  Elder Hamblin has been much afflicted in his                                                     eyes, so much so, that outdoor ^work^ seems very unwise, if not,  impossible for him. I therefore feel it proper to release him to return to Zion, he will probably be under the doctors treatment till Decr 30th the date of his departure, his return fare can be sent to Prest Gardner whose address will be same as mine.  With the exception of Elder Hamblin the Elders are all reasonably well. Elder Gardner                                              only reached here last night and joins me in  kindest regards.

 Auckland  New Zealand Oct 29th 1893. Pres W. Woodruff and Counselors Salt Lake City, Utah  U S. A.

Opportunities for doing effective ^work^ among the Europeans of these  lands have, certainly, never been so good, during the last  12 or 15 years as at present.  Prejudice melts away much  more readily at the approach of truth than formerly and,  everything bids fair for a good seasons work. Notwithstanding your kind response when asked for tracts we have  been much handicaped for the want of these convenient little  messengers to introduce us to the people.  and have ordered  several thousand from Liverpool.  but should you advise  us to go a head with the purchase of a press, I think that  in a short time this difficulty will be overcome.

As to their temporal condition they are in the main rappidly becom- ing poor which as long as they re- main in this land I cannot regard as being detrimental to their spiritual advancement, as it forces them to activity and lessens the^i^r opertu- nities for evil associations.

Many of the Elders who come here never learn the language good and some of them scarcely at all as a rule those who are fluent speakers in English succeed well  in the Maori. If they could be selected for this mission with regard to their natural abillity  to acquire a new language no

Dear Brethren,  Elders Ridges, Young, and Johnson arrived safely by the last Frisco Steamer. Elder Ridges being appointed to the Australian district continued his voyage by the same boat, after a five hours rest in Auckland.  We will require ^by return and mail,^  60.0.0 as return fares of  Elders R. G. Miekle and D. B. Stewart whom we expect to  release to go home by the next departure of the "Monowai," which will be Decr 28th.  "The Ready References" have been prepared for publication  and placed in the hands of the printer, the first bound coppies  of which we may expect by the last of Decr. Money has  already been collected for the printing and by the time the first  lot is bound we will probably have enough in hand to  meet our obligations therefor. After the sale of the first  thousand ^coppies,^ it will be on a safe business footing.  We have agitated, to some extent, the purchasing of  a small printing press, for the purpose of issuing a paper  in the maori language, and, the printing of what tracts  we may need in the mission. The idea meets with univer- 
 doubt much better results would attend their labors in this land;  The health of the Elders here I believe is good without an exception. We are all much  grattified to learn that Prest Smith is once more permitted to mingle with the body of the church, and to minister the words of life and salvation to the Saints  Ever pray- ing the welfare of the Saints, and the blessings and the blessings of our God upon those whom he has chosen to guide and direct, I am as I ever hope to be your fellow laborer  W.

 sal favor among the natives and Elders. I think the  Saints here would subscribe quite liberally of their means  towards this end, both, for its establishment and maintenance,  however, we do not feel like moving out in this direction  without your advice, the more so as none of us have had  experience in this line of business. Should you feel to en- courage the undertaking, providing it can be made self  supporting, any advice as to kind, size, and probable  cost of press, will be greatly appreciated. Upon the receipt  of your reply to this, if favorable, the mission will be im- mediately canvassed and if the results warrant will proceed  at once to make arrangements etc., in which case we would want  a practical printer sent out, the younger the better, so he  could acquire the language, thereby, greatly increasing his useful- ness.  The measles have swept over this country, and,  though, usually very fatal with natives, who are ignorant  of its nature and proper treatment, the mortality has been very  light indeed, as compared to its former visits to these Islands.  The general health now, of both Elders and Saints  is good so far as I am advised.  The "female franchise" and "local option" has made the  present session of N. Z. Parliament very lively and caused  a quite a ripple on the political sea of the colony and  I might say of Australasia. The success of the former  measure is now in accomplished fact, and may be  regarded as a very radical departure for a British Colony.  Of course, it had bitter opponents among the conservative class

 Auckland New Zealand.  October 8th 1892.  Pres Wilford Woodruff and Counselors. Salt Lake City. Utah. U. S. A.  Dear Brethren:  I have pleasure in ac- knowledging your favor of Sept 12th. The Six Elders therein named had a very pleasant and speedy voyage arriving here in good health on the 6th.  I anticipate releasing Elders Milton Bennion and C. W. Taylor on Decr 25th to return to Zion and therefore will need  60.0.0 for their return fares, by return mail. The  180.0.0 mentioned in your last came Safely to hand.  We will need five ormore Elders by April and will probably be best to have them come on the "S S Monowai" which is expected to leave Sanfrancisco March 3rd 1893.  The latest accounts from the most of the district are quite encouraging and we regard the future prospects ^as being^ good.  Ever praying the blessings of God upon Zion and her inhabitants.

 only passing the upper House by a majority of 2. The local option Bill will succeed, but no doubt, but in such a form that but little good can expected from it.  Although this is a new country, "Strikes," "labour troubles" and "unemployed" are not strangers here. Money has exercised a far greater influence here in the settlement of this country, than, what we have known, especially, in the western part of America. Land monopoly, or the mopoly of the natural facilities, make it an easy matter for Capital to dictate its own terms, which means the enslavement of the masses. What a contrast between this and the ^Spirit,^ method, and ultimate results characterizing the settlement of the Saints in the once forbiding, but now, beatutiful and happy vales of Zion.  These is a strong feeling growing here in favor of the single tax system, so ably advocated by Henry George of America and looking to the naturalization of the land. The Gov't here are proceeding somewhat along those lines by a system of a grauated land tax. The law being adjusted so that the larger the holdings the greater their proportionate amount of tax.  Of course wise legislation may, to some extent, modify existing evils, but, only modify, for their final abolition, we must look to something that will tear from the heart of man the incubus of selfishness an[d] hate; immerse int in a solution that will dissolve its calloused surface which has been formed by ages of accumulated wrongs and oppressions; then, implant within it a love that is as broad as humanity, and as induring as eternity; inspire it with a knowledge of man's brotherhood and God's fatherhood,

 Auckland New Zealand September 89th 1892  President Wilford Woodruff. & Counsellors Salt Lake City  Dear Brethren;  It becomes my painful duty to report the death of our fellow laborer, Bro Otto Chipman ^of American Fork^ afterabout a weeks illness.  during which time he was attended by aElder T. C. Stanford, myself and Elders Madsen and hamblin was with him the last night.  He had been delirious for three days before death, yet he recognized and called each of us by name upon our arrival but soon after relapsed into his former condition being lost to surroundings.  He died on the 31st of August and will be shipped by the outgoing mail.  Elder Stanford and Hawkes will accompany his body home.  His death sickness is traceable to getting wet through a canoe capsizing.  Elder Chipman was making good progress in the language ^during his six months here^ and gave promise of becoming a very efficient missionary.  But it has been otherwise ordained.  The sympathy of the Elders for his wife and relatives, and sorrow at parting with a true friend has cast a gloom over all. Yet 
 while we sorrow we realize that our kind Heavenly Father doeth all things well, and we think it better to be called to labor on the other side of the vail when active and faithful here, than when in those conditions of indifference and worldly mindedness which many of the Saints have drifted into.  Bro Stanford will be able to give you all the particulars.  I have instructed him to telegraph you from Sanfrancisco and have you convey the sad inteligence to the bereaved family.  The expenses here have been quite heavy as you will see by the enclosed bill.  Bro Stanford takes  10.0.0 to pay Rail way charges on the other side, how much it will require I have no idea, but he will telegraph for more if he needs it.  He is also to let you know when he will be in Ogden so that relatives or others can meet him there.  I supupose the family will pay all the expenses above the usual return fare  Bro Hardy kindly came to my aid in money matters.  next month I expect return fares,  as per Bro Reynolds advice, for the two Elders going now the balance as per bill of  44.4.10 I will expect by return mail.  In March 1885 ^an^ Elder Hill was released from this mission by his own request on account of ill health  he clained he 
 had money to take him home so that nothing was  paid on his return fare.  I was then presiding here and subsequently learned that he borrowed  10.0.0 of one Brother Fryer with a promise to pay it in 3 months.  Elder Charles Heybourne of Cedar acquainted me with the case and has been doing all he could to have brother Hill pay it, but thus far without success.  I think that the amount ought to be paid with at least Five Pounds interest added.  And as nothing was paid on brother Hills return ^fare^ and as it seems he refuses to pay this sum and did not have the manhood to report it at the time and ask it to be paid ^then^ I now feel it my duty to report it to you knowing that you will take that course that will be proper under the circumstances. The amount of interest mentioned above is computed at 5 per cent the legal rate here.  Brother Fryer is still in the church but I am in- formed that this has been quite a trial to him.  Elder B. Hamblin. has had sore eyes Since April sometimes better some times worse. he  is now here in Auckland to ^have them^ be treated the dDoctor Says he will be able to cure them in 4 weeks.  Should he however not obtain relief, will release him to return I hope however this will not be necessary with this exceptions the Elders are all well or were at last accounts.  On my last visit to the 
 Southren districts a system of home missionary work was inaugerated, calling into active labor ^service^ an number of the Native's; recent reports from those district in relation to this labor is very gratifying.  I believe in the majority of the branches we can report an improvement whilst in some of ^the reverse^ is the case.  A long wet disagreeable winter is now drawing to a close and we are greatly in hopes that during the coming summer we will be able to accomplish considerable good and be able to make favorable reports.  With best regards I remain  Yours etc  W. T. Stewart  P. S. Three more Elders will be needed by the Boat leaving 'Frisco in December  W. T. S.  [Handwriting Changes] The money should be sent.  And I would suggest, a letter be written to bro Hill respecting the payment of that money he borrowed, and urging him to meet his obligation.  A few words sent to R. W. Heybourne, enquiring about Hill, and asking him to use his influ- ence, if he had any with, Hill would no doubt be a good thing.  J. F. S.

Prest. W. Woodruff & Councellors  Dear Brethren:  A Communi- cation from Bro. Geo. Reynolds reach ed ^me^ last evening, also the portion of Bro Fred. Stauffer's letter. I am glad the subject has come before you again, and I pray the Lord ^that^ all that He requires may be accomplished ^in^ the holy land.  I am strongly impressed with the idea that a competant elder ^or elders^ should be instructed ^by the presidincy^ and sent to Turkey to plant the germ, and it seems to ^me^  that the work of the elders ^in years past^ is about to culminate in a foot hold being obtained in Asia Minor to successfully platnt the gospel among the people.  Bros Musser and Herman are very intellegent men, but they need a more experienced man there to direct in these important matters.  Bro. Musser needs help. I do not know to ^how we can^ send him help from this mission, we are weak in numbers and especially in experienced men. Scarcely a man in the mission who has ever been in the missionary field before.  If Bro Empey & B. S. Young could do  something at or after Conference for to collect a fund for the Turkish mission it might be a good thing. I will guarantee one hundred dollars towards ten thousand, and this shall not interfere with the Temple fund for, as long as I have 
 the Turkish mission at heart as now I would stretch a point to favor it.  Can you provide long lists of names ^of missionaries^ for Apl. Conference, English, Welsh, Irish, scotch, Scandinavia, Germany, Switzerland Italy and the Turkish mission all need special attention. Germany and Scandinavia absolutely languish; while some of the choicest spirits on earth are receiving the gospel in England. True they are few, but the warning reaches them.  I have no confidence in my health. Sometimes without warning I feel like I would faint away, circu- lation very feeble, I fast, and that hurts me. I try to be care- ful in eating and drinking, but there is something wrong with my breathing aparatious when the air is muggy and cold ^I suffer^ I mention this to ^give^ a reason why I cannot get down to work as I would like to.  Have been in south of England where I feel much better.  I am patiently waiting for some one to take charge as your letter instructed me. I have done the best I could in selecting Bro. Solomon to be in Lpool while I am away ^You know his integrity is good while he is no scholar nor speaker in public.^  Wilby has had a few nervous attacks, but I believe he will be more careful to exercise in future. I have urged him to not remain in doors long at a time, get out on the  river, top of a bus, walk and ^get^ the purest air he can.

 Porirua, Wellington, N. Z. April 10th 1897.  Prest. Wilford Woodruff, Salt Lake City, Utah.  Dear Brother:  Your favor dated Jan. 30th and Feb. 27th came duly to hand, as also drafts to the value of $1,000. and $500. respectively. We are applying the money to liquidate indebtidness for past return fares, so as to stop interest, and for the return of Elders T. J. O'Brien, James C. Allen, Jens K. Nelson and T. S. Browning who were released at our Annual Conference on the 6th inst., to return home by May boat. The three will have spent three years and four months amongst the natives, and Elder Browning two years and six months amongst Europeans.  Notice of the death of Elder Edward Stevenson caused a degree of sensation and some sober reflection, but only to conclude, in the light of the Gospel, that our loss in his gain, and the condition far more to be envied than mourned. But for all that our feelings and sympathies go out for the family and relatives. O, how much more need we have for mourning the condition of some others of whom we hear, when we think of what already has and necessarily must befall

 Auckland, N. Z. Feb 11th 1897.  Prest. Wilford Woodruff Salt Lake City, Utah.  Dear Brother:  We are in receipt of letter dated Jany. 5th reporting five more Elders for this mission. They have undoubtedly arrived Sydney ere this. We can use them and also others.  Regarding the  197.0.0 to come next mail, oweing to the ill-health of Elder Moroni Lazenby it was deemed wise to release him to return home by the March boat. Elder C. H. Embley was also released to accompany him. The former has been here something over two and the latter some- thing over three years. I have arranged with Bro. Hardy to use  50.0.0 of the above amount for their return fares. And it is desired to release four more Elders at our April Conference in the Wairarapa which according to usual allotments would make in all  150.0.0 more, which we would be very pleased to receive not later than April.  It will be seen that our report is not made out as suggested by letter dated Jany. 4th Viz. giving births and deaths of males and females separately. And 'tis now too late to change or cor- 
 them except there should hapily be an immediate and radical change!  The epistle from yourself and colaborers to the Maori saints, was read to our Conference, and copier of same presented to Tamahan, Hoani Rangi Te Kaiwaho, Pu Rakaw and other outside leading male and female Rangatirai who were lending much to the support and success of our Conference, which brought forth much favorable comment. The remaining copies were given to Presidents of Conferences for distribution among the saints. It seemed almost to overjoy the grey-haired colored veterans, to see that you entertained not but words of counsel, good will and blessing for them, though they did not see as we do; and that so far as we were concerned, we wished to be at peace with, and have love and good will for all men, and gave efficacy to what I had told them, i. e. that you had not sent us out here as enemies of man or creed, but only to be enemies of all unrighteousness.  I announced to the Conference your ap- proval of the saints sending geneologies to Hirini Whoianga for him to be kept in the Temple work. I think it will be the means of inspiring them much in that direction.

 rect it and reach you for conference. The breth- eren inform me that this is according to Elder Jensen's late instructions. We will endeavour to follow out your suggestions in the future. I would like to ask if new baptized members are to also appear in column as members received?  Elder Almond Thomas Butterfield is out here without any Mission Certificate, or License to preach.  It was formerly the custom to sustain the general and mission authorities at our district as well as mission conferences; but has for some cause been discontinued. What would be your feelings and wishes in the matter?  I understand that the original Maori form or ceremony of marriage is for the parents or relatives on both sides to come together and mu- tually consent to the proposed or desired union; or, if between influential parties of different tribes, the chiefs of the respective tribes would mutually consent; and the parties begin living together as man and wife.  In some parts of the mission the bretheren are wholly ignoreing the Maori form of Marriage and disposeing of unions thus brought about as cases of adultery and fornication and making 
 We were a little disappointed to learn it would  be necessary to make shift, for the present, with  the help we have, no more missionaries having  been called for these parts; however we don t wish  to complain, but will be pleased to accept more  when you see proper to send them. In view of  this Elder Andrew Smith Jr. has been released  from the Presidency of the Tasmania Conference and  appointed to preside over the New South Wales  Conference which will locate him at Sydney, and  suburbs. He has had some 18 months experience  on the mission and is an able, energetic laborer,  and we think will fill that position with credit,  though it was with some degree of reluctance that  we moved him from his former field.  Two Elders should be released in July  next and seven in September. We would therefore  be pleased to receive means in time for the nec- essary remittances.  25. per head is the usual  allotment.  Since last writing we have held four  District Conferences on tour to the Wairarapa: per- formed nine baptisms, blessed perhaps as many  children, celebrated a number of marriages and  had a number of instances of healing, some of  which cases had, to all human appearances,

 reached the very jaws of death.  At our Annual Conference we had 28  Zion Elders present and about 500 saints and  friends. The new building was opened with  feast, ceremonies and dedication. Besides which  in the four days ten meetings in the native tongue,  for in neighboring European towns, and our  Elders meeting. The weather was good, and  the Lord indeed blessed us with a time of rejoic- ing, and we hope much good will grow out  of it all.  Besides your epistle we were favored  by one from our beloved brother and former Prest.  Wm Paxman and one from the Maori Association  which assisted materially in making our Con- ference as success. The outcome of all was the  location of the Conference there for the another year,  and permanent invitations to come and go at will.  In fact the leaders seem almost what we  would call "Dry land Mormons" and I suppose  held so on account of their position and desire  for continued popularity and influence.  I resume my travels through the mission  attending Conferences, going, in about ten days, to South Island.  We anxiously look forward to time of recieving 
 nan 
 them a matter of fellowship. I would be pleased to hear an expression from you as to wether or not the above is the proper course to pursue; or is the ceremony of the Maori nation in this res- pect entitled to the same respect and acknowl- edgement as that of other nations?  Making such unions a matter of fellowship may have grown out of the counsel of former Presidents to try and educate the Maori people up to a better ceremony in order to draw as broad a distinction as could be between marriage and living in adultry; as perhaps half of the European population are doing, in some of the cities at least.  Would it be improper for priest, teacher or deacon to perform the ceremony of marriage out here?  We have a case here where one of our sisters mar- ried a radical, narrow contracted roman cathlic european. She sayes she refused positively to give up her religion, and told him if he married her he would have to marry a "Mormon" which she was and would continue to be. He succeeded, however, in disgraceing her before marriage; and, seeming- ly would only be too pleased to have her excomuni- cated; but she earnestly pleads for secret baptism, as he wont consent to her being rebaptized, and promises, as far as is in her power, to tend her

She has been virtually suspended for nearly four years.  The europeans are enemies to this people spir- itually, temporally, physically and morally; and, seemingly, take delight in draging them down to death hell and destruction.  My policy has been as long as I could see something good in a person some honor or prin- cipal as a foundation to build upon or hopes of a  future outcome, to hold onto them, and perhaps I am too much that way. But often the case when we have decided that mercy ceases to be a vir- tue and put them on the outside, the Spirit of the Lord still continues to strive with them and they arent satisfied until they get back in.  I have just received of Bro. Thomas Finlayson, West Jordan, $25.50/100, per H B.

 held 5, 6, & 7th Insts. was a very interesting and in- structive one, and particularly noted for the gen- eral peace and quietude that prevailed in meetings and on the premises in general. Ten meetings were held in the three days with twenty-three Zion Elders in attendance, and between two and three hundred saints and friends. The Elders meet- ing held on the 8th continued six hours and a half; and was one long to be remembered by all in attendance. The time was spent in singing, praying, bearing testimony, asking and answer- ing questions and in giving general instruct- ions, all were melted down until there was- ent a dry eye in the room.  I expect to start south in a few days, holding district conferences down through and reach Wairarapa for annual conference of mission April 4th 5, & 6th  We are just now undertakeing to, locate Elders at Adelaide, South Australia, where we hope to get an opening and do a good work; as the people, as near as we have learned, are of a nature in their surroundings and occupations, that ought to take to the Gospel quite readily.  I am not aware that any thing has been  done as yet towards introduceing the Gospel 
 but he could not be persuaded to divulge it, until he became very low when to all appearance he was in the act of making a statment of some kind, when he was suddenly seized by an unseen power and strangled till it seemed as if he would not recover his breath. Since that time and to last accounts he has been irational.

Dear Brother:  Enclosed you will please find the slip that was desired to be filled out, giving numbers to January 1st 1897.

We are also in receipt of Bro. Reynolds'

With kindest regards to your self and co-laborers, your brother in the Gospel,  E. F. Richards.
