 Preisthood soon after the Aronic, and at the same place—before going to PeterWhitmers at Fayett senaca Cou NY—to continue the Translation of the Book of Mormon.Davids telling me that he was babtized in senaca Lake or River, in June ^1829^ and beingordained, and imediately after called to assist in the great work June, 1829 is good evidence to me......Now again, he stated to me soon after hewas ordained, he preached and Babtized and that thare were a number babtizedso that at the Organization of the Church, 6 Apr. the following year 1830 thare werein his Fathers House, a double log thouse of 2 rooms, about 40 mostly membersof the Church, But, only "6 Elders—" hence the so often repeated saying thatthe Church was organized with 6 members. I have beleived David, and ifmisled in this, I am open to conviction, and request to be corrected, for I have been in theChurch since 1833—58 years and wish to inculcate correct doctrines.David also related that while comeing from Harmony Pa,- about halfwayto Fayett, N.Y.- which was June 1829—they saw Maroni who at that timeappeared as an ordinary man and common attire with a knapsac on his back,he asked him to ride with them, but he replied I am only goind over to Cumorah,steped back and disappeared. Olliver and David asked the Prophet to enquire of the Lord whothis misterious and distinguised visitor was. David told me that when he lookedback at the Proptet he looked to him nearly transparent and said that was Maroniwith the plates, &c.- soon after their arrival at Fayett, David said his mothersaw Maroni and he also opened the plates turning them over leaf by leaf—but there was some portion sealed with 3 gold rings...... my visit wasvery much enjoyed and had a very good impression upon him. But not aswith Martin Harris, who I visited and brought to zion.  Now Bro WoodruffT. O—

 I candidly beleive that David had in someway committed himself, sothat the Lord did not wish him to come and receive his blessings in the House of the Lord. I have reasons to sustain this beleif—I have felt thus to express myself Thus on those subjects freely—The Brethren in Alberta are feeling well, and are much more united in their faith, without so much distinction and classification, as we have in our Babylonish Pride and Classifycation of S.L.C. and other older settlements, which proved a curse to both the Jaredites as well as the overthrow of the Nephites..... since I have been here by request I have given 6 public Lectures in Alberta on the subject of the early rise of the Church and the comeing forth of the Book of Mormon Illustrated by 3 paintings one of the Hill Cumorah 2nd Joseph the Prophet, and the Angle Maroni, delivering the precious Record and the 3rd one with the 7 lines of Characters coppied from the plates by the Prophets, and sent to Prophessor Anthon N.Y. by Martin Harris from the unusualy large Audiances, and the attraction and manifestations of the good Spirit [##Joseph Smith-History 1:59##]it wonderfully well remmunerates me for my expence and pains without otherCompensation for all of those Lectures are Freely given as freely received I have given about 150 of them free, now this in part answers the question asked by you, when I visited you recently at the Gardo House on the unplesant affair of Widdow Manwareing, What are you doing these Times? on the 1st day of May next. I shall- (thank God.) be 72 years of age, and have spent 58 years of that time in my Masters cause, and as a poor Widdows son, trying to save one soul-conquer and save Edward Stevenson, which if I succede I shall be sattisfied and well repaid for all the battles fought........ As to Sister Electa Manwareing my Daughterby my 3rd wife. I have often felt greived at the trouble you have been subjected to—and I think I have been very poorly repaid, for with my own hands building a house and making a presant of it and 10 acres of land to her, also of funishing her [ceal] andbread—and some money and other things, so that now I have concluded to turn the matter over to her Brotherinlaw and her brothers and placeing in their hands 50000 for them to pay the interest to her they all agree to aid her (and I hold myself ready to seeand do through them other help) So I think this may cut the thread which has subjected me to so much criticism by the 1st council of the Church. and I hope in the future save you so much trouble with the Widow. I believe I have done pretty well for one who last year paid 30000 cash tythingand Louie Stevenson 50000 cash dureing the last year I have also paid into defense fund 175.00/0008000 14th ward Church school &c. &c- Praying Gods choice blessings to be and abide with you I am your Brother in the covenant Edward Stevenson.

He has been in Utah a little over one year, and has been in the employ of bro J. W. Young during that time doing clerical work.

He has lived very economically batching it the moste of the time. and sleeping on a cot in the office where he is doing his work. He was willing to draw as little as possible so that when Bro Young would be able to pay his men in full he would a little sum of money coming to him to help him carry out he Educational Project. But circum-stances have seemingly turned against him.

 the language to some degree. As a missionary totravel around on foot I ^am^ not to be comited uponFrom 1881-1887 I have been suffering from a diseaseof the Knee joints which compelled me three years aftermy arrival in Utah (in 1884) to go back to my nativecountry to undergo a surgical operation. In that oper-ation the entire Knee joint was cut out, rendering myleft leg entirely stiff; of course this [an't] hinder mein the office work I am engaged in but I have neverbeen able to walk long distances; which is one of themost important factors for a missionary or travellingelder.When I married 2 years ago mywife was then divorced from her first husband, whoby some false step was cut off the church in 1885he had then 2 wifes and each one of them has 2 childrenby him. The house and lot on which they both lived belonged to my wife but since her husband left andas long as I am married this 2nd wife lived inour house and I have so to say cared for them all.Three months ago I offered her a certain amount for her share of the property although she hadreally not right to us according to the law of the land

Station, 1891                                                 Just now but he manifests a very humble spirit: has no disposition to find fault with anyone but is at a loss to know what to do. He has been a Protestan Clergyman and not a mechanic or an unskilled laborer. He has sacrificed all his worldly hopes for the gospel and he beleives he has made an excelent Bargain. He is now however passing through circumstances that are calculated to try character and so far as I can discover, he is enduring his trials with praise worthy submission and equani-mity of disposition. He is now helpless because he has no means to do anything with. He told ^me^ while talking matters over, that he would take a district shool, if he could get such a position, because he wanted to earn his own living and not draw upon the hospitality of his friends. Bro Young haswritten him an encouraging letter promising to help in his college [scheme]. In the mean time his surroundings wear a gloomy aspect He is struggling between poverty and hope and prays for a better day. It may be you can offer him some comforting counsel.Respectfully George Gwillym Bywaterm.m.

 OFFICE OFThe First Presidencyof theChurch of Jesus ChristofLatter-day Saints.[stamp in blue ink] RECEIVED,NOV 29 1897Answ'dSalt Lake City, Utah, Nov. 20, 1897.Dear Brethren:We have been pained quite frequently of late, when perusingthe reports of the Presidents of the various missions, to find so lowan average of ability and efficiency among the brethren who havelabored under them. This condition unfortunately is not confined toone missionary field, for the reports of all the Presidents make thesame showing. And further, the truthfulness of their representationsis emphasized by the fact that so many of the brethren return homewithout having fully filled an honorable mission. Indeed, occasionallysome of the elders have scarcely left before they are home again.These facts have led us to fear that in some cases brethrenhave been recommended for missions with the desire to get rid ofthem, or at best to do them good personally, or as the expression issometimes used "to save them." Now we do not object to men beingcalled who in earlier years may have done wrong, have been rough orwayward in their youth, if in later years they have lived a Godlylife and brought forth the fruits of repentance. But we do not wantmen of bad moral character, habitual users of tobacco, or those whoseconduct in any way would render them unworthy of this high callingrecommended for missions, under the impression or with the hope thatthey will repent and change their lives when they get in the mission-ary field. Let them repent of their sins at home and reform their

 lives here, and then perhaps they may be called as ambassadors forChrist to the nations of the earth. We desire it to be esteemed asa high honor to be thus called, as a stamp of the approval of theLord. Nor do we wish those selected to regard the call in thelight of a conscription that they must meet whether willing or not,as men are compelled to serve in the German or other armies of thecontinent of Europe.Henceforth a rule will be observed (though of course weourselves may occasionally depart therefrom) that no brother will becalled on a mission unless he is suggested, or if not suggested, en-dorsed by his Bishop and Stake President. These officers will beheld responsible for his standing in the church and worthiness at thetime he is called. Should a man be suggested by other officers ofthe church his name will be first submitted to the Bishops and Presi-dents--for the same examination and endorsement as though suggested originally by them.It would be much more satisfactory to us if every personwho is called to go on a mission could be examined before he iscalled by, at least, one of the Apostles, but this may not always bepracticable. In such a case it is highly important that his fit-ness, financial condition, &c., shall be ascertained by his Bishop andPresident of Stake, before anything definite is said to him on the subject; so that he may not be placed in the humiliating position ofbeing excused after being called, quite possibly for no fault forwhich he is himself responsible.

 Provo Utah March 26, 1891President Woodruff Salt Lake CityDear BrotherAs a last resort I bring my case before you hopeing youwill give it your kind consideration. On the 11th day of April1887 I left Gunnison Sanpete Co my place of residence to gointo Colorado to seek work at Gradeing it being myprofession the cause of my leaving home was on accountof being harrased continually By U. S. Marshalls. therefore inthe following spring of 1888, I had my Plural wife followedme, each of us returning in the winter of said year, mywife giving birth to child shortly after her arrivalin Salt Lake City hence the following trouble. I was arrested directlyafter my return over two years ago at Gunnison andwas tried while Judge Judd was in office and Convicted ^Sentenced^By Judge Blackburn to one year in the Penitentary Bro'sKing & Thurman of this place being my council determinedafter the sentence was passed that if I could get a half fairhearing it being an extra unusual case, it could be shownto be beyond their Jurisdiction therefore my councilworking with this object ^viz^ to get an other trial andhaving the evidence taken ^in writeing,^ as given by the witnesses that wasfirst offered the case could be easily won, as in the former 
 tives from the old country. I havesaved at present, or nearly so, formy fare to Europe, and what I cansave from now on until Aug. 12thwould go to my family for their sus-tenance while I am away. I have awife and three children, the oldestsoon 6 years. My wife and myself haveall the while been talking of the mat-ter, and figuring up our circumstances,and both are we as anxious that Ishould respond to the call for me togo. Estimating that I possibly couldleave the folks with from $300 to $350in cash and scrip, that would notlast them to pay house rent &c. untilI come home again, which I supposewill be at least two years' time. A fewdays ago I went to my Bishop, Bro.Isaac Barton of the 19th Ward, andhad a conversation with him in thisrespect, and stating to him these

 the children seems to be very unhealthyand it seems as though I am burdended down with care in this respect. I have nohelp to take care of and my things only what I do my self or can hire done I have no boy todo the least thing if I go away. I have triedto get a boy to stay with them but I cant getany one. I have no ^(relations)^ that are in a shape to take care of my family and place and have the parties to lookafter ^my^ family also. but they don't want to do that. and if I rent it seems as though they want the most of it for ^to^ look after it. Taking all my circumstancesinto consideration I don't see any way out to goon a mission without selling out my home andbuying a place in the Settlement. I am in debtabout three or four Hundred dollars, two hundredis in notes that are due in about a year the restI expect to settle this spring byybuy selling somecattle I have.

I do not sinceerelyand honestly believe that there ever was a people onearth from time immemorial to the pesent daythat has been so fully and completely misrepresentedby all who have taken a hand in the helish andunconstitutional methods adopted by the people andCongress, to drive from social distinction and robthem of their property, their virtue and above all theirsacred and undeniable right, under on the constitutionto excessive the most sacred right acorded anAmerican Citizen.
