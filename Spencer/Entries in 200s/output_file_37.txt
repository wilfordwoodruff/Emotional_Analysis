Wilford Woodruff,  Salt Lake City    Dear Bro:    Yours of the  9th inst came duely to hand, by  which I am informed, that  if no reasonable obstacle prevents,  that I will be required to  labour as a missionary in  New Zealand.    I realize this to be no small  undertaking, but my mind  has always been, if I were   called, I would go, if possible.  Now as the call is made, and you  request my feelings, I take this  opportunity to apprise you of my  willingness to accept, notwithstanding  I am without learning, and weak.

I am well, and feel well, and hope that those  choice blessings are enjoyed by you, and may continue with you unto the end.

I have no other property except one horse and a  cow, from which I have any income, not even a small piece  of ground to raise bred stuff on.    Now then Dear Bro Woodruff. I have something  far better than land or money. I have a good wife.  although she is not very strong, and two small children  who rely entirely upon my earnings for support.    Under these circumstances Bro. Woodruff, if you feel  that it would be best for me to take this mission  I think I will be willing to go and leave all in  the hands of the Lord.    I know it will be hard - very hard to leave my  family in such circumstances but I do not wish  to shirk my duty as a Later Day Saint.    Hoping to hear from you in relation to this  matter soon.

 Preisthood soon after the Aronic, and at the same place—before going to Peter  Whitmers at Fayett senaca Cou NY—to continue the Translation of the Book of Mormon.  Davids telling me that he was babtized in senaca Lake or River, in June ^1829^ and being  ordained, and imediately after called to assist in the great work June, 1829 is   good evidence to me......Now again, he stated to me soon after he  was ordained, he preached and Babtized and that thare were a number babtized  so that at the Organization of the Church, 6 Apr. the following year 1830 thare were  in his Fathers House, a double log thouse of 2 rooms, about 40 mostly members  of the Church, But, only "6 Elders—" hence the so often repeated saying that  the Church was organized with 6 members. I have beleived David, and if  misled in this, I am open to conviction, and request to be corrected, for I have been in the  Church since 1833—58 years and wish to inculcate correct doctrines.    David also related that while comeing from Harmony Pa,- about halfway  to Fayett, N.Y.- which was June 1829—they saw Maroni who at that time  appeared as an ordinary man and common attire with a knapsac on his back,  he asked him to ride with them, but he replied I am only goind over to Cumorah,  steped back and disappeared. Olliver and David asked the Prophet to enquire of the Lord who  this misterious and distinguised visitor was. David told me that when he looked  back at the Proptet he looked to him nearly transparent and said that was Maroni  with the plates, &c.- soon after their arrival at Fayett, David said his mother  saw Maroni and he also opened the plates turning them over leaf by leaf—  but there was some portion sealed with 3 gold rings...... my visit was  very much enjoyed and had a very good impression upon him. But not as  with Martin Harris, who I visited and brought to zion.  Now Bro Woodruff  T. O—

 Salt Lake City Nov 14th 1891    President Woodruff    Dear Brother    It has taken me a long time  to Reply to the call made upon me to fill a mission  to the Indian Territory And ask you to take Into  Consideration. One obstacle which I cannot Control  I sold a Piece of Property In the spring of this year  And the Party Utterly failed to Comply with the  agreement. This party haveing Improved my Property  on the Expence of others. It Jeopardized my Property  In such a way that It was necessary for me to Imploy  a Lawyer to defend myself. I Consulted my Atorney  In Regard to haveing my Case disposed of as soon as  Possible on account of the call made upon me.    He said it would be Imposible to have It come up  before the next Term of Court Or sometime  In Febuary. Therefor If you think It wise to Extend  the time untill my Property Is out of Jeopardy  I would gladly Respond. From your Brother In  the Gospel    Franklin N. Morris    the above Statment is Corereect   as far as I Can assertain    Alexander Garrick acting B.p.    I would give him till Apr. 92    J. F. S. 
 I candidly beleive that David had in someway committed himself, so  that the Lord did not wish him to come and receive his blessings   in the House of the Lord. I have reasons to sustain this beleif—  I have felt thus to express myself Thus on those subjects freely—    The Brethren in Alberta are feeling well, and are much more united   in their faith, without so much distinction and classification, as we have   in our Babylonish Pride and Classifycation of S.L.C. and other older settlements,   which proved a curse to both the Jaredites as well as the overthrow of the   Nephites..... since I have been here by request I have given 6 public   Lectures in Alberta on the subject of the early rise of the Church and the   comeing forth of the Book of Mormon Illustrated by 3 paintings one of the   Hill Cumorah 2nd Joseph the Prophet, and the Angle Maroni, delivering the precious   Record and the 3rd one with the 7 lines of Characters coppied from the plates by   the Prophets, and sent to Prophessor Anthon N.Y. by Martin Harris from the   unusualy large Audiances, and the attraction and manifestations of the good Spirit [##Joseph Smith-History 1:59##]  it wonderfully well remmunerates me for my expence and pains without other  Compensation for all of those Lectures are Freely given as freely received I have   given about 150 of them free, now this in part answers the question asked   by you, when I visited you recently at the Gardo House on the unplesant   affair of Widdow Manwareing, What are you doing these Times? on the 1st   day of May next. I shall- (thank God.) be 72 years of age, and have spent 58 years of   that time in my Masters cause, and as a poor Widdows son, trying to save one soul-  conquer and save Edward Stevenson, which if I succede I shall be sattisfied and well   repaid for all the battles fought........ As to Sister Electa Manwareing my Daughter  by my 3rd wife. I have often felt greived at the trouble you have been subjected to—  and I think I have been very poorly repaid, for with my own hands building a house   and making a presant of it and 10 acres of land to her, also of funishing her [ceal] and  bread—and some money and other things, so that now I have concluded to turn the   matter over to her Brotherinlaw and her brothers and placeing in their hands 50000   for them to pay the interest to her they all agree to aid her (and I hold myself ready to see  and do through them other help) So I think this may cut the thread which has   subjected me to so much criticism by the 1st council of the Church.   and I hope in the future save you so much trouble with the Widow.   I believe I have done pretty well for one who last year paid 30000 cash tything  and Louie Stevenson 50000 cash dureing the last year I have also paid into defense fund 175.00/000  8000 14th ward Church school &c. &c- Praying Gods choice blessings to be and   abide with you I am your Brother in the covenant Edward Stevenson.

I am called as I understand to labor in Scandanavia  which seems to me to be a mistake. I was born in  Switzerland and the German language is my  mother tongue, Swedish or Danish would therefore  be just as strange to me as any of the Indian languages.

He has been   in Utah a little over one year, and has been   in the employ of bro J. W. Young during that time   doing clerical work. As you are doubtless aware   Bro Young has not been able to pay his men   as he expected to have done. Bro Whitely is one   among others who has drawn but little pay. He   has lived very economically batching it the moste   of the time. and sleeping on a cot in the office   where he is doing his work. He was willing   to draw as little as possible so that when Bro Young   would be able to pay his men in full he would   a little sum of money coming to him to help him   carry out he Educational Project.

 the language to some degree. As a missionary to  travel around on foot I ^am^ not to be comited upon  From 1881-1887 I have been suffering from a disease  of the Knee joints which compelled me three years after  my arrival in Utah (in 1884) to go back to my native  country to undergo a surgical operation. In that oper-  ation the entire Knee joint was cut out, rendering my  left leg entirely stiff; of course this [an't] hinder me  in the office work I am engaged in but I have never  been able to walk long distances; which is one of the  most important factors for a missionary or travelling  elder.

Reynolds, Sec., but bearing   no address. This notice asks if it would be agreeable to   his feeling and consistent with his circumstances for him to  go on a mission early in 1892 to Europe. I have taken the   liberty of writing to you personally about him. He is just  starting in life, having been married only a few months.  He is manager and has full charge of the electric light  plant here, and was specially trained that he might take the  business in hand. We are just getting established, and if he  leaves, I am at a loss to know where his place could be  filled, unless by importing a stranger from the east or  west. As you are aware, it is not an ordinary business, and  takes special training to fit a person to assume charge.    Feeling assured that you will take no exception to  my intere^s^t in this matter and that you would be pleased to

Station, 1891                                                   Just now but he manifests a very humble   spirit: has no disposition to find fault with   anyone but is at a loss to know what to do.   He has been a Protestan Clergyman and not   a mechanic or an unskilled laborer. He has   sacrificed all his worldly hopes for the gospel   and he beleives he has made an excelent   Bargain. He is now however passing through   circumstances that are calculated to try character   and so far as I can discover, he is enduring his   trials with praise worthy submission and equani-  mity of disposition. He is now helpless because   he has no means to do anything with. He   told ^me^ while talking matters over, that he   would take a district shool, if he could get   such a position, because he wanted to earn   his own living and not draw upon the   hospitality of his friends. Bro Young has  written him an encouraging letter promising   to help in his college [scheme]. In the mean   time his surroundings wear a gloomy aspect   He is struggling between poverty and hope   and prays for a better day. It may be you   can offer him some comforting counsel.

I have been eleven  years in this county and have never been called be-  fore. I am prepared to go at any time as far as  my family is concerned.

I provided for my family, but have not  been able to get the money for my passage to Europe.  The response of the Elder Quorum and the two Paris Wards  was very poor, only fifty dollars was the result; which I   had to give to Bro. L. T. Shepherd, at the Tithing office, by  order of Prest.

 Brigham City, Utah  Jan. 15th, 1891    President Wilford Woodruff,  Dear Bro.    Your favor of 8th inst.,  regarding a mission to Great Britian, received  antd contents noted. In answer I will explain  my circumstances as near as possible. About  nine months ago I sold my home in Farmington  and moved to Brigham City, where I now reside.  My residence is only partially completed and it  has cost me more than I anticipated as labor  was very high here this summer. I am at  present involved financially and could not  get in condition next April. I would not feel  contented if my family was not provided with  a home and livelyhood while away.    Another obstacle is acaused on account of  the sudden demise of my father which took  place Oct 8th 1890, thus leaving me to look after  his Estate which is in a somewhat mixed  condition. My mother and the other heirs have  desired that I look after the financial

 OFFICE OF  The First Presidency  of the  Church of Jesus Christ  of  Latter-day Saints.    [stamp in blue ink]   RECEIVED,  NOV 29 1897  Answ'd    Salt Lake City, Utah, Nov. 20, 1897.    Dear Brethren:    We have been pained quite frequently of late, when perusing  the reports of the Presidents of the various missions, to find so low  an average of ability and efficiency among the brethren who have  labored under them. This condition unfortunately is not confined to  one missionary field, for the reports of all the Presidents make the  same showing. And further, the truthfulness of their representations  is emphasized by the fact that so many of the brethren return home  without having fully filled an honorable mission. Indeed, occasionally  some of the elders have scarcely left before they are home again.    These facts have led us to fear that in some cases brethren  have been recommended for missions with the desire to get rid of  them, or at best to do them good personally, or as the expression is  sometimes used "to save them." Now we do not object to men being  called who in earlier years may have done wrong, have been rough or  wayward in their youth, if in later years they have lived a Godly  life and brought forth the fruits of repentance. But we do not want  men of bad moral character, habitual users of tobacco, or those whose  conduct in any way would render them unworthy of this high calling  recommended for missions, under the impression or with the hope that  they will repent and change their lives when they get in the mission-  ary field. Let them repent of their sins at home and reform their

Salt Lake City, Utah, August 14th 1897    To your Majesties the  King and Queen of Sweden.    I have been informed that your Majesties  have been very kind to those of your Majesties' subjects  who have felt disposed to embrace the fulness of the ever-  lasting Gospel, popularly called Mormonism, some of  whom have emigrated to Utah.    These have united to prepare a small token of  respect to your Majesties, a box made of Utah Onyx,  containing the Book of Mormon, which will be presented  to you by one of their number Elder J. M. Sjodahl, and  which I hope and trust you will receive from them as  an evidence of the respect and love which they bear  toward your Majesties.    As a prophet, seer and revelator, and president of the  Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I bless you both  with all blessings which I have power to bestow upon my  fellow men, that in the morning of the resurrection you may  receive joy and rejoicing at the hands of the Creator, for the many  good deeds bestowed upon these your Majesties' subjects.

Nor do we wish those selected to regard the call in the  light of a conscription that they must meet whether willing or not,  as men are compelled to serve in the German or other armies of the  continent of Europe.    Henceforth a rule will be observed (though of course we  ourselves may occasionally depart therefrom) that no brother will be  called on a mission unless he is suggested, or if not suggested, en-  dorsed by his Bishop and Stake President. These officers will be  held responsible for his standing in the church and worthiness at the  time he is called. Should a man be suggested by other officers of  the church his name will be first submitted to the Bishops and Presi-  dents--for the same examination and endorsement as though suggested   originally by them.    It would be much more satisfactory to us if every person  who is called to go on a mission could be examined before he is  called by, at least, one of the Apostles, but this may not always be  practicable. In such a case it is highly important that his fit-  ness, financial condition, &c., shall be ascertained by his Bishop and  President of Stake, before anything definite is said to him on the   subject; so that he may not be placed in the humiliating position of  being excused after being called, quite possibly for no fault for  which he is himself responsible. It is very probable that from time  to time requisitions will be made by the Missionary Committee of the

 CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER DAY SAINTS  OFFICE OF THE CHURCH HISTORIAN  SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH  Feb. 27, 1934    This letter was written by President Wilford  Woodruff to accompany a jubilee gift to King Oscar   II and the Queen of Sweden, from Swedes and Nor-  wegians in Utah. I brought the letter to Stock-  holm, together with the gift referred to, a Book  of Mormon in Deluxe binding and deposited in a  box of Utah Onyx. But on my arrival in Stockholm  a letter from the First Presidency instructed me  to return this letter and instead, present one  signed by the President, Wilford Woodruff, and his  counselors. This was done. The letter from the  First Presidency was printed in full in the offi-  cial report of proceedings at the Jubilee.    Salt Lake City  Feb. 23, 1934.  J M Sjodahl  J. M. Sjodahl.

 Provo Utah March 26, 1891    President Woodruff Salt Lake City    Dear Brother    As a last resort I bring my case before you hopeing you  will give it your kind consideration. On the 11th day of April  1887 I left Gunnison Sanpete Co my place of residence to go  into Colorado to seek work at Gradeing it being my  profession the cause of my leaving home was on account  of being harrased continually By U. S. Marshalls. therefore in  the following spring of 1888, I had my Plural wife followed  me, each of us returning in the winter of said year, my  wife giving birth to child shortly after her arrival  in Salt Lake City hence the following trouble. I was arrested directly  after my return over two years ago at Gunnison and  was tried while Judge Judd was in office and Convicted ^Sentenced^  By Judge Blackburn to one year in the Penitentary Bro's  King & Thurman of this place being my council determined  after the sentence was passed that if I could get a half fair  hearing it being an extra unusual case, it could be shown  to be beyond their Jurisdiction therefore my council  working with this object ^viz^ to get an other trial and  having the evidence taken ^in writeing,^ as given by the witnesses that was  first offered the case could be easily won, as in the former 
 tives from the old country. I have  saved at present, or nearly so, for  my fare to Europe, and what I can  save from now on until Aug. 12th  would go to my family for their sus-  tenance while I am away. I have a  wife and three children, the oldest  soon 6 years. My wife and myself have  all the while been talking of the mat-  ter, and figuring up our circumstances,  and both are we as anxious that I  should respond to the call for me to  go. Estimating that I possibly could  leave the folks with from $300 to $350  in cash and scrip, that would not  last them to pay house rent &c. until  I come home again, which I suppose  will be at least two years' time. A few  days ago I went to my Bishop, Bro.  Isaac Barton of the 19th Ward, and  had a conversation with him in this  respect, and stating to him these

 the children seems to be very unhealthy  and it seems as though I am burdended   down with care in this respect. I have no  help to take care of and my things only what I   do my self or can hire done I have no boy to  do the least thing if I go away. I have tried  to get a boy to stay with them but I cant get  any one. I have no ^(relations)^ that are in a shape to take   care of my family and place and have the parties to look  after ^my^ family also. but they don't want to do that.   and if I rent it seems as though they want the most   of it for ^to^ look after it. Taking all my circumstances  into consideration I don't see any way out to go  on a mission without selling out my home and  buying a place in the Settlement. I am in debt  about three or four Hundred dollars, two hundred  is in notes that are due in about a year the rest  I expect to settle this spring byybuy selling some  cattle I have. I have no money on hand at  all. In fact never seen money so scarce up here  before. I will here state that I would not  of been in debt so bad. But I bought a piece of

Though not answering me directly, he  gave me some good advices and coun-  selled me to state my circumstances to  you, which I have here done.    Now, Brother Woodruff, I am, as  said before, axnxious to go, and wished  my finances were such that I could now  answer thus: I am willing and ready to go.  I have not faith in the Lord, perhaps,  enough to leave myself, my family, and  everything else in His hands, when com-  pared with the sacrifices yourself and other  servants of the Lord have endured. My  office of duty is, or ought to be, to be  ready at any moment when required to  go. Do not construe my statements as an  excuse on my part from not going. 
 have a record in the supreme court of this   state, and also a record as a good speaker of  more than is usualy acurded to public speakers.  I am well satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt,  that my labors would be crowned with sucess,  both to the advantage of the Church in an increase  of membership: and the changing of a false public  opinon in regarding your people. I do not sinceerely  and honestly believe that there ever was a people on  earth from time immemorial to the pesent day  that has been so fully and completely misrepresented  by all who have taken a hand in the helish and  unconstitutional methods adopted by the people and  Congress, to drive from social distinction and rob  them of their property, their virtue and above all their  sacred and undeniable right, under on the constitution  to excessive the most sacred right acorded an  American Citizen. (the right to cast his balott,)  with out which a peoples government is a sham,  a fraud: and a falure, as has been the heroic  and heroism heroism people commonly called  Mormons, but whose true name is or at least  ought to be The Church and only Church of virtue  and honesty, virtueous be cause they live it;  honest because they deal it out to all,  what Church can truthfully boast of one half  of what the mormon people can in the way  of social and financial distinction as well  as religious. none as I will be able to prove and  fully satisfy the most credulous and prejudiced  if you but only have the patience to listen as I know  you all have.

Wilford Woodruff    Dear Bro:    I recd a notice from  you of my name being handed  in & accepted as a mission-  ary to the Northern States,  but as I had talked with  Bro. Geo. Reynolds & acquain-  ted him of my circumstances  generally just before Christmas  last & that he gave me to  understand that it would  be allright for me to get  ready to go on my mission  by the coming Fall, I have  since been working to that  end. I accept of the call &

 land last fall and had to pay three Hundred  dollars for it and that has left me in the condition  that I am. I do not offer these as excuses for   not going on a mission But these are plain fact   an truths, and were I in a shape to go I would  of never written to you about them, but would  of been on hand at the specified time. I have  other reasons but these are the main ones. I will here   state that I am not idle to home, I labor with  sabbath school, and young men mutual to the   best of my ability, and also as a teacher in the  ward and in living where I do it requires a grat  deal of Faith, be that as it may I try to do my   duty and strive to be Obedient to those who  are placed over me. I would like you to take   my situation into consideration, And at your   earliest convenience give me your Kind and  ^Brotherly^ Council in the matter. And in your best  Judgemet you could release me, it would be  greatly apreciated. From your Brother in  the Gospel Isaac Price.

 been spent in this matter. I possiably may go to the   Pen on the 28 of this month as I cannott move any further  in the case for want of means. Brother Woodruff I crave  your goofd offices in relation to my family    my Plural wife is at Milford Utah and my other family  is at Gunnison Utah I hope you will understand  that had I my freedom and with the blessings of God  upon me I could pull through as my faith in  the principles of the Gosple are such that it is the  Kingdom of God with me or nothing    by kind permission I would refer you to Prest Lyman  as He knows me and some of the circumstances conected    Your Brother in the Gosple of Christ  J B Wasden    the adress of the Family at Gunnison  Nancy A Wasden    Caroline Wasden Milford Utah this lady  being the Plural wife    I shall be at Provo a few days as all hinges on the return of  the Prosecuting Attory Evans being expected here in a few days 
 I wish to go; and if Brother Wood-  ruff says for me to make ready and  go on August 12th, then I shall gladly  prepare knowing that the Lord will  add His blessings whatever our circum-  stances may be.    Your humble Brother in the  Gospel of Christ,  Hugo Peterson    (Deseret News Office.)    The idea I wished to convey to Bro Peterson. Was,  If he would go in faith, trusting in the Lord he  would be blest. And while his family might  not get the comforts of life, the same as if he  was with them, they would not suffer for the  necessities. And he could state his circumstances  in his answer.    I believe Bro Peterson will perform a good  mission, and can cheerfully Endorse his name  Isaac Barton  Bp 19th ward    My impression is that if bro.  Peterson will work to the point  of going as requested, the way  will open, and he will feel all  right about going. We must trust in Gods providence in many things. J.F.S.
