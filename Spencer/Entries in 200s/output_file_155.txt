 engaged in the State movement, and whatever you pay out to newspapers or in other quarters which have a direct bearing and are connected with the State move-ment, should be charged to the "Fund." Whatever may be necesssary to expend in conducting the ordinary busi-ness such as has been heretofore done at sessions of Congress, should be placed in the accounts they were formerly charged to.The suggestions concerning the Elders of the Southern States were submitted to the Council and they seemed to feel reluctant about withdrawing them from the field entirely; but it was suggested that aletter be written to the President of the Southern States Mission, asking him to make his arrangements so that they would avoid laboring in places where hostility was excited or where unfavorable comments would be made by the press. I had, however, some little time ago, suggested to Elder Wm Spry, (who presides now over the Southern States Mission) this same line of 
 policy and called his attention to the position that we were occupying at the present time in endeavoringto get a State government, and how necessary it was that we should not create any more excitement in the South than possible, as some of our friends in Congress complained that their constituents wrote to them uponthe subject. This letter, when read to the Council, ap-peared to be quite satisfactory to them. I have since received a letter from Bro. Spry, in reply to mineupon this subject, in which he acquiesces and in-timates that he will carry out the policy suggested.^Attorneys Mal x^ It is with great regret that we hear about the differences of views among our attorneys in regard to the proper method of conducting the Church suit. These differences weaken us very much and make us feel that our property is in great jeopardy. (Maudewrote and telegraphed to us concerning an appeal. He has appeared very anxious to have some plan sent to him which he could bring through influential 
 friends before the Attorney General, so that the way might be paved for carrying the case to the Supreme Court and stopping the ixamination here. The telegrams which we sent you contained this plan. We had Le Grand Young, Sheeks & Rawlins and Judge Sutherland meet with us and the dispatch that was sent you was framed by them. They did not seem very clear in their views about it; but Maude was so urgent to hear from us that it seemed too bad that we could not decide upon some way of getting this matter put in shape that would bring it before the U.S. Supreme Court for decision upon the constitutionality of the law. He wrote to us and gave us the names of influential parties that could be got to bring this matter before Garland. We urged this upon our attorneys here several times, but with no particular result until the night when we sent you the dispatch, when we insisted on something being given to us.) Of course, you will see before this reaches you that Bro. M. M. Sheets has been 
 sent to the penitentiary. They hope, by means of this case, through the merit of habeas corpus being broughtbefore the U. S. Supreme Court, that the vital pointswhich we wish to have decided can be reached. You inform us, however, in your recent letter that our attor-neys there have doubts even upon this point. Thisseems to surprise Bro. LeGrand Young; for he asserts that Col. Broadhead has written to him, asking whythe habeas corpus case has not been obtained. We aredoing the very best we can here, under the circumstances; but the probabilities are, from present appearances, that unless there should be something done to stop the operations, this investigation will take a very widerange and every transaction of the Church will be pryed into and, if possible, unsettled.We telegraphed you in regard to Pad-dock. You said that you did not know how to reach him. The U.P. people, doubtless, can check him, if anyone can, as they, no doubt, contributed to his 
 election and without their aid he would ^not^ have been where he is. Mr. Sidney Dillon has always mani- fested a kind feeling, and perhaps Messrs. Shellaberger& Wilson, who are in the employ of the U.P. people, might be able to furnish you some aid in getting this matter before Mr. Dillon or the U.P. people.We deserve some aid at their hands, and if they are appealed to properly they ought to render it.We hope you will be able to get along with the Woman's International Council without having any tirade against us. Your proposal to aid them is a good one and we hope you will be able to carry it out and to check any such ebullition as is threatened.We entirely approve of the price that you have offered Bro. John W. Young $25000 per month for your board and lodgings for the four months ending April 1st. We would like to see him satisfied and hope that anything you can do 
 to comply with his wishes, if they are not intirely too unreasonable, will be done by you.We join in love to you, and the brethren of the Council send their love. We constantly remem-ber you and uphold you in our faith and prayers, and trust you will be kept from the hands of all your enemies and be very successful in performing every duty that devolves upon you.We areYour Brethren, Wilford WoodruffGeo.

 G. S. L. City Feby. 4 1857Editor of the MormonDear Sir,We have not received any Eastern mail for the last 3 months Mr. Gerrish arrived from the Plains on the 19 th. Ulto, reports a mail somewhere on the way. We have received the California Mail regularly up to this time, by which we occasionally hear something from the lower world.The Jan. mail for the East was sent out, but only got to the topof the little mountain, before it was stopped by the vast quantity of snow,and one carrier froze to death, the remainder returned. We are passing throughthe most severe winter so far as snow is concerned that we have ever ex-perienced in these vallies, the mountains are full, and over 8 feet hasfallen in this city acording to Judge Phelps' report, it has lain for a month between 2 & 3 feet deep in our streets, and about 3 feet on the islands& more North. All the stock have been brought from the Island, andsome from the North, and were fed in the city, some driven South, andsome to Rush valley, notwithstanding the great amount of snow there hasbeen but few of the stock lost in comparison to the loss last winter. Theabundance of Snow in the mountains will be of great benefit for irri-gation the coming season, the Earth needs it as it has been very dry fo[r]two years. The wheat which was sown in the dry dust last Fallhas sprouted under the snow, and grown several inches, we have had aconstant thaw for about one week past, which causes the water to graduallysoak into the soil. The inhabitants of this city have again commenced laborupon the cotton wood canal, to bring that stream to this city, and theyexpect to finish it by the opening of Spring. the inhabitants of DavisCounty have also commenced on a Canal to take out a portion of theWeber river into Davis County for irrigation, mills &c. 
 We would like to have some of our Eastern friends forward us a fewof the tubers of the chinese Potatoe as advertized by Wm. R. Prince Hoy.as we would like to make a trial of it in this Territory, we wouldalso wish our friends who are emigrating to this Territory to still bearin mind, the propriety of  bringing with them or forwarding as theymay have opportunity anychoice fruit seeds, cuttings, roots &c. that will bea benefit to the Territory. We would like to obtain some of Hoveys seedlingstrawberries or any other good kinds & Lawton's blackberry, Catawba & Isabella Grapes,Indigo or madder or cotten seeds, and seed from the chinese sugar cane orMillet. Hon. J. M. Bernhisel has blessed us from time to time with seedsand grain from the Patent office, some of which I think will prove quite abenefit to us for which we feel to return him our thanks.The Reformation is progessing throughout this city and Territory withgreat interest. President Young has given much valuable information andteaching to the Quorums and people, although he has not been able to attendthe meeting at the Tabernacle since the burial of President J. M. Grant onthe 4th. Decem. Ulto. until last Sunday the 1st inst. He with hiscounsellors H. C. Kimball & D. H Wells all appeared in the stand, the Tabernaclewas crowded to overflowing as has been the case nearly all Winter andhundreds have to l[e]ave who cannot get into the house. the appearanceof Prest. Young in the Tabernacle after an absence of two months createda sensation throughout the vast assembly, he addressed the people for aboutone hour and a half, his discourse was very interesting and edifying to thepeople, he was clothed with the spirit and power of God and the heartsof the people were open to receive his words which were quick & powerful.He was followed by Presidents Kimball and Wells, all of the discourses willappear in the News. President Kimball has spoken to the people forseveral Sabbaths previous upon several subjects in great plainness presenting 
 the parable of the vineyard, the vine &c., to illustrate his ideas, histeachings have been of much benefit to the Saints. The Twelve whowere here, have gone forward with the missionaries through every wardin the city, teaching the Elders and the people, meeting with the variousQuorums of the church, we have attended a meeting of some kind al-most every evening for three months. The people are rising up en masseand trying to live their religion, by confessing and forsaking their sins, and preparing for the waters of Baptism, the spirit and power ofGod is manifest in Zion. The word of the Lord through hisservants who are clothed with the power of God and the fire of theHoly Ghost causes the sinner to tremble and fearfulness to surprize thehypocrite, and the people universally feel like putting away sin andiniquity of every kind. all places of worship both in the city and countryare crowded to excess. The people are beginning more to feel the importanceof living their religion magnifying their calling and building up thekingdom of God. Their has been four of the quorum of the Twelve inthis city during the sitting of the Legislature viz. O Hyde, L. Snow,F. D. Richards & myself. Elder Hyde has now gone South on amission through the city and brother Snow is mostly confined to BoxElder. Elder Richards & myself remain in this city at present.we expect Elders A. Lyman & C. C. Rich will be with us thisSpring.yours truly,W. Woodruff 
 Bro. Taylor. I have named in my letter that I wished toget the chinese Potatoe. I have written to J. M. Bernhisel tosee something about it but not knowing that he will be ableto do it, I wish you would send to Wm. R. Prince $5.00and direct him to put up that amount, and send it toW. Woodruff, Great Salt Lake city U T & I will paythe money here in any way that you will order.W. W 
 TO THE SAINTS:To the officers and members of theChurch of Jesus Christ of Latter- day Saints, in General Conferenceassembled:Dear Brethren  and Sisters  EveryLatter-day Saint will recognize thevalue of union, not only in action butin the matters of faith and discipline. As to the rights and authority of thePriesthood of the Son of God, it is ofthe highest importance of opinionamong the officers and members of theChurch of  Jesus Chr[i]st of Latter-day Saints. Feeling the necessity if a cor-rect understanding of this prin-ciple, we deem it proper at this sixty-sixth anniversary of the organization of the Church in theselast days, to prepare and present state-ment on the subject, embodying the doctrine which has always prevailedin the Church, and our views upon it.We are prompted to adopt this courseat the present time because of eventswhich have happened during the latepolitical contest. A great diversity of opinion on the subject has been ex-pressed, and even by leading Elders inthe Church, which latter fact hasnaturally led in some instances to considerable division of sentiment.It is of great importance that we un-derstand each other and that there be harmony in our teachings. It is espec-ially important that these teachingsshall be in accordance with the rulesand regulations and doctrines whichhave been taught and which have pre-vailed from the beginning until thepresent time, having not only thesanction of undisputed usage, but the approval of all faithful leaders in theChurch and of Him in whose nameand by whose authority they act.In the late exciting contest, to whichreference has been made, the presidingauthorities in some instances have beenmisunderstood. In other instances they have been misrepresented,which has led to a wrongfulconception of their real views.It has been asserted too freely,and without foundation, that there hasbeen a disposition on their part to in-terfere with individual liberty and to rebuke in some men a course which was applauded in others. In a word,that they have appeared to desire toassert and maintain an unjust and op-pressive control over the actions of the members of the Church, and in thusdoing have endeavored to effect aUnion of Church and State. In theheat of political discussion,  asser-tions have been made and ar-guments used conveying to the pub-[l]ic mind a false idea concerning 
 the position of the officers of theChurch, and leaving the impres-sion that there has been and wasnow being made an attempt to ac-complish the union above referred to.Now that the excitement has passed,and calmer reason has resumed itssway, we think it prudent to set forth,so that all may understand, the exactposition occupied by the leading au-thorities of the Church.In the first place we wish to state inthe most positive and emphatic lan-guage that at no time has there everbeen any attempt or even desire on thepart of the leading authorities referredto to have the Church in any mannerencroach upon the rights of the State, or to unite in any degree the functionsof the one with those of the other.Peculiar circumstances have sur-rounded the people of Utah. For manyyears a majority of them in every por-tion of the Territory belonged to oneChurch, every reputable memberof which was entitled to hold and[old] some ecclesiastical office. Itis easy to see how, to the casual ob-server, it might appear singular thatso many officers of the Church werealso officers of the State; but whilethis was in fact the case, the distinc-tion between the Church and the Statethroughout those years was carefullymaintained. The President of the Church held for eight years the high-est civil office in the community,having been appointed by the nationaladministration governor of the Ter-ritory. The first secretary of the Terr-tory was a prominent Church official.An Apostle represented the Territoryin Congress as a delegate during tenyears. The members of the Legisla-ture held also offices in the Church.This was unavoidable; for the mostsuitable men were elected by the votes of the people, and, as we have stated,every reputable man in the entire com-munity held some Church position,the most energetic and capable hold-ing leading positions. This is allnatural and plain enough to those who consider the cir-cumstances; but it furnished oppor-tunity for those who were disposed to assail the people of the Territory tocharge them with attempting to uniteChurch and State. A fair investigationof the conditions will abundantly dis-prove the charge and show its utterfalsity.On behalf of the Church of which weare leading officers, we desire again tostate to the members and also to thepublic generally, that there has notbeen, not is there, the remotest desireon our part or on the part of our co-religionists to do anything looking to aunion of Church and State.We declare that there has never beenany attempt to curtail individualliberty   the personal liberty of any ofthe officers or members of the Church.The First Presidency and other lead-ing officers did make certain sugges-tions to the people when the division on party lines took place. That move-ment was an entirely new departure,and it was necessary, in order that thefull benefit should not be lostwhich was hoped to result fromthis new political division,that people who were inexperi-enced should be warned against hastyand ill-considered action. In somecases they were counseled to be wiseand prudent in the political stepsthey were about to take, and this withno idea of winning them against theirwill to either side. To this extent, and no further, was anything said or doneupon this question, and at no time andunder no circumstances was any attemptmade to say to voters how they shouldcast their ballots. Any charge thathas been made to the contrary is ut-terly false.Concerning officers of the Churchthemselves, the feeling was generallyexpressed in the beginning of the po-litical division spoken of that it wouldbe prudent for leading men not to ac-cept of office at the hands of the po-litical party to which they might be-long. This counsel was given to menof both parties alike   not because itwas thought that there was any impro-priety in religious men holding civiloffice, not to deprive them of any ofthe rights of citizenship, but becauseof the feeling that it would be betterunder all the circumstances which hadnow arisen to avoid any action thatwould be likely to create jealousy and ill-feeling. An era of peace andgood-will seemed to be dawning uponthe people, and it was deemed good toshun everything that could have the least tendency to prevent the con-summation of this happy pros-pect. In many instances, how-ever, the pressure brought tobear upon efficient and popular menby the members of the parties to whichthey belonged was of such a characterthat they had to yield to the solicitationto accept nomination to office, or sub-ject themselves to the suspicion of badfaith in their party affiliations. Insome cases they did this without con-sulting the authorities of the Church;but where important positions wereheld, and where the duties were of aresponsible and exacting character,some did seek the counsel and ad-vice of the leading Church authoritiesbefore accepting the political honorstendered them. Because some othersdid not seek this counsel and advice,ill-feeling was engendered, and undueand painful sensitiveness was stimu-lated; misunderstanding readily fol-lowed and as a result the authoritiesof the Church were accused of badfaith and made the subjects of bitterreproach. We have maintained thatin the case of men who hold highpositions in the Church, whose dutiesare well defined, and whose ec-clesiastical labors are understoodto be continuous and necessary,it would be an improper thing to ac-cept political office or enter into anyvocation that would distract or removethem from the religious duties restingupon them, without first consultingand obtainig the approval of their associates and those who preside overthem. It has been understood fromthe very beginning of the Church thatno officer whose duties are of the character referred to, has the right to engage in any pursuit, political orotherwise, that will divide his time and remove his attention from the callingalready accepted. It has been theconstant practice with officers of theChurch to consult or, to use our lan-guage, to "counsel" with  their breth-ren concerning all questions of thiskind. They have not felt that theywere sacrificing their manhood in do-ing so, nor that they were submittingto improper dictation, nor that in so-liciting and acting upon the adviceof those over them, theywere in any manner doingaway with their individual rights andagency, nor that to any improper de-gree were their rights and duties asAmerican citizens being abridged or interfered with. They realized thatin accepting ecclesiastical office theyassumed certain obligations; thatamong these was the obligation tomagnify the office which they held, toattend to the duties in preference to every other labor, and to devote them-selves exclusively to it with all thezeal, industry and strength theypossessed, unless released inpart or for a time by thosewho preside over them. Our view, andit has been the view of all our prede-cessors, is that no officer of our Church, especially those in high standing,should take a course to violate this long-established practice. Rather thandisobey it, and declare himself by hisactions defiantly independent of hisassociates and his file leaders, it hasalways been held that it would bebetter for a man to resign the duties ofhis Priesthood: and we entertain thesame view today.In view of all the occurrences to whichreference has been made, and to thediversity of views that have arisenamong the people in consequence, we 
 feel it to be our duty to clearly defineour position, so there may be no causehereafter for dispute or controversyupon the subject.First We unanimously agree to andpromulgate as a rule that should al-ways be observed in the Churchand by every leading officialthereof, that before accepting anyposition, political or otherwise,which would interfere with the properand complete discharge of his ecclesi-astical duties, and before accepting anomination or entering into engage-ments to perform new duties, saidofficial should apply to the proper au-thorities and learn from them whetherbe can, consistently with the obliga-tions already entered into with theChurch upon assuming his office, takeupon himself the added duties andlabors and responsibilities of the newposition. To maintain proper disciplineand order in the Church, we deemthis absolutely necessary; and in as-serting this rule, we do not considerthat we are infringing in the least de-gree upon the individual rights of thecitizen. Our position is that a manhaving accepted the honors and oblige-tions of ecclesiastical office in theChurch cannot properly of his ownvolition make those honors subordi-nate to or even co-ordinate which newones of  an entirely different character;we hold that unless he is willing tocounsel with and obtain the con-sent of his fellow-laborers and presid-ing officers in the Priesthood, heshould be released from all obligationsassociated with the latter, before ac-cepting any new position.Second We declare that in makingthese requirements of ourselves andour brethren in the ministry, we donot in the least desire to dictate tothem concerning, or to interfere withthe affairs of the State; neither do weconsider that in the remotestdegree we are seeking theunion of Church and State. Weonce more here repudiate the insinua-tion that there is or ever has been anattempt by our leading men to trespassupon the ground occupied by the State,or that there has been or is the wishcurtail in any manner any of its func-tions.Your brethren,WILFORD WOODRUFF,GEO.

 ELDERS JOURNALVinalhaven, Fox Islands, Me.March 9th, 1838.BISHOP EDWARD PARTRIDGE, and PRESI-DENTS JOSEPH SMITH JR., SIDNEY RIGDON,HYRUM SMITH, and THE SAINTS IN ZION,GREETING:Dear friends in the new and everlastingcovenant;I, Willford Woodruff, sit down to inform you, that I have just heard, correctly, of the deplorable state of things in Kirtland, and I have this day held a council with Elders J. Ball and J. Townsend, who are now with me upon these Islands, and we resolved to address a few lines to you concern-ing our feelings, and set before you a brief account of things with us, and the course we intend to pursue. I have labored principally alone upon these Islands, since Elder Hale left last fall, and the work of the Lord has prosper-ed in my hands, or in other words, the Lord has worked with me during the winter. Elder Joseph Ball has been with me for a number of weeks past upon the Islands. There is rising of 40 members in the church on these Isl-ands, and they are strong in the faith. I returned last evening from a mission in company with Elder James Town-send. we have been visiting the most notable cities and vilages in the eastern country, and delivering unto them the word of God.We preached in their City Halls, Chapels, School houses, dwellings &c., in such places as Camden, Belfast, Northport, Frankfort, Hampden and the City of Bangor. Doors were open in all of these places, and many others I might mention, and the people heard with profound attention; and many are believing. I never saw more doors open for doing good, than at the pres-ent time in the State of Maine: But the Devil is stired up against me here on the Island.One Methodist priest has applied several times for a warrant to take me, but the Officers, as yet, will not grant him any, for he cannot bring any ac-cusation against me in truth or justice.The most trouble I now have, is the stopping the papers. I have forwarded about 30 subscribers with the money, and now the press is burnt down, and our enemies roar in the midst of the congregations, and they set up these ensigns for signs.I expect the report of these things will come like a clap of thunder in the ears of the Saints upon these Islands and else where. They do not know it yet, but are wondering why these pa-pers do not come. We have appointed a time to meet the church, and we shall lay all these things before them and trust in God for wisdom to direct us. The Elders that are with me are expecting to go to their homes, and I shall be left to fight the battles alone. Brethren, pray for me out of Zion, for I have a load to bear; but in the name of Elijah's God, I am determined to stand at my post. I feel as though the time of Jacob's trouble had began, but I know God will deliver him out of it, and fulfil his word.We are advising the Saints of God to go from this country to Zion, as soon as they can. I suppose this is right: many are preparing to go the following season.Now we say to the Presidency of the church in Zion; we do not expect to counsel you, nor any one there, let God be your counselors. But we ask, can it not be consistent with the will of God and your feelings and circum-stances, to soon publish the Elders'Journal from Zion, that we may have one weapon, to cut away some of the deep gloom, that will be cast upon the minds of thousands of the Saints, by wicked men and devils, and false breth-ren. The traveling Elders feel the wait of these things, equally, if not more than those who are in Zion; for we are naked targets to the press and tongue, as we pass through the midst of the Gentiles. O my God! have mercy and support us, I pray, through the toils that are to come, that our gar-ments may be washed white in the blood of the Lamb! for it is through tribulation that we inherit the blessing and overcome.Could the Elders' Journal be contin-ued, it would be great relief to the feel-ings of all the faithful; for while our enemies are publishing against us, even in Kirtland, we should also know what God is doing for his Saints.Brethren, we pray you to consider this last clause, not for our sake alone, but for the sake of all the faithful that are scattered abroad. We do not make these remarks because we have any lack of confidence in you No. God forbid, we believe you have done, and will do all that lies in your power for 
 ELDERS JOURNALthe salvation of Israel; and for one, I pray God to take away my life, sooner than to suffer me to turn my back upon the faithful part of the church of Latter Day Saints, and Joseph whom God hath chosen to lead his people. O my soul mourns over the corruptions of the hearts of men! O how man will stum-ble in dark places, when he neglects prayer and departs from his God! O ye Saints of Zion, watch and pray, and keep the Celestial law, which is safe!That you may know the feelings of the undersigners of this page, we say to you before God, that we are in full fellowship with Joseph Smith jr. and the first Presidency of the church, and with all who still adhere to, and receive their teachings and instructions; and we say, in the name of Jesus Christ, that we will uphold such by our pray-ers, faith, and influence, at the risk of our fortunes, lives, and worldly honor. "For life is but a name, when virtue and truth is gone."We further believe, that judgment awaits the world speedily, Kirtland not excepted, and we do believe that those who have dissented from the body of the church, will have cause to lament for their folly. We ask in the name of reason and revelation, who has power to take from Joseph, the keys delivered to him by the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and deprive him of the work that God has said he should per-form? We answer, none but God alone. We believe the book of Mor-mon and Doctrine and Covenants, speaks too loud upon the subject, to fall unfulfilled and to be made void, by those who have neglected prayer, and departed from the living God, and sought to take honor unto themselves.  O ye Saints of God in Zion! we en-treat you to uphold Joseph by prayer, faith, brotherly love, and charity: for we testify, in the Spirit of God, that he will be brought off conqueror, and his enemies put to shame.Do you remember his toils and la-bors for your salvation? Nothing but a God has supported him to the present day. His perils are great, and the greatest are among false brethren; and we do entreat the Saints in Zion not to add to his wounds, by following the example of many in Kirtland. Bear with us, ye Saints of God, while we exhort you to keep the Celestial law of God, while in the land of Zion.Be humble, be watchful, be prayerful. Beware of pride, lest you fall like oth-ers. We do not make these remarks for compliment sake, we feel what we say. Kirtland is and will be scourged, to fulfill revelation and prophecy; it is all right, the hand of God is in it.  God's work will not stop. He will work for, and with his Saints. God will redeem Jacob. God will build up Zion. The Lord will establish Jerusa-lem. And O ye Judges in Zion! that God may bestow wisdom and salvation upon you, is the prayer ofWILFORD WOODRUFF,JAMES TOWNSEND, &JOSEPH BALL.

 [stamp] BRIGHAM YOUNG COLLEGE, LOGAN, UTAH.CIRCULAR No. 7.(Circular Addressed by the General Church Board of Education toPresidents of Stakes, June 8th, 1888.)Dear Brethren: A meeting of the General Board of Educa-tion was held today, and the subject of the educational interests ofthe Latter-day Saints was taken into consideration and discussed atsome length.It was decided that a Board of Education, consisting of notless than five and not to exceed eight in number, should be selectedin each Stake to take charge of and promote the interests of edu-cation in the Stake.This communication is addressed to you to inform you of this action, and to have you select energetic men who are friends ofeducation, who understand the needs of the people, and who haveinfluence with the Saints, to carry out any suggestions in this direc-tion that may be deemed desirable.In the decision which was reached by our General Board, it was made the duty of these local Boards to take into consideration the formation of Church Schools, and the best method of accom-plishing this, and after arriving at proper conclusions, to report themto the General Board.Communications of this character may be addressed to Elder George Reynolds, who is Secretary of the Board.It was felt by the General Board that, to begin with, there shouldbe one Stake Academy established in each Stake as soon as practi-cable.The education of our children under correct influences and in the spirit of the gospel ought to be very dear to every Latter-day 
 Saint, and we are impressed that the time has arrived for a com-mencement to be made in this direction.The desire is universally expressed by all thinking people inthe Church, that we should have schools wherein the Bible, the Bookof Mormon, and the book of Doctrine and Covenants can be usedas class books, and wherein the principles of our religion may forma part of the teaching of the schools.To effect this it will be necessary that funds be collected. TheChurch will doubtless do its share; but it cannot carry the entireburden. The Saints must be appealed to.There are hundreds of liberal-minded people among us whoare willing to contribute to this worthy object when they find thesubject is receiving due attention, and that definite and perma-nent arrangements are being made to establish schools of thischaracter.The brethren whom you select to form this Board should be men of character and integrity among the people, who will be able to use an influence in the collection of funds, so that schools maybe established, good faculties be employed, and tuition be made socheap that an education will be within the reach of the humblest inthe land.After you have made a suitable selection for this Board, thenames of the brethren composing it should be presented regularly atyour Stake Conferences as other authorities are, so that the peoplecan vote for them.Very respectfully yours,WILFORD WOODRUFF,Chairman of the Church Board of Education.GEORGE REYNOLDS, Secretary. 
 To the Presidents of Stakes, Stake and Local Boards of Education, andPrincipals and Faculties of all Church Schools:At the commencement of our labors as the General Board ofEducation, the peculiar condition of the Church affairs compelled us to be careful in holding out hopes of financial aid in the organ-izing of new schools; we therefore confined ourselves to the an-nouncement of some of the principles upon which it would be desirable to have our new educational system organized and con-ducted. But the active energy displayed by so many of the Stakesof Zion, in response to our first circular, not only in organizingtheir respective Boards, but also in proceeding at once to raise sub-scriptions to procure furniture and apparatus, and to call for Princi-pals and Teachers, furnishes proof that the time is ripe for the in-troduction of this new educational system, and that the people areready to sustain and carry it out. Applications for assistance tohelp institutions already started and to start others are numerous;but the Board is not, at present, in a position to give all the aidasked for, and must, of necessity, proceed carefully in its disburse-ments.However, we have an unfaltering faith that the Spirit whichprompted the inception of this system of education, will assist inthe progress of the work; until, by united effort, patient presever-ance, sincere devotion, intelligent application, and firm reliance up-on the blessings of God, all our difficulties will be gradually over-come, and our educational affairs be placed upon a satisfactory basisin all the Stakes of Zion.Although the attainment of so desirable an end requires itstime of development, there are a few points within reach, to whichwe desire to call your attention.1st. It is essential that this Board receive an Annual Finan-cial Statement from the Treasurer of each Church School, with suchother items as will more perfectly explain the financial condition ofthe institution, on or before July 15th, of each year. This state- 
 ment should be endorsed by an auditing committee, and counter-signed by the President and Secretary of the Board.2. In connection with the above, we also desire an Annual Statistical Report, signed by the President and Secretary of theBoard, and by the Principal and Secretary of the Faculty.3. The General Superintendent, under instructions from theGeneral Board, will communicate directly with the Principals andTeachers for the purpose of harmonizing their labors in such amanner as will insure to the youth of Zion the greatest amount ofgood, and to the Teachers a sufficient scope for their individuality.4. It will, doubtless, be productive of better results for thePrincipals of the different Stake Academies or Colleges to beappointed by the General Board upon the recommendation of theGeneral Superintendent; yet this will only be done after consulta-tion with the respective Stake Boards to the end that their wishesmay be fully satisfied. The other Teachers should be appointed by the Stake Boards, upon the recommendation of the Principal.5. The system of teaching inaugurated at the Brigham YoungAcademy, of Provo, is that which we wish introduced in all ourChurch Schools.6. All communications between the General Board and Gen-eral Superintendent on the one side, and the Stake Boards orPrincipals and Teachers on the other, should be kept on file forreference.7. The General Superintendent will be instructed by thisBoard to visit the schools at certain intervals, to meet with the res-pective Boards and Faculties, to give instructions and to make suchenquiries as will enable him to render us complete reports from timeto time.CONVENTIONS.All Church Schools are organized into District Conventionsaccording to instructions published in the Juvenile Instructor. TheChairman of each convention will be appointed by the GeneralBoard.An Annual Convention will be held at Salt Lake City, at which all Church Schools should be officially represented. 
 BOARD OF EXAMINERS.A Board of Examiners has been created by the General Board.This Board of Examiners may call to its aid any specialists, as cir-cumstances may require, subject, however, to the approval of the General Board.Course of Procedure Relative to the Examination of Church School Instruc-tors and the Awarding of Certificates and Diplomas.No teacher is eligible to act in any Church School who doesnot hold a License or Certificate from the General Board of Educa-tion.Licenses and Certificates may be obtained under the followingconditions:Annual Licenses. Teachers of at least one year's practical ex-perience, or graduates from one of our Normal Schools, desiring to enter the Church School service, should make written application to the General Superintendent. They should in this applicationpromise to teach in accordance with the instructions given by theGeneral Board of Education. They should enclose their Bishops'Certificates of Church standing, and any testimonials or certificatesof efficiency they may have. If such documents are satisfactory,an Annual License for either the Primary or the IntermediateGrade may be issued, pending examination before the Board of Ex-aminers for a standing certificate in the respective grade.Upon the recommendation of the Board of Examiners, Stand-ing Certificates will be issued by the General Board for the PrimaryGrade, for the Intermediate Grade, and to Specialists for their particu-lar branches, and Diplomas for the Academic Grade, to all successfulcandidates.The title of Professor will be recognized as applicable in ChurchSchools to those only who hold Academic diplomas as specifiedabove.The Board of Examiners will give public notice of the dates and places of annual examinations at least four weeks previousthereto.Candidates for a degree in any of our Academic courses must give notice of their intention to the General Superintendent at least two months before their examination.

In too many instances, in the course of the years, this grand object has been lost sight of in the toil for daily exist-ence, and less noble aims have largely taken the place of the en-deavor to learn the ways of the Lord and of the effort to walk in His paths. This benumbing influence on our spiritual life is widely felt in our homes, and more particularly affects our children, whose faith in the great latter-day work has not been developed and strengthened by the experience which their elders have had in lands beyond the borders of Zion. Nor does the training which our youth receive in the District Schools increase their feelings of devo-tion to God and love for His cause, for, as is well known, all teach- 
 ings of a religious character are rigorously excluded from the stud-ies permitted in these institutions.To lessen this great evil, and counteract the tendencies that grow out of a Godless education, the Church schools of the Saints have been established. But while these accomplish great good, the sphere of their usefulness does not cover the entire field. There are many places where Church schools cannot, at present, be estab-lished; and also many Saints in those places where such schools ex-ist, who, for various reasons, cannot send their children thereto. For these causes we have deemed it prudent to suggest to the vari-ous local authorities other measures which, while not occupying the place of the Church Schools, will work on the same lines, and aid in the same work in which the Church educational institutions are en-gaged.We suggest that in every ward where a Church school is not established, that some brother or sister, or brethren and sisters, well adapted for such a responsible position by their intelligence and devotion, as well as their love for the young, be called, as on a mis-sion, by the Bishop, after consultation with the President of the Stake, to take charge of a school wherein the first principles of the Gospel, Church history, and kindred subjects shall be taught. This school to meet for a short time each afternoon after the close of the district school, or for a longer time on the Saturday only, as may in each ward be deemed most consistent with the situation of the peo-ple and most likely to secure a good attendance of the children. In some cases it will be found that the children are too wearied after their usual daily studies to take interest in a class of this kind; in others, Saturday may prove to be an unsuitable day.Where arrangements can be made it will, as a general thing, be well to secure the district school room for this purpose, so that when they take place in the afternoon, these exercises can commence im-mediately after the regular sessions and before the children scatter; but where this is done care must be taken to keep the two entirely separate, so that the law may not be infringed upon. Where the regular school room cannot be obtained, some building conveniently situated, and as near as possible, should be secured in its stead; the object being to secure the attendance, as far as possible, of the chil-dren of all the Latter-day Saints. A strenuous effort should likewise 
 be made to gain the hearty co-operation of the parents, as without their aid the school will measurably fail in the object of its crea-tion.We deem it desirable that every school thus established should be under the guidance and direction of the General Board of Edu-cation; and those brethren and sisters who accept this call will re-ceive a license from the Board to act in this capacity. Suggestions with regard to the studies, etc., will also be issued by the General Board, and other means be adopted to place these classes in harmony with the methods of the Church School system, of which, in fact, they will form an important part. Where it is found necessary to pay the teacher a small stipend for his services, the General Board of Education should be consulted through the State Board; but it is thought that the incidental expenses for fuel, etc., may, without inconvenience, be met by the ward, or by the people whose children are benefited.With a constant desire for the progress of all true education, we remain, with much respect,Your brethren in the Gospel,WILFORD WOODRUFF,GEORGE Q. CANNON,JOS. F. SMITH,First Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.In accordance with the foregoing circular, the General Board of Education has selected the Juvenile Instructor as the official organ of communication for these Religion Classes and for all our Church Schools. The first number in each month will be used as the medium of Church School papers.It is essential that such copies of the Juvenile Instructor be kept on file for reference in all Church Schools and Religion Classes.CONDUCTING OF CHURCH SCHOOLS.The Academic Year.The General Board has been informed that a few of our Stake Boards intend to continue their schools only part of the academic 
 year. As no efficient teacher can be expected to accept such a tem-porary engagement, it is obvious that these schools would have to depend on "makeshift" arrangements, to the detriment of their pupils and in opposition to the high aim of our educational system. We, therefore, desire that Stake Academies make no deviation from the regular academic year of forty weeks without consulting the General Superintendent.Buildings and Furniture.The General Board of Education has repeatedly been asked to furnish plans for school buildings, but in consideration of the variety of conditions, plans generally applicable can not be furnished. We call the attention of the Boards of Education to the fact that an elaborate architectural edifice is not essential for a successful school, but that the consideration of the teachers' support, the health and the comfort of students, and the condition of school furniture and uten-sils is of far greater importance.Circulars.Several of the circulars heretofore published by Stake and Local Boards have not been in conformity with the instructions of the General Board. We urge upon you the necessity of care in this respect, and recommend that you correspond with the General Superintendent before introducing any essential variation.Principals and Faculties.Members of faculties, Principals excepted, should not hold office in the Stake Boards. Principals are "ex-officio" members of their respective Stake Boards.In order to regulate the somewhat irregular mode of cor-respondence that has been carried on between the Principals and the General Superintendent, it is found necessary to have at least one official communication per term from each Principal to the General Superintendent, furnishing such information as may enable the latter to properly represent the respective institution in his re-ports to the President of the General Board.The Principals will please furnish the General Superintendent 
 a complete list of their regular and special teachers, with respective curricula, salaries, length of service in the institution, and all other data of interest.Should a new department be organized or an old one be dis-continued in any Stake Academy or Seminary by the Local Board, such action should be reported to the General Superintendent.When Missionary Meetings and Polysophical Societies are organized, care must be taken that the interests of Sunday Schools and Mutual Improvement Associations be not interfered with, but rather that the influence of our teachers be directed to in support of those institutions.The General Superintendent should be furnished with copies of the Daily Programs, and Principals' Reports. Suggestions tend-ing to bring gradually our whole educational system into an har-monious whole will be gladly received. He should also be notified, at a reasonably early date, of every public examination to be held.Teachers' Salaries.The amount of salaries for Principals and Teachers is left, at present,  to mutual agreement between the respective Boards and Teachers, but care must be taken that the terms to be made upon the basis of strict business principles, and they be honorably adhered to.Libraries.Each Church School should have the following books in its Libra-ry, as they are considererd indispensable: 1. Unabridged Dictionary.  2. Encyclopedia. 3. All the standard Church works and publi-cations. 4. Popular text books in all branches taught, beside those adopted, for reference, by teachers and students. 5. Revised Laws of Utah. 6. Ordinances of the city in which the institution is located. 7. History of the World.Current Literature.  1. We recommend that each institution keep the Deseret News, Juvenile Instructor, and local papers, also one or more educational, scientific, and literary magazines.A catalogue of all books and papers should be strictly kept and the books classified. In connection with the Library there should be a Reading Room. 
 Cabinets.A cabinet of specimens, for illustration, is indispensable to the study of the sciences.Valuable specimens may be obtained: by excursions to mountains, caves, mines, factories, gardens, fields and places of note; also by exchanges of duplicates, and by contributions from patrons, students, and missionaries abroad. The specimens should be correctly classified, labeled and catalogued.Pieces of apparatus, such as cannot be made under the super-vision of the teacher, may be obtained advantageously by consulting with the Principals of our Colleges.Records.Besides the blanks for the Statistical and Financial Annual Reports, furnished by the General Board, the following records are deemed necessary to be kept with the greatest care, by the respec-tive Principals and their assistants:1. General or Annual Record with accompanying Index, con-taining name, age, parentage, home, time of entering, depart-ments, attendance during each term, Church standing, remarks, etc., of each pupil.2. Records of Plans and Programs containing the grading and plans for all courses and classes for each term of the school year.3. Register of Studies, containing the reports of the class work per week.4. Minutes of Faculty, containing also the Principal s Reports, Programs of Examination, and Minutes of Academic Councils.5. Records of Standing, containing the percentage of standing of the students in their respective departments and classes; from which every parent or guardian should be furnished an abstract at the end of the term.6. Teachers  Records of Daily Attendance and Preparation.NOTE. The mode of keeping some of these records will have to be left optional with each Principal, provided that the records themselves are kept, subject to the inspection of the General Superintendent at his periodical visits.Historical Records.The importance of keeping historical records of our Church 
 School organization can not be over-estimated, and in order that the Church Historian be in a position to keep an accurate record of our educational movement, the General Superintendent is required to furnish him annually a summary from the special reports of the various Church Schools. The special report of each institution should be drawn up by the Principal thereof, and, after being endorsed by the President and Secretary of the respective Boards, should be sent to the General Superintendent on or before July 15, every year.Lady Teachers.We urgently recommend that each of our Church Schools have the benefit of a Lady Teacher not only qualified to instruct inthe common branches, but also able to conduct ladies' work, have special charge of the lady students, and, if possible, be acquainted with the principles of  Physiology, Hygiene, Domestic Science, Drawing, Music, and Kindergarten work.General Circular No. 6 contains particulars for the guidance of our Lady Teachers.Music Teachers.Great importance should be attached to the cultivation of Music in our Church Schools. It is, therefore, recommended that the various Boards of Education make it their special care to procure competent Music Teachers.Theology.Having learned of the great success attending the use of the Sunday School Leaflets and Picture Charts in the Primary and Preparatory, of the "Story of the Book of Mormon" in the Interme-diate, and of the Juvenile Instructor in all of these departments in some of our schools, the General Board recommends the adoption of these publications throughout our Church School organization, in addition to the text-books already in use. It is the intention of the Church Authorities to cause other theological works to be pre-pared with special reference to the needs of our Church Schools.Discipline.A judicious teacher will rarely have occasion to supplant emu-lative means of discipline by compulsory ones. 
 Academic Councils. In serious cases of misdemeanor, or when all available means of discipline have been exhausted, the Principal may refer the case to the action of an Academic Council, accord-ing to the following procedure: The Principal should notify in writing the President of his Board, and request the summoning of an Academic Council to try the case. The President should ap-point a meeting of that Council at the earliest possible convenience, and cause the parents or guardians of the defendant to be notified also of the time and place of the trial. The Academic Council should be composed of at least three members of the Board, and the Principal and regular teachers of the school. The President, or some other member of the Board, appointed by the former for the occasion, presiding. Copies of the charge and the minutes of the proceedings must be kept on record. In case of expulsion, no such defendant can enter any other Church School until forgiveness from the Academic Council that expelled him has been obtained.  The General Superintendent must be notified of all such cases. The spirit and mode of procedure in the High Councils should be taken as a pattern on all such occasions.No Principal or Teacher has a right to expel a student from school without the action of the Academic Council.GRADING OF DEPARTMENTS.No student should be considered qualified to enter any depart-ment unless able to pursue successfully at least two of the studies enumerative under "GRADING," in such department.Primary Department.GRADING. Chart Class to II Readers. Elementary Arithmetic, as far as Division. Simple Lessons in Language.CURRICULUM.

Thus it may happen that students of the Preparatory or Intermediate grades be entered in the Academic class in Theology, and vice versa.Primary: Simple stories from the Bible, the Book of Mormon and Church History.Preparatory: Life of Christ, Acts of the Apostles, and Book of Mormon History.Intermediate: Selections from Doctrine and Covenants, Book of Mormon, and synopsis of the books of the Bible.Academic: A systematic and somewhat exhaustive study of the principles and ordinances of the Gospel as arranged in the Compen- 
 dium, alternating with Church History and Book of Mormon Chronology. Students should be supplied with the standard works of the Church. The Authorities have in contemplation the issu-ance of a special work for use in Academic theological classes.Besides daily recitations on the above subjects.Devotional Exercises should be held morning and evening:General Repetition Classes should be held weekly, and the stu-dents divided into small quorums to review the past week s work in Theology.Priesthood Meetings should be organized to hear repetition re-ports and to acquaint the members more fully with the duties and organization of the Priesthood.A General Theological Class should be held weekly, in which all departments should participate, and interesting programs be rendered.In all grades, however, it should be the main object of the teachers to cultivate in the hearts of their pupils a living testimony of the truth of the latter-day work.THE DOMESTIC FEATURE OF OUR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM.In regard to our Domestic Regulations, of such potent influence in forming the character of the students, the Boards and Faculties will consider the circumstances of their localities, and advance step by step in the introduction of rules, which will assist them in the accomplishment of the object of the glorious mission given to us for the elevation of the youth of Zion. Such regulations should not be fetters to obstruct the exercise of free agency, but stakes to indicate the road to the attainment of the virtues of self-control and sense of duty.A leading feature of the Church School system is the cultiva-tion of the character and the control of the deportment of the stu-dent in and out of school. All students, on entering any of our schools, should be placed upon their word of honor to observe con-scientiously the rules and regulations of the school. A bi-weekly meeting should be held, in which the reports of visitors appointed by the Principal should be received, and general instructions be given pertaining to the behavior and well-being of the students.

 May 23rd, 1891.Presidents Woodruff and Cannon,Gardo House, City;Dear Brethren: In accordance with your request, I have con-sulted with Brother Trejo regarding his position as teacher of Spanish, and the remuner-ation he would desire during the summer months. Not finding you at your office today,and expecting to leave for Europe to-morrow, I take this manner of reporting to you theresults. My opinion of Brother Trejo's efficiency as a teacher, as also upon the successwhich has attended his labors with our students in Spanish, I have already expressed toyou. He seems well satisfied with the arrangements of the past, in matters of salary.He dislikes the thought of having to abandon the work altogether, and return to unsuit-able labor for a livelihood, during the summer vacation, and says he would be well satis-fied with half pay until the next school year opens. This, I believe, covers the extentof the enquiries you directed me to make.

 I had an Interview ^with several Pottowatamie chiefs, who came to su [us]^ between Joseph Smith & the Potowatamie chiefsme during my absence, and remained until the presentwritten by W WoodruffNote from W Woodruffs JournalSevaral of the potawatamie Chiefs came to Nauvoo for the purpose ofHaving an interview with the Prophet Joseph Smith, at the time of their arival Hehad gone to Dixon upon a visit, was kidnaped, while there and efforts made torun him to Missouri "The Indians Chiefs ^who^ remain at Nauvoo untill theprophet returned & had his trial during their stay thay had a conv talk withHiram Smith in the basement of the Nauvoo House. W Woodruff & some otherswere presant. they were not free to talk & did not wish to communicatetheir feelings untill they could see the great ^Prophet^ propheit. At length onthe 2nd day of July 1843 President Joseph Smith ^& councollars & some of the 12^ met those Chiefsin the chamber of his store ^Court room^ with about 20 of the Elders the following is asynopsis of the conversation which took place as given by the interpeter whoaccompanid them. The Indian Orator arose & asked the prophet if those ^the^ menwho ware present were all his Friends. Answer yes. He then said "we as apeople have long been distressed and oppressd we have been driven from our landsmany times we have been wasted away by wars untill there is ^are^ but few of us left thewhite man has hated us & shed our blood untill it has appeared as though their wouldsoon be no Indian Left. we have talked with the great spirit & the great spirit hastalked with us we have asked the great Spirit to save us & Let us live and the greatspirit has told us that he had raised us up a great Prophet aChief & Friend unto uswho woudld do us great good & tell us what to do and the great spirit has told usthat you are the man (Pointing to the Prophet Joseph) we have now come a great ways to seeyou & to hear your words & to have you tell us what to do, Our Horses have become poor traveling & we arehungry, we will now wait & hear your word," the spirit of God rested upon the Lamanits esspecallythe Orator who spoke Joseph was much eaffected & shed tears. He arose & said unto them "I have heardyour words they are true, the great spirit has told you the truth, I am your friend & Brother & Iwish to do you good your Fathers was ^were^ once a great people they worshipd the great spirit the Greatspirit done ^did^ them good He was their friend but they left the great spirit & would not hear his words or

 616 THE DESERET NEWS Oct 12DESERET NEWS:WEEKLYTRUTH AND LIBERTYPRINTED AND PUBLISHED BY THEDESERET NEWS COMPANYCHARLES W. PENROSE, EDITOR.WEDNESDAY, - Oct 12, 1887.AN EPISTLETo the Members of the Church ofJesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. INTRODUCTORY.Dear Brothers and Sisters:It appears proper, at this Fifty-eighthSemi-annual Conference of the Churchof Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,that an epistle should be addressed tothe members of the Church, in con-formity with the custom which hasbeen observed at the past five GeneralConferences.DEATH OF PRESIDENT TAYLOR.As some of the Apostles are pre-vented, by circumstances well knownto the Saints, from appearing in pub-lic, the Church will naturally look forsome expression from them concern-ing their feelings and hopes respectingthe work of our God. Especially at thepresent time is deep interest felt in theutterances of the Apostles, because ofthe loss which the Church has sus-tained in the death of PRESIDENT JOHNTAYLOR. Twice before has the Churchmourned the death of its President,and each time the event has produceda profound impression upon its mem-bers. In this instance this sad eventis invested with more significance thanit would have been had it occurred inthe ordinary way. President Taylordied in exile. For about two yearsand a half he had been compelled tolive in seclusion, and to refrain fromall public association with the peoplewhom he loved more than he did life.Through his decease the Church iscalled the third time to mourn the de-parture of the man who has stood asits President and as the Prophet, Seerand Revelator to this generation. Theexperience which the Saints havegained in passing through these trialshas been of exceeding value to them.They have learned that God can takecare of his own work, and that theyneed not worry nor yield to anxiety ordoubt concerning its management.After the martyrdom of the ProphetJoseph there were pretenders who as-serted that they had the right to takehis place at the head of the Church.Some were deceived by their preten-sions, not being familiar with the or-der of the Priesthood.THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THEAPOSTLES.For some time before his death theProphet Joseph was inspired of theLord to anticipate his own departurefrom earthly scenes. This was shownin various ways; but especially in thegreat anxiety which he displayed tobestow upon the Twelve Apostles allthe keys and authority of the HolyPriesthood which he had received. Hedeclared in private and in public thatthey were equipped and fully qualified,and that he had rolled the kingdom ofGod on to the shoulders of the TwelveApostles.PRESIDENT WOODRUFF'S PERSONALTESTIMONY.I, Wilford Woodruff, being the lastman living in the flesh who was pres-ent upon that occasion feel it a duty Iowe to the Church of Jesus Christ ofLatter-day Saints, to the House ofIsrael, and to the whole world to bearthis is my last testimony to all nations,that in the winter of 1843-4, JosephSmith, the Prophet of God, called theTwelve Apostles together in the Cityof Nauvoo, and spent many days withus in giving us our endowments, andteaching us those glorious principleswhich God had revealed to him. Andupon one occasion he stood upon hisfeet in our midst for nearly threehours declaring unto us the great andlast dispensation which God had setHis hand to perform upon the earth inthese last days. The room was filledas if with consuming fire; the Prophetwas clothed upon with much of thepower of God, and his face shone andwas transparently clear, and he closedthat speech, never-to-be-forgotten intime or in eternity, with the followinglanguage: Brethren, I have had great sorrowof heart for fear that I might be takenfrom the earth with the keys of theKingdom of God upon me, withoutsealing them upon the heads of othermen. God has sealed upon my headall the keys of the Kingdom of Godnecessary for organizing and build-ing up of the Church, Zion, andKingdom of God upon the earth, andto prepare the Saints for the comingof the Son of Man. Now, brethren, Ithank God I have lived to see the daythat I have been enabled to give youyour endowments, and I have nowsealed upon your heads all the powersof the Aaronic and Melchesidek Priest-hoods and Apostleship, with all thekeys and powers thereof, which Godhas sealed upon me; and I know roll offall the labor, burden and care of thisChurch and Kingdom of God uponyour shoulders, and I now commandyou in the name of the Lord JesusChrist to round up your shoulders,and bear off this Church and Kingdom ofGod before heaven and earth, and be-fore God, angels and men; and if youdon't do it you will be damned. And the same spirit that filled theroom at that time burns in my bosomwhile I record this testimony, and theProphet of God appointed no one elsebut the Twelve Apostles to stand atthe head of the Church and direct itsaffairs.THE PRESIDENCY IN THE APOSTLES.When the Prophet Joseph hadpassed away by foul assassination,those who possessed the Spirit of Godand were living in close communionwith it, knew the voice of the trueshepherd and were not deceived by theclaims of men who pretended to haveauthority. The body of the Churchfollowed the leadership of those whomGod had chosen, and whom His ser-vant Joseph had been instructed toprepare for this great responsibility.The Twelve Apostles, with PresidentBrigham Young as their head, becamethe presiding council of the Church.The lessons which the Church thenlearned in regard to the Priesthood,and the rights of the Priesthood, havenever been forgotten. When Presi-dent Young was taken from us, therewas no jar nor division of sentimentamong the Apostles; and among thepeople there was scarcely a question asto where the right of Presidency rest-ed. President John Taylor took theposition which belonged to him, andthe work of God moved forward with-out interruption, and with a union andharmony on the part of all connectedwith it, most delightful to wit-ness. He has stood at our headfor nearly ten years, and during thatperiod he has possessed the gifts andqualifications which belonged to hishigh office and calling. His entirecareer is one that can be contemplatedwith the utmost satisfaction and pleas-ure by all who love the truth and ad-mire integrity in those who are calledto be servants of God. From the timethat he was baptized a member of theChurch until his spirit took its flightfrom earth, he never wavered in his ad-vocacy and defense of the principles ofrighteousness. Under all the variedcircumstances through which he andthe people of God were called to pass,in the midst of the deepest trials andafflictions, his voice was always raisedin tones of encouragement and hope;and when the storms were the fiercest,he rose to the occasion and alwaysdisplayed undaunted courage and un-flinching devotion to the Zion of God.In the providence of God it fell to hislot to be with the Prophet Joseph andPatriarch Hyrum when they weremartyred for the truth, and he mingledhis own blood with theirs. Thoughseverely wounded on that occasion,he miraculously escaped death. Hewas a man whom the Lord loved.The evidence of this is to be found inthe fact that He [c]hose him to presideover His Church at the departure ofHis servant Brigham. We feel thank-ful to God our Eternal Father that wehave been permitted to live with andenjoy the society of President JohnTaylor and his fellow-laborers.Our assocation with him and thePresidents and Apostles who havegone before him into the spirit world,we esteem as a great honor. We takedelight in anticipating the rejoicingthat we shall have when we shall bepermitted to mingle in their society.Once more, the responsibility ofpresiding over the Church has fallenupon the Council of the TwelveApostles. The Counselors of Presi-dent Taylor, Brothers George Q.Cannon and Joseph F. Smith, beingmembers of the Council of the TwelveApostles at the time they were chosento be members of the First Presidency,have, since his death, taken their placesagain as members of that Council.Fifty-seven years and a half haveelapsed since the Church was organ-ized. In looking around among thosewith whom we associate to-day, howfew there are left of those who, underthe Lord, helped to lay . thefoundation of this work and were thecompanions of the Prophet in theearly labors connected therewith.To-day there is but one Apostle leftof those who belonged to the Councilof the Apostles during the lifetime ofthe Prophet Joseph, or, indeed, at thetime these valleys were first settled.The other faithful Apostles who wereordained under the direction of theProphet Joseph have all passed behindthe veil. Since the death of PresidentYoung four have joined him in theother world, and in the same periodsix have been ordained as membersof the Council of the Twelve Apostles.This gives some idea of the changeswhich are occurring, and how rapidlya new generation is taking an activepart in the building up of Zion.THE LABORS OF THE APOSTLES.Those of us who have been at libertyto travel, have devoted our time tovisiting the various Stakes, and inmeeting with them at their QuarterlyConferences. Some of us have beenlaboring in Mexico, others in Arizona,besides visiting the Stakes in Idahoand in Utah. These Quarterly Con-ferences are attended with excellentresults. The people come togetherand receive instructions and coun-sel upon leading topics, andmuch good is derived therefrom.Though it involves considerable laborfor the Apostles to visit them, yet weare encouraged in doing so by the ad-vantages which those visits bring tothe people in keeping them informedconcerning general movements andcounsel. In these labors we have hadmuch joy and satisfaction, especiallyin witnessing the increase of faithful-ness on the part of the Saints.THE PATIENCE OF THE SAINTS.Though many of the leading menhave been compelled to be absent,some of them having been incarcer-ated in prison, the people have, never-theless, been steadfast, and havesought with increased dilligence to per-form their duties. The persecution towhich they have been subjected hasled the people to think and act forthemselves, and not to depend somuch upon others for guidance. Thiscan not fail to be attended with goodresults. It is necessary that all themembers of the Church should exer-cise their powers of reason and reflec-tion and thoroughly understand whythey take the course which God pointsout. Intelligent obedience on the partof His Saints is desired by our Fatherin heaven. He has given us our agencyto think and act for ourselves,on our own volition, to obtain atestimony for ourselves from Himconcerning the truth of the principleswhich He teaches, and then be firmand unshaken in the performance ofall which is necessary for salvation.We have felt great satisfaction inwitnessing the dignity and couragewhich the Saints have exhibitedthrough the trials of the past threeyears. Their conduct has been ad-mirable. They have displayed greatqualities. The forbearance, patienceand fortitude which they have ex-hibited are proofs that God has beenwith them. Outrages which wouldhave goaded any other people into actsof violence have been of frequent oc-currence. In other communities menand women would be desperate undersuch treatment. But the Lord hasgiven His people power to controlthemselves and peace has been main-tained. Riots and bloodshed havebeen avoided, and even under strongprovocation, when blood was shed, thecommunity restrained itself. Preju-dice may prevent our nation and itsrulers from acknowledging at thepresent, how noble the demeanor ofthe people has been underthese trying circumstances, andwith the strong provocationswhich they have had to indulge inoutbreaks; yet the time will comewhen all this will receive its properrecognition and due credit will be ac-corded to the Latter-day Saints to theirmagnanimity and self-control through-out this entire persecution.PRIMARY ASSOCIATIONS, ETC.In the organizations which havebeen established among our people inall our settlements in these moun-tains, the advancement and trainingand benefit of all classes are amplyprovided for. Among no people ofwhom we know anything have suchprovisions been made for the salvationand care of the members of society ofall ages as among the Latter-daySaints. If we and our children do notprogress in intelligence and in theknowledge of all principles pertainingto life here and life hereafter, it is be-cause we do not avail ourselves ofthose facilities which are placed withinour reach. We have the Primary As-sociations provided for the benefit ofthe young children of our Church, andtheir instruction in those simple prin-ciples which they can understand. Wealso have Sunday schools for thetraining and education of those oflarger growth. In them they can learnthe doctrines of salvation and the his-tory of the work of God, and be pre-pared for greater progress. Then wehave the Young Mens  and YoungLadies  Mutual Improvement Asso-ciations, which have been organized, astheir names imply, for the developmentof the young people of both sexes andtheir advancement in every thing thatwill qualify them for lives of useful-ness and honor. But besides these or-ganizations we have the various coun-cils of the Priesthood, to some officein which every young man who isworthy can be ordained. The youngwomen, as they increase in years, canalso find a sphere of usefulness in theRelief Societies which have been or-ganized for the purposes of assistingthe Bishops and Counselors andTeachers of the Wards in caring forthe poor and relieving the wants of thesuffering and distressed. So that bymeans of these organizations, whichare of vast interest to us as a people,every one from early childhood to ma-turity, can be led forward step by step,from one degree of knowledge to an-other until fully qualified to dischargeall the duties of perfevted and honor-able manhood and womanhood.So far as we know the sisters whohave charge of the Primary Associa-tion are doing a most commendablework in arousing interest in the lit-tle ones and in teaching themin simple style those lessonswhich are adapted to their under-standings. We hope that in all oursettlements these associations will re-ceive the constant care and attentionof our wise and judicious sisters. Theseed sown in the hearts of the childrenby the instructions imparted therewill produce in years to come anabundant harvest that will gladden thehearts of the Saints who witness it.OUR SUNDAY SCHOOLS, ETC.The progress of the Sunday Schoolcause in Zion continues satisfactory,though undoubtedly somewhat re-tarded by the enforced absence fromits labors and associations of so manybrethren and sisters who have informer years taken an active interestin its welfare. We notice, with pleas-ure, the constantly increasing numberof schools, teachers and scholars re-ported by the officers of the Union andthe evident care taken by the presidinglocal authorities in our settlements tohave a Sunday School as one of thefirst institutions established. Weare also gratified to learn thatin most of the foreign missionsof the Church Sunday Schoolsand Improvement Associationsare being organized whereverpracticable. In Great Britain, in Con-tinental Europe, in New Zealand, andin the Sandwich Islands, as also in thebranches scattered throughout themissions in the United States, theseinstitutions are found contributingtheir influence in instructing andforming the character of the childrenof the Latter-day Saints.The Mutual Improvement Societiesare also accomplishing great goodthroughout our settlements. In connec-tion with them and the Sunday Schools,we desire to remind our brethren andsisters who are engaged in the praise-worthy labor of fostering these insti-tutions, that the original design inorganizing Sunday Schools and Im-provement Societies among us was,that the children and youth of theSaints should be made wise in theprinciples of the Gospel and their faithbe developed in the revelations ofGod. This the officers and teachersshould keep constantly in mind. Thebooks used should be almost without exception,the reveleations of God ascontained in ancient and modern Scripture,together with the other worksof the Church. The teachings,while direct, brief and simple, shouldbe such as will increase the faith, de-velop the veneration and love, anddraw out the intelligence of the youth-ful bearers toward the divine princi-ples of which by God's grace, we havebeen made the custodians. All at-tempts, however slight, to secularizethese institutions and to change themso that they will not accomplish theends sought for in their creation,should be discountenanced. Thespirit and teachings of the Gospelshould hold undivided control in allour ministrations connected with thiscause. In the theological and otherclasses all discussions should beavoided as much as possible on sub-jects which God in His wisdom has notyet fully revealed. We know there aremany persons who appear to take moredelight in dwelling upon questionswhich are mysterious and cannot verywell, in our present stae of knowl-edge, be answered than they do uponthose subjects which are plain andsimple and essential to present pro-gress. But the Lord has revealedso much that we can understandand that we ought to learn in order tobe useful in the labors devolving uponus here, that we need not enter intodiscussions on subjects which [in] noway affect our happi[n]ess here or eter-nal salvation hereafter. In our theo-logical classes, quorum meetings andothe assemblies, therefore, these de-batable questions need not be dis-cussed or be dwelt upon to occupy thetime of the members, to the exclusionof more profitable topics. In thePrimary Associations, the Sundayschools and the Mutual ImprovementAssociations, singing should receive alarge share of attention. Singing ex-ercises can be made a great attractionand also a valuable addition to the ed-ucation of the young. The interestthat is now taken among us in vocaland instrumental music is a markedfeature of the times, and this tastefinds increasing opportunities for itsdevelopment in the facilities which arenow being furnished to all who desireits cultivation. Instead of having aselect few act as choirs in theseinstitutions to do the singing for thewhole, the voices of all shouldbe united in harmonious melodyin giving utterance to the feelings oftheir hearts in hymns and songs. Thiswill increase the pleasure of the meet-ings, and make all feel that they havean equal interest in worship and re-joicing.THE RELIEF SOCIETIES.The mission of the Relief Societiesas organized among us, is truly grandand beneficent. There is no limit totheir labors and usefulness while suf-fering and want exist in our midst. Toaid the needy by feeding the hungryand clothing the destitute is distinc-tively and peculiarly their mission. Inthe energetic performance of theirduty human sympathy and divinemercy are beautifully harmonized. Inextending relief to the poor, the loveof God and of our fellows is clearlymanifest. It is more praiseworthy fora relief society to be able to say There are none in our Ward in needof food, raiment or shelter,  than toreport thousands of dollars in hand,while the needs of the poor are un-supplied.These societies have done a vastamount of good among us, and themembers have been of greate service inassisting the Priesthood in the wardsin caring for the destitute and in sup-plying the wants of those who havebeen in need of help. In these laborswe desire to give them every encour-agement and to invoke the blessing ofheaven upon them, and all their exer-tions for the benefit of suffering hu-manity.THE CARE OF THE POOR.As the winter season is approaching,it is proper that each Bishop and hisCounselors should take the necessarysteps to properly care for the poorwho live in their wards. They shouldcall the Relief Societies to their aid inthis labor. The reasonable wants ofthe poor should be supplied and thepangs of poverty and destitationshould be averted. God has greatlyblessed us in the fruits of our fieldsand gardens, in our flocks and herds,and in giving us comfortable habita-tions and means to sustain ourselves,and we should always remember thewords of the Apostle James:  Purereligion and undefiled before God andthe Father is this, to visit the father-less and widows in their affliction, andto keep himself unspotted from theworld. While it has always been thepolicy of our people to encourage in-dustry and to repress idleness to everyform, and to expect all persons tocontribute, according to their ability,to their own support; still there aremany cases where the aged and the in-firm, or the unfortunate, cannot, withthe utmost exertion and economy, ob-tain through their own labors suffi-cient to sustain themselves. It wouldbe a great evil among us to encourageany class in living upon the benevo-lence of the community. No systemof begging should be permitted.Those able to work should be fur-nished employment. Persons who areproperly disposed will be glad to ob-tain it in preference to being fed withthe bread of charity; and all shouldbe encouraged to labor according totheir strength. This policy, if wiselypursued will prevent pauperism, de-velop self exertion and confidence, andproduce self-respect. It is a causeof great pleasure to think that beg-gary is unknown throughout our set-tlements. There is no need for any-one, however destitute, to publiclysolicit alms. But while this is thecase, the sensitive and those whoshrink from asking aid, who concealin some instances, their poverty,should be carefully looked after by theRelief Societies under the direction ofthe Bishops of the wards, so that theremay be no individual in any of ourwards suffering for the want of food orany other article necessary to sustainor preserve life. The community whosehearts are open to the cries of distress,who are ready to administer of thesubstance which the Lord gives themto relieve their fellow creatures, mayalways depend upon the favor of theLord, for he loves those who are kindto their fellow-men, and who admin-ister to their necessities, whose heartsare tender, and who readily respond toapplications of this character whichare made upon them, or who antici-pate them by giving freely to the desti-tute.FAST OFFERINGS.In some of our wards there is notproper care taken in the collection ofthe fast offerings of the people. Thefirst Thursday in the month has beenset apart in the Church as a day offasting and prayer. That day shouldbe strictly observed. Fast offeringsshould be brought with a liberal handto the Bishop of each ward, that hemay be prepared to supply those whoare dependent upon the ward for su-stenance. Some wards require consid-erable aid from the Church to helpsustain their poor, because their ownfast offerings do not supply them;while sometimes in the same Stakethere are other wards where there arefew, if any, dependent poor. Presidentsof Stakes should make arrangementswith the Bishops of the last namedwards to transfer their fast offeringsto the Bishop of some contiguousward which has more poor within itsborders than its own fast offeringswill supply. In this way all the peo-ple can have an equal opportunity ofdoing their duty to the poor.THE LESSONS OF LIBERALITY.Experience has abundantly provedthat those who are attentive to thoseand all other duties required by theLord receieve His blessing. God doesbless those who devote themselveswith singleness of purpose to Hiswork. If proof of this were needed,one has only to notice the condition ofElders in the various settlements whohave spent years of their lives uponmissions. Though their home affairsmay have been left to the care of theirwives and children, they are not dis-tinguished by their poverty from theirfellow-servants who have remained athome.We have only to look around us tosatisfy ourselves also, that those whoare generous in contributing to God'swork are favored of the Lord. Thiswas the experience of ancient Israel,and it is our experience. Yet in re-gard to voluntary donations there istoo much carelessness, not withstand-ing all the precious promises con-nected therewith. The Saints shouldbe reminded of the obligation whichrests upon them. Our children, also,should be taught this duty, that it maybecome a fixed habit with them topunctually attend to these matters.Those who have strictly observedthese requirements can testify to thegreat pleasure and many rewards theyhave received from their observance.This law of liberality appears to beone of the safeguards which the Lordhas adopted to avert from his peoplethe evil consequences which followthe possession of wealth. He has toldus that the riches of the earth are Histo give; but He has warned us to be-ware of pride, lest we become as theNephites of old. We know the ruin itwrought for them, and we shouldspare no precaution to prevent wealthhaving a disastrous effect upon us.Many can endure poverty and be hum-ble and live near the Lord who cannotbear riches. They become lifted up to 
 Oct. 12 THE DESERT NEWS 617pride and become covetous, and for-get their God. Those, however, whoremember constantly the teachings ofthe Lord concerning the earth and itsinhabitants, and who contribute of themeans which the Lord [ink splot] [g]ives them toassist the poor and help carry forwardthe work of God, exercise a check uponthemselves and give Satan less powerto lead them astray. Under the pres-ent system of affairs, those who ac-cumulate wealth and are able to sup-ply themselves and their families withluxuries and advantages that are de-nied their neighbors, are in danger ofbecoming separated from the bulk ofthe people and forming a distinctclass. But the day will come when amore perfect order will be introduced.Then it will be said there are no poorand no rich in Zion that is, we shallnot be divided into classes, but shallall possess everything of this charac-ter necessary for our comfort and hap-piness. But until then, if we wish ourfamilies and ourselves to remain Lat-ter-day Saints, we must be especiallycareful to guard against the deceitful-ness of riches.THE DUTIES OF THE SAINTS.The great labor which devolves uponus, as members of the Church, is tobuild up Zion. God has founded Zion,and we should seek to extend its bene-fits and blessings until all mankind. Itshould be our constant care to donothing that will weaken its influenceor power or retard its growth in theearth. This we should constantly im-press also, upon our children, thatthey may grow up filled with an abid-ing love for the work of God.There has been too much neglecton this point. Many have pursued ashort-sighted, selfish policy; and haveworked to that which they believedwas their own individual advantagewithout regard to the effect their ac-tion would have upon the work of God.Their eyes have not been single to Hisglory. Such a disposition has proveda snare to those who have indulged init; they have wrought injury to them-selves, not to mention the effect theirconduct has had upon Zion.THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF MARRIAGE.The Lord has informed us that mar-riage is ordained of God unto man.The instutition of marriage, in somecommunities of which we read, is fall-ing almost into disrepute. It is al-leged that there is a growing tendencyin this direction among us. The causeis doubtless, traceable to the in-crease of wealth and the dis-inclination of young men to takeupon them the burdens of a wife andfamily. As we depart from the sim-plicity of early days, we may naturallyexpect that this tendency will increaseas young men may be restrained fromoffering marriage to young ladies un-less they can give them something likeas comfortable a home as they enjoyunder their parents' roof. Extrava-gant or luxuriant habits or training onthe part of the girls will also have theeffect to deter young men from marry-ing. Care should be taken by everyperson of influence to conteract thistendency, and to set before the risinggeneration the advantages which fol-low well-arranged marriages. Nocommunity can prosper and maintaina high standard of morality wherethere is a large percentage of unmar-ried young men and young women.We should deplore the increase ofsuch a class among us, and all honor-able means should be used to preventits existence. The young of bothsexes should be taught that it is notnecessary to happiness in marriageto be in the possession of wealth. Inthis country an industrious, economi-cal married couple can soon surroundthemselves with all the conveniencesand comforts essential to life and hap-piness. The satisfaction each willhave in after years in the enjoymentof the fruits of their joint industry andthrift will amply repay them for any in-conveniences or privations they mayhave been subjected to in the earlydays of their married life. The com-forts thus accumulated will be doublysweeted unto them by the recollec-tion of their exertions in common toprocure them. No rightly constitutedand educated young woman will refusean offer of marriage from a worthy, in-dustrious young man for no other rea-son than that he is not able to surroundher at first with the comforts whichshe may think she ought to have.Young men who have a due share ofthe qualities which women esteem ina husband need not be afraid that girlsof that kind will refuse them, becausethey may not be well endowed withthis world's goods. They will cheer-fully bear their part of the burdens oflife without repining when confident ofthe love and supporting and guidinghand of their husbands.AGAINST INCURRING DEBT.We feel led to caution the Latter-day Saints against forming the badhabit of incurring debt and takingupon themselves obligations which fre-quently burden them heavier than theycan bear, and lead to the loss of theirhomes and other possessions. We knowit is the fashion of the age to use creditto the utmost limit, and it is custom-ary for nations, states, counties andcities to borrow money, issue bondsand thus load themselves with taxesto such an extent that large numbersof the people are prevented from own-ing land or even the houses which theyoccupy. Thus the masses become ten-tants and have to pay rent for land andshelter. This is a great evil and onethat we, as a people and as individuals,should carefully shun. Our businessshould be done, as much as possible,on the principle of paying for thatwhich we purchase, and our needsshould be brought within the limit ofour resources. The disposition tospeculate and to take chances uponventures of one kind and anothershould be repressed. There are manypeople who have been rendered home-less in our Territory by the neglect ofthis precaution. To raise funds to in-vest in some scheme which has ap-peared promising they have mortgagedtheir homes, only too often, to be dis-appointed and to find themselves with-out a place of shelter for themselvesand their families. All this is wrong.If the penalty for such unwisdom fellupon the one who through those acts andinfluence it is brought about the con-sequences would not be so deplorable;but very frequently families sufferand the bad results are widelyfelt. We, therefore, repeat ourcounsel to the Latter-day Saints,to shun debt. Be content with mod-erate gains, and be not misled by illu-sory hopes of acquiring wealth. Re-member the saying of the wise man: But he that hasteth to get richshall not be innocent.  Let our chil-dren also be taught habits of economy,and not to indulge in tastes whichthey cannot gratify without running indebt.ZION SHALL NOT BE REMOVED.We have been favored, as no otherpeople have, with wise counsels.Their extent and variety are immeas-urable. They cover every departmentof human life. So far as we have ob-served them, prosperity and happinesshave been the results. Whateverdifficulties we may have to contendwith to-day are due, if not wholly, atleast in great part, to our disregard ofthem. Is not this the experience andtestimony of all the faithful Saintswho have watched the progress ofevents among us? Had we observedthese counsels, how many of the evilsfrom which we now suffer wouldnever have been known among us.Our neglect of them has brought itspunishment, and the faithful can seeit. But shall we not profit by the ex-perience of the past and act more wise-ly in the future? As the Lord has said(Doctrine and Covenants, sec. 90, ver.36[ ]37). But verily I say unto you, that I, theLord, will contend with Zion, and pleadwith her strong ones, and chasten her untilshe overcomes and is clean before me: Forshe shall not be removed out of her place,I, the Lord, have spoken it. We should begin to understand thatGod's ways are infinitely superior toour ways, and that His counsels,though they may seem to call forsacrifice, are always the best and thesafest for us to adopt and carry out.Thousands among us can testify to thetruth of this from individual experi-ence. These thousands should com-bine and create a public opinion in fa-vor of obedience to the counsel ofheaven that will have its proper effectupon our children and the inexperi-enced among us.THE GLORY WILL BE THE LORD'S.We also should learn this greattruth, that God will have all the gloryand honor for the establishment ofHis Church and Kingdom on theearth. Man cannot claim it in this orany other age of the world. Nothingbut the power of God could havebrought forth the fullness of the Gos-pel, organized the Church, gatheredHis people to Zion in fulfillment ofrevelation and performed the workwhich has been accomplished. There-fore, as Latter-day Saints, we areobliged to acknowledge the hand ofGod in all the blessings we enjoy.THE CONDUCT OF OUR LIVES.It should be the aim of all the mem-bers of the Church to carry out prac-tically in their lives the principles ofthe Gospel. In no way can we betterconvince the world of their truth thanin showing in our acts and dealingswith one another and withmankind the elevating effect theyhave upon us. We make high profes-sions, and there should be such a highstandard of purity of life among us asto correspond with these professions.Our children should be impressed withthis, and be taught that the name ofSaint is so holy that they only whoare pure in heart can claim it.If our religion does not lead us tolove our God and our fellow man andto deal justly and uprightly with allmen, then our profession of it is vain.The Apostle says: If a man say, I love God, and hateth hisbrother, he is a liar: for he that loveth nothis brother, whom he hath seen, how can helove God whom he hath not seen? We can best exemplify our love forour God by living our religion. It isvain to profess a love for God whilespeaking evil of or doing wrong to Hischildren. The sacred covenants wehave made with Him strictly imposeupon us the duties we owe to oneanother; and the great office of religionis to teach us how to perform thoseduties so as to produce the greatesthappiness for ourselves and for ourfellow-beings. When the obligationsof our religion are observed, no wordsare spoken or acts are committed thatwould injure a neighbor. If the Lat-ter-day Saints lived as they should do,and as their religion teachesthem to do, there would beno feeling in any breast butthat of brotherly and sisterly affectionand love. Backbiting and evil-speak-ing would have no existence amongus; but peace and love and good willwould reign in all our hearts and hab-itations and settlements. We wouldbe the happiest people on the face ofthe earth, and the blessing, and peaceof Heaven would rest upon us andupon all that belongs to us.If there be unhappiness and heart-burnings and quarrelings and hatredsamong us, they exist because we donot observe the religion which we pro-fess. They are not its fruits. Wherethese evils exist there is a crying ne-cessity for repentance. If any feel in-jured by the words or acts of theirbrethren or sisters, the Gospel pointsout and furnishes the way by whichthis injury may be repaired. Insteadof talking about this to others theyshould go to the person or personswho have done the wrong and maketheir feelings known. If satisfactionis then made, that ought to end thematter; but if not, it can be reportedto the proper officers of the Church forthem to take the necessary steps toterminate the difficulties. In this wayanimosities and disunion can be pre-vented and confidence be maintained.PARTAKING OF THE SACRAMENT.As Latter-day Saints, it is our gen-eral custom to partake of thesacrament once a week. Ifthe teachings of our Lord,in remembrance of whom we observethis sacred ordinance, be regarded, noone who has trespassed can be per-mitted to share in it until he has madereconciliation. It is the express com-mandment of the Lord Jesus that noone shall be permitted to partake ofHis flesh and blood unworthily. Amore perfect system to prevent theexistence of improper feelings andwrongs, among brethren and sisterscan not be imagined. If the Saints dotheir duty, difficulties do not remainunsettled beyond the Lord's day whenthey assemble to eat and drink in re-membrance of Him.TEMPLE WORK.Notwithstanding the difficulties thatthe Saints have had to contend with oflate, they have pursued their labors inevery direction with unabated zeal.This is particularly noticable in theirattendance at the Temples. The wishto avail themselves of the opportuni-ties for attending to the ordinances forthemselves and their deceased friendshas, if anything, increased, and thoseemployed in these sacred buildingshave their time fully occupied in per-forming their duties there. It is evi-dent that the Latter-day Saints ap-preciate the blessings to be obtainedthrough this Temple work. When wereflect that we have two buildings ofthis character already completed,furnishing abundant facilities forall who choose to go there toobtain the ordinances of God'shouse for themselves and forthose in whose salvation they takeso deep an interest, and that we haveanother Temple at Manti nearing com-pletion, and one in Salt Lake City,which we hope to see finished beforelong, our hearts are filled with glad-ness and we cannot refrain from prais-ing our God for His goodness unto Hispeople in permitting them, notwith-standing the oppositions and many dif-ficulties they have had to contendwith, to erect such structures and todedicate them, according to the pat-tern He has given for these sacreduses.No right feeling Latter-day Saintcan think upon this subject withoutbeing thrilled with heavenly joy forwhat God has done for us in our gener-ation, furnishing us, as He has done,with every facility to prepare us, ourposterity and our ancestors for thateternal world which lies beyond thepresent life. The Latter-day Saintsare, in truth, a highly favored people,and praise to God should ascend fromevery heart and habitation in our landfor the great mercy and goodnesswhich He has shown unto us. He hasmade us promises of the most preciouscharacter, and he has fulfilled them upto the present time. We would be themost ungrateful and unworthy peoplethat ever lived if, after receiving suchwonderful manifestations of His good-ness, we slackened in our diligence ornailed in our obedience and devotionto Him and His great cause.FOREIGN MISSIONS.The treatment which the Elders havereceived in preaching the Gospelthroughout the Southern States, aswe are informed by President JohnMorgan, has been much better of latethan it has been at some other periods.The Elders are listened to with morepatience and do not meet with so muchof the spirit of mobocracy and un-reasoning hate. Additions are beingmade to the Church, and those whoemigrate from that region have gener-ally settled in San Luis Valley, Colo-rado.The Elders in the North WesternStates under the direction of PresidentW. M. Palmer, pursue their laborswith undiminished zeal and with mod-erate success in bringing people intothe Church. These fields of laborhave furnished opportunities for num-bers of our young men to gain experi-ence in missionary efforts, and thosewho have this privilege return home,in the most of instances, better quali-fied to assist the local authoritieswhere they reside in the labors of theministry.In Great Britain the Elders meetwith considerable opposition in places,principally, however, from apostates.They find that field a much more dif-ficult one than it was in former years.The hearts of the people seem to havebecome hardened, and great indiffer-ence prevails in regard to religion.Still we learn from President GeorgeTeasdale, who presides at the presenttime over the European Mission, thatthe Elders who zealously enter intothe labors of the ministry and abund-ant cause for rejoicing in the successwhich attends their exertions.Throughout the Swiss and GermanMission presided over by Elder Fred-erick Schoenfeld, and the Scandina-vian Mission presided over by Elder N.C. Flygare, the Elders are laboringalso with commendable zeal and withgratifying results. An effort is beingmade at the present time to preach theGospel in Turkey, where Elders JacobSpori, J. M. Tanner and F. F. Hintzehave been, and are laboring, and eventhe land of Palestine has been visited,and in the late company of emigrantswhich reached this City from Europe,nine persons were gathered who hadreceived the Gospel in thatland, a land hallowed tous as the earthly home ofour Redeemer, and the soil of whichhis sacred feet trod.On the Sandwich Islands the Eldersare laboring faithfully under the direc-tion of President William King, andeverything is being done to improvethe condition of that people and tosave them from the destruction whichthreatens the extinction of the race.The plantation at Lale is still main-tained, and the Elders who have la-bored and who are still laboring thereenter with spirit into the managementof that property in a way to benefit asmuch as possible the native Saints.The attention of the Elders there is di-rected at present to the NavigatorIslands, where some few years agotwo native Elders from the SandwichIslands were successful in baptizing alarge number of natives and organizingthem into branches. These Islandshave not been visited by any of thewhite Elders, but it is probably thatsome of our Elders on the SandwichIslands may in the near future make avisit there.The letters which we receivefrom New Zealand where Presi-dent William Paxman presides,continue to bring us gratifying intelli-gence concerning the condition andprogress of the work there. TheElders are very successful among theMaories. Many of the white brethrenhave succeeded in acquiring the lan-guage of that race, which is cognate tothat of the Sandwich Islands, and two ofthem, Elders Ezra T. Richards andSondra Sanders, Jr. are now en-gaged, we are informed, in translatingthe Book of Mormon into the Maorilanguage. In Australia the Elders arealso laboring, but it is a much harderfield than among the natives of NewZealand.HOME MANUFACTURES.Frequent reference has been made inpast teachings and in former Epistlesto the subject of home manufactures.It has been, and we feel it still oughtto be, a theme of inexhaustible inter-est to Zion; yet there remains an im-mense amount to be done in develop-ing our resources and furnishing facil-ities for the employment of the people.It is pleasing to note the progresswhich is being made in some direc-tions. Our woolen manufactures aregaining credit for their excellence inother communities as well as our own.But we export considerable wool evenafter all our factories are well sup-plied. If this could be manufacturedat home, it would add greatly to thewealth of our community, not only inthe profits which would accrue from theuse of machinery, but in the employ-ment which it would furnish to manyof our citizens. Besides the manufac-ture of woolen clothes, there is con-siderable home-made hosiery of excel-lent quality which is placed on themarket.The range of articles which aremanufactured in this Territory isgradually increasing; and from thefeeling which now prevails we judgethat many more branches will soon beadded to those already in operation.The manufacture of soaps of variousgrades has now become a settled andpaying business. A fine quality of hatsis also made. Boots and shoes andclothing, glass, white lead, leadpipe, native paints, brushes,paper, printing type, starch,pearl barley and oatmeal are all manu-factured in the Territory, and many o[f]these articles in sufficient quantitiesto supply the local demand and to ex-port to some extent. It is an encour-aging feature in the most of these en-terprises that those engaged in themare seeking to enlarge their facilitieswith the view to increase their produc-tion. We have a large number ofchildren growing up among us whoshould be furnished with opportuni-ties to acquire skill to mechanism,manufactures, and other pursuitswhich are necessary for the comfortof man. It is not only incumbent uponparents to seek for avenues of prof-itable employment for their children,but it should be kept in view by theleading men of the Church in all oursettlements. An idle man's brain, itis said, is the devil's workshop, andno community can propser and main-tain a high standard of morality thatdoes not furnish employment for itsmembers. Far better to work for lowwages than not to work at all. Butwith proper care, and by putting inuse the experience that many individ-uals in every settlement possess, thereneed be no want of remunerative em-ployment for the rising generation,and for others who may come in fromabroad. It may not always be keptin mind, yet it is a fact, that any per-centage of idle persons in a commu-nity is a direct loss to the whole.It is unfortunate, also, for acommunity, when the youngand enterprising are compelledto leave it and go elsewhere to findemployment or room for the exerciseof the talent of which they feel them-selves possessed. Settlements thatare in this situation will languish andgo to decay, while others that furnishfacilities for employment will becomethrifty and prosperous. The combi-nation of capital by means of co-op-eration would, in many instances, en-able settlements to start branches ofmanufacture and conduct them suc-cessfully. Chimerical schemes, how-ever, should not be encouraged, astheir failure destroys confidence andmakes it more difficult to obtain aidfor worthy enterprises which might bemade successful. Where co-opera-tion has failed among us, it has notbeen because the principle is defect-ive, but because of mismanagement,sometimes from ignorance and care-lessness, and sometimes, perhaps, fromselfishness.Our country abounds in useful ele-ments. We have a fertile soil, whenproperly cultivated, and an admirableclimate. Grains, fruits, and vegeta-bles, as well as all kinds of stock, canbe raised here, and as superior inquality as can be found anywhere onthe earth. Care should be taken toraise the very best varieties. Ourhorses, cattle, sheep, and poultry, aswell as our grains, and fruits, andvegetables, should be of the verybest kinds, and no pains should bespared to keep them pure. Our sys-tem of irrigation does not admitof the cultivation of large areas ofland. Our farms are moderate in ex-tent. This being the case, they shouldbe cultivated in the most approvedstyle, and the whole business con-nected in a manner to bring the bestresults. As facilities for educationincrease, there undoubtedly will be amarked improvement in the manage-ment of all these branches of busi-ness.PRACTICAL EDUCATION.It is gratifying to notice the interestthat is being taken among us in educa-tion; yet there is great room for im-provement. As the taste for what maybe called book-learning increases,manual labor should not be neglected.The education of the mind and theeducation of the body should go handin hand. A skillful brain should bejoined with a skillful hand. Manuallabor should be dignified among usand always be made honorable. Thetendency, which is too common inthese days, for young men to get asmattering of education and thenthink themselves unsuited formechanical or other laborious pur-suits is one that should not be allowedto grow among us. Of course it isnecessary as society is now organized,that the professions, as they aretermed, should receive attention. Butevery one should make it a matter ofpride to be a producer, and not aconsumer alone. Our children shouldbe taught to sustain themselves bytheir own industry and skill, and notonly to do this, but to help sustainothers, and that to do this by honesttoil is one of the most honorablemeans which God has furnished to hischildren here on the earth. The sub-ject of the proper education of theyouth of Zion is one of the greatestimportance.President Brigham Young during hislifetime established schools in Provoand Logan, where the principles of theGospel have been taught in connectionwith the other branches of education, andmore recently similar schools havebeen commenced, and conducted withmarked success; in Salt Lake, Beaverand Fillmore Cities.The good results arising from teach-ings received in the Provo and LoganAcademies are very apparent andpleasing to all who have the interestsof the young at heart, and we regretthat such institutions are so limited innumber.Through the indefatigable labors ofProfessors Karl G. Maeser, J. Z. Stew-art and their associates, these schoolshave done, and are now doing, a greatwork in educational advancement, byinstilling a knowledge of the princi-ples of the Gospel of life and salva-tion into the minds of our children,upon whose shoulders the Kingdom ofGod must rest in the near future.We trust it will not be long beforeschools of this kind will be establishedin every city and village where theLatter-day Saints reside. In themeantime, however, the Saints shouldnot fail to avail themselves of theprivileges that are now offered them inthe Provo, Logan, Beaver, Fillmore,and Salt Lake Academies.THE  CHURCH SUITS. Congress at its last session as youare aware, passed a law entitled  AnAct to amend an Act entitled an Act toamend Section 5352 of the RevisedStatues of the United States, in refer-ence to bigamy, and for other pur-poses,  etc.Under the 15th and 17th sections ofthis law the Perpetual EmigratingFund Company and the Church ofJesus Christ of Latter-day Saints arerespectively declared dissolved, andin this Act it is made the duty of theAttorney General of the United Statesto cause proceedings to be taken in theSupreme Court of the Territory ofUtah to wind up the affairs of said as-sociations.Pursuant to the duty thus imposedupon the Attorney General, on the 30thday of July, 1887, proceedings were be-gun in said court by the United Statesagainst the Perpetual Emigrating FundCompany and its trustees, and theChurch of Jesus Christ of Latter-daySaints and its alleged trustees for the(Continued on Page 624.) 
 624 THE(Continued from page 617.)purpose of disposing of the property ofthe one and winding up the affairs of theother: asking in these suits to escheatto the United States large amountsof property alleged to be held by thesetwo defendants. At the time of thiswriting nothing has been done in thesecases further than to appear and an-swer these complaints. What the resultof these cases will be, we, of coursecannot now say. It is proper, how-ever, that we should speak upon thisimportant proceeding and let theSaints know how the cases stand.The Perpetual Emigrating FundCompany, as all of you well know,was conceived and organized for butone purpose, namely, to aid the poor ofour people in their humble efforts togather with their brethren. It hasbeen for this charitable purpose, theobject of the generous bounty of theLatter-day Saints, but at no time inits history has it owned any real es-tate, or any personal property, savesufficient for its absolute needs eachsucceeding year. The Church on theother hand has been the owner ofproperty, the gifts and bequests of anearnest, sincere people, made for thepurpose of aiding in the propacationof the Gospel of our SaviorJesus Christ. The effort now beingmade by our government to dissolveor wind up these associations andescheat their property, is the first ofthe kind in that history of our people,and is believed to be without histori-cal precedent in this country. Whenwe say we shall watch these cases withdeep interest, the Saints will readilybelieve that it is not alone for theproperty involved in these suits, butalso for the principles and rights thatare at stake.OUR SETTLEMENTS IN ARIZONA.The intelligence which reaches usfrom our settlements in Arizona is en-couraging; and we note with pleasurethat the people of the settlements atSt. Johns and Woodruff have conqueredsome of the difficulties with whichthey had to content, and which madetheir position very trying. Indeed,the news from all the Stakes there isgratifying.IN IDAHO.In Idaho, though our people paytaxes and support the schools, every-one of our faith is denied the privilegeof acting in the capacity of a schooltrustee or teacher, and no one withour belief can take the test oath thathas been prescribed by the Legislature.The situation of the people there isone that excites great sympathy. Theyare practically denied the rights ofAmerican citizens through the infa-mous test oath law which was enactedby the Legislature. It is very tryingto their patience and bears heavily up-on them. But the day must comewhen they will be relieved from theoperation of this infamous law.IN COLORADO.In San Luis Valley, Colorado, theefforts of our people to open and cul-tivate farms, and to surround them-selves with the necessaries and com-forts of life, are meeting with gratify-ing success. This is the more note-worthy because of the fact that thegreat bulk of settlers there havenot had experience in battling withthe difficulties that have to be met inthe building up of new settlements inan untried soil and climate. Like theSaints in Wyoming, those who residein Colorado have always received fairtreatment and encouragement andkind consideration from their neigh-bors and the officials of the State.IN MEXICO.Our settlements in Mexico are pro-gressing favorably and are graduallybeing strengthened, both at Diaz andJuarez. At the places named and inthe Sierra Madre Mountains near thelatter, we have nearly one hundredand fifty thousand acres [al[l grazing, timberand agricultural lands.The country is well adapted to stock-raising, as the grasses are of goodquality and great variety, while theclimate is uniform, the temperatureseldom reaching higher than 85 degreesor lower than an approach to thefreezing point. The facilities formaking comfortable homes there areexcellent, the land, water and timberbeing good. A fine steam saw, shingleand lath mill, and a planer andmoulder, are in operation, affordingbuilding material within easy reach ofJuarez.The treatment of our people by thenational and state officials in Mexicoand her citizens generally, has beencordial and hospitable. By word andact they have encouraged colonizationin the Republic. The settlements inChihuahua afford abundance of roomfor several hundred families and theycould live there in peace, and by ordin-ary habits of industry would soon makethemselves prosperous and happy.The Mexican Mission was opened in1870, and the Church now has quite alarge following of native Saints, mainlylocated in and about the national cap-ital. The Book of Mormon, Voice ofWarning, and numerous pamphletshave been published in the Spanishlanguage and are being distributed ac-cording to ancient predictions. Thusthe truth is being spread abroad amongthe seed of Israel through the meansof the record of their fathers, as wellas by the preaching of the Elders.THE ALBERTA COLONY.Recent letters from President CharlesO. Card, in charge of our colony inCanada, contain information of a grati-fying nature. The soil upon whichthey are located is said to be very pro-ductive, and the grain and vegetablesproduced are of excellent quality, andrange for stock is abundant and nutri-tious. The colony is preparing forwinter, and the families composing itwill soon have their houses completed.They have opened a fine vein of coalwithin three miles of their settlement,which is on Lees Creek, Alberta, Canada.The treatment accorded the Saintsthere, by officials and people, has beenconsiderate and kind, and the pros-pects for improvements and propserityare good. Brother Card would be gladto have any of the Saints, contemplat-ing a change of location, to join him,in that land, and we will gladly ap-prove efforts in that direction.CONCLUSION.We cannot refrain from expressingto you our own feelings of thankful-ness that we live in such an age, andthat God has bestowed upon us HisHoly Priesthood and has permitted usto take part in His great work. Weare thankful that we are associatedwith this people called Latter-daySaints; that we live in a day whenProphets and Apostles have been raisedup in the Church of Christ; and thatGod has stretched forth His hand tofulfil[l] His great and marvelous pur-poses which have been predicted bythe mouths of the holy prophets sincethe world began. We testify in thename of our Lord and Master, Jesus,that this is the great work of whichthe prophets have spoken, that God isthe founder of it, and that it will standforever, and accomplish all that hasbeen predicted concerning it. Zion isestablished and will be redeemed. Andit is our continual desire unto God thatHis people may be faithful in keepingHis commandments and doing Hiswill, so that they may be accountedworthy to stand, and their childrenafter them, and inherit the great bless-ings which He has to bestow uponthe faithful. The day is not far dis-tant when our Lord and Savior will berevealed from the heavens, and weshould live in a constant expectation ofthis great event, and seek, with all theenergy and power that we can exerciseand obtain, to prepare ourselves, ourhouseholds, and, as far as we have in-fluence, the inhabitants of the earth,for His glorious appealing.Your Brother,WILFORD WOODRUFF,In behalf of the Council of theTwelve Apostles.[line]FROM SATURDAY'S DAILY, OCTOBER 8.[line]Snow.A conference visitor in from Wyom-ing reports that it has snowed steadilyfor three days at Evanston and west ofthere to Weber Canon, winter havingthus unquestionably introduced itselfin that region for the season.

 Prest Woodruff addressed the Conference uponthe importance of the Latter Day Dispensation thegreatest that ever has ^been^ or ever will be committed toman on earth. 
 1 Prest Woodruff said that the Prophet Isaiahhad faithfully described the travels of this peoplefrom Jackson County and Nauvoo acrossthe Plains to these valleys and our settlements. Zion must spread abroad the Saints willagain take possession of their own and upon every site that has been dedicated for thatpurpose a temple will be built by the Latter day [Saint??] 
 Prest W Woodruff said if the Saintspaid their tithing punctually there would be noneed to call for means to build temples as therewould be an abundance for that purpose.The word of Wisdom is not obeyed as generally asit ought to be. Co Operation is a principletaught the saints as it is for their blessing. Thesesmall towns should not have more than one Co-Op Store. Don't pull apart and put up otherstores. He alluded to the scarcity of water andhow easily difficulties would arise among the brethren. Warned the saints against going to [law] 
 Prest Wilford Woodruff addressed the Conferenceon the necesity of living near to God and enjoying theSpirit of Revelations. Warned against taking advantageof one another. There are several temples in course oferection among the Latter Day Saints and he prophesiedthat they should be completed. 
 Prest Wilford Woodruff said we should beenergetic in getting as many names as possibleof our progenitors. 
 Prest W Woodruff said that the saints atKirtland built their Temple in their poverty. Geo.A. Smith hauled the first load of rock that hasbeen used in this generation for Temple f buildingRelated his early experience as a missionarySaid he spoke so much about temple building because he saw the necessity of this work. He had already had the ordinance of Baptism performed fortwo thousand of his family. 
 Prest W Woodruff read the prayer of theProphet Joseph while in Liberty jail. Said mostof those who took part in the persecutions inMissouri have been destroyed one way or anotherElias was promised to come before the great day ofthe Lord this refers more to the priesthood he heldthan to himself. This priesthood is now restored.Spoke upon the principle of baptism. 
 Prest. W. Woodruff spoke on the raisingof our children said a great responsibility restedupon the mothers, as the children were always withthem and would generally follow the mother'sexample, if the mother's were praying womenthe children would be praying children. 
 Prest. W. Woodruff spoke uponthe blessings which could be obtained in Templesboth for the living and the dead. He also spokeabout the misery which follows those who swervefrom the path of duty and degrade themselves with sin. 
 There were present on the stand Prest W. Woodruffwho addressed the conference on the kind providence of God in giving the Saints such abundant crops. 
 Prest. W. Woodruff said, if we could have the privi-lege of looking behind the veil, we would notneed any sermons on Temple building; we wouldbe so eager to rear them understanding the greatnecessity of this work, just think there are 50generations waiting for us to do the work for them. 
 W Woodruff was pleased to meet with thesaints and to hear how much they had done inregard to temple building. This was a peculiartrait belonging to the saints and not ex hibitedby any other people. Reviewed the Lords doingsin the different dispensations, showing that buta few was ever willing to obey God. 
 Prest. W. Woodruff compared this church to David who fought Goliath and like him we would come off victorious - 
 Prest W. Woodruff was pleased to see the saintsenjoy so many blessings. There is but one way of buildingup the Kingdom of God and that is by paying strictattention to the performance of our duties. 
 Prest. W. Woodruff said that the Lord had commencedthis work and he will see that it be victorious. 
 Prest. W W. Woodruff addressed the conferenceon our duty to be faithful in our covenantsand to be diligent in Temple building. TheSaints should not bear any feelings againstone another. God will overrule all for ourgood. 
 Prest W Woodruff said he had beenin the Church 50 years   related several incidentsof the conduct of the prophet Joseph   Borehis testimony that he was a true prophet. 
 Apostle Wilford Woodruff said he was pleasedto meet the Saints in conference. The Lord has sethis hand to gather Israel in fullfilment of prophecy, had been with the Church for fiftyyears, a little one has become an hundred and fiftythousand: The Lord has decreed he will raise upa righteous nation out of this people, yet we havea work to do, as the war between God and Satan willcontinue untill Christ comes. 
 Pres. Woodruff was much pleased to meet with the young peopleHe said they have a work before them that no other generation has ever had. Spoke of the responsibility that would in the near future rest upon the yong people, that they would have to bear of this Kingdom.  Singing and Benediction

Young sent me word to meet him at Snowflake as therewere some unsettled Sunset Matters.Now what on earth I have to do with them if there things unsettledconnected with that company I could not tell for the life of me, as yearssince I, as perhaps you will recollect, I turned over to receivers everydollar I had belonging to that Co. and positively declaired havinganything to do in the settlement of the business of the Company.But Bro. Snow instisted that I shold meet with the committee.I did so and they almost entirely ignored me in the business which wasmore pleasant to me than to have been a connected with it.I did know more about the business of the company than any personliving but NOW I positively know nothing and what I am trying to getat I want you to protect me so that I am moyed & perplexed tith thatdisagreeable matter, disagreeable to me because I am sure I was mostshamfully cheated in connection with it.Is this asking something something unjust or unfair? If so never takeany notice of tithis letter. I have had so much to annoy & Know no more thanI do. I am tired.There is another matter I want to speak to you about but will notnow.

 W. WoodruffJune 30 [18]80Salt Lake City, June 19, 1880.President Lot Smith, Sunset.Dear Brother I received yourletter of June 7, and was glad tohear from you, but sorry to learn thatyou had let that colt kick you in theface. That is a trick that I thoughtyou never allowed your horses to do,but I suppose he being a colt had not learn-ed the lesson. I hope it will not be alasting injury to you. I am gladto learn that you had a good conference.I should certainly have been glad tohave been with you. You speakof the spring crops, etc. It seemsto me that winter has just broken here.We are now having hot weather. Ithas been so cold that corn could notgrow. It stands just on topof the ground, but it is now begin- 
 ning to grow.All crops are back-ward, but we have plenty of water.I am glad to hear your stock is doingwell, and to learn of a good start on thetannery, and that it is doing well. Iwanted to know how that bark milldid. I think you had a goodoffer for the fifty heifers, $20 each, butperhaps they will do you as much good as the money. Has yourmare Mary got a horse colt? Give mylove to my Indian friends when theyask about me. J. W. Y. said hehad baptized Tenney Comiaga's son(I want to say right here that I spokeat Provo on my Indian visit, and thereporter published it in the Territorial En-quirer without my seeing it, and itwas a very incorrect report, represen-ting me as saying many thingswhich I did not say. It was abad, jumbled mess. I name it 
 here in case you should read it, for Ido not claim it as my report at all.)I am in hopes someday ofseeing Sunset and other settlementsin Arizona again. Willyou please inform me in your nextletter what those tithing orders arethat Jesse N. Smith has given onyou, for we do not know anything about them here in theSalt Lake office. I want toadvise you and all the settlementsin Arizona to make an annualreport of all tithing to the generaltithing office here, as other stakesdo, for it will remove all chanceof prejudice against those whoare living in the United Order.But we do not know where thosetithing orders are from, nor whohas given them, that you speakof. 
 I named what you wrote concerninganswering any calls that President Taylormight make on you, but he prefers altogetherfor you to make up your regular tithingaccount annually, and let that be sub-ject to his order and no more. I wasglad to learn that Foutz and Walker and J. W. Y.were getting settled all right. Rememberme kindly to Brother Neilson, and say to himthat I got his ferry stock account all right,which will enable me to give credit to whom due.It is a general time of health with us, withfew exceptions. Elder O. Pratt's health isstill quite delicate. We expect: Geo. Q. Cannon with us on Tuesday. I amalways glad to hear from you. Rememberme kindly to all in the fort. Please deli-ver the inclosed to whom directed, and obligeyour brother in the Gospel.W. Woodruff 
 Salt Lake City, Nov. 10", 1882.Dear Brother Lot.Your letter dated Dec 1" (you meant Nov. 1") arrived all safe and I was very glad to get it.I had not time to say all I thou-ght about the matter when I wrote;I did not say that I believed the reports that were written to Prest. Taylor, for I consider that I am somewhat acquainted with you and I have been satisfied a good while that many things have been said about Br. Lot Smith that are not true.  I was somewhat surprised at what you said about the Pitkins for they sent a letter to Prest. Taylor - I do not know that it was signed by the young man 
 [sideways text] April 12 [18]81W. Woodruff [end of sideways text]Salt Lake City, [page torn] [April 12] 1880.Pres. Lot Smith,Dear Brother,I received your first letter after you returned home. I was truly glad to hear from you, and that Jim.had got well. I have been so overwhelmed since I got home, with Conference meetings, councils, company day & night that I have hardly had time to look a wife in the face. I have had no time to write and have not now, only a few moments. I was appointed at the Conference the Supt of the Young Men's M. I. Assns for the Terry. & Moses Thatcher and Jos. F. Smith; Counselors. I went to Ogden on Saturday to attend the Stake Conference of the Young Men.I forwarded the Tithing Receipts for the money I broughtfrom Arizona. I sent back the Order of L. Hatch as they could not change it. I sent them back to you.I hope you got them. Half of Farmington and part of Salt Lake County enquired about you. Your wife from Farmington called upon me and wanted to know how you get along. I told them well. The apostles seemed to appreciate washat assistance you are rendering to the needy who want bread. I wish also to say in this connection that the mother of Joseph H. Wil-kins of St John, she lives in Ogden. He is one of the car-penters we took dinner with at St John. His mother has heardthat he had nothing to eat but black beans. She wanted to know if she could not deposit 25 or 30 bus. of wheat in the Tithg Office 
 but by the father stating as I said that he brought in a new wagon, worth (I think) $140 and got one of no use except for old iron etc. and that you held an iron rod over his head and made him sign a receipt, fully by force, before you would let him go.  I did not thinka man would put such a tale as that in writing without something to make it out of.  I do not wish you to send any statement of all your operations to Prest. Taylor since you have been in the order, not on my account for I do not think he would have time to read them for I think he has now more than he wants to attend to; but it is well for you to keep all evidence in your hands to meet any accusations that may ever be brought against you. 
 I am much pleased with your nar-rative of the Echo Canyon war, in the Contributor.  It is very interestingThis is about all I want to say at this time.  Give my love to your wives and children and all the men.women, & children in Sunset.You brother in the Gospel,W. Woodruff  
 and let him [page torn] in Arizona. I talked with Bp. Hunterabout it, and he said he would do it. But I did not know where he could get the wheat in Arizona, except it was of you.So I told her to deopposit some wheat in the office and I would send the order to you and I hope you will do what you can about it. I think you took a bucket of flour to him, when we went there. We had a good conference, a large assembly, and the Spirit of the Lord with us. I want you to give my love and blessings to all the inhabitants of Sunset not leaving out the sisters and chil-dren. I have not time now to write upon any thing much only on business and hardly that. I found my family all well & glad to see me, as I was them. Please say to Bro Pitkin, I recd his letter & will write him when I can get time. Give my love to Bro LakeBrigham City, St Joseph and all my friends who enquire. I judged from what I learned from your letter that you was not going to have much trouble on the timber question, which I am thank-ful for, I shall always be glad to hear from you.Your Brother in the Gospel W Woodruff 
 Private. I wish to say that the subject came up of our permitting the young people to be married by the Authorities of the Church in Arizona, without going to the Temple. And the Council all sustained it where they were so far from the Temple. And the remark was made, that it would seem neces-sary to establish a place for Endowments at some future time in Arizona so that young people could get legally married, without going so far. I got a telegram from J. W. Y. at Albu-querque was buying goods. I hope Bro Tenney will not mix any Mdse with the St John Purchase. And the Council wish all Co-op stores to be governed by the Presidency of the Stake. W

I have thought perhaps that I might visit St. George some time during the winter, to attend to some Church business.It is a general time of health with us, with few exceptions.C. C. Rich is gaining some.O. Pratt's health is quite poor-ly .My health is quite good. Igot on the scales the other day. I weighed 166 lbs., about 4 lbs. more than I ever weighed before.My first wife a week ago had twenty five 
 teeth drawn at one time, under the in-fluence of ether, which made her sick for 24 hours, and she has had a sore mouth ever since.We had the coldest November I ever saw.It is more mild this month.Geo. Q. Cannon is in Washington.I have not heard from him since he left.I was sorry to hear of the bad luck of Brigham CitySaints with their crops.Are they all leaving?Where does Brother Lake go?How much wheat did you have, and how much corn?Bishop Udall of St.John has been with us to get help to pay for that place. He supposed, from Brother Tenney's representation, that the purchase was made for the Church,that is, that the Trustee was made responsible for the payment. This was a wrong idea entirely. It was bought for the Latterday Saints to go there, take possession of the land,

Tenney who says it is quiet at present but the enemies are hold-ing secret meetings and planning mischief.I am sending a copy of the apportionment to Bp. Udall to Jesse N. Smith to be forwarded by 
 and pay for it, but it has got in such a fix that the trustee had has had to stretch out his hand to assist to save the place.He gave an order onthe Southern herds for some 275 cows.Brother Udall conveyed an idea that you told him that you had 100 cows held in reserve to help to pay for that place.Brother Udall said he had not received them, and the question arises, Where are they? I did not know whether there was any mis-understanding about it. We want him to have any Church tithing of any kind in Arizona, that he can make use of, until that place is secured and paid for.Again, Brother Taylor has put it upon me to have all the emigration of the Saints that go to Arizona, to go to St. John, until there is enough there to take the land and water and use it.Brother Udall said 
 private conveyance, so that he may know what we are doing.Prest. Taylor, Cannon, and several others start for the Iron works on Wednesday and the Presidency go on to St. George for a short visit.My kind love to all, Your Brother in the gospel,W. Woodruff 
 that he met nearly 100 wagons going to Arizona, but he knew nothing about them, nor where they were going to, and thought many of them were going on their own hook, perhaps to get off by themselves.But as most of the emi-gration will go by Sunset, I want to dele-gate you to say to them that the counsel of the Presidency and Twelve Apostles to them is to go direct to St. John and settle there under the direction of Bishop Udall until he says it is enough.There should be nearly 200 families settlethere.There should be men enough to make use of all the water during emigration time, or we shall constantly have outsiders squatting down and claiming waste water.We wish you to say to all emigration of the Saintswho wish to claim fellowship with us,that we want them to take our counsel in this matter and go to St. John, 
 instead of going everywhere else, untilthat place is settled, and if they will not do this they cannot have our fel-lowship.When St. John is settled,after it is done satisfactorily, they can make changes if they wish.We look upon the St. John country as being as good as any part of Arizona, and unless the Saints possess and control St. John, there is no Mormon settlement will have any peace in that territory.It seems rather strange to us, the manner in which the last election was controlled.Brother Tenney's representation to me was that the Barth's asked for none of the offices whatever, only for our people to vote for the county seat to remain at St. John. But, instead of this, in the election the Mormons lost every office in the county.When I think that they hold the legal 
 majority of votes in the county, I think our people will find hard work to live under the control of that class of men who have held control of Apache County.It seems as though there was a screw loose somewhere in that election.But I feel that we should never rest until we have full control of St. John and root out that nest that dwellsthere.If there is any tithing stock,grain or money in any part of Arizona that Brother Udall can use for the payment of this debt, we wish him to have it.My love to your family and all the Saints in Sunset, not forgetting the children.Your brother in the Gospel,W. Woodruff

Young andGrant's travels in Arizona. I havehad three short notes from them, butthey gave me no account of theirtravels. Br. Grant spoke of attendingthe funeral of your little son.I feel interested in the labor ofthe brethren among the Lamanites ofall that country. The Oribas andMoquies are very dull and super-stitious and hard of understandingcompared with the Navajoes, Zoonies,Lagooneies, and Islatos.

 SALT LAKE CITY, APRIL 18, 1884.Dear Brother,We presume that the statement of the number of families apportionedto be selected from your Stake to strengthen the settlement at St. John, Ari-zona, has been received by you and acted upon.We desire these brethren to proceed upon their journey as soon as theycan possibly make it convenient to do so.Some of those who are called may prefer to go by railroad, which ismuch more expeditious and expensive. We cannot say positively what the fare will be by rail, but perhaps not less than forty dollars for adults, chil-dren under ten years, half price. But all this business can be satisfactorily arranged in this city.We deem it more prudent, in the majority of cases, for the brethrento go across country with teams. True, by team it is a long and tediousjourney, but healthful and comparatively inexpensive. Then, when thebrethren arrive at their destination, they have their teams, wagons, harnessand many useful implements to begin to build up homes with and maketheir families comfortable.The proper route for teams will be up the Sevier river, over the dividevia Johnson to the Pahreah (formerly Lee's) Ferry, on the Big Coloradoriver, thence to Willow Springs, thence to Little Colorado river, up said rivervia Brigham City, Sunset, St. Joseph, Holbrook, Woodruff, Greer's Ranch, to St. John.Those who desire to go by railroad will travel by the Denver & RioGrande Railroad to Pueblo, thence by the Atchison, Topeka & Santa FeRailroad to Albuquerque, thence by the Atlantic & Pacific Railroad toNavajo Station, which lies about forty miles north of St. John. Completearrangements can be made for transportation by railroad, from this city toNavajo Station, thence by teams to St. John, by communicating with W. C.Spence, at President John Taylor's office, in this city.W. WoodruffChairman. 
 W. Woodruffhad any little difficulty, they wouldcome to me with their troubles. Ishould like to meet with all of themonce more.We have had a good conference;we set apart 107 missionaries theMonday following many of whomwere for the Southern States. Bro's. Ivensand Pratt are beginning to baptizea good many in Mexico. One ofErastus Snow's sons and Helaman Pratt are called to go there andassist in the work.We are looking for the Commission-ers to arrive at any time now, butthere is no excitement over them.We are having our March weatherin April -- it snows, rains & everyfew days.I understand that you havebeen East some where for bloodedbulls and stallions. What have yougot? How many sheet [sheep], horned stock &c 
 have you now? I What famalies haveyou with you? Do you still keepup a dairy at Pleasant Vally? Yourwill, of course is gone. How do youget your lumber?I am asking too many ques-tions but by visiting that country Ifeel interested in such questions.As everYour Brother in the Gospel,W. Woodruff

 Woodruff April21 [18]80Salt Lake City, April 21, 1880.President Lot Smith.Dear Brother I have a goodmany things I want to say to youwith my pen, but up to the presenthour I have found but very littletime. We have been in either coun-cils, conferences, or meetings, of somekind, ever since I came home. Iwrote to you on the 12th and sent the ti-thing receipts and a letter to J. W. Y.Since then I have received a letter fromJ. W. Y., saying they were buying goods atAlbuquerque for Young, Christofferson,and others. He also spoke about takinga contract on the railroad for our people.President Taylor and myself telegraphedback that the Co-op. stores should be underthe direction of the presidency of the stakesand those who furnish the money. 
 Salt Lake City, Mar. 23rd, 83.Bro. & Sister Lot Smith:I have just received your letter containing the painful news of the loss of your little son Wilford. I feel to deeply sympathize with you in your loss and by such a death. My oldest son, Wilford is 43 years to-day. When a child he dranklye which came very nearly killing him. His throat grew up so that he came verynear choking to death for years afterwards and has not got entirely over it yet. I have sometimes thought the name itself was rather unfortunate; still I do not think that a name 
 I also got a letter, directed to BrotherTaylor and W. Woodruff, saying thatBrother Tenney had sent an agentto borrow a hundred cows, to BrotherFlake, to make a payment thisspring on the St. John purchase.Brother Hatch wanted the council tofurnish Brother Murdock or bearer$1,000 for Brother Flake, and forBrother Flake to furnish that amountof barley to Brother Hatch for the people tosow and make bread of. But the coun-cil did not wish to do it. The coun-cil has decided that the presidents ofstakes and bishops furnish Brother A.M. Tenney, as a loan, what tithingstock they may have on hand to helppay the 100 cows this spring, and wewant to continue to pay for thatpurchase until it is settled for, butwe want the people who go there topay the debt, and not the church. 
 has anything to do with good or bad fortune. Truly the loss of children in that way is painfulbut there is one consolation in the matter you will have him again in the morning of the first resur-rection in your family organization, of the same age and size that you laid him away. I hopeyou may be comforted in your affliction. I would like to see you and your wives and children once more. Give my kind love to them all.I expect that little Lorenzo who used to help me about my break-fast is getting to be quite a boy. I should like to see all the children of the Sunset fortonce more.I understand that you went with Brothers Young and Grant 
 But we think it is necessary to helpabout it, so that we shall not losethe purchase. I thought there hadpeople enough gone there to raisethe 100 cows this spring. But wethink the church and the branchesin Arizona will be under the ne-cessity of helping about it, as aloan, until the place is secure.I have not had word from BrotherTenney since I left about St. John onthe mission.I found my family all well onmy arrival, and we were again gladto meet. We are having good times inour Conference meetings and councils.We are united in our councils and thespirit of the Lord is with us. Therewas a good deal of inquiry aboutyou at the conference by Farmingtonpeople and others. I hope to hearfrom you and know how all is 
 to the Seven Villages. I wish when you get time you would give me a little sketch of your visit among them how muchtime you spent with them, holding meetings, with what success &c &c.How did as fat a man as Brigham get up and down amongthem? I should be glad to hear any information concerning their visit with you. What are the pros-pects among the Lamanites and what is A. M. Tenny ^doing^? What is the prosperity in your settlement?Any thing of that kind would be of interest to me. Give my kind love to the people of the fort.Write when you can.Your Brother in the Gospel,W Woodruff 
 getting on in Sunset. I miss mysociety there very much, especiallythose dear children. I want to sendmy love and blessing to all sunset, men,women, and children. I inclosea letter to J. W. Y., which you willplease forward to him, for I do notknow where to find him. I alsoforward in this the order for 30 bushelsof wheat for Brother J. W. Watkins atSt. John. The brethren thought thatas he was a missionary they wouldlet him have as much wheat thereas his mother put in here. I didnot know but you would be close runon the wheat question, but whateveryou can do in that line will be ablessing to him. It is still verycold here. On the 17th we hadnearly a foot of snow. The mountains 
 are full of snow, and if we were tohave warm weather we would standa chance to have a heavy flood.I want to send in your lettera few lines to Bishop Lake, of Brig-ham City, which please send to him.Your brother in the Gospel,W WoodruffBrother Lot Smith I wouldrecommend that when you markyour lambs that you mark yourtithing lambs for the Church, andalso when you brand your calvesput the church brand on your tithingcalves, and that at the end of theyear you make a report of whattithing you have on hand, and 
 W. WoodruffSalt Lake City, Oct. 23, 1882.Elder Lot Smith.Dear Brother - I have felt a desire towrite to you for some time past. PresidentTaylor is receiving letters from persons who leaveyour fort and go to other places to settle.They complain bitterly of your treatmentof them in the settlement of their accounts.Among others, the Pitkins said that theirproperty was priced very low when takenin, and very high when taken out.They said they gave in a wagon worth$125, which was priced at $50, and gota wagon in return good for nothingbut old iron, and he was forced tosign a bill of receipt with an iron rodover his head, or something of thatkind. Now of course these stories are all on one side of the questionBut they have their effect against you,and I would like not to have anymore such stories come to the First Pres-idency, if possible to avoid it. 
 that this instruction be given to allthe branches in your stake.Brother Taylor says they get noreport of the tithing in Arizona,but I told him what had beenpaid on the ferry and the tithingmoney I brought. Please impartthis instruction to Brothers Lake,Richards, etc. 
 2Now I think that a man who has doneas much for Israel as you have in yourday, can afford to be generous with thosewho leave your settlement, and let them have as good as they bring toyou, inasmuch as they get no in-crease. There is hardly any manspeaks well of you, who leaves yoursettlement. They generally go awaydissatisfied. Brother Ira Hatchwas called by the authorities to go toSavoy, to assist Brother Titien. I haveNever heard of his saying anythingupon the subject. The quorumof the Twelve have been districtingUtah and the other territories on theIndian Mission question, but ithas been referred to the Presidency,and is now in their hands.We appointed you to stand at the headof the mission in Sunset Stake, andJesse N. Smith in Snowlake Stake, 
 3and if this thing is confirmed bythe Presidency, there may be someof the Twelve to visit all Arizona, NewMexico, etc., to assist in this organ-ization, as we shall want to gatherall the missionary strength we canin all those stakes. There is a great desire to make the Lamanitemission as effectual as possiblethroughout all the territories.President Taylor has received arevelation, in which George Teasdaleand Heber J. Grant were appointedto fill the vacancies in the Quorumof the Twelve Apostles, and SeymourB. Young and Abram H. Cannonwere appointed to fill the vacancies inthe quorum of the First Presidencyof the Seventies, all four of whomhave been ordained. We had agood Conference, strong preaching andstrong testimony. John T. Caine is 
 4the People's candidate for Congress, andVan Zile the ring candidate. Now,Brother Lot, I want you to write me a letter and tell me how manyfamilies you have got left with you.How your crops are this season. Howis the Indian question? What isthe prospect of labor among theNavajoes, Moquis, etc.? How isyour health, and how is your fami-ly? Give my love to them all.C.C. Rich was with us at Conference apart of one meeting. We anointedhim and blessed him.

 W. WoodruffSalt Lake City, Feb. 26th, 1884.Lot Smith.Dear Brother.I received your letter of Feb. 18th and I was glad to hear from you as I always am. I was sorry to have thatinteresting letter get drown-d and the money too, but it was better forthat to be lost than forthe man, at least if he was worth more than a hundred dollars and heought to be.I would be glad tovisit you again and tovisit your settlements, butI do not know when it will be. I would liketo visit your new settle- 
 ments at least the onein the mountains. I wouldlike to know what youare doing with Sunsetare you occupying theplace now; is it yourpost office? I see that youdate your letter there. TheMoquis are an innocentpeople but I think quitesuperstitious in some things. There seems to be quitean opening among the Maricopas and Pimas the leading men are receiv-ing the work and I thinkthe tribes will follow. Theyhad quite a difficultyof late with Crismonand his boys. I think his boys are hard cases. they take up Indian stock put them in the pen andcharge $1 a head and the Indians put someof Crismon's cattle in thepen and charge 50  each 
 and the Crismon boys undertook to take them byforce and threatened theirlives and there would havebeen a fight and the Cris-mon family wiped out if it had not been for Hinck-ley, Ray and Hawks, our missionaries who stoppedthe Crismon boys comingout on the ground to fight; that family hasmade a good deal oftrouble with Lamanites andMormons. Br. Young is visiting in California;I expect him home soon. Br. Thatcher has retur-ned from Washington andBr. Cannon is on hisway home which leavesBr. Caine alone. I donot know what Cong-ress will do but they aregetting wicked enough to do anything.It is a general time 
 Salt Lake City,Jan. 27, 1881.Lot Smith,Dear Brother; I recieved your letter of Dec. 28, 1880. I have not been able to answer it before.I am very sorry for your accident and hope you will recover from it, and that you may not be permen^an^tly lame. I do not hear a word from E. Snow or B. Young; in fact, do not know where they are or what they are doing, but suppose they are some-where in Arizona.We learned that Bishop Udell has crossed the Lees Ferry with all his stock, all well. I hope he will have good luck in getting them to St. John in safety.I see the editors of the "Dem-ocrat" seems to have a key to get knowledge. I know nothing of the 
 of health with us. I am somewhat troubled with acold at present which is a common complaintin this country at present. Br. Fowler who was labor-ing in the Tithing Office,died rather suddenly; webury him tomorrow. We are having pleasantweather overhead but ourstreets are very muddy.Our Legislators are grin-ding away the best theycan, but I do not know what they will accomplish.I spent the most of De-cember in St. George Tem-ple and had a good time and a good con-ference. I wish you wouldtell me by letter how manyyou have with you and 
 elections only from Brother Tenny.I am glad you are so fruitful.I hope your posterity will honor both God and their parents.I think the Navajoes were suc-cessful on their hunt.I hope Mary's boys will prosper as well as the rest.Remember me kindly to all your family and all in the Fort.We got a letter from George Q. Cannon.He feels well and is boyant in spirit.Says God reigns, and is thoroughly con-vinced that Gov. Murry has hurt him-self and his party much more than George Q and the Saints.The Apostles are all well ex-cept O. Pratt and C. C. Rich. The lat-ter is gaining very slowly, and O. Prattis quite poorly: mostly confined to his bed and room is quite weak. But we hope for the best.

You didnot say that you had received it. Istated plainly in that letter in a privatenote that I did not believe the reports givenabout you. It is true, you cannot hin-der people talking, any more than I canand I do not care what people say againstone, if they do not tell the truth. I couldtell my enemies a great many failings Ihave that they do not know anything about,but I do not feel disposed to tell them. Theymay lie about me as much as they please,and I suppose they will do the same by you.I probably did not explain myself clearlywhen I said that I did not want anymoreof the stories to come to Brother Taylor.

 Salt Lake City, Dec 7th, 1882.Lot Smith.Dear Brother:Your letter of Nov. 28th, is before me, and I feel to say a little more upon the subject before us. I wrote to you on Nov. 28th which of course you had not received whenyou wrote last.I will here explain what I meant in speaking of Prest. Taylors' not having time to read such accounts as you spoke of. Of course he could ^read^ a letter, but if you sent a history of every man that has been with you in that order,what he brought in, and what he took out, it would be a document as large as the New Testament, and 
 nan 
 unless you were on trial for these things it would not be necessary.I received a very interesting letter yesterday from Br. Christian Lingo Chris-tensen upon the Indian question. The administration to that lame Indian was very interesting. The time has come when we are commanded to turn unto them and it is beginning to be a day of God's power among them, and it is our duty now to go among them.I have felt to volunteer to go among them in Arizona and labor with them; but Br. Taylor rather claimed the right to distribute us. So he sends B. Young and H. J. Grant to Arizona & New Mexico.They will start about Jan. 6th, [18]83 and visit you and will look to you and Jesse N. to assist in their labors among them. E. Snow and M. Thatcher are now in Mexico, I suppose. F. M. Lyman goes 
 nan 
 through the Uintah reservation, G. Teasdale to the Indian Territory, Cherokees, &c. L. Snow & F. D. Richards attend to the northern tribes. I shall give my views to Br.Brigham about his labor with you and the brethren in that territory.Concerning Br. Charles W. Stayner, he has been getting a code of revelations as big as the New Testament, and he, himself was to be the great coming man. Arthur Stayner at first said it was all from the devil; if he had stuck to it, it would have been well, but he finally fell in with and believed them. Chas. W. has been brought before a High Council and finally confessed they were not of God, asked forgivenessand has been forgiven; now, if he gives them up, all will be well with him.Prest. Taylor requires me to tarry in this country and not go into the 
 nan 
 W. WoodruffIndian field. He thinks I am most too old and then I have the Historian's Office on my hands and a great dealof correspondence concerning the templesand other matters, and he wants me to attend the conferences in this country.Br. Taylor and myself with those of the Twelve who are here are now travelling two-thirds of the time. We have justbeen through Sanpete, Juab, and Utah counties. We start in the morning for the north.Manti Temple is ready to turn thearches over the upper story windows, andLogan Temple will be ready for dedi-cation by next Sept.  it might be by April if they had means enough. Weare in hopes that the Salt Lake Tem- 
 ple will be up to the square next fall.From what I learn I suppose a part of the county offices in the late election fell into the Mormons.I and my family are as well as usual; the Presidency and Twelve are also well. L. John Nuttall is around his house again. Elias Smith is stillvery bad, being confined to his bed, and in great pain most of the time. In his fall, he feel upon his lame side and paralyzed his right leg; and it looks as though it would be months before he can walk again if he can at all. Capt. Hooper came near dying of late. Br. Van Cott is very low with brights disease. Br. Peck is able to be 
 out again.Prest. Arthur thinks there has been en-ough legislation at present for the Mor-mons. But Gov. Murry thinks differently, and Murry may attempt to appoint another Prest.

 Salt Lake City, Utah.Nov. 8th, 1883.Lot Smith.Dear Brother.Your very kind letter of Nov. 1st arrived all safeand I read a portion of it in Council yesterday (I left out that portion concerning my interest in humanity as my company might have differed from you in that sentiment I would not read it to them). All were much pleased with your account of the Indians. Br. Teas-dale has returned from the Cherokee Nation; he has labored hard for six months and not 
 baptized a soul. Brs. Daulton and felt are still there but find it an up-hill business. I would rather go among the wild Indi-ans to convert them to the gospelthan among those who are so much Christianized and priest rid-den.I was glad you agreed with me about your family here.  I understand they were calculating to go back, I have not seen them since.I suppose that Brs. Young and Grant are some where in your country you will probobly see them.We buried Brs. Lewis Robison and Israel Barlow; we have buried a good many aged people during the present year.We attended Logan Conference 
 on Saturday and Sunday. Wewent all through the Temple and expect to see it ready for dedi-cation by March. The roof of the Manti Temple will soon be finished. Salt Lake Temple is up to the square there will be a few more rocks laid before it is put aside for the winter.Brs. Cannon, Richard, and Caine are at Washington looking after the business of Zion.Remember me kindly to your family and my friends with you.Your Brother in the Gospel,W. Woodruff
