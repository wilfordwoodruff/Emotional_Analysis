Many also have been slain by pest- ilence there has also been great destruction of property  by fire &amp; otherwise. The spirit of Disunion seems to incr- ease among the people. There has been a great want of Bread in France during the past year caused in a great measure by closing up the southern ports which has stoped  the importation of cotton. France has opened a war with  Mexico and there is a great lack of confidence through- out the Earth betwen man &amp; man and between all the Nations  of the Earth, there are many widows and orphans and  much morning &amp; Lamentation through the Land in conseq- uence of the much blood which has been shed during the past  year but the End is not yet, but ownly Just commenced peace  is taken from the Earth and the wicked are inspired to  slay the wicked. While these things are going on the Saints  are gathering home to Zion to build up the kingdom of God, then  the Lord may reign over his Saints while Satan rules over his own Dominion.

He referd  to different Asstronemers who had in ages past marked  upon there maps the starry heavens &amp; many of those fixed  stars had since been removed, &amp; could not be seen &amp; he  believed that when this Earth was consumed by fire &amp; reorga- nized &amp; became celestial that it could not be seen by the inhabitants of any planet in our solar system, or by any  Except a celestial body. The Zion of God must be a vast  body if it contained a Zion from all the creations which  God had made. Many remarks were made by professor Pratt and He carried our minds so far from Home it took me till midnight to get back   ENDENTRY January 12, 1863    I spent the day at home.

A Joint committee was app- inted to wait upon Govornor Brigham Young &amp; informed him that the Assembly was organized &amp; ready for any communication he might wish to make. Governor Young accompanied the committee to the State House &amp;  Message (see Printed Message) 2000 copies of the message was ordered to be printed &amp; it was also to be printed in the Deserett News Govornor Young then addressed the assembly He said I wish to say a few words. Many may not be able to tell why we are in this capacity. I do not think that you see this thing as it is. Our organization will be kept up. We may not do much at present in this capacity yet what we have don or shall do will have its Effect. Our constitution which we sent to Washington has been closely scanned by the members of Congress all of our moves here are feared by the nations of the Earth Esspecially the United States. This body of men will give laws to the Nations of the Earth. We meet here in our seconed annual Legislature &amp; I do not care whether you pass any laws this season or not But I do not wish you to loose one inch of ground you   ENDENTRY Jan 19 1863 have gained in your Organization but hold fast to it for this is the kingdom of God and we are the friends of God and you will find that much will grow out of this organiza- tion But I will say without the inspirations &amp; revelations of God our acts are of no use. We are called the State Legislature but when the time comes we shall be called the kingdom of God Our Government is going to peaces and it will be like water that is spilt upon the ground that cannot be gathered if we do not take care of ourselves no one will take care of us We are the best of any people on the Earth, and there is no people as well off as this people on the Earth for light &amp; the knowledge of God. In 1857 we said to 7000 troops stop and they stoped had there been but 500 like these troops here we should have let them come in for they would not have done any harm it is our business to take care of ourselves if we see the Enemy coming it is our duty to prepare for it. I can do better to never trade again in my life with a wicked man. I will name one thing. I built a theatre here myself. some wanted the Armey to come here I do not, and since the Armey got up a Theatre for themselves we have been crouded to the full. I will be richer in the End if the wicked do not come nigh. I do not care whether you sit one day or not. but I do not want you to loose any part of this Government which you have organized, for the time will come when these men will give laws to the Nations of the Earth Nauvoo and He said if we done our duty we should prevail over all our Enemies. we should get all things ready &amp; when the time comes we should let the water onto the wheel and start the machine in Motion    well what Joseph Smith said upon the organization of this kingdom. He said if we done what was right we should be sustained by the Holy Ghost. we have to go step by step. The words of the prophet will be fulfilled upon the Earth and many of us will live to see the kingdom of God   ENDENTRY
