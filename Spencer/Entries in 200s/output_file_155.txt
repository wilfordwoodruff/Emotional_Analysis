Smith buried a child to day it  snowed and rained through most of the day   The following is a synopsis of Presidents Youngs remarks on the  30, at the Funeral of sister Ivins   "On such occasions as this I can say that I have many reflection we are subject to pain, sickness and death yet we cling to life. when a   ENDENTRY 1863   Person dies all we can do for them is to bury them decently we cannot   preach to the Dead. It is right that we should cling to life that we  may live to do our Duty, to build up the kingdom of God but we should  not cling to the world or to set our hearts upon the things of the world  we should live Every day so that we should be satisfied with our- selves at night it will be an Evidence that the Lord is satisfied  with us we should seek to do our duty day by day. Brother Joseph  in his remarks said that He wished we had the faith we once had. I  see the laid  hands with me yesterday upon one of my wives who was vary  sick and it seemed as though she could not live an hour and she was  healed right up and thousands of the saints who are now alive  would now have been in there graves if it had not been for  the Exercise of faith in the midst of the saints. we have in our  bodies the seeds of Death and our secret Enemy takes every advantage  He can to destroy our lives from off the Earth. many of the children  are taken away As to Sister Ivins she Appeared to be ripe  she was in years. Whare has she gone she is in Paradise, in the  world of spirits whare is it, It is in this world and on this Earth  I do not think sister Ivins is far off she may be in this room  we have not to go out of this room to find the Lord, He is in all  places by his influence. I told Brother Orson Pratt when He said  there was Empty space if he would show me where it was I would  show him one place where the Lord was not. All men will  have to pass through the ordeal of Death. Jesus Christ went through  the same and all men will have to go through the same. Our bodies go  to the dust where they will lie untill they are raised up clothed  with Immortality we shall meet Sister Ivins in the Resurrection she has been kindly treated by her children and all the family  and I feel to Bless them for it I have never met with Sister Ivins  but what she manifested a good kind contented spirit, we  all want to be prepared for that which is to come, we should Exercise  faith for the devils wicked men and Nations and all Hell are triying to  destroy the Latter Day Saints and the Kingdom of God. We have the seeds  of death within us and the devils take the advantage of us and try to destroy  us in our weakness. I would rather have the faith of the gospel than   ENDENTRY 1863   the gold of the world. I know the feelings of the people, they might have the  Loright of the Lord but they are seeking for gold and will not do as they should I know the feelings of the people where they are Justified before the Lord and where  they are not, we have to bear with them chastize them, then comfort  them andc, and do the Best we can with them I know the standing of this  people before the Lord all the time I do not say much to them.

He still feels sure that He will not die. he thinks  that he has the testimony of the spirit of the Lord, that He will  live and not die. He said that he was innocent of many things that the people thought he was guilty off He said that he had  never killed any person or had any hand in the death of any  person except Bunting and said that he could not  fell that he was guilty of murder in the death of Either of them He had killed them in self defence He said Wm Hickman  had advised him to do many things that made his flesh  crallwl but he had not followed Hickmans advise in these things  He told the Jailors (which I did not Hear) that Hickman  once asked him to go and knock an old man in the Head  for no other purpose ownly to obtain an old mare that was not worth more than $30. And He feels that Wm Hickman  has betrayed him and done him much injury and he looks upon Hickman as a vary bad man. He said he would like to see me tomorrow. He thought to day was the time appointed for his Execution untill I told him it was tomorrow. I went  to the council and spent the afternoon and attended to the business  of the day And in the Evening I again called upon Jason Luce in company with R. Burton and  many others. G. D. Watt being present acted as reportinger in  taking an account of what Jason Luce would reveal unto us in  his last moments. I called upon Governor Reed and asked  him if he would commute Jason Luce sentence to the Penet- entiary foor m life as Hickman had held out this promise to Luce. Soon Hickman and Wilford Luce came in for their  answer and Mr Reed told them He could do nothing in the premises that He considered that He would be commiting crime to change the sentence of Luce unless he had better  ground than any thing He had seen. So when I arived  at the prision in the Evening I told Jason Luce there was  no chance for him to live and I wished him to prepare to die. He then spent more than an hour giving us an accunt of what   ENDENTRY Jan 11, 1864   He had done and what he knew. He said in the case of Drown and Arnold that Hickman was responsible for their death. He killed them with the help of one or two others. He said Wm A Hickman robed Carpenter's store took the goods in his waggon and carried them to Huntingtons and from Huntingtons to his house over Jordon  and then told Furguson if he would kill Carpenter He would  clear him that He should not lyie in Jail one day Furguson killed  Carpenter and was Hung for it and Hickman made him believe that he would be liberated up to the last minute. Luce said that  Hickman Murdered blank for no other purpose  ownly to obtain his gold watch and money and thinks he has the watch  yet. He said that Hickman was at the head of a Band of thieves  they have stolen as high as 100 Head of cattle at a time from Camp Floyd and gone ount onto the prairie and divided them and taken  them to different parts of the Territory. Luce also said that Hickman had many men around him that Had to be fed and that  men under him would go onto the range and drive up a Beef and kill and Eat it and sell the Hides or make them into Larretts  or throw them away as the case might be without any regard  to whom might be the owners. Luce said that Hickman had been his ruin and the ruin of others and in all thes things He had carried his point by declairing that President Brigham Young hagd given him council to do all these things (which  is a cursed lie) Luce made many other remarks which was  reported by G. D. Watt    ENDENTRY January 12, 1864 ~ Tuesday   12 FIGURE At Eleven oclok I called at the prision and was with  the prisioner untill a few moments before his Execution His wife and 5 children visited him last night  also this morning. He had gotton a woman with child who  was not his wife. He requested his Brothers to take care  of this woman and if they were permitted to take more than  one wife to take her to wife. He had a vary hard time to part with his wife children and Friends. He felt to confess all  of his and ask the forgiveness of God and all men for all  his crimes. He had worn his garments up to within an hour before his death. I advised him to take it off which He did   ENDENTRY Jan 112, 1864   He converse with me untill abut 12 oclok He asked me to pray with him that he might have strength to go to his Execution and pay the  penalty of his crimes.

Thus Ends the year 1862   ENDENTRY 1862  1862 Has past and left its trace upon the Historians  Record. It has been a vary important year it has fulfilled  the Historians predictions and the predictions of the prophets (see the last page of this record written ithe last day of Dec 1861)  There has been more blood shed, and lives lost in the United  States in the battles between the North and South in 1862 than there was in the war of 1812 with  Great Brittian. The most Bloodydy battles were faught at the following places Fort Donellson, Fair Oaks, 7 days battle before  Antietam,  Fredricksbugh. In these ten battles alone the number would not fall much short of half a  Million of men who were killed and wounded and then  there has been scores of Miner battles which have slain  many thousands. Many also have been slain by pest- ilence there has also been great destruction of property  by fire and otherwise. The spirit of Disunion seems to incr- ease among the people. There has been a great want of Bread in France during the past year caused in a great measure by closing up the southern ports which has stoped  the importation of cotton. France has opened a war with  Mexico and there is a great lack of confidence through- out the Earth betwen man and man and between all the Nations  of the Earth, there are many widows and orphans and  much morning and Lamentation through the Land in conseq- uence of the much blood which has been shed during the past  year but the End is not yet, but ownly Just commenced peace  is taken from the Earth and the wicked are inspired to  slay the wicked. While these things are going on the Saints  are gathering home to Zion to build up the kingdom of God, then  the Lord may reign over his Saints while Satan rules over his own Dominion. There has been Near 5000 Saints  gathered into these vallies during the past year. The Temple foundation has been taken up in part and relaid and many impro- vements have been made, and the Blessings of God have been upon Zion   ENDENTRY A Synopsis of my Labors in 1862   I Travelled 378 Miles   I Attended Public Meetings 128 Meetings   I Preached 27 discourses 27 Discourses   I Attended two general Conferencs 2 Conferences   I Attended 78 Prayer Circles 78 Prayer C.

He referd  to different Asstronemers who had in ages past marked  upon there maps the starry heavens and many of those fixed  stars had since been removed, and could not be seen and he  believed that when this Earth was consumed by fire and reorga- nized and became celestial that it could not be seen by the inhabitants of any planet in our solar system, or by any  Except a celestial body. The Zion of God must be a vast  body if it contained a Zion from all the creations which  God had made.

A Joint committee was app- inted to wait upon Govornor Brigham Young and informed him that the Assembly was organized and ready for any communication he might wish to make. Governor Young accompanied the committee to the State House and themet the Joint assembly and delivered to them his Message (see Printed Message) 2000 copies of the message was ordered to be printed and it was also to be printed in the Deserett News Govornor Young then addressed the assembly He said I wish to say a few words. Many may not be able to tell why we are in this capacity. I do not think that you see this thing as it is. Our organization will be kept up. We may not do much at present in this capacity yet what we have don or shall do will have its Effect. Our constitution which we sent to Washington has been closely scanned by the members of Congress all of our moves here are feared by the nations of the Earth Esspecially the United States. This body of men will give laws to the Nations of the Earth. We meet here in our seconed annual Legislature and I do not care whether you pass any laws this season or not But I do not wish you to loose one inch of ground you   ENDENTRY Jan 19 1863 have gained in your Organization but hold fast to it for this is the kingdom of God and we are the friends of God and you will find that much will grow out of this organiza- tion But I will say without the inspirations and revelations of God our acts are of no use. We are called the State Legislature but when the time comes we shall be called the kingdom of God Our Government is going to peaces and it will be like water that is spilt upon the ground that cannot be gathered if we do not take care of ourselves no one will take care of us We are the best of any people on the Earth, and there is no people as well off as this people on the Earth for light and the knowledge of God. In 1857 we said to 7000 troops stop and they stoped had there been but 500 like these troops here we should have let them come in for they would not have done any harm it is our business to take care of ourselves if we see the Enemy coming it is our duty to prepare for it. I can do better to never trade again in my life with a wicked man. I will name one thing. I built a theatre here myself. some wanted the Armey to come here I do not, and since the Armey got up a Theatre for themselves we have been crouded to the full. I will be richer in the End if the wicked do not come nigh. I do not care whether you sit one day or not. but I do not want you to loose any part of this Government which you have organized, for the time will come when these men will give laws to the Nations of the Earth Nauvoo and He said if we done our duty we should prevail over all our Enemies. we should get all things ready and when the time comes we should let the water onto the wheel and start the machine in Motion   President Kimball made a short address said He remembered well what Joseph Smith said upon the organization of this kingdom. He said if we done what was right we should be sustained by the Holy Ghost. we have to go step by step. The words of the prophet will be fulfilled upon the Earth and many of us will live to see the kingdom of God   ENDENTRY
