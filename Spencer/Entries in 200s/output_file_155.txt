 engaged in the State movement, and whatever you  pay out to newspapers or in other quarters which have  a direct bearing and are connected with the State move- ment, should be charged to the "Fund." Whatever may  be necesssary to expend in conducting the ordinary busi- ness such as has been heretofore done at sessions of  Congress, should be placed in the accounts they were  formerly charged to.  The suggestions concerning the Elders of  the Southern States were submitted to the Council and  they seemed to feel reluctant about withdrawing them  from the field entirely; but it was suggested that a letter be written to the President of the Southern States  Mission, asking him to make his arrangements so that  they would avoid laboring in places where hostility  was excited or where unfavorable comments would be  made by the press. I had, however, some little time  ago, suggested to Elder Wm Spry, (who presides now  over the Southern States Mission) this same line of 
 policy and called his attention to the position that  we were occupying at the present time in endeavoring to get a State government, and how necessary it was  that we should not create any more excitement in the  South than possible, as some of our friends in Congress  complained that their constituents wrote to them upon the subject. This letter, when read to the Council, ap- peared to be quite satisfactory to them. I have since  received a letter from Bro. Spry, in reply to mine upon this subject, in which he acquiesces and in- timates that he will carry out the policy suggested.  ^Attorneys Mal x^ It is with great regret that we hear  about the differences of views among our attorneys in  regard to the proper method of conducting the Church  suit. These differences weaken us very much and make  us feel that our property is in great jeopardy. (Maude wrote and telegraphed to us concerning an appeal.  He has appeared very anxious to have some plan  sent to him which he could bring through influential 
 friends before the Attorney General, so that the way might  be paved for carrying the case to the Supreme Court  and stopping the ixamination here. The telegrams which  we sent you contained this plan. We had Le Grand  Young, Sheeks & Rawlins and Judge Sutherland meet  with us and the dispatch that was sent you was  framed by them. They did not seem very clear in  their views about it; but Maude was so urgent to hear  from us that it seemed too bad that we could not  decide upon some way of getting this matter put in  shape that would bring it before the U.S. Supreme  Court for decision upon the constitutionality of the law.  He wrote to us and gave us the names of influential  parties that could be got to bring this matter before  Garland. We urged this upon our attorneys here several  times, but with no particular result until the night  when we sent you the dispatch, when we insisted on  something being given to us.) Of course, you will see  before this reaches you that Bro. M. M. Sheets has been 
 sent to the penitentiary. They hope, by means of this  case, through the merit of habeas corpus being brought before the U. S. Supreme Court, that the vital points which we wish to have decided can be reached. You  inform us, however, in your recent letter that our attor- neys there have doubts even upon this point. This seems to surprise Bro. LeGrand Young; for he asserts  that Col. Broadhead has written to him, asking why the habeas corpus case has not been obtained. We are doing the very best we can here, under the circumstances;  but the probabilities are, from present appearances, that  unless there should be something done to stop the  operations, this investigation will take a very wide range and every transaction of the Church will be  pryed into and, if possible, unsettled.  We telegraphed you in regard to Pad- dock. You said that you did not know how to  reach him. The U.P. people, doubtless, can check  him, if anyone can, as they, no doubt, contributed to his 
 election and without their aid he would ^not^ have been  where he is. Mr. Sidney Dillon has always mani-  fested a kind feeling, and perhaps Messrs. Shellaberger & Wilson, who are in the employ of the U.P. people,  might be able to furnish you some aid in getting  this matter before Mr. Dillon or the U.P. people. We deserve some aid at their hands, and if they  are appealed to properly they ought to render it.  We hope you will be able to get along with  the Woman's International Council without having  any tirade against us. Your proposal to aid them  is a good one and we hope you will be able to  carry it out and to check any such ebullition as is  threatened.  We entirely approve of the price that  you have offered Bro. John W. Young $25000 per  month for your board and lodgings for the four  months ending April 1st. We would like to see  him satisfied and hope that anything you can do 
 to comply with his wishes, if they are not intirely too  unreasonable, will be done by you.  We join in love to you, and the brethren  of the Council send their love. We constantly remem- ber you and uphold you in our faith and prayers,  and trust you will be kept from the hands of all  your enemies and be very successful in performing  every duty that devolves upon you.  We are Your Brethren,  Wilford Woodruff Geo. Q. Cannon  [sideways text] Committee. [end of sideways text]

 G. S. L. City Feby. 4 1857  Editor of the Mormon  Dear Sir, We have not received any Eastern mail for the last 3 months  Mr. Gerrish arrived from the Plains on the 19 th. Ulto, reports a mail  somewhere on the way. We have received the California Mail regularly up to  this time, by which we occasionally hear something from the lower world.  The Jan. mail for the East was sent out, but only got to the top of the little mountain, before it was stopped by the vast quantity of snow, and one carrier froze to death, the remainder returned. We are passing through the most severe winter so far as snow is concerned that we have ever ex- perienced in these vallies, the mountains are full, and over 8 feet has fallen in this city acording to Judge Phelps' report, it has lain for a  month between 2 & 3 feet deep in our streets, and about 3 feet on the islands & more North. All the stock have been brought from the Island, and some from the North, and were fed in the city, some driven South, and some to Rush valley, notwithstanding the great amount of snow there has been but few of the stock lost in comparison to the loss last winter. The abundance of Snow in the mountains will be of great benefit for irri- gation the coming season, the Earth needs it as it has been very dry fo[r] two years. The wheat which was sown in the dry dust last Fall has sprouted under the snow, and grown several inches, we have had a constant thaw for about one week past, which causes the water to gradually soak into the soil. The inhabitants of this city have again commenced labor upon the cotton wood canal, to bring that stream to this city, and they expect to finish it by the opening of Spring. the inhabitants of Davis County have also commenced on a Canal to take out a portion of the Weber river into Davis County for irrigation, mills &c. 
 We would like to have some of our Eastern friends forward us a few of the tubers of the chinese Potatoe as advertized by Wm. R. Prince Hoy. as we would like to make a trial of it in this Territory, we would also wish our friends who are emigrating to this Territory to still bear in mind, the propriety of  bringing with them or forwarding as they may have opportunity anychoice fruit seeds, cuttings, roots &c. that will be a benefit to the Territory. We would like to obtain some of Hoveys seedling strawberries or any other good kinds & Lawton's blackberry, Catawba & Isabella Grapes, Indigo or madder or cotten seeds, and seed from the chinese sugar cane or Millet. Hon. J. M. Bernhisel has blessed us from time to time with seeds and grain from the Patent office, some of which I think will prove quite a benefit to us for which we feel to return him our thanks.  The Reformation is progessing throughout this city and Territory with great interest. President Young has given much valuable information and teaching to the Quorums and people, although he has not been able to attend the meeting at the Tabernacle since the burial of President J. M. Grant on the 4th. Decem. Ulto. until last Sunday the 1st inst. He with his counsellors H. C. Kimball & D. H Wells all appeared in the stand, the Tabernacle was crowded to overflowing as has been the case nearly all Winter and hundreds have to l[e]ave who cannot get into the house. the appearance of Prest. Young in the Tabernacle after an absence of two months created a sensation throughout the vast assembly, he addressed the people for about one hour and a half, his discourse was very interesting and edifying to the people, he was clothed with the spirit and power of God and the hearts of the people were open to receive his words which were quick & powerful. He was followed by Presidents Kimball and Wells, all of the discourses will appear in the News. President Kimball has spoken to the people for several Sabbaths previous upon several subjects in great plainness presenting 
 the parable of the vineyard, the vine &c., to illustrate his ideas, his teachings have been of much benefit to the Saints. The Twelve who were here, have gone forward with the missionaries through every ward in the city, teaching the Elders and the people, meeting with the various Quorums of the church, we have attended a meeting of some kind al- most every evening for three months. The people are rising up en masse and trying to live their religion, by confessing and forsaking their sins,  and preparing for the waters of Baptism, the spirit and power of God is manifest in Zion. The word of the Lord through his servants who are clothed with the power of God and the fire of the Holy Ghost causes the sinner to tremble and fearfulness to surprize the hypocrite, and the people universally feel like putting away sin and iniquity of every kind. all places of worship both in the city and country are crowded to excess. The people are beginning more to feel the importance of living their religion magnifying their calling and building up the kingdom of God. Their has been four of the quorum of the Twelve in this city during the sitting of the Legislature viz. O Hyde, L. Snow, F. D. Richards & myself. Elder Hyde has now gone South on a mission through the city and brother Snow is mostly confined to Box Elder. Elder Richards & myself remain in this city at present. we expect Elders A. Lyman & C. C. Rich will be with us this Spring.  yours truly, W. Woodruff 
 Bro. Taylor. I have named in my letter that I wished to get the chinese Potatoe. I have written to J. M. Bernhisel to see something about it but not knowing that he will be able to do it, I wish you would send to Wm. R. Prince $5.00 and direct him to put up that amount, and send it to W. Woodruff, Great Salt Lake city U T & I will pay the money here in any way that you will order.  W. W 
 TO THE SAINTS:  To the officers and members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-  day Saints, in General Conference assembled:  Dear Brethren  and Sisters  Every Latter-day Saint will recognize the value of union, not only in action but in the matters of faith and discipline. As  to the rights and authority of the Priesthood of the Son of God, it is of the highest importance of opinion among the officers and members of the Church of  Jesus Chr[i]st of Latter-day  Saints. Feeling the necessity if a cor- rect understanding of this prin- ciple, we deem it proper at  this sixty-sixth anniversary of the  organization of the Church in these last days, to prepare and present state- ment on the subject, embodying the  doctrine which has always prevailed in the Church, and our views upon it. We are prompted to adopt this course at the present time because of events which have happened during the late political contest. A great diversity of  opinion on the subject has been ex- pressed, and even by leading Elders in the Church, which latter fact has naturally led in some instances to  considerable division of sentiment.  It is of great importance that we un- derstand each other and that there be  harmony in our teachings. It is espec- ially important that these teachings shall be in accordance with the rules and regulations and doctrines which have been taught and which have pre- vailed from the beginning until the present time, having not only the sanction of undisputed usage, but the  approval of all faithful leaders in the Church and of Him in whose name and by whose authority they act.  In the late exciting contest, to which reference has been made, the presiding authorities in some instances have been misunderstood. In other instances  they have been misrepresented, which has led to a wrongful conception of their real views. It has been asserted too freely, and without foundation, that there has been a disposition on their part to in- terfere with individual liberty and to  rebuke in some men a course which  was applauded in others. In a word, that they have appeared to desire to assert and maintain an unjust and op- pressive control over the actions of the  members of the Church, and in thus doing have endeavored to effect a Union of Church and State. In the heat of political discussion,  asser- tions have been made and ar- guments used conveying to the pub- [l]ic mind a false idea concerning 
 the position of the officers of the Church, and leaving the impres- sion that there has been and was now being made an attempt to ac- complish the union above referred to. Now that the excitement has passed, and calmer reason has resumed its sway, we think it prudent to set forth, so that all may understand, the exact position occupied by the leading au- thorities of the Church.  In the first place we wish to state in the most positive and emphatic lan- guage that at no time has there ever been any attempt or even desire on the part of the leading authorities referred to to have the Church in any manner encroach upon the rights of the State,  or to unite in any degree the functions of the one with those of the other. Peculiar circumstances have sur- rounded the people of Utah. For many years a majority of them in every por- tion of the Territory belonged to one Church, every reputable member of which was entitled to hold and [old] some ecclesiastical office. It is easy to see how, to the casual ob- server, it might appear singular that so many officers of the Church were also officers of the State; but while this was in fact the case, the distinc- tion between the Church and the State throughout those years was carefully maintained. The President of the  Church held for eight years the high- est civil office in the community, having been appointed by the national administration governor of the Ter- ritory. The first secretary of the Terr- tory was a prominent Church official. An Apostle represented the Territory in Congress as a delegate during ten years. The members of the Legisla- ture held also offices in the Church. This was unavoidable; for the most suitable men were elected by the votes  of the people, and, as we have stated, every reputable man in the entire com- munity held some Church position, the most energetic and capable hold- ing leading positions. This is all natural and plain enough to  those who consider the cir- cumstances; but it furnished oppor- tunity for those who were disposed to  assail the people of the Territory to charge them with attempting to unite Church and State. A fair investigation of the conditions will abundantly dis- prove the charge and show its utter falsity.  On behalf of the Church of which we are leading officers, we desire again to state to the members and also to the public generally, that there has not been, not is there, the remotest desire on our part or on the part of our co- religionists to do anything looking to a union of Church and State.  We declare that there has never been any attempt to curtail individual liberty   the personal liberty of any of the officers or members of the Church. The First Presidency and other lead- ing officers did make certain sugges- tions to the people when the division  on party lines took place. That move- ment was an entirely new departure, and it was necessary, in order that the full benefit should not be lost which was hoped to result from this new political division, that people who were inexperi- enced should be warned against hasty and ill-considered action. In some cases they were counseled to be wise and prudent in the political steps they were about to take, and this with no idea of winning them against their will to either side. To this extent, and  no further, was anything said or done upon this question, and at no time and under no circumstances was any attempt made to say to voters how they should cast their ballots. Any charge that has been made to the contrary is ut- terly false.  Concerning officers of the Church themselves, the feeling was generally expressed in the beginning of the po- litical division spoken of that it would be prudent for leading men not to ac- cept of office at the hands of the po- litical party to which they might be- long. This counsel was given to men of both parties alike   not because it was thought that there was any impro- priety in religious men holding civil office, not to deprive them of any of the rights of citizenship, but because of the feeling that it would be better under all the circumstances which had now arisen to avoid any action that would be likely to create jealousy and  ill-feeling. An era of peace and good-will seemed to be dawning upon the people, and it was deemed good to shun everything that could have the  least tendency to prevent the con- summation of this happy pros- pect. In many instances, how- ever, the pressure brought to bear upon efficient and popular men by the members of the parties to which they belonged was of such a character that they had to yield to the solicitation to accept nomination to office, or sub- ject themselves to the suspicion of bad faith in their party affiliations. In some cases they did this without con- sulting the authorities of the Church; but where important positions were held, and where the duties were of a responsible and exacting character, some did seek the counsel and ad- vice of the leading Church authorities before accepting the political honors tendered them. Because some others did not seek this counsel and advice, ill-feeling was engendered, and undue and painful sensitiveness was stimu- lated; misunderstanding readily fol- lowed and as a result the authorities of the Church were accused of bad faith and made the subjects of bitter reproach. We have maintained that in the case of men who hold high positions in the Church, whose duties are well defined, and whose ec- clesiastical labors are understood to be continuous and necessary, it would be an improper thing to ac- cept political office or enter into any vocation that would distract or remove them from the religious duties resting upon them, without first consulting and obtainig the approval of their  associates and those who preside over them. It has been understood from the very beginning of the Church that no officer whose duties are of the  character referred to, has the right to  engage in any pursuit, political or otherwise, that will divide his time and  remove his attention from the calling already accepted. It has been the constant practice with officers of the Church to consult or, to use our lan- guage, to "counsel" with  their breth- ren concerning all questions of this kind. They have not felt that they were sacrificing their manhood in do- ing so, nor that they were submitting to improper dictation, nor that in so- liciting and acting upon the advice of those over them, they were in any manner doing away with their individual rights and agency, nor that to any improper de- gree were their rights and duties as American citizens being abridged or  interfered with. They realized that in accepting ecclesiastical office they assumed certain obligations; that among these was the obligation to magnify the office which they held, to attend to the duties in preference to  every other labor, and to devote them- selves exclusively to it with all the zeal, industry and strength they possessed, unless released in part or for a time by those who preside over them. Our view, and it has been the view of all our prede- cessors, is that no officer of our Church,  especially those in high standing, should take a course to violate this long- established practice. Rather than disobey it, and declare himself by his actions defiantly independent of his associates and his file leaders, it has always been held that it would be better for a man to resign the duties of his Priesthood: and we entertain the same view today.  In view of all the occurrences to which reference has been made, and to the diversity of views that have arisen among the people in consequence, we 
 feel it to be our duty to clearly define our position, so there may be no cause hereafter for dispute or controversy upon the subject.  First We unanimously agree to and promulgate as a rule that should al- ways be observed in the Church and by every leading official thereof, that before accepting any position, political or otherwise, which would interfere with the proper and complete discharge of his ecclesi- astical duties, and before accepting a nomination or entering into engage- ments to perform new duties, said official should apply to the proper au- thorities and learn from them whether be can, consistently with the obliga- tions already entered into with the Church upon assuming his office, take upon himself the added duties and labors and responsibilities of the new position. To maintain proper discipline and order in the Church, we deem this absolutely necessary; and in as- serting this rule, we do not consider that we are infringing in the least de- gree upon the individual rights of the citizen. Our position is that a man having accepted the honors and oblige- tions of ecclesiastical office in the Church cannot properly of his own volition make those honors subordi- nate to or even co-ordinate which new ones of  an entirely different character; we hold that unless he is willing to counsel with and obtain the con- sent of his fellow-laborers and presid- ing officers in the Priesthood, he should be released from all obligations associated with the latter, before ac- cepting any new position.  Second We declare that in making these requirements of ourselves and our brethren in the ministry, we do not in the least desire to dictate to them concerning, or to interfere with the affairs of the State; neither do we consider that in the remotest degree we are seeking the union of Church and State. We once more here repudiate the insinua- tion that there is or ever has been an attempt by our leading men to trespass upon the ground occupied by the State, or that there has been or is the wish curtail in any manner any of its func- tions.

And we want to eventually invite men, with their counselors aide, to meet with us on this occasion, and earnestly hope we can be privileged to have your presence.  We are your brother  in the Gospel,  Joseph H. Felt, Royal E. Young,  James W. Eardly,  Stake Suptc'y of Y. M. M. I. A.  St. J. W. Mussen, 
  Wilford Woodruff, Gen'l. Supt. Y.M.M.I.A.  Dear Brother: We respectfully submit the following questions which have been proposed to us, and which we hope to be able to answer at our Stake Y.M.M.I.A. Conference on Sunday next:  1st. What shall we do for Manuals No. 1? As many new members are joining the associations, a greater part of whom are young people and  have received no manuals. We find it impracticable to proceed without manuals.  2nd. How can we obtain Manual No. 2? It is only published in  the contributor, and but few of our members are able to subscribe for it.  3rd. In most of our Associations there are many members who been through Manual No. 1, two or three times, and are now prepared to take Manual No. 2, and others in the same associations who have not yet been through Manual No. 1; How shall we conduct both classes?  Hoping you will give this matter your immediate attention.  Your Brethren, Stake Supt'cy. Y.M.M.I.A. 
 ELDERS JOURNAL  Vinalhaven, Fox Islands, Me. March 9th, 1838.  BISHOP EDWARD PARTRIDGE, and PRESI- DENTS JOSEPH SMITH JR., SIDNEY RIGDON, HYRUM SMITH, and THE SAINTS IN ZION, GREETING:  Dear friends in the new and everlasting covenant;  I, Willford Woodruff, sit  down to inform you, that I have just  heard, correctly, of the deplorable state  of things in Kirtland, and I have this  day held a council with Elders J. Ball  and J. Townsend, who are now with  me upon these Islands, and we resolved  to address a few lines to you concern- ing our feelings, and set before you a  brief account of things with us, and the  course we intend to pursue. I have  labored principally alone upon these  Islands, since Elder Hale left last fall,  and the work of the Lord has prosper- ed in my hands, or in other words, the  Lord has worked with me during the  winter. Elder Joseph Ball has been  with me for a number of weeks past  upon the Islands. There is rising of  40 members in the church on these Isl- ands, and they are strong in the faith.  I returned last evening from a mission  in company with Elder James Town- send. we have been visiting the most  notable cities and vilages in the eastern  country, and delivering unto them the  word of God.  We preached in their City Halls,  Chapels, School houses, dwellings &c.,  in such places as Camden, Belfast,  Northport, Frankfort, Hampden and  the City of Bangor. Doors were open  in all of these places, and many others  I might mention, and the people heard  with profound attention; and many are  believing. I never saw more doors  open for doing good, than at the pres- ent time in the State of Maine: But  the Devil is stired up against me here  on the Island.  One Methodist priest has applied  several times for a warrant to take me,  but the Officers, as yet, will not grant  him any, for he cannot bring any ac- cusation against me in truth or justice.  The most trouble I now have, is the  stopping the papers. I have forwarded  about 30 subscribers with the money,  and now the press is burnt down, and  our enemies roar in the midst of the  congregations, and they set up these  ensigns for signs.  I expect the report of these things  will come like a clap of thunder in the  ears of the Saints upon these Islands  and else where. They do not know it  yet, but are wondering why these pa- pers do not come. We have appointed  a time to meet the church, and we  shall lay all these things before them  and trust in God for wisdom to direct  us. The Elders that are with me are  expecting to go to their homes, and I  shall be left to fight the battles alone.  Brethren, pray for me out of Zion,  for I have a load to bear; but in the  name of Elijah's God, I am determined  to stand at my post. I feel as though  the time of Jacob's trouble had began,  but I know God will deliver him out of  it, and fulfil his word.  We are advising the Saints of God  to go from this country to Zion, as soon  as they can. I suppose this is right:  many are preparing to go the following  season.  Now we say to the Presidency of the  church in Zion; we do not expect to  counsel you, nor any one there, let  God be your counselors. But we ask,  can it not be consistent with the will of  God and your feelings and circum- stances, to soon publish the Elders' Journal from Zion, that we may have  one weapon, to cut away some of the  deep gloom, that will be cast upon the  minds of thousands of the Saints, by  wicked men and devils, and false breth- ren. The traveling Elders feel the  wait of these things, equally, if not  more than those who are in Zion; for  we are naked targets to the press and  tongue, as we pass through the midst  of the Gentiles. O my God! have  mercy and support us, I pray, through  the toils that are to come, that our gar- ments may be washed white in the  blood of the Lamb! for it is through  tribulation that we inherit the blessing  and overcome.  Could the Elders' Journal be contin- ued, it would be great relief to the feel- ings of all the faithful; for while our  enemies are publishing against us,  even in Kirtland, we should also know  what God is doing for his Saints.  Brethren, we pray you to consider  this last clause, not for our sake alone,  but for the sake of all the faithful that  are scattered abroad. We do not make  these remarks because we have any  lack of confidence in you No. God  forbid, we believe you have done, and  will do all that lies in your power for 
 ELDERS JOURNAL  the salvation of Israel; and for one, I  pray God to take away my life, sooner  than to suffer me to turn my back upon  the faithful part of the church of Latter  Day Saints, and Joseph whom God  hath chosen to lead his people. O my  soul mourns over the corruptions of the  hearts of men! O how man will stum- ble in dark places, when he neglects  prayer and departs from his God! O  ye Saints of Zion, watch and pray, and  keep the Celestial law, which is safe!  That you may know the feelings of  the undersigners of this page, we say  to you before God, that we are in full  fellowship with Joseph Smith jr. and  the first Presidency of the church, and  with all who still adhere to, and receive  their teachings and instructions; and  we say, in the name of Jesus Christ,  that we will uphold such by our pray- ers, faith, and influence, at the risk of  our fortunes, lives, and worldly honor.  "For life is but a name, when virtue  and truth is gone."  We further believe, that judgment  awaits the world speedily, Kirtland not  excepted, and we do believe that those  who have dissented from the body of the  church, will have cause to lament for  their folly. We ask in the name of  reason and revelation, who has power  to take from Joseph, the keys delivered  to him by the God of Abraham, Isaac,  and Jacob, and deprive him of the  work that God has said he should per- form? We answer, none but God  alone. We believe the book of Mor- mon and Doctrine and Covenants,  speaks too loud upon the subject, to  fall unfulfilled and to be made void, by  those who have neglected prayer, and  departed from the living God, and  sought to take honor unto themselves.   O ye Saints of God in Zion! we en- treat you to uphold Joseph by prayer,  faith, brotherly love, and charity: for  we testify, in the Spirit of God, that he  will be brought off conqueror, and his  enemies put to shame.  Do you remember his toils and la- bors for your salvation? Nothing but  a God has supported him to the present  day. His perils are great, and the  greatest are among false brethren;  and we do entreat the Saints in Zion  not to add to his wounds, by following  the example of many in Kirtland.  Bear with us, ye Saints of God, while  we exhort you to keep the Celestial  law of God, while in the land of Zion.  Be humble, be watchful, be prayerful.  Beware of pride, lest you fall like oth- ers. We do not make these remarks  for compliment sake, we feel what we  say. Kirtland is and will be scourged,  to fulfill revelation and prophecy; it is  all right, the hand of God is in it.   God's work will not stop. He will  work for, and with his Saints. God  will redeem Jacob. God will build up  Zion. The Lord will establish Jerusa- lem. And O ye Judges in Zion! that  God may bestow wisdom and salvation  upon you, is the prayer of  WILFORD WOODRUFF, JAMES TOWNSEND, & JOSEPH BALL.

 [stamp] BRIGHAM YOUNG  COLLEGE,  LOGAN, UTAH.  CIRCULAR No. 7.  (Circular Addressed by the General Church Board of Education to Presidents of Stakes, June 8th, 1888.)  Dear Brethren: A meeting of the General Board of Educa- tion was held today, and the subject of the educational interests of the Latter-day Saints was taken into consideration and discussed at some length.  It was decided that a Board of Education, consisting of not less than five and not to exceed eight in number, should be selected in each Stake to take charge of and promote the interests of edu- cation in the Stake.  This communication is addressed to you to inform you of this  action, and to have you select energetic men who are friends of education, who understand the needs of the people, and who have influence with the Saints, to carry out any suggestions in this direc- tion that may be deemed desirable.  In the decision which was reached by our General Board, it  was made the duty of these local Boards to take into consideration  the formation of Church Schools, and the best method of accom- plishing this, and after arriving at proper conclusions, to report them to the General Board.  Communications of this character may be addressed to Elder  George Reynolds, who is Secretary of the Board.  It was felt by the General Board that, to begin with, there should be one Stake Academy established in each Stake as soon as practi- cable.  The education of our children under correct influences and in  the spirit of the gospel ought to be very dear to every Latter-day 
 Saint, and we are impressed that the time has arrived for a com- mencement to be made in this direction.  The desire is universally expressed by all thinking people in the Church, that we should have schools wherein the Bible, the Book of Mormon, and the book of Doctrine and Covenants can be used as class books, and wherein the principles of our religion may form a part of the teaching of the schools.  To effect this it will be necessary that funds be collected. The Church will doubtless do its share; but it cannot carry the entire burden. The Saints must be appealed to.  There are hundreds of liberal-minded people among us who are willing to contribute to this worthy object when they find the subject is receiving due attention, and that definite and perma- nent arrangements are being made to establish schools of this character.  The brethren whom you select to form this Board should be  men of character and integrity among the people, who will be able  to use an influence in the collection of funds, so that schools may be established, good faculties be employed, and tuition be made so cheap that an education will be within the reach of the humblest in the land.  After you have made a suitable selection for this Board, the names of the brethren composing it should be presented regularly at your Stake Conferences as other authorities are, so that the people can vote for them.  Very respectfully yours,  WILFORD WOODRUFF, Chairman of the Church Board of Education.  GEORGE REYNOLDS, Secretary. 
 To the Presidents of Stakes, Stake and Local Boards of Education, and Principals and Faculties of all Church Schools:  At the commencement of our labors as the General Board of Education, the peculiar condition of the Church affairs compelled  us to be careful in holding out hopes of financial aid in the organ- izing of new schools; we therefore confined ourselves to the an- nouncement of some of the principles upon which it would be  desirable to have our new educational system organized and con- ducted. But the active energy displayed by so many of the Stakes of Zion, in response to our first circular, not only in organizing their respective Boards, but also in proceeding at once to raise sub- scriptions to procure furniture and apparatus, and to call for Princi- pals and Teachers, furnishes proof that the time is ripe for the in- troduction of this new educational system, and that the people are ready to sustain and carry it out. Applications for assistance to help institutions already started and to start others are numerous; but the Board is not, at present, in a position to give all the aid asked for, and must, of necessity, proceed carefully in its disburse- ments.  However, we have an unfaltering faith that the Spirit which prompted the inception of this system of education, will assist in the progress of the work; until, by united effort, patient presever- ance, sincere devotion, intelligent application, and firm reliance up- on the blessings of God, all our difficulties will be gradually over- come, and our educational affairs be placed upon a satisfactory basis in all the Stakes of Zion.  Although the attainment of so desirable an end requires its time of development, there are a few points within reach, to which we desire to call your attention.  1st. It is essential that this Board receive an Annual Finan- cial Statement from the Treasurer of each Church School, with such other items as will more perfectly explain the financial condition of the institution, on or before July 15th, of each year. This state- 
 ment should be endorsed by an auditing committee, and counter- signed by the President and Secretary of the Board.  2. In connection with the above, we also desire an Annual  Statistical Report, signed by the President and Secretary of the Board, and by the Principal and Secretary of the Faculty.  3. The General Superintendent, under instructions from the General Board, will communicate directly with the Principals and Teachers for the purpose of harmonizing their labors in such a manner as will insure to the youth of Zion the greatest amount of good, and to the Teachers a sufficient scope for their individuality.  4. It will, doubtless, be productive of better results for the Principals of the different Stake Academies or Colleges to be appointed by the General Board upon the recommendation of the General Superintendent; yet this will only be done after consulta- tion with the respective Stake Boards to the end that their wishes may be fully satisfied. The other Teachers should be appointed by  the Stake Boards, upon the recommendation of the Principal.  5. The system of teaching inaugurated at the Brigham Young Academy, of Provo, is that which we wish introduced in all our Church Schools.  6. All communications between the General Board and Gen- eral Superintendent on the one side, and the Stake Boards or Principals and Teachers on the other, should be kept on file for reference.  7. The General Superintendent will be instructed by this Board to visit the schools at certain intervals, to meet with the res- pective Boards and Faculties, to give instructions and to make such enquiries as will enable him to render us complete reports from time to time.  CONVENTIONS.  All Church Schools are organized into District Conventions according to instructions published in the Juvenile Instructor. The Chairman of each convention will be appointed by the General Board.  An Annual Convention will be held at Salt Lake City, at which  all Church Schools should be officially represented. 
 BOARD OF EXAMINERS.  A Board of Examiners has been created by the General Board. This Board of Examiners may call to its aid any specialists, as cir- cumstances may require, subject, however, to the approval of the  General Board.  Course of Procedure Relative to the Examination of Church School Instruc- tors and the Awarding of Certificates and Diplomas.  No teacher is eligible to act in any Church School who does not hold a License or Certificate from the General Board of Educa- tion.  Licenses and Certificates may be obtained under the following conditions:  Annual Licenses. Teachers of at least one year's practical ex- perience, or graduates from one of our Normal Schools, desiring to  enter the Church School service, should make written application  to the General Superintendent. They should in this application promise to teach in accordance with the instructions given by the General Board of Education. They should enclose their Bishops' Certificates of Church standing, and any testimonials or certificates of efficiency they may have. If such documents are satisfactory, an Annual License for either the Primary or the Intermediate Grade may be issued, pending examination before the Board of Ex- aminers for a standing certificate in the respective grade.  Upon the recommendation of the Board of Examiners, Stand- ing Certificates will be issued by the General Board for the Primary Grade, for the Intermediate Grade, and to Specialists for their particu- lar branches, and Diplomas for the Academic Grade, to all successful candidates.  The title of Professor will be recognized as applicable in Church Schools to those only who hold Academic diplomas as specified above.  The Board of Examiners will give public notice of the dates  and places of annual examinations at least four weeks previous thereto.  Candidates for a degree in any of our Academic courses must  give notice of their intention to the General Superintendent at least  two months before their examination. 
 Diplomas or certificates from any well-known University or College may receive due consideration for the corresponding studies in our curriculum.  Candidates for examination will be required to deposit the fol- lowing fees in advance: Primary grade, $3.00; Intermediate grade, $5.00; Academic degree, $10.00; Special certificate, $3.00.  No academic studies should be announced in Circulars or be taught in any of our Church Schools, unless conducted by teachers properly licensed or certificated in these branches.  A teacher, after having obtained a certificate for the Interme- diate Grade, may enter at once upon a course of partial examina- tion for the Academic Grade, under the regulations governing such procedure. A license for the teaching of any special study in the Academic Grade, pending the final examination, may be issued to any one who successfully passes in such branch.  In answer to the many inquiries regarding the range of the  various examinations, the following schedule of requirements is announced. Evidence of ability to teach these branches as well as an acquaintance with the subject matter will be required.  Requirements for the Primary Grade.  1. Theology.

SALT LAKE CITY, Utah, Oct. 29th, 1890.  To the Presidents of Stakes, Bishops, and all whom it may concern:  DEAR BRETHREN AND SISTERS: The all-absorbing motive that  led the great majority of the Latter-day Saints to forsake their homes  in their various nations to dwell in these mountain valleys was an  ardent desire to serve the Lord more perfectly and with a better  understanding. In too many instances, in the course of the years,  this grand object has been lost sight of in the toil for daily exist- ence, and less noble aims have largely taken the place of the en- deavor to learn the ways of the Lord and of the effort to walk in  His paths. This benumbing influence on our spiritual life is widely  felt in our homes, and more particularly affects our children, whose  faith in the great latter-day work has not been developed and  strengthened by the experience which their elders have had in lands  beyond the borders of Zion. Nor does the training which our  youth receive in the District Schools increase their feelings of devo- tion to God and love for His cause, for, as is well known, all teach- 
 ings of a religious character are rigorously excluded from the stud- ies permitted in these institutions.  To lessen this great evil, and counteract the tendencies that  grow out of a Godless education, the Church schools of the Saints  have been established. But while these accomplish great good, the  sphere of their usefulness does not cover the entire field. There are  many places where Church schools cannot, at present, be estab- lished; and also many Saints in those places where such schools ex- ist, who, for various reasons, cannot send their children thereto.  For these causes we have deemed it prudent to suggest to the vari- ous local authorities other measures which, while not occupying the  place of the Church Schools, will work on the same lines, and aid in  the same work in which the Church educational institutions are en- gaged.  We suggest that in every ward where a Church school is not  established, that some brother or sister, or brethren and sisters, well  adapted for such a responsible position by their intelligence and  devotion, as well as their love for the young, be called, as on a mis- sion, by the Bishop, after consultation with the President of the  Stake, to take charge of a school wherein the first principles of the  Gospel, Church history, and kindred subjects shall be taught. This  school to meet for a short time each afternoon after the close of the  district school, or for a longer time on the Saturday only, as may in  each ward be deemed most consistent with the situation of the peo- ple and most likely to secure a good attendance of the children. In  some cases it will be found that the children are too wearied after  their usual daily studies to take interest in a class of this kind; in  others, Saturday may prove to be an unsuitable day.  Where arrangements can be made it will, as a general thing, be  well to secure the district school room for this purpose, so that when  they take place in the afternoon, these exercises can commence im- mediately after the regular sessions and before the children scatter;  but where this is done care must be taken to keep the two entirely  separate, so that the law may not be infringed upon. Where the  regular school room cannot be obtained, some building conveniently  situated, and as near as possible, should be secured in its stead; the  object being to secure the attendance, as far as possible, of the chil- dren of all the Latter-day Saints. A strenuous effort should likewise 
 be made to gain the hearty co-operation of the parents, as without  their aid the school will measurably fail in the object of its crea- tion.  We deem it desirable that every school thus established should  be under the guidance and direction of the General Board of Edu- cation; and those brethren and sisters who accept this call will re- ceive a license from the Board to act in this capacity. Suggestions  with regard to the studies, etc., will also be issued by the General  Board, and other means be adopted to place these classes in harmony  with the methods of the Church School system, of which, in fact,  they will form an important part. Where it is found necessary to  pay the teacher a small stipend for his services, the General Board  of Education should be consulted through the State Board; but it  is thought that the incidental expenses for fuel, etc., may, without  inconvenience, be met by the ward, or by the people whose children  are benefited.  With a constant desire for the progress of all true education,  we remain, with much respect,  Your brethren in the Gospel,  WILFORD WOODRUFF, GEORGE Q. CANNON, JOS. F. SMITH,  First Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ  of Latter-day Saints.  In accordance with the foregoing circular, the General Board  of Education has selected the Juvenile Instructor as the official  organ of communication for these Religion Classes and for all  our Church Schools. The first number in each month will be used  as the medium of Church School papers.  It is essential that such copies of the Juvenile Instructor be kept  on file for reference in all Church Schools and Religion Classes.  CONDUCTING OF CHURCH SCHOOLS.  The Academic Year.  The General Board has been informed that a few of our Stake  Boards intend to continue their schools only part of the academic 
 year. As no efficient teacher can be expected to accept such a tem- porary engagement, it is obvious that these schools would have to  depend on "makeshift" arrangements, to the detriment of their  pupils and in opposition to the high aim of our educational system.  We, therefore, desire that Stake Academies make no deviation  from the regular academic year of forty weeks without consulting  the General Superintendent.  Buildings and Furniture.  The General Board of Education has repeatedly been asked to  furnish plans for school buildings, but in consideration of the variety  of conditions, plans generally applicable can not be furnished. We  call the attention of the Boards of Education to the fact that an  elaborate architectural edifice is not essential for a successful school,  but that the consideration of the teachers' support, the health and the  comfort of students, and the condition of school furniture and uten- sils is of far greater importance.  Circulars.  Several of the circulars heretofore published by Stake and Local  Boards have not been in conformity with the instructions of the  General Board. We urge upon you the necessity of care in this  respect, and recommend that you correspond with the General  Superintendent before introducing any essential variation.  Principals and Faculties.  Members of faculties, Principals excepted, should not hold office  in the Stake Boards. Principals are "ex-officio" members of their  respective Stake Boards.  In order to regulate the somewhat irregular mode of cor- respondence that has been carried on between the Principals and  the General Superintendent, it is found necessary to have at least  one official communication per term from each Principal to the  General Superintendent, furnishing such information as may enable  the latter to properly represent the respective institution in his re- ports to the President of the General Board.  The Principals will please furnish the General Superintendent 
 a complete list of their regular and special teachers, with respective  curricula, salaries, length of service in the institution, and all other  data of interest.  Should a new department be organized or an old one be dis- continued in any Stake Academy or Seminary by the Local Board,  such action should be reported to the General Superintendent.  When Missionary Meetings and Polysophical Societies are  organized, care must be taken that the interests of Sunday Schools  and Mutual Improvement Associations be not interfered with, but  rather that the influence of our teachers be directed to in support of  those institutions.  The General Superintendent should be furnished with copies  of the Daily Programs, and Principals' Reports. Suggestions tend- ing to bring gradually our whole educational system into an har- monious whole will be gladly received. He should also be notified,  at a reasonably early date, of every public examination to be held.  Teachers' Salaries.  The amount of salaries for Principals and Teachers is left, at  present,  to mutual agreement between the respective Boards and  Teachers, but care must be taken that the terms to be made upon the  basis of strict business principles, and they be honorably adhered  to.  Libraries.  Each Church School should have the following books in its Libra- ry, as they are considererd indispensable: 1. Unabridged Dictionary.   2. Encyclopedia. 3. All the standard Church works and publi- cations. 4. Popular text books in all branches taught, beside those  adopted, for reference, by teachers and students. 5. Revised Laws  of Utah. 6. Ordinances of the city in which the institution is  located. 7. History of the World.  Current Literature.  1. We recommend that each institution  keep the Deseret News, Juvenile Instructor, and local papers, also one  or more educational, scientific, and literary magazines.  A catalogue of all books and papers should be strictly kept and  the books classified. In connection with the Library there should be  a Reading Room. 
 Cabinets.  A cabinet of specimens, for illustration, is indispensable to the  study of the sciences.  Valuable specimens may be obtained: by excursions to  mountains, caves, mines, factories, gardens, fields and places of  note; also by exchanges of duplicates, and by contributions  from patrons, students, and missionaries abroad. The specimens  should be correctly classified, labeled and catalogued.  Pieces of apparatus, such as cannot be made under the super- vision of the teacher, may be obtained advantageously by consulting  with the Principals of our Colleges.  Records.  Besides the blanks for the Statistical and Financial Annual  Reports, furnished by the General Board, the following records are  deemed necessary to be kept with the greatest care, by the respec- tive Principals and their assistants:  1. General or Annual Record with accompanying Index, con- taining name, age, parentage, home, time of entering, depart- ments, attendance during each term, Church standing, remarks,  etc., of each pupil.  2. Records of Plans and Programs containing the grading  and plans for all courses and classes for each term of the school  year.  3. Register of Studies, containing the reports of the class work  per week.  4. Minutes of Faculty, containing also the Principal s Reports,  Programs of Examination, and Minutes of Academic Councils.  5. Records of Standing, containing the percentage of standing  of the students in their respective departments and classes; from  which every parent or guardian should be furnished an abstract at  the end of the term.  6. Teachers  Records of Daily Attendance and Preparation.  NOTE. The mode of keeping some of these records will have to be left optional with  each Principal, provided that the records themselves are kept, subject to the inspection of  the General Superintendent at his periodical visits.  Historical Records.  The importance of keeping historical records of our Church 
 School organization can not be over-estimated, and in order that  the Church Historian be in a position to keep an accurate record of  our educational movement, the General Superintendent is required  to furnish him annually a summary from the special reports of the  various Church Schools. The special report of each institution  should be drawn up by the Principal thereof, and, after being  endorsed by the President and Secretary of the respective Boards,  should be sent to the General Superintendent on or before July 15,  every year.  Lady Teachers.  We urgently recommend that each of our Church Schools  have the benefit of a Lady Teacher not only qualified to instruct in the common branches, but also able to conduct ladies' work, have  special charge of the lady students, and, if possible, be acquainted  with the principles of  Physiology, Hygiene, Domestic Science,  Drawing, Music, and Kindergarten work.  General Circular No. 6 contains particulars for the guidance of  our Lady Teachers.  Music Teachers.  Great importance should be attached to the cultivation of Music  in our Church Schools. It is, therefore, recommended that the  various Boards of Education make it their special care to procure  competent Music Teachers.  Theology.  Having learned of the great success attending the use of the  Sunday School Leaflets and Picture Charts in the Primary and  Preparatory, of the "Story of the Book of Mormon" in the Interme- diate, and of the Juvenile Instructor in all of these departments in  some of our schools, the General Board recommends the adoption  of these publications throughout our Church School organization,  in addition to the text-books already in use. It is the intention of  the Church Authorities to cause other theological works to be pre- pared with special reference to the needs of our Church Schools.  Discipline.  A judicious teacher will rarely have occasion to supplant emu- lative means of discipline by compulsory ones. 
 Academic Councils. In serious cases of misdemeanor, or when  all available means of discipline have been exhausted, the Principal  may refer the case to the action of an Academic Council, accord- ing to the following procedure: The Principal should notify in  writing the President of his Board, and request the summoning of  an Academic Council to try the case. The President should ap- point a meeting of that Council at the earliest possible convenience,  and cause the parents or guardians of the defendant to be notified  also of the time and place of the trial. The Academic Council  should be composed of at least three members of the Board, and  the Principal and regular teachers of the school. The President, or  some other member of the Board, appointed by the former for the  occasion, presiding. Copies of the charge and the minutes of the  proceedings must be kept on record. In case of expulsion, no such  defendant can enter any other Church School until forgiveness from  the Academic Council that expelled him has been obtained.  The  General Superintendent must be notified of all such cases. The  spirit and mode of procedure in the High Councils should be taken  as a pattern on all such occasions.  No Principal or Teacher has a right to expel a student from  school without the action of the Academic Council.  GRADING OF DEPARTMENTS.  No student should be considered qualified to enter any depart- ment unless able to pursue successfully at least two of the studies  enumerative under "GRADING," in such department.  Primary Department.  GRADING. Chart Class to II Readers. Elementary Arithmetic,  as far as Division. Simple Lessons in Language.  CURRICULUM. Theology, Reading, Grammar and Composi- tion, Arithmetic, Geography, Penmanship, Orthography, Drawing,  Object Lessons, Singing, Ladies' Work, and Calisthenics.  Preparatory Department.  GRADING. III and IV Readers. Arithmetic, Numbers to end  of Fractions. Graded Lessons in English. 
 CURRICULUM. Theology, Reading, Grammar and Composi- tion, Arithmetic, Geography, Penmanship, Orthography, Drawing,  Singing, Elementary Natural History, Hygiene, Ladies' Work,  Calisthenics.  Intermediate Department.  GRADING. V Readers and Elocution. Pract. Arith., Com- pound Nos. to end of text-book. Higher Lessons in English.  CURRICULUM. (Obligatory:) Theology, Grammar and Com- position, Reading, Arithmetic, Physical or Descriptive Geography,  Orthography, Penmanship, Ladies' Work (for lady students), U.  S. History and Hygiene.  Optional: Vocal Music, Elementary Book-keeping.  Text-books and books of reference used: Bible, Book of Mor- mon, Doctrine and Covenants, School Dictionary.  Text-books in the Primary, Preparatory and Intermediate  Departments should be wherever possible those adopted officially in  the District Schools of the respective Stake or County, in order to  avoid unnecessary expenses to the pupils.  Academic Department.  Church Schools, properly authorized to conduct academic  classes, or to organize Academic Departments, will be guided by  the instructions regarding academic courses and branches.  Suggestive Plan for the Theological Course.  Students should be graded according to age, Church standing  and previous training in Theology. Thus it may happen that  students of the Preparatory or Intermediate grades be entered in  the Academic class in Theology, and vice versa.  Primary: Simple stories from the Bible, the Book of Mormon  and Church History.  Preparatory: Life of Christ, Acts of the Apostles, and Book  of Mormon History.  Intermediate: Selections from Doctrine and Covenants, Book  of Mormon, and synopsis of the books of the Bible.  Academic: A systematic and somewhat exhaustive study of the  principles and ordinances of the Gospel as arranged in the Compen- 
 dium, alternating with Church History and Book of Mormon  Chronology. Students should be supplied with the standard works  of the Church. The Authorities have in contemplation the issu- ance of a special work for use in Academic theological classes.  Besides daily recitations on the above subjects.  Devotional Exercises should be held morning and evening:  General Repetition Classes should be held weekly, and the stu- dents divided into small quorums to review the past week s work in  Theology.  Priesthood Meetings should be organized to hear repetition re- ports and to acquaint the members more fully with the duties and  organization of the Priesthood.  A General Theological Class should be held weekly, in which  all departments should participate, and interesting programs be  rendered.  In all grades, however, it should be the main object of the  teachers to cultivate in the hearts of their pupils a living testimony  of the truth of the latter-day work.  THE DOMESTIC FEATURE OF OUR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM.  In regard to our Domestic Regulations, of such potent influence  in forming the character of the students, the Boards and Faculties  will consider the circumstances of their localities, and advance step  by step in the introduction of rules, which will assist them in the  accomplishment of the object of the glorious mission given to us  for the elevation of the youth of Zion. Such regulations should  not be fetters to obstruct the exercise of free agency, but stakes  to indicate the road to the attainment of the virtues of self-control  and sense of duty.  A leading feature of the Church School system is the cultiva- tion of the character and the control of the deportment of the stu- dent in and out of school. All students, on entering any of our  schools, should be placed upon their word of honor to observe con- scientiously the rules and regulations of the school. A bi-weekly  meeting should be held, in which the reports of visitors appointed  by the Principal should be received, and general instructions be given  pertaining to the behavior and well-being of the students.

 May 19th, [189]1.  President Wilford Woodruff,  President of the General Board of Education Of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints;  Dear Brother:  As you will see from the enclosed program, the Commencement Exercises of the Latter-day Saints' College for the Fifth Academic Year, will be held in the Social Hall on Thursday, May 21st, 1891, beginning at 11 A.M. It would affiord us the most sincere pleasure to be favored with your presence on that occasion, and we also extend through you an earnest invitation to any of the members of the General Board who can make it convenient to meet with us.

 May 23rd, 1891.  Presidents Woodruff and Cannon, Gardo House, City;  Dear Brethren: In accordance with your request, I have con- sulted with Brother Trejo regarding his position as teacher of Spanish, and the remuner- ation he would desire during the summer months. Not finding you at your office today, and expecting to leave for Europe to-morrow, I take this manner of reporting to you the results. My opinion of Brother Trejo's efficiency as a teacher, as also upon the success which has attended his labors with our students in Spanish, I have already expressed to you. He seems well satisfied with the arrangements of the past, in matters of salary. He dislikes the thought of having to abandon the work altogether, and return to unsuit- able labor for a livelihood, during the summer vacation, and says he would be well satis- fied with half pay until the next school year opens. This, I believe, covers the extent of the enquiries you directed me to make. I trust the answers will be satisfactory.  Thanking you for many kind assistances to me personally, and wishing you all pros- perity and peace in your great labors for and among the people of God,  I am, Very truly your brother, J. E. Talmage, per W. D. 
 Sept. 23rd, 1891.  President Wifordlford Woodruff and Counselors;  Dear Brethren: For two years the Theological class of our higher department has been favored with the services of Elder George Reynolds as instructor in Book of Mormon subjects. The interest displayed by the students in Elder Reynolds' teachings, and the good results of his efforts, have been strongly manifest. During the few weeks of the present academic year already elapsed, enquiries have been numerous as to the possibility of his resuming his valuable instructions. In a conversation between myself and Brother Reynolds, he stated his willingness to  continue his assistance to our Theological work, if such met the approval of the  Presidency.  I therefore take the liberty to respectfully ask your consideration of the matter, and should you deem it advisable to give to Elder Reynolds the time necessary for conducting a class once or twice a week, one of the most important branches of our Theological work will be greatly strengthened.  Trusting you will pardon my trespass on your time and attention by consid- ering the object of it, I am,  Very respectfully your Brother,  J. E. Talmage. 
 Oct. 7th, 1891.

First North, on Thursday, October 8th, at 10 a.m. It is the desire of all concerned that proper dedicatory services [2 illegible words] on the occasion, and should you or any of the Authorities [2 illegible words] possible to be present on the occasion, we should esteem your visit [illegible] great honor.  With earnest prayers for your welfare, and that of all who labor with you, I am,  Very truly, your brother,  Similar notifications were sent to John T. Woodbury, of Davis Stake Academy, and G. M. Munford, of 18th Ward Seminary.

 I had an Interview ^with several Pottowatamie chiefs, who came to su [us]^ between Joseph Smith & the Potowatamie chiefs me during my absence, and remained until the present  written by W Woodruff  Note from W Woodruffs Journal  Sevaral of the potawatamie Chiefs came to Nauvoo for the purpose of Having an interview with the Prophet Joseph Smith, at the time of their arival He had gone to Dixon upon a visit, was kidnaped, while there and efforts made to run him to Missouri "The Indians Chiefs ^who^ remain at Nauvoo untill the prophet returned & had his trial during their stay thay had a conv talk with Hiram Smith in the basement of the Nauvoo House. W Woodruff & some others were presant. they were not free to talk & did not wish to communicate their feelings untill they could see the great ^Prophet^ propheit. At length on the 2nd day of July 1843 President Joseph Smith ^& councollars & some of the 12^ met those Chiefs in the chamber of his store ^Court room^ with about 20 of the Elders the following is a synopsis of the conversation which took place as given by the interpeter who accompanid them. The Indian Orator arose & asked the prophet if those ^the^ men who ware present were all his Friends. Answer yes. He then said "we as a people have long been distressed and oppressd we have been driven from our lands many times we have been wasted away by wars untill there is ^are^ but few of us left the white man has hated us & shed our blood untill it has appeared as though their would soon be no Indian Left. we have talked with the great spirit & the great spirit has talked with us we have asked the great Spirit to save us & Let us live and the great spirit has told us that he had raised us up a great Prophet aChief & Friend unto us who woudld do us great good & tell us what to do and the great spirit has told us that you are the man (Pointing to the Prophet Joseph) we have now come a great ways to see you & to hear your words & to have you tell us what to do, Our Horses have become poor traveling & we are hungry, we will now wait & hear your word," the spirit of God rested upon the Lamanits esspecally the Orator who spoke Joseph was much eaffected & shed tears. He arose & said unto them "I have heard your words they are true, the great spirit has told you the truth, I am your friend & Brother & I wish to do you good your Fathers was ^were^ once a great people they worshipd the great spirit the Great spirit done ^did^ them good He was their friend but they left the great spirit & would not hear his words or 
 Keep them the great Spirit left them & they began to kill one another & thay have been poor & afflicted untill now. The great Spirit has given me a Book told me that you will soon be blessed again the great spirit will soon begin to talk with you & your children this is the book which your Fathers made & wrote upon it (showing them the book of Mormon) this tells what you will have to do. I now want you to begin to pray to the great spirit I want to have you ^to^ make peace with one another & do not kill any more Indians it is not good, do not kill white man it is not good but ask the great spirit for what you want. & it will not be long before the great spirit will bless you & you will cultivant the Earth & build god Houses like white man, we will give you somthig to eat & to take home with you."  whan the Prophets words were interpreted to the chiefs that all said it was good. The Chief asked "how many moons it would be before the great Spirit would bless them" he told them "not a great many." At the close of the interview Joseph had an ox killed for them & they were furnished with some more horses & they went home satisfyed & contented. There were many other things said by the chiefs & Prophet but the words I cannot now bring to mind to record  W. Woodruff

 616 THE DESERET NEWS Oct 12  DESERET NEWS: WEEKLY  TRUTH AND LIBERTY  PRINTED AND PUBLISHED BY THE DESERET NEWS COMPANY  CHARLES W. PENROSE, EDITOR.  WEDNESDAY, - Oct 12, 1887.  AN EPISTLE  To the Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- day Saints.     INTRODUCTORY.  Dear Brothers and Sisters:  It appears proper, at this Fifty-eighth Semi-annual Conference of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, that an epistle should be addressed to the members of the Church, in con- formity with the custom which has been observed at the past five General Conferences.  DEATH OF PRESIDENT TAYLOR.  As some of the Apostles are pre- vented, by circumstances well known to the Saints, from appearing in pub- lic, the Church will naturally look for some expression from them concern- ing their feelings and hopes respecting the work of our God. Especially at the present time is deep interest felt in the utterances of the Apostles, because of the loss which the Church has sus- tained in the death of PRESIDENT JOHN TAYLOR. Twice before has the Church mourned the death of its President, and each time the event has produced a profound impression upon its mem- bers. In this instance this sad event is invested with more significance than it would have been had it occurred in the ordinary way. President Taylor died in exile. For about two years and a half he had been compelled to live in seclusion, and to refrain from all public association with the people whom he loved more than he did life.  Through his decease the Church is called the third time to mourn the de- parture of the man who has stood as its President and as the Prophet, Seer and Revelator to this generation. The experience which the Saints have gained in passing through these trials has been of exceeding value to them. They have learned that God can take care of his own work, and that they need not worry nor yield to anxiety or doubt concerning its management.  After the martyrdom of the Prophet Joseph there were pretenders who as- serted that they had the right to take his place at the head of the Church. Some were deceived by their preten- sions, not being familiar with the or- der of the Priesthood.  THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE APOSTLES.  For some time before his death the Prophet Joseph was inspired of the Lord to anticipate his own departure from earthly scenes. This was shown in various ways; but especially in the great anxiety which he displayed to bestow upon the Twelve Apostles all the keys and authority of the Holy Priesthood which he had received. He declared in private and in public that they were equipped and fully qualified, and that he had rolled the kingdom of God on to the shoulders of the Twelve Apostles.  PRESIDENT WOODRUFF'S PERSONAL TESTIMONY.  I, Wilford Woodruff, being the last man living in the flesh who was pres- ent upon that occasion feel it a duty I owe to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, to the House of Israel, and to the whole world to bear this is my last testimony to all nations, that in the winter of 1843-4, Joseph Smith, the Prophet of God, called the Twelve Apostles together in the City of Nauvoo, and spent many days with us in giving us our endowments, and teaching us those glorious principles which God had revealed to him. And upon one occasion he stood upon his feet in our midst for nearly three hours declaring unto us the great and last dispensation which God had set His hand to perform upon the earth in these last days. The room was filled as if with consuming fire; the Prophet was clothed upon with much of the power of God, and his face shone and was transparently clear, and he closed that speech, never-to-be-forgotten in time or in eternity, with the following language:   Brethren, I have had great sorrow of heart for fear that I might be taken from the earth with the keys of the Kingdom of God upon me, without sealing them upon the heads of other men. God has sealed upon my head all the keys of the Kingdom of God necessary for organizing and build- ing up of the Church, Zion, and Kingdom of God upon the earth, and to prepare the Saints for the coming of the Son of Man. Now, brethren, I thank God I have lived to see the day that I have been enabled to give you your endowments, and I have now sealed upon your heads all the powers  of the Aaronic and Melchesidek Priest- hoods and Apostleship, with all the keys and powers thereof, which God has sealed upon me; and I know roll off all the labor, burden and care of this Church and Kingdom of God upon your shoulders, and I now command you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ to round up your shoulders, and bear off this Church and Kingdom of God before heaven and earth, and be- fore God, angels and men; and if you don't do it you will be damned.   And the same spirit that filled the room at that time burns in my bosom while I record this testimony, and the Prophet of God appointed no one else but the Twelve Apostles to stand at the head of the Church and direct its affairs.  THE PRESIDENCY IN THE APOSTLES.  When the Prophet Joseph had passed away by foul assassination, those who possessed the Spirit of God and were living in close communion with it, knew the voice of the true shepherd and were not deceived by the claims of men who pretended to have authority. The body of the Church followed the leadership of those whom God had chosen, and whom His ser- vant Joseph had been instructed to prepare for this great responsibility. The Twelve Apostles, with President Brigham Young as their head, became the presiding council of the Church.  The lessons which the Church then learned in regard to the Priesthood, and the rights of the Priesthood, have never been forgotten. When Presi- dent Young was taken from us, there was no jar nor division of sentiment among the Apostles; and among the people there was scarcely a question as to where the right of Presidency rest- ed. President John Taylor took the position which belonged to him, and the work of God moved forward with- out interruption, and with a union and harmony on the part of all connected with it, most delightful to wit- ness. He has stood at our head for nearly ten years, and during that period he has possessed the gifts and qualifications which belonged to his high office and calling. His entire career is one that can be contemplated with the utmost satisfaction and pleas- ure by all who love the truth and ad- mire integrity in those who are called to be servants of God. From the time that he was baptized a member of the Church until his spirit took its flight from earth, he never wavered in his ad- vocacy and defense of the principles of righteousness. Under all the varied circumstances through which he and the people of God were called to pass, in the midst of the deepest trials and afflictions, his voice was always raised in tones of encouragement and hope; and when the storms were the fiercest, he rose to the occasion and always displayed undaunted courage and un- flinching devotion to the Zion of God. In the providence of God it fell to his lot to be with the Prophet Joseph and Patriarch Hyrum when they were martyred for the truth, and he mingled his own blood with theirs. Though severely wounded on that occasion, he miraculously escaped death. He was a man whom the Lord loved. The evidence of this is to be found in the fact that He [c]hose him to preside over His Church at the departure of His servant Brigham. We feel thank- ful to God our Eternal Father that we have been permitted to live with and enjoy the society of President John Taylor and his fellow-laborers. Our assocation with him and the Presidents and Apostles who have gone before him into the spirit world, we esteem as a great honor. We take delight in anticipating the rejoicing that we shall have when we shall be permitted to mingle in their society.  Once more, the responsibility of presiding over the Church has fallen upon the Council of the Twelve Apostles. The Counselors of Presi- dent Taylor, Brothers George Q. Cannon and Joseph F. Smith, being members of the Council of the Twelve Apostles at the time they were chosen to be members of the First Presidency, have, since his death, taken their places again as members of that Council.  Fifty-seven years and a half have elapsed since the Church was organ- ized. In looking around among those with whom we associate to-day, how few there are left of those who, under the Lord, helped to lay . the foundation of this work and were the companions of the Prophet in the early labors connected therewith. To-day there is but one Apostle left of those who belonged to the Council of the Apostles during the lifetime of the Prophet Joseph, or, indeed, at the time these valleys were first settled. The other faithful Apostles who were ordained under the direction of the Prophet Joseph have all passed behind the veil. Since the death of President Young four have joined him in the other world, and in the same period six have been ordained as members of the Council of the Twelve Apostles. This gives some idea of the changes which are occurring, and how rapidly a new generation is taking an active part in the building up of Zion.  THE LABORS OF THE APOSTLES.  Those of us who have been at liberty to travel, have devoted our time to visiting the various Stakes, and in meeting with them at their Quarterly Conferences. Some of us have been laboring in Mexico, others in Arizona, besides visiting the Stakes in Idaho and in Utah. These Quarterly Con- ferences are attended with excellent results. The people come together and receive instructions and coun- sel upon leading topics, and much good is derived therefrom.  Though it involves considerable labor for the Apostles to visit them, yet we are encouraged in doing so by the ad- vantages which those visits bring to the people in keeping them informed concerning general movements and counsel. In these labors we have had much joy and satisfaction, especially in witnessing the increase of faithful- ness on the part of the Saints.  THE PATIENCE OF THE SAINTS.  Though many of the leading men have been compelled to be absent, some of them having been incarcer- ated in prison, the people have, never- theless, been steadfast, and have sought with increased dilligence to per- form their duties. The persecution to which they have been subjected has led the people to think and act for themselves, and not to depend so much upon others for guidance. This can not fail to be attended with good results. It is necessary that all the members of the Church should exer- cise their powers of reason and reflec- tion and thoroughly understand why they take the course which God points out. Intelligent obedience on the part of His Saints is desired by our Father in heaven. He has given us our agency to think and act for ourselves, on our own volition, to obtain a testimony for ourselves from Him concerning the truth of the principles which He teaches, and then be firm and unshaken in the performance of all which is necessary for salvation.  We have felt great satisfaction in witnessing the dignity and courage which the Saints have exhibited through the trials of the past three years. Their conduct has been ad- mirable. They have displayed great qualities. The forbearance, patience and fortitude which they have ex- hibited are proofs that God has been with them. Outrages which would have goaded any other people into acts of violence have been of frequent oc- currence. In other communities men and women would be desperate under such treatment. But the Lord has given His people power to control themselves and peace has been main- tained. Riots and bloodshed have been avoided, and even under strong provocation, when blood was shed, the community restrained itself. Preju- dice may prevent our nation and its rulers from acknowledging at the present, how noble the demeanor of the people has been under these trying circumstances, and with the strong provocations which they have had to indulge in outbreaks; yet the time will come when all this will receive its proper recognition and due credit will be ac- corded to the Latter-day Saints to their magnanimity and self-control through- out this entire persecution.  PRIMARY ASSOCIATIONS, ETC.  In the organizations which have been established among our people in all our settlements in these moun- tains, the advancement and training and benefit of all classes are amply provided for. Among no people of whom we know anything have such provisions been made for the salvation and care of the members of society of all ages as among the Latter-day Saints. If we and our children do not progress in intelligence and in the knowledge of all principles pertaining to life here and life hereafter, it is be- cause we do not avail ourselves of those facilities which are placed within our reach. We have the Primary As- sociations provided for the benefit of the young children of our Church, and their instruction in those simple prin- ciples which they can understand. We also have Sunday schools for the training and education of those of larger growth. In them they can learn the doctrines of salvation and the his- tory of the work of God, and be pre- pared for greater progress. Then we have the Young Mens  and Young Ladies  Mutual Improvement Asso- ciations, which have been organized, as their names imply, for the development of the young people of both sexes and their advancement in every thing that will qualify them for lives of useful- ness and honor. But besides these or- ganizations we have the various coun- cils of the Priesthood, to some office in which every young man who is worthy can be ordained. The young women, as they increase in years, can also find a sphere of usefulness in the Relief Societies which have been or- ganized for the purposes of assisting the Bishops and Counselors and Teachers of the Wards in caring for the poor and relieving the wants of the suffering and distressed. So that by means of these organizations, which are of vast interest to us as a people, every one from early childhood to ma- turity, can be led forward step by step, from one degree of knowledge to an- other until fully qualified to discharge all the duties of perfevted and honor- able manhood and womanhood.  So far as we know the sisters who have charge of the Primary Associa- tion are doing a most commendable work in arousing interest in the lit- tle ones and in teaching them in simple style those lessons which are adapted to their under- standings. We hope that in all our settlements these associations will re- ceive the constant care and attention of our wise and judicious sisters. The seed sown in the hearts of the children by the instructions imparted there will produce in years to come an abundant harvest that will gladden the hearts of the Saints who witness it.  OUR SUNDAY SCHOOLS, ETC.  The progress of the Sunday School cause in Zion continues satisfactory, though undoubtedly somewhat re-  tarded by the enforced absence from its labors and associations of so many brethren and sisters who have in former years taken an active interest in its welfare. We notice, with pleas- ure, the constantly increasing number of schools, teachers and scholars re- ported by the officers of the Union and the evident care taken by the presiding local authorities in our settlements to have a Sunday School as one of the first institutions established. We are also gratified to learn that in most of the foreign missions of the Church Sunday Schools and Improvement Associations are being organized wherever practicable. In Great Britain, in Con- tinental Europe, in New Zealand, and in the Sandwich Islands, as also in the branches scattered throughout the missions in the United States, these institutions are found contributing their influence in instructing and forming the character of the children of the Latter-day Saints.  The Mutual Improvement Societies are also accomplishing great good throughout our settlements. In connec- tion with them and the Sunday Schools, we desire to remind our brethren and sisters who are engaged in the praise- worthy labor of fostering these insti- tutions, that the original design in organizing Sunday Schools and Im- provement Societies among us was, that the children and youth of the Saints should be made wise in the principles of the Gospel and their faith be developed in the revelations of God. This the officers and teachers should keep constantly in mind. The books used should be almost without exception, the reveleations of God as contained in ancient and modern Scripture, together with the other works of the Church. The teachings, while direct, brief and simple, should be such as will increase the faith, de- velop the veneration and love, and draw out the intelligence of the youth- ful bearers toward the divine princi- ples of which by God's grace, we have been made the custodians. All at- tempts, however slight, to secularize these institutions and to change them so that they will not accomplish the ends sought for in their creation, should be discountenanced. The spirit and teachings of the Gospel should hold undivided control in all our ministrations connected with this cause. In the theological and other classes all discussions should be avoided as much as possible on sub- jects which God in His wisdom has not yet fully revealed. We know there are many persons who appear to take more delight in dwelling upon questions which are mysterious and cannot very well, in our present stae of knowl- edge, be answered than they do upon those subjects which are plain and simple and essential to present pro- gress. But the Lord has revealed so much that we can understand and that we ought to learn in order to be useful in the labors devolving upon us here, that we need not enter into discussions on subjects which [in] no way affect our happi[n]ess here or eter- nal salvation hereafter. In our theo- logical classes, quorum meetings and othe assemblies, therefore, these de- batable questions need not be dis- cussed or be dwelt upon to occupy the time of the members, to the exclusion of more profitable topics. In the Primary Associations, the Sunday schools and the Mutual Improvement Associations, singing should receive a large share of attention. Singing ex- ercises can be made a great attraction and also a valuable addition to the ed- ucation of the young. The interest that is now taken among us in vocal and instrumental music is a marked feature of the times, and this taste finds increasing opportunities for its development in the facilities which are now being furnished to all who desire its cultivation. Instead of having a select few act as choirs in these institutions to do the singing for the whole, the voices of all should be united in harmonious melody in giving utterance to the feelings of their hearts in hymns and songs. This will increase the pleasure of the meet- ings, and make all feel that they have an equal interest in worship and re- joicing.  THE RELIEF SOCIETIES.  The mission of the Relief Societies as organized among us, is truly grand and beneficent. There is no limit to their labors and usefulness while suf- fering and want exist in our midst. To aid the needy by feeding the hungry and clothing the destitute is distinc- tively and peculiarly their mission. In the energetic performance of their duty human sympathy and divine mercy are beautifully harmonized. In extending relief to the poor, the love of God and of our fellows is clearly manifest. It is more praiseworthy for a relief society to be able to say  There are none in our Ward in need of food, raiment or shelter,  than to report thousands of dollars in hand, while the needs of the poor are un- supplied.  These societies have done a vast amount of good among us, and the members have been of greate service in assisting the Priesthood in the wards in caring for the destitute and in sup- plying the wants of those who have been in need of help. In these labors we desire to give them every encour- agement and to invoke the blessing of heaven upon them, and all their exer- tions for the benefit of suffering hu- manity.  THE CARE OF THE POOR.  As the winter season is approaching, it is proper that each Bishop and his Counselors should take the necessary  steps to properly care for the poor who live in their wards. They should call the Relief Societies to their aid in this labor. The reasonable wants of the poor should be supplied and the pangs of poverty and destitation should be averted. God has greatly blessed us in the fruits of our fields and gardens, in our flocks and herds, and in giving us comfortable habita- tions and means to sustain ourselves, and we should always remember the words of the Apostle James:  Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, to visit the father- less and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.   While it has always been the policy of our people to encourage in- dustry and to repress idleness to every form, and to expect all persons to contribute, according to their ability, to their own support; still there are many cases where the aged and the in- firm, or the unfortunate, cannot, with the utmost exertion and economy, ob- tain through their own labors suffi- cient to sustain themselves. It would be a great evil among us to encourage any class in living upon the benevo- lence of the community. No system of begging should be permitted. Those able to work should be fur- nished employment. Persons who are properly disposed will be glad to ob- tain it in preference to being fed with the bread of charity; and all should be encouraged to labor according to their strength. This policy, if wisely pursued will prevent pauperism, de- velop self exertion and confidence, and produce self-respect. It is a cause of great pleasure to think that beg- gary is unknown throughout our set- tlements. There is no need for any- one, however destitute, to publicly solicit alms. But while this is the case, the sensitive and those who shrink from asking aid, who conceal in some instances, their poverty, should be carefully looked after by the Relief Societies under the direction of the Bishops of the wards, so that there may be no individual in any of our wards suffering for the want of food or any other article necessary to sustain or preserve life. The community whose hearts are open to the cries of distress, who are ready to administer of the substance which the Lord gives them to relieve their fellow creatures, may always depend upon the favor of the Lord, for he loves those who are kind to their fellow-men, and who admin- ister to their necessities, whose hearts are tender, and who readily respond to applications of this character which are made upon them, or who antici- pate them by giving freely to the desti- tute.  FAST OFFERINGS.  In some of our wards there is not proper care taken in the collection of the fast offerings of the people. The first Thursday in the month has been set apart in the Church as a day of fasting and prayer. That day should be strictly observed. Fast offerings should be brought with a liberal hand to the Bishop of each ward, that he may be prepared to supply those who are dependent upon the ward for su- stenance. Some wards require consid- erable aid from the Church to help sustain their poor, because their own fast offerings do not supply them; while sometimes in the same Stake there are other wards where there are few, if any, dependent poor. Presidents of Stakes should make arrangements with the Bishops of the last named wards to transfer their fast offerings to the Bishop of some contiguous ward which has more poor within its borders than its own fast offerings will supply. In this way all the peo- ple can have an equal opportunity of doing their duty to the poor.  THE LESSONS OF LIBERALITY.  Experience has abundantly proved that those who are attentive to those and all other duties required by the Lord receieve His blessing. God does bless those who devote themselves with singleness of purpose to His work. If proof of this were needed, one has only to notice the condition of Elders in the various settlements who have spent years of their lives upon missions. Though their home affairs may have been left to the care of their wives and children, they are not dis- tinguished by their poverty from their fellow-servants who have remained at home.  We have only to look around us to satisfy ourselves also, that those who are generous in contributing to God's work are favored of the Lord. This was the experience of ancient Israel, and it is our experience. Yet in re- gard to voluntary donations there is too much carelessness, not withstand- ing all the precious promises con- nected therewith. The Saints should be reminded of the obligation which rests upon them. Our children, also, should be taught this duty, that it may become a fixed habit with them to punctually attend to these matters. Those who have strictly observed these requirements can testify to the great pleasure and many rewards they have received from their observance.  This law of liberality appears to be one of the safeguards which the Lord has adopted to avert from his people the evil consequences which follow the possession of wealth. He has told us that the riches of the earth are His to give; but He has warned us to be- ware of pride, lest we become as the Nephites of old. We know the ruin it wrought for them, and we should spare no precaution to prevent wealth having a disastrous effect upon us. Many can endure poverty and be hum- ble and live near the Lord who cannot bear riches. They become lifted up to 
 Oct. 12 THE DESERT NEWS 617  pride and become covetous, and for- get their God. Those, however, who remember constantly the teachings of the Lord concerning the earth and its inhabitants, and who contribute of the means which the Lord [ink splot] [g]ives them to assist the poor and help carry forward the work of God, exercise a check upon themselves and give Satan less power to lead them astray. Under the pres- ent system of affairs, those who ac- cumulate wealth and are able to sup- ply themselves and their families with luxuries and advantages that are de- nied their neighbors, are in danger of becoming separated from the bulk of the people and forming a distinct class. But the day will come when a more perfect order will be introduced. Then it will be said there are no poor and no rich in Zion that is, we shall not be divided into classes, but shall all possess everything of this charac- ter necessary for our comfort and hap- piness. But until then, if we wish our families and ourselves to remain Lat- ter-day Saints, we must be especially careful to guard against the deceitful- ness of riches.  THE DUTIES OF THE SAINTS.  The great labor which devolves upon us, as members of the Church, is to build up Zion. God has founded Zion, and we should seek to extend its bene- fits and blessings until all mankind. It should be our constant care to do nothing that will weaken its influence or power or retard its growth in the earth. This we should constantly im- press also, upon our children, that they may grow up filled with an abid- ing love for the work of God.  There has been too much neglect on this point. Many have pursued a short-sighted, selfish policy; and have worked to that which they believed was their own individual advantage without regard to the effect their ac- tion would have upon the work of God. Their eyes have not been single to His glory. Such a disposition has proved a snare to those who have indulged in it; they have wrought injury to them- selves, not to mention the effect their conduct has had upon Zion.  THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF MARRIAGE.  The Lord has informed us that mar- riage is ordained of God unto man. The instutition of marriage, in some communities of which we read, is fall- ing almost into disrepute. It is al- leged that there is a growing tendency in this direction among us. The cause is doubtless, traceable to the in- crease of wealth and the dis- inclination of young men to take upon them the burdens of a wife and family. As we depart from the sim- plicity of early days, we may naturally expect that this tendency will increase as young men may be restrained from offering marriage to young ladies un- less they can give them something like as comfortable a home as they enjoy under their parents' roof. Extrava- gant or luxuriant habits or training on the part of the girls will also have the effect to deter young men from marry- ing. Care should be taken by every person of influence to conteract this tendency, and to set before the rising generation the advantages which fol- low well-arranged marriages. No community can prosper and maintain a high standard of morality where there is a large percentage of unmar- ried young men and young women. We should deplore the increase of such a class among us, and all honor- able means should be used to prevent its existence. The young of both sexes should be taught that it is not necessary to happiness in marriage to be in the possession of wealth. In this country an industrious, economi- cal married couple can soon surround themselves with all the conveniences and comforts essential to life and hap- piness. The satisfaction each will have in after years in the enjoyment of the fruits of their joint industry and thrift will amply repay them for any in- conveniences or privations they may have been subjected to in the early days of their married life. The com- forts thus accumulated will be doubly sweeted unto them by the recollec- tion of their exertions in common to procure them. No rightly constituted and educated young woman will refuse an offer of marriage from a worthy, in- dustrious young man for no other rea- son than that he is not able to surround her at first with the comforts which she may think she ought to have. Young men who have a due share of the qualities which women esteem in a husband need not be afraid that girls of that kind will refuse them, because they may not be well endowed with this world's goods. They will cheer- fully bear their part of the burdens of life without repining when confident of the love and supporting and guiding hand of their husbands.  AGAINST INCURRING DEBT.  We feel led to caution the Latter- day Saints against forming the bad habit of incurring debt and taking upon themselves obligations which fre- quently burden them heavier than they can bear, and lead to the loss of their homes and other possessions. We know it is the fashion of the age to use credit to the utmost limit, and it is custom- ary for nations, states, counties and cities to borrow money, issue bonds and thus load themselves with taxes to such an extent that large numbers of the people are prevented from own- ing land or even the houses which they occupy. Thus the masses become ten- tants and have to pay rent for land and shelter. This is a great evil and one that we, as a people and as individuals, should carefully shun. Our business should be done, as much as possible, on the principle of paying for that  which we purchase, and our needs should be brought within the limit of our resources. The disposition to speculate and to take chances upon ventures of one kind and another should be repressed. There are many people who have been rendered home- less in our Territory by the neglect of this precaution. To raise funds to in- vest in some scheme which has ap- peared promising they have mortgaged their homes, only too often, to be dis- appointed and to find themselves with- out a place of shelter for themselves and their families. All this is wrong. If the penalty for such unwisdom fell upon the one who through those acts and influence it is brought about the con- sequences would not be so deplorable; but very frequently families suffer and the bad results are widely felt. We, therefore, repeat our counsel to the Latter-day Saints, to shun debt. Be content with mod- erate gains, and be not misled by illu- sory hopes of acquiring wealth. Re- member the saying of the wise man:  But he that hasteth to get rich shall not be innocent.  Let our chil- dren also be taught habits of economy, and not to indulge in tastes which they cannot gratify without running in debt.  ZION SHALL NOT BE REMOVED.  We have been favored, as no other people have, with wise counsels. Their extent and variety are immeas- urable. They cover every department of human life. So far as we have ob- served them, prosperity and happiness have been the results. Whatever difficulties we may have to contend with to-day are due, if not wholly, at least in great part, to our disregard of them. Is not this the experience and testimony of all the faithful Saints who have watched the progress of events among us? Had we observed these counsels, how many of the evils from which we now suffer would never have been known among us. Our neglect of them has brought its punishment, and the faithful can see it. But shall we not profit by the ex- perience of the past and act more wise- ly in the future? As the Lord has said (Doctrine and Covenants, sec. 90, ver. 36[ ]37).   But verily I say unto you, that I, the Lord, will contend with Zion, and plead with her strong ones, and chasten her until she overcomes and is clean before me: For she shall not be removed out of her place, I, the Lord, have spoken it.   We should begin to understand that God's ways are infinitely superior to our ways, and that His counsels, though they may seem to call for sacrifice, are always the best and the safest for us to adopt and carry out. Thousands among us can testify to the truth of this from individual experi- ence. These thousands should com- bine and create a public opinion in fa- vor of obedience to the counsel of heaven that will have its proper effect upon our children and the inexperi- enced among us.  THE GLORY WILL BE THE LORD'S.  We also should learn this great truth, that God will have all the glory and honor for the establishment of His Church and Kingdom on the earth. Man cannot claim it in this or any other age of the world. Nothing but the power of God could have brought forth the fullness of the Gos- pel, organized the Church, gathered His people to Zion in fulfillment of revelation and performed the work which has been accomplished. There- fore, as Latter-day Saints, we are obliged to acknowledge the hand of God in all the blessings we enjoy.  THE CONDUCT OF OUR LIVES.  It should be the aim of all the mem- bers of the Church to carry out prac- tically in their lives the principles of the Gospel. In no way can we better convince the world of their truth than in showing in our acts and dealings with one another and with mankind the elevating effect they have upon us. We make high profes- sions, and there should be such a high standard of purity of life among us as to correspond with these professions. Our children should be impressed with this, and be taught that the name of Saint is so holy that they only who are pure in heart can claim it.  If our religion does not lead us to love our God and our fellow man and to deal justly and uprightly with all men, then our profession of it is vain. The Apostle says:   If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother, whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?   We can best exemplify our love for our God by living our religion. It is vain to profess a love for God while speaking evil of or doing wrong to His children. The sacred covenants we have made with Him strictly impose upon us the duties we owe to one another; and the great office of religion is to teach us how to perform those duties so as to produce the greatest happiness for ourselves and for our fellow-beings. When the obligations of our religion are observed, no words are spoken or acts are committed that would injure a neighbor. If the Lat- ter-day Saints lived as they should do, and as their religion teaches them to do, there would be no feeling in any breast but that of brotherly and sisterly affection and love. Backbiting and evil-speak- ing would have no existence among us; but peace and love and good will would reign in all our hearts and hab- itations and settlements. We would be the happiest people on the face of the earth, and the blessing, and peace  of Heaven would rest upon us and upon all that belongs to us.  If there be unhappiness and heart- burnings and quarrelings and hatreds among us, they exist because we do not observe the religion which we pro- fess. They are not its fruits. Where these evils exist there is a crying ne- cessity for repentance. If any feel in- jured by the words or acts of their brethren or sisters, the Gospel points out and furnishes the way by which this injury may be repaired. Instead of talking about this to others they should go to the person or persons who have done the wrong and make their feelings known. If satisfaction is then made, that ought to end the matter; but if not, it can be reported to the proper officers of the Church for them to take the necessary steps to terminate the difficulties. In this way animosities and disunion can be pre- vented and confidence be maintained.  PARTAKING OF THE SACRAMENT.  As Latter-day Saints, it is our gen- eral custom to partake of the sacrament once a week. If the teachings of our Lord, in remembrance of whom we observe this sacred ordinance, be regarded, no one who has trespassed can be per- mitted to share in it until he has made reconciliation. It is the express com- mandment of the Lord Jesus that no one shall be permitted to partake of His flesh and blood unworthily. A more perfect system to prevent the existence of improper feelings and wrongs, among brethren and sisters can not be imagined. If the Saints do their duty, difficulties do not remain unsettled beyond the Lord's day when they assemble to eat and drink in re- membrance of Him.  TEMPLE WORK.  Notwithstanding the difficulties that the Saints have had to contend with of late, they have pursued their labors in every direction with unabated zeal. This is particularly noticable in their attendance at the Temples. The wish to avail themselves of the opportuni- ties for attending to the ordinances for themselves and their deceased friends has, if anything, increased, and those employed in these sacred buildings have their time fully occupied in per- forming their duties there. It is evi- dent that the Latter-day Saints ap- preciate the blessings to be obtained through this Temple work. When we reflect that we have two buildings of this character already completed, furnishing abundant facilities for all who choose to go there to obtain the ordinances of God's house for themselves and for those in whose salvation they take so deep an interest, and that we have another Temple at Manti nearing com- pletion, and one in Salt Lake City, which we hope to see finished before long, our hearts are filled with glad- ness and we cannot refrain from prais- ing our God for His goodness unto His people in permitting them, notwith- standing the oppositions and many dif- ficulties they have had to contend with, to erect such structures and to dedicate them, according to the pat- tern He has given for these sacred uses.  No right feeling Latter-day Saint can think upon this subject without being thrilled with heavenly joy for what God has done for us in our gener- ation, furnishing us, as He has done, with every facility to prepare us, our posterity and our ancestors for that eternal world which lies beyond the present life. The Latter-day Saints are, in truth, a highly favored people, and praise to God should ascend from every heart and habitation in our land for the great mercy and goodness which He has shown unto us. He has made us promises of the most precious character, and he has fulfilled them up to the present time. We would be the most ungrateful and unworthy people that ever lived if, after receiving such wonderful manifestations of His good- ness, we slackened in our diligence or nailed in our obedience and devotion to Him and His great cause.  FOREIGN MISSIONS.  The treatment which the Elders have received in preaching the Gospel throughout the Southern States, as we are informed by President John Morgan, has been much better of late than it has been at some other periods. The Elders are listened to with more patience and do not meet with so much of the spirit of mobocracy and un- reasoning hate. Additions are being made to the Church, and those who emigrate from that region have gener- ally settled in San Luis Valley, Colo- rado.  The Elders in the North Western States under the direction of President W. M. Palmer, pursue their labors with undiminished zeal and with mod- erate success in bringing people into the Church. These fields of labor have furnished opportunities for num- bers of our young men to gain experi- ence in missionary efforts, and those who have this privilege return home, in the most of instances, better quali- fied to assist the local authorities where they reside in the labors of the ministry.  In Great Britain the Elders meet with considerable opposition in places, principally, however, from apostates. They find that field a much more dif- ficult one than it was in former years. The hearts of the people seem to have become hardened, and great indiffer- ence prevails in regard to religion. Still we learn from President George Teasdale, who presides at the present time over the European Mission, that the Elders who zealously enter into  the labors of the ministry and abund- ant cause for rejoicing in the success which attends their exertions. Throughout the Swiss and German Mission presided over by Elder Fred- erick Schoenfeld, and the Scandina- vian Mission presided over by Elder N. C. Flygare, the Elders are laboring also with commendable zeal and with gratifying results. An effort is being made at the present time to preach the Gospel in Turkey, where Elders Jacob Spori, J. M. Tanner and F. F. Hintze have been, and are laboring, and even the land of Palestine has been visited, and in the late company of emigrants which reached this City from Europe, nine persons were gathered who had received the Gospel in that land, a land hallowed to us as the earthly home of our Redeemer, and the soil of which his sacred feet trod.  On the Sandwich Islands the Elders are laboring faithfully under the direc- tion of President William King, and everything is being done to improve the condition of that people and to save them from the destruction which threatens the extinction of the race. The plantation at Lale is still main- tained, and the Elders who have la- bored and who are still laboring there enter with spirit into the management of that property in a way to benefit as much as possible the native Saints. The attention of the Elders there is di- rected at present to the Navigator Islands, where some few years ago two native Elders from the Sandwich Islands were successful in baptizing a large number of natives and organizing them into branches. These Islands have not been visited by any of the white Elders, but it is probably that some of our Elders on the Sandwich Islands may in the near future make a visit there.  The letters which we receive from New Zealand where Presi- dent William Paxman presides, continue to bring us gratifying intelli- gence concerning the condition and progress of the work there. The Elders are very successful among the Maories. Many of the white brethren have succeeded in acquiring the lan- guage of that race, which is cognate to that of the Sandwich Islands, and two of them, Elders Ezra T. Richards and Sondra Sanders, Jr. are now en- gaged, we are informed, in translating the Book of Mormon into the Maori language. In Australia the Elders are also laboring, but it is a much harder field than among the natives of New Zealand.  HOME MANUFACTURES.  Frequent reference has been made in past teachings and in former Epistles to the subject of home manufactures. It has been, and we feel it still ought to be, a theme of inexhaustible inter- est to Zion; yet there remains an im- mense amount to be done in develop- ing our resources and furnishing facil- ities for the employment of the people. It is pleasing to note the progress which is being made in some direc- tions. Our woolen manufactures are gaining credit for their excellence in other communities as well as our own. But we export considerable wool even after all our factories are well sup- plied. If this could be manufactured at home, it would add greatly to the wealth of our community, not only in the profits which would accrue from the use of machinery, but in the employ- ment which it would furnish to many of our citizens. Besides the manufac- ture of woolen clothes, there is con- siderable home-made hosiery of excel- lent quality which is placed on the market.  The range of articles which are manufactured in this Territory is gradually increasing; and from the feeling which now prevails we judge that many more branches will soon be added to those already in operation. The manufacture of soaps of various grades has now become a settled and paying business. A fine quality of hats is also made. Boots and shoes and clothing, glass, white lead, lead pipe, native paints, brushes, paper, printing type, starch, pearl barley and oatmeal are all manu- factured in the Territory, and many o[f] these articles in sufficient quantities to supply the local demand and to ex- port to some extent. It is an encour- aging feature in the most of these en- terprises that those engaged in them are seeking to enlarge their facilities with the view to increase their produc- tion. We have a large number of children growing up among us who should be furnished with opportuni- ties to acquire skill to mechanism, manufactures, and other pursuits which are necessary for the comfort of man. It is not only incumbent upon parents to seek for avenues of prof- itable employment for their children, but it should be kept in view by the leading men of the Church in all our settlements. An idle man's brain, it is said, is the devil's workshop, and no community can propser and main- tain a high standard of morality that does not furnish employment for its members. Far better to work for low wages than not to work at all. But with proper care, and by putting in use the experience that many individ- uals in every settlement possess, there need be no want of remunerative em- ployment for the rising generation, and for others who may come in from abroad. It may not always be kept in mind, yet it is a fact, that any per- centage of idle persons in a commu- nity is a direct loss to the whole. It is unfortunate, also, for a community, when the young and enterprising are compelled to leave it and go elsewhere to find employment or room for the exercise  of the talent of which they feel them- selves possessed. Settlements that are in this situation will languish and go to decay, while others that furnish facilities for employment will become thrifty and prosperous. The combi- nation of capital by means of co-op- eration would, in many instances, en- able settlements to start branches of manufacture and conduct them suc- cessfully. Chimerical schemes, how- ever, should not be encouraged, as their failure destroys confidence and makes it more difficult to obtain aid for worthy enterprises which might be made successful. Where co-opera- tion has failed among us, it has not been because the principle is defect- ive, but because of mismanagement, sometimes from ignorance and care- lessness, and sometimes, perhaps, from selfishness.  Our country abounds in useful ele- ments. We have a fertile soil, when properly cultivated, and an admirable climate. Grains, fruits, and vegeta- bles, as well as all kinds of stock, can be raised here, and as superior in quality as can be found anywhere on the earth. Care should be taken to raise the very best varieties. Our horses, cattle, sheep, and poultry, as well as our grains, and fruits, and vegetables, should be of the very best kinds, and no pains should be spared to keep them pure. Our sys- tem of irrigation does not admit of the cultivation of large areas of land. Our farms are moderate in ex- tent. This being the case, they should be cultivated in the most approved style, and the whole business con- nected in a manner to bring the best results. As facilities for education increase, there undoubtedly will be a marked improvement in the manage- ment of all these branches of busi- ness.  PRACTICAL EDUCATION.  It is gratifying to notice the interest that is being taken among us in educa- tion; yet there is great room for im- provement. As the taste for what may be called book-learning increases, manual labor should not be neglected. The education of the mind and the education of the body should go hand in hand. A skillful brain should be joined with a skillful hand. Manual labor should be dignified among us and always be made honorable. The tendency, which is too common in these days, for young men to get a smattering of education and then think themselves unsuited for mechanical or other laborious pur- suits is one that should not be allowed to grow among us. Of course it is necessary as society is now organized, that the professions, as they are termed, should receive attention. But every one should make it a matter of pride to be a producer, and not a consumer alone. Our children should be taught to sustain themselves by their own industry and skill, and not only to do this, but to help sustain others, and that to do this by honest toil is one of the most honorable means which God has furnished to his children here on the earth. The sub- ject of the proper education of the youth of Zion is one of the greatest importance.  President Brigham Young during his lifetime established schools in Provo and Logan, where the principles of the Gospel have been taught in connection with the other branches of education, and more recently similar schools have been commenced, and conducted with marked success; in Salt Lake, Beaver and Fillmore Cities.  The good results arising from teach- ings received in the Provo and Logan Academies are very apparent and pleasing to all who have the interests of the young at heart, and we regret that such institutions are so limited in number.  Through the indefatigable labors of Professors Karl G. Maeser, J. Z. Stew- art and their associates, these schools have done, and are now doing, a great work in educational advancement, by instilling a knowledge of the princi- ples of the Gospel of life and salva- tion into the minds of our children, upon whose shoulders the Kingdom of God must rest in the near future.  We trust it will not be long before schools of this kind will be established in every city and village where the Latter-day Saints reside. In the meantime, however, the Saints should not fail to avail themselves of the privileges that are now offered them in the Provo, Logan, Beaver, Fillmore, and Salt Lake Academies.  THE  CHURCH SUITS.   Congress at its last session as you are aware, passed a law entitled  An Act to amend an Act entitled an Act to amend Section 5352 of the Revised Statues of the United States, in refer- ence to bigamy, and for other pur- poses,  etc.  Under the 15th and 17th sections of this law the Perpetual Emigrating Fund Company and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are respectively declared dissolved, and in this Act it is made the duty of the Attorney General of the United States to cause proceedings to be taken in the Supreme Court of the Territory of Utah to wind up the affairs of said as- sociations.  Pursuant to the duty thus imposed upon the Attorney General, on the 30th day of July, 1887, proceedings were be- gun in said court by the United States against the Perpetual Emigrating Fund Company and its trustees, and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and its alleged trustees for the  (Continued on Page 624.) 
 624 THE  (Continued from page 617.)  purpose of disposing of the property of the one and winding up the affairs of the other: asking in these suits to escheat to the United States large amounts of property alleged to be held by these two defendants. At the time of this writing nothing has been done in these cases further than to appear and an- swer these complaints. What the result of these cases will be, we, of course cannot now say. It is proper, how- ever, that we should speak upon this important proceeding and let the Saints know how the cases stand.  The Perpetual Emigrating Fund Company, as all of you well know, was conceived and organized for but one purpose, namely, to aid the poor of our people in their humble efforts to gather with their brethren. It has been for this charitable purpose, the object of the generous bounty of the Latter-day Saints, but at no time in its history has it owned any real es- tate, or any personal property, save sufficient for its absolute needs each succeeding year. The Church on the other hand has been the owner of property, the gifts and bequests of an earnest, sincere people, made for the purpose of aiding in the propacation of the Gospel of our Savior Jesus Christ. The effort now being made by our government to dissolve or wind up these associations and escheat their property, is the first of the kind in that history of our people, and is believed to be without histori- cal precedent in this country. When we say we shall watch these cases with deep interest, the Saints will readily believe that it is not alone for the property involved in these suits, but also for the principles and rights that are at stake.  OUR SETTLEMENTS IN ARIZONA.  The intelligence which reaches us from our settlements in Arizona is en- couraging; and we note with pleasure that the people of the settlements at St. Johns and Woodruff have conquered some of the difficulties with which they had to content, and which made their position very trying. Indeed, the news from all the Stakes there is gratifying.  IN IDAHO.  In Idaho, though our people pay taxes and support the schools, every- one of our faith is denied the privilege of acting in the capacity of a school trustee or teacher, and no one with our belief can take the test oath that has been prescribed by the Legislature. The situation of the people there is one that excites great sympathy. They are practically denied the rights of American citizens through the infa- mous test oath law which was enacted by the Legislature. It is very trying to their patience and bears heavily up- on them. But the day must come when they will be relieved from the operation of this infamous law.  IN COLORADO.  In San Luis Valley, Colorado, the efforts of our people to open and cul- tivate farms, and to surround them- selves with the necessaries and com- forts of life, are meeting with gratify- ing success. This is the more note- worthy because of the fact that the great bulk of settlers there have not had experience in battling with the difficulties that have to be met in the building up of new settlements in an untried soil and climate. Like the Saints in Wyoming, those who reside in Colorado have always received fair treatment and encouragement and kind consideration from their neigh- bors and the officials of the State.  IN MEXICO.  Our settlements in Mexico are pro- gressing favorably and are gradually being strengthened, both at Diaz and Juarez. At the places named and in the Sierra Madre Mountains near the latter, we have nearly one hundred and fifty thousand acres [al[l grazing, timber and agricultural lands.  The country is well adapted to stock- raising, as the grasses are of good quality and great variety, while the climate is uniform, the temperature seldom reaching higher than 85 degrees or lower than an approach to the freezing point. The facilities for making comfortable homes there are excellent, the land, water and timber being good. A fine steam saw, shingle and lath mill, and a planer and moulder, are in operation, affording building material within easy reach of Juarez.  The treatment of our people by the national and state officials in Mexico and her citizens generally, has been cordial and hospitable. By word and act they have encouraged colonization in the Republic. The settlements in Chihuahua afford abundance of room for several hundred families and they could live there in peace, and by ordin- ary habits of industry would soon make themselves prosperous and happy.  The Mexican Mission was opened in 1870, and the Church now has quite a large following of native Saints, mainly located in and about the national cap- ital. The Book of Mormon, Voice of Warning, and numerous pamphlets have been published in the Spanish language and are being distributed ac- cording to ancient predictions. Thus the truth is being spread abroad among the seed of Israel through the means of the record of their fathers, as well as by the preaching of the Elders.  THE ALBERTA COLONY.  Recent letters from President Charles O. Card, in charge of our colony in Canada, contain information of a grati- fying nature. The soil upon which  they are located is said to be very pro- ductive, and the grain and vegetables produced are of excellent quality, and range for stock is abundant and nutri- tious. The colony is preparing for winter, and the families composing it will soon have their houses completed. They have opened a fine vein of coal within three miles of their settlement, which is on Lees Creek, Alberta, Canada.  The treatment accorded the Saints there, by officials and people, has been considerate and kind, and the pros- pects for improvements and propserity are good. Brother Card would be glad to have any of the Saints, contemplat- ing a change of location, to join him, in that land, and we will gladly ap- prove efforts in that direction.  CONCLUSION.  We cannot refrain from expressing to you our own feelings of thankful- ness that we live in such an age, and that God has bestowed upon us His Holy Priesthood and has permitted us to take part in His great work. We are thankful that we are associated with this people called Latter-day Saints; that we live in a day when Prophets and Apostles have been raised up in the Church of Christ; and that God has stretched forth His hand to fulfil[l] His great and marvelous pur- poses which have been predicted by the mouths of the holy prophets since the world began. We testify in the name of our Lord and Master, Jesus, that this is the great work of which the prophets have spoken, that God is the founder of it, and that it will stand forever, and accomplish all that has been predicted concerning it. Zion is established and will be redeemed. And it is our continual desire unto God that His people may be faithful in keeping His commandments and doing His will, so that they may be accounted worthy to stand, and their children after them, and inherit the great bless- ings which He has to bestow upon the faithful. The day is not far dis- tant when our Lord and Savior will be revealed from the heavens, and we should live in a constant expectation of this great event, and seek, with all the energy and power that we can exercise and obtain, to prepare ourselves, our households, and, as far as we have in- fluence, the inhabitants of the earth, for His glorious appealing.

Banks, of Pleasant Grove, late missionary to the Southern States. Elder Banks, pursu- ant to appointment, left Salt Lake City on the eleventh day of October, 1886. On reaching his destination he was appointed to labor in this eastern part of Tennessee, where he remained, meeting with fair success and enjoying his labors, until he was released to return home. He arrived in this city on the 20th of September last, in the enjoyment of excellent health and feeling thankful for the privilege of again shaking hands with his relatives and friends in Utah.  [line]  Sunday School Conference.  The Deseret Sunday School Union held a general meeting [at t]he Taber- nacle last evening, there being a very large attendance. The speakers were Assistant General Superintendent George Goddard, Superintendent John C.

A verdict of not guilty was r[e]ndered.  The case of the U.S. vs. John Harris, for unlawful cohabitation, resulted in a conviction.  Judge Emerson, Judge Bennett, Ar- ther Brown, ex-Prosecuting Attorney Dickson, J. N. Kimball, of Ogden, Judge Hoge and Judge Powers are in attendance at court, most of them as witnesses in the case against Maurice McGrath, indicted for stealing some notes of the court reporter in the fa- mous Bullion-Beck case.  Loren J. Neilsen, Miles McNoy, Joseph Barton, Henry Coats and Rich- ard Brown were admitted to citizen- ship.  The grand jury returned two United States and two Territorial indict- ments.

 Prest Woodruff addressed the Conference upon the importance of the Latter Day Dispensation the greatest that ever has ^been^ or ever will be committed to man on earth. 
 1 Prest Woodruff said that the Prophet Isaiah had faithfully described the travels of this people from Jackson County and Nauvoo across the Plains to these valleys and our settlements.  Zion must spread abroad the Saints will again take possession of their own and upon  every site that has been dedicated for that purpose a temple will be built by the Latter day [Saint??] 
 Prest W Woodruff said if the Saints paid their tithing punctually there would be no need to call for means to build temples as there would be an abundance for that purpose. The word of Wisdom is not obeyed as generally as it ought to be. Co Operation is a principle taught the saints as it is for their blessing. These small towns should not have more than one  Co-Op Store. Don't pull apart and put up other stores. He alluded to the scarcity of water and how easily difficulties would arise among  the brethren. Warned the saints against going to [law] 
 Prest Wilford Woodruff addressed the Conference on the necesity of living near to God and enjoying the Spirit of Revelations. Warned against taking advantage of one another. There are several temples in course of erection among the Latter Day Saints and he prophesied that they should be completed. 
 Prest Wilford Woodruff said we should be energetic in getting as many names as possible of our progenitors. 
 Prest W Woodruff said that the saints at Kirtland built their Temple in their poverty. Geo. A. Smith hauled the first load of rock that has been used in this generation for Temple f building  Related his early experience as a missionary Said he spoke so much about temple building because  he saw the necessity of this work. He had already  had the ordinance of Baptism performed for two thousand of his family. 
 Prest W Woodruff read the prayer of the Prophet Joseph while in Liberty jail. Said most of those who took part in the persecutions in Missouri have been destroyed one way or another Elias was promised to come before the great day of the Lord this refers more to the priesthood he held than to himself. This priesthood is now restored. Spoke upon the principle of baptism. 
 Prest. W. Woodruff spoke on the raising of our children said a great responsibility rested upon the mothers, as the children were always with them and would generally follow the mother's example, if the mother's were praying women the children would be praying children. 
 Prest. W. Woodruff spoke upon the blessings which could be obtained in Temples both for the living and the dead. He also spoke about the misery which follows those who swerve from the path of duty and degrade themselves with sin. 
 There were present on the stand Prest W. Woodruff who addressed the conference on the kind providence  of God in giving the Saints such abundant crops. 
 Prest. W. Woodruff said, if we could have the privi- lege of looking behind the veil, we would not need any sermons on Temple building; we would be so eager to rear them understanding the great necessity of this work, just think there are 50 generations waiting for us to do the work for them. 
 W Woodruff was pleased to meet with the saints and to hear how much they had done in regard to temple building. This was a peculiar trait belonging to the saints and not ex hibited by any other people. Reviewed the Lords doings in the different dispensations, showing that but a few was ever willing to obey God. 
 Prest. W. Woodruff compared this church to David who fought Goliath and like him we would come off victorious - 
 Prest W. Woodruff was pleased to see the saints enjoy so many blessings. There is but one way of building up the Kingdom of God and that is by paying strict attention to the performance of our duties. 
 Prest. W. Woodruff said that the Lord had commenced this work and he will see that it be victorious. 
 Prest. W W. Woodruff addressed the conference on our duty to be faithful in our covenants and to be diligent in Temple building. The Saints should not bear any feelings against one another. God will overrule all for our good. 
 Prest W Woodruff said he had been in the Church 50 years   related several incidents of the conduct of the prophet Joseph   Bore his testimony that he was a true prophet. 
 Apostle Wilford Woodruff said he was pleased to meet the Saints in conference. The Lord has set his hand to gather Israel in fullfilment of  prophecy, had been with the Church for fifty years, a little one has become an hundred and fifty thousand: The Lord has decreed he will raise up a righteous nation out of this people, yet we have a work to do, as the war between God and Satan will continue untill Christ comes. 
 Pres. Woodruff was much pleased to meet with the young people He said they have a work before them that no other generation has ever had. Spoke of the responsibility that would in the near future rest upon the yong people, that they would have to bear of this Kingdom.  Singing and Benediction

There Brethren imparted much good council and administration to us especially on the word of wisdom and as to guarding the youth of our wards. The Saints realized and sensed the importance of all that was said to us in there matters and we look for an increasing conformity to the laws of the Lord among us. We have had a good deal of sickness and some deaths. The weather was seasonable and all enjoyed the conference very much. Temporally we are being prospered notwithstanding the low price of products.

We find however that Bro Johnson  has been called and accepted a mission  to the Southern States to leave home  August next.

 Reservoir March 11, 1890  Pres. W. Woodruff Dear Brother:  I have thought for quite a little while time I would ask you what to do with the papers of the transfer of Lees Ferry. I have them left with me by Bro. Snow I think and I have met another matter I thought I must mention to you as I am getting old, or my health is not good. Bro. B. Young sent me word to meet him at Snowflake as there were some unsettled Sunset Matters.  Now what on earth I have to do with them if there things unsettled connected with that company I could not tell for the life of me, as years since I, as perhaps you will recollect, I turned over to receivers every dollar I had belonging to that Co. and positively declaired having anything to do in the settlement of the business of the Company.  But Bro. Snow instisted that I shold meet with the committee. I did so and they almost entirely ignored me in the business which was more pleasant to me than to have been a connected with it.  I did know more about the business of the company than any person living but NOW I positively know nothing and what I am trying to get at I want you to protect me so that I am moyed & perplexed tith that disagreeable matter, disagreeable to me because I am sure I was most shamfully cheated in connection with it.  Is this asking something something unjust or unfair? If so never take any notice of tithis letter. I have had so much to annoy & Know no more than I do. I am tired.  There is another matter I want to speak to you about but will not now. O how keea ^Queer^ I have felt about the situation you folks are in up there now. dGod help you is the only thing I can think of. All are pretty well. The Lord bless you for ever. Lot Smith

 W. Woodruff June 30 [18]80  Salt Lake City, June 19, 1880. President Lot Smith, Sunset.  Dear Brother I received your letter of June 7, and was glad to hear from you, but sorry to learn that you had let that colt kick you in the face. That is a trick that I thought you never allowed your horses to do, but I suppose he being a colt had not learn- ed the lesson. I hope it will not be a lasting injury to you. I am glad to learn that you had a good conference. I should certainly have been glad to have been with you. You speak of the spring crops, etc. It seems to me that winter has just broken here. We are now having hot weather. It has been so cold that corn could not grow. It stands just on top of the ground, but it is now begin- 
 ning to grow.  All crops are back- ward, but we have plenty of water. I am glad to hear your stock is doing well, and to learn of a good start on the tannery, and that it is doing well. I wanted to know how that bark mill did. I think you had a good offer for the fifty heifers, $20 each, but perhaps they will do you as much  good as the money. Has your mare Mary got a horse colt? Give my love to my Indian friends when they ask about me. J. W. Y. said he had baptized Tenney Comiaga's son (I want to say right here that I spoke at Provo on my Indian visit, and the reporter published it in the Territorial En- quirer without my seeing it, and it was a very incorrect report, represen- ting me as saying many things which I did not say. It was a bad, jumbled mess. I name it 
 here in case you should read it, for I do not claim it as my report at all.)  I am in hopes someday of seeing Sunset and other settlements in Arizona again. Will you please inform me in your next letter what those tithing orders are that Jesse N. Smith has given on you, for we do not know any thing about them here in the Salt Lake office. I want to advise you and all the settlements in Arizona to make an annual report of all tithing to the general tithing office here, as other stakes do, for it will remove all chance of prejudice against those who are living in the United Order. But we do not know where those tithing orders are from, nor who has given them, that you speak of. 
 I named what you wrote concerning answering any calls that President Taylor might make on you, but he prefers altogether for you to make up your regular tithing account annually, and let that be sub- ject to his order and no more. I was glad to learn that Foutz and Walker and J. W. Y. were getting settled all right. Remember me kindly to Brother Neilson, and say to him that I got his ferry stock account all right, which will enable me to give credit to whom due. It is a general time of health with us, with few exceptions. Elder O. Pratt's health is still quite delicate. We expect: Geo. Q.  Cannon with us on Tuesday. I am always glad to hear from you. Remember me kindly to all in the fort. Please deli- ver the inclosed to whom directed, and oblige your brother in the Gospel.  W. Woodruff 
 Salt Lake City, Nov. 10", 1882. Dear Brother Lot.  Your letter dated  Dec 1" (you meant Nov. 1") arrived all  safe and I was very glad to get it. I had not time to say all I thou- ght about the matter when I wrote; I did not say that I believed the  reports that were written to Prest.

Lot Smith,  Dear Brother,  I received your first letter after you  returned home. I was truly glad to hear from you, and that Jim. had got well. I have been so overwhelmed since I got home, with  Conference meetings, councils, company day & night that I have hardly  had time to look a wife in the face. I have had no time to write  and have not now, only a few moments. I was appointed at the  Conference the Supt of the Young Men's M. I. Assns for the Terry. & Moses  Thatcher and Jos. F. Smith; Counselors. I went to Ogden on Saturday  to attend the Stake Conference of the Young Men. I forwarded the Tithing Receipts for the money I brought from Arizona. I sent back the Order of L. Hatch  as they could not change it. I sent them back to you. I hope you got them. Half of Farmington and part of  Salt Lake County enquired about you. Your wife from  Farmington called upon me and wanted to know how  you get along. I told them well. The apostles seemed  to appreciate washat assistance you are rendering  to the needy who want bread. I wish also to say  in this connection that the mother of Joseph H. Wil- kins of St John, she lives in Ogden. He is one of the car- penters we took dinner with at St John. His mother has heard that he had nothing to eat but black beans. She wanted to know  if she could not deposit 25 or 30 bus. of wheat in the Tithg Office 
 but by the father stating as I said that  he brought in a new wagon, worth  (I think) $140 and got one of no use  except for old iron etc. and that you held  an iron rod over his head and made  him sign a receipt, fully by force, before  you would let him go.  I did not think a man would put such a tale as  that in writing without something to make  it out of.  I do not wish you to send  any statement of all your operations to  Prest. Taylor since you have been in the  order, not on my account for I do not  think he would have time to read them  for I think he has now more than he  wants to attend to; but it is well for you to  keep all evidence in your hands to  meet any accusations that may ever be  brought against you. 
 I am much pleased with your nar- rative of the Echo Canyon war, in the  Contributor.  It is very interesting  This is about all I want to say  at this time.  Give my love to your  wives and children and all the men. women, & children in Sunset.  You brother in the Gospel, W. Woodruff   
 and let him [page torn] in Arizona. I talked with Bp. Hunter about it, and he said he would do it. But I did not know  where he could get the wheat in Arizona, except it was of you. So I told her to deopposit some wheat in the office and I would  send the order to you and I hope you will do what you can  about it. I think you took a bucket of flour to him, when we  went there. We had a good conference, a large assembly, and the  Spirit of the Lord with us. I want you to give my love and blessings  to all the inhabitants of Sunset not leaving out the sisters and chil- dren. I have not time now to write upon any thing much only  on business and hardly that. I found my family all well & glad to  see me, as I was them. Please say to Bro Pitkin, I recd his letter &  will write him when I can get time. Give my love to Bro Lake Brigham City, St Joseph and all my friends who enquire. I judged  from what I learned from your letter that you was not going  to have much trouble on the timber question, which I am thank- ful for, I shall always be glad to hear from you.

 Private. I wish to say that the subject came up of our permitting the  young people to be married by the Authorities of the Church in Arizona, without  going to the Temple. And the Council all sustained it where they were so  far from the Temple. And the remark was made, that it would seem neces- sary to establish a place for Endowments at some future time in  Arizona so that young people could get legally married, without  going so far. I got a telegram from J. W. Y. at Albu- querque was buying goods. I hope Bro Tenney will not  mix any Mdse with the St John Purchase. And the Council  wish all Co-op stores to be governed by the Presidency of the Stake. W

 W. Woodruff, Dec. 14, 1880 St. John Mission, 200 families should go there to settle. Bishop Udall authorized to  recieve any tithing in Arizona: for payment of St. John.  Salt Lake City, Dec. 14, 1880. Mr. Lot Smith, Sunset, Arizona.  Dear Brother Your letter of Nov.  24th arrived all safe, but I have  not had time to answer it before. I was pleased to hear that you had a pros- perous journey to the west and back. I would have liked to have been with you  at St. George, but could not be. I have  thought perhaps that I might visit St. George  some time during the winter, to attend  to some Church business.  It is a  general time of health with us, with  few exceptions.  C. C. Rich is gaining  some.  O. Pratt's health is quite poor- ly .  My health is quite good. I got on the scales the other day. I  weighed 166 lbs., about 4 lbs. more  than I ever weighed before.  My  first wife a week ago had twenty five 
 teeth drawn at one time, under the in- fluence of ether, which made her sick for 24  hours, and she has had a sore mouth ever  since.  We had the coldest November  I ever saw.  It is more mild this  month.  Geo. Q. Cannon is in  Washington.  I have not heard from  him since he left.  I was sorry to  hear of the bad luck of Brigham City Saints with their crops.  Are they all  leaving?  Where does Brother Lake go? How much wheat did you have, and how  much corn?  Bishop Udall of St. John has been with us to get help to pay  for that place. He supposed, from  Brother Tenney's representation, that the  purchase was made for the Church, that is, that the Trustee was made  responsible for the payment. This  was a wrong idea entirely. It  was bought for the Latterday Saints  to go there, take possession of the land, 
 Salt Lake City, April, 15, 84. Lot Smith. Dear Brother:-  Enclosed you  will find a sheet containing the  apportionment of the various Stakes  in Utah to strengthen St. Johns. We held a meeting in the Social  Hall last night and called 30  families from this stake; if 20 of  them go I will be satisfied.  I  sent out a copy last night to all  the presidents of Stakes in the Ter- ritory hoping that they will act  promptly.  I received two letters from A. M. Tenney who says it is quiet  at present but the enemies are hold- ing secret meetings and planning  mischief.  I am sending a copy of the  apportionment to Bp. Udall to Jesse  N. Smith to be forwarded by 
 and pay for it, but it has got in such  a fix that the trustee had has had to  stretch out his hand to assist to save  the place.  He gave an order on the Southern herds for some 275 cows. Brother Udall conveyed an idea that  you told him that you had 100 cows  held in reserve to help to pay for  that place.  Brother Udall said  he had not received them, and the  question arises, Where are they? I did  not know whether there was any mis- understanding about it. We want  him to have any Church tithing of any  kind in Arizona, that he can make use  of, until that place is secured and  paid for.  Again, Brother Taylor  has put it upon me to have all the  emigration of the Saints that go to  Arizona, to go to St. John, until there is  enough there to take the land and water  and use it.  Brother Udall said 
 private conveyance, so that he  may know what we are doing.  Prest. Taylor, Cannon, and  several others start for the Iron  works on Wednesday and the  Presidency go on to St. George for  a short visit.  My kind love to all,  Your Brother in the gospel,  W. Woodruff  
 that he met nearly 100 wagons going  to Arizona, but he knew nothing about  them, nor where they were going to, and  thought many of them were going on  their own hook, perhaps to get off by  themselves.  But as most of the emi- gration will go by Sunset, I want to dele- gate you to say to them that the counsel of  the Presidency and Twelve Apostles to them  is to go direct to St. John and settle there  under the direction of Bishop Udall  until he says it is enough.  There  should be nearly 200 families settle there.  There should be men enough to  make use of all the water during  emigration time, or we shall constantly  have outsiders squatting down and  claiming waste water.  We wish  you to say to all emigration of the Saints who wish to claim fellowship with us, that we want them to take our counsel  in this matter and go to St. John, 
 instead of going everywhere else, until that place is settled, and if they will  not do this they cannot have our fel- lowship.  When St. John is settled, after it is done satisfactorily, they can  make changes if they wish.  We look  upon the St. John country as being as  good as any part of Arizona, and unless  the Saints possess and control St. John,  there is no Mormon settlement will have  any peace in that territory.  It seems  rather strange to us, the manner in  which the last election was controlled. Brother Tenney's representation to me was  that the Barth's asked for none of the offices  whatever, only for our people to vote for  the county seat to remain at St. John.  But, instead of this, in the election the  Mormons lost every office in the county. When I think that they hold the legal 
 majority of votes in the county, I think  our people will find hard work to live  under the control of that class of men  who have held control of Apache County. It seems as though there was a screw  loose somewhere in that election. But I feel that we should never rest  until we have full control of St. John  and root out that nest that dwells there.  If there is any tithing stock, grain or money in any part of  Arizona that Brother Udall can  use for the payment of this debt,  we wish him to have it.  My  love to your family and all the  Saints in Sunset, not forgetting  the children.  Your brother in the Gospel,  W. Woodruff

 Salt Lake City, Apr. 17th, 1883.  Lot Smith.  Dear Brother:  I received your very welcome letter of March 9th, which I read with much interest; it is the only information I have received concerning Bros. Young and Grant's travels in Arizona. I have had three short notes from them, but they gave me no account of their travels. Br. Grant spoke of attending the funeral of your little son.  I feel interested in the labor of the brethren among the Lamanites of all that country. The Oribas and Moquies are very dull and super- stitious and hard of understanding compared with the Navajoes, Zoonies, Lagooneies, and Islatos. I am sor- ry to hear of so much depredations from the Apaches; there are some renegades among them which will

 probably make war untill they are destroyed, but I hope the body of them will be at peace.  Bro's. Teasdale and Daulton have started for the Indian Territory. Br. Lyman has not started for the Uintah Reservation yet.  We are all as well as usual including the Twelve and Presidency. Mrs. Phebe Woodruff's health is rather poor but she does all of her house- work which is too much for her.  Br. Morgan has returned from the south and he spoke in meeting last Sunday giving a very good account of the Southern Mission. The public mind is much more favor- able toward us now than formerly. There are over 100 missionaries in that part of the vineyard, and but little opposition.  I am thinking of taking the D & Rio Grand road to Manassa some time in June or early summer to visit the saints there and attend con- ference; the road goes within three miles of the settlement.

 SALT LAKE CITY, APRIL 18, 1884.  Dear Brother,  We presume that the statement of the number of families apportioned to be selected from your Stake to strengthen the settlement at St. John, Ari- zona, has been received by you and acted upon.  We desire these brethren to proceed upon their journey as soon as they can possibly make it convenient to do so.  Some of those who are called may prefer to go by railroad, which is much more expeditious and expensive. We cannot say positively what the  fare will be by rail, but perhaps not less than forty dollars for adults, chil- dren under ten years, half price. But all this business can be satisfactorily  arranged in this city.  We deem it more prudent, in the majority of cases, for the brethren to go across country with teams. True, by team it is a long and tedious journey, but healthful and comparatively inexpensive. Then, when the brethren arrive at their destination, they have their teams, wagons, harness and many useful implements to begin to build up homes with and make their families comfortable.  The proper route for teams will be up the Sevier river, over the divide via Johnson to the Pahreah (formerly Lee's) Ferry, on the Big Colorado river, thence to Willow Springs, thence to Little Colorado river, up said river via Brigham City, Sunset, St. Joseph, Holbrook, Woodruff, Greer's Ranch, to St. John.  Those who desire to go by railroad will travel by the Denver & Rio Grande Railroad to Pueblo, thence by the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railroad to Albuquerque, thence by the Atlantic & Pacific Railroad to Navajo Station, which lies about forty miles north of St. John. Complete arrangements can be made for transportation by railroad, from this city to Navajo Station, thence by teams to St. John, by communicating with W. C. Spence, at President John Taylor's office, in this city.  W. Woodruff  Chairman. 
 W. Woodruff  had any little difficulty, they would come to me with their troubles. I should like to meet with all of them once more.  We have had a good conference; we set apart 107 missionaries the Monday following many of whom were for the Southern States. Bro's. Ivens and Pratt are beginning to baptize a good many in Mexico. One of Erastus Snow's sons and Helaman  Pratt are called to go there and assist in the work.  We are looking for the Commission- ers to arrive at any time now, but there is no excitement over them.  We are having our March weather in April -- it snows, rains & every few days.  I understand that you have been East some where for blooded bulls and stallions. What have you got? How many sheet [sheep], horned stock &c 
 have you now? I What famalies have you with you? Do you still keep up a dairy at Pleasant Vally? Your will, of course is gone. How do you get your lumber?  I am asking too many ques- tions but by visiting that country I feel interested in such questions.  As ever  Your Brother in the Gospel,  W. Woodruff

 Woodruff April 21 [18]80  Salt Lake City, April 21, 1880.  President Lot Smith.  Dear Brother I have a good many things I want to say to you with my pen, but up to the present hour I have found but very little time. We have been in either coun- cils, conferences, or meetings, of some kind, ever since I came home. I wrote to you on the 12th and sent the ti- thing receipts and a letter to J. W. Y. Since then I have received a letter from J. W. Y., saying they were buying goods at Albuquerque for Young, Christofferson, and others. He also spoke about taking a contract on the railroad for our people. President Taylor and myself telegraphed back that the Co-op. stores should be under the direction of the presidency of the stakes and those who furnish the money. 
 Salt Lake City, Mar. 23rd, 83.  Bro. & Sister Lot Smith:  I have just  received your letter containing the  painful news of the loss of your  little son Wilford. I feel to deeply  sympathize with you in your  loss and by such a death. My  oldest son, Wilford is 43 years to- day. When a child he drank lye which came very nearly killing  him. His throat grew up so that  he came verynear choking to death  for years afterwards and has  not got entirely over it yet. I  have sometimes thought the name  itself was rather unfortunate; still  I do not think that a name 
 I also got a letter, directed to Brother Taylor and W. Woodruff, saying that Brother Tenney had sent an agent to borrow a hundred cows, to Brother Flake, to make a payment this spring on the St. John purchase. Brother Hatch wanted the council to furnish Brother Murdock or bearer $1,000 for Brother Flake, and for Brother Flake to furnish that amount of barley to Brother Hatch for the people to sow and make bread of. But the coun- cil did not wish to do it. The coun- cil has decided that the presidents of stakes and bishops furnish Brother A. M. Tenney, as a loan, what tithing stock they may have on hand to help pay the 100 cows this spring, and we want to continue to pay for that purchase until it is settled for, but we want the people who go there to pay the debt, and not the church. 
 has anything to do with good  or bad fortune. Truly the loss of  children in that way is painful but there is one consolation in the  matter you will have him again  in the morning of the first resur- rection in your family organization,  of the same age and size that  you laid him away. I hope you may be comforted in your  affliction. I would like to see  you and your wives and children  once more. Give my kind love  to them all.  I expect that little Lorenzo who  used to help me about my break- fast is getting to be quite a  boy. I should like to see all  the children of the Sunset fort once more.  I understand that you went  with Brothers Young and Grant 
 But we think it is necessary to help about it, so that we shall not lose the purchase. I thought there had people enough gone there to raise the 100 cows this spring. But we think the church and the branches in Arizona will be under the ne- cessity of helping about it, as a loan, until the place is secure. I have not had word from Brother Tenney since I left about St. John on the mission.  I found my family all well on my arrival, and we were again glad to meet. We are having good times in our Conference meetings and councils. We are united in our councils and the spirit of the Lord is with us. There was a good deal of inquiry about you at the conference by Farmington people and others. I hope to hear from you and know how all is 
 to the Seven Villages. I wish  when you get time you would  give me a little sketch of your  visit among them how much time you spent with them, holding  meetings, with what success &c &c. How did as fat a man as  Brigham get up and down among them? I should be glad to hear  any information concerning their  visit with you. What are the pros- pects among the Lamanites and  what is A. M. Tenny ^doing^? What is  the prosperity in your settlement? Any thing of that kind would be  of interest to me. Give my kind  love to the people of the fort.  Write when you can.  Your Brother in the Gospel, W Woodruff 
 getting on in Sunset. I miss my society there very much, especially those dear children. I want to send my love and blessing to all sunset, men, women, and children. I inclose a letter to J. W. Y., which you will please forward to him, for I do not know where to find him. I also forward in this the order for 30 bushels of wheat for Brother J. W. Watkins at St. John. The brethren thought that as he was a missionary they would let him have as much wheat there as his mother put in here. I did not know but you would be close run on the wheat question, but whatever you can do in that line will be a blessing to him. It is still very cold here. On the 17th we had nearly a foot of snow. The mountains 
 are full of snow, and if we were to have warm weather we would stand a chance to have a heavy flood.  I want to send in your letter a few lines to Bishop Lake, of Brig- ham City, which please send to  him.  Your brother in the Gospel,  W Woodruff  Brother Lot Smith I would recommend that when you mark your lambs that you mark your tithing lambs for the Church, and also when you brand your calves put the church brand on your tithing calves, and that at the end of the year you make a report of what tithing you have on hand, and 
 W. Woodruff Salt Lake City, Oct. 23, 1882. Elder Lot Smith. Dear Brother - I have felt a desire to write to you for some time past. President Taylor is receiving letters from persons who leave your fort and go to other places to settle. They complain bitterly of your treatment of them in the settlement of their accounts. Among others, the Pitkins said that their property was priced very low when taken in, and very high when taken out. They said they gave in a wagon worth $125, which was priced at $50, and got a wagon in return good for nothing but old iron, and he was forced to sign a bill of receipt with an iron rod over his head, or something of that kind. Now of course these  stories are all on one side of the question But they have their effect against you, and I would like not to have any more such stories come to the First Pres- idency, if possible to avoid it. 
 that this instruction be given to all the branches in your stake.  Brother Taylor says they get no report of the tithing in Arizona, but I told him what had been paid on the ferry and the tithing money I brought. Please impart this instruction to Brothers Lake, Richards, etc. 
 2 Now I think that a man who has done as much for Israel as you have in your day, can afford to be generous with those who leave your settlement, and let  them have as good as they bring to you, inasmuch as they get no in- crease. There is hardly any man speaks well of you, who leaves your settlement. They generally go away dissatisfied. Brother Ira Hatch was called by the authorities to go to Savoy, to assist Brother Titien. I have Never heard of his saying anything upon the subject. The quorum of the Twelve have been districting Utah and the other territories on the Indian Mission question, but it has been referred to the Presidency, and is now in their hands. We appointed you to stand at the head of the mission in Sunset Stake, and Jesse N. Smith in Snowlake Stake, 
 3 and if this thing is confirmed by the Presidency, there may be some of the Twelve to visit all Arizona, New Mexico, etc., to assist in this organ- ization, as we shall want to gather all the missionary strength we can in all those stakes. There is a  great desire to make the Lamanite mission as effectual as possible throughout all the territories. President Taylor has received a revelation, in which George Teasdale and Heber J. Grant were appointed to fill the vacancies in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, and Seymour B. Young and Abram H. Cannon were appointed to fill the vacancies in the quorum of the First Presidency of the Seventies, all four of whom have been ordained. We had a good Conference, strong preaching and strong testimony. John T. Caine is 
 4 the People's candidate for Congress, and Van Zile the ring candidate. Now, Brother Lot, I want you to write  me a letter and tell me how many families you have got left with you. How your crops are this season. How is the Indian question? What is the prospect of labor among the Navajoes, Moquis, etc.? How is your health, and how is your fami- ly? Give my love to them all. C.C. Rich was with us at Conference a part of one meeting. We anointed him and blessed him. He is some better, but no prospect of getting well. We have had a long wet cold spell, but now it is quite pleasant weather. Write as soon as convenient and give me all the news with you. Your brother in the Gospel W. Woodruff. Per J. J. 
 W. Woodruff  Salt Lake City,  Feb. 26th, 1884.  Lot Smith.  Dear Brother.  I received  your letter of Feb. 18th and  I was glad to hear from  you as I always am.  I was sorry to have that interesting letter get drown- d and the money too,  but it was better for that to be lost than for the man, at least if he  was worth more than a  hundred dollars and he ought to be.  I would be glad to visit you again and to visit your settlements, but I do not know when  it will be. I would like to visit your new settle- 
 ments at least the one in the mountains. I would like to know what you are doing with Sunset are you occupying the place now; is it your post office? I see that you date your letter there. The Moquis are an innocent people but I think quite superstitious in some things.  There seems to be quite an opening among the  Maricopas and Pimas the  leading men are receiv- ing the work and I think the tribes will follow. They had quite a difficulty of late with Crismon and his boys. I think his  boys are hard cases. they  take up Indian stock  put them in the pen and charge $1 a head and  the Indians put some of Crismon's cattle in the pen and charge 50  each 
 and the Crismon boys  undertook to take them by force and threatened their lives and there would have been a fight and the Cris- mon family wiped out if  it had not been for Hinck- ley, Ray and Hawks, our  missionaries who stopped the Crismon boys coming out on the ground to  fight; that family has made a good deal of trouble with Lamanites and Mormons. Br. Young is  visiting in California; I expect him home soon.  Br. Thatcher has retur- ned from Washington and Br. Cannon is on his way home which leaves Br. Caine alone. I do not know what Cong- ress will do but they are getting wicked enough  to do anything.  It is a general time 
 Salt Lake City, Jan. 27, 1881.  Lot Smith,  Dear Brother; I recieved  your letter of Dec. 28, 1880. I have  not been able to answer it before. I am very sorry for your accident  and hope you will recover from it,  and that you may not be permen^an^tly  lame. I do not hear a word from  E. Snow or B. Young; in fact, do  not know where they are or what they  are doing, but suppose they are some- where in Arizona.  We learned that Bishop Udell  has crossed the Lees Ferry with all  his stock, all well. I hope he will  have good luck in getting them to  St. John in safety.  I see the editors of the "Dem- ocrat" seems to have a key to get  knowledge. I know nothing of the 
 of health with us. I am  somewhat troubled with a cold at present which is  a common complaint in this country at present.  Br. Fowler who was labor- ing in the Tithing Office, died rather suddenly; we bury him tomorrow. We  are having pleasant weather overhead but our streets are very muddy.  Our Legislators are grin- ding away the best they can, but I do not know  what they will accomplish.  I spent the most of De- cember in St. George Tem- ple and had a good  time and a good con- ference. I wish you would tell me by letter how many you have with you and 
 elections only from Brother Tenny.  I am glad you are so fruitful. I hope your posterity will honor both  God and their parents.  I think the Navajoes were suc- cessful on their hunt.  I hope Mary's boys will prosper  as well as the rest.  Remember me kindly to all your  family and all in the Fort.  We got a letter from George Q. Cannon. He feels well and is boyant in spirit. Says God reigns, and is thoroughly con- vinced that Gov. Murry has hurt him- self and his party much more than  George Q and the Saints.  The Apostles are all well ex- cept O. Pratt and C. C. Rich. The lat- ter is gaining very slowly, and O. Pratt is quite poorly: mostly confined to  his bed and room is quite weak. But  we hope for the best. 
 what your prospect is for  farming in your new settle- ment. Are you going to abandon Sunset; if so will you move your buildings  to your new settlement? What will be done with the place what is done with the mill; are there any inhabitants in Brigham City? What is Br. Lake doing and where is  he?  Remember me kindly to  your Wwives children and  friends, and write when you can.  Your time [true] friend and brother  in the Gospel,  W Woodruff 
 I am spending a good deal of time  attending quarterly conferences.  We had a very cold November, but  quite open December and January.  Will you please read the enclosed  to the emegration who passes through  Sunset to Arizona and oblige?  We have eight members of the  Idaho Legislature Joseph Rich the  most conspicuous.  Have the Saints entirely abandoned  Brigham City? What are they going to do with the place? Has Brother  Tenny left Sunset? Where has he gone? How is the timber question  with you? Is it settled all right  with the officials?  As ever, Your Brother in the gospel,  W. Woodruff 
 Salt Lake City, Nov.28, 1882.  President Lot Smith.  Dear Brother - I received your letter of Nov. 15, and in reading it I would judge that you had not received the letter I wrote you Nov. 10. You did not say that you had received it. I stated plainly in that letter in a private note that I did not believe the reports given about you. It is true, you cannot hin- der people talking, any more than I can and I do not care what people say against one, if they do not tell the truth. I could tell my enemies a great many failings I have that they do not know anything about, but I do not feel disposed to tell them. They may lie about me as much as they please, and I suppose they will do the same by you. I probably did not explain myself clearly when I said that I did not want anymore of the stories to come to Brother Taylor. I have always held uup to all men what you had done for years in the support of the Saints

I will now say that the Twelve are being districted throughout the Indian country. E. Snow and Mo- ses Thatcher go to Mexico. B. Young and H. J. Grant go to Arizona. G. Teasdale to the Indian Territory. L. Snow and F. D. Richards to all Indians in the north, as far as wisdom dictates. F. M. Lyman through Uintah reservation. I felt like volunteering to go to Arizona. Brother Taylor thought I was almost too old, and ought to stay here.( He did not say to preach to the Indians and heathen in Salt Lake City ) but I shall have to attend conferences. I would have been glad to have visited you once more in Sunset and the Saints in Ari- zona. Geo. Q. Cannon started this morning for Washington with John T. Caine and others, to introduce them, etc. There have been many ques- tions come up before the Presidency and Twelve, but we cannot yet

I would like to know how the election stands with our people in Apache County. Who is elected? Myself and family are as well as usual. L. John Nuttall is able to be about his house, not to come to the office. Judge Elias  Smith is barely able to sit in a rocking chair, he is still very feeble. We have just been on a two weeks' tour through Sanpete, Juab, and Utah stakes, holding meetings. We have now very pleas- ant weather. My love to all with you. Your brother in the Gospel.  W.

 Salt Lake City, Dec 7th, 1882.  Lot Smith.  Dear Brother:  Your letter of  Nov. 28th, is before me, and I feel to say  a little more upon the subject before  us. I wrote to you on Nov. 28th which  of course you had not received when you wrote last.  I will here explain what I meant  in speaking of Prest. Taylors' not having  time to read such accounts as you  spoke of. Of course he could ^read^ a letter,  but if you sent a history of every man  that has been with you in that order, what he brought in, and what he  took out, it would be a document  as large as the New Testament, and 
 nan 
 unless you were on trial for these  things it would not be necessary.  I received a very interesting letter  yesterday from Br. Christian Lingo Chris- tensen upon the Indian question. The  administration to that lame Indian was  very interesting. The time has come  when we are commanded to turn  unto them and it is beginning to be  a day of God's power among them, and  it is our duty now to go among them. I have felt to volunteer to go among  them in Arizona and labor with them;  but Br. Taylor rather claimed the right  to distribute us. So he sends B. Young  and H. J. Grant to Arizona & New Mexico. They will start about Jan. 6th, [18]83 and  visit you and will look to you and  Jesse N. to assist in their labors among  them. E. Snow and M. Thatcher are now  in Mexico, I suppose. F. M. Lyman goes 
 nan 
 through the Uintah reservation, G. Teasdale  to the Indian Territory, Cherokees, &c. L. Snow  & F. D. Richards attend to the northern  tribes. I shall give my views to Br. Brigham about his labor with you and  the brethren in that territory.  Concerning Br. Charles W. Stayner, he  has been getting a code of revelations  as big as the New Testament, and  he, himself was to be the great coming  man. Arthur Stayner at first said  it was all from the devil; if he had  stuck to it, it would have been well,  but he finally fell in with and believed  them. Chas. W. has been brought before  a High Council and finally confessed  they were not of God, asked forgiveness and has been forgiven; now, if he gives  them up, all will be well with him.  Prest. Taylor requires me to tarry  in this country and not go into the 
 nan 
 W. Woodruff  Indian field. He thinks I am most  too old and then I have the Historian's  Office on my hands and a great deal of correspondence concerning the temples and other matters, and he wants me  to attend the conferences in this country. Br. Taylor and myself with those of the  Twelve who are here are now travelling  two-thirds of the time. We have just been through Sanpete, Juab, and Utah  counties. We start in the morning for  the north.  Manti Temple is ready to turn the arches over the upper story windows, and Logan Temple will be ready for dedi- cation by next Sept.  it might be by  April if they had means enough. We are in hopes that the Salt Lake Tem- 
 ple will be up to the square next  fall.  From what I learn I suppose a  part of the county offices in the late  election fell into the Mormons.  I and my family are as well as  usual; the Presidency and Twelve are  also well. L. John Nuttall is around  his house again. Elias Smith is still very bad, being confined to his bed, and  in great pain most of the time. In  his fall, he feel upon his lame side  and paralyzed his right leg; and it  looks as though it would be months  before he can walk again if he can  at all. Capt. Hooper came near dying  of late. Br. Van Cott is very low with  brights disease. Br. Peck is able to be 
 out again.  Prest. Arthur thinks there has been en- ough legislation at present for the Mor- mons. But Gov. Murry thinks differently,  and Murry may attempt to appoint  another Prest. Van Zile for instance.  Remember me to all with you, es- pecially your wives and children.  Your Brother in the Gospel, W. Woodruff. 
 Salt Lake City, Utah. Nov. 8th, 1883.  Lot Smith.  Dear Brother.  Your very kind  letter of Nov. 1st arrived all safe and I read a portion of it  in Council yesterday (I left  out that portion concerning my  interest in humanity as my  company might have differed  from you in that sentiment I  would not read it to them). All  were much pleased with your  account of the Indians. Br. Teas- dale has returned from the  Cherokee Nation; he has labored  hard for six months and not 
 baptized a soul. Brs. Daulton  and felt are still there but find  it an up-hill business. I would  rather go among the wild Indi- ans to convert them to the gospel than among those who are so  much Christianized and priest rid- den.  I was glad you agreed with  me about your family here.  I  understand they were calculating  to go back, I have not seen  them since.  I suppose that Brs. Young  and Grant are some where in  your country you will probobly  see them.  We buried Brs. Lewis Robison  and Israel Barlow; we have  buried a good many aged  people during the present year.  We attended Logan Conference 
 on Saturday and Sunday. We went all through the Temple and  expect to see it ready for dedi- cation by March. The roof of  the Manti Temple will soon be  finished. Salt Lake Temple is up  to the square there will be a  few more rocks laid before it  is put aside for the winter.  Brs. Cannon, Richard, and  Caine are at Washington looking  after the business of Zion.  Remember me kindly to  your family and my friends  with you.  Your Brother in the Gospel, W. Woodruff 
 Dec. 17 [189]6  Prest. W. Woodruff Box B Salt Lake City, Utah  Dear Brother,  Referring to yours of Oct. 13 indicating that $400. had been appropriated to the Bannock Stake Academy on condition that the church could make the payment. Can you now send us an order on the Bishops General Storehouse or shall we use your letter as authority for distributing the remnant? With kind regards  Your Brother in the Gospel Jas.
