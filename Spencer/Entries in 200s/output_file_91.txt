 Elder W. Woodruff.-- The Lord gives unto us revelation and truth as fast as we can make good use of them. It is a great blessing for us to know that we have the gospel, and not to be in doubt or in ignorance of our true position, which was the case before we embracedthis work. We have apostles and prophets, a foundation upon which to rest our faith. The position we occupy, to-day, is vastly superior to that of the world. We read in the Book of Mor-mon that no nation or people will be permitted to dwell upon this land when the cup of their iniquity is full; when that is the case they cannot escape being overthrown. He quoted an instance from the Book of Mormon, where the Nephite nation were destroyed because of their sins. The spirit of God is being witheld from the nations of the earth, because of their iniquity. This is a good people. The Lord is striving with them. The Spirit of the Lord rests upon them, and they desire continually to do right and to live in the command-ments of the Lord. As the wicked be-come more wicked, we should increase in righteousness. This is the kingdom of God and will prevail. The ancient prophets spoke of this kingdom and this day in which we live, when the earth should be sanctified, and the way prepared for the coming of the Son of Man in the clouds of heaven. God has given us wise men to lead us, and the Lord reveals His secrets unto His ser-vants the prophets. We are the sons of Israel and the daughters of Zion, and God is our friend; and we know that we are right. We should seek to be-come sanctified before the Lord, and not to do any thing unless we are sure it is right. It is important that we teach our children righteous principles, for we fathers are wearing out, and they will have to step forth and continue the work that we are engaged in. If parents instil righteous principles in the minds of their children, those chil-dren will be affected by them through-out all their lives. The children God has given to this people are a great blessing to them, and should be care-fully reared and educated, for the Lord is raising among us a kingdom of priests. Children have got faith in what their parents teach them, and parents should not conduct themselvescontrary to what they teach their chil-dren, that the precepts they teach may be sustained by example. Let us pray to our Father in heaven, for He holds the elements in His own hands, and can use them to hedge up the way of the wicked. Prayer is a mighty weapon, and we should be armed with it, as well as with other preparations, and thus be ready for what ever may occur. Let us be faithful before the Lord and prize and profit by these visits of our President.

 Elder Wilford Woodruff addressedthe Saints: We need constant teachings that we may understand our duties thoroughly. This is a great work, and God requires a good people to work with, and for this purpose the elders of Israel have traveled through all the world, to gather together the propermaterial to work with. We now are trying to sanctify ourselves before God, to be worthy of our high calling, to build up His kingdom. It is our busi-ness to try to establish the kingdom of God in spite of all the opposition that is arrayed against us. He gave some ex-cellent instructions regarding the train-ing of children.

 Elder Wilford Woodruff.--We are striving as the servants of God to im-prove ourselves, our families and the Saints. I know there is an improve-ment. We possess the Spirit of the Lord, and it is weaning our hearts from the things of this world. If Pres. Young and his friends are willing to leave their homes and their business, we think you should leave your labors to come together to worship and pray to God, and to honor Him and His servants. There is not another set ofmen on earth who are seeking to establish the kingdom of God and sanctify themselves and the earth upon which they stand. If any person de-serves respect and honor it is God and His servants. I have lived to see the kingdom of God established; I have seen his prophets and apostles, and they have taught us to receive exalta-tion and glory in the presence of God. If we had all the wealth of the earth at our command, it would hold no com-parison to the riches of eternal life which we possess. Of all men under the heavens we have the greatest reason to be thankful. We ought to be united with the President of the church and with our Bishops, and wives and children should be united with their husbands and parents; and all of us should be firmly united to God and His cause. The children of God are His glory, and He wishes to teach them the knowledge of eternal life. Our glory is our children; they are the commencement of our kingdoms. You should not correct your children in anger. Mothers should seek to have the Spirit of the Lord with them when they are raising children. The fathers of families are placed to preside over them in wisdom, and should do it under the dictations of the Holy Spirit. We should try to rear our children by example, and not exact from them what we do not do ourselves. We have got to build up the kingdom of God and protect it. Our Father in Heaven and the prophets and spirits of just men made perfect are watching us and wait-ing for us, for they who have gone be-fore without us cannot be made perfect. All that we are required to do is in the building up of the kingdom, and the more faithful we are the more we shall desire to do the work of God, and readily engage in everything that will beautify the land of Zion. This course will secure unto us the protection and bless-ing of heaven in every trying moment and in every difficulty. Let us seekthe Lord always, and ask Him for everything we need, for He will be in-quired of, and as He sees we are pre-pared, and willing to sustain His king-dom, He will bless us. 
 Neils A. MorkMay 18 [18]98 
 Elder Wilford Woodruffâ€”It is a great privilege to live in this day, and to be associated with the Saints in this dis-pensation, in building up the kingdom of our God. In this work it is necessary that the Saints be taught in principles earthly and heavenly. I look upon the Latter-day Saints as possessing not only the keys of the kingdom, but the spirit of it also, to prepare them for the accomplishment of this great work. It is interesting to travel among this people and mark their improvements and the progress they are making tem-porally and spiritually. The Lord has a people here that will try to be moulded in a way that He can handle them. In our travels among the Saints this season, we have been taught good principles by the First Presidency and the Twelve. We are gathered into these valleys to be instructed and taught to build up the kingdom, and we have a great deal yet to learn. Israel of old was inspired by the same spirit which inspires the Latter-day Saints; and that Spirit pro-duces a union among us such as has never been excelled among any people, according to the time they have existed in an organized form. The revolu-tionary fathers did not forsee the effect of their movements upon the future. So with the operations of Zion's Camp. In the future, the work which they ac-complished will be looked upon as a mighty one; so, also, with the Mormon Battalion. The history of the founda-tion and progress of this church will be more wonderful and interesting than the history of any other people since the world began. The heavens are full of knowledge and wisdom, and it has in part been revealed to us through God's servants.There is something God-like and glorious in the doctrines and revela-tions which have been given unto us through the prophets of God; and if we do what is enjoined upon us, we are doing the work which we have been appointed to perform. Inasmuch as this is our work we should try to bend our minds to it. We should be pre-pared for every emergency; we cannot know what awaits us unless we areguided and led day by day by the Lord. Let Him forsake us, and we could not move forward. We are living where we have peace, and we need not asso-ciate with the wicked. We should lay the counsels of God to heart, and ac-complish all we are told to do, perform-ing every duty. We should rejoice and be humble before the Lord, and seek with all our might to build up His kindom, for in so doing we build up ourselves. We have grown, increased and advanced from the commencement until now, and God will defend His poople and His servants so far as we arefaithful. There is a union among this people that the world dread. The policy of the world is to be divided, but the heavens are united and are led by Eloheim. So the kingdom of God on earth is a pattern of things in heaven. May Jacob flourish, become a strong nation and overcome evil and the works of the devil and triumph forever, Amen. 
 Elder Wilford Woodruff reasoned onthe inconsistency of trusting a matterof such importance as our salvation tothe direction of God and His servants,and yet being afraid to be dictated fromthe same source on our temporal affairs.Referring to gardening and agriculturehe said, -- "I have visited your orchards,and am glad to see them. They arebearing apples and peaches and apricots.In setting out on orchard set out goodfruit trees. In sowing flax, it should be sown thickly on rich land, and itwill yield fine lint. We must sow cleanseed of every kind we sow; and we must fallow our lands, or weed our crops,and mow down the sunflowers and other weeds out of the margins of ourfields and streets. We must learn to make our own clothing, or becomebankrupt. I have heard PresidentYoung preach to our sisters aboutmaking their bonnets for the last tenyears. Listen to his counsels and thecounsels and advice of others of theservants of God and the Lord willbless us." We have reason to have confidence in those who have lead usfor half a century, and lead us con-stantly in the right way. We shouldhave confidence in such men if weknew comparatively nothing; but whenwe may know the truth of their teach-ings for ourselves, by the revelations ofthe Spirit, our confidence is doublystrong. The Lord will prove his ser-vants and handmaidens, and if we arefaithful we need have no fears. 
 Elder Woodruff noticed that Mor-monism is a living, acknowledged factin the earth. The wicked have a greatdeal more fear that it is true than thatit is false. For years they have strivento overthrow it, still it lives, and isgrowing in power and importance. We have no right to expect that the Lordwill do for us what we can do for our-selves. He is blessings us with contin-ually increasing light and knowledge,revealing principles by which we maybecome more firmly and closely united,and requires of us that we carry out thegreat work commenced for the salva-tion of man temporally and spiritually.

 Elder Wilford Woodruff:â€”I havebeen aquainted with President Youngfor over thirty years as an Elder in Is-rael, and have never heard him givecounsel that was not followed withblessings to those that obeyed it. TheLord has made ns [us] free agents, and itwe wish to travel the path to heavenwe must obey the laws that will guideus there. In my visits with the Presi-dent among the Saints I discover an in-creasing spirit of obedience and unionamong the people. The Saints shouldbe united in elections, as in building atemple, or in doing anything else thatis required of them. Unless we carryout this principle in all our acts andlabors we do not feel right andwe cannot prosper. I want to see all the Latter-day Saints united upon the principles of life and salvation. TheLord has given us the Holy Priesthood to save our ourselves, our wives, our chil-dren and our dead. Whenever theSaints are disunited upon anything, their progress in holiness stops rightthere. We are free agents and can goto heaven or to hell as we please; butupon the matter of the kingdom of Godwe must be willing to united as oneman if we desire to receive salvation,for it is upon this principle that theheavens are governed. We are calledto build up this kingdom, and nogreater honor was ever conferred uponany beings in heaven or on the earth.

 Elder W. Woodruff reasoned upon the position of the Saints, and the con-dition of the world. They have been in darkness for ages, without a man in-spired by the revelations of Heaven to teach them, and ignorance, sin and in-iquity abound; we have the society of prophets and apostles who reveal to usthe principles and laws of life. It is the right of him who presides over the church to dictate us in all things per-taining to the building up and guidance of that great kingdom that Daniel said should be built up in the last days. He advised the people to plant trees, make their homes comfortable, and increase in everything good and praisworthy.

 Elder Wilford Woodruff.â€”There has never been a time from the beginning to this day when this kingdom has not been on the progress. We have seen gloomy times, but the Lord has never deserted His faithful servants; and the Spirit of God was with His poor, af-flicted Saints in all their doings and troubles. Now look at this people and their great prosperity. Look at this fruit here as an evidence ot it. Such fruit cannot be raised in the best fruitdistricts of the east. Who has given to us these great blessings and this great prosperity. It is our Godâ€”the God of heaven. Then how faithful we should be in keeping His laws. I am much pleased to see the improvements you are making here, and hope you will continue your labors until you make this place very desirable. The speaker then encouraged the Saints to sanctifythemselves before the Lord, and to con-tinue their improvements making their homes beautiful and desirable, that their children might have strong in-ducements to remain at home and not wander off where they might be led into doing wrong.

 Elder W. Woodruff touched upon the bondage of evil and the liberty guaran-teed in the gospel. He spoke of the force and power of habit, and exhorted the Saints to so accustom themselves to doing right that by being habituated in it they would not be able to feel con-tented while any duty remained unper-formed which might be required of them. He encouraged them to abidethe counsel of the President in attend-ing to their temporal duties as readily as they would if called to go on mis-sions. 
 Elder W. Woodruff spoke of the variety of subjects that had been treated upon during the meetings, and reason-ed that the Lord had chosen the best elements he could find of which to build his kingdom, and had sent forth the best spirits to lead its progress. He alluded to the work that had been done by the Prophet Joseph, by President Young and others, and expressed him-self that the Saints in "Dixie" had done well, the blessing of God having been with them, and exhorted them to be the friends of God. 
 Apostle Woodruff said the breth-ren of the Twelve had visited and held good meetings in the settle-ments in other parts of the Stake, they had enjoyed much of the Spirit of the Lord. Said many of the say-ings of the Prophets were being ful-filled, and that God our Father, and the Lord Jesus, and the ancients who have held the Holy Priesthood, were with the First Presidency, the Twelve Apostles and the Quorums of the Holy Priesthood, and the thousands of the lesser Priesthood. These with the thous-ands of young men and children that are growing up to take the places of those that are now operat-ing in the Church and Kingdom ofGod, are a power in the earth. There is no trembling of the knees amongthose who are faithful; there is a power behind them that nerves them up to their duty. Referred to some of the ancient prophecies; said that in none of them had it been stated that the Kingdom of God should be overthrown in this dispen-sation. The Lord has set his hand to fulfil his promises to Israel. The word of the Lord to us is, turn to the house of Israel, I feel it my right to call in the Seventies to rise up as men and purify themselves and magnify that Priesthood that has been placed upon you."Exhorted the Saints to prepare for the great work before them and slacken not their hands in helping forward the Temple.

 Pima Arizona.March. 5. 1898.Wilford W. Woodruff.President of the Church ofJesus Christ of Latter Day Saints,Salt Lake City,Utah.Dear Brother: Your communication of the26th of Feb. ult. In answer I will say that I amwilling to do all in my power to aid in the promulgation of the ever lasting oGospel. I am a weak frail mortal but with the help ofGod I will do my duty. I think there areno obstacles in the way of going at present.I am very truly,your brother in thegospelThomas PrestonJohn Taylor Bishop 
 Afternoon, Elder Wilford Woodruff dwelton the dealings of God with man; his immuta-bility and unchangeableness of character,treated on the subject of the rewards and pun-ishments that will be dealt out to the childrenof men at the great day of judgment. Hethen reviewed the perseverance and diligenceof the Prophets of God who lived anciently,and exhorted the people to imitate the gooddeeds of all good men, and called their atten-tion to the blessings in store for the faithful;treated on the narrowness of the road to lifeand the broadness of the way to death, the un-ceasing opposition to the things of God in all ages, bore testimony to the Divine authenticityof the Book of Mormon, that Joseph Smith was a Prophetâ€”God's vicegerent on the earth, and that all the keys, powers, privileges and bless-ings possessed by that holy man were with his successor in office. 
 In the afternoon, Elder W. Woodruff spokeof the importance of the great work of the lastdispensation, the sending forth to the nationsthe fullness of the gospel of Christ; alluded tothe fulfillment of prophecy; the dispositionsof all men to cling to this world and to thislife on account of not knowing the reward be-yond the veil, and concluded by showing theanxiety of men to get into power for the shortperiod of 4 years, and how much more anxiousthe Latter Day Saints should be to secure thepower, authority and blessings of a more dur-able character. 
 Elder W. Woodruff expressed thehope that the Saints would be profitedby this Conference. We have had preaching enough to build up a dozen Zions, if the Saints only remembered and practiced what they heard. Whatjoy and consolation it would have beento Joseph Smith, if he could have had a vision of the condition of the church to-day. President Young is simplycarrying on the work the foundationof which was laid by the Prophet Jo-seph. He spoke of the desire of newrevelation, but said we had not yet obeyed and carried out those revelations which the Lord gave in the rise of the Church; had wasted money enough intea, coffee, tobacco, liquor, etc., to havebuilt up a big Zion in these mountains.We must learn to obey what the Lordhas told us before we can expect him to impart more to us. We must learn toco-operate in our mercantile, manufac-turing, farming and mechanical pur-suits, before we can be prepared to re-ceive all the Lord has in store for us.He said the Lord has determined to have Zion built up on earth, and no power can can prevent it, and if He could not find men and women now on the earth to carry out his purposes, He would send them from the spirit world. He dwelt upon the blessings of the sealing power, contrasting our position as Latter-day Saints, with that of the millions who have lived without the Priesthood during the last 1,700 years, having no claim upon their husbands, wives, or children in the eternal worlds.He spoke very interestingly on a va-riety of subjects, such as public and pri-vate prayer, kindness to our families,wives, children, friends and even the brute creation; to be just, merciful and kind in our government, showing the folly of men quarreling with their wivesor with each other; and concluded by urging the Saints to prayerfulness and integrity, not to be ashamed of their religion, or any of the revelations of the Lord; but to study them and seek to understand them.

 REMARKS Made at the Semi-Annual Conference. in the Tabernacle, Salt Lake City, Utah, Tuesday Afternoon, October 5th, 1897, by PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF.I feel thankful to God my Heavenly Father that I have lived to see the day when I have one of my own pos-terity called to this officeâ€”a privilege which all my predecessors, presidents and counselors, who are in the spiritworld, have had. Their sons are sit-ting before me here. I need not men-tion them; you know them yourselves. I have had this desire in my heart, and the Lord has granted it unto me, and I am very thankful for it. I am satisfied that these two young men wehave called will magnify their calling. I am satisfied that it is in their hearts to do it.I want to remark here the difference â€”I was thinking of it while the breth-ren were talkingâ€”between the posi-tion of my son and our brother here and my position when I was called to the Apostleship. While in the worst apostasy we ever had in this Church,when Apostles and leading men were fighting the Prophet of God, the Lord told me to rise up, choose a companion, and go to Fox Islands. A great deal that I have done, and in my missions, I have been led by inspiration of Al-mighty God to do. I knew no more what was on Fox Islands than I knew what was on Kolob. I chose Brother Johnathan H. Hale as a part-ner. We went through Canada, and there met John E. Page. who was la-boring there. We administered to one woman that was possessed of thedevil, which was cast out. We healedthe sick, and the blessings of Godwere with us. We crossed on LakeOntario, and from there down to Al-bany, and Farmington, my nativeplace. I there met my father and my mother. It was the first time I had seen them since I had been a Latter-day Saint. I held a meeting among them. I baptized my father, my step- mother, my sister, several uncles and aunts, and organized a small branch of the Church, composed of all my relatives except oneâ€”a Methodistpreacher, who was boarding at my father's house. Old father Smith told me, when he blessed me, that I should bring all my father's house into the Church. I certainly baptized every-body that was in the house at the time I was there. I then went on myway to Fox Islands. When I got thereI found two congregationsâ€”a Baptist minister, a meeting house, a Baptist congregation, on the north island; aMethodist minister,  a Methodist con-gregation, without any meeting house, on the south island. I commenced preaching there, and very soon saw why the Lord had sent me there. There was a people there wishing for the ancient order of things. I bap-tized most of those congregations. Without dwelling upon it, I will say I baptized over 100 while there.While in the ministry there I re-ceived a letter from Joseph Smith, the Prophet of God, in which he told me that the Lord had given him a revela-tion, and named to me the personsthat were called to fill the places of those who had fallen. My name was among them. He said that he wanted me to gather up the Saints I had bap-tized and bring them to Zion. What were the circumstances? I was on anisland of the sea. There was not ahorse or an ox on the island. There was not a man or a woman that knew how to harness a horse. I told one of the brethren, who had some money, that we must furnish a train of horses, wagons, harness, etc., and heproposed to advance the money for that purpose. He went with me and we bought about fifty horses; and then I had to match these horses, andget harness to fit them. I went to a wagon-maker and engaged twenty or twenty-five wagons. I did this in order to prepare the people to go with me, according to the words of the Prophet. I arranged everything, agreed with this brother to furnish the money, and left in advance with the under-standing that they were to leave the first day of September. The letter to me was dated the first of August. Iwent to Maine, as my wife was there with her first child. I waited for this company to come to me, but they didnot come till the first of October. We had then to travel from Maine to Mis-souri through snow, rain, and mud. However, we passed through it all,and got up there, according to the com-mandment of the Lord to me.That was the way I was called to the Apostleship, and what I had to go through. I have felt from that day to this that it has been good to serve the Lord, good to honor God and to obey His commandments. No matter what we may be called to do, or what officewe may be called to fill, if we trust in God and do our duty, we will be car-ried through. Of course, I am here among you now. But I have been on the sick list a good while. Still the Lord has blessed me, and I have got back to my former state, in a measureof health and strength. How long the Lord will permit me to live I do notknow anything about; but I have to acknowledge the hand of the Lord in all these affairs with myself. I have been edified at the teachings that havebeen given us at this Conference. What President Smith has said, what President Cannon has said, is true. They have spoken upon principles that we should lay to heart.I tell you, brethren and sisters, the God of heaven has set His hand to build up Zion, in fulfillment of all the revelations of God to man from the days of Father Adam down to this day. The counsels that have been given here today are just and true, and we ought to observe them. I can-not sin, you cannot sin, we cannot turn from the commandments of God in anywise, but we are the losers byit. Again, I will say to this congrega-tion, God Almighty will afflict these Latter-day Saints if they do not pur-sue the course they are called upon to pursue. The Lord will build up Zion and carry out His purposes; but we will be chastised unless we listen to the counsels of the servants of God. If these Latter-day Saints turn to the right or the left, on political questionsor on other principles, to separate themselves one from another and from the commandments of God, the LordAlmighty will hold them responsible, and they will be chastised for doing it. I know this as well as I know I am alive, I am anxious for the salvation of the Latter-day Saints. I do not know anything about what you are on politics, but we should be united to-gether and labor together to build up Zion. We have been called from the nations of the earth to do that; and if we do not do it, the judgments of Almighty God will rest upon us. I feel myself that the time has come when we ought to look around and about ourselves, and see what we are doing and what we should do. My prayer to God is that we may open our eyes to see, our ears to hear, ourhearts to understand the word of the Lord and the responsibilities we are under. We stand here, a little handful of men and women in the eyes of the world, but we are called to build up Zion.Here we have four Temples, thankthe Lord our God! Into those Templeswe enter and redeem our dead. We have blessings which have never been given to any other generation since the days of Jesus Christ and the Apos-tles. The Lord has raised up a people for this purpose. You hold the keys ofthe destiny of your fathers, yourmothers, your progenitors, from gen-eration to generation; you hold the keys of their salvation. God has putthat power into your hands. But if we do not do what is required of us in this thing, we are under condemnation. If we do attend to this, then when we come to meet our friends in the celestial kingdom, they will say, "You have been our saviors, because you had power to do it. You have attend-ed to these ordinances that God has required."I will say to this congregation that the very men whom God raised up to lay foundation of the Americangovernmentâ€”those noble men, fromWashington downâ€”have been to men in these Temples and required the or-dinances of the House of God at their hands in their behalf. They have toldthem the position they occupied in the spirit world, and those men have goneforth and fulfilled these requests, and those noble men have recieved the ordinances of the House of God. A great many things have been required of us as a people, and as far as we have fulfilled them, so far we are justi-fied. But do not let us lose the holdwe have got. Do not let us turn our backs upon the commandments of God, and do those things that will place us in difficulties in days to come.The eyes of the heavens are over us; the eyes of God himself, the eyes of

 PRESIDENT WILFORD WODRUFF said: I want to say to these two youngmenâ€”Elders Cowley and Woodruffâ€”that they are called to occupy a very important position, a position of very great responsibility. And we hope and trust that these young men may have the spirit and power of their calling and Priesthood and Apostleship. That they may be enabled to magnify and fulfill the duties required at their hands.We will give our brethren an oppor-tunity to express themselves now with regard to this subject, their views of the kingdom of God, and the Priesthood unto which they have been called, and the purposes in magnify-ing the duties now resting upon them by the vote of the House of Israel.Elders Matthias F. Cowley and Abraham Owen Woodruff, on invita-tion of President Woodruff, expressed their willingness to accept the respon-sibilities placed upon them, and to magnify the calling of the Apostle-ship. They had not sought such pre- ferment, although their advancement to that position had been predicted by the servants of God. Each asked the assistance of the Saints in their la- bors, and bore a strong testimony to the truth of the work of God.PREST. WILFORD WOODRUFFrelated some of his experiences when first called to the Apostleship, recount-ing the difficulties he encountered ,and their good effects upon him. He also spoke approvingly of the dis-courses of the brethren who had spok-en during the Conference, and gave profitable instructions on a variety of subjects.The choir and congregation sang: "We thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet." 
 PRESID'T WILFORD WOODRUFF.I feel very thankful this morning athaving the privilege of meeting so many of the Latter-day Saints in this the sixty-eighth annual Conference of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I had fears that I should not be able to attend this Conference, as I have been quite unwell the past month; but the last day or two I have been blessed with better health. It is a great satisfaction to me to have this privilege; and I am satisfied in my own mind that there are many, includ-ing the Prophet Joseph Smith and others of the leaders of the Church in the spirit world, who are quite as deeply interested in the Conferences and our work today as we can be our-selves. And I hope that while we are together we may have the enjoymentof the Spirit of God, and that our minds may be open, and our teachings and instructions may be led in that channel which will be to the edifica-tion of the Saints and the benefit of usall.The signs of the times show that the Lord has not forgotten His promises given through the inspiration of the Prophets and Apostles in days that are past and gone. There has been a great change in the world with regard to Mormonism in the last year of our lives, and there has been a great in-crease of the labors of the Elders of Israel among the nations of the earth,where they have been called to travel. And I hope and trust that we may be in a condition that we may compre-hend and understand our duties today,and what there is lying before us; and all that we have to preform in order to do the will of the Lord and carry out His purposes in placing us on the earth.I hope and trust that the Spirit of God may be with us all; not only those who speak and teach during Confer-ence but also those who hear. I pray to God that His Spirit may be over us, that our minds may comprehend ourduties during this Conference, and allthose things required at our hands;and that we may be true and faithfulwhile we dwell in the flesh; and whenwe are called to give an account of the deeds done in the body, that we may feel justified in the blessings of God that have been given unto us, and in the privileges we have been able to enjoy in our day and generation. I say, God bless you; and I pray for His Spirit to rest upon the Saints of God,and those who may address us. This is my desire in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

 PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFFStrange personal experiencesâ€”Preserved by therevelations and power of Godâ€”Incidents of aremarkable ministryâ€”Great change coming overthe earthâ€”The work of God progressing.-[At President Woodruff's request,President Cannon read the 1st Sectionof the Book of ##Doctrine and Covenants 1|Doctrine and Cove-nants##.]-I want the attention and the prayersof the Saints who have assembledupon this occasion.

 PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFFPRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFFOrigin of Zion's campsâ€”Notable prophecy byJoseph Smithâ€”Christ to come to the Saints in the mountains.In 1833 the Church of Jesus Christ ofLatter-day Saints was driven out ofJackson County, Mo., for the word ofGod and testimony of Jesus Christ.There Bishop Partridge was tarredand feathered by the mob. That wasthe time of the falling of the stars inthat country. Soon afterwards Bish-op Partridge called for volunteers togo to Kirtland to see the Prophet.Two men volunteered out of those whohad been driven from Jackson County.One was Parley P. Pratt and the otherwas Lyman Wight. They went toKirtland and laid before the Prophetthe circumstances, and the Prophetcalled these two men, and others, togo abroad and gather up the strengthof the Lord's house and to preparethe camp of Zion. Parley P. Prattcame to my house. I had just beenbaptized. I was engaged for a year infurnishing lumber by contract. ParleyP. Pratt told me it was my duty tolay aside all my temporal matters, goto Kirtland, and join Zion's camp. Iobeyed his counsel. I arrived in Kirt-land on Saturday and there met withJoseph and Hyrum Smith in the street.I was introduced to Joseph Smith. Itwas the first time that I had ever seenhim in my life. He invited me hometo spend the Sabbath with him, and I did so. They had meeting on Sunday.On Sunday night the Prophet calledon all who held the Priesthood togather into the little log school housethey had there. It was a small house,perhaps 14 feet square. But it heldthe whole of the Priesthood of theChurch of Jesus Christ of Latter-daySaints who were then in the town ofKirtland, and who had gathered to-gether to go off in Zion's camp. Thatwas the first time I ever saw Oliver Cowdery, or heard him speak; thefirst time I ever saw Brigham Youngand Heber C. Kimball, and the twoPratts, and Orson Hyde and many others. There were no Apostles in theChurch then except Joseph Smith andOliver Cowdery. When we got to-gether the Prophet called upon theElders of Israel with him to beartestimony of this work. Those thatI have named spoke, and a good manythat I have not named, bore their testimonies. When they got throughthe Prophet said, "Brethren I havebeen very much edified and instruct-ed in your testimonies here tonight.but I want to say to you before theLord, that you know no more concern-ing the destinies of this Church andkingdom than a babe upon its mother's lap. You don't comprehend it." Iwas rather surprised. He said "it isonly a little handfull of Priesthoodyou see here tonight, but this Churchwill fill North and South Americaâ€”itwill fill the world." Among otherthings he said, "it will fill the RockyMountains. There will he tens of thou-sands of Latter-day Saints who willbe gather in the Rocky Mountains,and there they will open the door for^the^ establishing of the Gospel amongthe Lamanites, who will receive theGospel and their endowments and the^blessings^ of God. This people will gointo the Rocky Mountains; they will there build temples to the Most High.They will raise up a posterity there,and the Latter-day Saints who dwellin these mountains will stand in theflesh until the coming of the Son ofMan. The Son of Man will come tothem while in the Rocky Mountains."I name these things because I wantto bear testimony before God, angelsand men that mine eyes behold theday, and have beheld for the last fiftyyears of my life, the fulfillment of that prophecy. I never expected to seethe Rocky Mountains when I listenedto that man's voice, but I have, anddo today. I will say here that I shallnot live to see it, you may not live tosee it; but these thousands of Latter-day Saint Children that belong to the Sabbath schools, I believe many ofthem will stand in the flesh when theLord of Jesus Christ visits the Zion ofGod here in the mountains of Israel.And while I bear testimony beforeGod, angels and men, that mine eyesbehold the fulfillment of the revelationgiven that night, I just as much be-lieve the remaining part of it will be fulfilled as I stand here in the flesh.I rejoice at seeing the progress of thework that lies before us. There is agreat work before this people in thefulfillment of these prophecies that 
 every Prophet and Apostle in the spirit world, are watching you, watch-ing this Priesthood, to see what they are doing and what they are going to do. It is of far more importance than we realize and comprehend. Let us awake to the ordinances of the House of God and do our duty, that we may be justified, for Christ's sake. Amen. 
 Prest. Wilford Woodruff was hayppy to be with us. "Were the vision open concerning what lies before you, no one would wonder why the call is made for you to take a part. The Saintsthemselves even do not comprehend what lies before them, the nation and the world. No power can stay the hand of Almighty God in preventing Him from fulfilling the things awaiting Zion.We are preparing the way for the coming of the Son of Man. I rejoice to hear the testimonies this morning as well as this afternoon.Arise and sShine, Oh Zion!  The Lord has set His hand to establish Zion. The Book of Mormon and the Doctrine & Covenantsare full of prophecies concerning Zion. The eyes of God, the sSon of mMan, Angels and all are open to see the work we must do. I look back to my childhood and see how the spirit of God stirred me up. I had a great anxiety to see a Prophet of God, to hear the Gospel and proclaim it. I marvel that I have lived through the generation of the Prophets.With regard to children what a blessing it is to any father and mother to see children whose hearts open to the truth. At one time in my life I had no thought of a posterity. I had thought to be a Paul and went on one mission with this in mind, but when I saw the Prophet Joseph I changed and it is now a great joy to me. I wish I had a regular army of young men who are virtuous and good and that I could bring them and command them to marry these virgins. Remember the words of Isaaiah "A Mother may forget her child, but I will not forget thee". [##Isaiah 49:15##] Call upon God in mighty prayer for He is waiting to hear and answer." 
 HEARD THE BRITISH GUNS.The people of Sugar House ward cele-brated the national day of Independ-ence yesterday, July 4, with a great parade, the reading of the Declaration of Independence and other exercises. Among the speakers were the vener-able President of the Church, Wilford Woodruff. During the course of his re-marks he mentioned that when he was about seven years old and living with his family in the state of Connecticut, a British fleet bombarded the coast. One day his father placed him on the top of a barn where he could distinctly hear the boom of the cannon of the bombarding fleet. At the time, for-eign opinion of the United States navy was that it was about worthless, but this did not prevent it from obtainingsome of the most brilliant achieve-ments of naval warfare. That was a lesson to the world thenâ€”a lesson that has been repeated at Manila and Santi-ago, never again to be forgotten. 
 Tell him his dep. is pospd to Nov. 11.Iona, Ida,  July 23, 1897 Wilford WoodruffDear Brother, I write you in reply to a letter of inquiringthat I would be ready by October, but if it is possible I would like to have my time extended to about Nov 11th, For the reason that I will be better preparedto go, I heartily accept the Indian Territory mission. Hoping that this will be in accordance with your feelings.I remain your servant Thomas B. Lee. 
 President Woodruff was then pre-sented to the audience by Mayor Clark and was received with the warmest demonstrations of applause. The ven-erable Pioneer and leader said in sub-stance:It was fifty-one years ago yesterday,a little before 11 o'clock a.m., that he drove President Young in his carriage on to the spot where the Knutsford hotel now stands. On his arrival in the valley, the speaker had, he said, one bushel and a half of potatoes in his possession. He had covenanted with the Lord that he would neither eat nor drink until they were planted, andhe kept his promise. Others of the Pioneers also had potatoes with them. They, too, promptly attended to the work of planting. And they were planted in the earth, not in the moon (dark or light) as brother Orson Prattobjected to that. (Laughter).There was a man in Nauvoo who built a carriage to suit his own fancy. It had a bed 11 feet long, and was en-tered by means of steps and door. This vehicle the speaker bought and brought to this valley. On the Monday morn-ing immediately after the arrival of the first Pioneers President Young took some of the Twelve Apostles, and with them walked on a short distance in a northwesterly direction; a halt was suddenly made and President Young, striking his cane upon the ground, ex-claimed, "Brethren, here will be the Temple of our God." "I didn't askhim," continued President Woodruff, "who told him the Temple would bethere. I didn't care. I put a stake there and the Temple is there, a monu-ment to President Young's foresightand prophetic accuracy."After passing over the ground, which is now Pioneer Square, the party en-tered wagons and started for the Point of the Mountain, which ap-peared to be about five miles to the westward. The distance, however, was much greater, being about fifteen miles. They continued on to Black Rock where President Young, plunged in the brine and took a bath, being the first Mormon to lave in its waters. He was followed by other mem-bers of the party among whom was a colored man. When the latter emerged from the waves the salt brine dried upon his skin and instead of being a black man he was perfectly white. (Laughter.) This transformation Por-ter Rockwell declared to be the first miracle performed in the valley. (Re-newed merriment). But when he washed himself in fresh water the salt disappeared and once more the white man was black. (Laughter and ap-plause.)On reaching here the Pioneers were importuned to continue their journey to California where it was believed their condition could be bettered. President Young said he knew he wasin the midst of a desert with his people, but that would make no difference. They would build a temple, a city and a commonwealth here. When the first message flashed across the the new electric means of com-munication, the words were "What has God wrought?" And so re-garding the declaration of PresidentYoung, the speaker felt constrained to say: "What has God wrought?" In these mountain vale[s] [a]re now cities and towns bedecked with temples ofworship, school houses, colleges and the various conditions of an advanced civilization.Here President Woodruff paused briefly and then said: "Wonderful changes have come to this land and people since the arrival of the Pioneers, and I want to say that the changes, the progress and increase will be just as great during the next fifty-one years as during a similar period that has just closed. The destiny of this people is before heaven and earth and noth-ing can stay it."President Woodruff then said he would speak of one incident and only one connected with the journey of the Pio-neers hither. It was suggested to him by the presence on the stand of W. C. A. Smoot, who was the youngest teams-ter in the advance guard. It occured near the Platte river. One day the little band of home and liberty seekerswere startled by seeing to the west,directly ahead of them, what appeared to be a great black cloud close to the earth. To their amazement they dis-covered on approaching nearer that it was not a cloud, but solid, mighty, moving body of buffalo, probably the greatest herd that had ever assembled in the western world. There was great danger of being crushed to death by the mighty horde. What to do was a problem. But after consultation a wedgelike column was thrown out and an opening effected in the herd. Among this animated mass of the monarchs of the mountains and plains they struggled on and on for their own personal salvation for three daysand nights. At one time Brother Smootlost a horse which got mixed up with the buffalo which were traveling not in a scattered condition but just as close together as animals could crowd together. For [a] time it seemed as though the loss would be permanent, but after a while the horse was re-covered."It always was," said President Woodruff in his closing reference to the incident, "a mystery to me why that great bady of buffalo should have gath-ered together and marched from its roaming place on the slopes of the Rocky Mountains and moved down on to the Platte. It never occured be-fore; it never occurred since, and will never occur again."As a finale to his address President Woodruff said he felt that it was his duty to give President Brigham Young the credit of having laid the founda-tion of this city and State. The streets of Salt Lake City, for instance, were the widest and most beautiful of any city on the earth. In the historic city of Jerusalem, two loaded camels foundit difficult to pass each other. In this city, thirty of those caravans of the desert could do so. President Young believed in fulfilling the commandments of God. He believed in doing things well. That was a characteristic of the Pioneers, no matter what the cost. For instance, a mountain was moved at a cost of a half million dollars for a foun-dation for the Manti Temple.
