This was repeated as it is written and if ever a shout entered the cabinet of heaven that did and was repeated by angels on high and caused the power of God to rest upon us.   (O, ye Priest of Baal. O, ye Gentile religionest O. ye inha bitants of Babylon possessing the mark of the beast what knowledge have ye of the ordinances or blessings or virtues of the house and church of God) Great and marvelous are the blessings and power of the ordinan- ces of the Lord and his gospel made manifest on these occas- ions. After being in the upper room about two hours we again joined the congregation of the saints in the lower court and the house came to order for the busi ness of the day, the veils were closed and each apartment commenced the duties of the day the washing of the feet of the anointed was the first business that was performed. The twelve assisted our presidency in washing the feet Elder Heber Kimble one of the twelve apostles attended to the washing of my feet and prophesied upon my head and pronounced me clean from the Blood of this generation this as it was with JESUS when he washed his deciples feet. great were the blessings that rested upon us in this ordinance. After the washing of feet, the veils were rolled, which brought the con- gregation into one assembly, the stand of the priesthood were still coverd with the veils the Presidency stood in the lower stand and President Joseph Smith jr arose and addressed the congregation for the term of three hours clothed with the image of GOD He unbosom'd his mind and feelings in the house of his friends. He presented many things of vast importance to the minds of the Elders of Israel. O that they might be written upon our hearts as with an iron pen to remain forever that we might practice them in our lives. That fountain of light, principle and virtue that came forth out of   ENDENTRY the heart and mouth of the prophet JOSEPH whose soul like Enoch's swelld wide as eternity I say such evidences presented in such a forcible manner ought to drive into oblivion every particle of unbelief and dubiety from the mind of the hearers, for such language sentiment principle and spirit cannot flow from darkness. Joseph Smith jr is a prophet of God rised up for the deliverance of Israel as true as my heart now burns within me while I am penning thes lines which is as true as truth itself. President Hiram Smith followed Joseph with many useful remarks he also was clothed with much of the Spirit of God. Joseph desired us to give heed to his words and teaching this once and be wise that zion and her Stakes might spedily be redeemed he instructed us to be sure and thask those that enter the Kingdom to send up their wise men to Kirtland with there money to counsel with the presidency and purchase an interit ance before they move their families or bring the poor to the places of gathering for to suffer. Also that we must keep in view the institution of the Kirtland safety society and if the Elders of Israel would be faithful and do what was in their power this once Kirtland should spedily be redeemed and become a strong hold not to be thrown down. Joseph presented us in some degree the plot of the city of Kirtland (which is the strong hold of the daughter of zion) as it was given him by vision, it was great marvelous and glorious. the city extended to the east, west, north, and south, steam boats will come puffing into the city our goods will be conve yed upon railroads from Kirtland to many places and probably to zion. houses of worship would be reared unto the most high beautiful streets was to be made for the saints to walk in Kings of the  earth would come to behold the glory thereof   ENDENTRY and many glorious things not now to be named would be bestowed upon the saints, but all these things are better imagined than spoken by the children of Jacob   President Oliver Cowder followed Hiram Smith and made but few remarks but verry appropriate, he called upon the Elders to keep within the bounds of their knowledge and to let the great myster ies of the Kingdom alone for the gentiles had not a knowledge even of the first principles of the gospel. that it was far better to preach what the people would call the small things of the Bible than to enter into the Ezekiel, and John andc.   President Sidney Rigdon next spoke and said many important things and impress'd it upon the Elders of Israel with great force and eloquence to lay to with their mights this once for the redemption of Kirtland that Israel may be safe and free and have a place to set his foot {for if we do not give heed to the word we should suffer loss}   After the Presidency closed their remarks the twelve were called upon to break bread for the multitude (as Jesus did in the days of the apostles) that they might all be filled they did so and we were all filled and was made glad while feasting with Patriarchs, Prophets, Apostles, Pasters, Teachers, and Deacons.   After the feast was closed thanks was returned to GOD with uplifted hands to heaven this being about the seting of the son all had the privilege of returning to thir homes that felt disposed and the rest might spend the night in the house of the Lord in prayer, and exoortation, praise and thanks giving. At about candle light the meeting commenced with great interest Joseph requested the congregation to speak their feelings freely and pray according to the spirit   ENDENTRY The saints began to open their mouths and they were filled with language unto edification one a prayer another exortation some a doctrin and a psalm others a toungue, some an interpretation Prophecy was also poured out upon us and all things was done decently and in order and the night was spent gloriously by the saints much of the gifts of the gospel rested upon us. One Brother clothed with the gift of tongues laid his hands upon my head and prophesied great blessing upon me another brother possessing the interpretation uttered it unto me to my joy and consolation with the many blessing pronounced upon my head he rehersed the blessing that Jacob pronounced upon the heads of Joseph and said that I should possess the blessings of heaven and of earth and be much blessed in my ministry andc. ##Genesis 48:3-4## much Prophecy was uttered upon the heads of many of the saints in other languages and was interpeted which was glorious, thus was this day and night spent  gloriously and those scenes will long be remembered Rejoice O earth and shout O heavens for the natural fruit of the tame olive tree is again manifest in the earth. the fig tree is puting forth leaves. The Church of Christ is travling out of the wilderness with her gifts and graces which edify the body of Christ. The house of God is reared in beauty and splender according to the pattern given by the vishions of heaven and the revelations of Jesus Christ O, ye gentiles come and receieve the gospel repent and be baptized for the remishion of your sins and recieve the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands and partake of the blessing of God with Israel that you may be hid under the shadow of ^the^ ALMIGHTY in the day of GODs wrath and Indignation upon babylon which is at hand.

South fox Island comes as near being without  any form or void as any land I ever saw. It would be difficult  for the best historian to give an exact description of it. It is about  10 miles long and 5 broad and it is one universal mass of rocks formed  into shelves, hills and dales cut up into necks and points to make room for  the cooves and harbours that run through and through the Island. Pop is  1000. They get their wealth entirely by fishing. Their principal stock is  sheep. Their is some small parts of the Island under cultivation, but it is  at the expense of great labour and toil. Many of the inhabitants of this  Island fish at Newfoundland and bring their fish home and dry them upon  their own flakes and prepare them for market. they supply the market  annually with great quantities of dried fish, Mackerel and boxed  herren. There is two stores, three tide saw mills. six school houses  and a small branch of the priest.

The ma jority of the people or public opinion were against us and even their were about seventy men mounted on horseback with firearms gathered together for the intention of comeing against our camp but the God of Israel frustr ated their design for while they were comeing against us the Lord rained upon them rain and great hail so that it was expedient for them to seek shelter from the storm and after the stor m they dispersed and would not go against the camp. After remaining stationary for several days the leading men of Clay County and some principle   ENDENTRY May 1834   Men of other Counties called at our camp to enquire into our motives and after a fair investigation of the subject they manifested to us that they were satisfied that we had no evil designs or intentions in our move ments or procedings. We remained in this situation visited daily by both friend and foes untill the High Priests held a council and there was a Revelation given concerning us. By this time the excite ment had in a great measure ceased and the Lord had granted us favour in the eyes of the people. We now again prepared ourselves to mo ve forward we traveled till within about two miles of Liberty then we again pitched our tents near by the house of Brother Burqett's here we remained for several days. and while here I witnessed a solemn scene previous to this time while on our journey there were disobedience and murmurings in the camp And Brother Joseph prophesied    ENDENTRY May 1834   That in consequence of these things there was a scourge awaited the Camp And as it was prophesied of so it was fulfilled for soon after we had cam ped by Brother Burkjetts we were visited by the destroying angel and 8 or 10 of our brethren were immediately lade helpless beneath the stroke. I assisted in taking care of them through the day and the night following and through the night and in the morning there continued to be new attacks. And  in the morning Joseph remarked that it was the duty of the Camp to brake up and disperse and take up their abode around among the brethren lest the Sco urge should be more severe. A reser ve was made however for ^a^ sufficient number to tarry to take care of the sick. Accordingly the camp dispersed. And Brother Seth Hitchcock was one of the number attacked with sickness and he belonging to our tent it reque ired another of our tent to take care of him   ENDENTRY And it was inconvenient for me to stay to take care of him in consequ ence of having a teem of animals to see to. And by request of Brother Hitchcock Brother Seth Ingols remained to take care of him. I left the camp grou nd and traveled about 7 miles to Brother  Lawery's Printed between lines of cursive text in Company with Elder Holmes who spent the summer with me at Elder L Wights   house and remained with him  for several days. I soon began to hear of the deaths of my Brethren which I left sick they all died which were first taken and numbers which were afterwards attacked there were about 20 in the whole which died at or about that time. Brother ^Seth^ Hitchcock and Seth ^Warren^ Ingols were among the number. Brother Ingols had been in company with me from the time I left my brothers Azmon at Richland N.Y. After remaini ng several days at brother Lawrey's Brother Lyman Wight gave me an invitation to spend the season with him accordingly I made it my home at his house and ingaged to labour with ENDENTRY  ENDENTRY July 1st 1834 with him through the season as he had taken a job to make one hundred thousand of brick and to build a dw elling house out of the same for Mr Michael Arthur, which made labour for many of the brethren I commenced labouring at Brother Wight's about the first of July I found many great and glorious privil eges here as it was the place appointed for the meeting of the high Council and also the Elders Council and Courts to tra nsact all their business. This high Coun cil of high Priests was esstablished accor ding to the will of God by his Joseph Servent Joseph about the first ^organized the High Council on the 3d^Cancellation and insertion in red ink. of July 1834. before his return to the east. And it is a great benefit to the inquireing mind to be privileged of attending these counsels as it is the privilege of the Cou ncil to recieve the word of the Lord con cerning all subjects that are brought before them to be decided or investigated that immediately concern the church   ENDENTRY On points of the gospel. And in fine those councils which God hath app ointed in these last days are in the first degree the most instructive and inter esting to the honest enquirer after truth light and intelligence that this generation of the human family hath access to.   I continued to labour with a number of my Brethren at Brother Wight's through the summer and fall. We had preaching occasionally through the summer from persons who were appointed by the council to teach. And seperate from those meetings the branch of the Church by Brother Lyman Wight's met together at his house on the Sabbath for the purpose of breaking bread and exhorting one another It was a practice for any who was to be ordained to the ministry to have the voice of the branch of the Church in which they were living before they were recommended to the high Council for ordination. It was at one of these meetings that   I wrote 12 Letters While holding the Office of A Teacher   ENDENTRY November 5th 1834   Brother Lyman Wight called a vote to recommend Brother Stephen Winch ester, Heman T Hide and myself to the high council for ordination it was a full vote and at the next meeting of the high council we were recommended by Lyman Wight, Amasa Lyman Zebedee Colton all high priests to the council and there was a vote taken and carried by the high council to ordain us priests. And Brother Simeon Carter was appointed to ordain us and we were ordained on the 5th day of November 1834.   Written in red ink and upside down On the 3rd day of July I attended the Meetig at Joseph Smith the Prophet organized the High Council Joseph was clothed with the power of God He chastised David Whitmore and others for unfaithfolnes, said their hearts were not set upon the building up the Kingdom of God as they should be. after He was chastised He was set apart under the hands of Joseph to Preside over the Land of Zion.
