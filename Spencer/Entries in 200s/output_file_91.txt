 nothing for or against the man.  It was the judgment of myself  and Counselors that he should  remain here a while and  prove himself, and get better  acquainted with the duties  and functions of an Elder, before  going on a mission.

I can only do  so to this extend.    As ever  Your Brother in the   Gospel    Orson F. Whitney  Bishop 18th Ward

During the recent organization   of our stake I was called to labor   in the Superintendency of the Sunday   School. My whole heart & soul is   in the work for I feel & know   that there is not a better & more   beneficial work in the Kingdom   of God than the Sunday School.    I have been taught never to resign  an office in the church except to  take a higher one, therefore I can   willingly give up my position,   I trust to someone more capable, &  take the next that has been given  me.    Your letter stated that I should be   in Salt Lake City as early as   September & that the exact date   of departure would be communicated   to me hereafter.    If I am expected to be ready   sooner than September I would be   pleased to be apprizid of the fact as   soon as possible.

Wilford Woodruff,    Dear Brother,    In reply to your  communication, assigning me a mission  in Great Britain will state that I   am perfectly satisfied with the call  and will be willing to leave at the  assigned date. I have always realized  and considered that someday I would  be obligated to fill a mission and  now that the opportunity has presented  it's self am wiling to take advantage  of the same. I am young and neexper-  ienced and practically unacquainted with  the principles of the Gospel, but I know   that if I am humble and sincere and place  myself in the hands of God as an  instrument with which to spread his  Gospel among the nations of the earth  hHe will crown my efforts with success.

 Elder W. Woodruff.-- The Lord gives   unto us revelation and truth as fast as   we can make good use of them. It is a   great blessing for us to know that we   have the gospel, and not to be in doubt   or in ignorance of our true position,   which was the case before we embraced  this work. We have apostles and   prophets, a foundation upon which to   rest our faith. The position we occupy,   to-day, is vastly superior to that of the   world. We read in the Book of Mor-  mon that no nation or people will be   permitted to dwell upon this land when   the cup of their iniquity is full; when   that is the case they cannot escape being   overthrown. He quoted an instance   from the Book of Mormon, where the   Nephite nation were destroyed because   of their sins. The spirit of God is being   witheld from the nations of the earth,   because of their iniquity. This is a   good people. The Lord is striving with   them. The Spirit of the Lord rests   upon them, and they desire continually   to do right and to live in the command-  ments of the Lord. As the wicked be-  come more wicked, we should increase   in righteousness. This is the kingdom   of God and will prevail. The ancient   prophets spoke of this kingdom and   this day in which we live, when the   earth should be sanctified, and the way   prepared for the coming of the Son of   Man in the clouds of heaven. God has   given us wise men to lead us, and the   Lord reveals His secrets unto His ser-  vants the prophets. We are the sons of   Israel and the daughters of Zion, and   God is our friend; and we know that   we are right. We should seek to be-  come sanctified before the Lord, and not   to do any thing unless we are sure it is   right. It is important that we teach   our children righteous principles, for   we fathers are wearing out, and they   will have to step forth and continue the   work that we are engaged in. If   parents instil righteous principles in   the minds of their children, those chil-  dren will be affected by them through-  out all their lives. The children God   has given to this people are a great   blessing to them, and should be care-  fully reared and educated, for the Lord   is raising among us a kingdom of   priests. Children have got faith in   what their parents teach them, and   parents should not conduct themselves  contrary to what they teach their chil-  dren, that the precepts they teach may   be sustained by example. Let us pray   to our Father in heaven, for He holds   the elements in His own hands, and   can use them to hedge up the way of   the wicked. Prayer is a mighty   weapon, and we should be armed with   it, as well as with other preparations,   and thus be ready for what ever may   occur. Let us be faithful before the   Lord and prize and profit by these   visits of our President.

This is a great work, and   God requires a good people to work   with, and for this purpose the elders of   Israel have traveled through all the   world, to gather together the proper  material to work with. We now are   trying to sanctify ourselves before God,   to be worthy of our high calling, to   build up His kingdom. It is our busi-  ness to try to establish the kingdom of   God in spite of all the opposition that is   arrayed against us. He gave some ex-  cellent instructions regarding the train-  ing of children.

 Elder Wilford Woodruff.--We are   striving as the servants of God to im-  prove ourselves, our families and the   Saints. I know there is an improve-  ment. We possess the Spirit of the   Lord, and it is weaning our hearts from   the things of this world. If Pres.   Young and his friends are willing to   leave their homes and their business,   we think you should leave your labors   to come together to worship and pray   to God, and to honor Him and His   servants. There is not another set of  men on earth who are seeking to   establish the kingdom of God and   sanctify themselves and the earth upon   which they stand. If any person de-  serves respect and honor it is God and   His servants. I have lived to see the   kingdom of God established; I have   seen his prophets and apostles, and   they have taught us to receive exalta-  tion and glory in the presence of God.   If we had all the wealth of the earth at   our command, it would hold no com-  parison to the riches of eternal life   which we possess. Of all men under   the heavens we have the greatest   reason to be thankful. We ought to be   united with the President of the   church and with our Bishops, and   wives and children should be united   with their husbands and parents; and   all of us should be firmly united to God   and His cause. The children of God   are His glory, and He wishes to teach   them the knowledge of eternal life.   Our glory is our children; they are the   commencement of our kingdoms. You   should not correct your children in   anger. Mothers should seek to have   the Spirit of the Lord with them when   they are raising children. The fathers   of families are placed to preside over   them in wisdom, and should do it   under the dictations of the Holy Spirit.   We should try to rear our children by   example, and not exact from them   what we do not do ourselves. We have   got to build up the kingdom of God   and protect it. Our Father in Heaven   and the prophets and spirits of just men   made perfect are watching us and wait-  ing for us, for they who have gone be-  fore without us cannot be made perfect.   All that we are required to do is in the   building up of the kingdom, and the   more faithful we are the more we shall   desire to do the work of God, and readily   engage in everything that will beautify   the land of Zion. This course will   secure unto us the protection and bless-  ing of heaven in every trying moment   and in every difficulty. Let us seek  the Lord always, and ask Him for   everything we need, for He will be in-  quired of, and as He sees we are pre-  pared, and willing to sustain His king-  dom, He will bless us. 
 Neils A. Mork  May 18 [18]98 
 Elder Wilford Woodruffâ€”It is a great   privilege to live in this day, and to be   associated with the Saints in this dis-  pensation, in building up the kingdom   of our God. In this work it is necessary   that the Saints be taught in principles   earthly and heavenly. I look upon   the Latter-day Saints as possessing not   only the keys of the kingdom, but the   spirit of it also, to prepare them for the   accomplishment of this great work.   It is interesting to travel among this   people and mark their improvements   and the progress they are making tem-  porally and spiritually. The Lord has   a people here that will try to be moulded   in a way that He can handle them. In   our travels among the Saints this season,   we have been taught good principles by   the First Presidency and the Twelve.   We are gathered into these valleys to   be instructed and taught to build up   the kingdom, and we have a great deal   yet to learn. Israel of old was inspired   by the same spirit which inspires the   Latter-day Saints; and that Spirit pro-  duces a union among us such as has   never been excelled among any people,   according to the time they have existed   in an organized form. The revolu-  tionary fathers did not forsee the effect   of their movements upon the future.   So with the operations of Zion's Camp.   In the future, the work which they ac-  complished will be looked upon as a   mighty one; so, also, with the Mormon   Battalion. The history of the founda-  tion and progress of this church will be   more wonderful and interesting than   the history of any other people since   the world began. The heavens are full   of knowledge and wisdom, and it has   in part been revealed to us through   God's servants.    There is something God-like and   glorious in the doctrines and revela-  tions which have been given unto us   through the prophets of God; and if we   do what is enjoined upon us, we are   doing the work which we have been   appointed to perform. Inasmuch as   this is our work we should try to bend   our minds to it. We should be pre-  pared for every emergency; we cannot   know what awaits us unless we are  guided and led day by day by the Lord.   Let Him forsake us, and we could not   move forward. We are living where   we have peace, and we need not asso-  ciate with the wicked. We should lay   the counsels of God to heart, and ac-  complish all we are told to do, perform-  ing every duty. We should rejoice and   be humble before the Lord, and seek   with all our might to build up His   kindom, for in so doing we build up   ourselves. We have grown, increased   and advanced from the commencement   until now, and God will defend His   poople and His servants so far as we are  faithful. There is a union among this   people that the world dread. The   policy of the world is to be divided, but   the heavens are united and are led by   Eloheim. So the kingdom of God on   earth is a pattern of things in heaven.   May Jacob flourish, become a strong   nation and overcome evil and the works   of the devil and triumph forever,   Amen. 
 Elder Wilford Woodruff reasoned on  the inconsistency of trusting a matter  of such importance as our salvation to  the direction of God and His servants,  and yet being afraid to be dictated from  the same source on our temporal affairs.  Referring to gardening and agriculture  he said, -- "I have visited your orchards,  and am glad to see them. They are  bearing apples and peaches and apricots.  In setting out on orchard set out good  fruit trees. In sowing flax, it should   be sown thickly on rich land, and it  will yield fine lint. We must sow clean  seed of every kind we sow; and we must   fallow our lands, or weed our crops,  and mow down the sunflowers and   other weeds out of the margins of our  fields and streets. We must learn to   make our own clothing, or become  bankrupt. I have heard President  Young preach to our sisters about  making their bonnets for the last ten  years. Listen to his counsels and the  counsels and advice of others of the  servants of God and the Lord will  bless us." We have reason to have   confidence in those who have lead us  for half a century, and lead us con-  stantly in the right way. We should  have confidence in such men if we  knew comparatively nothing; but when  we may know the truth of their teach-  ings for ourselves, by the revelations of  the Spirit, our confidence is doubly  strong. The Lord will prove his ser-  vants and handmaidens, and if we are  faithful we need have no fears. 
 Elder Woodruff noticed that Mor-  monism is a living, acknowledged fact  in the earth. The wicked have a great  deal more fear that it is true than that  it is false. For years they have striven  to overthrow it, still it lives, and is  growing in power and importance. We   have no right to expect that the Lord  will do for us what we can do for our-  selves. He is blessings us with contin-  ually increasing light and knowledge,  revealing principles by which we may  become more firmly and closely united,  and requires of us that we carry out the  great work commenced for the salva-  tion of man temporally and spiritually.

 Elder Wilford Woodruff:â€”I have  been aquainted with President Young  for over thirty years as an Elder in Is-  rael, and have never heard him give  counsel that was not followed with  blessings to those that obeyed it. The  Lord has made ns [us] free agents, and it  we wish to travel the path to heaven  we must obey the laws that will guide  us there. In my visits with the Presi-  dent among the Saints I discover an in-  creasing spirit of obedience and union  among the people. The Saints should  be united in elections, as in building a  temple, or in doing anything else that  is required of them. Unless we carry  out this principle in all our acts and  labors we do not feel right and  we cannot prosper. I want to see all   the Latter-day Saints united upon the   principles of life and salvation. The  Lord has given us the Holy Priesthood   to save our ourselves, our wives, our chil-  dren and our dead. Whenever the  Saints are disunited upon anything,   their progress in holiness stops right  there. We are free agents and can go  to heaven or to hell as we please; but  upon the matter of the kingdom of God  we must be willing to united as one  man if we desire to receive salvation,  for it is upon this principle that the  heavens are governed. We are called  to build up this kingdom, and no  greater honor was ever conferred upon  any beings in heaven or on the earth.

 Elder W. Woodruff reasoned upon   the position of the Saints, and the con-  dition of the world. They have been   in darkness for ages, without a man in-  spired by the revelations of Heaven to   teach them, and ignorance, sin and in-  iquity abound; we have the society of   prophets and apostles who reveal to us  the principles and laws of life. It is   the right of him who presides over the   church to dictate us in all things per-  taining to the building up and guidance   of that great kingdom that Daniel said   should be built up in the last days. He   advised the people to plant trees, make   their homes comfortable, and increase   in everything good and praisworthy.

 Elder Wilford Woodruff.â€”There has   never been a time from the beginning   to this day when this kingdom has not   been on the progress. We have seen   gloomy times, but the Lord has never   deserted His faithful servants; and the   Spirit of God was with His poor, af-  flicted Saints in all their doings and   troubles. Now look at this people and   their great prosperity. Look at this   fruit here as an evidence ot it. Such   fruit cannot be raised in the best fruit  districts of the east. Who has given to   us these great blessings and this great   prosperity. It is our Godâ€”the God of   heaven. Then how faithful we should   be in keeping His laws. I am much   pleased to see the improvements you   are making here, and hope you will   continue your labors until you make   this place very desirable. The speaker   then encouraged the Saints to sanctify  themselves before the Lord, and to con-  tinue their improvements making their   homes beautiful and desirable, that   their children might have strong in-  ducements to remain at home and not   wander off where they might be led into   doing wrong.

 Elder W. Woodruff touched upon the   bondage of evil and the liberty guaran-  teed in the gospel. He spoke of the   force and power of habit, and exhorted   the Saints to so accustom themselves to   doing right that by being habituated in   it they would not be able to feel con-  tented while any duty remained unper-  formed which might be required of   them. He encouraged them to abide  the counsel of the President in attend-  ing to their temporal duties as readily   as they would if called to go on mis-  sions. 
 Elder W. Woodruff spoke of the   variety of subjects that had been treated   upon during the meetings, and reason-  ed that the Lord had chosen the best   elements he could find of which to   build his kingdom, and had sent forth   the best spirits to lead its progress. He   alluded to the work that had been done   by the Prophet Joseph, by President   Young and others, and expressed him-  self that the Saints in "Dixie" had   done well, the blessing of God having   been with them, and exhorted them to   be the friends of God. 
 Apostle Woodruff said the breth-  ren of the Twelve had visited and   held good meetings in the settle-  ments in other parts of the Stake,   they had enjoyed much of the Spirit   of the Lord. Said many of the say-  ings of the Prophets were being ful-  filled, and that God our Father, and   the Lord Jesus, and the ancients   who have held the Holy Priesthood,   were with the First Presidency, the   Twelve Apostles and the Quorums   of the Holy Priesthood, and   the thousands of the lesser   Priesthood. These with the thous-  ands of young men and children   that are growing up to take the   places of those that are now operat-  ing in the Church and Kingdom of  God, are a power in the earth. There   is no trembling of the knees among  those who are faithful; there is a   power behind them that nerves   them up to their duty. Referred to   some of the ancient prophecies; said   that in none of them had it been   stated that the Kingdom of God   should be overthrown in this dispen-  sation. The Lord has set his hand   to fulfil his promises to Israel. The   word of the Lord to us is, turn to the   house of Israel, I feel it my right to   call in the Seventies to rise up as   men and purify themselves   and magnify that Priesthood   that has been placed upon you."  Exhorted the Saints to prepare for   the great work before them and   slacken not their hands in helping   forward the Temple.

 Pima Arizona.  March. 5. 1898.    Wilford W. Woodruff.    President of the Church of  Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints,  Salt Lake City,  Utah.    Dear Brother: Your communication of the  26th of Feb. ult. In answer I will say that I am  willing to do all in my power to aid in the   promulgation of the ever lasting oGospel. I am   a weak frail mortal but with the help of  God I will do my duty. I think there are  no obstacles in the way of going at present.    I am very truly,  your brother in the  gospel  Thomas Preston    John Taylor Bishop 
 Afternoon, Elder Wilford Woodruff dwelt  on the dealings of God with man; his immuta-  bility and unchangeableness of character,  treated on the subject of the rewards and pun-  ishments that will be dealt out to the children  of men at the great day of judgment. He  then reviewed the perseverance and diligence  of the Prophets of God who lived anciently,  and exhorted the people to imitate the good  deeds of all good men, and called their atten-  tion to the blessings in store for the faithful;  treated on the narrowness of the road to life  and the broadness of the way to death, the un-  ceasing opposition to the things of God in all   ages, bore testimony to the Divine authenticity  of the Book of Mormon, that Joseph Smith was   a Prophetâ€”God's vicegerent on the earth, and   that all the keys, powers, privileges and bless-  ings possessed by that holy man were with   his successor in office. 
 In the afternoon, Elder W. Woodruff spoke  of the importance of the great work of the last  dispensation, the sending forth to the nations  the fullness of the gospel of Christ; alluded to  the fulfillment of prophecy; the dispositions  of all men to cling to this world and to this  life on account of not knowing the reward be-  yond the veil, and concluded by showing the  anxiety of men to get into power for the short  period of 4 years, and how much more anxious  the Latter Day Saints should be to secure the  power, authority and blessings of a more dur-  able character. 
 Elder W. Woodruff expressed the  hope that the Saints would be profited  by this Conference. We have had   preaching enough to build up a dozen   Zions, if the Saints only remembered   and practiced what they heard. What  joy and consolation it would have been  to Joseph Smith, if he could have had a   vision of the condition of the church   to-day. President Young is simply  carrying on the work the foundation  of which was laid by the Prophet Jo-  seph. He spoke of the desire of new  revelation, but said we had not yet   obeyed and carried out those revelations   which the Lord gave in the rise of the   Church; had wasted money enough in  tea, coffee, tobacco, liquor, etc., to have  built up a big Zion in these mountains.  We must learn to obey what the Lord  has told us before we can expect him to   impart more to us. We must learn to  co-operate in our mercantile, manufac-  turing, farming and mechanical pur-  suits, before we can be prepared to re-  ceive all the Lord has in store for us.  He said the Lord has determined to   have Zion built up on earth, and   no power can can prevent it, and if He could   not find men and women now on the   earth to carry out his purposes, He   would send them from the spirit world.   He dwelt upon the blessings of the   sealing power, contrasting our position   as Latter-day Saints, with that of the   millions who have lived without the   Priesthood during the last 1,700 years,   having no claim upon their husbands,   wives, or children in the eternal worlds.    He spoke very interestingly on a va-  riety of subjects, such as public and pri-  vate prayer, kindness to our families,  wives, children, friends and even the   brute creation; to be just, merciful and   kind in our government, showing the   folly of men quarreling with their wives  or with each other; and concluded by   urging the Saints to prayerfulness and   integrity, not to be ashamed of their   religion, or any of the revelations of the   Lord; but to study them and seek to   understand them.

 REMARKS   Made at the Semi-Annual Conference.   in the Tabernacle, Salt Lake City,   Utah, Tuesday Afternoon, October   5th, 1897, by   PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF.    I feel thankful to God my Heavenly   Father that I have lived to see the   day when I have one of my own pos-  terity called to this officeâ€”a privilege   which all my predecessors, presidents   and counselors, who are in the spirit  world, have had. Their sons are sit-  ting before me here. I need not men-  tion them; you know them yourselves.   I have had this desire in my heart,   and the Lord has granted it unto me,   and I am very thankful for it. I am   satisfied that these two young men we  have called will magnify their calling.   I am satisfied that it is in their hearts   to do it.    I want to remark here the difference   â€”I was thinking of it while the breth-  ren were talkingâ€”between the posi-  tion of my son and our brother here   and my position when I was called to   the Apostleship. While in the worst   apostasy we ever had in this Church,  when Apostles and leading men were   fighting the Prophet of God, the Lord   told me to rise up, choose a companion,   and go to Fox Islands. A great deal   that I have done, and in my missions,   I have been led by inspiration of Al-  mighty God to do. I knew no more   what was on Fox Islands than I   knew what was on Kolob. I chose   Brother Johnathan H. Hale as a part-  ner. We went through Canada, and   there met John E. Page. who was la-  boring there. We administered to one   woman that was possessed of the  devil, which was cast out. We healed  the sick, and the blessings of God  were with us. We crossed on Lake  Ontario, and from there down to Al-  bany, and Farmington, my native  place. I there met my father and my   mother. It was the first time I had   seen them since I had been a Latter-  day Saint. I held a meeting among   them. I baptized my father, my step-   mother, my sister, several uncles and   aunts, and organized a small branch   of the Church, composed of all my   relatives except oneâ€”a Methodist  preacher, who was boarding at my   father's house. Old father Smith told   me, when he blessed me, that I should   bring all my father's house into the   Church. I certainly baptized every-  body that was in the house at the   time I was there. I then went on my  way to Fox Islands. When I got there  I found two congregationsâ€”a Baptist   minister, a meeting house, a Baptist   congregation, on the north island; a  Methodist minister,  a Methodist con-  gregation, without any meeting house,   on the south island. I commenced   preaching there, and very soon saw   why the Lord had sent me there.   There was a people there wishing for   the ancient order of things. I bap-  tized most of those congregations.   Without dwelling upon it, I will say I   baptized over 100 while there.    While in the ministry there I re-  ceived a letter from Joseph Smith, the   Prophet of God, in which he told me   that the Lord had given him a revela-  tion, and named to me the persons  that were called to fill the places of   those who had fallen. My name was   among them. He said that he wanted   me to gather up the Saints I had bap-  tized and bring them to Zion. What   were the circumstances? I was on an  island of the sea. There was not a  horse or an ox on the island. There   was not a man or a woman that knew   how to harness a horse. I told one of   the brethren, who had some money,   that we must furnish a train of   horses, wagons, harness, etc., and he  proposed to advance the money for   that purpose. He went with me and   we bought about fifty horses; and   then I had to match these horses, and  get harness to fit them. I went to a   wagon-maker and engaged twenty or   twenty-five wagons. I did this in   order to prepare the people to go with   me, according to the words of the   Prophet. I arranged everything, agreed   with this brother to furnish the money,   and left in advance with the under-  standing that they were to leave the   first day of September. The letter to   me was dated the first of August. I  went to Maine, as my wife was there   with her first child. I waited for this   company to come to me, but they did  not come till the first of October. We   had then to travel from Maine to Mis-  souri through snow, rain, and mud.   However, we passed through it all,  and got up there, according to the com-  mandment of the Lord to me.    That was the way I was called to   the Apostleship, and what I had to go   through. I have felt from that day to   this that it has been good to serve the   Lord, good to honor God and to obey   His commandments. No matter what   we may be called to do, or what office  we may be called to fill, if we trust in   God and do our duty, we will be car-  ried through. Of course, I am here   among you now. But I have been on   the sick list a good while. Still the   Lord has blessed me, and I have got   back to my former state, in a measure  of health and strength. How long the   Lord will permit me to live I do not  know anything about; but I have to   acknowledge the hand of the Lord in   all these affairs with myself. I have   been edified at the teachings that have  been given us at this Conference.   What President Smith has said, what   President Cannon has said, is true.   They have spoken upon principles   that we should lay to heart.    I tell you, brethren and sisters, the   God of heaven has set His hand to   build up Zion, in fulfillment of all the   revelations of God to man from the   days of Father Adam down to this   day. The counsels that have been   given here today are just and true,   and we ought to observe them. I can-  not sin, you cannot sin, we cannot   turn from the commandments of God   in anywise, but we are the losers by  it. Again, I will say to this congrega-  tion, God Almighty will afflict these   Latter-day Saints if they do not pur-  sue the course they are called upon to   pursue. The Lord will build up Zion   and carry out His purposes; but we   will be chastised unless we listen to   the counsels of the servants of God.   If these Latter-day Saints turn to the   right or the left, on political questions  or on other principles, to separate   themselves one from another and from   the commandments of God, the Lord  Almighty will hold them responsible,   and they will be chastised for doing it.   I know this as well as I know I am   alive, I am anxious for the salvation   of the Latter-day Saints. I do not   know anything about what you are on   politics, but we should be united to-  gether and labor together to build up   Zion. We have been called from the   nations of the earth to do that; and   if we do not do it, the judgments of   Almighty God will rest upon us. I   feel myself that the time has come   when we ought to look around and   about ourselves, and see what we are   doing and what we should do. My   prayer to God is that we may open our   eyes to see, our ears to hear, our  hearts to understand the word of the   Lord and the responsibilities we are   under. We stand here, a little handful   of men and women in the eyes of the   world, but we are called to build up   Zion.    Here we have four Temples, thank  the Lord our God! Into those Temples  we enter and redeem our dead. We   have blessings which have never been   given to any other generation since   the days of Jesus Christ and the Apos-  tles. The Lord has raised up a people   for this purpose. You hold the keys of  the destiny of your fathers, your  mothers, your progenitors, from gen-  eration to generation; you hold the   keys of their salvation. God has put  that power into your hands. But if we   do not do what is required of us in   this thing, we are under condemnation.   If we do attend to this, then when   we come to meet our friends in the   celestial kingdom, they will say, "You   have been our saviors, because you   had power to do it. You have attend-  ed to these ordinances that God has   required."    I will say to this congregation that   the very men whom God raised up to   lay foundation of the American  governmentâ€”those noble men, from  Washington downâ€”have been to men   in these Temples and required the or-  dinances of the House of God at their   hands in their behalf. They have told  them the position they occupied in the   spirit world, and those men have gone  forth and fulfilled these requests, and   those noble men have recieved the   ordinances of the House of God. A   great many things have been required   of us as a people, and as far as we   have fulfilled them, so far we are justi-  fied. But do not let us lose the hold  we have got. Do not let us turn our   backs upon the commandments of   God, and do those things that will   place us in difficulties in days to come.    The eyes of the heavens are over us;   the eyes of God himself, the eyes of

 PRESIDENT WILFORD WODRUFF   said: I want to say to these two young  menâ€”Elders Cowley and Woodruffâ€”  that they are called to occupy a very   important position, a position of very   great responsibility. And we hope and   trust that these young men may have   the spirit and power of their calling   and Priesthood and Apostleship. That   they may be enabled to magnify and   fulfill the duties required at their   hands.    We will give our brethren an oppor-  tunity to express themselves now   with regard to this subject, their   views of the kingdom of God, and the   Priesthood unto which they have been   called, and the purposes in magnify-  ing the duties now resting upon them   by the vote of the House of Israel.    Elders Matthias F. Cowley and   Abraham Owen Woodruff, on invita-  tion of President Woodruff, expressed   their willingness to accept the respon-  sibilities placed upon them, and to   magnify the calling of the Apostle-  ship. They had not sought such pre-   ferment, although their advancement   to that position had been predicted by   the servants of God. Each asked the   assistance of the Saints in their la-   bors, and bore a strong testimony to   the truth of the work of God.    PREST. WILFORD WOODRUFF  related some of his experiences when   first called to the Apostleship, recount-  ing the difficulties he encountered ,  and their good effects upon him. He   also spoke approvingly of the dis-  courses of the brethren who had spok-  en during the Conference, and gave   profitable instructions on a variety of   subjects.    The choir and congregation sang:   "We thank Thee, O God, for a   Prophet." 
 PRESID'T WILFORD WOODRUFF.    I feel very thankful this morning at  having the privilege of meeting so   many of the Latter-day Saints in this   the sixty-eighth annual Conference of   the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-  day Saints. I had fears that I should   not be able to attend this Conference,   as I have been quite unwell the past   month; but the last day or two I have   been blessed with better health. It is   a great satisfaction to me to have this   privilege; and I am satisfied in my   own mind that there are many, includ-  ing the Prophet Joseph Smith and   others of the leaders of the Church in   the spirit world, who are quite as   deeply interested in the Conferences   and our work today as we can be our-  selves. And I hope that while we are   together we may have the enjoyment  of the Spirit of God, and that our   minds may be open, and our teachings   and instructions may be led in that   channel which will be to the edifica-  tion of the Saints and the benefit of us  all.    The signs of the times show that the   Lord has not forgotten His promises   given through the inspiration of the   Prophets and Apostles in days that are   past and gone. There has been a great   change in the world with regard to   Mormonism in the last year of our   lives, and there has been a great in-  crease of the labors of the Elders of   Israel among the nations of the earth,  where they have been called to travel.   And I hope and trust that we may be   in a condition that we may compre-  hend and understand our duties today,  and what there is lying before us; and   all that we have to preform in order   to do the will of the Lord and carry   out His purposes in placing us on the   earth.    I hope and trust that the Spirit of   God may be with us all; not only those   who speak and teach during Confer-  ence but also those who hear. I pray   to God that His Spirit may be over us,   that our minds may comprehend our  duties during this Conference, and all  those things required at our hands;  and that we may be true and faithful  while we dwell in the flesh; and when  we are called to give an account of the   deeds done in the body, that we may   feel justified in the blessings of God   that have been given unto us, and in   the privileges we have been able to   enjoy in our day and generation. I   say, God bless you; and I pray for His   Spirit to rest upon the Saints of God,  and those who may address us. This   is my desire in the name of Jesus   Christ. Amen.

 PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF    Strange personal experiencesâ€”Preserved by the  revelations and power of Godâ€”Incidents of a  remarkable ministryâ€”Great change coming over  the earthâ€”The work of God progressing.    -[At President Woodruff's request,  President Cannon read the 1st Section  of the Book of ##Doctrine and Covenants 1|Doctrine and Cove-  nants##.]-    I want the attention and the prayers  of the Saints who have assembled  upon this occasion. I have been sick  and very weak in my body for a  month past, and did not feel that I   would be able to attend this Confer-  ence till the day before it opened. I  have been blessed in this respect to  be with you. I desire to say some  things to you, and perhaps some  strange things, too. I feel disposed to  say something about myself, to give  you a little of the history of my life,  because of what I may want to say,

 PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF    PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF    Origin of Zion's campsâ€”Notable prophecy by  Joseph Smithâ€”Christ to come to the Saints in the   mountains.    In 1833 the Church of Jesus Christ of  Latter-day Saints was driven out of  Jackson County, Mo., for the word of  God and testimony of Jesus Christ.  There Bishop Partridge was tarred  and feathered by the mob. That was  the time of the falling of the stars in  that country. Soon afterwards Bish-  op Partridge called for volunteers to  go to Kirtland to see the Prophet.  Two men volunteered out of those who  had been driven from Jackson County.  One was Parley P. Pratt and the other  was Lyman Wight. They went to  Kirtland and laid before the Prophet  the circumstances, and the Prophet  called these two men, and others, to  go abroad and gather up the strength  of the Lord's house and to prepare  the camp of Zion. Parley P. Pratt  came to my house. I had just been  baptized. I was engaged for a year in  furnishing lumber by contract. Parley  P. Pratt told me it was my duty to  lay aside all my temporal matters, go  to Kirtland, and join Zion's camp. I  obeyed his counsel. I arrived in Kirt-  land on Saturday and there met with  Joseph and Hyrum Smith in the street.  I was introduced to Joseph Smith. It  was the first time that I had ever seen  him in my life. He invited me home  to spend the Sabbath with him, and I   did so. They had meeting on Sunday.    On Sunday night the Prophet called  on all who held the Priesthood to  gather into the little log school house  they had there. It was a small house,  perhaps 14 feet square. But it held  the whole of the Priesthood of the  Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day  Saints who were then in the town of  Kirtland, and who had gathered to-  gether to go off in Zion's camp. That  was the first time I ever saw Oliver   Cowdery, or heard him speak; the  first time I ever saw Brigham Young  and Heber C. Kimball, and the two  Pratts, and Orson Hyde and many   others. There were no Apostles in the  Church then except Joseph Smith and  Oliver Cowdery. When we got to-  gether the Prophet called upon the  Elders of Israel with him to bear  testimony of this work. Those that  I have named spoke, and a good many  that I have not named, bore their   testimonies. When they got through  the Prophet said, "Brethren I have  been very much edified and instruct-  ed in your testimonies here tonight.  but I want to say to you before the  Lord, that you know no more concern-  ing the destinies of this Church and  kingdom than a babe upon its mother's   lap. You don't comprehend it." I  was rather surprised. He said "it is  only a little handfull of Priesthood  you see here tonight, but this Church  will fill North and South Americaâ€”it  will fill the world." Among other  things he said, "it will fill the Rocky  Mountains. There will he tens of thou-  sands of Latter-day Saints who will  be gather in the Rocky Mountains,  and there they will open the door for  ^the^ establishing of the Gospel among  the Lamanites, who will receive the  Gospel and their endowments and the  ^blessings^ of God. This people will go  into the Rocky Mountains; they will   there build temples to the Most High.  They will raise up a posterity there,  and the Latter-day Saints who dwell  in these mountains will stand in the  flesh until the coming of the Son of  Man. The Son of Man will come to  them while in the Rocky Mountains."    I name these things because I want  to bear testimony before God, angels  and men that mine eyes behold the  day, and have beheld for the last fifty  years of my life, the fulfillment of   that prophecy. I never expected to see  the Rocky Mountains when I listened  to that man's voice, but I have, and  do today. I will say here that I shall  not live to see it, you may not live to  see it; but these thousands of Latter-  day Saint Children that belong to the   Sabbath schools, I believe many of  them will stand in the flesh when the  Lord of Jesus Christ visits the Zion of  God here in the mountains of Israel.  And while I bear testimony before  God, angels and men, that mine eyes  behold the fulfillment of the revelation  given that night, I just as much be-  lieve the remaining part of it will be   fulfilled as I stand here in the flesh.  I rejoice at seeing the progress of the  work that lies before us. There is a  great work before this people in the  fulfillment of these prophecies that 
 every Prophet and Apostle in the   spirit world, are watching you, watch-  ing this Priesthood, to see what they   are doing and what they are going to   do. It is of far more importance than   we realize and comprehend. Let us   awake to the ordinances of the House   of God and do our duty, that we may   be justified, for Christ's sake. Amen. 
 Prest. Wilford Woodruff was hayppy to be with us. "Were the   vision open concerning what lies before you, no one would   wonder why the call is made for you to take a part. The Saints  themselves even do not comprehend what lies before them, the   nation and the world. No power can stay the hand of Almighty   God in preventing Him from fulfilling the things awaiting Zion.  We are preparing the way for the coming of the Son of Man.   I rejoice to hear the testimonies this morning as well as   this afternoon.    Arise and sShine, Oh Zion!  The Lord has set His hand to   establish Zion. The Book of Mormon and the Doctrine & Covenants  are full of prophecies concerning Zion. The eyes of God, the   sSon of mMan, Angels and all are open to see the work we must   do. I look back to my childhood and see how the spirit of God   stirred me up. I had a great anxiety to see a Prophet of God,   to hear the Gospel and proclaim it. I marvel that I have lived   through the generation of the Prophets.    With regard to children what a blessing it is to any   father and mother to see children whose hearts open to the   truth. At one time in my life I had no thought of a posterity.   I had thought to be a Paul and went on one mission with this   in mind, but when I saw the Prophet Joseph I changed and it is   now a great joy to me. I wish I had a regular army of young   men who are virtuous and good and that I could bring them and   command them to marry these virgins. Remember the words of   Isaaiah "A Mother may forget her child, but I will not forget   thee". [##Isaiah 49:15##] Call upon God in mighty prayer for He is waiting to   hear and answer." 
 HEARD THE BRITISH GUNS.    The people of Sugar House ward cele-  brated the national day of Independ-  ence yesterday, July 4, with a great   parade, the reading of the Declaration   of Independence and other exercises.   Among the speakers were the vener-  able President of the Church, Wilford   Woodruff. During the course of his re-  marks he mentioned that when he was   about seven years old and living with   his family in the state of Connecticut,   a British fleet bombarded the coast.   One day his father placed him on the   top of a barn where he could distinctly   hear the boom of the cannon of the   bombarding fleet. At the time, for-  eign opinion of the United States navy   was that it was about worthless, but   this did not prevent it from obtaining  some of the most brilliant achieve-  ments of naval warfare. That was a   lesson to the world thenâ€”a lesson that   has been repeated at Manila and Santi-  ago, never again to be forgotten. 
 Tell him his   dep. is pospd to Nov. 11.    Iona, Ida,    July 23, 1897   Wilford Woodruff    Dear Brother,   I write you   in reply to a letter of inquiring  that I would be ready by   October, but if it is possible   I would like to have my   time extended to about Nov   11th, For the reason that   I will be better prepared  to go, I heartily accept   the Indian Territory mission.   Hoping that this will   be in accordance with your   feelings.    I remain   your servant   Thomas B. Lee. 
 President Woodruff was then pre-  sented to the audience by Mayor Clark   and was received with the warmest   demonstrations of applause. The ven-  erable Pioneer and leader said in sub-  stance:    It was fifty-one years ago yesterday,  a little before 11 o'clock a.m., that he   drove President Young in his carriage   on to the spot where the Knutsford   hotel now stands. On his arrival in the   valley, the speaker had, he said, one   bushel and a half of potatoes in his   possession. He had covenanted with   the Lord that he would neither eat   nor drink until they were planted, and  he kept his promise. Others of the   Pioneers also had potatoes with them.   They, too, promptly attended to the   work of planting. And they were   planted in the earth, not in the moon   (dark or light) as brother Orson Pratt  objected to that. (Laughter).    There was a man in Nauvoo who built   a carriage to suit his own fancy. It   had a bed 11 feet long, and was en-  tered by means of steps and door. This   vehicle the speaker bought and brought   to this valley. On the Monday morn-  ing immediately after the arrival of   the first Pioneers President Young   took some of the Twelve Apostles, and   with them walked on a short distance   in a northwesterly direction; a halt was   suddenly made and President Young,   striking his cane upon the ground, ex-  claimed, "Brethren, here will be the   Temple of our God." "I didn't ask  him," continued President Woodruff,   "who told him the Temple would be  there. I didn't care. I put a stake   there and the Temple is there, a monu-  ment to President Young's foresight  and prophetic accuracy."    After passing over the ground, which   is now Pioneer Square, the party en-  tered wagons and started for the   Point of the Mountain, which ap-  peared to be about five miles to the   westward. The distance, however, was   much greater, being about fifteen   miles. They continued on to Black   Rock where President Young, plunged   in the brine and took a bath, being   the first Mormon to lave in its   waters. He was followed by other mem-  bers of the party among whom was a   colored man. When the latter emerged   from the waves the salt brine dried   upon his skin and instead of being a   black man he was perfectly white.   (Laughter.) This transformation Por-  ter Rockwell declared to be the first   miracle performed in the valley. (Re-  newed merriment). But when he   washed himself in fresh water the salt   disappeared and once more the white   man was black. (Laughter and ap-  plause.)    On reaching here the Pioneers were   importuned to continue their journey   to California where it was believed   their condition could be bettered.   President Young said he knew he was  in the midst of a desert with his people,   but that would make no difference.   They would build a temple, a city and   a commonwealth here. When the first   message flashed across the the   new electric means of com-  munication, the words were   "What has God wrought?" And so re-  garding the declaration of President  Young, the speaker felt constrained   to say: "What has God wrought?" In   these mountain vale[s] [a]re now cities   and towns bedecked with temples of  worship, school houses, colleges and   the various conditions of an advanced   civilization.    Here President Woodruff paused   briefly and then said: "Wonderful   changes have come to this land and   people since the arrival of the Pioneers,   and I want to say that the changes,   the progress and increase will be just   as great during the next fifty-one years   as during a similar period that has   just closed. The destiny of this people   is before heaven and earth and noth-  ing can stay it."    President Woodruff then said he would   speak of one incident and only one   connected with the journey of the Pio-  neers hither. It was suggested to him   by the presence on the stand of W. C.   A. Smoot, who was the youngest teams-  ter in the advance guard. It occured   near the Platte river. One day the   little band of home and liberty seekers  were startled by seeing to the west,  directly ahead of them, what appeared   to be a great black cloud close to the   earth. To their amazement they dis-  covered on approaching nearer that it   was not a cloud, but solid, mighty,   moving body of buffalo, probably the   greatest herd that had ever assembled   in the western world. There was great   danger of being crushed to death by   the mighty horde. What to do was a   problem. But after consultation a   wedgelike column was thrown out and   an opening effected in the herd. Among   this animated mass of the monarchs of   the mountains and plains they   struggled on and on for their   own personal salvation for three days  and nights. At one time Brother Smoot  lost a horse which got mixed up with   the buffalo which were traveling not   in a scattered condition but just as   close together as animals could crowd   together. For [a] time it seemed as   though the loss would be permanent,   but after a while the horse was re-  covered.    "It always was," said President   Woodruff in his closing reference to the   incident, "a mystery to me why that   great bady of buffalo should have gath-  ered together and marched from its   roaming place on the slopes of the   Rocky Mountains and moved down on   to the Platte. It never occured be-  fore; it never occurred since, and will   never occur again."    As a finale to his address President   Woodruff said he felt that it was his   duty to give President Brigham Young   the credit of having laid the founda-  tion of this city and State. The streets   of Salt Lake City, for instance, were   the widest and most beautiful of any   city on the earth. In the historic city   of Jerusalem, two loaded camels found  it difficult to pass each other. In this   city, thirty of those caravans of the   desert could do so. President Young   believed in fulfilling the commandments   of God. He believed in doing things   well. That was a characteristic of the   Pioneers, no matter what the cost. For   instance, a mountain was moved at a   cost of a half million dollars for a foun-  dation for the Manti Temple. 
 Iona Ida, July 25 1897.    President Wilfrord Woodruff.  Dear Brother    I am very sorry   I forgot to get the Bishops   signature to to my other   communication and hope it has  not put you out any.   I will say again I would   like my time extended   if convienent ^to nov^ but I throw   my self entirely on your   wishes, and hope to be   favored with or reply soon    I remain   Your Humble Servant   Thomas B. Lee    Bishop A. J.  Stanger    (over)
