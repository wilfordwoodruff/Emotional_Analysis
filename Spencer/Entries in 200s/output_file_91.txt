The twelve assisted our presidency in washing the feet Elder Heber Kimble one of the twelve apostles attended to the washing of my feet &amp; prophesied upon my head &amp; pronounced me clean from the Blood of this generation this as it was with JESUS when he washed his deciples feet. great were the blessings that rested upon us in this ordinance. After the washing of feet, the veils were rolled, which brought the con- gregation into one assembly, the stand of the priesthood were still coverd with the veils the Presidency stood in the lower stand &amp; President Joseph Smith  and addressed the congregation for the term of three hours clothed with the image of GOD He unbosom'd his mind &amp; feelings in the house of his friends. He presented many things of vast importance to the minds of the Elders of Israel. O that they might be written upon our hearts as with an iron pen to remain forever that we might practice them in our lives. That fountain of light, principle &amp; virtue that came forth out of   ENDENTRY  soul like Enoch's swelld wide as eternity I say such evidences presented in such a forcible manner ought to drive into oblivion every particle of unbelief &amp; dubiety from the mind of the hearers, for such language sentiment principle &amp; spirit cannot flow from darkness. Joseph Smith  of God rised up for the deliverance of Israel as true as my heart now burns within me while I am penning thes lines which is as true as truth itself. President Hiram Smith followed Joseph with many useful remarks he also was clothed with much of the Spirit of God. Joseph desired us to give heed to his words &amp; teaching this once &amp; be wise that zion &amp; her Stakes might spedily be redeemed he instructed us to be sure &amp; thask those that enter the Kingdom to send up their wise men to Kirtland with there money to counsel with the presidency &amp; purchase an interit ance before they move their families or bring the poor to the places of gathering for to suffer. Also that we must keep in view the institution of the Kirtland safety society &amp; if the Elders of Israel would be faithful &amp; do what was in their power this once Kirtland should spedily be redeemed &amp; become a strong hold not to be thrown down. Joseph presented us in some degree the plot of the city of Kirtland (which is the strong hold of the daughter of zion) as it was given him by vision, it was great marvelous &amp; glorious. the city extended to the east, west, north, &amp; south, steam boats will come puffing into the city our goods will be conve yed upon railroads from Kirtland to many places &amp; probably to zion. houses of worship would be reared unto the most high beautiful streets was to be made for the saints to walk in Kings of the  earth would come to behold the glory thereof   ENDENTRY  be bestowed upon the saints, but all these things are better imagined than spoken by the children of Jacob    Hiram Smith &amp; made but few remarks but verry appropriate, he called upon the Elders to keep within the bounds of their knowledge &amp; to let the great myster ies of the Kingdom alone for the gentiles had not a knowledge even of the first principles of the gospel. that it was far better to preach what the people would call the small things of the Bible than to enter into the Ezekiel, &amp; John &amp;c.    next spoke &amp; said many important things and impress'd it upon the Elders of Israel with great force &amp; eloquence to lay to with their mights this once for the redemption of Kirtland that Israel may be safe &amp; free and have a place to set his foot {for if we do not give heed to the word we should suffer loss}    their remarks the twelve were called upon to break bread for the multitude (as Jesus did in the days of the apostles) that they might all be filled they did so &amp; we were all filled &amp; was made glad while feasting with Patriarchs, Prophets, Apostles, Pasters, Teachers, &amp; Deacons.    closed thanks was returned to GOD with uplifted hands to heaven this being about the seting of the son all had the privilege of returning to thir homes that felt disposed &amp; the rest might spend the night in the house of the Lord in prayer, &amp; exoortation, praise &amp; thanks giving.
