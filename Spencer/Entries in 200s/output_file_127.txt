Woodruff,  & Council.    Beloved Brethren:    Your ever welcome   and esteemed favors of the 14th, 20th and 28th of May   have come safe to hand and contents noted. Elder   J. W. Clawson, his wife and chilren arrived here   June 11th per Guion S. S. Alaska and left for London on   Friday morning June 13th. Your suggestions about an   organization, as the brethren had at Ann Arbor will   be suggested to them and I hope be productive of   much good. The action of the U. S. officials with   regard to our emigration was brought to my   notice in the press dispatches of the morning   papers and I wrote to Mr Tenbroeck, a copy of   which I enclose. I hope our emigration, under   the blessing of God, will not be interfered with.  We are striving to be in harmony with the laws   but it seems as though the U. S. Government was   determined to fill up their cup speedily. Our   emigration is very nicely cared for everywhere.   Mr Ramsden continues as energetic and care  ful as ever to have our emigrants well treated.  I do not know how such a rumour could   have reached you that I had released Elder   Frederick Stauffer from the Turkish Mission

Beloved Brethren:    Yesterday I had  to cable you for ten hundred pounds in conse-  quence of the heavy drafts made upon us and  a mistake in not drawing sufficient upon you  for the fourth Company. I was afraid we would  not have sufficient to pay Guion & Co for the sea  passage of the June 28th Company and drafts  were continually being presented and the money  wanted and our emigration being at a stand  still until the 2nd of August I saw we were  going to be bankrupt, and so cabled for ten  hundred, owed us by the office, to save us.  Mssrs Guion & Co have just informed us that the  Wyoming arrived safe in New York yesterday  morning—the 19th—at 5 a.m. and that they left at  3 p.m. the same afternoon. We are rejoicing in  the blessing of God attending our companies.  In conversation with Mr. Ramsden I told him  I did not know but what we would have to  quit sending companies. He asked why? do  not they go through all right? I replied yes  but there is so much prejudice against us  and the people of the States so stirred up by 
 as I had not thought of such a thing. Brother   Stauffer is quietly doing as well as any miss-  ionary who ever went to Turkey. I have for-  warded him your letter, with a letter from   myself and enclosed a five pound note   to assist him in expenses. In this weeks "Star"   which will [be] issued next Monday there is an inter-  esting letter from him under date of May 17th. It   bears postmark of a later date and would have   been published earlier but I have been away at  tending conferences and visiting. Bro. J. E. Carlisle   is away with br. Heber J. Richards & family visiting   London. Bro. Phillips is assisting me on the "Star"   He leaves on the 28th of June for Bear Lake.   He has been quite a help to me in the editorial   department. He has an excellent education   and is a gentleman, but I think rather a fiery  temper when crossed. His expressions have   to be toned down, andbut with me he has been   as humble as a child, and treated me with   a great deal of respect. I am sorry to lose   him, and he expresses sorrow to leave. But the   way has opened up for his emigration and   I would not detane him. If he continues in   the love of the gospel and true humility he will   be a great blessing to himself, and likely others.  We all join in kind love; the folks at 42 are all   well. Ever praying for the blessing of God to attend you   now and for ever, Your humble brother in the Covenant    George Teasdale

Salt Lake City, Utah.    Beloved Brethren:    On friday last,   20th inst, the following named missionaries arriv-  ed in Liverpool, per Guion S. S. Wisconsin. They spent   Sunday with us and were appointed to the Conferences   named as follows—Frederick W Chappell, to the   Manchester; James H. Clark and Richard Graham  to Leeds; John F. Merrill, Samuel S. Newton and Edmund   M. Dugdale to Newcastle; Thomas Wheatley Jr. and  Charles Cottrell Jr to Sheffield; Charles T. Black and   Prime Coleman to Norwich; Henry Moyle to Bris-  tol; James Smith to London & Edward Burton to   the Nottingham Conferences; and James H. Cook   to the Scottish Mission. These were all for the British   Mission. Anders S. Hyrup for the Scandinavian   and Joseph A. Young for the Swiss & German Mis-  sion.    On Saturday 21st June Elders George H. Baugh and   wife, Hyrum Ricks and Noah Williams returned   home per Guion S. S. Alaska, R. F. Neslen, W. Langton &   F. T. Bailey with their wives and some others going to Utah   sailed on the same vessel.    You referred to Prest J. U. Stucki being released if we   had any one to succeed him. There is only Brother 
 the newspapers against our emigration. He smiled  "oh never mind that" he said "when you cannot  send companies then we will have to try  some other way."—"You do not send emigrants  in violation of law," no paupers—no contract la-  borers—do you? he said—"No" I replied. He then  told me of an interview he once had with the  American Consul in Liverpool when Enarts tried  to stop the emigration and the Consul asked him if  the "Mormons" were of the above class &c. He is cheerful  and sanguine, has good faith our people will go  through all right so long as they honor the laws. This  we propose to do by the grace of God and continue to  trust in Him. It is His work and He will over-  rule all things to suit His glorious will. My only  anxiety is that His will may be done and His  puposes fulfilled. I think we are safe if we do His  will and keep His commandments. I believe in His  promise—"If you love me and keep my commandments  you shall prosper in the land" [##2 Nephi 4:4##]—Every Latter-day Saints  knows this to be true and they are full of thankfulness,  light & truth. Tomorow Elders Hyrum Ricks, Noah  Williams and Geo. H. Baugh return to Zion per S. S. Alaska  Brother Baugh's wife has been here on a visit returns with  him. Bros R. F. Neslen, Wm Langton & wife Bailey &  wife, Wm. Knowles, Bro Baugh's wifes brother, Eliza Jones and some  relatives of Wm Langton & wife are going to accompany this party  of returning missionaries and visitors. All seem to have been benefit  ed by their trip. We are all well at 42 and join in kind love    Your brother  George Teasdale. 
 Theo. Brandley and if he was taken from the   office to preside, he would need some one to succeed   him. Bro Stucki spoke of a brother residing at   Elsinore who was very capable. His name is   Richard Haag. He also said he could use   twelve good missionaries in the Swiss and Ger-  man mission if he had them. There has been   a revival in that mission where good competent   Elders are. We all want good competent Elders; like   everything else there is always room at the top. The   Elders generally ^when they arrive here^ do not know much about the   principles themselves, and by the time they learn   to teach others, and are useful in the ministry,   it is time for them to go home; especially is this so   where they have to learn the language. If it meets   your approbation Prest Stucki will leave for home   with the next company from the Swiss and   German mission, and Bro. Brandley will be ap-  pointed to succeed him. Elder C. D. Fjeldsted ar-  rived here November 13th 1886 and Elder Jas. Leaing   October 13th, 1886. Will you kindly inform me if   you think they should return home. They are   bootth very excellent missionaries and of course   we hate to part with them, and they are willing to   stay until it is deemed wisdom for them to re-  turn. I would like your council on the matter   that I may be satisfied. Men in the enjoyment of   the Holy Spirit only want to be where the Lord wants   them, and they have joy in their missions despite the dis-  couraging circumstances. Your brother,    George Teasdale

Beloved Brethren:    I have the honor  of submitting to you, by this mail, our month-  ly statement, for the past month, July.    Since receiving your esteemed favor of June 27,  and later communications, we have endeavored  to fulfil your expressed wish, to arrange  the affairs of the mission, so that when our  successor arrived, we could turn over the bu-  siness of the mission to him, and make all  the necessary explanations concerning its  details &c. This will account for our dis-  bursements being rather heavy during the  last month. We paid Fazakerleys bookbinding  bill of £96.12.0, our takxes £9.15.4, House cleaning  Whitewashing &c £4.3.5, Gasbill £2.6.4, Coal £2.10.6 and  so forth. We shall do our best to have every-  thing in good shape to turn over to our suc-  cessor, all bills paid, and the house clean and  comfortable. We were very much pleased with  your reconsideration of the brother who should  succeed me, and acknowledge the hand of God  in it. I am thankful for the kindly consider-  ation you have had for me, and very much 
 appreciate your friendship and brotherly love.  I am very thankful to God for His sustaining grace.  Notwithstanding all the anxieties, cares and  tribulations, I have enjoyed the experience of  this mission exceedingly, and what little good  may have been done, to God be the glory.  We  have sought His counsel and He has guided.  The broadcast distribution of tracts and prin  ted matter will be like the "bread cast upon  the waters," already do we hear of a spirit of  inquiry being madenifest. I have good faith in  printers ink. The Lord is doing His own work,  and it is not by wisdom of man, but by His  Spirit is He accomplishing His mighty purposes.  It is a great pity there are so few who believe God.  I shall be pleased to receive any instructions  you may have for me as to my future. We  are all reasonably well at 42, and join  in love to yourselves, our brethren of the Twelve,  and the brethren with you in the office. May  peace and blessing be thine    Your brother in the Kingdom of patience  George Teasdale    [sideways text] Geo. Teasdale  13 Aug. 1890 [end of sideways text] 
 LATTER-DAY SAINTS',  EUROPEAN PRINTING PUBLISHING  AND EMIGRATION OFFICE.    42 Islington, Liverpool,  July 19th 1890.    President W. Woodruff  & Council.    Beloved Brethren:    We had a most  excellent Conference on Sunday last at Cheltenham,  the 13th inst, and a priesthood meeting on Saturday  evening. There were 9 Elders from Utah present.  On Tuesday evening we held a fellowship meeting which  was well attended and a number of interesting  testimonies borne. On Wednesday I returned to the office  and met Elders Lorus Pratt, John Hafen and J. B.  Fairbanks en route to Paris and James J. W. Duncan  who arrived in Liverpool on Saturday night the  12th inst per Guion S. S. Nevada. They were all in ex-  cellent health and spirits. They met with us at  our Wednesday evening meeting and we had an ex-  cellent testimony meeting. Afterwards we met in the  prayer room at 42 Islington and Elder Lorus  Pratt was appointed the president of the French  Mission and set apart for that responsibility.  So we have a representation in France. Elder  Duncan was appointed to labor in the Scottish  Mission. I was acquainted with him when he was  a boy about 8 years of age in Scotland. His father  presided over the Tranent Branch of the Edinburgh  Conference in 1859 and 60; he emigrated to Utah and died 
 there. Now his youngest son 38 years of age is going to  bear his testimony in the place where once his fathers  voice was heard in defence of the Everlasting Gospel.  With this mail you will receive the financial  report of the mission for June. Bro. Jno W. Young  arrived this morning from London with David  H. Cannon and Willie Young. They leave to-day by  Cunard S. S. Umbria, all well. Bro. Edward  Burton of the late arrival of missionaries returns  home dreadfully homesick. We cannot pursuade  him. His President, Bro. Creer of Notts, and the Elders  there have labored with him but of no avail.  He cannot endure it. He leaves by S. S. Nevada  to-day. I leave to-day for Merthyr to attend a  Conference of the Welsh Mission and priesthood  meeting to night. We are all well at 42 and join  in kind love to the First Presidency and Twelve  whom we sustain in our entreire confidence  and faith and prayers night and morning  and whom may the God of Israel bless for  ever and for ever    Affectionately your brother  in the Kingdom of patience  George Teasdale    [sideways text] Geo.

President W. Woodruff,  and Council.    Beloved Brethren:    We have just witnessed  the departure of the 6th Company, of this seasons emi-  gration, per Guion S. S. Wisconsin, in charge of Elder  Leonard J. Jordan, with Isaac J. Riddle as his first  and John D. Evans as his second counsellor. Elders  Edward M. Perkins and Robert Harmon returning  missionaries. The last named returning at his own  request through family affairs, and declining health.  It is a small company of 81 souls and 4 returning  missionaries 85 Total 45 full and 19 half fares. 45  males and 40 females. We instructed Elder Jordon to  telegraph Elder Jas. Jack from New York, Norfolk,  Chattanooga, Kansas City and Denver. We have  to give the brethren in charge all instructions, as  it is a new business, or experience, to them. People  who are engaged in a business, that time and  experience have made them proficient in, are  apt to forget there was a time when they were  ignorant of it, and think all men should  have the knowledge they themselves possess. As a  general rule we know the Presidents are ignor-  ant of what is required of them in taking a com-  pany of emigrants through to Utah, and are careful 
 LATTER-DAY SAINTS',  EUROPEAN PRINTING PUBLISHING  AND EMIGRATION OFFICE.    42 Islington, Liverpool,  July 30th, 1890.    Prest Wilford Woodruff  and Council.    Beloved Brethren:    Since last writing  to you I have attended Conferences of the Welsh  and Scottish Missions. We had excellent meet-  ings which were well attended, but the reports  were not very encouraging with regard to bap-  tisms. In the Welsh Mission they had not baptized  one in six months, but in Scotland two baptisms  were reported, for the six months, and six baptisms  in July, since the 30th of June. In the six months 15,531  tracts had been distributed, 26 of the cheap edition of  the Book of Mormon had been sold, and 189 cheap Voice  of Warning. In the Scottish Mission 13,265 tracts had been  distributed by the Glasgow Tract Society, in six months,  and 14,619 by the Elders &c in their districts for three months  report, making a total of 27,884 tracts distributed, 11 Books  of Mormon sold, 5 loaned, 13 Voice of Warning sold, 8 loaned, 5 given  away by the Elders, to friends or acquaintance. There is a seem  ing indifference amongst the people generally, or if  convinced lack the moral courage to obey; Yet  the Elders are in no wise discouraged, they feel  well, and we hade most excellent meetings. The  and ^elders^ are filled with praise and thanksgiving.  There seems to be a deep rooted prejudice against 
 us, and frequently the Elders are insulted, the people re-  fusing to receive the tracts, or hold any conversation  with them. The Protestants and Catholics are holding  "Demonstrations" in the open air, and in the largest  halls. Last Sunday on Glasgow Green there was a protes-  tant demonstration, and they had to be protected by  squads of policeman, which we saw march down  to the foot of the Nelson Monument, on Glasgow Green.  We live in a momentous age.    Your favor of June 30 reached us after Elder Jas. R. Smith  had returned, through sickness and family affairs, he left  here per S. S. Wyoming July 12th, with Bro & Sister McGhie. I return  letter written for him.    Your esteemed favor of July 7 also to hand and contents  noted.    On Saturday next Aug 2 a company from the British  mission will sail, per S. S. Wisconsin, we expect about  one hundred souls. We are all well in the office; the  printers are working a "Star" ahead for their annual  holiday of one week. Bro L. R. Thomas has gone to the  Birmingham ^Conf[eren]ce^ to have three months in preaching the  gospel, previous to returning home. He has been here  going on three years, and has been very useful.    All at 42 desire to join me in kind  love to yourselves, and all in the office.    I remain,  Your brother & fellow laborer,  George Teasdale.    [sideways text] Geo.

 The Council of the Twelve Apostles, to the Breth-  ren at Winter Quarters, and esspecially to  such as shall hereafter arrive at that  place—Greeting    Beloved Brethren,    We have now  completed the organization of the Pioneer Company,   of which we are members, and whom we are  about to lead to the Mountains or over the Moun-  tains, as we shall be councilled by our Leader in  search of a resting place for ourselves, our families,  and all who desire to follow us and work Righteous-  ness; and by doing this we prove to you and to all  the world, that we do not wish to be a whit behind  the first of you, in leaving wife, children, friends, rest,   or any of the enjoyments of social life; and that we  are willing to take our full share of troubles, trials,  losses and crosses, hardships and fatigues, weariness  and watchings, for the Kingdom of Heaven's sake; and  we feel to say come calm or strife, turmoil or peace, life  or death; in the name of Israel's God we mean to   conquer or die trying: We mean to open up the way  for the salvation of the honest in heart from all na-  tions or sacrifice every thing in our stewardship, and  if we fail in the attempt, having done all we could,  Our Father will not leave his flock without a Shep-  herd.    In connection with the Pioneer Company we  have organized all in your place and vicinity who  wish to join the emigration, into companies of Tens, fifties,   and hundreds, in two divisions, with a President 
 and two Councillors to each division, with the sanction  of their respective companies, and having called the  Presidents, Councillors, and Captains of hundreds to-  gether, have advised with them and decided that  all the High Council that is necessary to be left  at Winter Quarters, after the present High Council  shall have left, will be the Presidents and Captains  of Emigration Companies.  And where the present Pres-  idents of Divisions and Captains shall remove they  will leave others similarly organized with the approval  of the brethren, or those who thus enter into the organiza-  tion.    The brethren now organized, have heard  the Word and the Will of the Lord on which this organ-  ization is founded and have given their hearty assent  unto it, and any hesitancy in carrying out their pledges  or acting in Concert with their Presidency, as they well  know will be at the loss of a glory that they ^can^ never regain,   therefore, we say that that these instructions generally  are more especially to such as shall hereafter arrive at   your place; so that they may receive the principles and  instructions that those have had, who have been with   us the past winter.    The business of the Saints at Winter  Quarters from this time is to journey West, until further  instructions: and while some will have the means to   go forward at the springing of grass, others will have   to stop and raise grain to carry with them: and  while some will come here prepared, others will have  stop and prepare for their journey: and in either case,   all preparation and organization is for journeying and  not for a permanent location at Winter Quarters, and   if any refractory members should make their appear- 
 ance, the Bishops will see that justice is done them,   and let no iniquity have place in your midst.    It is the privilege of the brethren who  remain, or arrive hereafter, to decide, but the Council  urgently recommends to them to remove the lesser houses  on to the line, of Winter Quarters, or on the borders of the  most populated blocks, so as to defend themselves, by  houses, pickets, ditches, &c against the Indians, so that  your women and children may not be insulted and  abused, and their tables robbed, while they are draw-  ing water, or gathering the fruits of their gardens or  attending to any domestic duties, in your absence.    Let the brethren labor unitedly in making  fields, fencing, planting, harvesting &c all under the di-  rection of their respective captains of Tens and Fifties, -  over whom will be the supervision of their Captains of  hundreds and Presidents who will allot to each family  all the ground they need or can till, for a garden, in  the City of Winter Quarters or its immediate vicinity—  so that all may share equally in the comforts and   luxuries of the table.    The Idler shall not eat the bread  of the laborer, therefore let a record be kept, by the   Captains of each Ten, or his clerk, how each man em-  ploys his time, from day to day; and let the same be  reported weekly to the Clerk of the division or Presi-  dency of the organization; and let one tenth of the  avails of each man's labor be appropriated for the  benefit of the poor and sick, under the direction of the  Bishops, attending to the Council of the Presidency; for  the poor ye have always with you, and the sick often:  and he who administers to them, serveth the Lord.    Your crops, and cattle will be exposed 
 to the aggression of the Omahaws, and other Indians, and  we say to you take care of them, learn to watch as  well as pray, for the farther you go West, the more   you will be exposed and if the Saints cannot watch  them safely here here, what will they do when they   get where civilzation or half civilization is unknown.   Make good fences around your corn fields, and locate  families near sufficient to watch and keep them safe,   and let the emigrants be diligent and careful to plow,   plant, and fence all they possibly can before they  start on their journey.    We advise the brethren to keep the  up the a police of their most effective men at Winter  Quarters as we have done for  [th] in an hour ye know  think not, evil may be upon you; and pray them  for their services so that they will not be obliged to  neglect your safety, for a loaf of bread, to satisfy  their hunger or that of their families.    It is highly important in this  dispensation that every brother learns his duty,   and acts accordingly: in doing which, every one who  can, will pay their herdsmen in money, flour, grain,   &c as they shall need, for their comfort, or to prosecute  their journey, and not complete compel them to urge  payment of the Sisters whose husbands are in the   army, the Widows, and poor, and let the herdsmen  be diligent in striving to deliver all the cattle &c entrust-  ed to their charge, at the proper time, to those who  are emigrating West, and such of those, as cannot  pay down, agree upon the Cattle you shall mark  as your own to be held in society, to be paid for or  delivered to you at a future day. 
 It is our wish and Council that the Em-  igration company now formed, shall follow the Pioneers,  as soon as the grass is sufficient to support the  teams, and the Presidents, and Captains will examine  and know that every soul that goes in said Com-  pany is provided with from 3 to 500 lbs of bread stuff,   or a year and a halfs, and as much more as he can  get for we know not whether we can raise corn this  summer, as we anticipate at the place of location.    Let the first Emigration company take  with them as many of the Sisters whose husbands  are in the Army, as can fit themselves out, or can be  conveniently fitted out.    It is wisdom that all the men in the  Emigration Company shall be organized into a mili-  tary body, under their respective Captains of 10s, 50s,  and 100s with Charles C. Rich as their Commander  in Chief who will see that every man is properly  armed, and ready to meet any savage encounter at  a moment's warning, taking care that caps and priming  of all firelocks are so secured as to admit of no acci-  dents: that John Scot superintend the artillery un-  der C. C. Rich—Horace S. Eldredge be marshal—  Hosea Stout Captain of the Guard on the journey  and that the guard watch during the night, and  sleep as they have during the day:    The first company will carry the  Temple bell, with fixtures for hanging at a moment's  notice, which will be rung at daylight, or a proper  time, and call all who are able to arise to prayers,  after which ringing of bell and breakfast, or ringing  of bell and departure in 15 minutes to secure the  cool of the day till breakfast time &c as the bell may 
 be needed, particularly in the night Seasons, if Indians  are hovering round to let them know you are at  your duty, and if any man acts disorderly, punish  him severely.    Whenever a Company of 75 men, who do  not belong to the present organized Company, shall  be organized so as to carry out the principles of the  Word and Will of the Lord and these instructions,  according to the Pattern, with or without families,  and provisions enough to sustain each soul 18 months,  they may come on till the 1st of July, but in all  cases, the brethren must run their own risk for food  and not depend on the pioneers, or any Company in  advance for support in the least, either for their teams,  themselves, or families, for we are credibly informed that  more than 30 souls of the Oregon Emigrants, perished  in the Mountains with hunger the last season; and  100 bushels of corn can easier bye raised near Winter  Quarters, than the 50 bushels at the foot of the  Mountains.    If a man of the 1st Emigration com-  pany, who is going to stop at your place for the  time being, should so far forget his Covenant in the  Temple, and his more recent obligations and agree-  ments as to retain his wagon or team, from the neces-  sities of the journey: it will be the duty of the Presi-  dents to instruct the captains to take the same and  apply it where necessity requires, and thus compel the  owner to do what he had previously agreed to, for as  some were compelled to come in, in Ancient days, others  must be compelled to remain in, ^in^ latter days, and men  who are taken at their word have no reason to find  fault.   For the Council,  (Signed) Brigham Young, President.  Willard Richards, Clerk

We recommend the brethren to search for a ford  across the Horn, near where said river leaves the Bluffs  of some 20 miles north of the usual ferry, or West of  Old Council Bluffs, as it will save much trouble  travel, if such a ford be found, or a good place for   a Ferry.

I have but my family  with me and they are astound-  ed at the great city of London,  Prest. Teasdale is expediting busi-  ness and expects to sail near  the first to fourth of October.    Taking leave of the saints is  very affecting, it seems like  pulling up home stackes and  the saints feel it too. I trust  the few who belong to the Church  will try and reconcile them-  selves to the change which  has taken place.    P.S. Any counsel or directions  you have for me will be thankfully  received. Trust me brethren and I  will not dissappoint you nor the Lord  with His help. Letter of appointment received.    God bless you  B. Y.

 Of course my experience is limited and I  know but few of the elders; but there is  a splendid body of missionaries in this  conference. Bro Laeny presides with dignity  and his brethren are able helps. Of course  Bro. Laeny will be released to return home  but ^we^ shall have difficulty to fill his place;  his experience is great and also his ability, at  least I think so.    Have talked with a few of the brethren  about their prospects and find that they  generally support themselves, costing them from  three to four pounds ([ohshaw]). 3 to 4 £ per. mo.  to live, which means I understand comes from  their private pockets or is sent them by their  friends. The people are pretty well "proved,"  it seems, but the Lord knows first what He is   doing.

The Lord has delivered  ^me^ out of all my distresses to date.  I trust Him  for the fuature.    Prest. Teasdale is looking usually well, a  little worn and I cannot blame him  for that.  We have been here two nights and  my wife declares she has not slept two hours  either nights.  The constant rumbleing of carts.  etc. and when they cease, all hell is let loose  from the gin palaces—a crowds that make night  hidious with their curses and howls.  I am in  the same fix ^as my wife^ but will soon settle down to the sit-  uation, no doubt we all shall get used to it   in a few weeks.    Oh, the turmoil and filth is distracting, How that  are we in the mountains    Love to Prests. Geo. Q. Cannon &. J. S. Smith and all  the brethren.  Your Brother in Christ    Brigham Young  over 
 P.S. We go to London to attend Conference tomorrow.  Bro Teasdale thinks I had better use my name  as B. Young on all ordinary occassions.

 LATTER-DAY SAINTS',  EUROPEAN PRINTING PUBLISHING   AND EMIGRATION OFFICE.    42, Islington, Liverpool,  August 16th 1890.    President Wilford Woodruff  and Council.    Beloved Brethren:    The seventh com-  pany of this seasons emigration, left here to-day,   per Guion S. S. Wisconsin, under the Presidency   of Jonas Ostlund, with A. F. Anderson, as his first   and Michael A. Hansen, as his second counsellor.  Andrew J. Aagaard, and Joseph C. Kempe, return-  ing missionaries', the first named through ill health  There are 134 souls in the company, 67 full, and   25 half fares. Included in this number are   two sisters, visitors, who have been visiting their   friends in Scotland, Sisters Janet Morris, and Dick.  They are in excellent health and spirits, and   truly faithful Latter-day Saints. Sister Clara   Johnson, and her two boys, returning from a   visit to friends; and a good sister, Mary A  Chambers, leaving all her family and going   alone to Zion, to spend her days with the Saints   of God. All the others are from Scandinavia.  They appear to be a very fine class of our  people. I met with them on Wednesday eve-  ning last, and I enjoyed much freedom   in speaking to them. The president, Bro Ostlund,  says, he has had no trouble with them at all in 
 crossing the sea. They are willing and obedient,   full of hope. Our good friend Mr Ramsden gave   the Elders two state rooms, worth at this sea-  son of the year £45.0.0 a room, had refused  passengers. The saloon and intermediate was   full but our people had the best rooms in   the ship. He kindly sent me word ^that^ on wWednesday ^that^  our company, pr. S. S. Wisconsin, in charge of Leonard   I. Jordan, arrived in New York at 7 a.m. and   left at 3 p.m., which intelligence was gratefully   received, and we praised God in His holiness. Truly   has He blessed us, and holds us in His protect-  ing care. We are surrounded with wickedness.  The Guion Co. is having a good season, I am happy   to say. They bless us and the Lord is blessing them.  Every berth in the next two ships are engaged. So   you see it does not militate against them  carrying the "Mormon" emigration. Our next com-  pany is a British company sailing September  6th. We expect the Swiss & German Saints will  join them. We are all reasonably well and join   in kindest regards and prayers for your welfare    Your brother in the covenant of peace  George Teasdale    [sideways text] Geo.

Dear Brethren:    The ninth company   of this seasons emigration left Liverpool today,  per Guion S. S. Wyoming, in charge of Elder Jens   Jensen, with Lars C. Johnson, as his first and   Eric Hogan, as his second counsellors. J. A.  Farslund and Annie Anderson, wife of Elder   Anderson who died on a mission to Denmark, were   returned as missionaries, Bro Farslund having been   engaged in the Scandinavian Office. The company   numbered 187 souls 102 full 39 half fares. There   were a few from the British Mission some   23 souls.    Elder B. Young and family arrived here on   Sep. 4th, on the 5th the passengers for the eighth   company arrived and went on board the S. S.   Wisconsin in charge of Elder J. U. Stucki with   Alfred Budge and C. Meyer as his counsellors.  That company numbered 116 souls. Elders Henry   Tuckett, John Ischi and Jacob Schweizer return-  ing missionaries. These sailed Sep 6.    We had a conference announced for Sunday   7th at London I had promised to attend   and had to leave 11.5 on Saturday the 6th a.m. 
 So when the Company was properly organized and   all the business attended to; I left with Brother  Young and family to London and attended   Conference and returned to Liverpool in time to   attend to this 9th Company. Brother Young re-  mained until to-day when he left to attend the   Norwich Conference and his family returned   to Liverpool. With this company we shall close   up our seasons business, so far as I am concern  ed. We have advertised, to send all, who have   not been prepared to go in the September   companies, that a company will leave ^here Oct 11th^ from   any part of the European Mission and we   have already a good many names. But   we shall now take stock and turn over   the business in a proper manner and send   you a balance sheet with the September   Report, which will close my labors in   the Presidency of the British Mission. We were   informed by the Guion Co. who received their   report from New York that Bro. Young would   not arrive until the next sailing of the   Alaska, and knew of no difference until   I received a letter from Bro W. C. Spence a   few days before Bro. Brighams arrival. We are   all well at 42 and join in kind love    Your brother in the Gospel  George Teasdale 
 LATTER-DAY SAINTS',   EUROPEAN PRINTING PUBLISHING   AND EMIGRATION OFFICE.    42 Islington, Liverpool,  October 4th 18890.    Prest W. Woodruff,   and Council.    Beloved Brethren:    I have the honor   to forward to you the monthly statement for Septem  ber and also the report of our business for the  nine months. We have taken stock closed up the   accounts and have had everything audited and   send you the statement thereof for your inspection.   There will be bills not paid from £75 to £80 pounds   which should be deducted from the Profits and   then we have carried some accounts that have been   reported year after year as assets to "Doubtful accounts"   and charged Profit and loss which will here after put   the business in better shape. I cannot but regret that   it should have been considered essential to remove   me from the Presidency of the European Mission until   the seasons business was completed and everything   closed up in a business like manner; but I presume   my labors are required somewhere else and so hav-  ing turned over everything to my fellow laborer  Apostle B. Young I waive all my personal wishes   and hasten to Mexico where D. V. I hope to have the un-  speakable happiness to report myself to you face to face   I send these statements and reports per Elder Walter Hoge   who, having labored some time in the office, will be 
 able to give you any information you may   wish concerning the accounts, emigration, or   missionary labors of the European Mission.    I am thankful to our heavenly   Father beyond expression for the experience of the   last six years; two of which was spent in Mexico   and nearly four in the European Mission. I hope   He will accept of my labors and pardon all my   short comings and in anything where I have err-  ed or failed. What little good that may have   been done to Him be the honor & glory. I am well   paid in the honor to be His servant. May prosperity   attend the European Mission and may the seed   sown bring forth much fruit to the honor and   glory of the Father and the salvation of many   souls.

 LATTER-DAY SAINTS',  EUROPEAN PRINTING PUBLISHING  AND EMIGRATION OFFICE.    42 Islington, Liverpool,  June 18th 1890    Pres. Wilford Woodruff    Dear Bro.    I trust you will  not consider it presumptous in me to address you  on a subject which I believe to be necessary and  a duty.    During the time I have been laboring here in the  Liverpool Office I have observed with anxiety the  failing health of our much beloved President, George  Teasdale, and have carefully and prayerfully arrived  at the conclusion that to withhold the facts in the case  longer from you would be dereliction of duty on my  part as a servant of God.    Pres. Teasdale had a very severe attack of sickness  in February and I do not think that he has fully  recovered from the effects of it, and with the care  and responsibility incident to his position as President  of the European Mission, his health seems to be gradually  but surely getting worse.    Of late his affairs at home seem to give him a  good deal of anxiety. He feels the loss of Bro. Picton  very much, and I understnad that since Bro. Picton's  death, Pres. Teasdale's affairs at home are not in a  satisfactory condition. The strain upon his mind, under  his present bodily condition, seems to be too great and 
 I fear the consequences should he have to continue a  great while longer without a change or the rest which  he so much needs. I have not arrived at this conclusion  merely from my own observations, but the same opinion  prevails with all the brethren whom I have conversed with  on the subject and also Sister Teasdale. Dr. Phillips,  who has been prescribing for and attending to Pres. Teasdale  during his sickness, has kindly, at my request, written  his opinion in regard to Pres. Teasdale's condition, and  I enclose it with this communication.    I have carefully avoided letting Bro. Teasdale know about  this letter for fear he might object to it's being sent, and  thus withhold the facts in the case from you, that I consider  you should be made acquainted with, preferring, like  a true and faithful servant of God, anything rather  than shrink from his duty.    Hoping you will kindly forgive me for addressing  you in this manner, which nothing but a sense of  duty would have prompted me to, and ever praying  for the blessings of our Heavenly Father to rest upon  you and all the faithful I remain    Your humble brother in the cause of Christ  Walter Hoge    [sideways text] Walter Hoge  14 June, 1890  Recd July 1 [end of sideways text] 
 LATTER-DAY SAINTS',  EUROPEAN PRINTING PUBLISHING  AND EMIGRATION OFFICE.    42 Islington, Liverpool,  Oct. 15th 1890    Prest Wilford Woodruff  Dr Br:    We are busy closing up  emigration a/e for this year. Tho' we were all inex-  perienced who were left in this office, business  went smoothly on.    Requested you to meet all the Railway  fares from your office, for I found that  many drafts had been sent to Cover expence of  emigrants and we received but little money  from them. This last payment to Guion & Co has  reduced our finances a little lower than I think  they ought to be considering the responsibility this  office is under. However you can see from mon-  thly statements our true Condition    We are making friends and enemies, but there  is not half enough elders in the field; please send  us a few score, Plenty room ^for^ good efficient men.    See Bro. Fieldsted concerning efficiency of scan-  dinavian elders; his views suit our condition well.    If my son Albert would round up his shoulders he  ought to ^be^ called on a mission. My son BS could be very useful  to me and we need some one to begin to pick up a knowledge  of the clerical business of this office in view of Bro. Alstons  release next year, his health is very poor and we cannot

This country does not agree with him, but he is  uncomplaining and strickly business, and has proved  himself an active elder in the field. We releive him  of the presidency of the L.pool Conference, calling him  to labor in this office.    Some of the elders and many of the saints are  much exercised over your manifesto, but more, I  think, in giving a sort of credence to the lying reports  which are flooding the country concerning what was done  at your late conference. My testimony is, that all your  acts are in perfect harmony with the revelations of  God and I have talked and written, I believe, effectually  on this subject. Astonishing how the world mourns over  what they they are pleased to call a surrendering of principles  on our part.    Love to Prests.

T. moved out on  the 4th of Oct I was actually five weeks getting into  42. I cannot let this amount appear against me.  I have enumerated most of the expense of sleep-  ing and eating, but not all. Now if you choose to meet  this extra expense by approprating and sending a draft  all right; otherwise I will forward an order on Rossiter to  pay you there—which can be credited to this office—one  hundred and fifty dollars. The table expenses, generally,  would have meet this amount, during Bro. T's time, and I  really think he should have had the extra expense to meet  not I. But do what you think is right bethren and  shall be satisfied. I await your answer to all my  Communications. God bless you forever    Your Brother in Christ  Brigham Young.    over 
 LATTER-DAY SAINTS',  EUROPEAN PRINTING PUBLISHING  AND EMIGRATION OFFICE.    42. Islington, Liverpool,  Sept. 23rd 1890    Prest Woodruff  S. L. C. Utah  Dear Brother:    My visits to London and  Lowestoft and attendance at the Conferences have been pleasant  and the Lord is merciful unto us in this Country. At our  London Conference it ^is^ said that Jarman mustered his forces just  below our hall but did not interefere with our comfort.    The conference at Lowestoft was unusually well attended I  am informed, and there were about forty people present. One gentle-  man who is investigating the principles of the Gospel came to me  after the evening meeting and thanked me for the information  he had gained. Our affairs are at a low ebb, no persecution, but  an indifference, hard to cope with, seems to have settled upon  the people. Lies are flying about and the most insideous come  from our own mountain home. Apostates write that, the Govt. has   stopped polygamy but the elders are living openly with young girls  marriage or no marriage. I am forcebly impressed with the idea  that if an effort were made among the people, instructions sent to the  presidents of stakes and ^were to^ they operate with the Bishops Teachers etc  energetically, to have the people write to their friends throughout the  British mission that good would be accomplished. The people are indiffer-  ent in this land but they have an excellent example set them by their  friends in Zion. I am satisfied that, quite a commotion would be made  among those who have known us long if they could have faithful  testimonies from their absent friends. The Lord knows we need help from  every good scource. 
 LATTER-DAY SAINTS',  EUROPEAN PRINTING PUBLISHING  AND EMIGRATION OFFICE.    42. Islington, Liverpool,   189    Don't think me presumptious, brethren, in offering this suggestion, but  ^I^ have felt, quite strongly that it was the begening of the finish of this mission,  of course I am anxious to have it last but I dont ^beleive^ God will endure perfect  indifference ^on the part of the people^ for any great length of time. It seems to me there are thous-  ands of people here who must receive the Gospel, good honest souls blinded  by the craftiness of men, and my mind is already full of anxiety to know  how to teach them. God help His elders, no human power can break  the spell which evil has wrought upon the minds of the people.    The greater part of the experienced elders of the mission will  soon be released to return home. I feel that we must pray and  work harder—more hours—to fill the vacancy which will be  felt throughout the entire mission.    It will be pretty hard upon the president of the mission ^to do^ but it  seems actually necessary that he should attend every conference. So  much needed instructions to the elders. They drop into curious nooks  and corners and run in others ruts without giving the subject thought or due  Consederation; and the presthood meetings at these times as the most im-  portant of all.    My family is well.

 Jesse O. Ballenger  24 Dec 1877  Questions regarding eating  at one Table    Sunset Arizona Dec. 24th 1877    Pres. John Taylor  and the Twelve.    Dear Breathren  I feel it will not be amiss to  write a few lines to inform  you of our present good health  and prospects; Knowing the intres  you have in this mission. We are  at our camp at this time about  two hundred souls. All enjoying  good health and a plenty of work  We work all together as one family  and live as near a like as we  can. We are building a dining  room and are calculating to  all eat at the same table  like they do at Orderville. But  the rumer has come here that  the Twelve council otherwise  and the brethren do not feel  so well united about eating  together as they did before and 
 a few words of council from  you to us on the subject would  be thankfuly received no matter  wheather it was to all eat at the   one table or to continue to eat  at our own tables as we are  I believe your council would be  unanimusly caried out.    Bro. Lot Smith has about  the same number at his  camp that we have. They   eat at the big table and  work to gether to same as we  do. Bro. Allen has not quite  so many at his camp as  is at either of the other camps  Bro. Lake as joined my  camp. They left their place  on account of sickness. But  are all well at present.  We have just started our new  thrasher to day and it is doing  very well. Bro. Foster from  Ogden    thinks he never saw wheat  turn out so well. We have  about forty acres of fall wheat  in at this settlement it looks   well. This is I think a very  fine climate, we have had  no snow and but little frost  it freezes some of nights But  is nice and warm through  the days. With kind regards  I wish to remain as ever    Your Brother in the Gospel  Jesse O Ballenger 
 Nov 1 [18]90  B. Young  Liverpool  Rcd Nov 20 [18]90  In re Missionary    The First Presidency  Dear Brethren:    I have sent   a copy of this document to the presi-  dents of the Conferences, for quite   a number of them have told me   that there were plenty of ^Young^ men in   their neighborhood ^at home^ who were just   the men for a mission. Brethren   you can see that my intention is good   and I hope this will meet your   minds. I will forward the list I  make up from the reports, to you soon  as possible. True we need men who will   strike out into new fields, we ^have^ a very few in   the mission who are determined to plow   in old fields, and there are no saints to   saupport that class. In some conferences I find   that retaining drunken people in the church   has, in one instance driven out a fairly good   man and is baring respectable people who are   favorably impressed with ^ the^ doctrines. When all means   are exhausted and they persist in their drunkeness   I have advised their being cut off. I find respecta-  ble people in every Conference who are enquiring   into the gospel. Just sunday in stockton on Tees strangers   came in the evening ^to our meeting^ and one young man ^was heard to^ remarked as  he went out the door at the close, "I could sit and listen   all night to such talk as that,"—the first principles of the   Gospel.

 42, Islington, Liverpool, Nov. 1, 1890.  Prest. Elder W. Woodruff    Dear Brother,    There is pressing need for Elders in the   missionary fields in these lands, and believing that you are acquainted   with young men in the wards where you reside, who are financially   and otherwise competent to fill good missions, we desire you to send   such names to us as you honestly suggest, so that we can present   them to the Presidency and Missionary Committee in Zion for their   consideration.    Trusting that what you do will be quietly and properly done,  so as not create feeling when names are not acted upon, and   awaiting a prompt reply,    I remain your brother in Christ,    BRIGHAM YOUNG.

Oct. 29th 1890.    Prest. W. Woodruff  Salt Lake City, Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Salt Lake City Utah   Dear Brother:    Arrived home   last night twelve oclock. It is cold and snowy   in Scotland. Had an excellent Conference, Hall was   crowded most of them strangers. Sub. Ed. "Glasgow Eve-  news," present. He walked home with me after evening   meeting. I received a note from him—Mr. Jas. Alex. Kilpat-  rick—^this morning^ apologising for his "anti Mormon humour," "I mean no   offense." He proffers to publish any corrections I wish to   make in his report of our Conversation.    I found the brethren in scotland anxiously looking   to L.pool for more elders. The eight ^elders^ that came were not   half enough for scotland alone, and I could spare   them not one. They want thirty to fifty efficient elders.   Openings are being made that must be improved, and   we see them languish for the want of help. Most of   the Conferences I have attended need assistance, elders   who can help themselves and their families not feel   distressed. Many of the brethren have said to me, there   are plenty of Young ^men at home^ in our neighbourhood, who ought to   Come out into the world on missions, and some have   stated that, these efficient Young men were kept at   home by the ward authorities. I am aware that many 
 remained at home to vote, but the enemy is fast re-  leasing them and perhaps we can soon turn all of ^our^   attention to preaching the gospel. I have asked the   brethren for lists of names and will send them to you;  do not think me too officious in this act, the anxiety   in me may plead for me.    Good tourists have done a wonderful amount of   good, and this class hunt up relatives and introduce   the elders into places and families, not reached heretofore.    Circumstances make it necessary to release Bro Jenk-  ins from the scotish mission. Bro Brough is also released,   this leaves but nine elders there. It seems to me that   all the elders are going one way. Have some one advise   me of elders being called and when they will leave. A few   lines will post me.    Where it is possible I have not suffered lies in the   news papers to go unchalenged. Bro Carlisle and I   are now acquainted with parties' connected with the   leading papers here and ^also with^ Mr. Shearman American Con-  sul and proffered ^to them^ information concerning our affairs   that they need go astray no more. I am sending the star  to these men and places, and have proffered to give them   books if they will read them. Public libraries ought   to be supplied, especially reading rooms so far as we   can consistently, but I leave this to your direction.    We are well and have the old place clean and   comparatively cheerful looking. God bless you. Love to   Prest Geo Q. C. & Jos. F S. and the brethren, ^In^ w^h^ich all join.

Mr. Gibson said, we are sorry that Bro^Mr.^ Jack   did not speak about your affair, but the board could   do nothing only what had been requested but would have   granted free passage for yourself and family had it been re-  quested ^by^ Mr Jack    I have had the steps repared and some other   need repairs, if the account is not satisfactory I ask   Bro Cannon to draw the money from estate and pay   it and charge it to me.

 42 Islington L.pool Eng.  Nov. 8th 1890    President Wilford Woodruff  Salt Lake City Utah  Dear Brother.    Your favor of Oct. 20th  came to hand in due course of mail, I am rejoiced  to receive this communication from you, it breathes  a spirit that finds a congenial echo in my heart  and stimulates me to emulate your example in these  great and important labors.    I was glad to learn that, Bro. Teasdale accom-  plished his journey to Deming so comfortably, and  of his improved physical condition, as instanced by  his letter to me from that point.  It is I say, very satisfactory  for he looked badly—emaciated and sorrowful when I  saw him last.  It almost gave one the blues to look in-  to his sallow countenance, and not until he smiled &  talked cheerfully could one eradicate, from his mind,  the idea that, he was a much "enduring man."  God go  with him in his new field of labors.  His kind heart and  faithful labors have endeared him to the saints and they  speak of him here as they spoke of him during my late  visit to Mexico.    I am thankful for the prospects of more elders  coming to our assistance.  God give them courage to  push out successfully into new fields, for they shall 
 have that blessed opportunity.    Bro. Metz is an old friend of mine and I deem him  a good man; a little impatient perhaps, sometimes, which we  may, in charity, call firmness and zeal.  I gladly extend the  hand of a brother to the elders especially to Bro. Metz and  hope to see them all in the near future.    It will be a pleasure to release Bro. F. A. Brown to re-  turn home and I believe Bro. Metz quite equal to the oc-  casion.  Tho^se^ who study the Dutch language find it  difficult to acquire and young men who are appointed  to this mission accomplish but little in the field within  two years.  I have written to Bro. Brown to give me  his views respecting the prospects of the Holland mission,  which report I write furni^s^h to you in due time.    Prests. Cannon & Smith are perfectly familiar with the  difficulties elders need in the Holland mission,  I am of  the opinion that we need laborers there now, however I  am willing to let the Lord dictate in this as in all other  matters.    I will look anxiously for elders who are suitable to  go to Turkey, but I can say to you now that, we need  all the help we now have, and if you have in your  mind good efficient men who are natural linguist, 
 I believe they ought to be called and sent to the Turkish  mission    We have been discussing the propriety of putting our  Milleniael star before the public as other papers are  advertized. I can see no impropiity in doing it if  we incur no additional expense.    Bro. Teasdale informs me that you appropriated  a sum of money to assist in furnishing tracks to the  elders; they are quite liberal with their own means in this  good work.  You know our condition financially, that is,  without your assistance track distributing ^by the elders^ will cease or  be very much curtailed, and I am not clear but what the  latter maybe the proper thing ^for^ theym to do:    Within the last month two of our brethern have been banished  from the Kingdom of Bavaria.  I am quite sure this would not  have happened if the principles of the gospel had been understood   by those in authority, even in Bavaria. Our elders would find a great  advantage if we were better known, in presenting the gospel ^to strangers^.  We have  friends through whom we might reach some of these parties if we cared  to take that trouble.  I would much prefer to be represented by my friends  then ^by^ my ^by^ enemies.    Bro Carlisle and I have made the acquaintence of  many ofthe newspaper men in this city and we feel  some confidence that they will treat us with some degree  of fairness.  Mr Ranesden has introduced us and he  has made a personal request that we be treated as gentlemen should be. 
 If Prest. Geo. Q. Cannon could make us a visit &  introduce some of the elders to parties that he can approach,  and I think John W. is favorably known to many in this  country, and with all the power we can muster we can reach  men that overtoss those scrubs who maltreat our elders;  99 times in a hundred simply because they think our brethren  have no friends.  I would like to show them to the contrary.  The power is in men to do much of themselves and I am  sure the Lord has given us a few good friends in this Country  I beleive it to be our duty to use every means in our power  to conteract the abominable lies which ^are^ spued out of  United States and find their way onto this island.    Our policy is to get acquainted, offer to ans-  wer respectable questions and give our reasons for the  hope we have.  We have had many interesting conversations  with strangers.  I hear good reports from many parts  of the mission.  Where it is practicable we try to crawl out of  the back alleys and slums ^in our Conferences^ and hire halls in more respecta-  ble quarters.  Where it can be done it pays in increase of congrega-  tion.    Brethren join me in love to you and the brethren as  also my family wish to be kindly remembered to you  all    Your Brother in Christ  Brigham Young

The cost of the books  are, Dictionaries 13/6 ^each^ Bibles 1/9 each  which would make a total of £9.3.0.    The publishers say they only have a  few copies of the Dictionary on hand,  and then it will be "O. P."    I rather think it is not much   called for and they wish to dispose  of a portion of their dead stock.    I did not feel free to purchase  the books for Bro. Lee and forward the  bill as he directs, or render any assistance  from this office, without first consult- 
 ^ing^ with you, and learning your mind  in the matter.    Please advise me what you think  best to do in the matter.    Please return Bro. Lee's letter with  your answer.

 B Young  42 Ishington Lpool  Dec 23rd 1890  Recd Jan 24 1891    Prests Woodruff,  Cannon  Smith    Dr Brethren:    Enclose a  letter received from Bro. Fred Stauffer.  It is impossible for me to write the way  I feel about this matter to Bro. Stauffer  because I have not the authority to open  up that mission as I think now it ought  to be done. However, the matter once before  you my mind will be at ease in this  matter as in all others wsheretofore. I fone  of the First Presidency or Lorenzo Snow or  any one of the Twelve or anyone else whom  you chosose could visit that country and  formally open the mission and arrange  for the translation and publication of  our works as suggested by Bro. S. I am  of the opinion that good could be  done there. And I am favorably impress  ed with the idea of placing ourselves  on an equal footing before the law  with other Christian denomination; and 
 to avoid complication that it should be done  soon as convenient, I have thought strongly  of having something of the kind here in this  country. It is understood that Christian  ministers are licensed and we are more liable  to pursecution without license. I shall investi-  gate the matter a little more carefully them  I have been able to do and if the spirit  consents and you do not object obtain  license for some one or more of the brethren.    You will pardon my writing so often  but this time I am much exercised in spirit  in relation to our missionary in Turkey.    We are suffering from colds. The weather  is all we don't want, but ^we^ remain comparatively  happy.    The brethren join in love. Bro L. Pratt is  here ^arriving last night^ the death and sickness in his family  have discomposed him to that extent ^and^ he could not  work in Paris. He has come to talk with me.  I don't  know what his plans are but he feels badly.  Will com-  fort ^him^ all I can.  Perhaps he wants to go home. My mind  if ^is^ for him to continue his labors unless his presence is  necessary at home.    Praying God to be with ^you^ in your journey and  on all occasions  I am Your Brother in Christ  Mrs. Y send regards.    Brigham Young 
 LATTER-DAY SAINTS',  EUROPEAN PRINTING PUBLISHING  AND EMIGRATION OFFICE.    42, Islington, Liverpool,  Jany 23rd 1892    President Wilford Woodruff    Dear Brother    Your favor of  Dec 28th with instructions in regard to sending  you a statement of the balances of money in bank  &c, on the first of each month, received, and  will be attended to.   I received the  enclosed letter from Elder Joseph F Schoeufield  President of the Turkish Mission, whom I am  informed was not feeling well in health on his  arrival at Constantinople last fall, and as  he says his lungs are affected and desires  to be released from the Turkish Mission and  sent to Switzerland where some of his relatives  reside. I thought it would not be wise  to delay his release, and therefore sent him  word that he has been transferred to the Swiss  & German Mission as desired, although I do not at  present know of a man to take his place,  We have none in England, and I have written  J J Scharrer President of the Swiss & German  Mission asking him if he has an experienced Elder  whom he can recommend, but should he not have  a suitable one, perhaps you will suggest  what shall be done. Elder Herman is the only

I also received the enclosed  letter from E H Anderson from which you will  see he reports the financial condition of the  Scandinavian Mission, not good, and suggests  that as an encouragement to them to get out  of debt and to assist them in the publishing  department that the church pay the fares  of returning Missionaries for 1892, at the present  time the Church pays their fares from New  York home, so I presume what he desires  is that the Church pay their fares from  Scandinavia to New York, the custom of  this office being to charge the Scandaniavian  office with them trusting to receive an  answer soon I remain    Yours truly  Brigham Young

 B. Young    LATTER-DAY SAINTS',  EUROPEAN PRINTING PUBLISHING  AND EMIGRATION OFFICE.    42 Islington, Liverpool,    Nov. 26th 1890    Prest. Wilford Woodruff,  Salt Lake City, Utah.    Dear Brother:    Enclose  letter from Bro. Stauffer. It speaks  for its self; and more, it speaks  my mind in relation to the Turk-  ish mission. It seems to me that  a good work can be done there  and if that mission were properly  organized, destricted and made  more familiar to our minds, I have  no reason to doubt there could  be great good accomplished.    The colonization scheme was talk-  ed of in fathers day and is worthy  of consideration in my opinion. 
 But of course I leave all   those matters for your consider-  ation. If I am correctly inform-  ed Jan & Feb., earlier or a little  later, ^either^ would be a good time to  visit the Holy land. I put  out these ideas as they occur  to me.    I go to Ireland on Friday  night to attend conference. Ex-  pect to return monday. We  look for the first company of  Elders to arrive on sat. or sun.    We are in very good health  and business going on as usual.    God bless and preserve you  and overrule the acts of those  wolves.    Your Brother in Christ    Brigham Young 
 Prd Woodruff expressed himself honor'd in the privilege of  speaking in this meeting. Referred to the subject of brethren  wanting to be ordained to higher priesthood &c. Agreed with  Bishop Hunter. Spoke of the early part of the church; for three  years he acted as Teacher and preached, and built up branches. 
 Bro Woodruff said I have been edified this evening, and  am interested in the building up of this Kingdom.    Upon this quorum (the Bishops) rests great responsibility.  I would like to know why this people go to our enemies  to make their purchases, and those who hold the priesthood  may sink, and all this, right under the eyes of the first Presi-  dency: Another is, why so many pretending to be saints,  make promi[s]es, without caring whether they fulfil them  or not, and why they run in debt, regardless of ever paying.  I see such men in Israel, and am ashamed of it; I  despise such folly. Why in the name of almighty God,  do not this people shake themselves free of these sins.    I call upon you Bishops to help relieve Prest Young of  some of these duties, and not let him be borne down  with these things. Use your influence to restrain the  flood of wheat and Flour from going to these Gentile stores --  we shall have a famine if it is not stopped. I keep a debtor  and Creditor account with the Lord in my tithing, of all  that I produce, or consume as I would with a Gentile  Store, or any other; when can a man pay his tithing so  well, as at the time of raising, or harvesting.    If every man kept a book account of his tithing and expenses  the Bishops would find it an easy matter to settle the  Tithing with them. Prune your quorums, it is better to  prune them than that the Tree should rot. If israel do  not do their duty, we shall lose the Presidency. May the  spirit and power of the priesthood rest upon the Bishops,  for upon them rests great responsibility. May God  bless you with every blessing you need &c 
 Wilford Woodruff / said that what he had heard to night  was good, for we as a people have got to reform, especially  with regard to our commercial matters, was glad to  see such a willingness manifested towards relieving  the Presidency of some of their burthens; he reminded the  Bishops, that many were in the habit of taking their Grain  to the Gentiles and trade it off he hoped they would put a  check to it as far as they could; he would rejoice to see  the day when all Bishops, Missionaries, Presidents, and  others will be so far living their religion, and walking up to  their duties, that the President could come into their meet  ings and rejoice in their midst. Spoke of the n^e^cessity of  each one who holds the priesthood acting in their calling,  and not to wait for President Young to put his hand upon  everything that needs correction, he felt to say to Bishop Hunter,  his Counsellors, and the Bishops generally May God bless  and speed you, he then spoke of the reformation as being  a straightforward and natural thing, there was no mystery  about it, but consisted in leaving off every evil practise, and  doing better, let us honour every man in his calling, and  wherever any man in authority can exercise the spirit of  mercy it is good, though it is neccessary to use the rod  at times. May God bless you all Amen.    The following "Ordinations" were attended to 
 Wilford Woodruff, desired the Bishops and other authorities  to lay their hands upon the brain as far as they can, and  pay especial regard to the remarks of Elder Orson Hyde,  he then appealed to the Missionaries who had partly waked  and desired them to get more of the fire of the Holy Ghost; speaking  of the lessor priesthood, he said show me a man who had magnified  and honored his calling as a Teacher, and I will show you a mighty  man in Israel, there had been such a rush into the quorums of  the Seventy's and High Priests, that they had become as black as  midnight; he rebuked the practise of taking every little  difficulty to the President instead of having them settled by the  Priests Teachers &c and he with the rest of the Twelve intended  to be after every Quorum, until the fire of God should burn so hot,  as to consume all the iniquity that lurks in our midst. 
 Wilford Woodruff was pleased with L. W. Hardy's introducing the  Book of Mormon &c into the schools, spoke of his own indefaticable   exertions about a year ago, to wake up an interest among the  children in every ward by holding evening meetings with them  but owing to the deadness of the parents it was an uphill work  and almost labour in vain, speaking of the priesthood he said  Bp Hunter was the head of this Bishopric, and he often felt  weighed down with something on his mind which he wanted  the Bishops to relieve him of, by carrying out his instructions, refered   to the Israelites who had gone so far from God, that they could do  nothing without a Law, even to govern them in the smallest things,  such was the condition of the world at the present time, spoke of  the extent of the priesthood that the Bishops exercised among  the people, which was sufficient for almost everything that trans-  pired, if the people will do right.    He deprecated the practise of farmers bringing young sheep to the  Butchers for slaughter, and desired the Bishops to check it, for  the raising of Wool, Hemp, and Flax was of too much importance  to be trifled with, for we may rest assured, that we shall be under  the necessity of sustaining ourselves, and that very soon.  contrasted the law of the priesthood with the laws of the Territory, by  one of which everybody had to be governed. 
 Wilford Woodruff, suggested as a preventive against the  brethren getting behind hand in their tithing, viz for every  one to pay it at the very time of raising, and in every kind  that is raised, he also suggested that Bro McRae be appointed  a Bishop of the 11th Ward, with the view of relieving the excess-  ive burthen now upon the shoulders of Bro Hardy. 
 Wilford Woodruff backed up the sentiments just advanced, he felt  that it was the duty of the Bishops to attend to their temporal duties,  which was the leading ideas of Bp Hunter, the responsibilities  resting of the Bishops are great, especially as so many of the  brethren are now taking more wives, they will require at your  hands much council on the principle of obedience, for unless  children are taught to be obedient to their parents, they will be  come poor Husbands and wives. It was the duty of the  Twelve that are at home to follow the example of Prest B Young  to walk into the different quorums to give instruction, and see  how things are going on, for it was not only their right, but God  required it at their hands; he wished the Bishops would hold  on to the members of the quorums of Priests, Teachers and Deacons  that are good for anything, and not allow them to go off into  the seventys until they have magnified their calling in the lessor  priesthood, but he deprecated a contentious spirit between  the different quorums, as to which was the greatest, this had been  a bone of contention since the beginning, and ought to be put a  stop to, after giving some valuable instruction on this subject, he  prayed that God would bless us all. 
 Wilford Woodruff, stated there was a vacancy in the history of the  church, for at least 3 months immediately after the death of Joseph,  and if any present can furnish anything either from memory or Journal  that transpired during that period, will please forward the same to the  Historians Office, referring to the reformation, he said the Lord had forgiven  us for what was past, but after rebaptism, should the people again sin in  Israel, the Law would undoubtedly be put in force, for it was impossible  that people could henceforth sin with impunity, for he well knew that Prest  Young would never appear before us again in that merciful consideration,  which he has done of late, refered to the great blessings that belonged to  the lessor priesthood, especially the ministration of angels, and strongly  deprecated a spirit of contention that had been more or less manifest  for the last 14 years, and recommended each one to realize the respon  sibility that rested on them, let their calling be what it may, mentioned  the power of the priesthood that was manifest in several instances  in Nauvou, where the sick and dying lay about in all directions, and  Joseph rose up and shook himself, and commanded every one of them  to rise up, and they were healed forthwith, he also spoke of other instances  where the wicked were Kept at Bay, and were made to Quake and fear  at the words of the Lord through his Servants Joseph, Brigham, and David  Patten, spoke of the clouds that were gathering ahead of us, and the necessity  of each one being in readiness both Temporally and Spiritually, that we may  have the blessing and approbation of God. 
 W. Woodruff, felt interested, he had seen a reformation in every  meeting he now attended, there was a different spirit and  atmosphere altogether, to what there was last year, spoke of  the principle of submission to the priesthood, that existed here  in this King dom, which could not be found among any  people on the face of the earth, he refered to the example that  the Saviour set us in this thing, by patiently enduring the most  abject poverty and deprivation of every kind, surrounded by bitter  persecution &c all in obedience to the priesthood, there was not one  out of a thousand in this Territory that would refuse to obey the  council of President Young, and while we as a people continue  to take this course, we shall be surrounded with blessing all  the time, the world knows nothing of this principle, but rather  indulge in a disposition to devour each other, he then spoke of  the importance of the twelve having the same spirit as was in President  Young, and as He could not be personally present in the various  quorums, wherever the twelve went, they should be able to do just  as He would, were he present, after giving much instruction and  encouragement, he prayed that God would bless them.    D. Fulmer, was delighted to contemplate the change that had been  brought about among the saints, especially in the absence of all  difficulties, for he had not heard of one either with the Bishops  or any one else for a long time, whereas some time ago, not  only the Bishops, but the High Council and the Presidency had  piles of them. 
 Wilford Woodruff, believed the saints would have just as much to do  in this world, and in that which is to come, as ever we are capable  of performing, and so far from supposing we had come here to rest,  his past experience had thoroughly converted him from that doctrine,  he spoke of the importance of every Elder in Israel keeping a Journal  or History of things as the transpire, at the first organization of the  Twelve apostles, "The Prophet Joseph said he had suffered much sorrow  of heart, for not writing or caused to be written the dealings of God with  this people, he said also, whenever you Quorums meet, be sure you always  have a clerk to record all your decisions, if you don't, the Lord will be angry  with you" Bro. Woodruff remarked that he had himself kept a Journal  for the last 24 years, and daily recorded his doings and whereabouts,  and much of what he had heard from the Prophet Joseph and the  Twelve, he then strongly urged on the Bishops to keep an account of  how they spend their time, which would form an important History in  Generations to come &c 
 Bro W. Woodruff, hoped the people would  take care of what sheep we now have, there had been  such neglect heretofore, and consequently great loss and  destruction which had made his heart sick he hoped the  Brethren would take more care of them, on Tithing he  said he had been in the Storehouse and seen the immen[se]  quantity of Grain, and if a few more Teams came in [,] the  bins would run over. 
 Elder Woodruff spoke of the importance of  Bishops watching especially at the present time as there  were many gathering between the Mountains to go East.  there had been a span of Horses taken away last night  at the West Mountain, the Lariats had been cut and the  Animals were missing, he exhorted the Bishops to watch  and for them to set others to watch also, and as far as   possible dont allow any one to go away in debt either to  the Emigrating Fund or any one else for it was nothing  but right that people should pay their debts before they  are allowed to go away. 
 Elder Wilford sustained the remarks and   sentiments of Prest Young, and was glad that the time had  come, when the Elders on missions would be sustained   with funds by the people here instead of the poor saints abroad.

 Wilford Woodruff, being present, remarked, that as the time for holding  our Annual Fair was at hand, he wished the Bps of the several wards  to appoint persons to deliver public addresses in each ward, on the subject  of holding the Fair, and encourage the people to bring specimens of their  workmanship in cloth, and other products of their skill and industry. 
 Elder Wilford Wilford, entirely coincided with the previous remarks—   we have men in our midst who would sell the Kingdom, their Houses, Farms,  anything else that will strengthen the hands of our enemies, let us therefore  one and all walk up to our duties, that are now required of us, and back  up our Bishops, the Mayor &c 
 Elder W. Woodruff said many of our children were being sent to  outside schools, who deny new revelation, and many other principles  of the Gospel, he opposed it in his feelings, and would not do it himself.  We ought to sustain our own Teachers who are in full faith and fellowship with us.  There are many dead branches which must sooner or later be cut off, for they neither go  to meeting nor pray, but can swear, get drunk &c.    The Lessor Priesthood should be organized in every ward to act in their lot and place,  no man should feel himself so high as to refuse to act in that priesthood.    He then spoke of the respect that Joseph Smith the Prophet entertained towards the Teachers  and submitted to a severe criticism by the first Teacher that ever entered his house.    The Bishops held very responsible positions, and he felt to encourage them to be faithful  for God required it at their hands.    If we only become united as a people before God, no power can ever harm the anointed of  God. We have no time to waste, but let us be up and do our duty, act as Patriarchs  over our own house, for it was painful to see our young people growing up in Infidelity,  and give themselves up to all kinds of wickedness.    We had more faith in the prayers of ten righteous men, than in all the big guns  on the face of the earth, Prest Young and George Q Cannon were instances of  deliverance, as the result of faith and prayer. 
 Elder W. Woodruff was pleased with the representation of the Bishops to night, the blessing   of the Lord will rest upon the Missionaries who go in the right spirit.    He suggested that a Surgeon and Midwife should go along, and that all the company   operate in one common interest, carrying out the principle of the united order; and   work for each other. 
 Randolph Rich Co May 31, 1874    Dear Brother Brigham    I write to say that   we have organized Evry Branch in this   Stake of Zion in the United Order except one,   had a good time, much of the Spirit of the Lord   with us. Most of the people receive it.    My object in writing at this time is to say   to you that Brothers Rich, Budge, & myself   visited Soda Spring Branch, & preached to what   people there was there of the Saints but did   not organize Because the president & most   of the leading men of that Branch of the Church   were gone from home, butht most of those who   were present voted to join the order, and   on[e] that is in your jurisdiction I thought   perhaps you could visit them and organize   them by sending an appointment so they could be   at home. We have held 23 Meeting and organize   11 Branches of the United Order.

Dear Brethern:    I am thankful for the privilege of  writing to you on this auspicious day. Deeply grateful am I for the tidings of what will transfire  in our loved mountain home on this the sixty second anniversary of the establishing of the church  of Christ in the earth. God is merciful to His people, we live to behold a day that I did not  whope would transpire within the limited span allotted time on earth.    Brethren of the Presidency and Twelve, I join you in spirit this day during  your celebratiansand offerings unto God. When a boy, I rejoiced during the services of  laying the capstone on the Temple at Nauvoo; as a man, I worship the Being who has  brought about this great triumph to the saints; here is demonstrated their skill perseverance  and industry, a blended monument of the zeal and integority of the people, a thing of beauty and  a joy forever. Your own feelings will tell you how joyfully I would join you ^on^ this oc  casion, but under the circumstances I could not hope or expect to attend these celebrations  which precede the most complete dedicatory cerimonies which I trust are not far distant    Although far distant from the stiring scenes which have transried among you  during the last ninteen months, yet I have been with you in spirit and sustained  ^you^ with my prayers before the Lord. It was not difficult for one to understand the various mover  which have been made and I approved of the "Manifesto" proclamations etc which have ^been^  insued by the Presidency and Twelve, unto the saints. In all these mutatitions but once  have I felt the solid ground move under my feet, and that was long ago when the elders  maintained that the "manifesto" not only abrogated all plural marriages but ^also^ ad-  vised the brethren to break up their plural families and discard, seperate from, ignore  those women who were wives anterior to the ^passage of those^ vile ^ants^ polygamy laws, as well as later marriages. 
 I have laid these matters away, and concluded it will be time enough across that  bridge when I reach it. The business which devolves upon me with furnish awhile  employment while I am in this land and I trust in God for all future exigencies.  Perhaps more will be known in relation to the sitriahan after the anvesty is pro-  I caimed, than is dreamed of now. One thing, in relations to my present feelings,  is quite clear. I would rather live without all my wives, entirely seper-  ate from them, than to live exclusively with any one of my wives. While I  hold these feelings yet they are now and with Gods help my whole being  shall be subject to "thus saith the Lord".    I am but poorly in health, and in fact all of the brethren  in the office are loosing their energy, but we are still able to keep things  moving and I am improving so are the brethren I believe. Summer is coming  and we all feel a sensation of returning health. I am quite sure the climate  here is changing for the worse and occasionally Englishmen express themselves  as being & disgusted with the climate.    We left New Brighton and now occupy a house near Princes Park  at a rent of two hundred dollars per year. Have used some money to purchase  necessary articles for keeping house. There were a few things at 42 we could use but  most everything there would not bear transportion, too old and broken. Will ^soon^ send  the amount used and if you do not choose to allow it I will pay it.    Of course I do not know how you are pleased with our administration  but I am well pleased with the way we are getting on.    Please send us a good writer for sub-editor and a first class printer. We  are dependant on Union people, — Mr. Davis having left us — and these are hard  men who calculate to get pay without much work. Bro. Anderson ought to  be released as early as September ^if not before^ and the man who suceeds him ought to have  experience in the field before he comes into the office.    God bless you my dear brethren with love in which the  brethren and Mrs. Y. join    Your Bro in Christ    Brigham Young 
 LATTER-DAY SAINTS',  EUROPEAN PRINTING PUBLISHING  AND EMIGRATION OFFICE.    42, Islington, Liverpool.  May 6th 1892    Presidents W Woodruff  G Q Cannon  Jos F Smith    Dear Brethren:  The proposition to  detain Bro. Osmond to repace Bro. Anderson is impracticable for  the following reasons. Bro. Osmond was here on mission two years  from 1884 to 1886. He came here year last Jan. it will be two years  next Jan. His health is much impared, His financial condition  at home is embarassing, and under these circumstances I have  arranged to release him in the near future. I presume you will  look upon his case as I do. He is willing to stay, but another winter here  would prove fatal to him ^I believe^; within the last three months he has been at deaths  door; he now presides in London.    I have spent some forty pounds for house furniture the bills for  most of it I forward you have no bills for the ten pounds Furniture etc  at 42 would not bear transportation the brethren use that which we left that  which is good for anything. I will pay these bills should ^you^ intimate it is  my business to do so. Have taken my family notraveling to improve the health  of my wife and children who have been seriously afflicted at times, hence  the great expense to me. Bro. Anderson is gradually failing in health so  are most of the brethren who sleep at 42; business makes it necessary for  them to do so. Printers earn their wages by shirking, must be watched closely.    My brethren & family join in love    Your Bro in Christ.    Brigham Young

 [sideways text] Brigham Young  March 9, [18]92 [end of sideways text]    LATTER-DAY SAINTS',   EUROPEAN PRINTING PUBLISHING  AND EMIGRATION OFFICE.    42 Islington, Liverpool.    March 9th 1892    Prest. Wilford Woodruff  Salt Lake City, Utah.    Dear Brother: Your favor Feb. 15th  came to hand and was perused with uncommon  interest and I will answer you according to the light  that is in me. First, we thank you for your kind invi-  tation to attend the aniversary of your birth day Heaven  has favored you and I thank God you are recovered  from your recent illness and for the presservation of your  life to comfort the saints and your family. I will sug-  gest that your next invatation anti date your birth  day, time enough ^for us^ to joni you, especially should you  consider our presence necessary—rather desiriable.    Curiosity I believe is the mainspring that has brought  strangers to our meetings, and I believe that, curiosity is  waning; for all over the mission with about three exceptions  the people feel in the districts where our people elders labor, that  a mormon elder, with his gospel is a nuissance. The  people do not want the gospel and while we do batptize  a few—not one proselyte to each elder in the year. Still it  is a fact that, the elders meet with but little but abuse.  We are warning the people and ^doing^ but little else. I have felt  to put a force in here—this nation, that, the people will be left  without excuse, I have found not one case where the distribution  of tracts has brought one soul to our meetings or into the Church. 
 So far as emigration matters are concerned, the english por-  tion is rather insignificant, what ^emigrants^ there are could ship at  southhampton joining german steamer at that point which  could bring our Scandinavian emigration better than  there present method of Conveyance, in my opinion. But this  is a matter that with your permission I will examine into more  particularly, not with a view of doing anything but for information  pending future events.    President Woodruff, this mission is a dead beet so far  as proselyting is concerned. My whole anxiety has been to warn  the people, outside of that, the mission is shurnken to an insig-  nificant compass. We hire halls and but few come; I am afraid  there is culpable neglect on the part of the saints, many have to  be nursed and ^for the elder^ to leave them—the saints—to break new ground many  become cold indifferent and must have a frequent application of  gospel warming pan, and I have known cases when it was impossi-  ble to resussitate them. Our batteries are too light metal, the Lord  can turn their ^the peoples^ indifference to interest, but we cannot.    Prest Saml Thurman, London, reports some interest among strangers  there but it is comparatively little; one of the elders had been laboring  for two months and thought if he could be left in that vicinity for a few weeks  longer he could make one or two converts. We have to contend with  supreme indifference of the people, or abuse. Your son-in-law is about  correct. I am not discouraged and we have many conferences to  attend within the next two months.    I could give you more detailes but these are facts as I  understand the situation.    God bless you with long life future—Love to brethren, in which  the brethren join.

 OFFICE OF  The First Presidency  of the  Church of Jesus Christ  of  Latter-day Saints.    P.O. Box B. Salt Lake City, Utah May 10, 1895.    Elder Brigham Young,  City.    Dear Brother:    The changed conditions in the Church educational system  have rendered it desirable, in the opinion of the First Presidency and the  members of the Boards of Young University and the Latter-day Saints  College, of Salt Lake City, that these two institutions of learning should  be consolidated, and to preserve the name of President Brigham Young it  is suggested that the new establishment be known as Young Institute. It  is thought the best interests of the school will be subserved by greatly  reducing the number of members of the Board (say to seven); as at present  it is next to impossible to get together a sufficient number to form a  quorum. Under these circumstances it will be necessary for the greater  portion of the members of the board of Young University to resign. We  ourselves have each of us already tendered our resignation, and we write  this to you to ask if you have any objections to resigning also. If you  have not, will you be so kind as to forward your resignation to the  President of the Board of Young University—George Q. Cannon.    Respectfully your Brethren,    Wilford Woodruff  Geo. Q. Cannon  Jos. F. Smith

 you are placed, The Lord never called men  in any age of the world to perform a greater work  than we are called to do in our day & generation  The Lord has decreed to esstablish his Kingdom  upon the Earth in the Last days to be thrown  down no more forever and he has put this work  into our hands to do therefore let us be faithful  & work while the day lasts for soon the night will  come when no man can work. I have been  much pleased to hear of the progress of the work  under your presiding. I receive frequent  Litter from Wilford & from others all give  a good Account of you. Concerning matters with us  I will say it is a [g'eneral] time of health with us  your Father passed through a very severe sick  turn a short time since, the sickest time he  has ever had in these Mountains but has  fully recovered, we are again setting in a Legistor  time capasity and are getting along very well   we have received Gov.

You of course have heard 
 of the accident of Brother Mousley in New Jersy being mas-  hed up in a rail car I have not heared from him  of late do not know whether he will live or die.

 PRESIDENT'S OFFICE,   Salt Lake City, Utah, June 29, 1888.    Elder Brigham Young,    Dear Brother:    Your brief letter of the 17th has just reached   me. I am not surprised to hear from you of the fatigue and lameness which you feel   in consequence of the hard trip that you have taken. You have passed through a very   rough country, and if you have had many miles of road to make you have had a tedious   time.    There is nothing particularly new since I last   wrote to you, excepting that we are still progressing somewhat in our attempt to aef-  fect a settlement of the Church suit; but as we progress the hunger of the officers   seems to increase. A comparison was made to us by a man not of our faith that they   reminded him of wolves sitting and licking their chops, waiting for their prey. Their   eyes glare at the mention of property with the same eagerness and hunger that wild   animals have when they scent their prey. But the Council has decided that we had   better do everything we can to effect a settlement, even if it takes all the property   that they claim. We would liked you to have been with us to have given us your views   upon the subject. It wis with great reluctance that we do this—the same reluctance   with which we have yielded our property in days past, when armed mobs have stood 
 around and driven us from our homes and taken possession of that which the Lord had   given to us. But this will stop these painful proceedings before the Examiner, and   will perhaps be the means of saving our temples and meeting-houses and sacred places   from direct attacks, if it does not savie them entirely; at least, we hope so. The case   of course, will be carried up to the court of last resort for its decision.    My health and the health of the brethren general-  ly is good. Brother Grant has not been well; but has been able to attend our two last   Councils. Yourself and Brothers Thatcher and Teasdale are the only ones absent now   of the Quorum. With love and praying the Lord to bless you and preserve you from every   evil, in which Brothers Geo. Q. and Jos. F. join,    I remain,    Your Brother,   Wilford Woodruff

 L. D. S. Historian's Office,    P. O. Box 321,    Salt Lake City, Utah, May 3 1887    Dear Brother Brigham    Your Welcome Letter of April   19 is received and I was very glad to hear   from you. I was vary much pleased with   the spirit of your Letter Now with regard to   Brother Tenney, I will say I did not know   that He had any Appointment by any bady  One Except the Mission I gave him to the   Zonies, Lagoonies, Islata &c. while I was in that   country He done Nothing in the Mission after   the Rail Roading commenced And after He   came out of prision and broke down financia-  lly and in spirit & health We could not Expect   him to do much at Missionary Work at present   But in coresspondence with the presidency we   have thought it Wisdom to Esstablish a   mission with the Maricopas, Pemos Papagoes and   then reach the Yaquis but not to begin with the  Yaquis first. And having travelled with Tenney   and knowing that He could preach Well in spanish   I thought He would make one good hand with   a company of 4 or 6 as the case might be to Engage   in that Mission He might not be a suitable   man to Lead in it I have written to him upon   the subject and it would Meet his Mind to Engage 
 in that Mission. I did not know that he had   Labored among the Navajos or had a Mission   to them. He helped Baptise 115 Zunies and   Labored some 6 months with the Islata I am   Satisfied Brother Brigham that as the Gentilses   are so fast and so thoroughly rejecting the   Gospel that it is our Duty to more thorou-  ghly commence to Esstablish Missionary  Stations among the Lamanite throughout   this Western world. Now of course I do not   know what instructions you have received from   the presidency concerning your Mission or to what   Extent But as the Navajos Join on to those   Northern tribes I should think that you   ought to have the oversight of the Oribas   Moquis, Zonies Lagoonies & Islata. The Islata  are a very rich intelegant indostrios people, ther   City Numbers 3 or 4000 They are 12 Miles below   Albukirke you have probably been there They have   vary rich vineyards orchards & fields. John   King was ther old patriark when we was there,   We held 2 Meetings with the Lagoonies and the   Govorner & spiritual Adviser went with us to   Islata and staid with us while there, where   We Returned they went up the River but said they   would be back as soon as we did, but they did   not come If they had been there we should   have baptized the whole village and there has   been No preaching there since to my knowledge 
 L. D. S. Historian's Office,    P. O. Box 321,    Salt Lake City, Utah, May 3, 1887    [written in pink ink] I will now say according to my view it is of   but Little use to baptize the Lamanites   and then go and Leave them without any guide  They should be organized and some judicious   Elder apointed to Labor with them and teach   them both by precept & Example, before they can   be qualified to Live as Latter Day Saints, and   we shall have to adopt that policy Hereafter   as far as we can    [written in black ink] I gave Brother Milton S. Ray   a Mission a good while ago to preach to the   Maricopas and Esstablish a school among them   which He has done and I understand thye the   children are learning fast. Brother Ray is   now in Salt Lake City He took his wife   there because she was sick his Location   is in Messa City but it is so hot there   the Sisters can hardly Live. My Daughter   Bell Moses has come home to her Mothers   in Smithfield with her children she is   almost Dead with the Heat. Brother Moses is   calculating to sell out and come North   in consequence of the Sickness of his Wife   If we Esstablished a Mission among these South-  ern tribes I did not Expect they would get at 
 ^it^ untill fall, and my view was for them to   commence with the Maricopas and Pimas located   on Salt River and work South through the   Papagoes and others untill they Reach the   Yaquis. It will be a good while before they would   reach the Yaquis. Of course we want all the   Wisdom we can get to carry out these Missions   Missions among the Lamanites. I admire   your views very much to get the permit   approbations & all the assistance we can from   the Authorities of Mexico, to assist us   in so imporant an undertaking. Of course   we want Men who can speak spanish to   Engage in those Missions There should not   be less that 4 to go upon that Mission   so when they seperate there can be two together    [written in pink ink] I had a few names in my Mind which I  think I sent to president Taylor for his   Approval ^Big^ T. W. Brookbank A M Tenney, J P J   Christofferson one Stewart at Kanab And a young Man   whose Mother a Widow ^Greer^ at the Meadows I have not the   two last names before me    [written in black ink] I would Like your   views Brother Brigham in this Matter what   would you think of Brother Brookbank as   a Leader and Tenney & Stewart as counsellers   I am Well acquainted with Brother Brookbank   I should think He would make a good Leader    [written in pink ink] I was sorry the Mexicans killed Cajeme the Yaqui Chief    [written in black ink] Have the Mexicans taken possession of ther Land 
 L. D. S. Historian's Office,    P. O. Box 321,    Salt Lake City, Utah, May 3 1887    Now I have got through speaking of the mission   I will write of sumthing Els. Of course I would  would be pleased to be With you and take   a Hunt in the Mountains, but I Expect I   would tire out rather rather sooner than I used   to. I am in good health & spirits, but I got   tired out in half a days tramp I am today   where you left me. I take the same boat and   go & get and get a few ducks in the season but   now I ownly ketch a string of club fish, in   the same pond the club weigh from 6 to 20 oz   each net may go over 1 lb but they are very good   Eating for a change, and quite plenty in the season   I have seen half a Barrel in 10 foot square. I   spend most of my time in my Room in   my Room reading & writing or rather  scribling as you will learn before you get through   reading this Letter. I dont pretend to write   so any body can read it without the gift   of translation. But I can read it as well   as I can Capt Hoopers. As I cannot preach   in public I go to the Temple and do what I can   for my Dead. I met 125 friends, in the Temple   on the 2 March, the day following my birth day, 73, 
 of them went through for my Dead. I spoke   to them a short time But Left the city the same   Evening, this is the first time but one that   I have spoken to any company in the capacity of   a meeting for 28 Months I was sealed for   73 couple of Dead friends, while there which   makes 3000 souls of Dead friends while I   have had Baptized Endowed & sealings,   for, and have 265 more to attend to to finish   up my Record, which I hope I may Live   to Accomplish wile it I received a good   Letter from Moses Thatcher giving me a whole   history of all the Mexican Mission which was   very interesting to me    [written in pink ink] The amount of Land bought   was 10000 Acres at Diaz  48000 [Acres at] Juarez   75000 A Carralis  133000 Acres total    Also $76000. dollar worth of   Machinery in operation   A 25 Horse power, Engine with   saw, shingle & Lath Mill, plaining &c.

I got a good   Letter from Joseph F. Smith He got Well   again in a great Measure.    [written in black ink] Concerning   affairs in Utah I Expect you get   most of the News from the papers.

June 4th, 1889    Elder Brigham Young,    Dear Brother:    In your favor of the 28th you ask the question,  "Will you help the settlers at Ramah in their expenses in the court? It will  come to that, no doubt; they will ask me that question."    We sincerely hope that they will not be under the   Necessity of carrying their case into the courts; for our experience in this  direction is very discouraging.  We cannot expect justice, judging by the treatment  that we have received in the past.    With love to you and praying the Lord to bless you,    I remain your brother,    W Woodruff

 OFFICE OF  The First Presidency  of the  Church of Jesus Christ  of  Latter-day Saints.    P. O. Box B. Salt Lake City, Utah, Feb. 5, 1896.    Elder Brigham Young,    Dear Brother:    Inasmuch as you have been appointed to  attend the San Juan Stake Conference, which will be held at Bluff on the  22nd and 23rd insts., we wish you to consider the following items of  business while there. You may find it necessary to release the Presi-  dent of the Stake and Bishop Neilsen of the Bluff Ward, in consequence  of their advanced age and growing infirmities. We suggest Platt D.  Lyman for President and Cumen Jones for Bishop should you find it agree-  able and proper to make such changes. Of course you will consult the  feelings of the people in these matters. We understand the spiritual  and temporal prosperity of the Stake require a change in the adminis-  trative officers.    The Burnham Ward should have another Bishop. Bro. Luther  Burnham seems to consider the labor of presiding in that ward too oner-  ous in his present straitened circumstances, and that a more active man  would suit the people better. If you find this to be the case, make  such changes as may be necessary for the spiritual and temporal prosper-  ity of the people of that ward.    The Jensen case ought to be handled with care. If, on inves-  tigation, you find that Bro. Jensen of Mancos was justified in not  attending the San Juan Conference recently held at Fruitland, continue  your investigation of the case, which he (Jensen) submitted to us, at  the Stake Conference which will be held at Bluff on the 22nd and 23rd  insts. 
 Use every precaution compatable with your duty, to save the  feelings of Prest. Hammond and also the feelings of all those brethren  who are in trouble and have to meet these charges and have judgment  passed upon them.    God bless you.    Your Brethren,    Wilford Woodruff  Geo. Q. Cannon  Jos. F. Smith 
 First Presidency Letter to BY  Instructing him in San Juan  Matters    Feb. 5 [18]956 
 OFFICE OF  The First Presidency  of the   Church of Jesus Christ  of  Latter-day Saints.    P.O. Box B. Salt Lake City, Utah March 5, 1898.    Elder Brigham Young,   "El Carmelo,"  Pacific Grove, California.    Dear Brother Brigham:    We were much interested in listening to your  letter of Feb. 24th, but grieved to hear that Sister Lizzie's progress  towards recovery is so slow and her weakness so great. We commend your  faith, and with you we believe that the promises made in her behalf will  be fulfilled. You have our sincere and constant prayers that it may be  so. In this feeling we are encouraged by the receipt of your telegram  on President Woodruff's birthday in which you state that she is improv-  ing. We trust your own health remains good. Ours, we are happy to say,  is excellent.    The weather here has changed from winter to  spring—dry, clear and pleasant. This gives us hope that it is the same  on the coast, and if so, is more propitious for Sister Lizzie's recovery  as well as more agreeable for yourself. The early advent of spring in  this region has, however, given cause for considerable apprehension of a  scarcity of water next season, as the snow in the mountains surrounding  this and neighboring valleys is said to be far below the average.    We had a call yesterday from Mr. Kraft who gave  us a full particulars concerning your situation and the condition of   Sister Young, and he spoke of your devoted attentions to her in her  sickness. He told us also of the faith which you and your daughter  Katie, his wife, have in relation to Sister Young's recovery. We appre- 
 ciate his kindness in calling upojn us as we were quite desirous to  learn all we could about you.    Prest. Smith has been east for the last two weeks, he is ex-  pected back Monday afternoon.    Of course you will have learned of the death of James T. Little  His sisters were quite anxious to have him buried in temple clothing,  but we could not see the propriety of permitting it.    We join in love to you all. You have our faith and prayers.  The Lord bless you.    Your Brethren,    Wilford Woodruff.  Geo. Q. Cannon

F. Smith  Salt Lake City, Utah.    Dear Brethren:    Enclose a  communication, receipted bills and account just  received from the President of the Birmingham  Conference, Henry Wood. He succeeded S. W. Western  in the presidency and after whom ^(S. W. W.)^ many anxious  enquires are ^made^ by his releatives and strangers. You  can see by Bro. Woods letter the situation at a glance.  Will you kindly refer this matter to Bro. Western and  who may be found at or near Fillmore, and perhaps  he will take immediate steps to remove the cause  of distress which now afflict the brethren.    I am pleased to inform you that success  is met with by brethren in their ministerial labors  in a few places in the mission. Since we con-  centrated the force of the Conference in London, things  are looking up a little in that city. Baptisms occur  occasionally, and the brethren are pushing outdoor meet-  ings with Considerable zeal, in fact, this is the rule  throughout the mission, Hiring Halls is useless for the  people will not come to hear the elders, but street 
 preaching seems to suit the spirit of the times better.    We are in good health and prospering in  all departments to a limited extent. The office business  in every particular is right up to the mark ^Mr^ Tenbroeck  to the Contrary notwithstanding. We are obliged to send  emigrants sterage when ^their means is limited^ they can go no other way; and  we cannot send advices, particulars in numbers and  items of age destination etc, matter for making out their  tickets on that side of the water only as we have been  doing, for we cannot cable all these particulars, ^it would be too expensive^. In  future we shall write Mr. T. by the vessel preceeding  the sailing of companies that, saints are expecting to sail  we on such a vessel, with all the data we are in possession  of, which will not be sufficient to enable him to make  out the RR. tickets, for changes occur up ^to^ the day  of sailing.    God is blessing our labors, and tho' the weather is  cool yet it is warm enough to bring health to me.  Mrs Y is better now ^in health^ than at any time ^previous^ while residing on  this Island.    We are praying for your continued welfare, &,  ^also^ mourning over the political ^complications^ which seem to crop out in  unlooked for quarters to an alarming extent. God help  us to keep up this end of the even or. Our hands are  full, and often our hearts are too full and God alone  can relieve us of the burthen.    Love to the brethren. Praying God to prolong your lives  I am your brother in Christ.    The brethren join in love.    Brigham Young

[sideways text end]    Presedents Wilford Woodruff  George Q. Cannon  Joseph F. Smith  S. L. C. Utah U. S. A.    Dear Brethren:    Enclose you  a letter from Prests. T. Metz who wishes to be releived, person-  ally, and have the Netherlands Mission account cred-  ited the amount of emigration money paid for  the parties named viz £ 30. 9. 6. His proposition to have  the note transfered to me or to this office is altogether  inadmissable but as Bro. M. felt positive that the elder  would pay it, and no doubt Bro Brown is equally as  sanguine, tho' I have had my faith much shaken un-  der simelar circumstances, perhaps you will do something.    The Netherlands Mission needs assistance—more  elders. I found Prest. Metz in very poor health and he  had but two efficient assistants Bros A. Farrell and   Hyde. Bro. Subert is not advanced in the langu-  age far enough to render much help for the present.  The labors of these brethren are ^at^ Rotterdam & Amsterdam, with  their hands full, indeed, a portion of the time they are badly  over worked. Neither Bro. Farrell nor Hyde are in robust   health. Prest. Metz is quite feeble; poor food, cold weather,  exposure and over work have made a great change in 
 rugged man. Unless the genial climate of Arizona restores  him to his normal condition of health I doubt his living  very long. I was more surprised to find him in this con-  dition because I have known him as arough and ready  pontuismans able to endure every hardship.    Bro. Farrell understands the business of the Mission  and speaks the language very well. Bro. Metz has all confi-  dence in him and feels sanguine that he is competent to suc-  ceed him in the presidency of the Dutch or, rather Nether-  land Mission. Bro F is not more than 24 years old but  has much experience at home and abrodt. However the  the Mission must have a presedents ^perhaps you can send a man.^ Bro. Metz must be  released and will part sometime in November. The  saints love him and they also love the other elders, Bro. M.   has done a good work.    More elders are needed. There are but four elders at present  in the Netherland Mission and there ought to be not less than   twelve. Brussels 2; Antwerp two; Liege two; Holland  six. From the best information I can obtain and good work can  be done in that country if help is given them.    The British Mission still lives but the pulse is feeble. Turkish  Mission is struggling for existence. The brethren are encouraged by the   Spirit, not externals. With a little trouble I could meet the Turk-  ish Minister, it is a great thing in the world to be known, and I  have noticed a revolution in the feelings of educated classes in  this country.

 LATTER-DAY SAINTS',   EUROPEAN PRINTING PUBLISHING   AND EMIGRATION OFFICE.    42, Islington, Liverpool.    May 24 1895    President Wilford Woodruff    Dear Brother    On May 21st there   were four Scandinavian Missionaries returned   to Utah and charged to the Church account,   one of them was Niels Peter Larsen of Pleasant   Grove Utah County, whom President E H Anderson   of the Scandinavian Mission reported on his   list as a returning Missionary, but in his   letter of advice to us he says. "Elder Niels   P Larsen came here last summer on genealogical  business but was so successful among his  friends that he remained to assist in the  mission where he has done a good work among   his relatives and acquaintances. If you   can pass him he will feel well over it, but   if not why he will either pay or give you a   note" and as we had not authority   to pass him free, we took the enclosed note   for £14.17.6, which is just the cost to this   office of sending him from Copenhagen to Utah,   and told him if any other arrangements were   made they would have to be made with you.    Yours truly  Brigham Young  JCC    P S we have not passed the   amount of note through our books

 Deseret July 11th 1892    President. W. Woodruff    Dear Brother    I received a communication  from you on Friday Last  and have noted its contents  and must say in reply  that in the main the  Letter of Brother Wood  & President Young are  correct that is the  charges against me  in the first place. I had  the chapel in Birmingham  Repaired up as it was going  to ruin and thought we  could raise money enough  in the Birmingham Conference  to pay the bill but I was  mistaken, I raised what   I could and told Brother  G. T. Spokes I would be-  come responsible for  the Balance due ten pounds  my self as I felt when  I returned home to lay  the matter before the 
 Bishop and Counsel also  the Teachers Qourum  and I thought it would   be easy to raise the money  but I was mistaken  Some have promised to  help and I have waited  month after month in  the vain hope that many  would assist me    I also owe Mr Dean the  tailor for one suit of  Clothes. 4. Pounds he  was very kind and made  me the offer and said  time and again that I  need be in no hurry  I told him as soon as  I returned home I would  send the money as soon   as I could get straightened  around. I also owe Brother  Grant Z Bullock 3. dollars  and my Sister ten pounds  all of which I promised  to return at an early date  but the money belonging  to the Spendloves ^Boy^ is not 
 quite correct, he gave me  a check for ten dollars  this Spring early and told  one to send it to his  folks it was some time  before I could get a   ten dollar bill for it  some time after he asked  me if I had sent it. I  told him no as I had  only just got it changed  but would, he went off  with a sheep herd and  after he left I concluded  to keep the money untill  the boy came back to deseret  and let him send it him-  self then if there was any  loss it would not by my  fault; he came here in  June and I wrote a  letter to his folk, with  him put in the money  and had him mail it  himself, and I presume  his parents had the money  when President Wood  wrote to President Young 
 Now for all the Excuse I   have to offer, when I left  England I thought I could  go to work on my return  home and raise the money  and send it back in  a very short time, and  I delayed writing thinking  I would have the cash to  send very soon, I began  work the first week on  my return home in the  shop I am a Blacksmith  by trade, there was some  freighting going on ^to^ the  Fish Spring Mines I  done lots of work in  fixing up teams and soon  had over $100.00 owing  me but I could not get  the money they put on   more teams to haul I  worked hard and about  the last of October they  the owners of the Mines  soop stoped the teames  from hauling and the  boys were all in debt 
 for wagons and other  things and the stores  took all there pay and  I have not got my  money yet but have  waited and expected it  every month and failed  to get it, I sold a mare  harness & Wagon this spring  for $150.00 trusting to  get the money to pay off  those debts but have  not been able to collect  a dollar in casth on  it as yet, I have offered  a mare and colt valued  at $20000. for $10000 in  order to pay the debt. I   have also offered to sell  my water stock in the  Deseret Irrigation Company  for 50 cents on the dollar  and cannot do so. I have  several hundred dollars  oweing me but cannot  collect unless I sue for  it, and now I am  mortgageing my home  to raise the money to 
 pay the amount I owe  which I amc determined  to do at an early date I  feel heartly ashamed of  myslef, the reason I  failed to write to those  parties was because I  expected to have the money  to send every money and  I wanted to money to go  with the letters, but I  will write and make matters  right and will send the   money at an early date  I expect in a short  time to have the money  as I have applied for a  loan on my home and  have the promise of it  and am anxious to pay  every dollar I owe God  being my helper, and I  believe I done some good  while on my mission and  I have not lost the good  Spirit, and there is no  harder wroker in this  wrard than myself 
 for the building up of the  Kingdom, and I can say  there is no man in  this county or stake that  would respond quicker  to the call to go and  preach the gospel than  Elder. S. W. Western, and  I would be willing to go  right back where I was  if it was neccessary  ever willing to abide  counsel and do what  is required of me  and hoping this will be  Satisfactory I remain  your Brother in the  Gospel    Samuel. W. Western    I would be pleased to   hear from you again  S. W. W

W. Woodruff  & Counsellors    Dear Brethren:    Your favor 16th  oct. received. I am grateful to you for Contents,  and have failed to carry out your kind per-  mission to close the printing in this office  perevious to Bro Andersons departure. However  we have counselled over the situation tho-  roughly, I believe, and have Concluded to shoot  up the press and let that ^work^ out first. Bro A. was  opposed to shutting up the composing loan; ^he^ thought  we could do better to keep it running for the present.  I shall consider it thoroughly before I move contrary  to his advise in this matter. I am strongly impressed   to leave the building, and shall work with that end  in view, as the Lord opens the way and the spirit  intimates.    I have called my son Albert into the office &  also Bro. Callister. Albert has taken Bro. Cut-  lers place. Wilby is here and has the spirit of  his mission, we shall get on very well no doubt.  The fog and rain, cold damp atmosphere, were telling  on me and I wanted my son near me. He is Competant 
 to fill the place I believe, for in advance of some  who have taken that department heretofore. Bro  Cutler & Bro. Anderson have dwarfed their predecessors,  and left a splendid record to guide their successors.    It seems necessary to send a few more companies.  Twenty souls, emigrants, and seven elders sailed on  the Arzona saturday. Another Company of eighteen  emigrants and about seven elders will sail  on the SS Nevada 5th prox. ^Wisconsin^ 22nd inst. Another  company will sail on the 5 of Nov. S.S. Nevada    Shall confine the numbers going on these vessels  to 25 souls or thereabouts. There are saints who  want to go later in Nov. perhaps a company on  the S.S. Arizona which sails on the 12th prox.  If it is convenient will sail with my family  on that date for N. Y. I shall return on her ^Arizona^ so  far as I know at present unless otherwise instructed  by you.    The tithing of the mission has, through hard times,  sunk to nothing. Fair prospects for converts in some  places, considering the times. The elders are hopeful  and have put in good work during the summer in out-  door preaching.    Mrs ^sister^ Esselman has sued Guion & Co. for goods destroyed ^by fdisinfecting on Wyoming N Y.^  or threatened to do so. She had better sue the state. Mr. Rams-  den much annoyed with this complaint for he was power-  less to help it. I have assured him of my feelings on the subject.    Love to the brethren in which we all join    Your Bro in Christ Brigham Young 
 42 Islington L.pool Eng.  Aug 20th 1892.    Prest Wilford Woodruff  Salt Lake City Utah    Dear Brother: I have no   desire to increase your burdens, God knows  you have enough to bear, but I have been much  exercised concerning a few points contained in  Bro. Roberts lecture ^which he^ delivered before the mMutual iIm-  provement Ass[ociati]on on authority of Priesthood.    I quote a few a fewseveral items which have come  to my mind, and in all that I say I desire to give  no offensce to my brethren in any particular. I can  not say there is one iota of untruth contained in the  lecture, but in my judgement the lecturer does not ex-  plain, sufficiently, points of vital importance. These ^points^  have a double signifficance at this period of political  excitement; and ^the^ puting forth "liberal" ideas ^in political matters^ which  have brought our Republic to the verge of desolution,  and will ^yet^ prove an important factors in the ultimate  overthrow of man made governments, vis perfect freedom  to lie debanch, the stronger oppress the weak, the rich grow  richer the poor grow poorer; the spirit shrinks and the body  enlarge its beastly propensities, are distressing to contemplate.    Please give mey ideas consideration and send me the  advice and counsel that is necessary to make ^me^ wise as a 
 serpent and harmless as a dove.    I have always believed that, when when Christs author-  ized servants had it revealed unto them that a certain  man was the individual to preside over the church—His  church, this might be sustained, but not revoked by His people.  I have the privilege of showing to God and man that, I am  in harmony with that revelation and my sign of cove-  nant is the evidence, which I can produce on the spot,  of my unswerving allegiance to Him. All things are done by  common consent which comes through obedience to the  head.    "Joseph presided over the church by the voice of the   people." Very true, and the people were the church  of Christ because they sustained His prophet, which  is equally true.    "Joseph presided over the church etc." "The people chose  to have it so." "He always filled that station by the voice  of the people." These statements are all true, but I think  that, with^out^ further explenation they are calculated to mis-  lead the minds of our children. If it is deemed wisdom  to leave these things as they are—as they appear in print, I  am content. Please render me a little assistance to put  the break on with a little more force.    "Eeclesiastical governments as well as civil derive  their just powers from the consent of the governed." I am in-  clined to think that, there is a destinction between h the ^two^ govern-  ments, God calls and authorizes a man, he gathers the people  and they sustain him. Men gather and appoint ^or elect^ their  head. One originates in God, the other in man. 
 In comparison, God has a fine stepper properly harnessed  to his ^beautifuly proportioned vehiacle^ to bear the burthen; while man has nothing but  a push cart. True, majorities controle in the world &  they ^the wicked^ will seek to push this doctrine upon us, on purpose  to destroy the church. I know their cunning is not equal to  the wisdom of God, and I pray for strength to stand when  these two powers will, apparently, so nearly tie that the boldest  will tremble in the conflict. A bare majority of the people may  reject the prophets of God and by their votes sustain men more con-  genial to their tastes, but in doing this they cut out the only receiving  office on the line through which revelation can come to them. The mai-  jnority who sustain the prophet by their votes, are all that is left of the  church of Christ.    The agency of man consists in his having ^had^ power delegated  to him to select his master. I exercise my will power by being  obedient to the chosen of the Lord. I believe our youth should be  taught to sustain the authorities of the church irrespective of  of numbers. I fix my eyes upon you; I listen to your counsel,  I try to live to have the same spirit that actuates you. The testimony of  the spirit in one is that, your mistakes—should you make any—will be  overruled by God for His glory and the good of His people. I beseech  the Father to give me strength to follow you as you follow Christ our Lord.    Will the time ever come when a majority of those claiming mem-  bership in the church—whatever object they have had in joining the  church—will reject the Presidency and Apostles by vote in the general  assembly of the people. I beleive the devil has that little game on foot—  that is, the idea, exists in the hearts of men today.    I am content to leave things as they are for now I feel better. If I  have hurt your feelings in any wise forgive me. I could not rest until I had  chatted with the presidency.    I strive to do my duty in my weak way. In contrast with the brightness  of the more youthful elders, there is much of the old fogy in me I find.    Love to the brethren. God bless you dear brother  I am your^s^ in Christ    Brigham Young

 [sideways text]  Brigham Young  Sept. 22nd 1892  [end of sideways text]    LATTER-DAY SAINTS'  EUROPEAN PRINTING PUBLISHING  AND EMIGRATION OFFICE.    42, Islington, Liverpool    Sept. 22nd 1892    President Wilford Woodruff, George Q. Cannon and  Joseph F. Smith; Dear Brethren:    Your cable received and  it met our hearty endorsment. Our next company sails  on the S.S. Alaska 1st prox, and numbers about thirty (30)  souls: This is the last company we shall send until things  look more favourable. We expect the "Arizona" to sail on  the 15th prox. and she will carry a number of our elders,  Bro. Jas H. Anderson among them. We shall welcome  Bro. Dougall and trust that he is all sufficient to  fill the place on the Star, vacated by Bro. Anderson.  We could not expect him to be as efficient as Bro. Jas. in  every department: he must live many years and improve  every moment of his time in order to reach the plane of  intelligence to which Bro. Anderson has attained. I tell you  brethren I am a mere babe in current intelligence: and  I believe that it needs a much more intelligent man  than myself to carry on this business successfully—that is  keep the mission and the Star up to their present status.  I beg of you brethren to send as many missionaries this   fall as you convieniently can. I wish we had two hun-  dred more men in the field. True we do not make  many converts, but what we are doing requires more  help. The neglected districts containing millions of 
 people who are ripe for salvation, or damnation,  where the labors of efficient elders are greatly needed,  may be counted by the score; the conference Presidents  appeal to me in vain for more help. If agreeable to  you and circumstances favour it, I shall send my   family home sometime before Christmas: and if you  are willing, shall cross the water to N.Y. with them  providing it will cost nothing for me to go and return.  My wife is timid and will hardly be willing to sail  without me. She could remain in a warm climate,  which would cost money: but funds are scarce  with all parties at present. Bro. Cutler and I visited  Mr Ramsden today: our interview was very satisfactory.  I informed him it was doubtful about our sending  any more emigrants after the 1st prox. until we knew  more definitely concerning actions of those whipper-snappers  on the other side of the Atlantic. He agreed with us  it would be unwise to send companies of emigrants,  especially in consideration of the action taken in relation  to the intermediate passengers on S. S. Pavonia, Cunard line.  The Wisconsin and Arizona are now on the water carrying companies  of our people in 2nd cabin, who may be treated the same as  the Pavonia people—vis. quarintined for three weeks. Your  favour, 9th inst., pertaining to Bro. Dougall just received: I  thank you much for the official information and with the  help of God we shall succeed in our duties so long  as we are relegated to this land. My health has been  precarious: the back part of my head occassioning me  pain and trouble: but I am much better now. The  mission is prosperous and all well. With love  to all the brethren, I am your brother in the   Gospel.    Brigham Young

 [sideways text]  Brigham Young  Oct. 4 [18]92  [end of sideways text]    LATTER-DAY SAINTS'  EUROPEAN PRINTING PUBLISHING  AND EMIGRATION OFFICE.    42, Islington, Liverpool  Oct 4th 1892    President Wilford Woodruff    Dear Brother    I received a letter  from Elder Don C. W. Musser a few days since dated  Haifa, Palestine Sept 6th 1892 in which he says he  and Elder Adolf Haag arrived there on August 31st  by way of Alexandria Port Said and Jappa. There  are but two members of the Church at Haifa.  Bro Grau and Sister Tegel, the latter an old lady who  was desirous of donating 100000 franks for the Turkish  Mission, and had paid him 500 franks of the amount.    He states that since arriving in Turkey Bro Haags  health has not been good, and the day before he wrote  which would be Sept 5th he complained of not  feeling quite well and so went and laid down.  In about an hour he awoke burning up with fever,  in a few moments he was so weak he could hardly  sit up and his heart was very much affected, and  for a time Bro Musser was very much alarmed. He  administered to him, and his heart became better but  his fever was alarmingly high, he doctered him as best  he could all day but about 3 oclock in the morning  be became worse. They gave him a good sweating  and when he woke he appeared to be better and was 
 resting niceley. and they felt confident the Lord would  spare him to complete his mission and let him  return to his loved onces in Zion, he thought it  would be unwise to keep him in Turkey and  thought the climate of Germany or Switzerland  would suit him better, and I intended  making the change, but it was not to be, for  the next news that I received was a Telegram  from Bro Musser dated Haifa 8 pm received  last night saying "Elder Haag is dead"  signed "Muszer," which I presume is intended  for Musser.    Elder Haag arrived here  March 15th having left his home at Payson  Feby 18 [18]92, he labored in the Swiss & German  Mission until the beginning of July, when he  started for the Turkish Mission. We shall  anxiously await Bro Mussers letters with  details and will on their arrival immediately  write you. Praying God to bless and comfort  his wife and family I remain    Your brother in the cause of truth  Brigham Young  &c    PS I cabled Elder Musser  "Deepest sympathy, inter with view of  sending remains home." 
 yet some orchards will bear a middling crop—some very  fine apples in the orchards.    President Young's apple trees are some of them  loaded, and a good crop of peaches; his grape vines are  loaded, I think he will have 2 or 3000 lbs of grapes this   season.    It is a general time of health in this Territory except   a company that came in from the Mississippi brought the   small pox with them, but it has not spread much yet, and  we hope it will not.    A company arrived from Carson Valley on the 28th  inst, they report that Murray, who was tried for murder  last winter was killed by the Indians, also a man by the   name of Reddin.    Your family are all well. Brothers Bates and Luke  Johnson are about to start on a Mission of about one   month, with Seth M. Blair to Ruby Valley on an exploring   expedition to open a new route to Carson Valley. They expect  to meet bro Enoch Reese with a company from Carson to   cooperate with them.    Our Agricultural and Manufacturing Society are  making quite an exertion to promote Home Manufactures  in this Territory, as the time has come when we see that we  are under the necessity of making in a great measure what   we use. The various Wards of the City and Territory are  forming auxiliary branches of the same; intending to Manu-  facture all they can for home consumption.    During this month Elder Parley P. Pratt and a 
 opposite Prest. Young's buildings.    On the 29th Ulto we had a general muster and inspection  of the Nauvoo Legion. Lieut. Gen. Wells and his staff received the  troops, after which a hollow square was formed and the Lieut. Gen.   delivered an animating address to the troops, which was well sustained  by the officers of his staff and chaplain.    We have had much excellent preaching lately by the First  Presidency and others. Prest. Young has come out boldly and told this  people in the name of the Lord, they must repent and be baptized  for the remission of their sins. Several Wards have gone forward  en masse been baptized and renewed their covenants before the Lord,  and I believe the fire of a universal reformation in this Territory  has been lit and will continue to burn, until a permanent  foundation for good works has been laid in our midst. We must   say since the organization of this church our ears have never been  saluted with more pointed Godlike sermons, than have flowed lately  from Prest. Young and his counsellors.    We are happy to announce the arrival of Elders F. D.  Richards, Daniel Spencer, Jos. A. Young W. H. Kimball Geo. D.   Grant, James Ferguson, John Van Cott, C. H. Wheelock, N. H. Felt,  Wm. C. Dunbar, J. T. D. McAlister & James McGaw.    yours truly    W Woodruff 
 On the 31st October, brother Gideon D. Gibbs and Horace  Newell arrived from Elder Willie's hand cart coy., whom they left on  the sweetwater, when the teams sent out at conference arrived at  this camp, there had been twenty deaths, nineteen of them men.  and while with them in one day there were fifteen burials, and when  the messengers left there had been fifty deaths. They did not seem  to be sick, but chilled through, men would dig graves for their  brethren, and before night would die themselves. They had distributed   their last rations of Flour the night before the brethren met them  and they did not know that any relief was at hand.    The reason of this difficulty and suffering [ink faded] with the  emigration is in consequence of the companies starting so late, and   the early falling of snow in the mountains. Prest. Young has  universally given counsel for the emigration to start early.    The hand cart companies who started early came in well indeed  better than the most sanguine could have expected.    yours truly,  W. Woodruff
