He was followed By W. Woodruff I said there was one subject I wished to speak upon &amp; that was writing  &amp; keeping a Journal of the dealings of God with us I have many times  thought the Quorum of the Twelve &amp; others considered me rather enthu- siastic upon this subject But when the Prophet Joseph organized the Quorum of the Twelve he Commanded them to write &amp; keep a Journal or History of their lives &amp; gave his reasons why they should do it I think the Twelve Apostles &amp; all the Holy Priesthood should keep a Journal of their official acts &amp; the dealings of God with them I would be glad to read the Acts of My forefathers if they had never  herd of a God. But esspecially when men are called to stand at the head of a Great dispensation like this &amp; to build up the kingdom of God on  the Earth to remain forever, they of all men on Earth ought to write  &amp; keep a true &amp; correct History of the rise &amp; progress of that Kingdom, of the Revelations of Jesus Christ &amp; his dealings with us as we travel   ENDENTRY Jan 20, 1872    Entered this Chirch I was Baptized the first sermon I herd &amp; from  that day untill now I have kept a daily Journal whenever I have herd Joseph Smith preach, teach, or prophesy, I have always felt it my duty  to write it. I have always felt uneasy I could not Eat drink or sleep in peace untill I did write it &amp; my mind has been so Exercised upon this subjects that when I herd Joseph Smith teach &amp; I had not pen- cil &amp; paper I would go home &amp; set down &amp; write that whole sermon almost word for word &amp; sentence By sentence as it was deliver &amp; when I had written it, it was taken from me I remembered it no more this was the gift of God to me &amp; the question has often rested me why are these things so, why has this subject rested upon me more than other men again another Question has rested upon my mind many times? why has the devil sought to take my life from the day I was born untill  now more than other men, for I been a marked victim for the devil from the day I was born untill now, and I can find but  one answer &amp; that is the devil knew if I got into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints I would write the History of the Church &amp; leave on Record the doings, works, &amp; teachings of the prophets &amp; Apostles latter days, &amp; that I would attend to the Ordinances of the House of God. For my Fathers Household &amp; Friends both for the living &amp; the dead. I am the ownly person in all the lineage of my Fathers Household Either on my Father or Mothers side who has been in the Church &amp; in a situation to do any thing for my Fathers House I Baptized my Father &amp; all his household that He had  with him at the time including my half sister I am the ownly person that has attended to any of the ordinances  of the Church for my Dead. Again I have recorded nearly all the sermons &amp; teachings that I Ever herd Joseph Smith deliver &amp; many  of the Quorum of the Twelve I have in my Journals scores of sermons  of President Brigham Young that He does not know that Exist on  Earth so of Orson Pratt, &amp; others, one reason I have Been moved upon to write in Early days was nearly all the Historians appointed in the Early History of the Church Apostitized &amp; took the Journals away with them which in a measure  were lost to the Church. I still keep a daily Journal but I have not   ENDENTRY Jan 20, 1872    &amp; reporters to keep a record of the sayings of the Prophets &amp; Apostles &amp; I rejoice &amp; thank God for it does my soul good to look upon these little Boys sons of Brother George Q Cannon &amp; others set at the reports  table &amp; report the sermons as they are delivered from the mouth of  the Prophets &amp; Apostles I would there were 10 whare their is but one Another Subject I wish to say a few words upon &amp; that is the spirit of God to man, the Holy Ghost which is given to the saints, The  inspiration of the Almighty which giveth the spirit of man under- standing it is the greatest testimony man can possess, his Eyes &amp; Ears  may be deceived in seeing the miracles such as the magicians in the days of fals Prophets &amp; beasts of the last day will  perform  but man is apt to look to high or Expect too great things so that they often times mistake the spirit of God &amp; the inspiration of the Almighty it is not in the Thunder or whirlwind that we should look for the spirit  of God but in the still small voice "The wind Bloweth whare it listeth &amp; ye hear the sound thereof but cannot tell whence it cometh or whether  it goeth so all is the spirit saith Jesus" ##John 3:8## We should all become acquainted  with this spirit &amp; obey its voice for it hath preserved the prophets Apostles &amp; Elders for the last 40 years in their travels upon the Earth. We have all Experienced this from time to time our lives have been preserved by listning to the whisperings of that still small voice. When I was going  to Boston in the spring of 1848 with my family I drove into the door yard of one of the Brethren tied my Mules to a large oak tree &amp; went  to Bed in my carriage with my  me &amp; told me to get up &amp; move my ^carriage^ &amp; my mules I did so &amp; it was but  a short time untill a whirlwing took that oak tree broak it into nom  the ground &amp; brought it some 12 rods &amp; laid it prostrate in that dooryard  &amp; the body of fall whare my carriage stood &amp; if I had not moved it  I should have been killed with my family. Again when I was bri- nging the Eastern Saints to this valley when I arived in Pitsburgh  I chartered a steemboat to take the saints to St Louis as soon as I had done it the spirit said to me dont go abord of that Boat. the Captain released me &amp; I chartered another the steemer that  I first chartered started down the river soon took fire burned   ENDENTRY Jan 20, 1872    to death or drowned many in this Church have Experienced these  things, &amp; in all the travels &amp; Emigrations of the saints for the last  40 years the preserving care of our Hevenly Father has been over  us &amp; we as a people have been preserved while the wicked have been destroyed upon Evry hand, the destruction of the saluda  is the ownly case whare the saints have met with disaster in their Emigration, and if Eli B. Kelsey who was the leader of the company had had the spirit of God &amp; his office upon him he never would have gone on board of that Boat or taken the saints on board of it I would Exhort all the Saints to get the spirit of God &amp; keep it &amp; live under its influence, &amp; then they are always safe.
