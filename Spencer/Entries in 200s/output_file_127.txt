Your suggestions about an organization, as the brethren had at Ann Arbor will be suggested to them and I hope be productive of much good. The action of the U. S. officials with regard to our emigration was brought to my notice in the press dispatches of the morning papers and I wrote to Mr Tenbroeck, a copy of which I enclose. I hope our emigration, under the blessing of God, will not be interfered with.We are striving to be in harmony with the laws but it seems as though the U. S. Government was determined to fill up their cup speedily. Our emigration is very nicely cared for everywhere. Mr Ramsden continues as energetic and careful as ever to have our emigrants well treated.I do not know how such a rumour could have reached you that I had released Elder Frederick Stauffer from the Turkish Mission

I was afraid we wouldnot have sufficient to pay Guion & Co for the seapassage of the June 28th Company and draftswere continually being presented and the moneywanted and our emigration being at a standstill until the 2nd of August I saw we weregoing to be bankrupt, and so cabled for tenhundred, owed us by the office, to save us.Mssrs Guion & Co have just informed us that theWyoming arrived safe in New York yesterdaymorning—the 19th—at 5 a.m. and that they left at3 p.m. the same afternoon. We are rejoicing inthe blessing of God attending our companies.In conversation with Mr. Ramsden I told himI did not know but what we would have toquit sending companies. He asked why? donot they go through all right? I replied yesbut there is so much prejudice against usand the people of the States so stirred up by 
 as I had not thought of such a thing. Brother Stauffer is quietly doing as well as any miss-ionary who ever went to Turkey. I have for-warded him your letter, with a letter from myself and enclosed a five pound note to assist him in expenses. In this weeks "Star" which will [be] issued next Monday there is an inter-esting letter from him under date of May 17th. It bears postmark of a later date and would have been published earlier but I have been away attending conferences and visiting. Bro. J. E. Carlisle is away with br. Heber J. Richards & family visiting London. Bro. Phillips is assisting me on the "Star" He leaves on the 28th of June for Bear Lake. He has been quite a help to me in the editorial department. He has an excellent education and is a gentleman, but I think rather a fierytemper when crossed. His expressions have to be toned down, andbut with me he has been as humble as a child, and treated me with a great deal of respect. I am sorry to lose him, and he expresses sorrow to leave. But the way has opened up for his emigration and I would not detane him. If he continues in the love of the gospel and true humility he will be a great blessing to himself, and likely others.We all join in kind love; the folks at 42 are all well. Ever praying for the blessing of God to attend you now and for ever, Your humble brother in the CovenantGeorge Teasdale

Woodruff & Council.Salt Lake City, Utah.Beloved Brethren:On friday last, 20th inst, the following named missionaries arriv-ed in Liverpool, per Guion S. S. Wisconsin. They spent Sunday with us and were appointed to the Conferences named as follows—Frederick W Chappell, to the Manchester; James H. Clark and Richard Grahamto Leeds; John F. Merrill, Samuel S. Newton and Edmund M. Dugdale to Newcastle; Thomas Wheatley Jr. andCharles Cottrell Jr to Sheffield; Charles T. Black and Prime Coleman to Norwich; Henry Moyle to Bris-tol; James Smith to London & Edward Burton to the Nottingham Conferences; and James H. Cook to the Scottish Mission. These were all for the British Mission. Anders S. Hyrup for the Scandinavian and Joseph A. Young for the Swiss & German Mis-sion.On Saturday 21st June Elders George H. Baugh and wife, Hyrum Ricks and Noah Williams returned home per Guion S. S. Alaska, R. F. Neslen, W. Langton & F. T. Bailey with their wives and some others going to Utah sailed on the same vessel.You referred to Prest J. U. Stucki being released if we had any one to succeed him. There is only Brother 
 the newspapers against our emigration. He smiled"oh never mind that" he said "when you cannotsend companies then we will have to trysome other way."—"You do not send emigrantsin violation of law," no paupers—no contract la-borers—do you? he said—"No" I replied. He thentold me of an interview he once had with theAmerican Consul in Liverpool when Enarts triedto stop the emigration and the Consul asked him ifthe "Mormons" were of the above class &c. He is cheerfuland sanguine, has good faith our people will gothrough all right so long as they honor the laws. Thiswe propose to do by the grace of God and continue totrust in Him. It is His work and He will over-rule all things to suit His glorious will. My onlyanxiety is that His will may be done and Hispuposes fulfilled. I think we are safe if we do Hiswill and keep His commandments. I believe in Hispromise—"If you love me and keep my commandmentsyou shall prosper in the land" [##2 Nephi 4:4##]—Every Latter-day Saintsknows this to be true and they are full of thankfulness,light & truth. Tomorow Elders Hyrum Ricks, NoahWilliams and Geo. H. Baugh return to Zion per S. S. AlaskaBrother Baugh's wife has been here on a visit returns withhim. Bros R. F. Neslen, Wm Langton & wife Bailey &wife, Wm.

All seem to have been benefited by their trip. We are all well at 42 and join in kind loveYour brotherGeorge Teasdale. 
 Theo. Brandley and if he was taken from the office to preside, he would need some one to succeed him. Bro Stucki spoke of a brother residing at Elsinore who was very capable. His name is Richard Haag. He also said he could use twelve good missionaries in the Swiss and Ger-man mission if he had them. There has been a revival in that mission where good competent Elders are. We all want good competent Elders; like everything else there is always room at the top. The Elders generally ^when they arrive here^ do not know much about the principles themselves, and by the time they learn to teach others, and are useful in the ministry, it is time for them to go home; especially is this so where they have to learn the language. If it meets your approbation Prest Stucki will leave for home with the next company from the Swiss and German mission, and Bro. Brandley will be ap-pointed to succeed him. Elder C. D. Fjeldsted ar-rived here November 13th 1886 and Elder Jas. Leaing October 13th, 1886. Will you kindly inform me if you think they should return home. They are bootth very excellent missionaries and of course we hate to part with them, and they are willing to stay until it is deemed wisdom for them to re-turn. I would like your council on the matter that I may be satisfied. Men in the enjoyment of the Holy Spirit only want to be where the Lord wants them, and they have joy in their missions despite the dis-couraging circumstances. Your brother,George Teasdale

 LATTER-DAY SAINTS',EUROPEAN PRINTING PUBLISHINGAND EMIGRATION OFFICE.42, Islington, Liverpool,August 13th 1890.President Wilford Woodruff,and Council.Beloved Brethren:I have the honorof submitting to you, by this mail, our month-ly statement, for the past month, July.Since receiving your esteemed favor of June 27,and later communications, we have endeavoredto fulfil your expressed wish, to arrangethe affairs of the mission, so that when oursuccessor arrived, we could turn over the bu-siness of the mission to him, and make allthe necessary explanations concerning itsdetails &c. This will account for our dis-bursements being rather heavy during thelast month. We paid Fazakerleys bookbindingbill of £96.12.0, our takxes £9.15.4, House cleaningWhitewashing &c £4.3.5, Gasbill £2.6.4, Coal £2.10.6 andso forth. We shall do our best to have every-thing in good shape to turn over to our suc-cessor, all bills paid, and the house clean andcomfortable. We were very much pleased withyour reconsideration of the brother who shouldsucceed me, and acknowledge the hand of Godin it. I am thankful for the kindly consider-ation you have had for me, and very much 
 appreciate your friendship and brotherly love.I am very thankful to God for His sustaining grace.Notwithstanding all the anxieties, cares andtribulations, I have enjoyed the experience ofthis mission exceedingly, and what little goodmay have been done, to God be the glory.  Wehave sought His counsel and He has guided.The broadcast distribution of tracts and printed matter will be like the "bread cast uponthe waters," already do we hear of a spirit ofinquiry being madenifest. I have good faith inprinters ink. The Lord is doing His own work,and it is not by wisdom of man, but by HisSpirit is He accomplishing His mighty purposes.It is a great pity there are so few who believe God.I shall be pleased to receive any instructionsyou may have for me as to my future. Weare all reasonably well at 42, and joinin love to yourselves, our brethren of the Twelve,and the brethren with you in the office.

 LATTER-DAY SAINTS',EUROPEAN PRINTING PUBLISHINGAND EMIGRATION OFFICE.42 Islington, Liverpool,July 30th, 1890.Prest Wilford Woodruffand Council.Beloved Brethren:Since last writingto you I have attended Conferences of the Welshand Scottish Missions. We had excellent meet-ings which were well attended, but the reportswere not very encouraging with regard to bap-tisms. In the Welsh Mission they had not baptizedone in six months, but in Scotland two baptismswere reported, for the six months, and six baptismsin July, since the 30th of June. In the six months 15,531tracts had been distributed, 26 of the cheap edition ofthe Book of Mormon had been sold, and 189 cheap Voiceof Warning. In the Scottish Mission 13,265 tracts had beendistributed by the Glasgow Tract Society, in six months,and 14,619 by the Elders &c in their districts for three monthsreport, making a total of 27,884 tracts distributed, 11 Booksof Mormon sold, 5 loaned, 13 Voice of Warning sold, 8 loaned, 5 givenaway by the Elders, to friends or acquaintance. There is a seeming indifference amongst the people generally, or ifconvinced lack the moral courage to obey; Yetthe Elders are in no wise discouraged, they feelwell, and we hade most excellent meetings. Theand ^elders^ are filled with praise and thanksgiving.There seems to be a deep rooted prejudice against 
 us, and frequently the Elders are insulted, the people re-fusing to receive the tracts, or hold any conversationwith them. The Protestants and Catholics are holding"Demonstrations" in the open air, and in the largesthalls. Last Sunday on Glasgow Green there was a protes-tant demonstration, and they had to be protected bysquads of policeman, which we saw march downto the foot of the Nelson Monument, on Glasgow Green.We live in a momentous age.Your favor of June 30 reached us after Elder Jas.

 The Council of the Twelve Apostles, to the Breth-ren at Winter Quarters, and esspecially tosuch as shall hereafter arrive at thatplace—GreetingBeloved Brethren,We have nowcompleted the organization of the Pioneer Company, of which we are members, and whom we areabout to lead to the Mountains or over the Moun-tains, as we shall be councilled by our Leader insearch of a resting place for ourselves, our families,and all who desire to follow us and work Righteous-ness; and by doing this we prove to you and to allthe world, that we do not wish to be a whit behindthe first of you, in leaving wife, children, friends, rest, or any of the enjoyments of social life; and that weare willing to take our full share of troubles, trials,losses and crosses, hardships and fatigues, wearinessand watchings, for the Kingdom of Heaven's sake; andwe feel to say come calm or strife, turmoil or peace, lifeor death; in the name of Israel's God we mean to conquer or die trying: We mean to open up the wayfor the salvation of the honest in heart from all na-tions or sacrifice every thing in our stewardship, andif we fail in the attempt, having done all we could,Our Father will not leave his flock without a Shep-herd.In connection with the Pioneer Company wehave organized all in your place and vicinity whowish to join the emigration, into companies of Tens, fifties, and hundreds, in two divisions, with a President 
 and two Councillors to each division, with the sanctionof their respective companies, and having called thePresidents, Councillors, and Captains of hundreds to-gether, have advised with them and decided thatall the High Council that is necessary to be leftat Winter Quarters, after the present High Councilshall have left, will be the Presidents and Captainsof Emigration Companies.  And where the present Pres-idents of Divisions and Captains shall remove theywill leave others similarly organized with the approvalof the brethren, or those who thus enter into the organiza-tion.The brethren now organized, have heardthe Word and the Will of the Lord on which this organ-ization is founded and have given their hearty assentunto it, and any hesitancy in carrying out their pledgesor acting in Concert with their Presidency, as they wellknow will be at the loss of a glory that they ^can^ never regain, therefore, we say that that these instructions generallyare more especially to such as shall hereafter arrive at your place; so that they may receive the principles andinstructions that those have had, who have been with us the past winter.The business of the Saints at WinterQuarters from this time is to journey West, until furtherinstructions: and while some will have the means to go forward at the springing of grass, others will have to stop and raise grain to carry with them: andwhile some will come here prepared, others will havestop and prepare for their journey: and in either case, all preparation and organization is for journeying andnot for a permanent location at Winter Quarters, and if any refractory members should make their appear- 
 ance, the Bishops will see that justice is done them, and let no iniquity have place in your midst.It is the privilege of the brethren whoremain, or arrive hereafter, to decide, but the Councilurgently recommends to them to remove the lesser houseson to the line, of Winter Quarters, or on the borders of themost populated blocks, so as to defend themselves, byhouses, pickets, ditches, &c against the Indians, so thatyour women and children may not be insulted andabused, and their tables robbed, while they are draw-ing water, or gathering the fruits of their gardens orattending to any domestic duties, in your absence.Let the brethren labor unitedly in makingfields, fencing, planting, harvesting &c all under the di-rection of their respective captains of Tens and Fifties, -over whom will be the supervision of their Captains ofhundreds and Presidents who will allot to each familyall the ground they need or can till, for a garden, inthe City of Winter Quarters or its immediate vicinity—so that all may share equally in the comforts and luxuries of the table.The Idler shall not eat the breadof the laborer, therefore let a record be kept, by the Captains of each Ten, or his clerk, how each man em-ploys his time, from day to day; and let the same bereported weekly to the Clerk of the division or Presi-dency of the organization; and let one tenth of theavails of each man's labor be appropriated for thebenefit of the poor and sick, under the direction of theBishops, attending to the Council of the Presidency; forthe poor ye have always with you, and the sick often:and he who administers to them, serveth the Lord.Your crops, and cattle will be exposed 
 to the aggression of the Omahaws, and other Indians, andwe say to you take care of them, learn to watch aswell as pray, for the farther you go West, the more you will be exposed and if the Saints cannot watchthem safely here here, what will they do when they get where civilzation or half civilization is unknown. Make good fences around your corn fields, and locatefamilies near sufficient to watch and keep them safe, and let the emigrants be diligent and careful to plow, plant, and fence all they possibly can before theystart on their journey.We advise the brethren to keep theup the a police of their most effective men at WinterQuarters as we have done for  [th] in an hour ye knowthink not, evil may be upon you; and pray themfor their services so that they will not be obliged toneglect your safety, for a loaf of bread, to satisfytheir hunger or that of their families.It is highly important in thisdispensation that every brother learns his duty, and acts accordingly: in doing which, every one whocan, will pay their herdsmen in money, flour, grain, &c as they shall need, for their comfort, or to prosecutetheir journey, and not complete compel them to urgepayment of the Sisters whose husbands are in the army, the Widows, and poor, and let the herdsmenbe diligent in striving to deliver all the cattle &c entrust-ed to their charge, at the proper time, to those whoare emigrating West, and such of those, as cannotpay down, agree upon the Cattle you shall markas your own to be held in society, to be paid for ordelivered to you at a future day. 
 It is our wish and Council that the Em-igration company now formed, shall follow the Pioneers,as soon as the grass is sufficient to support theteams, and the Presidents, and Captains will examineand know that every soul that goes in said Com-pany is provided with from 3 to 500 lbs of bread stuff, or a year and a halfs, and as much more as he canget for we know not whether we can raise corn thissummer, as we anticipate at the place of location.Let the first Emigration company takewith them as many of the Sisters whose husbandsare in the Army, as can fit themselves out, or can beconveniently fitted out.It is wisdom that all the men in theEmigration Company shall be organized into a mili-tary body, under their respective Captains of 10s, 50s,and 100s with Charles C. Rich as their Commanderin Chief who will see that every man is properlyarmed, and ready to meet any savage encounter ata moment's warning, taking care that caps and primingof all firelocks are so secured as to admit of no acci-dents: that John Scot superintend the artillery un-der C. C. Rich—Horace S. Eldredge be marshal—Hosea Stout Captain of the Guard on the journeyand that the guard watch during the night, andsleep as they have during the day:The first company will carry theTemple bell, with fixtures for hanging at a moment'snotice, which will be rung at daylight, or a propertime, and call all who are able to arise to prayers,after which ringing of bell and breakfast, or ringingof bell and departure in 15 minutes to secure thecool of the day till breakfast time &c as the bell may 
 be needed, particularly in the night Seasons, if Indiansare hovering round to let them know you are atyour duty, and if any man acts disorderly, punishhim severely.Whenever a Company of 75 men, who donot belong to the present organized Company, shallbe organized so as to carry out the principles of theWord and Will of the Lord and these instructions,according to the Pattern, with or without families,and provisions enough to sustain each soul 18 months,they may come on till the 1st of July, but in allcases, the brethren must run their own risk for foodand not depend on the pioneers, or any Company inadvance for support in the least, either for their teams,themselves, or families, for we are credibly informed thatmore than 30 souls of the Oregon Emigrants, perishedin the Mountains with hunger the last season; and100 bushels of corn can easier bye raised near WinterQuarters, than the 50 bushels at the foot of theMountains.If a man of the 1st Emigration com-pany, who is going to stop at your place for thetime being, should so far forget his Covenant in theTemple, and his more recent obligations and agree-ments as to retain his wagon or team, from the neces-sities of the journey: it will be the duty of the Presi-dents to instruct the captains to take the same andapply it where necessity requires, and thus compel theowner to do what he had previously agreed to, for assome were compelled to come in, in Ancient days, othersmust be compelled to remain in, ^in^ latter days, and menwho are taken at their word have no reason to findfault.

 Pioneer Camp of Israel. Platt river, about50 miles from Winter Quarters, April 16th 1847.P.S. We recommend the brethren to search for a fordacross the Horn, near where said river leaves the Bluffsof some 20 miles north of the usual ferry, or West ofOld Council Bluffs, as it will save much troubletravel, if such a ford be found, or a good place for a Ferry.

Kempe, return-ing missionaries', the first named through ill healthThere are 134 souls in the company, 67 full, and 25 half fares. Included in this number are two sisters, visitors, who have been visiting their friends in Scotland, Sisters Janet Morris, and Dick.They are in excellent health and spirits, and truly faithful Latter-day Saints. Sister Clara Johnson, and her two boys, returning from a visit to friends; and a good sister, Mary AChambers, leaving all her family and going alone to Zion, to spend her days with the Saints of God. All the others are from Scandinavia.They appear to be a very fine class of ourpeople. I met with them on Wednesday eve-ning last, and I enjoyed much freedom in speaking to them. The president, Bro Ostlund,says, he has had no trouble with them at all in 
 crossing the sea. They are willing and obedient, full of hope. Our good friend Mr Ramsden gave the Elders two state rooms, worth at this sea-son of the year £45.0.0 a room, had refusedpassengers. The saloon and intermediate was full but our people had the best rooms in the ship. He kindly sent me word ^that^ on wWednesday ^that^our company, pr. S. S. Wisconsin, in charge of Leonard I. Jordan, arrived in New York at 7 a.m. and left at 3 p.m., which intelligence was gratefully received, and we praised God in His holiness. Truly has He blessed us, and holds us in His protect-ing care. We are surrounded with wickedness.The Guion Co. is having a good season, I am happy to say. They bless us and the Lord is blessing them.Every berth in the next two ships are engaged. So you see it does not militate against themcarrying the "Mormon" emigration. Our next com-pany is a British company sailing September6th. We expect the Swiss & German Saints willjoin them. We are all reasonably well and join in kindest regards and prayers for your welfareYour brother in the covenant of peaceGeorge Teasdale[sideways text] Geo. Teasdale16 Aug. 1890Recd Aug. 27.

S. Wyoming, in charge of Elder Jens Jensen, with Lars C. Johnson, as his first and Eric Hogan, as his second counsellors. J. A.Farslund and Annie Anderson, wife of Elder Anderson who died on a mission to Denmark, were returned as missionaries, Bro Farslund having been engaged in the Scandinavian Office. The company numbered 187 souls 102 full 39 half fares. There were a few from the British Mission some 23 souls.Elder B. Young and family arrived here on Sep. 4th, on the 5th the passengers for the eighth company arrived and went on board the S. S. Wisconsin in charge of Elder J. U. Stucki with Alfred Budge and C. Meyer as his counsellors.That company numbered 116 souls. Elders Henry Tuckett, John Ischi and Jacob Schweizer return-ing missionaries. These sailed Sep 6.We had a conference announced for Sunday 7th at London I had promised to attend and had to leave 11.5 on Saturday the 6th a.m. 
 So when the Company was properly organized and all the business attended to; I left with BrotherYoung and family to London and attended Conference and returned to Liverpool in time to attend to this 9th Company. Brother Young re-mained until to-day when he left to attend the Norwich Conference and his family returned to Liverpool. With this company we shall close up our seasons business, so far as I am concerned. We have advertised, to send all, who have not been prepared to go in the September companies, that a company will leave ^here Oct 11th^ from any part of the European Mission and we have already a good many names. But we shall now take stock and turn over the business in a proper manner and send you a balance sheet with the September Report, which will close my labors in the Presidency of the British Mission. We were informed by the Guion Co. who received their report from New York that Bro. Young would not arrive until the next sailing of the Alaska, and knew of no difference until I received a letter from Bro W. C. Spence a few days before Bro. Brighams arrival.

 LATTER-DAY SAINTS', EUROPEAN PRINTING PUBLISHING AND EMIGRATION OFFICE.42 Islington, Liverpool,October 4th 18890.Prest W. Woodruff, and Council.Beloved Brethren:I have the honor to forward to you the monthly statement for September and also the report of our business for thenine months. We have taken stock closed up the accounts and have had everything audited and send you the statement thereof for your inspection. There will be bills not paid from £75 to £80 pounds which should be deducted from the Profits and then we have carried some accounts that have been reported year after year as assets to "Doubtful accounts" and charged Profit and loss which will here after put the business in better shape. I cannot but regret that it should have been considered essential to remove me from the Presidency of the European Mission until the seasons business was completed and everything closed up in a business like manner; but I presume my labors are required somewhere else and so hav-ing turned over everything to my fellow laborerApostle B. Young I waive all my personal wishes and hasten to Mexico where D. V. I hope to have the un-speakable happiness to report myself to you face to face I send these statements and reports per Elder Walter Hoge who, having labored some time in the office, will be 
 able to give you any information you may wish concerning the accounts, emigration, or missionary labors of the European Mission.I am thankful to our heavenly Father beyond expression for the experience of the last six years; two of which was spent in Mexico and nearly four in the European Mission. I hope He will accept of my labors and pardon all my short comings and in anything where I have err-ed or failed. What little good that may have been done to Him be the honor & glory. I am well paid in the honor to be His servant. May prosperity attend the European Mission and may the seed sown bring forth much fruit to the honor and glory of the Father and the salvation of many souls.All at 42 join me in kind love to the First Presidency & Twelve.Your brother in the cov[enan]tGeorge Teasdale[sideways text] Geo.

I have beenclosely associated with PresidentGeorge Teasdale during the wholeof my Mission, and for the lastfew months I have noticed him failing and especialy for the pastfew weeks.  Since the death of hiswife father which leaves things in anawkward Shape with his family athome.  Yesterday evening when I leftthe office 42 Islington he was most down Sick with fatigue assisted withsome cold.  He is so eager for theadvancement of the great cause, andbeing very ambitious as well as being placed in a very responsible position 
 with an extensive mission he seems tobe failing and in need of anassistant to take part of the load offof him.I believe the mission is as progressiveas could be expected under the heavytide bearing against it.

 LATTER-DAY SAINTS',EUROPEAN PRINTING PUBLISHINGAND EMIGRATION OFFICE.42 Islington, Liverpool,June 18th 1890Pres. Wilford WoodruffDear Bro.I trust you willnot consider it presumptous in me to address youon a subject which I believe to be necessary anda duty.During the time I have been laboring here in theLiverpool Office I have observed with anxiety thefailing health of our much beloved President, GeorgeTeasdale, and have carefully and prayerfully arrivedat the conclusion that to withhold the facts in the caselonger from you would be dereliction of duty on mypart as a servant of God.Pres. Teasdale had a very severe attack of sicknessin February and I do not think that he has fullyrecovered from the effects of it, and with the careand responsibility incident to his position as Presidentof the European Mission, his health seems to be graduallybut surely getting worse.Of late his affairs at home seem to give him agood deal of anxiety. He feels the loss of Bro. Pictonvery much, and I understnad that since Bro. Picton'sdeath, Pres. Teasdale's affairs at home are not in asatisfactory condition. The strain upon his mind, underhis present bodily condition, seems to be too great and 
 I fear the consequences should he have to continue agreat while longer without a change or the rest whichhe so much needs. I have not arrived at this conclusionmerely from my own observations, but the same opinionprevails with all the brethren whom I have conversed withon the subject and also Sister Teasdale. Dr. Phillips,who has been prescribing for and attending to Pres. Teasdaleduring his sickness, has kindly, at my request, writtenhis opinion in regard to Pres. Teasdale's condition, andI enclose it with this communication.I have carefully avoided letting Bro. Teasdale know aboutthis letter for fear he might object to it's being sent, andthus withhold the facts in the case from you, that I consideryou should be made acquainted with, preferring, likea true and faithful servant of God, anything ratherthan shrink from his duty.Hoping you will kindly forgive me for addressingyou in this manner, which nothing but a sense ofduty would have prompted me to, and ever prayingfor the blessings of our Heavenly Father to rest uponyou and all the faithful I remainYour humble brother in the cause of ChristWalter Hoge[sideways text] Walter Hoge14 June, 1890Recd July 1 [end of sideways text]

Tho' we were all inex-perienced who were left in this office, businesswent smoothly on.Requested you to meet all the Railwayfares from your office, for I found thatmany drafts had been sent to Cover expence ofemigrants and we received but little moneyfrom them. This last payment to Guion & Co hasreduced our finances a little lower than I thinkthey ought to be considering the responsibility thisoffice is under. However you can see from mon-thly statements our true ConditionWe are making friends and enemies, but thereis not half enough elders in the field; please sendus a few score, Plenty room ^for^ good efficient men.See Bro. Fieldsted concerning efficiency of scan-dinavian elders; his views suit our condition well.If my son Albert would round up his shoulders heought to ^be^ called on a mission. My son BS could be very usefulto me and we need some one to begin to pick up a knowledgeof the clerical business of this office in view of Bro. Alstonsrelease next year, his health is very poor and we cannot 
 LATTER-DAY SAINTS',EUROPEAN PRINTING PUBLISHINGAND EMIGRATION OFFICE.42, Islington, Liverpool,188tell how long he will be able to endure his rhumatic af-flictions. This country does not agree with him, but he isuncomplaining and strickly business, and has provedhimself an active elder in the field. We releive himof the presidency of the L.pool Conference, calling himto labor in this office.Some of the elders and many of the saints aremuch exercised over your manifesto, but more, Ithink, in giving a sort of credence to the lying reportswhich are flooding the country concerning what was doneat your late conference. My testimony is, that all youracts are in perfect harmony with the revelations ofGod and I have talked and written, I believe, effectuallyon this subject. Astonishing how the world mourns overwhat they they are pleased to call a surrendering of principleson our part.Love to Prests.

 LATTER-DAY SAINTS',EUROPEAN PRINTING PUBLISHINGAND EMIGRATION OFFICE.42. Islington, Liverpool,Sept. 23rd 1890Prest WoodruffS. L. C. UtahDear Brother:My visits to London andLowestoft and attendance at the Conferences have been pleasantand the Lord is merciful unto us in this Country. At ourLondon Conference it ^is^ said that Jarman mustered his forces justbelow our hall but did not interefere with our comfort.The conference at Lowestoft was unusually well attended Iam informed, and there were about forty people present. One gentle-man who is investigating the principles of the Gospel came to meafter the evening meeting and thanked me for the informationhe had gained. Our affairs are at a low ebb, no persecution, butan indifference, hard to cope with, seems to have settled uponthe people. Lies are flying about and the most insideous comefrom our own mountain home. Apostates write that, the Govt. has stopped polygamy but the elders are living openly with young girlsmarriage or no marriage. I am forcebly impressed with the ideathat if an effort were made among the people, instructions sent to thepresidents of stakes and ^were to^ they operate with the Bishops Teachers etcenergetically, to have the people write to their friends throughout theBritish mission that good would be accomplished. The people are indiffer-ent in this land but they have an excellent example set them by theirfriends in Zion. I am satisfied that, quite a commotion would be madeamong those who have known us long if they could have faithfultestimonies from their absent friends. The Lord knows we need help fromevery good scource. 
 LATTER-DAY SAINTS',EUROPEAN PRINTING PUBLISHINGAND EMIGRATION OFFICE.42. Islington, Liverpool, 189Don't think me presumptious, brethren, in offering this suggestion, but^I^ have felt, quite strongly that it was the begening of the finish of this mission,of course I am anxious to have it last but I dont ^beleive^ God will endure perfectindifference ^on the part of the people^ for any great length of time. It seems to me there are thous-ands of people here who must receive the Gospel, good honest souls blindedby the craftiness of men, and my mind is already full of anxiety to knowhow to teach them. God help His elders, no human power can breakthe spell which evil has wrought upon the minds of the people.The greater part of the experienced elders of the mission willsoon be released to return home. I feel that we must pray andwork harder—more hours—to fill the vacancy which will befelt throughout the entire mission.It will be pretty hard upon the president of the mission ^to do^ but itseems actually necessary that he should attend every conference. Somuch needed instructions to the elders. They drop into curious nooksand corners and run in others ruts without giving the subject thought or dueConsederation; and the presthood meetings at these times as the most im-portant of all.My family is well.

John Taylorand the Twelve.Dear BreathrenI feel it will not be amiss towrite a few lines to informyou of our present good healthand prospects; Knowing the intresyou have in this mission. We areat our camp at this time abouttwo hundred souls. All enjoyinggood health and a plenty of workWe work all together as one familyand live as near a like as wecan. We are building a diningroom and are calculating toall eat at the same tablelike they do at Orderville. Butthe rumer has come here thatthe Twelve council otherwiseand the brethren do not feelso well united about eatingtogether as they did before and 
 a few words of council fromyou to us on the subject wouldbe thankfuly received no matterwheather it was to all eat at the one table or to continue to eatat our own tables as we areI believe your council would beunanimusly caried out.Bro. Lot Smith has aboutthe same number at hiscamp that we have. They eat at the big table andwork to gether to same as wedo. Bro. Allen has not quiteso many at his camp asis at either of the other campsBro. Lake as joined mycamp. They left their placeon account of sickness. Butare all well at present.We have just started our newthrasher to day and it is doingvery well. Bro. Foster fromOgdenthinks he never saw wheatturn out so well.

 Nov 1 [18]90B. YoungLiverpoolRcd Nov 20 [18]90In re MissionaryThe First PresidencyDear Brethren:I have sent a copy of this document to the presi-dents of the Conferences, for quite a number of them have told me that there were plenty of ^Young^ men in their neighborhood ^at home^ who were just the men for a mission. Brethren you can see that my intention is good and I hope this will meet your minds. I will forward the list Imake up from the reports, to you soonas possible. True we need men who will strike out into new fields, we ^have^ a very few in the mission who are determined to plow in old fields, and there are no saints to saupport that class. In some conferences I find that retaining drunken people in the church has, in one instance driven out a fairly good man and is baring respectable people who are favorably impressed with ^ the^ doctrines. When all means are exhausted and they persist in their drunkeness I have advised their being cut off. I find respecta-ble people in every Conference who are enquiring into the gospel. Just sunday in stockton on Tees strangers came in the evening ^to our meeting^ and one young man ^was heard to^ remarked ashe went out the door at the close, "I could sit and listen all night to such talk as that,"—the first principles of the Gospel.Your BrotherB.

Islington, Liverpool. Oct. 29th 1890.Prest. W. WoodruffSalt Lake City, Salt Lake County, Utah Territory|Salt Lake City Utah Dear Brother:Arrived home last night twelve oclock. It is cold and snowy in Scotland. Had an excellent Conference, Hall was crowded most of them strangers. Sub. Ed. "Glasgow Eve-news," present. He walked home with me after evening meeting. I received a note from him—Mr. Jas. Alex. Kilpat-rick—^this morning^ apologising for his "anti Mormon humour," "I mean no offense." He proffers to publish any corrections I wish to make in his report of our Conversation.I found the brethren in scotland anxiously looking to L.pool for more elders. The eight ^elders^ that came were not half enough for scotland alone, and I could spare them not one. They want thirty to fifty efficient elders. Openings are being made that must be improved, and we see them languish for the want of help. Most of the Conferences I have attended need assistance, elders who can help themselves and their families not feel distressed. Many of the brethren have said to me, there are plenty of Young ^men at home^ in our neighbourhood, who ought to Come out into the world on missions, and some have stated that, these efficient Young men were kept at home by the ward authorities. I am aware that many 
 remained at home to vote, but the enemy is fast re-leasing them and perhaps we can soon turn all of ^our^ attention to preaching the gospel. I have asked the brethren for lists of names and will send them to you;do not think me too officious in this act, the anxiety in me may plead for me.Good tourists have done a wonderful amount of good, and this class hunt up relatives and introduce the elders into places and families, not reached heretofore.Circumstances make it necessary to release Bro Jenk-ins from the scotish mission. Bro Brough is also released, this leaves but nine elders there. It seems to me that all the elders are going one way. Have some one advise me of elders being called and when they will leave. A few lines will post me.Where it is possible I have not suffered lies in the news papers to go unchalenged. Bro Carlisle and I are now acquainted with parties' connected with the leading papers here and ^also with^ Mr. Shearman American Con-sul and proffered ^to them^ information concerning our affairs that they need go astray no more. I am sending the starto these men and places, and have proffered to give them books if they will read them. Public libraries ought to be supplied, especially reading rooms so far as we can consistently, but I leave this to your direction.We are well and have the old place clean and comparatively cheerful looking. God bless you. Love to Prest Geo Q. C. & Jos. F S. and the brethren, ^In^ w^h^ich all join.Your Brother in Christ Brigham Young 
 P. S. Mr. Gibson informed me that a word from Bro Jack would have secured one free passage accross the ocean, as it was it cost me seventy five dollars.

 42 Islington L.pool Eng.Nov. 8th 1890President Wilford WoodruffSalt Lake City UtahDear Brother.Your favor of Oct. 20thcame to hand in due course of mail, I am rejoicedto receive this communication from you, it breathesa spirit that finds a congenial echo in my heartand stimulates me to emulate your example in thesegreat and important labors.I was glad to learn that, Bro. Teasdale accom-plished his journey to Deming so comfortably, andof his improved physical condition, as instanced byhis letter to me from that point.  It is I say, very satisfactoryfor he looked badly—emaciated and sorrowful when Isaw him last.  It almost gave one the blues to look in-to his sallow countenance, and not until he smiled &talked cheerfully could one eradicate, from his mind,the idea that, he was a much "enduring man."  God gowith him in his new field of labors.  His kind heart andfaithful labors have endeared him to the saints and theyspeak of him here as they spoke of him during my latevisit to Mexico.I am thankful for the prospects of more elderscoming to our assistance.  God give them courage topush out successfully into new fields, for they shall 
 have that blessed opportunity.Bro. Metz is an old friend of mine and I deem hima good man; a little impatient perhaps, sometimes, which wemay, in charity, call firmness and zeal.  I gladly extend thehand of a brother to the elders especially to Bro. Metz andhope to see them all in the near future.It will be a pleasure to release Bro. F. A. Brown to re-turn home and I believe Bro. Metz quite equal to the oc-casion.  Tho^se^ who study the Dutch language find itdifficult to acquire and young men who are appointedto this mission accomplish but little in the field withintwo years.  I have written to Bro. Brown to give mehis views respecting the prospects of the Holland mission,which report I write furni^s^h to you in due time.Prests. Cannon & Smith are perfectly familiar with thedifficulties elders need in the Holland mission,  I am ofthe opinion that we need laborers there now, however Iam willing to let the Lord dictate in this as in all othermatters.I will look anxiously for elders who are suitable togo to Turkey, but I can say to you now that, we needall the help we now have, and if you have in yourmind good efficient men who are natural linguist, 
 I believe they ought to be called and sent to the TurkishmissionWe have been discussing the propriety of putting ourMilleniael star before the public as other papers areadvertized. I can see no impropiity in doing it ifwe incur no additional expense.Bro. Teasdale informs me that you appropriateda sum of money to assist in furnishing tracks to theelders; they are quite liberal with their own means in thisgood work.  You know our condition financially, that is,without your assistance track distributing ^by the elders^ will cease orbe very much curtailed, and I am not clear but what thelatter maybe the proper thing ^for^ theym to do:Within the last month two of our brethern have been banishedfrom the Kingdom of Bavaria.  I am quite sure this would nothave happened if the principles of the gospel had been understood by those in authority, even in Bavaria. Our elders would find a greatadvantage if we were better known, in presenting the gospel ^to strangers^.  We havefriends through whom we might reach some of these parties if we caredto take that trouble.  I would much prefer to be represented by my friendsthen ^by^ my ^by^ enemies.Bro Carlisle and I have made the acquaintence ofmany ofthe newspaper men in this city and we feelsome confidence that they will treat us with some degreeof fairness.  Mr Ranesden has introduced us and hehas made a personal request that we be treated as gentlemen should be. 
 If Prest. Geo. Q. Cannon could make us a visit &introduce some of the elders to parties that he can approach,and I think John W. is favorably known to many in thiscountry, and with all the power we can muster we can reachmen that overtoss those scrubs who maltreat our elders;99 times in a hundred simply because they think our brethrenhave no friends.  I would like to show them to the contrary.The power is in men to do much of themselves and I amsure the Lord has given us a few good friends in this CountryI beleive it to be our duty to use every means in our powerto conteract the abominable lies which ^are^ spued out ofUnited States and find their way onto this island.Our policy is to get acquainted, offer to ans-wer respectable questions and give our reasons for thehope we have.  We have had many interesting conversationswith strangers.  I hear good reports from many partsof the mission.  Where it is practicable we try to crawl out ofthe back alleys and slums ^in our Conferences^ and hire halls in more respecta-ble quarters.  Where it can be done it pays in increase of congrega-tion.Brethren join me in love to you and the brethren asalso my family wish to be kindly remembered to youallYour Brother in ChristBrigham Young

Fred Stauffer.It is impossible for me to write the wayI feel about this matter to Bro. Staufferbecause I have not the authority to openup that mission as I think now it oughtto be done. However, the matter once beforeyou my mind will be at ease in thismatter as in all others wsheretofore. I foneof the First Presidency or Lorenzo Snow orany one of the Twelve or anyone else whomyou chosose could visit that country andformally open the mission and arrangefor the translation and publication ofour works as suggested by Bro. S. I amof the opinion that good could bedone there. And I am favorably impressed with the idea of placing ourselveson an equal footing before the lawwith other Christian denomination; and 
 to avoid complication that it should be donesoon as convenient, I have thought stronglyof having something of the kind here in thiscountry. It is understood that Christianministers are licensed and we are more liableto pursecution without license. I shall investi-gate the matter a little more carefully themI have been able to do and if the spiritconsents and you do not object obtainlicense for some one or more of the brethren.You will pardon my writing so oftenbut this time I am much exercised in spiritin relation to our missionary in Turkey.We are suffering from colds. The weatheris all we don't want, but ^we^ remain comparativelyhappy.The brethren join in love. Bro L. Pratt ishere ^arriving last night^ the death and sickness in his familyhave discomposed him to that extent ^and^ he could notwork in Paris. He has come to talk with me.  I don'tknow what his plans are but he feels badly.  Will com-fort ^him^ all I can.  Perhaps he wants to go home.

 B. YoungLATTER-DAY SAINTS',EUROPEAN PRINTING PUBLISHINGAND EMIGRATION OFFICE.42 Islington, Liverpool,Nov. 26th 1890Prest. Wilford Woodruff,Salt Lake City, Utah.Dear Brother:Encloseletter from Bro. Stauffer. It speaksfor its self; and more, it speaksmy mind in relation to the Turk-ish mission. It seems to me thata good work can be done thereand if that mission were properlyorganized, destricted and mademore familiar to our minds, I haveno reason to doubt there couldbe great good accomplished.The colonization scheme was talk-ed of in fathers day and is worthyof consideration in my opinion. 
 But of course I leave all those matters for your consider-ation. If I am correctly inform-ed Jan & Feb., earlier or a littlelater, ^either^ would be a good time tovisit the Holy land. I putout these ideas as they occurto me.I go to Ireland on Fridaynight to attend conference. Ex-pect to return monday. Welook for the first company ofElders to arrive on sat. or sun.We are in very good healthand business going on as usual.God bless and preserve youand overrule the acts of thosewolves.Your Brother in ChristBrigham Young 
 Prd Woodruff expressed himself honor'd in the privilege ofspeaking in this meeting. Referred to the subject of brethrenwanting to be ordained to higher priesthood &c. Agreed withBishop Hunter. Spoke of the early part of the church; for threeyears he acted as Teacher and preached, and built up branches. 
 Bro Woodruff said I have been edified this evening, andam interested in the building up of this Kingdom.Upon this quorum (the Bishops) rests great responsibility.I would like to know why this people go to our enemiesto make their purchases, and those who hold the priesthoodmay sink, and all this, right under the eyes of the first Presi-dency: Another is, why so many pretending to be saints,make promi[s]es, without caring whether they fulfil themor not, and why they run in debt, regardless of ever paying.I see such men in Israel, and am ashamed of it; Idespise such folly. Why in the name of almighty God,do not this people shake themselves free of these sins.I call upon you Bishops to help relieve Prest Young ofsome of these duties, and not let him be borne downwith these things. Use your influence to restrain theflood of wheat and Flour from going to these Gentile stores --we shall have a famine if it is not stopped. I keep a debtorand Creditor account with the Lord in my tithing, of allthat I produce, or consume as I would with a GentileStore, or any other; when can a man pay his tithing sowell, as at the time of raising, or harvesting.If every man kept a book account of his tithing and expensesthe Bishops would find it an easy matter to settle theTithing with them. Prune your quorums, it is better toprune them than that the Tree should rot. If israel donot do their duty, we shall lose the Presidency. May thespirit and power of the priesthood rest upon the Bishops,for upon them rests great responsibility. May Godbless you with every blessing you need &c 
 Wilford Woodruff / said that what he had heard to nightwas good, for we as a people have got to reform, especiallywith regard to our commercial matters, was glad tosee such a willingness manifested towards relievingthe Presidency of some of their burthens; he reminded theBishops, that many were in the habit of taking their Grainto the Gentiles and trade it off he hoped they would put acheck to it as far as they could; he would rejoice to seethe day when all Bishops, Missionaries, Presidents, andothers will be so far living their religion, and walking up totheir duties, that the President could come into their meetings and rejoice in their midst. Spoke of the n^e^cessity ofeach one who holds the priesthood acting in their calling,and not to wait for President Young to put his hand uponeverything that needs correction, he felt to say to Bishop Hunter,his Counsellors, and the Bishops generally May God blessand speed you, he then spoke of the reformation as beinga straightforward and natural thing, there was no mysteryabout it, but consisted in leaving off every evil practise, anddoing better, let us honour every man in his calling, andwherever any man in authority can exercise the spirit ofmercy it is good, though it is neccessary to use the rodat times. May God bless you all Amen.The following "Ordinations" were attended to 
 Wilford Woodruff, desired the Bishops and other authoritiesto lay their hands upon the brain as far as they can, andpay especial regard to the remarks of Elder Orson Hyde,he then appealed to the Missionaries who had partly wakedand desired them to get more of the fire of the Holy Ghost; speakingof the lessor priesthood, he said show me a man who had magnifiedand honored his calling as a Teacher, and I will show you a mightyman in Israel, there had been such a rush into the quorums ofthe Seventy's and High Priests, that they had become as black asmidnight; he rebuked the practise of taking every littledifficulty to the President instead of having them settled by thePriests Teachers &c and he with the rest of the Twelve intendedto be after every Quorum, until the fire of God should burn so hot,as to consume all the iniquity that lurks in our midst. 
 Wilford Woodruff was pleased with L. W. Hardy's introducing theBook of Mormon &c into the schools, spoke of his own indefaticable exertions about a year ago, to wake up an interest among thechildren in every ward by holding evening meetings with thembut owing to the deadness of the parents it was an uphill workand almost labour in vain, speaking of the priesthood he saidBp Hunter was the head of this Bishopric, and he often feltweighed down with something on his mind which he wantedthe Bishops to relieve him of, by carrying out his instructions, refered to the Israelites who had gone so far from God, that they could donothing without a Law, even to govern them in the smallest things,such was the condition of the world at the present time, spoke ofthe extent of the priesthood that the Bishops exercised amongthe people, which was sufficient for almost everything that trans-pired, if the people will do right.He deprecated the practise of farmers bringing young sheep to theButchers for slaughter, and desired the Bishops to check it, forthe raising of Wool, Hemp, and Flax was of too much importanceto be trifled with, for we may rest assured, that we shall be underthe necessity of sustaining ourselves, and that very soon.contrasted the law of the priesthood with the laws of the Territory, byone of which everybody had to be governed. 
 Wilford Woodruff, suggested as a preventive against thebrethren getting behind hand in their tithing, viz for everyone to pay it at the very time of raising, and in every kindthat is raised, he also suggested that Bro McRae be appointeda Bishop of the 11th Ward, with the view of relieving the excess-ive burthen now upon the shoulders of Bro Hardy. 
 Wilford Woodruff backed up the sentiments just advanced, he feltthat it was the duty of the Bishops to attend to their temporal duties,which was the leading ideas of Bp Hunter, the responsibilitiesresting of the Bishops are great, especially as so many of thebrethren are now taking more wives, they will require at yourhands much council on the principle of obedience, for unlesschildren are taught to be obedient to their parents, they will become poor Husbands and wives. It was the duty of theTwelve that are at home to follow the example of Prest B Youngto walk into the different quorums to give instruction, and seehow things are going on, for it was not only their right, but Godrequired it at their hands; he wished the Bishops would holdon to the members of the quorums of Priests, Teachers and Deaconsthat are good for anything, and not allow them to go off intothe seventys until they have magnified their calling in the lessorpriesthood, but he deprecated a contentious spirit betweenthe different quorums, as to which was the greatest, this had beena bone of contention since the beginning, and ought to be put astop to, after giving some valuable instruction on this subject, heprayed that God would bless us all. 
 Wilford Woodruff, stated there was a vacancy in the history of thechurch, for at least 3 months immediately after the death of Joseph,and if any present can furnish anything either from memory or Journalthat transpired during that period, will please forward the same to theHistorians Office, referring to the reformation, he said the Lord had forgivenus for what was past, but after rebaptism, should the people again sin inIsrael, the Law would undoubtedly be put in force, for it was impossiblethat people could henceforth sin with impunity, for he well knew that PrestYoung would never appear before us again in that merciful consideration,which he has done of late, refered to the great blessings that belonged tothe lessor priesthood, especially the ministration of angels, and stronglydeprecated a spirit of contention that had been more or less manifestfor the last 14 years, and recommended each one to realize the responsibility that rested on them, let their calling be what it may, mentionedthe power of the priesthood that was manifest in several instancesin Nauvou, where the sick and dying lay about in all directions, andJoseph rose up and shook himself, and commanded every one of themto rise up, and they were healed forthwith, he also spoke of other instanceswhere the wicked were Kept at Bay, and were made to Quake and fearat the words of the Lord through his Servants Joseph, Brigham, and DavidPatten, spoke of the clouds that were gathering ahead of us, and the necessityof each one being in readiness both Temporally and Spiritually, that we mayhave the blessing and approbation of God. 
 W. Woodruff, felt interested, he had seen a reformation in everymeeting he now attended, there was a different spirit andatmosphere altogether, to what there was last year, spoke ofthe principle of submission to the priesthood, that existed herein this King dom, which could not be found among anypeople on the face of the earth, he refered to the example thatthe Saviour set us in this thing, by patiently enduring the mostabject poverty and deprivation of every kind, surrounded by bitterpersecution &c all in obedience to the priesthood, there was not oneout of a thousand in this Territory that would refuse to obey thecouncil of President Young, and while we as a people continueto take this course, we shall be surrounded with blessing allthe time, the world knows nothing of this principle, but ratherindulge in a disposition to devour each other, he then spoke ofthe importance of the twelve having the same spirit as was in PresidentYoung, and as He could not be personally present in the variousquorums, wherever the twelve went, they should be able to do justas He would, were he present, after giving much instruction andencouragement, he prayed that God would bless them.D. Fulmer, was delighted to contemplate the change that had beenbrought about among the saints, especially in the absence of alldifficulties, for he had not heard of one either with the Bishopsor any one else for a long time, whereas some time ago, notonly the Bishops, but the High Council and the Presidency hadpiles of them. 
 Wilford Woodruff, believed the saints would have just as much to doin this world, and in that which is to come, as ever we are capableof performing, and so far from supposing we had come here to rest,his past experience had thoroughly converted him from that doctrine,he spoke of the importance of every Elder in Israel keeping a Journalor History of things as the transpire, at the first organization of theTwelve apostles, "The Prophet Joseph said he had suffered much sorrowof heart, for not writing or caused to be written the dealings of God withthis people, he said also, whenever you Quorums meet, be sure you alwayshave a clerk to record all your decisions, if you don't, the Lord will be angrywith you" Bro. Woodruff remarked that he had himself kept a Journalfor the last 24 years, and daily recorded his doings and whereabouts,and much of what he had heard from the Prophet Joseph and theTwelve, he then strongly urged on the Bishops to keep an account ofhow they spend their time, which would form an important History inGenerations to come &c 
 Bro W. Woodruff, hoped the people wouldtake care of what sheep we now have, there had beensuch neglect heretofore, and consequently great loss anddestruction which had made his heart sick he hoped theBrethren would take more care of them, on Tithing hesaid he had been in the Storehouse and seen the immen[se]quantity of Grain, and if a few more Teams came in [,] thebins would run over. 
 Elder Woodruff spoke of the importance ofBishops watching especially at the present time as therewere many gathering between the Mountains to go East.there had been a span of Horses taken away last nightat the West Mountain, the Lariats had been cut and theAnimals were missing, he exhorted the Bishops to watchand for them to set others to watch also, and as far as possible dont allow any one to go away in debt either tothe Emigrating Fund or any one else for it was nothingbut right that people should pay their debts before theyare allowed to go away. 
 Elder Wilford sustained the remarks and sentiments of Prest Young, and was glad that the time hadcome, when the Elders on missions would be sustained with funds by the people here instead of the poor saints abroad.

 Wilford Woodruff, being present, remarked, that as the time for holdingour Annual Fair was at hand, he wished the Bps of the several wardsto appoint persons to deliver public addresses in each ward, on the subjectof holding the Fair, and encourage the people to bring specimens of theirworkmanship in cloth, and other products of their skill and industry. 
 Elder Wilford Wilford, entirely coincided with the previous remarks— we have men in our midst who would sell the Kingdom, their Houses, Farms,anything else that will strengthen the hands of our enemies, let us thereforeone and all walk up to our duties, that are now required of us, and backup our Bishops, the Mayor &c 
 Elder W. Woodruff said many of our children were being sent tooutside schools, who deny new revelation, and many other principlesof the Gospel, he opposed it in his feelings, and would not do it himself.We ought to sustain our own Teachers who are in full faith and fellowship with us.There are many dead branches which must sooner or later be cut off, for they neither goto meeting nor pray, but can swear, get drunk &c.The Lessor Priesthood should be organized in every ward to act in their lot and place,no man should feel himself so high as to refuse to act in that priesthood.He then spoke of the respect that Joseph Smith the Prophet entertained towards the Teachersand submitted to a severe criticism by the first Teacher that ever entered his house.The Bishops held very responsible positions, and he felt to encourage them to be faithfulfor God required it at their hands.If we only become united as a people before God, no power can ever harm the anointed ofGod. We have no time to waste, but let us be up and do our duty, act as Patriarchsover our own house, for it was painful to see our young people growing up in Infidelity,and give themselves up to all kinds of wickedness.We had more faith in the prayers of ten righteous men, than in all the big gunson the face of the earth, Prest Young and George Q Cannon were instances ofdeliverance, as the result of faith and prayer. 
 Elder W. Woodruff was pleased with the representation of the Bishops to night, the blessing of the Lord will rest upon the Missionaries who go in the right spirit.He suggested that a Surgeon and Midwife should go along, and that all the company operate in one common interest, carrying out the principle of the united order; and work for each other. 
 Randolph Rich Co May 31, 1874Dear Brother BrighamI write to say that we have organized Evry Branch in this Stake of Zion in the United Order except one, had a good time, much of the Spirit of the Lord with us. Most of the people receive it.My object in writing at this time is to say to you that Brothers Rich, Budge, & myself visited Soda Spring Branch, & preached to what people there was there of the Saints but did not organize Because the president & most of the leading men of that Branch of the Church were gone from home, butht most of those who were present voted to join the order, and on[e] that is in your jurisdiction I thought perhaps you could visit them and organize them by sending an appointment so they could be at home. We have held 23 Meeting and organize 11 Branches of the United Order. I expect to start for Salt Lake City in few days, shall Meet the Saints at Almy on my return Your Brother in the Gospel W.

I beleive this is a healthy beality [end of upside-down text]LATTER-DAY SAINTS',EUROPEAN PRINTING PUBLISHINGAND EMIGRATION OFFICE42 Islington, LiverpoolApl. 6th  1892Prest Wilford Woodruff & CounsellorsSalt Lake City, Utah.Dear Brethern:I am thankful for the privilege ofwriting to you on this auspicious day. Deeply grateful am I for the tidings of what will transfirein our loved mountain home on this the sixty second anniversary of the establishing of the churchof Christ in the earth. God is merciful to His people, we live to behold a day that I did notwhope would transpire within the limited span allotted time on earth.Brethren of the Presidency and Twelve, I join you in spirit this day duringyour celebratiansand offerings unto God. When a boy, I rejoiced during the services oflaying the capstone on the Temple at Nauvoo; as a man, I worship the Being who hasbrought about this great triumph to the saints; here is demonstrated their skill perseveranceand industry, a blended monument of the zeal and integority of the people, a thing of beauty anda joy forever. Your own feelings will tell you how joyfully I would join you ^on^ this occasion, but under the circumstances I could not hope or expect to attend these celebrationswhich precede the most complete dedicatory cerimonies which I trust are not far distantAlthough far distant from the stiring scenes which have transried among youduring the last ninteen months, yet I have been with you in spirit and sustained^you^ with my prayers before the Lord. It was not difficult for one to understand the various moverwhich have been made and I approved of the "Manifesto" proclamations etc which have ^been^insued by the Presidency and Twelve, unto the saints. In all these mutatitions but oncehave I felt the solid ground move under my feet, and that was long ago when the eldersmaintained that the "manifesto" not only abrogated all plural marriages but ^also^ ad-vised the brethren to break up their plural families and discard, seperate from, ignorethose women who were wives anterior to the ^passage of those^ vile ^ants^ polygamy laws, as well as later marriages. 
 I have laid these matters away, and concluded it will be time enough across thatbridge when I reach it. The business which devolves upon me with furnish awhileemployment while I am in this land and I trust in God for all future exigencies.Perhaps more will be known in relation to the sitriahan after the anvesty is pro-I caimed, than is dreamed of now. One thing, in relations to my present feelings,is quite clear. I would rather live without all my wives, entirely seper-ate from them, than to live exclusively with any one of my wives. While Ihold these feelings yet they are now and with Gods help my whole beingshall be subject to "thus saith the Lord".I am but poorly in health, and in fact all of the brethrenin the office are loosing their energy, but we are still able to keep thingsmoving and I am improving so are the brethren I believe. Summer is comingand we all feel a sensation of returning health. I am quite sure the climatehere is changing for the worse and occasionally Englishmen express themselvesas being & disgusted with the climate.We left New Brighton and now occupy a house near Princes Parkat a rent of two hundred dollars per year. Have used some money to purchasenecessary articles for keeping house. There were a few things at 42 we could use butmost everything there would not bear transportion, too old and broken. Will ^soon^ sendthe amount used and if you do not choose to allow it I will pay it.Of course I do not know how you are pleased with our administrationbut I am well pleased with the way we are getting on.Please send us a good writer for sub-editor and a first class printer. Weare dependant on Union people, — Mr. Davis having left us — and these are hardmen who calculate to get pay without much work. Bro. Anderson ought tobe released as early as September ^if not before^ and the man who suceeds him ought to haveexperience in the field before he comes into the office.God bless you my dear brethren with love in which thebrethren and Mrs. Y. joinYour Bro in ChristBrigham Young

Osmond to repace Bro. Anderson is impracticable forthe following reasons. Bro. Osmond was here on mission two yearsfrom 1884 to 1886. He came here year last Jan. it will be two yearsnext Jan. His health is much impared, His financial conditionat home is embarassing, and under these circumstances I havearranged to release him in the near future. I presume you willlook upon his case as I do. He is willing to stay, but another winter herewould prove fatal to him ^I believe^; within the last three months he has been at deathsdoor; he now presides in London.I have spent some forty pounds for house furniture the bills formost of it I forward you have no bills for the ten pounds Furniture etcat 42 would not bear transportation the brethren use that which we left thatwhich is good for anything. I will pay these bills should ^you^ intimate it ismy business to do so. Have taken my family notraveling to improve the healthof my wife and children who have been seriously afflicted at times, hencethe great expense to me. Bro. Anderson is gradually failing in health soare most of the brethren who sleep at 42; business makes it necessary forthem to do so. Printers earn their wages by shirking, must be watched closely.My brethren & family join in loveYour Bro in Christ.Brigham Young

Wilford WoodruffSalt Lake City, Utah.Dear Brother: Your favor Feb. 15thcame to hand and was perused with uncommoninterest and I will answer you according to the lightthat is in me. First, we thank you for your kind invi-tation to attend the aniversary of your birth day Heavenhas favored you and I thank God you are recoveredfrom your recent illness and for the presservation of yourlife to comfort the saints and your family. I will sug-gest that your next invatation anti date your birthday, time enough ^for us^ to joni you, especially should youconsider our presence necessary—rather desiriable.Curiosity I believe is the mainspring that has broughtstrangers to our meetings, and I believe that, curiosity iswaning; for all over the mission with about three exceptionsthe people feel in the districts where our people elders labor, thata mormon elder, with his gospel is a nuissance. Thepeople do not want the gospel and while we do batptizea few—not one proselyte to each elder in the year. Still itis a fact that, the elders meet with but little but abuse.We are warning the people and ^doing^ but little else. I have feltto put a force in here—this nation, that, the people will be leftwithout excuse, I have found not one case where the distributionof tracts has brought one soul to our meetings or into the Church. 
 So far as emigration matters are concerned, the english por-tion is rather insignificant, what ^emigrants^ there are could ship atsouthhampton joining german steamer at that point whichcould bring our Scandinavian emigration better thanthere present method of Conveyance, in my opinion. But thisis a matter that with your permission I will examine into moreparticularly, not with a view of doing anything but for informationpending future events.President Woodruff, this mission is a dead beet so faras proselyting is concerned. My whole anxiety has been to warnthe people, outside of that, the mission is shurnken to an insig-nificant compass. We hire halls and but few come; I am afraidthere is culpable neglect on the part of the saints, many have tobe nursed and ^for the elder^ to leave them—the saints—to break new ground manybecome cold indifferent and must have a frequent application ofgospel warming pan, and I have known cases when it was impossi-ble to resussitate them. Our batteries are too light metal, the Lordcan turn their ^the peoples^ indifference to interest, but we cannot.Prest Saml Thurman, London, reports some interest among strangersthere but it is comparatively little; one of the elders had been laboringfor two months and thought if he could be left in that vicinity for a few weekslonger he could make one or two converts. We have to contend withsupreme indifference of the people, or abuse. Your son-in-law is aboutcorrect. I am not discouraged and we have many conferences toattend within the next two months.I could give you more detailes but these are facts as Iunderstand the situation.God bless you with long life future—Love to brethren, in whichthe brethren join.

 OFFICE OFThe First Presidencyof theChurch of Jesus ChristofLatter-day Saints.P.O. Box B. Salt Lake City, Utah May 10, 1895.Elder Brigham Young,City.Dear Brother:The changed conditions in the Church educational systemhave rendered it desirable, in the opinion of the First Presidency and themembers of the Boards of Young University and the Latter-day SaintsCollege, of Salt Lake City, that these two institutions of learning shouldbe consolidated, and to preserve the name of President Brigham Young itis suggested that the new establishment be known as Young Institute. Itis thought the best interests of the school will be subserved by greatlyreducing the number of members of the Board (say to seven); as at presentit is next to impossible to get together a sufficient number to form aquorum. Under these circumstances it will be necessary for the greaterportion of the members of the board of Young University to resign. Weourselves have each of us already tendered our resignation, and we writethis to you to ask if you have any objections to resigning also. If youhave not, will you be so kind as to forward your resignation to thePresident of the Board of Young University—George Q. Cannon.Respectfully your Brethren,Wilford WoodruffGeo. Q. CannonJos. F.

 PRESIDENT'S OFFICE, Salt Lake City, Utah, June 29, 1888.Elder Brigham Young,Dear Brother:Your brief letter of the 17th has just reached me. I am not surprised to hear from you of the fatigue and lameness which you feel in consequence of the hard trip that you have taken. You have passed through a very rough country, and if you have had many miles of road to make you have had a tedious time.There is nothing particularly new since I last wrote to you, excepting that we are still progressing somewhat in our attempt to aef-fect a settlement of the Church suit; but as we progress the hunger of the officers seems to increase. A comparison was made to us by a man not of our faith that they reminded him of wolves sitting and licking their chops, waiting for their prey. Their eyes glare at the mention of property with the same eagerness and hunger that wild animals have when they scent their prey. But the Council has decided that we had better do everything we can to effect a settlement, even if it takes all the property that they claim. We would liked you to have been with us to have given us your views upon the subject. It wis with great reluctance that we do this—the same reluctance with which we have yielded our property in days past, when armed mobs have stood 
 around and driven us from our homes and taken possession of that which the Lord had given to us. But this will stop these painful proceedings before the Examiner, and will perhaps be the means of saving our temples and meeting-houses and sacred places from direct attacks, if it does not savie them entirely; at least, we hope so. The case of course, will be carried up to the court of last resort for its decision.My health and the health of the brethren general-ly is good. Brother Grant has not been well; but has been able to attend our two last Councils. Yourself and Brothers Thatcher and Teasdale are the only ones absent now of the Quorum. With love and praying the Lord to bless you and preserve you from every evil, in which Brothers Geo. Q. and Jos. F. join,I remain,Your Brother, Wilford Woodruff

 L. D. S. Historian's Office,P. O. Box 321,Salt Lake City, Utah, May 3 1887Dear Brother BrighamYour Welcome Letter of April 19 is received and I was very glad to hear from you. I was vary much pleased with the spirit of your Letter Now with regard to Brother Tenney, I will say I did not know that He had any Appointment by any badyOne Except the Mission I gave him to the Zonies, Lagoonies, Islata &c. while I was in that country He done Nothing in the Mission after the Rail Roading commenced And after He came out of prision and broke down financia-lly and in spirit & health We could not Expect him to do much at Missionary Work at present But in coresspondence with the presidency we have thought it Wisdom to Esstablish a mission with the Maricopas, Pemos Papagoes and then reach the Yaquis but not to begin with theYaquis first. And having travelled with Tenney and knowing that He could preach Well in spanish I thought He would make one good hand with a company of 4 or 6 as the case might be to Engage in that Mission He might not be a suitable man to Lead in it I have written to him upon the subject and it would Meet his Mind to Engage 
 in that Mission. I did not know that he had Labored among the Navajos or had a Mission to them. He helped Baptise 115 Zunies and Labored some 6 months with the Islata I am Satisfied Brother Brigham that as the Gentilses are so fast and so thoroughly rejecting the Gospel that it is our Duty to more thorou-ghly commence to Esstablish MissionaryStations among the Lamanite throughout this Western world. Now of course I do not know what instructions you have received from the presidency concerning your Mission or to what Extent But as the Navajos Join on to those Northern tribes I should think that you ought to have the oversight of the Oribas Moquis, Zonies Lagoonies & Islata. The Islataare a very rich intelegant indostrios people, ther City Numbers 3 or 4000 They are 12 Miles below Albukirke you have probably been there They have vary rich vineyards orchards & fields. John King was ther old patriark when we was there, We held 2 Meetings with the Lagoonies and the Govorner & spiritual Adviser went with us to Islata and staid with us while there, where We Returned they went up the River but said they would be back as soon as we did, but they did not come If they had been there we should have baptized the whole village and there has been No preaching there since to my knowledge 
 L. D. S. Historian's Office,P. O. Box 321,Salt Lake City, Utah, May 3, 1887[written in pink ink] I will now say according to my view it is of but Little use to baptize the Lamanites and then go and Leave them without any guideThey should be organized and some judicious Elder apointed to Labor with them and teach them both by precept & Example, before they can be qualified to Live as Latter Day Saints, and we shall have to adopt that policy Hereafter as far as we can[written in black ink] I gave Brother Milton S. Ray a Mission a good while ago to preach to the Maricopas and Esstablish a school among them which He has done and I understand thye the children are learning fast. Brother Ray is now in Salt Lake City He took his wife there because she was sick his Location is in Messa City but it is so hot there the Sisters can hardly Live. My Daughter Bell Moses has come home to her Mothers in Smithfield with her children she is almost Dead with the Heat. Brother Moses is calculating to sell out and come North in consequence of the Sickness of his Wife If we Esstablished a Mission among these South-ern tribes I did not Expect they would get at 
 ^it^ untill fall, and my view was for them to commence with the Maricopas and Pimas located on Salt River and work South through the Papagoes and others untill they Reach the Yaquis. It will be a good while before they would reach the Yaquis. Of course we want all the Wisdom we can get to carry out these Missions Missions among the Lamanites. I admire your views very much to get the permit approbations & all the assistance we can from the Authorities of Mexico, to assist us in so imporant an undertaking. Of course we want Men who can speak spanish to Engage in those Missions There should not be less that 4 to go upon that Mission so when they seperate there can be two together[written in pink ink] I had a few names in my Mind which Ithink I sent to president Taylor for his Approval ^Big^ T. W. Brookbank A M Tenney, J P J Christofferson one Stewart at Kanab And a young Man whose Mother a Widow ^Greer^ at the Meadows I have not the two last names before me[written in black ink] I would Like your views Brother Brigham in this Matter what would you think of Brother Brookbank as a Leader and Tenney & Stewart as counsellers I am Well acquainted with Brother Brookbank I should think He would make a good Leader[written in pink ink] I was sorry the Mexicans killed Cajeme the Yaqui Chief[written in black ink] Have the Mexicans taken possession of ther Land 
 L. D. S. Historian's Office,P. O. Box 321,Salt Lake City, Utah, May 3 1887Now I have got through speaking of the mission I will write of sumthing Els. Of course I wouldwould be pleased to be With you and take a Hunt in the Mountains, but I Expect I would tire out rather rather sooner than I used to. I am in good health & spirits, but I got tired out in half a days tramp I am today where you left me. I take the same boat and go & get and get a few ducks in the season but now I ownly ketch a string of club fish, in the same pond the club weigh from 6 to 20 oz each net may go over 1 lb but they are very good Eating for a change, and quite plenty in the season I have seen half a Barrel in 10 foot square. I spend most of my time in my Room in my Room reading & writing or ratherscribling as you will learn before you get through reading this Letter. I dont pretend to write so any body can read it without the gift of translation. But I can read it as well as I can Capt Hoopers. As I cannot preach in public I go to the Temple and do what I can for my Dead. I met 125 friends, in the Temple on the 2 March, the day following my birth day, 73, 
 of them went through for my Dead. I spoke to them a short time But Left the city the same Evening, this is the first time but one that I have spoken to any company in the capacity of a meeting for 28 Months I was sealed for 73 couple of Dead friends, while there which makes 3000 souls of Dead friends while I have had Baptized Endowed & sealings, for, and have 265 more to attend to to finish up my Record, which I hope I may Live to Accomplish wile it I received a good Letter from Moses Thatcher giving me a whole history of all the Mexican Mission which was very interesting to me[written in pink ink] The amount of Land bought was 10000 Acres at Diaz48000 [Acres at] Juarez 75000 A Carralis133000 Acres totalAlso $76000. dollar worth of Machinery in operation A 25 Horse power, Engine with saw, shingle & Lath Mill, plaining &c. The whole History was interesting to me. He was in Utah though but few knew it, I got a good letter from Lorenzo Snow was going to winkapie camp to settle some difficulty in his tribe. I got a good Letter from Joseph F. Smith He got Well again in a great Measure.[written in black ink] Concerning affairs in Utah I Expect you get most of the News from the papers. There is quite Rejoicing over the Removal of Dixon & Brother Jaques said in one Letter that Zane had resigned but I have

Salt Lake City, Utah, Feb. 5, 1896.Elder Brigham Young,Dear Brother:Inasmuch as you have been appointed toattend the San Juan Stake Conference, which will be held at Bluff on the22nd and 23rd insts., we wish you to consider the following items ofbusiness while there. You may find it necessary to release the Presi-dent of the Stake and Bishop Neilsen of the Bluff Ward, in consequenceof their advanced age and growing infirmities. We suggest Platt D.Lyman for President and Cumen Jones for Bishop should you find it agree-able and proper to make such changes. Of course you will consult thefeelings of the people in these matters. We understand the spiritualand temporal prosperity of the Stake require a change in the adminis-trative officers.The Burnham Ward should have another Bishop. Bro. LutherBurnham seems to consider the labor of presiding in that ward too oner-ous in his present straitened circumstances, and that a more active manwould suit the people better. If you find this to be the case, makesuch changes as may be necessary for the spiritual and temporal prosper-ity of the people of that ward.The Jensen case ought to be handled with care. If, on inves-tigation, you find that Bro. Jensen of Mancos was justified in notattending the San Juan Conference recently held at Fruitland, continueyour investigation of the case, which he (Jensen) submitted to us, atthe Stake Conference which will be held at Bluff on the 22nd and 23rdinsts. 
 Use every precaution compatable with your duty, to save thefeelings of Prest. Hammond and also the feelings of all those brethrenwho are in trouble and have to meet these charges and have judgmentpassed upon them.God bless you.Your Brethren,Wilford WoodruffGeo. Q. CannonJos. F. Smith

We commend yourfaith, and with you we believe that the promises made in her behalf willbe fulfilled. You have our sincere and constant prayers that it may beso. In this feeling we are encouraged by the receipt of your telegramon President Woodruff's birthday in which you state that she is improv-ing. We trust your own health remains good. Ours, we are happy to say,is excellent.The weather here has changed from winter tospring—dry, clear and pleasant. This gives us hope that it is the sameon the coast, and if so, is more propitious for Sister Lizzie's recoveryas well as more agreeable for yourself. The early advent of spring inthis region has, however, given cause for considerable apprehension of ascarcity of water next season, as the snow in the mountains surroundingthis and neighboring valleys is said to be far below the average.We had a call yesterday from Mr. Kraft who gaveus a full particulars concerning your situation and the condition of Sister Young, and he spoke of your devoted attentions to her in hersickness. He told us also of the faith which you and your daughterKatie, his wife, have in relation to Sister Young's recovery. We appre- 
 ciate his kindness in calling upojn us as we were quite desirous tolearn all we could about you.Prest. Smith has been east for the last two weeks, he is ex-pected back Monday afternoon.Of course you will have learned of the death of James T.

CannonJoseph F. SmithS. L. C. Utah U. S. A.Dear Brethren:Enclose youa letter from Prests. T. Metz who wishes to be releived, person-ally, and have the Netherlands Mission account cred-ited the amount of emigration money paid forthe parties named viz £ 30. 9. 6. His proposition to havethe note transfered to me or to this office is altogetherinadmissable but as Bro. M. felt positive that the elderwould pay it, and no doubt Bro Brown is equally assanguine, tho' I have had my faith much shaken un-der simelar circumstances, perhaps you will do something.The Netherlands Mission needs assistance—moreelders. I found Prest. Metz in very poor health and hehad but two efficient assistants Bros A. Farrell and Hyde. Bro. Subert is not advanced in the langu-age far enough to render much help for the present.The labors of these brethren are ^at^ Rotterdam & Amsterdam, withtheir hands full, indeed, a portion of the time they are badlyover worked. Neither Bro. Farrell nor Hyde are in robust health. Prest. Metz is quite feeble; poor food, cold weather,exposure and over work have made a great change in 
 rugged man. Unless the genial climate of Arizona restoreshim to his normal condition of health I doubt his livingvery long. I was more surprised to find him in this con-dition because I have known him as arough and readypontuismans able to endure every hardship.Bro. Farrell understands the business of the Missionand speaks the language very well. Bro. Metz has all confi-dence in him and feels sanguine that he is competent to suc-ceed him in the presidency of the Dutch or, rather Nether-land Mission. Bro F is not more than 24 years old buthas much experience at home and abrodt. However thethe Mission must have a presedents ^perhaps you can send a man.^ Bro. Metz must bereleased and will part sometime in November. Thesaints love him and they also love the other elders, Bro. M. has done a good work.More elders are needed. There are but four elders at presentin the Netherland Mission and there ought to be not less than twelve. Brussels 2; Antwerp two; Liege two; Hollandsix. From the best information I can obtain and good work canbe done in that country if help is given them.The British Mission still lives but the pulse is feeble. TurkishMission is struggling for existence. The brethren are encouraged by the Spirit, not externals. With a little trouble I could meet the Turk-ish Minister, it is a great thing in the world to be known, and Ihave noticed a revolution in the feelings of educated classes inthis country.My health is good. My daughter ^Katie^ cables she will come, she is in adistressing condition and comes for a surgical operation, I will meet her in N. Y.which I trust you will approve of.Love to the Brethren; God bless you.Your Bro in Christ.Brigham Young.

 LATTER-DAY SAINTS', EUROPEAN PRINTING PUBLISHING AND EMIGRATION OFFICE.42, Islington, Liverpool.May 24 1895President Wilford WoodruffDear BrotherOn May 21st there were four Scandinavian Missionaries returned to Utah and charged to the Church account, one of them was Niels Peter Larsen of Pleasant Grove Utah County, whom President E H Anderson of the Scandinavian Mission reported on his list as a returning Missionary, but in his letter of advice to us he says. "Elder Niels P Larsen came here last summer on genealogicalbusiness but was so successful among hisfriends that he remained to assist in themission where he has done a good work among his relatives and acquaintances. If you can pass him he will feel well over it, but if not why he will either pay or give you a note" and as we had not authority to pass him free, we took the enclosed note for £14.17.6, which is just the cost to this office of sending him from Copenhagen to Utah, and told him if any other arrangements were made they would have to be made with you.Yours trulyBrigham YoungJCCP S we have not passed the amount of note through our books

 Deseret July 11th 1892President. W. WoodruffDear BrotherI received a communicationfrom you on Friday Lastand have noted its contentsand must say in replythat in the main theLetter of Brother Wood& President Young arecorrect that is thecharges against mein the first place. I hadthe chapel in BirminghamRepaired up as it was goingto ruin and thought wecould raise money enoughin the Birmingham Conferenceto pay the bill but I wasmistaken, I raised what I could and told BrotherG. T. Spokes I would be-come responsible forthe Balance due ten poundsmy self as I felt whenI returned home to laythe matter before the 
 Bishop and Counsel alsothe Teachers Qourumand I thought it would be easy to raise the moneybut I was mistakenSome have promised tohelp and I have waitedmonth after month inthe vain hope that manywould assist meI also owe Mr Dean thetailor for one suit ofClothes. 4. Pounds hewas very kind and mademe the offer and saidtime and again that Ineed be in no hurryI told him as soon asI returned home I wouldsend the money as soon as I could get straightenedaround. I also owe BrotherGrant Z Bullock 3. dollarsand my Sister ten poundsall of which I promisedto return at an early datebut the money belongingto the Spendloves ^Boy^ is not 
 quite correct, he gave mea check for ten dollarsthis Spring early and toldone to send it to hisfolks it was some timebefore I could get a ten dollar bill for itsome time after he askedme if I had sent it. Itold him no as I hadonly just got it changedbut would, he went offwith a sheep herd andafter he left I concludedto keep the money untillthe boy came back to deseretand let him send it him-self then if there was anyloss it would not by myfault; he came here inJune and I wrote aletter to his folk, withhim put in the moneyand had him mail ithimself, and I presumehis parents had the moneywhen President Woodwrote to President Young 
 Now for all the Excuse I have to offer, when I leftEngland I thought I couldgo to work on my returnhome and raise the moneyand send it back ina very short time, andI delayed writing thinkingI would have the cash tosend very soon, I beganwork the first week onmy return home in theshop I am a Blacksmithby trade, there was somefreighting going on ^to^ theFish Spring Mines Idone lots of work infixing up teams and soonhad over $100.00 owingme but I could not getthe money they put on more teams to haul Iworked hard and aboutthe last of October theythe owners of the Minessoop stoped the teamesfrom hauling and theboys were all in debt 
 for wagons and otherthings and the storestook all there pay andI have not got mymoney yet but havewaited and expected itevery month and failedto get it, I sold a mareharness & Wagon this springfor $150.00 trusting toget the money to pay offthose debts but havenot been able to collecta dollar in casth onit as yet, I have offereda mare and colt valuedat $20000. for $10000 inorder to pay the debt. I have also offered to sellmy water stock in theDeseret Irrigation Companyfor 50 cents on the dollarand cannot do so. I haveseveral hundred dollarsoweing me but cannotcollect unless I sue forit, and now I ammortgageing my hometo raise the money to 
 pay the amount I owewhich I amc determinedto do at an early date Ifeel heartly ashamed ofmyslef, the reason Ifailed to write to thoseparties was because Iexpected to have the moneyto send every money andI wanted to money to gowith the letters, but Iwill write and make mattersright and will send the money at an early dateI expect in a shorttime to have the moneyas I have applied for aloan on my home andhave the promise of itand am anxious to payevery dollar I owe Godbeing my helper, and Ibelieve I done some goodwhile on my mission andI have not lost the goodSpirit, and there is noharder wroker in thiswrard than myself 
 for the building up of theKingdom, and I can saythere is no man inthis county or stake thatwould respond quickerto the call to go andpreach the gospel thanElder. S. W.

W. Woodruff& CounsellorsDear Brethren:Your favor 16thoct. received. I am grateful to you for Contents,and have failed to carry out your kind per-mission to close the printing in this officeperevious to Bro Andersons departure. Howeverwe have counselled over the situation tho-roughly, I believe, and have Concluded to shootup the press and let that ^work^ out first. Bro A. wasopposed to shutting up the composing loan; ^he^ thoughtwe could do better to keep it running for the present.I shall consider it thoroughly before I move contraryto his advise in this matter. I am strongly impressed to leave the building, and shall work with that endin view, as the Lord opens the way and the spiritintimates.I have called my son Albert into the office &also Bro. Callister. Albert has taken Bro. Cut-lers place. Wilby is here and has the spirit ofhis mission, we shall get on very well no doubt.The fog and rain, cold damp atmosphere, were tellingon me and I wanted my son near me. He is Competant 
 to fill the place I believe, for in advance of somewho have taken that department heretofore. BroCutler & Bro. Anderson have dwarfed their predecessors,and left a splendid record to guide their successors.It seems necessary to send a few more companies.Twenty souls, emigrants, and seven elders sailed onthe Arzona saturday. Another Company of eighteenemigrants and about seven elders will sailon the SS Nevada 5th prox. ^Wisconsin^ 22nd inst. Anothercompany will sail on the 5 of Nov. S.S. NevadaShall confine the numbers going on these vesselsto 25 souls or thereabouts. There are saints whowant to go later in Nov. perhaps a company onthe S.S. Arizona which sails on the 12th prox.If it is convenient will sail with my familyon that date for N. Y. I shall return on her ^Arizona^ sofar as I know at present unless otherwise instructedby you.The tithing of the mission has, through hard times,sunk to nothing. Fair prospects for converts in someplaces, considering the times. The elders are hopefuland have put in good work during the summer in out-door preaching.Mrs ^sister^ Esselman has sued Guion & Co. for goods destroyed ^by fdisinfecting on Wyoming N Y.^or threatened to do so. She had better sue the state. Mr. Rams-den much annoyed with this complaint for he was power-less to help it. I have assured him of my feelings on the subject.Love to the brethren in which we all joinYour Bro in Christ Brigham Young 
 42 Islington L.pool Eng.Aug 20th 1892.Prest Wilford WoodruffSalt Lake City UtahDear Brother: I have no desire to increase your burdens, God knowsyou have enough to bear, but I have been muchexercised concerning a few points contained inBro. Roberts lecture ^which he^ delivered before the mMutual iIm-provement Ass[ociati]on on authority of Priesthood.I quote a few a fewseveral items which have cometo my mind, and in all that I say I desire to giveno offensce to my brethren in any particular. I cannot say there is one iota of untruth contained in thelecture, but in my judgement the lecturer does not ex-plain, sufficiently, points of vital importance. These ^points^have a double signifficance at this period of politicalexcitement; and ^the^ puting forth "liberal" ideas ^in political matters^ whichhave brought our Republic to the verge of desolution,and will ^yet^ prove an important factors in the ultimateoverthrow of man made governments, vis perfect freedomto lie debanch, the stronger oppress the weak, the rich growricher the poor grow poorer; the spirit shrinks and the bodyenlarge its beastly propensities, are distressing to contemplate.Please give mey ideas consideration and send me theadvice and counsel that is necessary to make ^me^ wise as a 
 serpent and harmless as a dove.I have always believed that, when when Christs author-ized servants had it revealed unto them that a certainman was the individual to preside over the church—Hischurch, this might be sustained, but not revoked by His people.I have the privilege of showing to God and man that, I amin harmony with that revelation and my sign of cove-nant is the evidence, which I can produce on the spot,of my unswerving allegiance to Him. All things are done bycommon consent which comes through obedience to thehead."Joseph presided over the church by the voice of the people." Very true, and the people were the churchof Christ because they sustained His prophet, whichis equally true."Joseph presided over the church etc." "The people choseto have it so." "He always filled that station by the voiceof the people." These statements are all true, but I thinkthat, with^out^ further explenation they are calculated to mis-lead the minds of our children. If it is deemed wisdomto leave these things as they are—as they appear in print, Iam content. Please render me a little assistance to putthe break on with a little more force."Eeclesiastical governments as well as civil derivetheir just powers from the consent of the governed." I am in-clined to think that, there is a destinction between h the ^two^ govern-ments, God calls and authorizes a man, he gathers the peopleand they sustain him. Men gather and appoint ^or elect^ theirhead. One originates in God, the other in man. 
 In comparison, God has a fine stepper properly harnessedto his ^beautifuly proportioned vehiacle^ to bear the burthen; while man has nothing buta push cart. True, majorities controle in the world &they ^the wicked^ will seek to push this doctrine upon us, on purposeto destroy the church. I know their cunning is not equal tothe wisdom of God, and I pray for strength to stand whenthese two powers will, apparently, so nearly tie that the boldestwill tremble in the conflict. A bare majority of the people mayreject the prophets of God and by their votes sustain men more con-genial to their tastes, but in doing this they cut out the only receivingoffice on the line through which revelation can come to them. The mai-jnority who sustain the prophet by their votes, are all that is left of thechurch of Christ.The agency of man consists in his having ^had^ power delegatedto him to select his master. I exercise my will power by beingobedient to the chosen of the Lord. I believe our youth should betaught to sustain the authorities of the church irrespective ofof numbers. I fix my eyes upon you; I listen to your counsel,I try to live to have the same spirit that actuates you. The testimony ofthe spirit in one is that, your mistakes—should you make any—will beoverruled by God for His glory and the good of His people. I beseechthe Father to give me strength to follow you as you follow Christ our Lord.Will the time ever come when a majority of those claiming mem-bership in the church—whatever object they have had in joining thechurch—will reject the Presidency and Apostles by vote in the generalassembly of the people. I beleive the devil has that little game on foot—that is, the idea, exists in the hearts of men today.I am content to leave things as they are for now I feel better. If Ihave hurt your feelings in any wise forgive me. I could not rest until I hadchatted with the presidency.I strive to do my duty in my weak way. In contrast with the brightnessof the more youthful elders, there is much of the old fogy in me I find.Love to the brethren. God bless you dear brotherI am your^s^ in ChristBrigham Young

Cannon andJoseph F. Smith; Dear Brethren:Your cable received andit met our hearty endorsment. Our next company sailson the S.S. Alaska 1st prox, and numbers about thirty (30)souls: This is the last company we shall send until thingslook more favourable. We expect the "Arizona" to sail onthe 15th prox. and she will carry a number of our elders,Bro. Jas H. Anderson among them. We shall welcomeBro. Dougall and trust that he is all sufficient tofill the place on the Star, vacated by Bro. Anderson.We could not expect him to be as efficient as Bro. Jas. inevery department: he must live many years and improveevery moment of his time in order to reach the plane ofintelligence to which Bro. Anderson has attained. I tell youbrethren I am a mere babe in current intelligence: andI believe that it needs a much more intelligent manthan myself to carry on this business successfully—that iskeep the mission and the Star up to their present status.I beg of you brethren to send as many missionaries this fall as you convieniently can. I wish we had two hun-dred more men in the field. True we do not makemany converts, but what we are doing requires morehelp. The neglected districts containing millions of 
 people who are ripe for salvation, or damnation,where the labors of efficient elders are greatly needed,may be counted by the score; the conference Presidentsappeal to me in vain for more help. If agreeable toyou and circumstances favour it, I shall send my family home sometime before Christmas: and if youare willing, shall cross the water to N.Y. with themproviding it will cost nothing for me to go and return.My wife is timid and will hardly be willing to sailwithout me. She could remain in a warm climate,which would cost money: but funds are scarcewith all parties at present. Bro. Cutler and I visitedMr Ramsden today: our interview was very satisfactory.I informed him it was doubtful about our sendingany more emigrants after the 1st prox. until we knewmore definitely concerning actions of those whipper-snapperson the other side of the Atlantic. He agreed with usit would be unwise to send companies of emigrants,especially in consideration of the action taken in relationto the intermediate passengers on S. S. Pavonia, Cunard line.The Wisconsin and Arizona are now on the water carrying companiesof our people in 2nd cabin, who may be treated the same asthe Pavonia people—vis. quarintined for three weeks. Yourfavour, 9th inst., pertaining to Bro. Dougall just received: Ithank you much for the official information and with thehelp of God we shall succeed in our duties so longas we are relegated to this land. My health has beenprecarious: the back part of my head occassioning mepain and trouble: but I am much better now. Themission is prosperous and all well.

W. Musser a few days since datedHaifa, Palestine Sept 6th 1892 in which he says heand Elder Adolf Haag arrived there on August 31stby way of Alexandria Port Said and Jappa. Thereare but two members of the Church at Haifa.Bro Grau and Sister Tegel, the latter an old lady whowas desirous of donating 100000 franks for the TurkishMission, and had paid him 500 franks of the amount.He states that since arriving in Turkey Bro Haagshealth has not been good, and the day before he wrotewhich would be Sept 5th he complained of notfeeling quite well and so went and laid down.In about an hour he awoke burning up with fever,in a few moments he was so weak he could hardlysit up and his heart was very much affected, andfor a time Bro Musser was very much alarmed. Headministered to him, and his heart became better buthis fever was alarmingly high, he doctered him as besthe could all day but about 3 oclock in the morningbe became worse. They gave him a good sweatingand when he woke he appeared to be better and was 
 resting niceley. and they felt confident the Lord wouldspare him to complete his mission and let himreturn to his loved onces in Zion, he thought itwould be unwise to keep him in Turkey andthought the climate of Germany or Switzerlandwould suit him better, and I intendedmaking the change, but it was not to be, forthe next news that I received was a Telegramfrom Bro Musser dated Haifa 8 pm receivedlast night saying "Elder Haag is dead"signed "Muszer," which I presume is intendedfor Musser.Elder Haag arrived hereMarch 15th having left his home at PaysonFeby 18 [18]92, he labored in the Swiss & GermanMission until the beginning of July, when hestarted for the Turkish Mission. We shallanxiously await Bro Mussers letters withdetails and will on their arrival immediatelywrite you.

 yet some orchards will bear a middling crop—some veryfine apples in the orchards.President Young's apple trees are some of themloaded, and a good crop of peaches; his grape vines areloaded, I think he will have 2 or 3000 lbs of grapes this season.It is a general time of health in this Territory except a company that came in from the Mississippi brought the small pox with them, but it has not spread much yet, andwe hope it will not.A company arrived from Carson Valley on the 28thinst, they report that Murray, who was tried for murderlast winter was killed by the Indians, also a man by the name of Reddin.Your family are all well. Brothers Bates and LukeJohnson are about to start on a Mission of about one month, with Seth M. Blair to Ruby Valley on an exploring expedition to open a new route to Carson Valley. They expectto meet bro Enoch Reese with a company from Carson to cooperate with them.Our Agricultural and Manufacturing Society aremaking quite an exertion to promote Home Manufacturesin this Territory, as the time has come when we see that weare under the necessity of making in a great measure what we use. The various Wards of the City and Territory areforming auxiliary branches of the same; intending to Manu-facture all they can for home consumption.During this month Elder Parley P. Pratt and a 
 opposite Prest. Young's buildings.On the 29th Ulto we had a general muster and inspectionof the Nauvoo Legion. Lieut. Gen. Wells and his staff received thetroops, after which a hollow square was formed and the Lieut. Gen. delivered an animating address to the troops, which was well sustainedby the officers of his staff and chaplain.We have had much excellent preaching lately by the FirstPresidency and others. Prest. Young has come out boldly and told thispeople in the name of the Lord, they must repent and be baptizedfor the remission of their sins. Several Wards have gone forwarden masse been baptized and renewed their covenants before the Lord,and I believe the fire of a universal reformation in this Territoryhas been lit and will continue to burn, until a permanentfoundation for good works has been laid in our midst. We must say since the organization of this church our ears have never beensaluted with more pointed Godlike sermons, than have flowed latelyfrom Prest. Young and his counsellors.We are happy to announce the arrival of Elders F. D.Richards, Daniel Spencer, Jos. A. Young W. H. Kimball Geo. D. Grant, James Ferguson, John Van Cott, C. H. Wheelock, N. H. Felt,Wm. C. Dunbar, J. T. D. McAlister & James McGaw.yours trulyW Woodruff 
 On the 31st October, brother Gideon D. Gibbs and HoraceNewell arrived from Elder Willie's hand cart coy., whom they left onthe sweetwater, when the teams sent out at conference arrived atthis camp, there had been twenty deaths, nineteen of them men.and while with them in one day there were fifteen burials, and whenthe messengers left there had been fifty deaths. They did not seemto be sick, but chilled through, men would dig graves for theirbrethren, and before night would die themselves. They had distributed their last rations of Flour the night before the brethren met themand they did not know that any relief was at hand.The reason of this difficulty and suffering [ink faded] with theemigration is in consequence of the companies starting so late, and the early falling of snow in the mountains. Prest. Young hasuniversally given counsel for the emigration to start early.The hand cart companies who started early came in well indeedbetter than the most sanguine could have expected.yours truly,W.
