Sunday FIGURE I did not sleep but little during the night I arose this Morning and found the snow about 2 feet deep and still falling thick and fast, it looked vary gloomy I did not know what course to pursue I could ^not^ travel the road and I went and Enquired of Mr Haven the operator  and Agent in that place what chance there was of takigng a car He said he had No baggage car there and if he had, he did not know how  I could get my waggon or horses on board of it as all the  accomodations of the kind was moved to Evanston. I could not  buy any grain in the place for it was not there and the ownly Hay  there was in the hands of Mr Hammer an Apostate Mormon and vary bitter I had put in about 100 lbs of Hay when I started from  Randolph which was all I had to feed the snow was covering  up my waggon I went over to My Horses and gave them a little Hay and knelt down and prayed for the Lord to Deliver me I could get No watter to my horses ownly as Brother Rowley who had charge  of the Engine run it upon a trak near my horses and poured me out 4 Buckets of water this I divided between them while I was there I went to bed at night with the snow still falling and all things looked gloomy   ENDENTRY November 27, 1871 ~ Monday   Nov 27, 1871   FIGURES This was quite an important day day with me I arose in the morn- ing and found the snow 3 feet deep on the level and still snowing furiously and I could see no way to find deliverance for myself and team unless the  Lord opened the way. Evry thing was glomy I had to wallow to my arms pits in snow to go to my horses or any whare Els. Mr Haven had sent to Evanston for a car for me the night before by my request but how to get my waggon and team on to it was the great question I talked with Mr Haven in the Morning concerning the prospect of Getting on board of a car. He did not see how it could be done. My waggon  was covered with snow, and some 300 yards from the Depo and No help to get it there except the Chimamen in the Hands of Carpenter who was Employed to keep the rail road track clear of snow. I talked with Carpenter and he said he had no right to take his men from  the rail Road to dig a span of Horses and waggon out of the snow to get them on board of the cars it was under these circumstances that I wallowed through 3 feet of snow some 300 yards to My Horses in the storehouse I went to them rubed them down carressed them but could not feed them except as it were a morsel I knelt down and prayed Earnestly to the Lord to Deliver me and my team, it might be thought a small matter to leave a team to starve to Death and take the cars and save my own life but my team had saved mine, had wallowed through the snow some 12 miles to save mine and I felt it my duty to do all in my power to save theirs. I prayed Earnestly to the Lord to  Deliver me and save my Animals from starvation. The spirit of the Lord came upon me while Praying and I had a testimony while praying that my Prayers would be answered and that I should be delivered I arose from my knees and wallowed some 60 rods through 3 feet of snow to the Telegraph office and talked with Mr Haven the operator and Agent at wasatch. I told him he must Help Me. The spirit of the Lord rested upon him and he said he would do all in his  power for my deliverance and we went together to see Mr Carpenter the same spirit same upon him and he said he would do all He could he had ten Chinamen with him he told them to take their shovels and follow him we all went to whare the Horses and waggon  was and it took us some 5 Hours to dig out the waggon and open a road some 400 yards to the Depo and to get our Horses and waggon there we then had to   ENDENTRY Nov 27, 1871   build a stageing some 10 feet high out of plank to get the Horses up and covered it with coal sinders when I brought the Horses to it they would not go up. I them went to Mr Hammer an Apostate Mormon and bitter at that who had the ownly hay in the place and asked him to sell me 50 cts worth of Hay. He caught the same spirits of the others went and put up the hay and carried it for me to the Depo I laid it on the platform at  the Head of the stageing and both of My Horses readily went to it I led them inside we then went to work and had to take the waggon all to peaces and lift it up a wheel to at a time some 8 feet perpendicular to get it in- to the store house. when the freight train came along Mr Haven stoped  it and had the Engineer take his Engine and bring up the car 100 yards to the platform for me to load my Horses and waggon in. I got my Horses in without difficulty but in trying to get my Box in with the Bows and cover on we got stuck fast with one End on the platform and the other against the side of the car the Engineer would not wait any longer but started on with his train and left me Mr Haven telegraphed to Evanston to send him another Engine we went to work took the cover and Bows of the waggon Box and got it loaded and when I got all my things on board and got on board with my Horses and waggon and myself an Engine came Down from Evanston and Mr Haven ordered the Engineer to hitch on to that car and take it to Ogden and he done so but did not like it much as He had to travel something like 160 miles to go to Ogden and back just to take me down when the car started I bid my Friends good by and  knelt down by the side of My Horses and felt to return harty thanks to God my Heavenly Father for the Deliverance he had wrought out for me I had wallowed in the snow all day untill I was wet to my  armpits I changed my clothing in the car and rode in the car 65 Miles to Ogden without a fire I arived in Ogden abot 10 oclok I went  to Bishop Herricks and spent the night    ENDENTRY November 28, 1871 ~ Tuesday   28 I arose in the morning refreshed by sleep Bishop Herrick loand me $25 to pay my Bill at the Rail Road and received his pay again in Salt Lake City the same day.

Pratt spoke first and refered to the time he first FIGURES saw Joseph Smith in the same house whare the first Branch of the Church was organized said he wished that there could be a small plain history of Joseph Smith written by some one who had a good Memory by some one who could remember the circumstances as they were. said he received a testimony there that he knew the work was of God it was not by the Administration of Angels or open vision but by the Holy Ghost He made other remarks. He was followed By W. Woodruff I said there was one subject I wished to speak upon and that was writing  and keeping a Journal of the dealings of God with us I have many times  thought the Quorum of the Twelve and others considered me rather enthu- siastic upon this subject But when the Prophet Joseph organized the Quorum of the Twelve he Commanded them to write and keep a Journal or History of their lives and gave his reasons why they should do it I think the Twelve Apostles and all the Holy Priesthood should keep a Journal of their official acts and the dealings of God with them I would be glad to read the Acts of My forefathers if they had never  herd of a God. But esspecially when men are called to stand at the head of a Great dispensation like this and to build up the kingdom of God on  the Earth to remain forever, they of all men on Earth ought to write  and keep a true and correct History of the rise and progress of that Kingdom, of the Revelations of Jesus Christ and his dealings with us as we travel   ENDENTRY Jan 20, 1872   along in our pilgrimage. I have had this spirit upon me since I first  Entered this Chirch I was Baptized the first sermon I herd and from  that day untill now I have kept a daily Journal whenever I have herd Joseph Smith preach, teach, or prophesy, I have always felt it my duty  to write it. I have always felt uneasy I could not Eat drink or sleep in peace untill I did write it and my mind has been so Exercised upon this subjects that when I herd Joseph Smith teach and I had not pen- cil and paper I would go home and set down and write that whole sermon almost word for word and sentence By sentence as it was deliver and when I had written it, it was taken from me I remembered it no more this was the gift of God to me and the question has often rested me why are these things so, why has this subject rested upon me more than other men again another Question has rested upon my mind many times? why has the devil sought to take my life from the day I was born untill  now more than other men, for I been a marked victim for the devil from the day I was born untill now, and I can find but  one answer and that is the devil knew if I got into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints I would write the History of the Church and leave on Record the doings, works, and teachings of the prophets and Apostles latter days, and that I would attend to the Ordinances of the House of God. For my Fathers Household and Friends both for the living and the dead. I am the ownly person in all the lineage of my Fathers Household Either on my Father or Mothers side who has been in the Church and in a situation to do any thing for my Fathers House I Baptized my Father and all his household that He had  with him at the time including my half sister I am the ownly person that has attended to any of the ordinances  of the Church for my Dead. Again I have recorded nearly all the sermons and teachings that I Ever herd Joseph Smith deliver and many  of the Quorum of the Twelve I have in my Journals scores of sermons  of President Brigham Young that He does not know that Exist on  Earth so of Orson Pratt, and others, one reason I have Been moved upon to write in Early days was nearly all the Historians appointed in the Early History of the Church Apostitized and took the Journals away with them which in a measure  were lost to the Church. I still keep a daily Journal but I have not   ENDENTRY Jan 20, 1872   reported sermons much for many years for we have had scribes  and reporters to keep a record of the sayings of the Prophets and Apostles and I rejoice and thank God for it does my soul good to look upon these little Boys sons of Brother George Q Cannon and others set at the reports  table and report the sermons as they are delivered from the mouth of  the Prophets and Apostles I would there were 10 whare their is but one Another Subject I wish to say a few words upon and that is the spirit of God to man, the Holy Ghost which is given to the saints, The  inspiration of the Almighty which giveth the spirit of man under- standing it is the greatest testimony man can possess, his Eyes and Ears  may be deceived in seeing the miracles such as the magicians in the days of fals Prophets and beasts of the last day will  perform wbut when the Elect receive the Holy Ghost they will not be deceived ##Exodus 7:22## but man is apt to look to high or Expect too great things so that they often times mistake the spirit of God and the inspiration of the Almighty it is not in the Thunder or whirlwind that we should look for the spirit  of God but in the still small voice "The wind Bloweth whare it listeth and ye hear the sound thereof but cannot tell whence it cometh or whether  it goeth so all is the spirit saith Jesus" ##John 3:8## We should all become acquainted  with this spirit and obey its voice for it hath preserved the prophets Apostles and Elders for the last 40 years in their travels upon the Earth. We have all Experienced this from time to time our lives have been preserved by listning to the whisperings of that still small voice. When I was going  to Boston in the spring of 1848 with my family I drove into the door yard of one of the Brethren tied my Mules to a large oak tree and went  to Bed in my carriage with my carriage ^family^ the spirit came upon  me and told me to get up and move my ^carriage^ and my mules I did so and it was but  a short time untill a whirlwing took that oak tree broak it into nom  the ground and brought it some 12 rods and laid it prostrate in that dooryard  and the body of fall whare my carriage stood and if I had not moved it  I should have been killed with my family. Again when I was bri- nging the Eastern Saints to this valley when I arived in Pitsburgh  I chartered a steemboat to take the saints to St Louis as soon as I had done it the spirit said to me dont go abord of that Boat. the Captain released me and I chartered another the steemer that  I first chartered started down the river soon took fire burned   ENDENTRY Jan 20, 1872   the wheel cha ropes into and nearly all the passenger Either burned to death or drowned many in this Church have Experienced these  things, and in all the travels and Emigrations of the saints for the last  40 years the preserving care of our Hevenly Father has been over  us and we as a people have been preserved while the wicked have been destroyed upon Evry hand, the destruction of the saluda  is the ownly case whare the saints have met with disaster in their Emigration, and if Eli B. Kelsey who was the leader of the company had had the spirit of God and his office upon him he never would have gone on board of that Boat or taken the saints on board of it I would Exhort all the Saints to get the spirit of God and keep it and live under its influence, and then they are always safe.
