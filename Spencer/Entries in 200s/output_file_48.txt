Nearly her sole dependencein the Male line is Bro Hyrum, & if henow goes it will be a great hardship,but as soon as Bro James Esano returnswho is now the Prest of the Sheffield Conference& who also is a son in law.

 OFFICE ofTHE UTAH SUGAR CO.,Lehi City, Utah April 24th, 1891.President Wilford Woodruff,Salt Lake City.Dear Brother:You may possible remember that on the last day ofCenference a brother from this town named Henry Lewis stepped upto the stand and spoke to you about his wife being sick, his namehad been proposed as a missionary by the Liverpool office as ayoung man who would made a good missionary to the British Isles;he is one of our steadiest and best hands working on the SugarFactory, and he had agreed when Lehi made up its subscriptionlist for stock in the fFactory to put in $500.00, when he was calledon this mission he had already paid $250.00 and he came to me andtold me that if he could sell that stock that he had already paidand be realeased also from that, that he had agreed to pay that hewould have enough means to go with, and his family could live inhis absence. I told him that if he was really called that wewould do our best to pay him the $250.00 that he had already paid.His wife is now much better and he is ready to go in abouttwo weeks if he is required to go, but I was quoting his case inthe Directors met^e^ting in Brother James Jack's office on Tuesdayevening last merely to show the difficulties that some times wehave to contend against. wWhere people have agreed to take stockin the Factory and failed for some cause or other. It is va verytight time just now andd to be candid it is going to cripple us inthis town to a certain extent both to part with him and also tohave to pay him the money as we are having a very hard pull todo as we have agreed to, on account of lacks of funds amongst thepeople.Bros. Thatcher & Grant who were at the Directors meeting feltthat he ought to be released, and while I feel very delicate inasking such favors still I desire to present the case before youand if you could release him under these circumstances it wouldbe a great favor to Lehi. I will say that he does not know any-thing of this letter. He is also one of the liveliest men we havegot in collecting means for the Defence fund, and though I also ^but^claim that I take pride in sending some of the most useful men wehave from this Ward as missionaries. We have already four in theEuropean mission and who are some of our best men. Those that wereexcused a short time ago are all gone with the exception of one,and he is making preparation to go next fall.I remain, very truly your brother in the Gospel,Thomas. R. Cutler

 I believe your keen sense of Justicewill prompt you in this case, as ineverything you do, to see that whateverrights Dr. Joseph has in this matter shallbe respected if possible.  So far as mypersonal knowledge of the matter isconcerned, I have been convinced fromthe start that there was a fair and squarebargain made between Bp. E. Hunterand J. S. Richards in regard to that pieceof land; but when it came before Prest.Taylor for settlement, as pr. the agreementwith Bp Hunter, Prest. Taylor delayedand postponed the matter until circumstanceschanged and it became apparent to meit was no use pressing him further in regardto it.  I then advised Dr. Richards towait awhile until a more favorabletime should come, and I believed thenhe would get the land.  I think a bargainis a bargain, and it should be respected.If Bp. Hunter had no right to makea bargain with Dr. Richards, then boththe Bp. and Dr. R. were laboring undera mistake.  I am fully persuaded thatBp. Hunter made the agreement to let Dr

 Richards have the land for the same pricein cash that it was turned in for ontithing. At that time money was anobject and land was not so much soughtfor, and that Bp. Hunter made the agreementat all, is proof that he did it in good faithand I never could tell why it was not,or ought not to be carried out in good faith.The only reason I could give why itwas not done is that Prest. Taylor had ahabit of putting off almost everythingof this kind indefinitely. I do not think DrRichards has been dealt with fairly in thematter, not that I blame any body, Isimply charge it to Prest. Taylor's habit ofprocrastination. I spoke to him manytimes about it, and while he neverdenied Joseph's claims or refused to [ace-sed] to them, he persisted in putting it offuntil I advised the Dr. to wait till somemore favorable time. I believe a bargainmade by Bp. Hunter is entitled to the respectof the counsil, and should not be ignored.I believe Dr. Joseph's claim to the right to purchase that piece of land is just and should berespected.

 MANUAL TRAINING SCHOOL:Some of our most responsible and representative menhave for some time been considering the beniefits to be derived from a school of manual training, and the advisability of opening an Acad[e]my of this kind, for the [e]ducation of young men in the practical branchesof the mechanical arts.It is an apparent fact that not enough of the youth of Utah are adopt-in[g] the mechanical trades as a [me]ans of livelihood, and as a consequencemechanics from other parts of the Country are filling the places that could and should be occupied by our own people; which condition of af-fairs has been viewed with apprehension by some of those who have thematerial interests of th[e] people of our Territory most at heart, and aremedy has been studied by them; the outgrowth of which is the contemp-lated opening of such an Academy as above referred to, with a Capitalstock of $200,000.00 divided into 4000 shares of the par value of $50.0[0]per share.It is hoped that all who are interested in the best advancement of ouryoung people will subscribe for enough of the stock in said contemplat[e]dCompany to effect an incorporation at once.As soon as ten (10) per cent of the stock has been subscribed a meetingwill be called and officers elected.The following persons hereby pledge themselves to subscribe for the number of shares in said Company set opposite their respective names:
