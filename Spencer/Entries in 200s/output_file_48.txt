Husbands are wanted on the St. John's  group of islands in the South Pacific Ocean. Captain Bergman of the American ship Bonanza says that bashful young men afraid to pop the question need not go through the world without a mate if they  will only go to these little coral islands in  the Southern seas. The Captain's ship was becalmed a few months ago close to the main island of the group and for nearly a whole day she lay scarcely moving a foot. In that time he  and every man of his crew had more offers of marriage than they could count on their  fingers and toes and go over them a second  time.  The ship was besieged with women seek- ing husbands, and for a time the Captain said the women threatened to carry himself and his crew ashore and marry them whether they favored the match or not. The Captain, in a report to the United States Hydrographic office of this manless Eden and the numerous offers of marriage made to him and his crew, says he only escaped by promising to come back in a few days with a whole shipload of men and give every one of the clamoring maidens a  good husband.

Several times such expeditions were repeated and every time the natives enjoyed a banquet, and at last all attempts at trade were given up. The natives are of the same race as those who inhabited the Solomon group. Even fiercer were they than the Bushmen, who a few weeks ago slaughtered Baron von Norbeck and several of the crew of the Austrian training ship Albatross on Gua- dalcaner island.   Captain said, are ruled by a queen known  as Plea Waar. At one time she led the women of her island in the many battles they had with the inhabitants of the other atolls of the group, but when their sorrows came they learned that war was not all that made them happy. Their fondness for ban- quets at which the men of their race were entertained brought all their present woes and peace among all the four islands of the group was declared. At that time only a few hundred men remained and the wo- men outnumbered them almost ten to one. When that state of affairs existed the trad- ers gained a small foothold on the islands. The women were easily pleased with the bright trinkets offered to them and the few men left dared not say them nay when they desired to make a purchase. The men meek- ly fell into the ways of the women and the queen was the boss of the Government. Her chief had lost his rule. With this state of affairs in the island a strange craft drop- ped anchor off the reefs and in the week  that followed all the able-bodied men in   on the vessel for some plantations in South America.   were left yearly two thousand women on the island, and only a hundred old men. Husbands they wanted, but none were to be had. That state of affairs had existed nearly a year when the Bonanza drifted  close to the island, and the Captain and his crew had a narrow escape from being kid- naped into matrimony.   as far as he could ascertain, have overcome their fondness for human banquets, and he assures any young men looking for an easy, indolent life that he can do no better than accept the offer of the queen of the St. John's group. He can have as many wives as he  desires and a home that will be supplied with all the luxuries of a tropical isle, and he won't have to even ask for it if he once sets foot in the dusky queen's domain.   in appearance," said the Captain, "although they are ignorant of the many aids to beauty that are known in fashionable life. They are of simple habits and indulge in none of the luxuries that have prevented many men from entering into the matrimonial state.   be inconsequential in the budget of house- hold expenses, for they practice an economy in dress that is simply astonishing. Their costumes are beautiful in their simplicity and set off their charms in a bewitching manner. Nor because they are of a canni- balistic race should it be supposed that they are devoid of that true affection which should mark the partner of one's bosom. True enough, it might at times be somewhat unpleasant to contemplate at dinner a shin- bone or two and wonder whether they were the remains of a lately deceased mutton or once carried some other fellow. Yet, sur- rounded by all the comforts of a home in  the dreamiest of South-sea islands, where   casts his lot upon any of the islands of St. John and allows himself to be carried into wedlock, might easily imagine himself su- premely happy.   the Bonanza was besieged with the dusky charmers, all willing to be wed. Some came off in canoes and others swam from the  shore, but whether they arrived on deck, glistening with the nut oil, which is their greatest beautifier, or dripping with brine, all came with the same mission.   They had nothing to say about the suffrage question, nor did they discuss the tem- perance problem. Not even the most world- ly wise wished to exact a promise that her chosen one would stay home o'nights and not run around to the other islands, talking politics. They promised not to gossip and to be obedient in all things if only some one would marry them right away.   of women from carrying off my entire crew.

As she is the absolute monarch of all she surveys, including the surround- ing reefs and atolls that are unsurveyed, she would be a great prize for the lucky man who might win her dusky heart and not bloodless hand.

They might take down there a hundred or  two of the young scions of Zion and estab- lish a branch kingdom in the South seas. The possibilities of such a scheme are be- yond computation. The Queen would ac- cept the Mormons with open arms.   popular with traders, the women are like the trees and fruit of their island home --- nature's own creations.

I know of no man who has labored more faithfully and energetically. None were too insignificant for his notice. He took an interest in all. There is no man whose life is a better example for the youth of Israel. My ideal of an apostle was Erastus Snow. When I was called as an apostle I prayed that the same spirit of self-sacrifice might inspire me. No man can say anything but good of him. He has been a Latter-day Saint in very deed, and has gained an exaltation in the celestial kingdom of God. It was in- tended to read the last sermon he delivered, at a young men's meeting, April 8, 1888, but there is not time. He then said: "The Lord keeps His own counsels in these things, and it is not given to us to know and under- stand the day and the hour when the Son of Man will come; but it is for us always to be prepared, and to so live that we shall be prepared for Him when He does come. And whether we lay down our bodies before the coming of the Son of Man or not it  mattereth not, so that we have filled our days with usefulness, are prepared  to come forth when the trump shall sound and call forth the dead. I do most heartily endorse those senti- ments which have been expressed concerning the dead who die in the Lord. They do not taste of death. It seems to me that there is no death, but they are moving on to life—life eternal." Brother Erastus is moving on to life eternal, and may we follow in his footsteps.   written by Apostle Moses Thatcher.   even among Latter-day Saints—how few, indeed, of his immediate associ- ates—comprehended his worth, or fully appreciated his generous, un- selfish disposition.   intellectual giant, yet humble as a child.

In the future, when dark clouds of persecution are riven by the fierce lightnings of hate, and wrathful storms beat upon defenseless heads, who can fill the place of Erastus Snow? In times of peace, when the allurements of a deceitful ease threa- tened danger in the path of unsus- pecting youth, who will be able to supplement the wise counsel that hath laid the foundation for many a pros- perous, pure, and patient life?

His mortal career is ended. For the cause of his taking away we must search amid the burning sands and gleaming volcanic rocks of Southern Utah, where has been spent the best years of his life. Many a weary night he had sought repose while exhausted nature—sweat- ing at every pore—was chilled by the winds sweeping the cactus plains of Mexico or sighing through the pines of the Sierra Madre. To those who, in their misguided enforcement of the law, have deprived him of the conso- lation and comforts of home, what shall the harvest be? Under trying circumstances he recently endured a  severe operation upon his eyes. Ex- hausted by the pain inflicted, and while trying to rest in a room and bed  to which he was unused, he contracted a severe cold that resulted in his death.   affliction exclaimed, "I would give more this moment to see Erastus Snow than any man living, for he could tell me what to do in this hour of supreme trial."   beautiful and perfect in every part it now in the presence of death seems.

As defender of constitutional liberty, valiant and con- sistent. As a servant of God, faith- ful, devoted, true. Magnanimous to enemies, generous to friends. Un- swerving in life, trusting and confident in death. Such was Erastus Snow. Let the fingers of fame weave garlands with which to entwine the brow of battle-begrimmed heroes!

He possessed a judicial mind, and had he followed the profession of the law none would have excelled him for the greatness of his decisions. God was with him. I have seen His power manifest in him. Brother Erastus has worthily performed the labors of an apostle. He was among the fore- most in toil, usually working till the early hours of the morning. When it was found necessary to settle the de- sert soil of Southern Utah, Erastus Snow was called, and faltered not in the midst of difficulty. Frequently, when his body was racked with pain, he would go into the fields and coun- sel with the people. He was also father of the settlements in Arizona. There is no tribute that is not due to Erastus Snow. As a preacher of the Gospel, he was eloquent; as a colon- izer, true; as a legislator, wise; as a councilor, fearless; as a friend, un- swerving; as a father, unexcelled in love and integrity. I have looked  upon him as one of the brightest of earth's sons, and, had he remained in his native State, he would have shone in the councils of the nation. May  the blessings of heaven rest on his numerous family, and may we say of  them, they were worthy descendants of a noble sire, who was devoted to the work of God.   lowing letter from President Wilford Woodruff:   Once again, in the providences of the Almighty, Israel mourns the loss of one of its mightiest sons. Death sel- dom comes at a time we deem oppor- tune; and if we, in our blindess, were permitted to judge, we should certainly decide that the present, with its trials, its perplexities, and its sor- rows, is no time to take from our  midst men of counsel, of wisdom, of faith, and of judgment, such as was  our beloved brother, Elder Erastus Snow, whose obsequies we this day solemnize. But He who doeth all things well has been pleased to take to Himself His servant, and we can simply bow the head and acknowledge His hand in all things, and with one of old exclaim: "The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away; blessed be the name of the Lord."   prevent us from personally joining with you in this tribute of respect to our departed, and now sanctified, brother, whose departure from this mortal sphere has doubtless been hastened by the same causes that pre- vent us from joining you on this sad occasion. This enforced absence we sincerely regret, as we should have found a mournful satisfaction in add- ing our testimony to that of our brethren, touching the virtues, the in- tegrity, the zeal, the whole-hearted- ness, of our friend and co-labourer who has passed before us into the joys of eternity. For him we have  no cause to mourn; he has fought the good fight, he has finished his work, he has been true and faithful, and is now entering into that fairer and better world, the bliss of which the heart cannot conceive nor the natural  eye see, but the glories of which, by  reason of his obedience and devotion to God and His laws, had been sealed upon him through sacred ordinances and by the Holy Spirit of Promise while he yet tabernacled in mortality. May our end be like his.   never be forgotten in the history of the Church of Christ. From early youth to his latest day he was ever found in the unflinching performance of his duties as a servant of the Most High. Without exaggeration it can be said of him that he died with the harness on.

C. Iliff       E G Rognon President   ENDENTRY  we view him as a missionary of the Gospel of peace, as a legislator for the people of God, as a pioneer, convert- ing the wilderness into the fruitful field, as an apostle in the councils of the Church, we everywhere find him a man of no ordinary type, but one whose ability and strength of character marked him as a leader among men, even where great men were not lacking. It would be diffi- cult for us to pick out any one special department of life and say in this he most particularly shone, or select some other and assert in that he was most eminent. He was great in all.   dinavia he was perhaps greater as a missionary—the first apostle who bore the glad tidings of the Gospel to their fatherland. To the weary toiler be- neath the sultry sun of Southern Utah he was best known as the indefatig- able leader, who planned, devised, con- trived and arranged for their progress and made prosperity possible in one of the most arid, most forbidding regions of this great continent. His prudence, his wisdom, his foresight, are admitted by all—as a counselor he had few peers. His ripe experience, joined with his sound judgment, gave a weight to his words and a strength to his counsels that all who heard felt. Moreover, he possessed, unclouded by stain, those two great virtues that give a man power with the heavens— integrity and purity of character. Let a man possess these, let his heart be true and unflinching, let his life be pure, and, if we add to these humility, he is proof against a multitude of weaknesses and can resist a host of temptations. We all have our weak- nesses; God has permitted them that we might be taught humility in our- selves and charity towards others.   dwell in the flesh; but the man who in humble reliance upon God never falters in the fight for the right, never wavers in his allegiance to the truth, and ever maintains inviolate his covenants, is one whom we can all pause to admire, and strive, by heaven's help, to imitate. Such men are few when compared with the un- numbered hosts who have peopled this earth of ours; but we thank God that we do find them more abundantly  in the midst of the Saints, holding the Holy Priesthood and ministering in things the most sacred ever be- stowed upon humanity. Among these, in the front ranks, is our esteemed brother whose mortal remains are about to be consigned to the tomb.   has been one of the twelve apostles of the Lord Jesus. To this calling he has given the strength of his prime and the wisdom of his later years. It  has been during this period that he has performed a very large portion of his missionary, legislative and pioneer services. We shall sadly miss him in the quorum with which he has been so long identified, and of which he was at the time of his death one of the oldest members. We shall miss his mature consideration, his deliberate thoughts, his experienced advice—all most needful at a time when the powers of evil are assailing us in so many directions. But we thank the Lord that though from time to time He takes from us those who, as men, we trust most fondly, yet He leaves us not entirely to ourselves, but con- tinues unto us the signs of His ap- proval. We are comforted with the  assurance that this is His kingdom, and that He rules in the heavens and upon the earth; and that from the fall of a sparrow to the death of an apostle all is known unto Him, and nothing happens without His sanction.   are we not the sons and daughters of God, and when he shall appear, if we are faithful, shall we not be like him? Yes; and when the glorious day ar- rives we shall once more have the privilege of standing upon this earth and meeting in joy and thanksgiving, not only our brother who has just left us, but Brigham, and thousands of others who have washed their robes white in the blood of the Lamb, and who, through the merits of His atonement, are anointed kings and priests unto God, and with Him reign exalted in His kingdom.

About two years afterward, I dreamed father came to me while I was in bed, the house was lit up like day: he talked to me for some time, telling, which seems to me, things that were coming to pass, and things which I should do. After his conversation with me, he went out of the house, and I awoke or come to my self, for it seemed that I had not been asleep. There was considerable light in the house, I arose up and looked out of the window and saw the hills and mountains very plain and thought it was day light, as the moon give no light at that time, as it was near the new moon. I started to dress, when the thought came to me to think it all over, and I would be better able to tell mother, just as it was given me. I placed my elbow on the pillow and my hand over my eyes while I thought it over. Then I went to get up and found the room in darkness: it scared me so, that every thing father had said, was taken from me.

About a year after  that, I dreamed father came to me, he stood in the air above the ground, I thought it was his spirit. He asked me if I would finish his house, He then invited me to come and see what needed to be done. I went with him, and saw a large frame building standing on a solid rock foundation, but it needed the shingles, weather boarding, windows and doors. He asked me if I would finish it. I told Him I would. He then said:  "I am going away to be gone a long time before I come again to talk to  you." He than started up into heaven and continued untill he went out of my sight. I then awoke and found it to be a dream. It has now been about Twenty Five years since, and ^I^ have had no talk with him, in dream, which makes it seem the more remarkable.
