City Adam Speirs Bp ENDENTRY The Masculine Element Has Gone From St. John's  in the  South Seas, and  Thousands of Women  Clamor for  Husbands. Husbands are wanted on the St. John's  group of islands in the South Pacific Ocean. Captain Bergman of the American ship Bonanza says that bashful young men afraid to pop the question need not go through the world without a mate if they  will only go to these little coral islands in  the Southern seas. The Captain's ship was becalmed a few months ago close to the main island of the group and for nearly a whole day she lay scarcely moving a foot. In that time he  and every man of his crew had more offers of marriage than they could count on their  fingers and toes and go over them a second  time.  The ship was besieged with women seek- ing husbands, and for a time the Captain said the women threatened to carry himself and his crew ashore and marry them whether they favored the match or not. The Captain, in a report to the United States Hydrographic office of this manless Eden and the numerous offers of marriage made to him and his crew, says he only escaped by promising to come back in a few days with a whole shipload of men and give every one of the clamoring maidens a  good husband.

Elliott Nov 23 96 contaminated by the beachcomber and the  insolent trader whose shiftless presence on islands in direct communication with civi- lization has done so much toward influenc- ing the South-sea natives toward lives of crime and debauchery.  The natives are of the Papuan race, and up to a few years ago several traders who tried to barter some of their gaudy calicos and gew-gaws for the products of the island furnished inviting repasts for the chiefs and head men of the islands. Several times such expeditions were repeated and every time the natives enjoyed a banquet, and at last all attempts at trade were given up. The natives are of the same race as those who inhabited the Solomon group. Even fiercer were they than the Bushmen, who a few weeks ago slaughtered Baron von Norbeck and several of the crew of the Austrian training ship Albatross on Gua- dalcaner island.  These women sighing for husbands, the Captain said, are ruled by a queen known  as Plea Waar. At one time she led the women of her island in the many battles they had with the inhabitants of the other atolls of the group, but when their sorrows came they learned that war was not all that made them happy. Their fondness for ban- quets at which the men of their race were entertained brought all their present woes and peace among all the four islands of the group was declared. At that time only a few hundred men remained and the wo- men outnumbered them almost ten to one. When that state of affairs existed the trad- ers gained a small foothold on the islands. The women were easily pleased with the bright trinkets offered to them and the few men left dared not say them nay when they desired to make a purchase. The men meek- ly fell into the ways of the women and the queen was the boss of the Government. Her chief had lost his rule. With this state of affairs in the island a strange craft drop- ped anchor off the reefs and in the week  that followed all the able-bodied men in  the group were induced to take passage on the vessel for some plantations in South America.  When the black-birder sailed away there were left yearly two thousand women on the island, and only a hundred old men. Husbands they wanted, but none were to be had. That state of affairs had existed nearly a year when the Bonanza drifted  close to the island, and the Captain and his crew had a narrow escape from being kid- naped into matrimony.  Captain Bergman says the dusky belles, as far as he could ascertain, have overcome their fondness for human banquets, and he assures any young men looking for an easy, indolent life that he can do no better than accept the offer of the queen of the St. John's group. He can have as many wives as he  desires and a home that will be supplied with all the luxuries of a tropical isle, and he won't have to even ask for it if he once sets foot in the dusky queen's domain.  "The women are by no means unattractive in appearance," said the Captain, "although they are ignorant of the many aids to beauty that are known in fashionable life. They are of simple habits and indulge in none of the luxuries that have prevented many men from entering into the matrimonial state.  "Their dry-goods bill, for instance, would  be inconsequential in the budget of house- hold expenses, for they practice an economy in dress that is simply astonishing. Their costumes are beautiful in their simplicity and set off their charms in a bewitching manner. Nor because they are of a canni- balistic race should it be supposed that they are devoid of that true affection which should mark the partner of one's bosom. True enough, it might at times be somewhat unpleasant to contemplate at dinner a shin- bone or two and wonder whether they were the remains of a lately deceased mutton or once carried some other fellow. Yet, sur- rounded by all the comforts of a home in  the dreamiest of South-sea islands, where  all nature teaches one to love, a man who casts his lot upon any of the islands of St. John and allows himself to be carried into wedlock, might easily imagine himself su- premely happy.  "When we anchored off the main island the Bonanza was besieged with the dusky charmers, all willing to be wed. Some came off in canoes and others swam from the  shore, but whether they arrived on deck, glistening with the nut oil, which is their greatest beautifier, or dripping with brine, all came with the same mission.  "Husbands they demanded as a right. They had nothing to say about the suffrage question, nor did they discuss the tem- perance problem. Not even the most world- ly wise wished to exact a promise that her chosen one would stay home o'nights and not run around to the other islands, talking politics. They promised not to gossip and to be obedient in all things if only some one would marry them right away.  "I had a hard time preventing that army of women from carrying off my entire crew. They only way I could escape was to promise to return with a shipload of gay young  beaux who would permit themselves to be loved, petted, and fed on cocoanuts and yams until the end of their days.  "Plea Waar, the warlike Queen of the  forsaken Papuans, is a very remarkable woman. Tall, muscular and of a command- in presence, she would attract attention anywhere. As she is the absolute monarch of all she surveys, including the surround- ing reefs and atolls that are unsurveyed, she would be a great prize for the lucky man who might win her dusky heart and not bloodless hand. Since the disappearance of all the men on the islands her nature has become greatly softened, and she now plues,  as do her maidens, for the presence of the dear departed.  "It was whispered that she had made a  ragout out of one or two of her husbands who had not lived up to her expectations  but no white man need fear any such fate. The St. John's natives acknowledge a lik- ing now and then for a bit of native flesh, done brown, but white man's meat, they say, has such a salty flavor that it is unpalatable.  "One charming characteristic of these women is the absence among them of jeal- ousy. A man may have as many wives as  he wants and be happy with any when the other dear charmers are away. It would be a great place for Mormon missionaries. They might take down there a hundred or  two of the young scions of Zion and estab- lish a branch kingdom in the South seas. The possibilities of such a scheme are be- yond computation. The Queen would ac- cept the Mormons with open arms.  "St. John's group never having been very popular with traders, the women are like the trees and fruit of their island home --- nature's own creations. Like the Samoans and Gilbert islanders, they have well-round- ed forms and are of the temperament that is fostered by the warm sun of the tropics.  "In my opinion, it would really be a pay- ing proposition for a company of benevolent Christians to charter a vessel and send to St. John's a consignment of the unemploy- ed to become husbands for the lonely women of the sea-girt isles. For every husband delivered the Queen would be willing to exchange a ton of cocoanuts or anything else that might be preferred. There is in this proposition a magnificent opportunity to make a fortune that should not be over- looked."  The sailors of the Bonanza are quite as enthusiastic as their Captain over the lone- ly and loving women of the manless Eden  of the South Pacific.  "Say," said one of them, "I never see such a sight, and I've sailed in all the waters on the globe. Why, they just swarmed over the lee rail like a lot of monkeys. And mebbe they ain't hummers! Why, I hope to never go to sea again if I ever see before so much female loveliness all to-  gether at one time. They are mostly wo- men of middle stature, but what they lack in height they make up in development. Why, between you and me, if I could have done it on the quiet, I would have just ma- rooned myself down there on that island and taken a couple of years off to enjoy life.  "There was one of 'em who was a stun- ner, and no mistake. She was just as bright as a dollar, and had big, watery eyes that were just full of love. She was taken with me, I could see that, and I hated to unclasp her arms from my neck and tell her I was an orphan and couldn't marry  without my Captain's consent.  "All they want is mates. That's all. And they ain't proud, neither. If they can't get mates, why, they'll be satisfied with a bos'on, or even a plain ordinary seaman like me. Between you and me, I think they would even take the cook or a landlubber.  "I never saw such a lot of love-sick maidens in all my born days, and I'm no chicken, either. The Captain had to keep an eye to windward, or else he would have lost every man jack of us, I'm thinkin'. It's pretty hard, I tell yer, to have to tell a lov- ing maiden that you can't marry her --- and she with sections of islands to throw into the bargain; but we had to do it. The skipper wouldn't take no nonsense.  "But, say, between me and you, myself and some of the boys are a-goin' back there some day and, if you believe your uncle, if we don't have miles of cocoanuts, and be mighty big chiefs ourselves, why then I'll swallow my kit, that's all."  This story is reminiscent of a portion of that unsurpassed tale of Hermann Melville, a greater Clark Russell whose sea stories of forty years ago are still read with great in- terest by all acquainted with the English tongue. Mr. Melville's description of how the vessel on which he was aboard was be- sieged by the amazons of a South-sea isle is so nearly analagous to the experience of ENDENTRY David Mann Dec. 8 1896 ENDENTRY D.

Price One Penny  FUNERAL SERVICES OF APOSTLE ERASTUS SNOW.  -CONCLUDED FROM PAGE 421.-  Apostle Heber J. Grant said: I am pleased to add my testimony regard- ing Brother Erastus Snow. I know of no man who has labored more faithfully and energetically. None were too insignificant for his notice. He took an interest in all. There is no man whose life is a better example for the youth of Israel. My ideal of an apostle was Erastus Snow. When I was called as an apostle I prayed that the same spirit of self-sacrifice might inspire me. No man can say anything but good of him. He has been a Latter-day Saint in very deed, and has gained an exaltation in the celestial kingdom of God. It was in- tended to read the last sermon he delivered, at a young men's meeting, April 8, 1888, but there is not time. He then said: "The Lord keeps His own counsels in these things, and it is not given to us to know and under- stand the day and the hour when the Son of Man will come; but it is for us always to be prepared, and to so live that we shall be prepared for Him when He does come. And whether we lay down our bodies before the coming of the Son of Man or not it  mattereth not, so that we have filled our days with usefulness, are prepared  to come forth when the trump shall sound and call forth the dead. I do most heartily endorse those senti- ments which have been expressed concerning the dead who die in the Lord. They do not taste of death. It seems to me that there is no death, but they are moving on to life—life eternal." Brother Erastus is moving on to life eternal, and may we follow in his footsteps.  I am requested to read a few words written by Apostle Moses Thatcher.  Erastus Snow is dead! How few, even among Latter-day Saints—how few, indeed, of his immediate associ- ates—comprehended his worth, or fully appreciated his generous, un- selfish disposition.  He was great because he was good. An intellectual giant, yet humble as a child. Now, and in years to come, as questions of magnitude affecting the public weal arise, the void caused by his departure will seem fathomless, as the grief at his loss will be intense.

Sheets May 5 1896 ENDENTRY 2  I have been going to the Brigham Young College for the last three years and have spent all the means I had. We have a good farm, but it is under a mortage. My father is aged and not able to work. All his help (consisting of my two younger brothers) is away from home attend- ing the same college from  which I graduated.  The date at which I am able to go I could not say; but think it is pos- sible to go any time after ENDENTRY would entirely dis- own me. At all events I  would be placed in a po- sition where it would be impossible to carry out my decision. My Wish can consequently be realized only in case the opportun- ity is offered me to do so in the Mormon city. I have, however, no money for such a journey, nor can I obtain any. But if you would have the kindness and make the journey there possible for me, so I would be under everlasting obligation to you. I am writing ENDENTRY ly burdened with accumulated respon- sibilities, how vividly will they sense the taking away of one ever ready— always willing to put a lifting shoulder to the wheel. In the future, when dark clouds of persecution are riven by the fierce lightnings of hate, and wrathful storms beat upon defenseless heads, who can fill the place of Erastus Snow? In times of peace, when the allurements of a deceitful ease threa- tened danger in the path of unsus- pecting youth, who will be able to supplement the wise counsel that hath laid the foundation for many a pros- perous, pure, and patient life? To whom now can the young go for a chart to guide them over life's troubled sea, with the same confident assurance that they have experienced in going to him?  Into what listening ear and sym- pathetic heart shall the troubled now pour their story of distress? Who now will console the forsaken or com- fort the grief-striken, as he has done? The poor came to him freely, and the sick and weary laid their burdens upon his shoulders without hestiation. Who will bear them now?  As the knowledge that Erastus Snow is dead settles into the feelings of the people, the fountains of emo- tion will break forth, and silent tears will moisten many a spot where for hours he has stood patiently listening to piteous tales, while incipient dis- ease sowed the seeds of death in his unshrinking body; for when the sor- rows of others overshadowed him, Erastus Snow was wholly oblivious of self.  Heedless of consequences, he has  stood for hours exposed to the night winds of a Southern desolation, more treacherous than the snows and frosts of a Northern clime. While thus  exposed, thoughtless persons have poured into his sympathetic ears tales of troubles as if his compassionate heart could never fail to respond.  But now he is dead, and the drafts of friends and the demands of enemies must each go to protest. His mortal career is ended. For the cause of his taking away we must search amid the burning sands and gleaming volcanic rocks of Southern Utah, where has been spent the best years of his life. Many a weary night he had sought repose while exhausted nature—sweat- ing at every pore—was chilled by the winds sweeping the cactus plains of Mexico or sighing through the pines of the Sierra Madre. To those who, in their misguided enforcement of the law, have deprived him of the conso- lation and comforts of home, what shall the harvest be? Under trying circumstances he recently endured a  severe operation upon his eyes. Ex- hausted by the pain inflicted, and while trying to rest in a room and bed  to which he was unused, he contracted a severe cold that resulted in his death.  Not long since a brother in deep affliction exclaimed, "I would give more this moment to see Erastus Snow than any man living, for he could tell me what to do in this hour of supreme trial."  Measure his life's work, and how beautiful and perfect in every part it now in the presence of death seems. As husband and father, tender and true, affectionate and just. As friend and brother, devoted and unchange- able. As statesman and scholar, pro- found and farseeing. As defender of constitutional liberty, valiant and con- sistent. As a servant of God, faith- ful, devoted, true. Magnanimous to enemies, generous to friends. Un- swerving in life, trusting and confident in death. Such was Erastus Snow. Let the fingers of fame weave garlands with which to entwine the brow of battle-begrimmed heroes! Let ambi- tion sing from monumental piles the  praises of those who in life wrought  carnage and death; but for us, we will keep fresh in our hearts the memory of the good and true whose mission was devoted to life, not death.  He has left us to join those gone before. Let us emulate his works, follow his example, and when thrones shall totter and kingdoms fall, joy- fully in his mansion home shall greet him "wives, children, and friends."

It has also been my privilege to mingle with him in councils, and in such places as try men's souls. I have  never known him for one moment to doubt or hesitate in regard to the work God had imposed upon him. In his home, gentle and affectionate; pru- dent in his exmple; consistent and wise in his language; loving and kind, and as just as God has made mortal man. In traveling with him I have often wondered at the inspiration which guided him, especially in talk- ing to the young. His words of coun- sel fell in the kindest accents; his rebukes were administered in fearless- ness, and were followed by kindess. He possessed a judicial mind, and had he followed the profession of the law none would have excelled him for the greatness of his decisions. God was with him. I have seen His power manifest in him. Brother Erastus has worthily performed the labors of an apostle. He was among the fore- most in toil, usually working till the early hours of the morning. When it was found necessary to settle the de- sert soil of Southern Utah, Erastus Snow was called, and faltered not in the midst of difficulty. Frequently, when his body was racked with pain, he would go into the fields and coun- sel with the people. He was also father of the settlements in Arizona. There is no tribute that is not due to Erastus Snow. As a preacher of the Gospel, he was eloquent; as a colon- izer, true; as a legislator, wise; as a councilor, fearless; as a friend, un- swerving; as a father, unexcelled in love and integrity. I have looked  upon him as one of the brightest of earth's sons, and, had he remained in his native State, he would have shone in the councils of the nation. May  the blessings of heaven rest on his numerous family, and may we say of  them, they were worthy descendants of a noble sire, who was devoted to the work of God.  Apostle Smith then read the fol- lowing letter from President Wilford Woodruff:  Beloved Brethren and Sisters, Once again, in the providences of the Almighty, Israel mourns the loss of one of its mightiest sons. Death sel- dom comes at a time we deem oppor- tune; and if we, in our blindess, were permitted to judge, we should certainly decide that the present, with its trials, its perplexities, and its sor- rows, is no time to take from our  midst men of counsel, of wisdom, of faith, and of judgment, such as was  our beloved brother, Elder Erastus Snow, whose obsequies we this day solemnize. But He who doeth all things well has been pleased to take to Himself His servant, and we can simply bow the head and acknowledge His hand in all things, and with one of old exclaim: "The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away; blessed be the name of the Lord."  The peculiarities of our position prevent us from personally joining with you in this tribute of respect to our departed, and now sanctified, brother, whose departure from this mortal sphere has doubtless been hastened by the same causes that pre- vent us from joining you on this sad occasion. This enforced absence we sincerely regret, as we should have found a mournful satisfaction in add- ing our testimony to that of our brethren, touching the virtues, the in- tegrity, the zeal, the whole-hearted- ness, of our friend and co-labourer who has passed before us into the joys of eternity. For him we have  no cause to mourn; he has fought the good fight, he has finished his work, he has been true and faithful, and is now entering into that fairer and better world, the bliss of which the heart cannot conceive nor the natural  eye see, but the glories of which, by  reason of his obedience and devotion to God and His laws, had been sealed upon him through sacred ordinances and by the Holy Spirit of Promise while he yet tabernacled in mortality. May our end be like his.  The name of Erastus Snow will never be forgotten in the history of the Church of Christ. From early youth to his latest day he was ever found in the unflinching performance of his duties as a servant of the Most High. Without exaggeration it can be said of him that he died with the harness on. In every position he was called to fill—and they were many— he exhibited those nobler traits which ENDENTRY Newsom's Improvement in Irigation ELI NEWSOM, Inventor.

If we view him as a missionary of the Gospel of peace, as a legislator for the people of God, as a pioneer, convert- ing the wilderness into the fruitful field, as an apostle in the councils of the Church, we everywhere find him a man of no ordinary type, but one whose ability and strength of character marked him as a leader among men, even where great men were not lacking. It would be diffi- cult for us to pick out any one special department of life and say in this he most particularly shone, or select some other and assert in that he was most eminent. He was great in all.  To the sons and daughters of Scan- dinavia he was perhaps greater as a missionary—the first apostle who bore the glad tidings of the Gospel to their fatherland. To the weary toiler be- neath the sultry sun of Southern Utah he was best known as the indefatig- able leader, who planned, devised, con- trived and arranged for their progress and made prosperity possible in one of the most arid, most forbidding regions of this great continent. His prudence, his wisdom, his foresight, are admitted by all—as a counselor he had few peers. His ripe experience, joined with his sound judgment, gave a weight to his words and a strength to his counsels that all who heard felt. Moreover, he possessed, unclouded by stain, those two great virtues that give a man power with the heavens— integrity and purity of character. Let a man possess these, let his heart be true and unflinching, let his life be pure, and, if we add to these humility, he is proof against a multitude of weaknesses and can resist a host of temptations. We all have our weak- nesses; God has permitted them that we might be taught humility in our- selves and charity towards others.  We none of us are perfect whilst we dwell in the flesh; but the man who in humble reliance upon God never falters in the fight for the right, never wavers in his allegiance to the truth, and ever maintains inviolate his covenants, is one whom we can all pause to admire, and strive, by heaven's help, to imitate. Such men are few when compared with the un- numbered hosts who have peopled this earth of ours; but we thank God that we do find them more abundantly  in the midst of the Saints, holding the Holy Priesthood and ministering in things the most sacred ever be- stowed upon humanity. Among these, in the front ranks, is our esteemed brother whose mortal remains are about to be consigned to the tomb.  For nearly forty years Brother Snow has been one of the twelve apostles of the Lord Jesus. To this calling he has given the strength of his prime and the wisdom of his later years. It  has been during this period that he has performed a very large portion of his missionary, legislative and pioneer services. We shall sadly miss him in the quorum with which he has been so long identified, and of which he was at the time of his death one of the oldest members. We shall miss his mature consideration, his deliberate thoughts, his experienced advice—all most needful at a time when the powers of evil are assailing us in so many directions. But we thank the Lord that though from time to time He takes from us those who, as men, we trust most fondly, yet He leaves us not entirely to ourselves, but con- tinues unto us the signs of His ap- proval. We are comforted with the  assurance that this is His kingdom, and that He rules in the heavens and upon the earth; and that from the fall of a sparrow to the death of an apostle all is known unto Him, and nothing happens without His sanction.  And further, brethren and sisters, are we not the sons and daughters of God, and when he shall appear, if we are faithful, shall we not be like him? Yes; and when the glorious day ar- rives we shall once more have the privilege of standing upon this earth and meeting in joy and thanksgiving, not only our brother who has just left us, but Brigham, and thousands of others who have washed their robes white in the blood of the Lamb, and who, through the merits of His atonement, are anointed kings and priests unto God, and with Him reign exalted in His kingdom.

Ever since, at verious times, there has been two spirits at work with me: the one prompting me to write to you, and the other saying, it is nonsense and  folly. I now feel that there can be no harm at least, and that the Lord brings about good results by very small means.

Nalder Nov. 22 1896 ENDENTRY In the year 1868 my father received his second anointing, and in about three week he died. About two years afterward, I dreamed father came to me while I was in bed, the house was lit up like day: he talked to me for some time, telling, which seems to me, things that were coming to pass, and things which I should do. After his conversation with me, he went out of the house, and I awoke or come to my self, for it seemed that I had not been asleep. There was considerable light in the house, I arose up and looked out of the window and saw the hills and mountains very plain and thought it was day light, as the moon give no light at that time, as it was near the new moon. I started to dress, when the thought came to me to think it all over, and I would be better able to tell mother, just as it was given me. I placed my elbow on the pillow and my hand over my eyes while I thought it over. Then I went to get up and found the room in darkness: it scared me so, that every thing father had said, was taken from me.  ENDENTRY Frank Cole Jan. 30 1896 ENDENTRY Frank M.

ENDENTRY That every thing he said should be taken from me makes it seem remarkable. About a year after  that, I dreamed father came to me, he stood in the air above the ground, I thought it was his spirit. He asked me if I would finish his house, He then invited me to come and see what needed to be done. I went with him, and saw a large frame building standing on a solid rock foundation, but it needed the shingles, weather boarding, windows and doors. He asked me if I would finish it. I told Him I would. He then said:  "I am going away to be gone a long time before I come again to talk to  you." He than started up into heaven and continued untill he went out of my sight. I then awoke and found it to be a dream. It has now been about Twenty Five years since, and ^I^ have had no talk with him, in dream, which makes it seem the more remarkable.
