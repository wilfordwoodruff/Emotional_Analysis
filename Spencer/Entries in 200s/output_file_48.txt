 OFFICE of  THE UTAH SUGAR CO.,    Lehi City, Utah,  March 21 1891    President Wilford Woodruff.    Dear Brother    I would respectfully  suggest that Bro Hyrum Kirkham, one of 4  Young men whose names were sent from  England, as being suitable to go there on  Missions, & who all cherefally responded  as being willing to go, be released for a  few months fore the following reasons.  His father in law Bro William Warlaos  has just died leaving a wife who has been  bedfast with a Cancer in the face & who  cannot possibly recover & is a great Care  on the family left. Nearly her sole dependence  in the Male line is Bro Hyrum, & if he  now goes it will be a great hardship,  but as soon as Bro James Esano returns  who is now the Prest of the Sheffield Conference  & who also is a son in law. Bro Hyrum  could go in peace. Bro F Armstrong  who is a friend to the family & was  here at the funeral today will be 
 OFFICE of    THE UTAH SUGAR CO.,    Lehi City, Utah April 24th, 1891.    President Wilford Woodruff,  Salt Lake City.    Dear Brother:    You may possible remember that on the last day of  Cenference a brother from this town named Henry Lewis stepped up  to the stand and spoke to you about his wife being sick, his name  had been proposed as a missionary by the Liverpool office as a  young man who would made a good missionary to the British Isles;  he is one of our steadiest and best hands working on the Sugar  Factory, and he had agreed when Lehi made up its subscription  list for stock in the fFactory to put in $500.00, when he was called  on this mission he had already paid $250.00 and he came to me and  told me that if he could sell that stock that he had already paid  and be realeased also from that, that he had agreed to pay that he  would have enough means to go with, and his family could live in  his absence. I told him that if he was really called that we  would do our best to pay him the $250.00 that he had already paid.    His wife is now much better and he is ready to go in about  two weeks if he is required to go, but I was quoting his case in  the Directors met^e^ting in Brother James Jack's office on Tuesday  evening last merely to show the difficulties that some times we  have to contend against. wWhere people have agreed to take stock  in the Factory and failed for some cause or other. It is va very  tight time just now andd to be candid it is going to cripple us in  this town to a certain extent both to part with him and also to  have to pay him the money as we are having a very hard pull to  do as we have agreed to, on account of lacks of funds amongst the  people.    Bros. Thatcher & Grant who were at the Directors meeting felt  that he ought to be released, and while I feel very delicate in  asking such favors still I desire to present the case before you  and if you could release him under these circumstances it would  be a great favor to Lehi. I will say that he does not know any-  thing of this letter. He is also one of the liveliest men we have  got in collecting means for the Defence fund, and though I also ^but^  claim that I take pride in sending some of the most useful men we  have from this Ward as missionaries. We have already four in the  European mission and who are some of our best men. Those that were  excused a short time ago are all gone with the exception of one,  and he is making preparation to go next fall.    I remain, very truly your brother in the Gospel,  Thomas. R.

Dear Sir;    I a confirmed invalid  have commenced to write a conpendious history  of Christianity and wishing to be well informed in  regard to the history of the Mormons I address you  hoping you will be kind enough to furnish me  with the information I desire. I have read your  early history and know little about your society  since the death of your founder, Joseph Smith.    If you liked you could write me a short  account of your religion from its foundation;  but in any event please be kind enough to give me  your history since the death of Mr. Smith, and  also define your creed or belief, together, with  some details in regard to your form of worship  or religious exercises.    I, of course, do not wish to misrepresent your society  in any way and it would therefore be better if you  would write me some details of your history and  creed from beginning to the present time.

 Feb. 22nd 1889    Dr. Jos. S. Richards.  Salt Lake City, Utah    Dear Brother Joseph: yours of the 11th inst. is Just rec'd  and I hasten to reply. It is not necessary for me  to make a long story about the matter of your claim  to the purchase of that piece of land.    I consider a bargain a bargain, and in  all honesty and fairness the bargain which was  made between you and Bp. Hunter should  have been conplied with, and carried out;  and that it was not, always did seem to me  arbitrary and unjust to you.    I did all I could to provail upon Prest. Tay-  lor to let you have the land as agreed be-  tween Bp. Hunter and yourself, and while  he never to my knowledge refused to do so,  he persisted in putting it off and never, so  far as I know, came to any conclusion  about it. I have felt very sorry and  chigrinned over it, to think that when the  agreement was made in good faith, that any one  should hesitate, or stand in the way of its  fulfillment. You shall have my goodwill  and my vote in the council, (if I can be  there and otherwise you can use this.) where    (see over.)

 Ephraim, Decbr 20th1889.    President W. Woodruff  and Councilors.    Beloved Brethren!    I received your telegraphic dispatch  very late this evening and at once pro-  ceed to reply. The Scenes of "Early Church  History" which I have, are painted on can-  vas (12 + 7 1/2 foot each) and I can therefore  not send them. I have only two printed  pictures: "Joseph Smith receiving the plates  from the Angel Moroni" and "The Restoration  of the Aaronic Priesthood," which I can  send you by mail on Monday, if so  desired, as ^but^ it is too late to-night.    But now, my beloved brethren, this  your proposition gives me much anxiety  and distress of mind, as it appears to me,  that what you thus intend to do, is virtually  taking the main support away from me  and my family, and that too, at a time,  when I badly can afford it.    I have lately returned from a mission,  in which I have employed my means and  abilities for the benefit of the Church, and I  find, that the crops in this valley have failed,  leaving us in a very poor fix. Besides  this I expect to be inside of prison-walls  for some time the coming season; my house  is morgaged and I have, of neccessity given

Richards, requesting me  to express my view to you in regard to his  right to the purchase of a small piece of  land situated just back of, and near  the Museum.  You will no doubt recoll-  ect that I have mentioned the matter  several times to you and to the Council  in the hope that Dr. Joseph's claims upon  it by reason of an understanding and  agreement had between Bp. Edward Hunter  and himself, would be acknowledged  and respected to the extent, at least, of  his having the option on it when it should  be sold.  I am aware of the fact that this  property is not now in your hands. it  having passed into the hands of the Scientific  and Literary Association, but it has not,  perhaps, passed beyond your influence  in the matter of counsel and advise as  to what what is right and proper; and

On this I paid some since I  returned, but at a great sacrifice of my fami-  lies comfort, as they stand in need of many  things which they can not get now. I have  not even the means to pay for the R. R. Fare,  or else I would come down and lay this  matter before you.

So far as my  personal knowledge of the matter is  concerned, I have been convinced from  the start that there was a fair and square  bargain made between Bp. E. Hunter  and J. S. Richards in regard to that piece  of land; but when it came before Prest.  Taylor for settlement, as pr. the agreement  with Bp Hunter, Prest. Taylor delayed  and postponed the matter until circumstances  changed and it became apparent to me  it was no use pressing him further in regard  to it.  I then advised Dr. Richards to  wait awhile until a more favorable  time should come, and I believed then  he would get the land.  I think a bargain  is a bargain, and it should be respected.  If Bp. Hunter had no right to make  a bargain with Dr. Richards, then both  the Bp. and Dr. R. were laboring under  a mistake.  I am fully persuaded that  Bp. Hunter made the agreement to let Dr

 Richards have the land for the same price  in cash that it was turned in for on  tithing. At that time money was an  object and land was not so much sought  for, and that Bp. Hunter made the agreement  at all, is proof that he did it in good faith  and I never could tell why it was not,  or ought not to be carried out in good faith.    The only reason I could give why it  was not done is that Prest. Taylor had a  habit of putting off almost everything  of this kind indefinitely. I do not think Dr  Richards has been dealt with fairly in the  matter, not that I blame any body, I  simply charge it to Prest. Taylor's habit of  procrastination. I spoke to him many  times about it, and while he never  denied Joseph's claims or refused to [ace-  sed] to them, he persisted in putting it off  until I advised the Dr. to wait till some  more favorable time. I believe a bargain  made by Bp. Hunter is entitled to the respect  of the counsil, and should not be ignored.    I believe Dr. Joseph's claim to the right to purch  ase that piece of land is just and should be  respected. I do not believe it is consistent

 MANUAL TRAINING SCHOOL:    Some of our most responsible and representative men  have for some time been considering the beniefits to be derived from a   school of manual training, and the advisability of opening an Acad[e]my of   this kind, for the [e]ducation of young men in the practical branches  of the mechanical arts.    It is an apparent fact that not enough of the youth of Utah are adopt-  in[g] the mechanical trades as a [me]ans of livelihood, and as a consequence  mechanics from other parts of the Country are filling the places that   could and should be occupied by our own people; which condition of af-  fairs has been viewed with apprehension by some of those who have the  material interests of th[e] people of our Territory most at heart, and a  remedy has been studied by them; the outgrowth of which is the contemp-  lated opening of such an Academy as above referred to, with a Capital  stock of $200,000.00 divided into 4000 shares of the par value of $50.0[0]  per share.    It is hoped that all who are interested in the best advancement of our  young people will subscribe for enough of the stock in said contemplat[e]d  Company to effect an incorporation at once.    As soon as ten (10) per cent of the stock has been subscribed a meeting  will be called and officers elected.

Wilford Woodruff,  Salt Lake City.    Dear Brother: Replying to your  letter by Geo. Reynolds, Esq. dated Dec. 8th 1890, will  say that Prest. C. D. Fjeldsted have frequently  spoken with me in regard to a mission to  Scandinavia; and in our last conversation  I agreed to be on hand at any time  when wanted; but as the early spring  & summer gives me most profitable employment  I prefered to stay untill after midsummer.  I concluded this arrangement, or talk, answered  yours of date named; but from recent information  I find out it did not, hence this writing.  I am still of the same mind as I expressed  to Bro. Fjeldsted, and as much interested  in the Cause of Truth as ever. Financially I am  a little better prepared. If my services are wanted  in the near future I would be pleased to know the time  so I could work to that end.    Your Brother in the Gospel  I. C. Thoresen    See over.
