 OFFICE OF  Presidency Utah Stake of Zion.  Provo City, Utah, 3/19 1893  Pres. Wilford Woodruff  Salt Lake City,  Dear Brother;  I am directed by my father  to inform you as to the condition of his health.  For three days preceeding last evening he was improving  in health very satisfactorly, but while bathing last night  about 9 o'clock, in getting out of the bath-tub his feet  sliped from under him causing him to fall with full  weight upon the edge of the tub, causing a slight fracture  of two of his ribbs on the left side immediately over the heart, from which he has suffered last night and today consid- erable pain, though he is in as favorable a condition as  could be expected under the circumstances. We anticipate  no serious results from the accident and expect him to  be around again in a week or so if nothing unforseen developes in the mean-time.  Trusting you are in your usual good health, with  regards from father and family I am  Your brother in the Gospel A. O. Smoot Jr. 
 OFFICE OF  Presidency Utah Stake of Zion.  Provo City, Utah, Feb. 21 1893  Pres. Wilford Woodruff, Salt Lake City,  Dear Brother;  My father desires me to inform  you of the condition of his health at present.  He has been confined to his room for the last twelve  days, the result, I think, of a cold he contracted while in  Salt Lake two weeks ago today. He has been able to sit  up more or less every day, but has suffered greatly  through inaction of the stomack and frequent spells  of faintness, which have caused him to grow gradyuly weaker and rendered it impossible for him to get  refreshing sleep. Yesterday and today, however, he seems  somewhat improved, having slept fairly well for the  last two nights, and he has today eaten two very fair  meals for him without experiencing any distress as  a concequence.  As per his request I will keep you posted from time  to time as to his condition.  With kindest regards, I remain  Your Brother in the Gospel A. O. Smoot Jr. 
 496 Elm street  New Haven Connecticut  August second ninety four  Mr Wilford Woodruff.  President of the Mormon Church.  Dear Sir  May I introduce to  your far-away self, a grand-daughter of  Mr Ozem Woodruff. (formerly of Avon)  Tis many years since, he joined the  majority. To the imaginative mind  Heaven, must, in deed, be a large city.  Opinions differ so radically, one finds it  difficult, to decide, as to the possible  destination, of those-gone before.  Two years since, I passed a number  of works, with my dear Auntie, Mrs  Linn Woodruff Hatch in her pleasant  West Avon-home. I became quite, 
 interested in you, and your, church work,  through letters to her, as well, as the  photographs of your old home, together,  with other places of historic note.  The photgraph of your self, I am sure  must be, a faithful, representation  of your kindly, face.  A recent issue of the "Boston Post"  (Boston Mass) gave a print of the govrnor  of Utah, and a librl, of you, (ie) if your  photograph is correct. Also a brief sketch  of your personal affairs. The (Posts) article  suggested, the thought, why not take up  the acquantance. Aunt Linn, enjoyed so  much, I cannot hope, to make her place  good, for she was a veritable "Dorcas"  However, I will do the best I can.  (Considering the facts in life, thats about  all any one, can do). If, you have  sufficient interest, in-a good-many-times- 
 -removed-cousin, to reply. I should be very,  glad to hear, from you, providing, you  send a hand-written, answer.  Connecticut people, are such hustlers  they, do not have time, to show, common  courtesy. (even to strangers) No matter how,  private the business may be, one, wishes  to transact, with, these, educated, gentlemen  a-dictated-type-written letter is received,  whose brevity may represent, the "soul of  wit," at the same time, makes one feel  as if, they had been immersed, in an  orthodox, Babtist, tank-in-midwinter. I am  not collecting autographs, but democratic  facts, instead, are you, a politician?  Grandpapa, was a life-long-democrat. When he was on earth, I called him  Grandpa that wont do, for-94-so, we  spell it with a small g, and two, p-as Were it not strictly, against, my principle  to apologize, I should feel, that I ought  so to do, for the length of this 
 introduction. Considering the number  of, generations we, must wade through  to prove the claim of relationship. I am  sure, the explanation, is sufficient.  Most respectfully yours  Nelly, Woodruff-Thomas  Address,  Mrs. A. E. W. Thomas  #496 Elm Street  New Haven Connecticut. 
 Saint Louis  Sept 25 1856  Hon W Woodruff  Dear Brother  I am happy to acknowledge  the receipt of your regulurly Communication  from the "Historians Office" designed for  "The Luminary."  They have not yet  found their way to their rightful des- tination from the fact that I have not  yet been able to recommece its publication  but they have afforded me much interest  and pleasure in perusal, and I trust  to be still favored with your valuable  Correspendence. And when I recommence the Louminary, which I expect will be  in a few weeks. Your Communication's will find a distinguished position, &  will doubtless be appreciated by my  subscribers.  You will have learned by my  letter to Gov Young that I was unable  to get up the New Deseret Type early  enough to send across the plains this  fall, but there is one Item I wish  to call your attention to -- and through  you that of the Board of Regents --  that is, what letters in the 
 alphabet will be most used in  printing?  And what will be the proportional excess of those most  in demand?  It is very important  that this should be Considered  and determined as soon as possible  so as to enable me fill the order  satisfactorily -- or so as to get a Complete  font of type.  I have been fvery much occupied  with business since my return to the  States -- on my arrival I had scercily  time to look around me before I  found it necessary to visit New York  Boston Washington -- and I  have within the last few days returned  from Atchison & Florence where  I have been some several weeks  Brother George A is still East  but I expect him in a few days.

No Elder in the Church has more cause  for Humility and Thankfulness towards  our Heavenly Father than your correspond- ent.

 OFFICE OF  The First Presidency of the  Church of Jesus Christ  of  Latter-day Saints.  P. O. Box. B.  Salt Lake City, Utah ^Soda Springs, Idaho,^ Sept. 2nd[18]97.  President W. Woodruff, My dear Brother Wilford:  I am glad to hear of your  good health.  I am informed that you con- tinue to improve.  This is very gratifying news. I read your discourse, delivered on Sunday  with the utmost pleasure.  I am sure it will  be greatly appreciated by the Saints, as it is  a powrful testimony, and especially so coming  from you under the circumstances.  The Lord  be praised for giving you the strength and  Spirit which you had.  My regret is that I  was not with you; but you had, and always  have, my faith and prayers.  I thank the Lord  that I live when you do, and that I have been,  and am, so closely associated with you.  It is  one of the great joys of my life to be your fellow- apostle and one of your counselors.  I feel the  Lord has been very kind to me in granting me this  happiness, and I trust I shall never prove unworthy of  it.  My hoarseness still continues; but I  think my health has improved.  I hope to be back by  the morning of the 9th at the latest.  Accept my love, my dear President, and give it to Bro. Joseph F.  I am Your loving Brother, Geo. Q. Cannon 
 W. DERBY JOHNSON, JR.^George Teasdale,^ COLONIA DIAZ,  CANTON GALEANA, CHIHUAHUA, - MEXICO.  Personal  Colonia Diaz, July 5th 1891  Dear President Woodruff:  There being no Sabbath school this  morning I sit down to have another quiet chat with you. Our  circumstances are more comfortable than they have been. We lived  in a room 11x14 for some time. Then we bought the house consisting of two  rooms. The other room was 14x15 ft 6 in. When we obtained these two rooms  we felt we could breathe more freely. But when the summer came and we were cooking in this larger room, it was so hot that we  were being cooked with our food. The advent of Tilley and her  boys necessitated more room. Se we built a kitchen and bedroom on to our house of two rooms and now we are very comfortable But building in Mexico is an expensive luxury if one has the common necessities to produce light and air. In the Mex- ican houses they have adobie walls, mud roof, doors and   window shutters. Very little if any glass. I think I have  discovered why. Three windows cost in Deming $4.25 four dollars and twenty five cents. They weighed (58) fiftyeight pounds. The cost  for duties was $7.90 freight 58  Papers 80  total $9.28. A suit  of furniture Bed stead ^& wire mattrass^ Bureau, wash stand, 9 chairs & a childs chaircast $44.25 The duties were $227.2065. Freight $3.95 Papers & stamps $300 = Total $34.50 The first cost is in U. S. Currency. The second in Mexican Silver, which would  make the windows and furniture rather costly and necessitate  sustaining home manufacture. Building is expensive. Lum- ber is selling at Diaz $42.50 per (1000) thousand feet Mexican silver. 
 Etty and the children have gone to Juarez on a visit. Jenny  & Georgey were recovering from the whooping cough and I  thought a change of air would help them as they had run  down considerable. We are having quite a warm time. The  sun shines nearly all the time and the heat is very  oppressive. Yesterday was the 4th of July. We had no public  demonstration. We have only a few men at home. So many  on the railway and away freighting. Those who have  stayed at home are doing well. Their crops look well  and their trees growing. I think in the outcome those who  stay at home will be the gainers. We ^have^ had new potatoes  corn, beans, and peas already. Meat is scarce, although we  have some stock men who seem to think they are rich in cattle, but that is all. Very seldom kill any. Not  that we need meat. If we had it we would have to cook  and eat it or it would soon spoil. Our Fast Meeting was  well attended. It is almost like Sunday on Fast Day. In  the afternoon the Sisters of the Relief Society meet, and  we have a good Relief Society, some of the brethren generally  meet with them. In the evening we have a conjoint meet- ing of the Young Mens & Womens Mutual Improvement Association All meetings well attended and very interesting. The  Saints feel well and we take our schooling and exper- ience as well as we can. We have some disagreeble things to meet sometimes, and some get discouraged &  leave us. They do not give the Mexican Mission a very  flattering report. But those who stay seem contented  and happy. They trust in the Lord and seek His counsel. This class are contented to remain. The health of the colo- ny is improving. We hope soon to resume our Sabbath  schools & Primaries. It is wonderful of so many sick how few  comparatively speaking have died. I have had good help in our 
 Marshall Gleason came from Utah and  picked up Allsworth at Deming. I made  inquiries about him when I went to Doublan  where he lived and found the Presiding Elder  Bro. Jones knoew all about them. They were not  colonists ^n^or received as members of that branch. Monday, July 6th 1891 Last night we held a Priesthood  meeting and it was determined D.V. to resume our  Sabbath Schools next Sabbath. Health of the Colony improving. I anticipate going shortly to make  another visit to the settlements and organizing  at ward at Doublan. They are suffering for  want of an organization. Things generally are  improving. We have no trouble. The worst man  represented here by reports Bro W. W. Galbraith said to me not very long ago "President  Teasdale, anything I have, you want, if you  will only let me know, I shall be pleased  to let you have it" from what I heard of  Bro Galbraith, I would naturally expect to  have had some trouble with him, but he  and his family have treated me with kindness  and respect. Instead of pushing him off or  treating him with coldness & contempt, I have quietly labored  with him & preached the gospel. You thought he might  be made a useful member of the community and  you were right in your impression. We all have our  peculiar individuality and the Lord has brought  us into His fold, peculiar though we may be, and gen- erally, the worst of us, can be handled with kindness  and consideration, can't we? God bless you, my beloved  brother. With kind love to you & yours I am as ever affectionately your brother  We all join in kind love to you & aunt Emma.  George 
 Patriarch Bro B. F. Johnson. We have been together  administring to the sick &c. He is a spiritually  minded man and has the spirit of his call- ing. His early association with the prophet  Joseph and knowledge of principle makes him  an interesting companion. He is a blessing to this  colony. How glad we should be to have a visit  from you. We could take care of you and Aunt Emma if she was with you and you could  have a rest here. The road between here and  Deming is not so bad. You would only  need to be out one night and then you could  sleep in a tent. The best rig in the place  would be at your service and willing  hands to take the best of care of you. And  how the children and young people would  delight to see and hear you. If you did  not like to travel in the heat of the day you  could choose a bright moonlight, as we  do sometimes and travel in the cool of  the evening and early morning and  take a nap in the day time a'la Mexican for that is the way they travel. We shall soon  have what they call the rainy season, which  generally follows this severe heat. There was a man & family here called Allsworth who  had the credit of seducing and running away  with his neice his brothers daughter. When  last I went to Juarez I passed him as he was  going out to Deming. Now comes the word that  [sideways text] Geo Teasdale July 5 [18]91 Answd July 30 [18]91 [end of sideways text]

 Wilford Woodruff Esq. My Dear Sir,  Your kind  favor of the 31st of July has been received. I am greatly obliged to you for your  kindness to my family. I have notified  brother Hautz of my intention to relinquish  my interest in the mill agreeably to the  deed or contract, which requires him to  refund to me the amount paid him. This  was a proposal of his own when I made  the purchase, if the concern should not  prove satisfactory. If however you can  get some more pork from him this fall you will oblige me by doing so, for this  is a separate affair, and he still owes  me considerable pork. Congress finally  adjourned on the 30th ultimo. I am now in  the country where I shall remain until November, and then visit New York before  I return to Washington. Very truly Yours John M.

Woodruff St. George   Dear Brother:  Your letter of 27th inst. from Nephi, "desiring my attendance" at the Conference of the Y. M. M. I. Associations at Ogden on Sunday last, came duly to hand. Agreeable to your request I made arrangements for Bros. D. B. Wells and C. W. Penrose to attend the Tooele Con- ference, and I went to Ogden and attended the young peoples Conference. There was a large attendance, the house being completely filled. We had a very interesting time so far as the meetings were concerned. The morning was occupied by reports and short lectures from various young men, on the subjects of the "Organiza- tion of the Church," "The Miracles of Jesus," "The Constitu- tion of the U. S." and the "Divine origin of the Book of Morm- on." The afternoon was occupied by administering the Sacrement, sustaining the authorities of the Associ ations, and a discourse by myself. So far so good, and I think you will accord with me in this, but now comes the subject which is the cause 
 [upside-down text] See "Suggestions of the Apostles." &c. Contributor, of May 1880 page 191. [end of upside-down text]  of this writing. In your letter of instructions you say, "I think it desirable if you could consult with the Presidency of  the Stake and appoint a good man, one that would meet with the approval of the Societies and be sustained by them to fill the position" vacated by Jos. A. West. Agreeable to this instruction I "consulted with the Presidency," and to my surprise and disappointment I found they were not united and had never consulted together on this subject. The counsellors claimed that they had been ignored and slighted and the feeling ran high, and extended back to times past and other things. I found it impossible to reconcile them or to come to any agreement in the time which we had, and the only thing I could do was to propose a postponement of the consideration of the subject until some future time. Bro. Peery was eager for me to make the nomination myself and put it through. This I considered unreasonable and unfair besides being entirely opposed to the written instructions on this point, so I ref- used to do it. And told him I did not propose to carry his burdens for him. The instructions upon this matter, so far as I can recall them to memory ^is^ for the "Presidency of the Stake to appoint the Stake Presidents of the Associations subject to the approval of the High Council." ^&c.^ This had not been done I therefore declined to do anything in the premises, and ad- vised the Presidency to go to work and carry out this rule.

[upside-down text] (Our reporter has made Applycation to publish it in pamphlet form) [end of upside-down text]  President Wilford Woodruff:  Dear Brother:  I have, in connection with thousands of the  Latter-day Saints, read with great delight your  discourse delivered at the Weber Stake Conference,  Ogden, October 19, 1896, and published in the Deseret  Semi-Weekly News of November 3, last.  For some  time after its publication your discourse was the  chief topic of conversation among the Saints; it  was also read in some of the ward meetings.  Many with whom I conversed upon the subject ex- pressed a desire to see the discourse printed  in pamphlet form, that they might be the better  able to preserve it.  Now, my object in writing  is to ascertain if you would have any objection to  your discourse being printed in a neat,  pamphlet form, exactly as it appeared in the  Deseret Semi-Weekly News.  If not, it would give  me pleasure to print the pamphlet.  Awaiting your reply, I remain, dear Brother, your fellow-servant in the Gospel of Christ  William A. Morton.  278 C. Street Salt Lake City.

 April 18th 1845, 36 Chapel Street Liverpool  Father & Mother Woodruff  Having an opportunity of Forwarding a letter by private conveyance to the United States by an Elder who is about to Sail to Boston, I thought I would drop a few lines to you, to let you know that we are in the land of the living & in the enjoyment of good health. I have felt vary anxious to hear from you since we have been here but have not as yet herd a word from you or about you since we left New York and at that time you was in sumthing of an unsettled state in your temporal affairs, I suppose you would like to know sumthing what I am doing in this Land. I will therefore say that I have had more business on hand since my arival here than at any one time During life I found the Saints needed in much council & many after alterations through various portions of the British dominions. I have taken a tour through Scotland & a part of England since I came I have held many conferences since I came we held our general conference at Manchester on 6th April it lasted th[r]ee & a half days & more business done than ever before in any one conference in England their was represented on that occasion ten thousand saints save 90, in England, Scotland, Ireland & Wales & incliding their families would probably amount to 30,000 souls  We had a large congregation to leav these chirches represe- nted, & [illegible] the business of leaving the churches represented, & appointing the Elders to take charge of them and attending to the business that necessarily has to be done at such conferences  We established a joint stock company for the purpose of Establishing manufactories in Nauvoo the whole stock 
 is divided into sixty thousand stores making a Capitol of one hundred & fifty thousand Dollars the way the stores are now selling it will be but a little time before the Stock will be taken up. This will be a great help in building up Nauvoo in esstablishing business in cotton & wool & iron trade & employing the poor in that place, we had done this in order to [concentrate] the wealth through & union of the Saints in this land with the Saints in America, save one taking as high as 100 Stores, I have just received letters & papers from Nauvoo all bearing good News they have commanced building the dam on the Mississippi River I am con[?] on the Emigration Business, printing, Temple Tything, & Having the presidency of the ten thousand Saints gives me a plenty of suply  I am now providing 3000 Doctrine & Covenenants which will readily sell as soon as out of press as their is great call for them in this land, we shall emigrate the families via New York & Boston During the summer months I have not yet received any letters from Br Webster nor heard from him ownly as I see his name in the Neighbor as a letter from Father Carter a few days since who informed me that they were all ^well^ that Sister Foss family who were so very sick when we were there had all got well again, & our little Phebe was very well, I was glad to hear from them. My health is very good, which is the case with our home though I have heard some time I came I have had one journey through Scotland & I intend to visit London & France soon, But among the Signs of the times a dark war cloud is appearing over England & America there has never appeared as great a project for it is believed the two countries since peace was proclaimed as at the present time. Sir Robert Peel has taken a strong stance against Mr.  Polk speach on the Oregon question. Either Sir Robert Peel or Mr. Polk must recall what they have said or at least not attempt to carry their missions into operation if no 
 their will assuredly be war, & knowing the minds of both governments I do not believe they will either of them yield the point, great excitement prevails here upon the subject. England is making great preparation for it 16,000 troops have been ordered to embark for Canida. As I was coming home from the office to day I saw hand Bills through the street headed in large letters War War with America the last steem ship was Delaid by parliment to take a messenger from London to Washington. I expect it will be decided I expect in a short time, if war is proclaimed I shall probably leave for America. I believe the day is not far Distant when the American people will have sumthing to do besides fighting the Latter Day Saints I believe the Nation is rife for judgment & a Scourge awaits her. Please write me a letter as soon as you get this & tell me how things are with you how you get along & all the news will you [torn page] And any Newes you may have from Br[other] [torn page] Webster & family Azmon & family, Thompson, Br[other] [Ozam] & fa[mily] [torn page] Sister Cossett & Betsey, or any other friends I would be glad to [hear] [torn page] from give my respects to all who inquire after me I felt anxious to learn from Father Woodruff in consquence of some dreams I had about him I was afraid he was sick or in some trouble. As to myself I all still a [illegible] as it were in Mormonism for it is my life meet & drink and I do not expect to be any thing els but a Mormon either in life or Death. I have never felt as great a responsibility resting upon me as at the present time and when I consider it it certainly looks like a marvelous work & a wonder that an obscure unlearned Miller should stand in England at the head of ten thousand saints, chartering Ships to gather them to this land of Zion establishing printing presses forming a company with a capitol of $150,000, dollars to build up Nauvoo I truly feel the saying a prophet is not without honor save his own country but it is of the Lord & not of man & to him be the glory. Regards with respect W. Woodruff 
 give my respects to Thompson if you see him. I hope  I may be permitted to again behold your faces again  in the flesh if the Lord will.

 Zion's Co-operative Mercantile Institution.  ORGANIZED 1868.  OFFICERS: WILFORD WOODRUFF, President, MOSES THATCHER, Vice-Prest., THOS. G. WEBBER, Secretary,  A. W. CARLSON, Treasurer.  DIRECTORS: Geo. Q. Cannon, Jos. F. Smith, H. J. Grant, John Sharp, W. H. Rowe, J. R. Winder, H. Dinwoodey, P. T. Farnsworth, J. R. Barnes, G. Romney, T. W. Jennings.  SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH, MARCH 16, 1891.  TO THE STOCKHOLDERS OF ZION'S CO-OPERATIVE MERCANTILE INSTITUTION:  The increase of trade and demand made upon the Institution by some of its best customers for accommodation, convinces us that our capital of $1,000,000 is inadequate to transact the large business of almost $4,000,000 per annum that the Institution is now doing; particularly when it is remembered that upon some lines of goods we have to give four months' time after the goods have  arrived here and been sold.  At a meeting of the Board of Directors held on the 15th of  February, the subject of increasing the Capital Stock was referred to a special committee who have reported, recommending that the Capital be increased 2,500 shares, and that $135 per share be charged for this increase, $100 of which will be credited to Cap- ital Stock account, and the remaining $35 to Reserve Fund, so as  to place the new stock exactly on a par with the old, so far as reserves are concerned.  In our showing just made of the assets and liabilities of the Institution, it will be seen that we have a Reserve Fund of  $350,000, to say nothing of the extremely low valuation placed upon real estate and buildings and on our stock of merchandise; so I have no hesitation in saying that at $135 per share, it is under rather than over the actual value of the Stock. Our showing for the past year is a good one, as good as any we have heretofore  made, and we have every reason to believe that we shall continue to do a large and prosperous business, and I see no cause why we should not be able to pay as good dividends as we have heretofore done, after this increase has been added to the Capital Stock. It is proposed to allot this Capital Stock pro rata to our present stockholders in the proportion of 25 per cent of their present holdings, but no subscription will be received for fractional parts of a share, excepting from such as now own a fraction and desire to make up a full share.  A circular has been prepared, which I have pleasure in enclosing with this, upon which stockholders will kindly notify the Secretary of the Institution whether they wish to subscribe and take ths additional stock or otherwise. It is important that the matter should be attended to by the stockholders as early as possible and the notification returned without delay. The new Stock must be paid for to the Treasurer of the Institution, one- half on or before May 1st, and the balance on or before Aug. 1st, 1891.  Respectfully,  Wilford Woodruff President.

You said you thought I had better not write affter I received your letter dated Jan. 5 for you would be on your way home but I hear that the mail goes through to Fillmore this time therefore will not write again. I enclose br Harts bill of books. We hear that all of the members of Congress are getting themselves new way wives if so I hope you will not be an odd one among them. It is funny that the would be no- bility have got into such a jangle.

 OFFICE OF The First Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  P.O. Box B.  Salt Lake City, Utah, August 23, 1895.  Prest. James E. Steele and Couselors, Presidency Bingham Stake. of Zion,  Dear Brethren:  Since the visit of Bro. Steele to this city we have  further considered the question of laocation of headquarters of your  stake, and have fully concluded, after conferring with Elder John Henry  Smith who figured prominently in its organization, that Iona is in  every way and the most proper as well as perhaps the most suitable place for  headquarters, it not only being the residence of the stake presidency,  but is also quite centrally located. We therefore recommend that the  people one and all regard Iona as headquarters of your stake.  As a stake organization you are starting out with the very  best of prospects. You have a remarkably good country, both healthful  and fruitful, with an abundant supply of water and singularly well  adapted to stockraising as well as agriculture. With industry, so char- acteristic of our people, coupled with intelligent management, and  accompanied by the blessing of God, prosperity must necessarily attend  your labors. We look for and expect prosperity to come to Zion in  fulfillment of the promises of the Lord; but we are not unmindful of the  fact that with prosperity come temptations, and too often evilas, which  render the latter state of a people worse than the first. As we have  learned to rejoice and acknowledge the hand of the Lord in the days of  our poverty we certaihnly should be able to acknowledge his hand in times  of prosperity; but this we can only do by being prepared to successfully  meet any new conditions which a favorable change in our temporal 
 with all Church business as far as they have the power  again I do not see how any Latter Day Saint can vote  or hold office under that Law it throws off our  property vote then lends to tax as High as they please  with no one to say why do you so however I hope  for the best & trust in God but it looks to me  as though it were going to work Great Hardships to  the Saints I was afraid that we were going to loose  Sister Cottam but I am thankful to say she  has revived & is getting Better but Brother Cottam  is getting worse He has 2 fits in 3 days, was overcome overcome in her sickness and it came near mak- ing letter Thompson sick as the Heft of the Brethren came upon her Brother Thompson sent his Horse  on a 4 days Journey to get another I expect to returne to  the templ tomorow or as soon as his horse comes  & stopt there untill the xxx is done then I shall  returne to my abode I was in Arizona a few  days since within 3 Miles of the spring. I expect to list  it soon after & return I rather think I shall  spend a Hermit Summer there as the water is  cold & plenty of shade I shall not be entirely done  but I shall have more of my own family one at least I would like to have to keep me company  awhile but I not do the best I can God Bless you Broth. & Sister A & all the family send love Br A. son  & wife are now playing on the organ & singing Hard times come again  No More But I dont think they have quite eroded My love  to all the family As ever yours L A

 circumstances may bring upon us. As leaders among the people, these  two thoughts should be uppermost in your minds: The salvation of souls,  and the building up of Zion. If you yourselves have these desires  burining within you, you will be able to imbue your bishops and ^[their]^ coun- selors with the same feelings; and if you as a body of presiding priest- hood are united in your labors to this end you will have the power to  draw the people to you and guide them in the paths of righteousness; and  the evil one, who is ever on the alert to make inroads among the saints,  will not have power to divide or make headway against you. Without  being rigid or arbitrary you should make it a point to maintain, through  the co-operation of the general priesthood, as well as that of your  presiding officers, the discipline of the church, as this is the means  by which the saints are preserved from the wiles of the adversary. YThe  morals of the people should be jealously guarded, and the name of God  should not be used in vain. These two things we would especially have  you impress upon your young men. And if, in the course of events, fdiffi- culties arise among brethren, we hope they will make it a point to  settle the same in an amicable way without resorting to tribunals either  of the Church or State; and if possible to not let the sun go down  upon their wrath.  Living, as many of the brethren do live, upon their farms  at long distances from each other and from houses of public worship, they  are necessarily deprived more or less of that education which is derived  from association afforded by settlement and town life. We trust that  the brethren so situated will, with their families, not fall into the  habit of working on Sundays; but that they will keep holy the Sabbath  day as we are commanded to do, and make it a point to attend meetings  and Sunday school.  It is very important that your ward records be well kept, and 
 PRESIDENT'S OFFICE, Salt Lake City, Utah, August 3, 1888.  Elder John Steele, Toquerville.  Dear Brother:  Your very interesting favor of the 30th. of July has been received and read with great pleasure.  Yours has been indeed a pioneer and a busy life, and you are in a position now to give much valuable counsel to the rising generation, and to describe to them the hardships and privations and the shifts which the settlers of this country had to contend with and to resort to in the beginning. A new generation is now upon the scene, and though they hear occasionally con- cerning the work of the pioneers and the difficulties they had to contend with, still, in this city particularly, their ideas are exceedingly vague respecting these matters, and the men and women who can give them information from their personal experiences are fast passing away. There are really but few left.  I am glad that you have mentioned the birth of your  daughter; for there is another claimant for the honor of being the first white child born in the Valley after the arrival of the Pioneers. As I now remember 
 nan 
 the date of his birth as it was announced, your daughter was born before he was. I think I shall have your letter published in the Deseret News, as it contains a number of interesting items that are worthy of preservation.  I am glad to hear from you that you are enjoying your- self so well, and that your heart still beats with the love of Zion and the desire to see the Kingdom of God more widely spread and established. That you may live very many years yet to see the fruits of your labors and the increase of righteousness in the earth, is my earnest desire.  With kind regards, I am, Your Brother,  Wilford Woodruff 
 that proper care be taken of them as they become filled up, for future  generations will highly prize and make good use of them.  In the erection of public buildings the greatest wisdom should  be exercised. They are public property and should, therefore, reflect  the general intelligence and tatste of the people, and we hope that due  regard will be shown in the beauty of their design, ventilation, &c., by  obtaining the best available architectural ability in the preparation  of the plans. And we may add in this connection, that whatever you may  undertake in the way of erecting public buildings, invlolving a consider- able expenditure of means, should be done as much as possible within  your own resources, and not with the expectation that the Church may be  relied upon to make up deficiencies. Some of our stake and ward  officers have of late found themselves in the exceedingly unpleasant  position of being totally unable to meet public obligations contracted  by them without our knowledge or consent, ^and for the payment of which they themselves were held individually ^responsible;^^ and they have appealed to us  to help them to preserve their credit and maintain their financial honor,  while at the same time we were over-burdened ourselves. We have felt  that if brethren look to us for help for such purposes, they should  consult us before they involve themselves, and thus afford us an oppor- tunity of conferring with them as to the advisbability of such undertak- ings; otherwise they should depend wholly on their own resources. In  most of the stakes there is what is called a stake meeting house, a  building erected by the stake as a whole, which answers a good and  worthy purpose in the rich and populous stakes; but in newly organized  and sparsely settled stakes such a large central building it would not  be advisable to undertake to erect. We advise rather the erection of  commodious ward meeting houses and good boweries, so that stake con- ferences acan be taken to the people, so to speak; that is, they can be  held in the wards with bowery accommodations in the summer season, and 
 PRESIDENT'S OFFICE  CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST.  OF  LATTER-DAY SAINTS,  P. O. BOX B.  Salt Lake City, U. T. May 9th, 1889.  Elder John Steele,  Toquerville.  Dear Brother: Your letter of May 5th has been received, in which you  set forth the expressed wishes of your sister, made before her death and after your  explaining to her the true order of marriage and of adoption of her children, to be  sealed to you for eternity, instead of to her husband; and if that was not ad- missible, that she be sealed to your son, M. M. Steele. You also rsay "I told her I  did not know how that would be; such things had been done, but I did not know how  it would be again."  Of course, I am not econversant with what information you may have on  this subject; but I am not aware of any such sealings or adoptions in this Church.  I do not consider it proper for any such sealings or adoptions to be administered in  the Temples of the Lord. It is not any more proper for your sister to be sealed to  you as her husband, now that she is dead, than it would be if she were alive;  neither should she be sealed to your son, because such a marriage is too near of 
 nan 
 kin.  If your sister, while alive, did not feel that she wished to be sealed  to her living husband for eternity, and if she did not express any preference on  that matter other than the ones you mention, you should then make a choice in her  behalf, and have her sealed to some faithful man in the Church, either living or  dead, and have her children adopted into his family.  Trusting this will be satisfactory to you,  I remain your brother,  W Woodruff 
 the ward meeting houses in the cold weather. We believe, too, the  results will be altogether better by distributing the conferences in  this way than by holding them all the time at one place; and, besides,  the investment involved in one large central building would be spared to  you.  Before closing our communication we feel to add a few words  in regard to politics. You are doubtless already aware of the counsel  given to the presiding priesthood at the meeting held in October 1893  on this subject, and therefore all that we now need to say is that the  time which has expired since then has only gone to prove the wisdom of  the policy adopted by us on that occasion. It is true that some of our  brethren from a restless desire to do something for their party have  failed to strictly carry out the counsel given at the meeting referred  to; but it is a noteworthy fact that wherever this has been the case  the results have been anything but satisfactory. We mention this for  the purpose of reminding you that as a stake presidency or as individuals  you have no place whatever in the field of active politics unless there  be good and sufficient reasons to the contrary. In starting out in the  labors of your official career it is of the utmost importance that you  maintain the dignity of your high calling, and that your minds be free  from bias of every description; and this we are sure will be the case inasmuch as you seek earnestly to the Lord to know and carry out his  will. In this connection it may be interesting to quote to you one of  the significant sayings of the Prophet Joseph. There are three agents,  he taught us, at work on the earth the Spirit of God, the spirit of  man, and the spirit of the Evil One. Brethren in the days of the  Prophet were deceived, and brethren all along the line since his day  have been deceived, and doubtless brethren will yet be deceived as  between the Spirit of God and the spirit of man, simply because they  have sought to carry out their own will and way, and to minister to 
 nan 
 their o[w]n personal ambitions and selfish desires rather than to be  servants of God and shpepherds of his sheep. As long as you labor  unselfishly for Zion, for the blessing and uplifting of the people whom  God has called you to preside over, you will be entitled to His Spirit  to inspire and guide you in all your labors, and you will never be  found at a loss to distinguish between that Spirit which emanates from  God, and that spirit whixch has its source in man. We feel to say this to  you for the reason that whatever influence and power you may possess as  a presidency or as individuals are given to you of the Lord; and as God  our Father is a jealous God, so it becomes us his servants, in whiom he ha^s^  reposed a great and important trust, to be jealous also, that is, jealous  that all the power which comes from him to us, and through us to our  fellow servants, is used to his honor and to his glory, for the  building up of Zion, and the slalvation of our brethren and sisters.  Whenever you or either of you, come to the city we shall  be pleased to see you, and shall be glad to hear from you at any time on  any and all important mantters pertaining to the government of your stake.   Praying the Lord to give you every needed blessing, we are, with kind  regards,  Your Brethren,  Wilford Woodruff Geo. Q. Cannon

 City of Nauvoo January 27th 1845  Bro, W. Woodruff  We take the Earliest opportunity to  address a few lines to you, to make you acquainted with  the proceedings of the Legislators of the State of Illinois. Since they assembled in council in the City of  Springfield, there has been no business of any  importance transacted for the benefit and welfare  of the citizens of said State, but on the other hand  they have been continually debating and discussing  upon the Charter of the City of Nauvoo, and  the latest intelligence which we have received from  Springfield is that they have repealed the City Charter  also, the Legion Charter, but you know, we care  nothing about it for them that would kill the  prophets, would also take away our charter, but  they are only filling the cup of their damnation the more  which will send them to Hell, and that seems to be  the place for them any how, for their works do prove it to a demonstration, they have passed judgment  upon an innocent people as a community, but glory to  God the day is not far distant when they shall be  caught in a straight, & the measure which they meted  to us shall be meted to them two fold and running over.

You sold those grocries remarkably well  they paid a large profit. As to Books and  stationary I do not now who to send to  or who would take charge of them across the  plains, they might go & then again they might  not.

Mrs. Carters health is not very good, about the same as usual. Father continues smart.  No news of much interest, aside from strange political and theological proceedings these days things are in strange confusion in this country, what  the result may be remains to be determined.  I think it would be prudent for all to be watching, that they may be found with those "blessed servants." The $100 sent by brother Milo Andrews was promptly rec.d. Dr Bernhisel has not yet paid that debt. I have written to him to day on the subject. I do not hear one word from Hunor & Johnson in any way and hope you will be able to pin them when they arrive at the valley, if they could not pay the money due, the least they could do would be to write and answer my letters and make some explanations why they dont pay they must certainly receive my letters for they were directed to the care of Middletin & Rily St. Jus. where Mrs. Huner lives.

She has been very low and suf- fered a great deal. Luther has been much  afflicted with a fellin on one of his fingers, has had his finger taken off twice, or a part  of it at a time, it is now getting better. Rhoda has been ill so long that the old  Lady Ms. Scammons became quite exhausted, and has died. We hope that Ms. S. from  present appearances will recover.  No news of interest, with us. We have a  report this morning that France and England  have made a final declaration of war  against Russia, and the prospect is that there  will be much blood shed, "the end is not  yet", what the result will be remains to be  determined.

I do not hear a word from Huner or any of his friends, not one cent of the money you sent last year by him has been forwarded I think that under the circumstance you was very successful indeed in securing that and in my opinion it was the best and only course to take with him to save it, to drive him right into it, after the principle is paid should he not pay the interest? I had no confidence in his former statements to you and I suppose he would liked to have put you off until he could have got away. I really desire to feel thankful that it is in so good  a shape.

 I hope Reese & Co. will pay the balance due on those bonds at once (an account of which I gave you after my return) so that you will be able to forward it when you next remit.  Should something favorable occur so that you could remit a considerable portion of that amount in the Spring it would be most acceptible to me and would perhaps enable me to get relieved of this most uncomfortable and oppressive burden under which I have been toiling and labouring for a long time.  We have nothing new of interest to communicate. Do please write often for we feel anxious to hear from you by every mail. Anna Carter recd a letter from Sarah E. Foss but by some of your friends to St. Louis "I did not receive mine" I have no doubt you wrote me.  Please remember me very kindly to Ms Foss and family (us, Ms. C, and myself I should have said), to our mutual friend Sister Whitaker in whom we feel much interest and to all our friends generally.  Hoping that God will guide and direct you and yours in all things and that we may so live that we may obtain that [course] of life hereafter is the prayer of  Very truly Your Brother Ilus.

Now if I can  engage in that thing with good prospect of a  profitable opperation I should like to do so  and unless it looked very favorable indeed,  it would not answer for me to take the risk in my present dilapidated situation.  I will ask the favour of you to investigate  the matter and write me by the first mail.  We have nothing new of interest, matters  move in much the same as usual, business  is rather dull, generally. We are all about  as well as usual. Mother has been poorly for  the past two or three months but we think she  is a little better now. Father is smart, he  goes to Concord this week to visit his friends he recd a letter and paper a few days since  from Salt Lake but, across by one of the mission- aries. E. and family are well. Mr. and Mrs. W. Woodruff were announced in one of the  Boston papers amoung the arrivals from Utah,  (as a part of the companies of missionaries) I have  not yet seen them here and think of course it  was a mistake. If I can attend to anything for you  here please inform me and I will be most  happy to do it for you. Please remember me  very kindly to Mrs. W. and family and all our friends, that heavens choicist and finest blessings may be on you and your dear family is the prayer of, yours truly Ilus.

 Washington March 16, 1854 Dear Brother,  I have just received your  favor of the 24th of December, and I hasten to drop you a line, hoping that it may  reach Independence in season for the  April Mail.  I sincerely regret to inform you that it will not be in my power to meet the draft in favor of Sanborn and  Carter at present, but I hope to be able  to do so in the course of three or four  months.  The saddle, bridle, and martingale  cost either sixteen or seventeen dollars  in Saint Louis, I am not quite sure which. Therefore we cannot sell the saddle for  $15 dollors, but you may sell them  for what may be considered a fair price.  Please sell the arsenic if it can be  found, and I suppose it can.  Please to  let me hear from you as often as you  can make it convenient.  In haste Your friend John M. Bernhisel  Mr Woodruff.

 Washington December 25, 1854  Elder Wilford Woodruff,  Dear Brother,  Your communication  of the 30th of October was received on the  night of the 21st instant. I regret to hear that a part of my goods are missing. There  were two bales of blankets, one of blue,  and the other of white, and eleven bales  of other goods. I desired brother Eldredge,  if the load should be too heavy to leave  the box or chest you received, at Saint  Louis, but it seems he brought this and  left another which I regret. In the  box he brought there are three or four  reams of writing and letter paper of  a superior quality, envelopes large  and small, pencils and quills, if you  think you can dispose of these articles you may get them and do so.  I approve you plan of taking  the good into the country to dispose of.  The missing bale is probably a bale  of blankets, there was no bale of blankes 
 Washington City February 28, 1854  Mr Wilford Woodruff,  Dear Sir,  I addressed a few  lines to you by the last mail.  Will you have  the kindness to inform me at your earliest  convenience whether you have disposed of  the saddle and bridle, the nails, hardware, penknives, and broad cloth.  Please to furnish  me with a list of a few of the principal articles you have yet on hand.  Tell me too what  articles of merchandize find the best sale  in your market.  Would good heavy three  print blankets meet with ready sale in  your Utah, and if so, what colors, and  what number could be sold in the course  of an autumn and winter?

I hope never to see the young men drawing off from their Fathers, and sit up an independant position. I expect better things of them. I trust they will not disappoint the Prophet and their Fathers bilut will carry on this work. The judgement of God await the wicked, and also this nation if they repent not. Joseph Smith holds the keys of the Priesthood in this generation, and will hold the same through eternity.

 but we have lost but little stock in comparison with last year. The snow in the vallies has gone off so gradually, the ground is thoroughly soaked 3 feet deep. I do not know how much deeper. Spring has broke upon us mild and warm, the top of the ground is beginning to be dry but the wells are raising.  Every kind of fruit trees from the apples to the currant, are  loaded with fruit buds and some of the Peaches and apricots are  ready to blossom. I think it will be a fruitful year for all kinds of fruit; grain and vegetables. The cottonwood canal is nearly finished it has been a great job. I expect the stone will come floating to the Temple, they are now hauling with cattle: the temple foundation is  surrounded with stone cutters who make rich sweet music. I expect  after conference there will be several hundreds cutting stone, and the tem- ple will be pushed.  We have had a great Reformation this winter, one of the fruits are all have confessed their sins either great or small, restored their stollen property, all have been baptized from the Presidency down: all isare trying to pay their Tithing and nearly all are trying to get wives until there is hardly a girl 14 years old in Utah but what is married or just going to be. President Young has hardly time to eat, drink, or sleep in consequence of marrying the people and attending to the endowments.  I never have had so much to do in my life. I would think it would wear him out. There has hardly been a ball or party for recreation [th]rough this Territory for the last 6 months. I have attended a meeting of some kind about every evening through the past winter and have not visited your family much, nor any body else; not among my own but little for 5 months and generally get to bed about 11 or 12 oclock. I have

 seen this people feel the importance of living their religion as much as they have done, the past winter. I hope it will continue. the power of God has been with in preaching and teaching in all the Quorum and Ward meetings. I commenced with J. M. Grant before he died, and after his death the burthen [burden] of the care of the Missionaries rested upon me and bro. F. D. Richards; who was unwell consid- erable but attended most of the time. L. Snow and O. Hyde have been with me a part of the time. The Presidency and Twelv (except myself) and about 100 others are expecting to go on a summer Trip North to Salmon river.  This Spring A. Lyman & C. C. Rich will be with us about the first of May. I expect they will take a European mission, some missionaries will be called to Europe and to the islands. President  Young would like to send a mission to Siberia and the Japan- ese islands. The Lamanites are doing well, Arrowpeene and Kanosh with other chiefs, are making great improvement. Arrow- peene preached a short discourse in the Tabernacle lately, it was good.  We have given up the Lead mines after making about 10 or 12.00 lbs.; it is quite expensive and does not work as well as expected. a cotton company are called to go to the Rio Virgin. We are going to try the chinese Sugar cane this summer as far as we can get seed.  All is peace and prosperity with us throughout this Territory some are going to California this Spring, several in the Southern settlements have started on the short road, or cut off to go there, and no doubt some others will follow them soon.

 1878-11-09 Apostles C C Rich and W Woodruff addressed the meeting spoke upon the rise and progress of the great Latter day Work and the opposition contending against it. God chooses the weak things of the world to confound the mighty as instances in Moses in the deciples of Jesus and in the  Prophet Joseph Smith & others. [##1 Corinthians 1:27##] Was pleased to see the great facilities we have in these mountains for building Temples. If we could see behind the veil we should have no trouble to get Temples built. The work for the redemption of the dead is great. 
 1883-08-18 Apostle Wilford Woodruff said he would report the ward he come from. The 1st Presidency are trying to do their best to build up Gods Kingdom The Apostles and Seventies and High Priests are doing the same the societies organized to assist the Bp are doing the best they can. We have also about 40 grog shops but the saints of God do not patronize them. Spoke on the work of the redemption of the dead 
 Pres W Woodruff said it gave him great pleasure and Satisfaction to meet in the beautiful building with the Saints of Bear Lake. This is one of hte most beautiful houses ever built by the Saints in this generation and it is a credit to the Pres of this Stake of Zion and the Elders and Saints who have assisted  We have no reason to be discouraged concerning the great work. Joseph Smith lived 14 years to lay the foundation of this work. The Lord has as far fulfilled his promises to us. He has never forsaken His people in the midst of all their trials and persecution nor will He in time to come. There is no people on the earth that has been called to so great a work as the L. D. S. many of the revelations and prophicies would have failed had not the Saints been gathered inst. One of the greatest testimonies is in the fact of all the Sects of the world being united in the persecution of this people. This work is not dead, and it is not going to die. We are here upon a mission to help build up this Kingdom and if  faithful we shall, continue our labors behind the veil. Read the Book of Mormon. Doc and Cov, the Bible and all  good books. We have built three Temples in these Vallies where we can officiate for our dead and where that work is being performed day by day. When we go behind the veil we will find our history recorded in the Courts above 
 1889-08-11Pres W. Woodruff fell thankful for the opportunity of again partaking of the Sacrament. Made remarks thereon. Gave an outline of the organization of the Church through the Prophet Joseph Smith. Also on the Priesthood as being the only power by which man can administer in the ordinances of life and salvation. No matter what position a man holds if he honors his Priesthood that man has power with the Heavens. Such a man cannot be led astray. This people will  never be led astray, they will never be without a  law given until Christ comes to reign. The second coming of the Son of man is near at hand, the prophicies will all be fulfilled. Let us do our duty and leave our enemies in the hands of God. The Lord will not require the L. D. S. to go to war or stain their hands with blood nor will he permit our blood to be shed only perhaps in individual cases, but not as a general thing. Honor God and keep His commandments. To the young people he would say learn to pray, they will have to bear off the Kingdom 
 1889-08-12Pres W. Woodruff. A man has a right to preach what he practices. The word of Wisdom has been and is practiced by myself and Council. Don't go into debt. Don't buing machinery which you can do without. Pay your debts. There are men who have withdrawn from the Church in order to accomplish their political rights. I wish to say to them that they are justified before the Lord.  [left side of page] Pres Woodruff justifies the Mormons with- drawing from the Church to vote. [end of text]  The congregation voted in unison.  Wherever there is a Church established that has not Apostles, Prophets and other officers of the Church it is not the Church of God. Where they have not the Authority of the Eternal Priesthood there is no Church of Christ. Abraham Isaac and Jacob were Patriarchs they held the Holy Priesthood. Joseph Smith organized this Church by the power of the Priesthood. How greatly the children of the L. D. S are blessed to live in the midst of Prophets, Apostles, Elders &c who have the word of God. Their fathers hold the Priesthood They should obey them and honor them. No man can comprihend the torments and sufferings of those who have tasted of the blessings of Eternal life and turn there from. Spoke of the mission of Bro Cannon to the Sandwich Islands and the introduction of the Gospel to that people. The speaker said his life had been preserved many times through listening to the voice of the Spirit. Related many incidents in support of the above. 
 1889-08-12 Pres Woodruff said his feeling were that many of the rising generation before him will live until Christ comes in the clouds of Heaven. He wanted to see the young people stop doing that which is wrong and cultivate the Spirit of Prayer and fel and qualify themselves for active service in the Kingdom. The judgements of God are at our doors. 
 1889-09-15 Pres W. Woodruff, said whenever a watchman is set upon the tower of Zion and he does not give warning when the enemy approaches he will be held to account. Joseph asked the Lord for wisdom and the Lord appeared to him, also His Son Jesus Christ. Joseph Smith was ordained to introduce and lay the foundation of this great and mighty work. After he received the manifestations which he had he would have been damned if he had not obeyed the voice of God. He had traveled hundreds of miles with and was well acquainted with the  Prophet. This generation has a great debt to pay in shedding the blood of the Prophets. The Jews have had to pay for shedding the blood of the Savior, they have been in bondage in consequence for hundreds of years. Crime is largely on the increase. There is a thousand murders today where there was one when the Book of  Mormon was translated and other crimes have increased in like proportion. Testified that God moved upon Columbus to search out and open up the way to this land. Washington was inspired to do his work and the Declaration of Independence is an inspired document. He was sorry for this great Nation because it will cost them just as much as any other nation who sheds the blood of the Prophets. What will be the result of these persecutions? The judgements of God are ^and well be^ poured out upon the Nations. He heard Joseph Smiths last speech before his martyrdom who sealed upon the Twelve all the Keys and powers which he then held. Exhorted the Saints to be true and faithful to their covenants.
