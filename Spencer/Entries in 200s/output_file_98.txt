August 10, 1842 ~ Wednesday   10th As soon as the boat  arived at Nauvoo and landed our freight and I saw it distributed to its several places  whare it belonged I went home and retired to  my bed and passed through the severest  fit of sickness I ever experience in life I had a  thorough course of the Billious fever I was  brought exceding low and for several days I strugled  between life and death I felt some of the time  like gathering up my feet and sleeping with my fathers ENDENTRY August 10, 1842 ~ Wednesday to  ENDENTRY September 19, 1842 ~ Monday   I was confined to my Bed or house from the  10th of Aug to the 19th of Sept making 40 days  during my sickness the Twelve came and anointed  me and lade hands upon me and rebuke my  fever and I felt a testimony that I should recover  after I began to recover I had a relaps twice which  put me back much. In one instance I was  requested to attend a Conference or Council of the  quorum of the Twelve in the case of Orson Pratt  I was weak and feeble yet I thought I would try to  meet with them with the expectation that they  would meet at Elder John Taylors who was  also vary low with the Billious fever but on our  arival at his house he was so vary feeble he was  not able to have it there so it was remove to  President B. Young  conveyed me in his carriag to the place of  meeting but I had not been in the house more  than 10 minutes before my strength began to  fail me I lay down upon a bench but had no  sooner lain down than I was gone my breath  stoped, my Brethren raised me up took me to the  door into the air and with the assistance of water  air andc I was brought to breath again but not without  a hard struggle between life and death the Breth- ering lade hands upon me and Br Hyram Smith  prayed for my recovery I soon began to breathe  free but I was deprived of all my strength  they convey me home, it being a warm time  I was much troubled for breathing through most  of the night and it took me several days to recover  my former strength.  During my sickness there was some important  things transpired in the Church we received  the word of the Lord concerning the  Elders of the Church (through Joseph the  Seer) The Lord manifested that it was  his will that the first presidency, the  Twelve, The High Council The quorum  of High Priest, and the Elders quorum  as a general thing should go into  the vineyard. The instructions were  for the Elders to confine themselves to the  ENDENTRY to the free States and mostly to New England  and the Canidas not to go to any of the indians  or Slave States. The result was that a  special conference was called and three or  four hundred Elders were called upon to  go into the vineyard and about 400 Elders have  since gone and many others are going their  has never at any time been as great a  turn out into the vineyard since the  foundation of the Church, Br J. Taylor and my- self are the ownly ones of the Twelve that  have not gone out into the vineyard we being  sick could not go besides it was thought  wisdom for us to continue in the printing  Business. There was a Counsel of the  Twelve held for four days with Elder  Orson Pratt to labour with him to  get him to recall his sayings against Joseph  and the The Twelve but he persisted in his  wicked course and would not recall any of his  sayings which were made in public against  Joseph and others sayings which were unjust  and untrue. The Twelve then rejected  him as a member of their quorum and he  was cut off ^from the Church^ Dr John Cook Bennet was  the ruin of Orson Pratt, ^He was Cut off from  the Church Aug 20, 1842^ President Joseph  Smith has been much persecuted of late  by being hunted and sought for by sheriffs  and officers from Illinoise  by the orders of Governors Reynolds and  Carlin under pretence of taking him to Missouri  to try him for being accessary to the shoot in  of ex Gov Bogg but it is no more or less than  the spirit of persecution but though Joseph  has been deprived of the privilege of appearing  openly and deprived of the society of his own  family Because sheriffs are hunting him to  destroy him without cause. Yet the LORD is  with ^him^ as he was upon the Isle of Patmos  with John.

The Lord hath opened  a door within a few days for puting the  town of Keokirk into the hands of the Saints  and Joseph's council was for me to go to keokirk  and publish a political paper and Elder Taylor  publish the Times and Seasons in Nauvoo so I  am aranging the affairs of my family to  do as the Lord may direct.

Joseph Smith  before the Female Relief Society of Nauvoo.  ENDENTRY Ap 28, 1842  Prest. J. Smith arose and called the attention of the meeting  to the 12th Chap. 1st ##1 Corinthians 12|Corin##th "Now concerning spiritual gifts" andc,  said that the passage which reads "no man can say Jesus is  the christ but by the Holy Ghost", should be translated, no  man can Know. andc, ##1 Corinthians 12:3##  He contind. to read the chapter and give instructions re- specting the different offices, and the necessity of every individu- al acting in the sphere allotted him or her, and filling the several  offices to which they were appointed - spoke of the disposition  of men, to consider the lower offices in the church dishonorable  and to look with jealous eyes upon the standing of others, that  it was the nonsense of the human heart, for a person to be aspiring  to other stations than appointed of God - that it was better  for individuals to magnify their respective callings, and wait  patiently till God shall say to them to come up higher.  He said the reason of these remarks being made, was, that  some little thing was circulating in the Society, that some  persons were not going right in laying hands on the sick andc,  said if he had common sympathies, would rejoice that the  sick could be healed, that the time had not been before that  these things could be in their proper order that the church  is not now organized into its proper order, and cannot be until  the temple is completed - - - Pres Smith continued the  subject by adverting to the commision given to the ancient apos- tles "Go ye into all the world andc" ##Mark 16:15##- no matter who beleiveth;  these signs, such as healing the sick, casting out devils andc,  should follow all that beleive wether male or female.  He asked the society if they could not see by this Sweeping  stroke that wherein they are ordained it is the privilege  of those set apart to administer in that authority which is  conferred on them and if the sisters should have faith to  heal the sick, let all hold their tongues, and let every thing  roll on.  He said if God has appointed him, and chosen him as  an instrument to lead the church, why not let him lead  it through? Why stand in the way, when he is appointed to  do a thing? Who knows the mind of God? Does he not  ENDENTRY reveal things differently from what we expect? He remarked  that he was continually rising - altho' he had every thing  bearing him down, standing in his way and opposing - after all  he always comes out right at the end.  Respecting females laying on hands, he further remarkd  there could be no devil in it if God gave his sanction by healing  that there could be no more sin in any female laying hands  on the sick than in wetting the face with water that it  is no sin for any body to do it that has faith, or if the sick  has faith to be healed by the administration.  He reproved those that were disposed to find fault  with the management of concerns - saying if he undertook to  lead the church he would lead it right - that he calculates  to organize the church in proper order andc.  Pres Smith continued by speaking of the difficulties  he had to surmount ever since the commencement of the  work in consequence of aspiring men, "great big Elders" as he  called them, who had caused him much trouble, whom he  had taught in the private council: and they would go forth into  the world and proclaim the things he had taught them; as  there own revelations - said the same aspiring disposition will  be in this Society - and must be guarded against - that every  person should stand and act in the place appointed, and thus  sanctify the society and get it pure.  He said he had been trampled under foot by as- piring Elders, for all were infected with that spirit, for  instance J. Page had been aspiring  they could not be exalted but run away as tho' the care and  authority of the church were vested with them - he said he  had a subtile devil to deal with and could only curb him  by being humble.  He said as he had this opportunity he was  going to instruct the Society and point out the way for them  to conduct, that they might act according to the will  of God - that he did not know as he should have many  opportunities of teaching them as they were going to be  left to themselves, they would not long have him to  instruct them, that the church would not have  his instruction long, and the world would not be troubled  with him a great while, and would not have his teaching.  He spoke of delivering the Keys to this Society and the church  that according to his prayers God had appointed him  ENDENTRY elsewhere.  He exhorted the Sisters always to concentrate  their faith and prayers for, and place confidence in those  whom God has appointed to honor, whom God has  placed at the head to lead that we should arm them  with our prayers, that the keys of the Kingdom are  about to be given to them that they may be able to de- tect every thing false, as well as to the Elders.  He said if one member becomes corrupt and you  know it; you must immediately put it away. The  Sympathies of the heads of the church have induced them  to bear with those that were corrupt; in consequence  of which all become contaminated, you must put down  iniquity and by your good example provoke the Elders  to good works, if you do right no danger of going too fast:  he said he did not care how fast we run in the path  of virtue, resist evil and there is no danger, God, men, angels,  and devils, cant condemn those that resist every thing  that is evil - as well might the devil seek to disthrone  Jehovah as that soul that resists every thing that  is evil.  The charitable Society, this is according to your  natures, it is natural for females to have feelings of charity  you are now placed in a situation where you can act  according to those sympathies which God has planted  in your bosoms.  If you live up to these principles how great and glorious! if you live up to your privilege, the angels  cannot be restrained from being your associates - -  females if they are pure and innocent can come into  the presence of God, for what is more pleasing to God  than innocence, you must be innocent or you can  not come up before God, if we would come before  God let us be pure ourselves. The devil has great  power, he will so transform things as to make one  gape at those who are doing the will of God.  you need not be teasing men for their deeds, but  let the weight of innocence be felt, which is more  mighty than a mill stone hung about the neck.  Not war, not jangle, not contradiction, but meek- ness, love, purity, these are the things that should  magnify us. - Achan must be brought ##Joshua 7:19-26## ENDENTRY for it is a decree of the Lord that evry tree fruit  or herb bearing seed, should bring forth after its kind  and cannot come forth after any other law or princi- ple. Upon the same principle do I contend that  Baptism is a sign, ordained of God for the  believer in Christ to take upon himself in order to  enter into the kingdom of God, "for except  you are born of the water and the spirit you cannot  enter into the kingdom of God, saith the Savior, as  It is a sign of command which God hath set for  man to enter into this kingdom of God those who  seek to enter in any other way will seek in vain, for  God will not receive them neither will the angels  acknowledge their works as accepted, for they have  not taken upon themselves those ordinances and signs  which God ordained for man to receive in order to  receive a celestial glory, and God has decreed that all  that ^who^ will not obey his voice shall not escape the  damnation of hell. What is the damnation of  hell, to go with that society who have not obeyed  his commands. Baptism is a sign to God, to Angels to heaven that we do the will of God and their is  no other way beneath the heavens whareby  God hath ordained for man to come to God and any  other cource is in vain. God hath decreed and ordained that man should repent of all his sins and  Be Baptized for the remission of his sins then he  can come to God in the name of Jesus Christ in  faith, then we have the promise of the Holy Ghost  What is the sign of the healing of the sick?  the laying on of hands, is the sign or way  marked out by James and the custom of the  ancient saints as ordered by the Lord and we  should not obtain the blessing by persuing any  other course except the way which God has marked out.  What if we should attempt to get  the Holy Ghost through any other means except  the sign or way which God hath appointed, should  we obtain it certainly not all other means would  fail. The Lord says do so and so and I will bless so and so  their is certain key words and signs belonging to  the priesthood which must be observed in  order to obtaine the blessings ENDENTRY The sign of Peter was, to repent and be baptized  for the remission of sins, with the promise of the  gift of the Holy Ghost and in no other way is  the gift of the Holy Ghost obtained. Their is a  difference between the Holy Ghost and the gift of the  Holy Ghost. Cornelius received the Holy Ghost before  he was baptized which was the convincing power  of God unto him of the truth of the gospel, but  he could not receive the gift of the Holy Ghost  untill after he was baptized, and had he not taken  this sign or ordinances upon him the Holy Ghost which convinced him of the truth of God would  have left him, untill he obeyed these ordin- ances and received the gift of the Holy Ghost by the  laying on of hands according to the order  of God he could not have healed the sick or  command an evil spirit to come out of a  man and it obey him for the spirit might  say to him as he did to the sons of Seava and  Peter I know and Christ I know but who  are ye  It matereth not whether we live long  or short after we come to a knowlede of these princi- ples and obey them. I know that all men will be  damned if they do not come in the way which God  has appointed  As concerning the resurrection I will  merly say that all men will come from the grave  as they lie down, whether old or young their  will not be added unto ther stature one cubit neither  taken from it. All being raised by the power of God  having the Spirit of God in their bodies and not blood Children will be enthroned in the presence of God  and the Lamb with bodies of the same stature that  were on earth. Having been redeemed by the  Blood of the Lamb they will there enjoy a fulness  of that light Glory and intelligence which is receiv- ed in the Celestial kingdom of God. "Blessed are the  dead who die in the Lord, for they rest from their ENDENTRY labours and their works do follow them  The speaker before closing called upon the vast  assembly before him to humble themselves in faith  before God, and in mighty Prayer and fasting to call  upon his Holy name, untill the elements were  purified over our heads and the earth sanctified under  our feet that the inhabitants of this city may  escape the power of the disease, pestilence and destroyer  that rideth upon the face of the earth and that the  holy spirit of God may rest upon this vast multitude  At the close of the meeting President Smith informed  the congregation that he should attend to the  ordinance of Baptism in the his ho river near his  house at 2 oclock. And at the appointed hour  the bank of the missisippi was lined with a multitude  of people and President Joseph Smith went  forth into the river and Baptized with his own  hands about 80 persons for the remission of  their sins and what added Joy to the scene the  first person Baptized was Mr L.D. Wason a  nephew of Sister Emma Smith the first of  her kindred that have embraced the fulness of  the gospel. At the close of this interesting scene  the Administrator lifted up his hands towards  heaven and implored the blessing of heaven ^God^ to  rest upon the People, and truly the spirit of  God did rest upon the multitude to the Joy and consolation of our harts. After Baptism  the congregation again repaired to the grove  near the Temple to attend to the ordinance of  Confirmation and notwithstanding president Smith  had spoken in the open air to the people and stood  in the water and baptized about 80 person about 50  of those baptized received their confirmation  under his hands in the after part of the day, and during the intermission of these meetings their  was probably as many more Baptized and confirmed  for their Dead relatives at the Font By the Twelve And those who wish for further information  concerning the scenes of the Sabbath in Nauvoo or any other day in the week I would say to all  such come and see. W. Woodruff. ENDENTRY March 21, 1842 ~ Monday to  ENDENTRY March 27, 1842 ~ Sunday   27 ^Sunday^ FIGURE This was an interesting day. A  large assembly met in the grove near the Temple  Br Amisa Lyman addressed the assembly and made  many interesting remarks. He was followed by  Joseph the Seer who made some edifying remarks  concerning baptism for the dead. He said the Bible  supported the doctrin, "why are ye baptized for  the dead if the dead rise not andc" if their is one word  of the Lord that supports the doctrin it is enough to make  it a true doctrin. Again if we can baptize a man in the Name of the Father of the Son and of the Holy Ghost  for the remission of sins it is just as much our privilege  to act as an agent and be baptized for the remission  of sins for and in behalf of our dead kindred who have not  herd the gospel or fulness of it.

It has been hard for me to live on earth and see those young men upon whome we have lean- ed upon as a support and comfort taken from us in  the midst of their youth, yes it has been hard to  be reconciled to these things I have sometimes felt  that I should have felt more reconciled to have been  called myself if it could have been the will  of God, yet I know we ought to be still and know  it is of God and be reconciled all is right it  will be but a short time before we shall all in  like manner be called. It may be the case  with me as well as you. Some has supposed  that Br Joseph could not die but this is a  mistake it is true their has been times when  I have had the promise of my life to accomplish  such and such things, but having accomplish those  things I have not at present any lease of my  life and am as liable to die as other men ENDENTRY I can say in my heart that I have not done any  thing against Ephraim Marks that I am sorry for  and I would ask any of his companions if they  have done any thing against him that they are  sorry for or that they would not like to meet at  the bar of God if so let it prove as a warning to  all men to deal justly before God and with all men then we shall be clear in the day of judgment When we loose a near and dear friend upon whom  we have set our hearts we can never feel the same  afterwards knowing that if we set our hearts upon  others they may in like manner be taken from us President Smith made many other interesting  remarks and left it for President Rigdon to close  President Rigdon arose and also said many interes- ting things and among other said that when we see a princi- ple that makes us the most Happy if we will cultivate  that principle and practice it ourselves it will render others  Happy for that course of conduct that pleases you will  please others. I would say to the mourners that  death has made his heaviest stroke at you for should  he take either of the parents away from the rest  of the family it would set them down in the king- dom of God with their son Ephraim, the speaker  remarked that the death of this young man had made  a vacancy in his heart that nothing could fill untill  it was filled by restoring the society of the same  person in eternity which is the case in loosing any  friend. All the remarks were vary appropriate that were  made on the occasion. The Body was then conveyd  to the grave in solemn silence and each as they pass- ed by droped in a branch of evergreen into the grave  the body was then coverd with earth which closed  the scenery.  The City Council met at 2 oclock I stayed a litt le season and came home with a hard head ake but  not withstanding this illness I set out a bed of english  strawburies and 150 stocks of english red raapberrys in  my garden which closed the business of the {day}  {We set} (3) {ponies loose} ENDENTRY April 10, 1842 ~ Sunday   April 10th Sunday  FIGURE A plesant morning A large congregation  of Saints met at the grove President William Law  addressed the assembly for about 1 hour  Then Joseph the Seer arose in the power  of God reproved and rebuked wickedness before the  people in the name of the Lord God. He wished  to say a few words to suit the condition of the general  mass. "And I shall speak with authority of the  priesthood in the name of the Lord God, which  shall prove a savior of life unto life or of death  unto death.  Notwithstanding this congregation profess to be  Saints yet I stand in the midst of all characters  and classes of men. If you wish to go whare God  is you must be like God or possess the principles which  God possesses for if we are not drawing towards God  in principle we are going from him and drawing towa rds the devil, yes I am standing in the midst of  all kinds of people. Search your hearts and see if  you are like God. I have searched mine and feel to  repent of all my sins. We have theives among us  Adulterers, liars, hypocritts, if God should speak  from Heaven he would command you not to  steal, not to commit Adultery, nor to covet, nor  deceive but be faithful over a few things  As far as we degenerate from God we desend  to the devil and looses knowledge and without knowle- dge we cannot be saved and while our hearts are filled  with evil and we are studying evil their is no room  in our hearts for good or studying good, is not  God good, yea then you be good, if he is faithful  then you be faithful.

As soon as meeting closed multitu des crouded around me, many hands were presented  on evry side to bid me farewell, many calling for me  to bless them before I leave them, others crying  out do lay hands on me and heal me before you go.

My head is in great pain wont you heal me.  I want you to consecrate these bottles of Oil before  you go.

Remember me to Mrs Margarett Morgan) Good by, I have been waiting a long time to get a  chance to speak to you:: THESE and a thousa nd other questions were asked me in the term of  an hour or more, and I needed as much wisdom  as Solomon to be a councellor in the midst of such  a scene, And which when I left the chapel  many were still waiting for a little council upon a  variety of subjects which they did not get for  the want of time many parted with me with tears  in their eyes, many of the Brethren and Sisters followed  me to Turkey Hall whare I spent the night, and filled  the house untill a late hour Begging council and  instruction at my hand among whome was a  Baptist Minister, who had just been baptized  and ordained a Priest.
