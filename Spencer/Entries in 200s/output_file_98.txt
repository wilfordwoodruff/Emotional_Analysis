Just now I cannot answer you com-  pletely, however, for these reasons:    I am teaching school here in Montpelier   Idaho. Promised to teach 9 months. To  keep my promise I would have to remain  until the last of May.    Yesterday I went to see the trustees about   it but they could not give me a definite  answer. It is my opinion that they   intend to keep school until the last of  April.    Now in case they are not willing to   let me off until the last of April, cou  would it be acceptable for me to leave  sometime in the latter part of May.  I woshould like to visit a week or two with  my parents at home, before leaving for my   mission.    I think, that in about two weeks

 Cambridgeport Mass Feb 22nd 1849    Elders G. A. Smith, & E. T. Benson,   Dear Brethren,    I recieved your interesting letter of  Dec 20. directed to me & have penned your letter to Elder   Barnes of Jan 11: both of which contained cheering news  from the valley. I should have answered your letter before  this time, but I have been sick near two weeks, but am well as  usual again And I wished also to see if I could make any discoveries  in your favor for assistance before I write. The Lord knows that   I wish it was in my power to put means into your hands to make  you comfortable in removing to the valley in the Spring, it certainly  would afford me pleasure, But I have not the means in my power  or at my control, yet if I can use an influence with any man  who has means for your Benefit I will do it. It does not help  men any in your cituations to plead poverty or tell poor stories  yet I will give a brief sketch of affairs as I now find them in the  East. I am making a report to the presidency in the valley which  I expect to send by Orson Spencer who is expected in New York [nad]  daily. I have kept a list of the Branches of the Church in the East &  including, [Pennsylvania|paensylvania, & Eastern part of New York, with all of New England  Canidas New Brunswick Novia Scotia &c & in fine all throughout my   field of labour and I make out 804 in all 604 besides the Philadelphia Branch  that is called 200 this representation includes Saints, Mormons, Hickory mormons  & all Hot, warm, & cold. I have tryed to ascertain as well as I could  their temperal circumstances and if I can judge from their report  I would not judge that one half or more than that could pay  their fare to St Louis. When I arrived in Boston I found many  complaining beacause Elder Badelam had done so much for the Church  & had got in deabt debt He was $1400 in debt when He returned from  philadelphia and even a number of the brethren have been almost  ready to Devour him on accout of it, but after Hearing all the  circumstances concerning it I have felt it my duty to come out  Defend him & sustain Him & I have done so. And He has finally  been prospered & has mostly cleared himself from debt, the last

So Elder Barnes is the ownly man  left in the Boston Branch that has any thing more than enough  to pay his fare to the Bluffs, ownly 8 malle members left in the  Boston Branch, those who have means to pay their fare to St Louis  & the Bluffs are are expecting to go west as fast as they can.

I presented the letters before him from Dr Richards  requesting him to advance means to pay those debts of the presidency  for those goods obtained at the Bluffs. Soon Elder Cordon came  as an Express with letters from Elder Hyde to him upon the  same subject. He said He had no money by him ownly enogh  to help him home to Merimichi but He would consider  the subject. He asked some council of me concerning going  west I advised Him to follow the council of the Epistle He   said He would do it. I got a letter from Him awhile  since saying that He had no oppurtunity yet to sell, that His property  was worth £5000 but what He could get for it He could not tell  but calculated to sell & go to the west this next summer He  said He should Have a settlement in His business once a year which

Yours Truly  Wm. H. Wilkison.    I presume we will have to accept his  "reclination" (declination) as we have no  choice in the matter.

 would be the first of March He could then tell what would  be His help. on I am expecting to see him in the spring & write  to Him soon, and if any thing opens that I can rely on  for your assistance I will let you know immediately. their  may be men that Have money in philadelphia or Western NY  but I do not know them. I will talk with Elder Barnes upon  the subject, & if I can stir him up to do any thing I will.  As to myself I have to exercise my thinking powers strongly in order  to get bread for myself & family & pay my fare in travelling the pond  of the Churches in the East seems to be out And almost every man  man that comes East to preach to the world has to live upon  the Churches. But that does not help you any nor me Neither  so I will drop the subject. The gold fever still rages as bad as  ever ships are Now clearing daily from New York & Boston  ports, loaded to the brim with gold digers, some 200 ships have  left for that port to dig gold. I do not mean the ships will dig gold, but the  people that went in them. Nearly all the America shiping will  turn from most all other trade & go to that country. Hundreds  are now preparing for that country, & tens of thousands men.  I tan am now expecting O Spencer from Liverpool to be in New York  soon I shall go to see him if the Lord will. I am not baptizing   much in this Eastern Country, for three Sabbaths past I have  held meetings in Cambridgeport, I have 3 candidates for baptism  here whenever we can find any water it is all Starrotyped now in   this country with Ice, one of them is an intelligent gentleman  from Switzerland I think He may be useful some day to go to  his own country to preach the gospel. The work continues  to progress rapidly in England I should think from all accounts  they were adding nearly 1000 per month in that country. I was truly  rejoiced to hear the ne[ws] from the valley. Do the presidency intend  to take any measures for a Territorial or State government I have watched  the Bills that have come up during the present session very closely but   I do not think any Bill will pass this session for any of the country.  Slavery is the great Bone of contention, & now presents a formidable  appearance & is a laying firm foundation for the disolution & anhi  annihilation of the American Government. Are we ever going to   to see A Frontier Guardian? That the Lord will open your way  to get what money you need to go to the valley wis is the prayer of    Wilford Woodruff

 until their sons and daughters go   into these holy places and redeem them, as  Jesus went to preach to the spirits in  prison three days and three nights,  while His body lay in the tomb. Some  of them had laid there a long time—  thousands of years—up to the time  when Christ was crucified and His  Spirit went to them in prison.    President Woodruff then proceeded  to enlarge upon the blessings enjoyed  by the Latter-day Saints in regard to  their work in the Temples, and said he  rejoiced in the knowledge that the  Prophet Joseph Smith, President  Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball  and others formerly associated with  them in this great latter-day work on  the earth were rejoicing today at what  they saw and heard. The shout of  "Hosanna" would enter into the  presence of God, and they would re-  joice thereat. So far as we carried out  the purposes which God had placed  upon us, and the responsibilities de-  volving upon us, when we got through  here we should have the privilege on  the morning of the resurrection of  sitting down with Abraham, Isaac and  Jacob, and those of our relatives who  had already passed away in the family  organization of the celestial world for  ever and ever.

 Wayne Stake of Zion.    PRESIDENTS' OFFICE    WILLIS E. ROBISON.  HANS M. HANSON.  GERSEN S. BASTIAN.    LOA, WAYNE COUNTY, UTAH Jan 24th 1898    President Wilford Woodruff Salt Lake City    Dear Brother we hereby take  the liberty of saying to you in regard to Elder John C Jacobs of the  Teasdale ward in this stake, who expects to go on a mission next   spring, that we feel that brother Jacobs will be of little value as  a traveling elder in the field on account of his physical condition,   his health is not good, and he is subject to some kind of heart  affliction by spells, that in our Judgement would be sufficient  grounds for a release from his call, coupled with this while he is  making preperations to respond to the call, yet in our opinion  he seems to feel quite downcast about it, which is probably  on account of his health more than any thing else. Bro. Jacobs  is a good man and a willing worker in the kingdom, and we wrote  you some time ago asking permission to use him as bishops counsellor,   but we made another selection instead. But we now feel to present his  condition to you as stated above, so if you should feel to release him   it might be done before he arranged his business during his  absense, or disposed of some property to help cary him to his  field of labor, that he would not other-wise dispose of trusting  you will pardon these suggestions, we remain your brethren in the gospel    Willis E Robison  Hans M. Hansen  Gersen S Bastian    On this howing by all means   honorably release him.   J. F. S.

 Logan Tab. Sunday Sep. 12, 1877  Singing. Prayer by Bp. W. B. Preston    Elder Woodruff arose and stated that he felt   thankful for the privelage of meeting in the basement  story of this magnificent tabernacle. Alluded to the demise  of Pres. Young and commended his good example of faith-  fulness and diligence through all his life, and admonished  the saints to be faithful in the building up of Zion in  these mountains, refered to the labors of the prophet Joseph  Smith, and set forth the many visitations of holy Angels  which he received confering upon him the holy priesthood,  by which he was enabled to organize the Church.  And was also enabled to translate the Book of Mormon,  and introduced the Gospel in its fulness to this gen-  eration. Showed that the Almighty had assisted  him in all his labors, and enabled him to overcome  all opposition until the church was fully organized.  Although he was continually in deep water; brought upon  him by ungodly men. And after his work was   done he sealed his testimony with his blood, as did  nearly all other prophets of former times. Yet although  he was slain and departed from this earth, the King-  dom of God has moved steadily onward. Alluded to  the time when the Prophet Joseph taught the Twelve   the many truths which the Lord had revealed to him,  as also the order of the keys of the various dispensations  of God to man. Reviewed the history of the entrance  of Pres. Young into these barren sterile mountains, and  showed how the blessings of God had accompanied  his administration until his death and portrayed  the great work which he had accomplished, and remarked   that during the sickness of Pres. Young, he in connection  with many of the saints in St. George engaged fer-  vently in prayer for his restoration, but it was the  will of the Lord that he should go hence, and now  that he had departed he felt Glad that he had  died in peace among his family and friends.    Spoke of the labors of Pres. Young during the  past winter at St George and set forth the assiduity  with with which he performed and accomplished the  same. Refered to the many thousands of spirits in  the spirit world, the redemption of whom rests upon  the Latter day saints, and expressed his satisfaction   of his labors at St. George, and discoursed of the [num-]  [sus] he had preceeded in the ordinances for his dead,  and set forth the importance of the ercetion of holy  temples, and related much of his experience in the  temple of St George, in which he had great joy  and satisfaction. Admonished the saints to faith-  fulness and invoked the blessings of God upon them.

 a cow of mne turned up with  the Hancock & Tenny Brand on  fresh; When it became known that  it was my cow both Geo, & Thomas  came to me with offers to pay for  the cow but of course I told them   the Law would have to take its  course & the consequence is there  is an Inditement out against  George & Thomas is one of the  main witnesses; Now I believe  that Thomas is heartily  sorry for the part he  took in helping to brand  my cow yet I could not  have recommended him as a  representative to carry,  the Gospel to the world,  being rather immature  & even lacking in Discretion  however according to 
 Elder W. Woodruff, next addressed the Saints and spoke of the  fact, that God in the organization of his Church had appointed one  man to receive revealations to guide the church, which however  did not, debar every man to enjoy revealation for himself & his  family Set forth the necessity of being [purposed] continually of the  Spirit of revelation, and remarked that were we to give heed  to our first impressions & consence to do so, it would become  a spirit of revealation, and remarked that were we to do give heed  to us such, were the viccor of the Prophet Joseph. Referred to   the recent death of a son of Bro. Burnham, and presented  the query, how is it & for what purpose has he been called away  for what purpose did God call away one of his Sons, about a  year ago he having asked the Lord for so doing, it was made  known to him that the Lord had need of them, in the spirit world  to labor in the interests of the redemption of our dead, we were  laboring here this side of the veil, and they were now engaged  on the other side in the same great work.    Spoke of the death of nearly all those who were engaged in the  organization of the Church, spoke of the certainty of death, that  everything by which we were surrounded indicated change  and we would go hence and might with the  departed dead and there find our harvest, bore a strong  testimony of the work of God.    And touched upon the corruption of the present generation  and spoke of the interest that all holy men who had ever lived  was taking in the great work, in which we are engaged  impressed the blessings of the Lord upon the Saints; and desired  to redeem his dead, and prepare himself to go hence, for  we had only a few short years to remain here in the flesh,  Admonished the Saints to remember their prayers & increase   and exercise our faith in the befalf of our nation, Government  and delegates to Congress. 
 Elder W. Woodruff, addressed the Saints and discoursed upon  the subject of the almighty peopling this earth with his sons  and daughters and his dealings with them Spoke of the  various dispensations and especially of this last one being  more important in which he required his Saints to build  Holy Temples where in they could enter & officiate for the  living & the dead, treated upon the Labors of the Saints  since the time the angel gave the records of Ephraim to  Joseph touched up the various harships the Saints  had endured through all of which our Father had carried  us through triumphantly remarked that the Saints  should be faithful & grateful for all his blessings of which  we enjoy & labor diligently for the establishment of the  Kingdom of God, admonished the Saints to be interested  in the erection of our Temples. Spoke of the abundant  crops the Lord had blessed us with. Alluded to the  presence of grasshopers and recommended the Saints  to be wise and make good use of the blessings showered  upon us. 
 Pres Woodruff spoke of the condition of Bro. M. Thatcher as an  apostle who is now about to leave for Mexico as also Pres.  Cannon for washington to extention in faith and prayers in  their absence. Meeting. AdJourned Benediction by Lorin. Farr. 
 Pres W Woodruff wished he had the power of language, to reach  the hearts of the Priesthood that they might be brought to a proper  understanding of the situation we occupy. He touched on the  absince of the Priesthood from the earth for nearly 1800 years  until restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith & the vast number  of souls now upon the earth, to all of whom the Gospel must be  preached either in this life of the next. He treated on the great  work to be performed in the matter of the redemption of the dead, to do what   the Saints must not pander to the vices & evils of the world. He dwelt on the  importance of building Temples & officiating for the dead & spoke of the anxi-  ety of the dead in their Salvation, relying perhaps on one single person who  holds the Priesthood & who may be indifferent to the great work expected of him  If such a person knew what his situation was, he would at once desist from  his evils & prepare himself to do the work expected of him. The whole world  is opposed to the Saints, but God & Jesus are with us & for us & so are all  good men. He spoke of the ignominy that befalls all those who oppose  this work & the servants of God. The Spirit of God is now resting on the  Saints & this work is advancing & time is advancing. God required this  people to carry this Gospel to the nations & to prepare mankind for the  coming of the Son of Man, & to warn mankind of the judgements pending  over the nations. He urged the Saints to let saloons alone to be valiant  for the truth & let the consequence follow. 
 Pres W Woodruff desired to speak to the Saints in regard to a few  of the mysteries of the Kingdom, which God had sestablished in this  our time & on the temporalities of the people. He showed the necessity  of establishing Home industries, the need of which may not be so appa-  rent now as it will be & portrayed the probability of a coalition between  the political parties of this nation which would be dis^as^trous to their  interest & existence, then commerce & industries would be destroyed & the  importation of goods would cease. We should be wise & prudent & pro-  vide against this evil day & store up grain against the day of famine. He  favored the raising of stock & swine, also cereals, wheat beans & other hardy  products & thus fortify ourselves against the day of trouble, when the judge-  ments shall overtake this nation. He feels a change will take place in this  nation, which has the most liberal government on earth, in which  however the blood of the elders have been spilt, which had not been  done in any other nation on the earth & because of this God had de-  creed to destroy this nation. He dwelt at some length on the signs  of the times & depicted the corruption of this nation. He set forth  the folly of going into debt & advised the Saints to pay their debts &  be wise. He referred to some remarks, made by Bp Farrell  in regard to the young men in Smithfield some of whome were  rude & rebellious. He queried if his boy was one of such. He  described his character from which it was found he was not one of them.  He spoke of the interest felt in the spirit world in our welfare &  were anxious that we see after their welfare & perform these ordinances  of the Gospel for them, that are necessary for their Salvation & exaltation.  He referred to the anxiety the Prophet Joseph felt in this matter & on  the importance of the labors in the Temple. He treated on the law of adoption  & cautioned the Saints to be careful in this matter. He thought there had   been too much wildfire in this affair & cited a case in point.    Speaking of the redemption of the dead, he stated that the oldest member  of a family holds the key for the redemption of the dead. He illus-  trated the course to be pursued in redeeming the dead, to seal together  those who are equally meritorious & who died without the Gospel.    He mentioned many items of great interest respecting this great  subject & touched on many interesting things pertaining to the best inter-  ests of the Saints. 
 Pres Woodruff addressed the Saints remarking that for nearly  five years he had not had this opportunity, but he was yet  dependent on the Spirit of God to guide him in his remarks.    He referred to his reception yesterday as very pleasing  & spoke of a visit he had made to Logan 28 years ago, at  which time he prophesied that a temple would be built here  which has been fulfilled. Many of those who were then present  are now in the Spirit world. He spoke of the powers & prerogetive  that was conferred on the prophet Joseph, that he stands at the  head of this dispensation. The priesthood that is given us relates to  the Celestial Kingdom & our salvation depends on keeping within  the power & influence of that priesthood. He spoke of the folly  for any one to imagine that the church will fall without his aid &  presance, for all such will be mistaken. This work will go on inde-  pendent of any man. He referred to the material blessings that  surrounded the Saints in contrast with the circumstances that  attended them in other countries. He alluded to the warfare that arose  when the Prophet Joseph announced the vision of the Lord to him.  That warfare continued & will to the end. He dilated upon the bles-  sings & glories, that will come to the faithful in the end. He referred  to the marvellous preservation of his own life for which he felt   very thankful. He directed his remarks to the young men, many  of whom are disposed to draw away from the restraint & directions  of the priesthood. He cautioned them not to do so, as the time they  do so, that is when they will go astray & outside of the powers &  blessings of the priesthood. He expressed the desirability of   having our children keep faithful for in them depends the carrying  foward this work. He narrated some little of his boyhood experiences  & early manhood, which was quite interesting. 
 President Woodruff narrated in detail the circumstances that  existed in Kirtland when so many apostatised giving great trials  & troubles to the Prophet Joseph. Half of the quorum of the Twelve  fell away & all these circumstances gave evidence that we must  rely on the Almighty in all our labors & that truth & fidelity  are the only safeguards to salvation. He admonished the saints  to avoid the Spirit that induced that apostacy & to seek the spi-  rit of God to guide us aright. He narrated his mission to Fox  Islands with others, where he baptised 100 souls & organ-  ised a branch & God was with them. He spoke of the death  of Joseph & Hyrum & the [ink splot] [illegible] events connected with it. He   also alluded to the death of David Patton & the death & dep-  arture of many of the Twelve, with other great men who died in  the faith, but he never felt to mourn for them because they  had done their work. He spoke of the return of many to  the church who had fallen away, but were not the men they  were before. He spoke of the doctrine of Baptism for the dead  & asserted its grandeur & validity, & the perpetuity of the marriage  covenant &c. He discoursed on the United Order & said he believed  in that order & stated that if ever we enter the Celestial Kingdom  it will be in that order. He narrated the establishment of the U-  nited order in Sunset & in Brigham City. These things have passed  & have been abolished not because the principle is wrong but  because the people were not prepared for it. He urged the Saints  not to sell their homes. He felt to say, Wherever there are a  people ready to enter the United order he would enter into  it & if there is an element here in Logan prepared to go into that  order, he would appoint Apostle Moses Thatcher to supervise  it. He bore a faithful testimony to the truth of the work of  God upon the earth 
 Pres Woodruff said the Savior declared that if we were not one  we are none of his. This people ought to be one & be united. In the  Celestial Kingdom we shall find no disunion. He spoke of his  early experience in the church. He referred to the fervor of Oliver   Cowdery at one time in bearing his testimony, but he went into  darkness as did others who raised up their hands against the  Prophet Joseph. He feared disunion in any part of the church. He  explained the benefits & advantages of union & faithfulness. He re-  ferred to the woeful condition of those who have once stood  high in the church & afterwards apostatised. He spoke with  much anxiety for the welfare of the church & the unification  of the people. He remarked that the signs of the times indicate  the coming of the Son of Man & all the purposes of God will be   accomplished in this dispensation. He related a dream in which  he saw the Prophet Joseph in the Spirit world where he found  all were in a hurry & on questioning him as to this condition   of things, he was informed by the Prophet that the time was so  short to make preparations for the coming of the Son of man that   they must be in a hurry to get ready. He related some other   interesting incidents arising in his experience. He exhorted the  Saints to get the Spirit of the Lord, for without it we are not  safe. He spoke of the love of the Priesthood that exists & should  exist with the Saints & the impropriety of mourning over the  death of a righteous man. He felt great anxiety for our young  men many of whom were going astray. He hoped the Sisters  would avail themselves of the blessings of the Association organized  for their benefit. 
 Pres Woodruff desired to say a few words on the subject of  the Priesthood. Perhaps sometimes language was not used  sufficiently clear in the ordination of persons to the Priesthood    He referred to the last time the Prophet Joseph gave  instructions to the twelve Apostles as a quorum.    He bore record to the remarks of Pres Smith that  they were true & correct. He counselled the Saints to make   a little change in their way of doing as the time was  drawing nigh for the Lord to cut His work short in   the last days lest no flesh be saved    He said the Home Missionaries should be called to  labor in a similar way to the Elders who go abroad  to the nations of the earth, that they should go from  house to house & visit all who have a standing in the church    He referred to the young & rising generation & what their  duties were. He urged them all to refrain from the evil  habits that prevailed amongst us & to learn to pray both in secret  & in their families & for all to strive to fulfill our callings here  on the earth 
 Pres Woodruff said this government was founded on two  national parties, the Republicans & Democrats. He endorsed   the remarks of Pres Smith. He advised the saints not to   quarrel or have strife one with another, but should choose  either party as it suited their belief, but not to allow it to take  them from their faith in the Gospel. He referred to his remarks   made at the Priesthood meeting last night relative to the man-  ner of settling difficulties. He advised all to make settlement  of their difficulties & trouble among themselves & not carry them  before the Bishop or High Council. He made reference to the  Priesthood & Apostleship held by the Prophet Joseph Smith    He spoke of the completing of the Salt Lake Temple & desired   the Saints of this stake to unite & assist with their means  to that end. The meeting was then adjourned. Singing. 
 your request I have  signed his letter to you  but do not wish to be held  responsible for him as  rquired in the Instructions  to Bishops on these matters;   However I do not wish it  understood that I question  the authority of the Apostles  to call whom they Please  only when they do it they  should take the responsibili  ty of it and not ask me  to; Now Thomas may make   a good missionary: he is very  willing & I would not like  to throw a straw in his  way trusting that all will  turn out right in this  matter I am as ever, &Co    Z.

 President Woodruff said he wanted to make a short political  speech. Said a man could be latter day saint and also blelong  to either political party. He advised all to cease their bitterness toward  each other and to confine themselves to truth. We should not enter  into any personal attacks and speak evil of each other  He had experienced great pleasures in attending this Conference. The people  of these valleys were greatly blessed of the Lord both temporally and  spiritually. Referred to the financial condition of the country but thought  Utah would compare with any other section of the country very favor-  ably. Exhorted the saints to live lives worthy of Latter day saints and  serve the Lord in faithfulness. 
 President Woodruff was well pleased to again mingle with the saints  of this stake in conference. Had been very much edified by the remarks made  this morning. The subjects spoken upon were very important to the saints  Referred to the wickedness of all kinds that is filling all the world. The Evil  One was doing all in his power to engulpf the children of men. The voice of   the servants of God has been sounded in these days to all the world where  the conditions and laws would permit as this audience bore testimony of it  today. In all dispensations of the Gospel the Devil has tried to overcome  the servants of God. We should all labor and guard against the attacks and  temptations which the adversary made upon us, and by resisting them  we would gain strength over the evil one. Referred to the early days of the church  and the opposition the Prophet Joseph and his associates received from the people  in their day. Spoke of the Judgements of God which should come upon the  children of men in consequence of their refusal to accept the Gospel of Christ.  Spoke of the feelings and spirit now manifest by the people of this nation towards  the saints. Referred to the recent visit of the First Presidency to Chicago and   Jackson County, Mo. with the Tabernacle choir and spoke of the kind receptions they  met with on that trip which all showed that a change had come over the Nation.  Exhorted the saints to faithfulness in keeping the commandments of God. 
 Asahel H Woodruff  Answered June 27 [18]84    Manchester May ^June^ 1 [18]84    Dear Father  I trust this letter will find   you in good health as it leaves me at  present. I recieved your verry welcome  letter dated May the first just after posting  the last letter I wrote you. As regards what   I saw at the Falls, will say they landed us  at Cliftan at 9 PM, this is on the Canada  side and so we had a ride across the suspen-  sion bridge; we remained in the cars all night.  Early morn found us making our way up  to the Fall a distance of one mile & 1/2. The air  was so full of mist that we could not gain  as good a view as if it had ben clear, still  the great volumes of watter coming over the  horse shoe falls presented a grand sight and  one calculated to inspire a green Utah boy  with awe. These falls are 1800 ft across with  a fall of 160 ft, the sheat of watter is 23 ft thick  in the thickest part. A young man from Arizona  and I went down under the falls, it was a thrilling 
 [Sideways text]  Received Feb 1  [End of sideways text]    Asahel H Woodruff  No 5 St Johns St  Buckland Portsmouth  January 10 [18]845    Dear Father    I take pleasure in   addressing a few lines to you this  weet drizzleing morning I have not  received a letter from home for   upwards of two weeks. My last to  you was written from the office  in London two weeks ago this morning  which I trust you received all  right. On Monday morning Pres Lund  assigned me to the Portsmouth branch  to labor with elder Denney. Bro Geo  Dent and I spint a partian of Monday  in the British Museum, and then took  a walk around to see the Abby and  Parlimentary buildings Tuesday   morning I pack up my valise and   take the train for my new field arriv-  ing here about one oclock to find  that elder Denney had gone to Southam 
 Asahel Nov 11 [18]84   Answered Dec 5 [18]84    Mr Harrups Residence  Tintwistle    Nov 11 [18]84 Derbyshire    Dear Father    Once more finding  myself at liberty to do so I take pleasure  in addressing a few lines to you.  Your welcome letters of bearing  dates Oct 7th & 16th came duly to hand  and were carefully perused, and I  am thankful for your words of  advice & caution and shall endea-  vour to make reparation in the future.  Since my last to you written from  Audley Staffordshire I have been  into Manchester for several days,  while there I attended a tea party  given by the Saints of that branch  in our meeting house. We sat down  to the tables at 5:30 PM and after  partaking heartily of the good things  so tastefuly prepared by an efficient  committee composed of local pretheren and  sisters, we repared to a lower room  where the intellectual feast consis-  ting of addresses, songs, recitations &c 
 Asahel H Woodruff  Oct 18 [18]84  Aswd Nov 7 [18]84    16 Talbot St Leek  Staffordshire Eng  Oct 13 [18]84    Dear Father:    It is with a great amount  satisfaction that I reply to your very  excelent letter of the 22nd let^inst^, but to tell  the honest truth I hardly know what to  write about. When I undertake to write  a letter I find it is hard work to think  of any thing new to write. I see it is quite  different with you, but then I suppose  you would sooner have a poor one  than none at all. After leaving the place  where I last addressd you (on the 6th I believe)  I wanderd into Derbyshire to a town  rejoicing under the appellation of Glossop  arriving there about five oclock and  finding an open market in the centre of  the town with a very inviting appearance  for a meeting I determined to hold one  though afoot & alone. There are no Saints  in the town and not a soul did I know  out of the thousands that might be seen  hurrying to and fro on the streets. Many  sro were the thoughts that flitted through 
 A H Woodruff  Oct 13 [18]84  Asd Nov 7 [18]84    13 [18]84    Father.    If I said to Bro Wagstaff  that I had not yet learnt to travel  without purse or script I did not  want to infer that I was without money  on the contrary I told him I had means  And I dont see anything wrong in the  remark, for I have not got faith that  the best man living can travel in this   country to day without purse or scripts.  In the early days of the church when  an Elder arrived a collection was made  for him a suit of clothes and there were  plenty of Saints where he could get food,  but to day it is a very few pennies that  one receives from the Saints for they  are so poor and are so few and far  betwen that we have to buy a good  deal of our food & pay for our lodgings.  I have heard men preach from the  stand that they would sooner send  a son of theirs out without pe a dollar 
 Asahel Sept 13 [18]84    16 Talbot St. Leek  Staffordshire  Sept 13 [18]84 England    Dear Father    Your kind and welcome  letter dates Aug 26th was recieved by  me yeasterday on my arrival here  I have ben greatly shocked to hear of  the massacre of the Elders in Tennesee  It seems hard that innocent law  abiding citizens should be shot down  in cold blood by a ruthless mob for  no greater offense than declaring the  acceptable day of the Lord. If a Mormon  has the daring presumption to go  about minding his own business  why he ought to be shot for doing  so seems to be the verdict in the  South. We find men in our travels  who are possessed of the same veno-  mous spirit and would not hes-  itate at treating us with violence  only that they are affraid of the law  which is vindicated in this country  far better than in America. Here the  poor man gets the bennifit of the law- 
 Chicago Ill Apr 17 [18]84    Dear Father & Mother    We arrived  here yeasterday morning @ 7, took the   buss for the Brevoort House, charterd   a room for the four of us & proceded   to take in the town. We visited first the  Panorama, this is a work of art by Paul  Philippoteaux inclosed in a large octogan  shaped building, you enter on the wright  & ascend a winding stair way until  you finaly emerge on a sort of platform  near the top of the inside of the stucture. when  you behold the troops of the Union & Federal  armies engaged in the thick of the fight of  the memmoriable battle of Gettysburg. So  realistac doses it sum that one believes  he is standing on the battle ground instead  of viewing it on canvas. This painting  covers 20000 sq ft of canvas it is 50 ft  high & 400 ft long cost $150,000. From here  we walked over to Michigan Avenue  this street runs by the lake & is the Br[page torn]  of chicago, here is located the aristocr[page torn] 
 Show this to President Cannon  I will accord with what he says.  J. F. S.    I think he should be free from  indictment.
