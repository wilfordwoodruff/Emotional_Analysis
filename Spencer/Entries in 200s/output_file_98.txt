 Cambridgeport Mass Feb 22nd 1849Elders G. A. Smith, & E. T. Benson, Dear Brethren,I recieved your interesting letter ofDec 20. directed to me & have penned your letter to Elder Barnes of Jan 11: both of which contained cheering newsfrom the valley. I should have answered your letter beforethis time, but I have been sick near two weeks, but am well asusual again And I wished also to see if I could make any discoveriesin your favor for assistance before I write. The Lord knows that I wish it was in my power to put means into your hands to makeyou comfortable in removing to the valley in the Spring, it certainlywould afford me pleasure, But I have not the means in my poweror at my control, yet if I can use an influence with any manwho has means for your Benefit I will do it. It does not helpmen any in your cituations to plead poverty or tell poor storiesyet I will give a brief sketch of affairs as I now find them in theEast. I am making a report to the presidency in the valley whichI expect to send by Orson Spencer who is expected in New York [nad]daily.

I have tryed to ascertain as well as I couldtheir temperal circumstances and if I can judge from their reportI would not judge that one half or more than that could paytheir fare to St Louis. When I arrived in Boston I found manycomplaining beacause Elder Badelam had done so much for the Church& had got in deabt debt He was $1400 in debt when He returned fromphiladelphia and even a number of the brethren have been almostready to Devour him on accout of it, but after Hearing all thecircumstances concerning it I have felt it my duty to come outDefend him & sustain Him & I have done so. And He has finallybeen prospered & has mostly cleared himself from debt, the last

I am not baptizing much in this Eastern Country, for three Sabbaths past I haveheld meetings in Cambridgeport, I have 3 candidates for baptismhere whenever we can find any water it is all Starrotyped now in this country with Ice, one of them is an intelligent gentlemanfrom Switzerland I think He may be useful some day to go tohis own country to preach the gospel. The work continuesto progress rapidly in England I should think from all accountsthey were adding nearly 1000 per month in that country. I was trulyrejoiced to hear the ne[ws] from the valley. Do the presidency intendto take any measures for a Territorial or State government I have watchedthe Bills that have come up during the present session very closely but I do not think any Bill will pass this session for any of the country.Slavery is the great Bone of contention, & now presents a formidableappearance & is a laying firm foundation for the disolution & anhiannihilation of the American Government. Are we ever going to to see A Frontier Guardian? That the Lord will open your wayto get what money you need to go to the valley wis is the prayer ofWilford Woodruff

 until their sons and daughters go into these holy places and redeem them, asJesus went to preach to the spirits inprison three days and three nights,while His body lay in the tomb. Someof them had laid there a long time—thousands of years—up to the timewhen Christ was crucified and HisSpirit went to them in prison.President Woodruff then proceededto enlarge upon the blessings enjoyedby the Latter-day Saints in regard totheir work in the Temples, and said herejoiced in the knowledge that theProphet Joseph Smith, PresidentBrigham Young, Heber C. Kimballand others formerly associated withthem in this great latter-day work onthe earth were rejoicing today at whatthey saw and heard. The shout of"Hosanna" would enter into thepresence of God, and they would re-joice thereat. So far as we carried outthe purposes which God had placedupon us, and the responsibilities de-volving upon us, when we got throughhere we should have the privilege onthe morning of the resurrection ofsitting down with Abraham, Isaac andJacob, and those of our relatives whohad already passed away in the familyorganization of the celestial world forever and ever.

BASTIAN.LOA, WAYNE COUNTY, UTAH Jan 24th 1898President Wilford Woodruff Salt Lake CityDear Brother we hereby takethe liberty of saying to you in regard to Elder John C Jacobs of theTeasdale ward in this stake, who expects to go on a mission next spring, that we feel that brother Jacobs will be of little value asa traveling elder in the field on account of his physical condition, his health is not good, and he is subject to some kind of heartaffliction by spells, that in our Judgement would be sufficientgrounds for a release from his call, coupled with this while he ismaking preperations to respond to the call, yet in our opinionhe seems to feel quite downcast about it, which is probablyon account of his health more than any thing else. Bro. Jacobsis a good man and a willing worker in the kingdom, and we wroteyou some time ago asking permission to use him as bishops counsellor, but we made another selection instead. But we now feel to present hiscondition to you as stated above, so if you should feel to release him it might be done before he arranged his business during hisabsense, or disposed of some property to help cary him to hisfield of labor, that he would not other-wise dispose of trustingyou will pardon these suggestions, we remain your brethren in the gospelWillis E RobisonHans M.

 Pres W Woodruff wished he had the power of language, to reachthe hearts of the Priesthood that they might be brought to a properunderstanding of the situation we occupy. He touched on theabsince of the Priesthood from the earth for nearly 1800 yearsuntil restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith & the vast numberof souls now upon the earth, to all of whom the Gospel must bepreached either in this life of the next. He treated on the greatwork to be performed in the matter of the redemption of the dead, to do what the Saints must not pander to the vices & evils of the world. He dwelt on theimportance of building Temples & officiating for the dead & spoke of the anxi-ety of the dead in their Salvation, relying perhaps on one single person whoholds the Priesthood & who may be indifferent to the great work expected of himIf such a person knew what his situation was, he would at once desist fromhis evils & prepare himself to do the work expected of him. The whole worldis opposed to the Saints, but God & Jesus are with us & for us & so are allgood men. He spoke of the ignominy that befalls all those who opposethis work & the servants of God. The Spirit of God is now resting on theSaints & this work is advancing & time is advancing. God required thispeople to carry this Gospel to the nations & to prepare mankind for thecoming of the Son of Man, & to warn mankind of the judgements pendingover the nations. He urged the Saints to let saloons alone to be valiantfor the truth & let the consequence follow. 
 Pres W Woodruff desired to speak to the Saints in regard to a fewof the mysteries of the Kingdom, which God had sestablished in thisour time & on the temporalities of the people. He showed the necessityof establishing Home industries, the need of which may not be so appa-rent now as it will be & portrayed the probability of a coalition betweenthe political parties of this nation which would be dis^as^trous to theirinterest & existence, then commerce & industries would be destroyed & theimportation of goods would cease. We should be wise & prudent & pro-vide against this evil day & store up grain against the day of famine. Hefavored the raising of stock & swine, also cereals, wheat beans & other hardyproducts & thus fortify ourselves against the day of trouble, when the judge-ments shall overtake this nation. He feels a change will take place in thisnation, which has the most liberal government on earth, in whichhowever the blood of the elders have been spilt, which had not beendone in any other nation on the earth & because of this God had de-creed to destroy this nation. He dwelt at some length on the signsof the times & depicted the corruption of this nation. He set forththe folly of going into debt & advised the Saints to pay their debts &be wise. He referred to some remarks, made by Bp Farrellin regard to the young men in Smithfield some of whome wererude & rebellious. He queried if his boy was one of such. Hedescribed his character from which it was found he was not one of them.He spoke of the interest felt in the spirit world in our welfare &were anxious that we see after their welfare & perform these ordinancesof the Gospel for them, that are necessary for their Salvation & exaltation.He referred to the anxiety the Prophet Joseph felt in this matter & onthe importance of the labors in the Temple. He treated on the law of adoption& cautioned the Saints to be careful in this matter. He thought there had been too much wildfire in this affair & cited a case in point.Speaking of the redemption of the dead, he stated that the oldest memberof a family holds the key for the redemption of the dead. He illus-trated the course to be pursued in redeeming the dead, to seal togetherthose who are equally meritorious & who died without the Gospel.He mentioned many items of great interest respecting this greatsubject & touched on many interesting things pertaining to the best inter-ests of the Saints. 
 Pres Woodruff addressed the Saints remarking that for nearlyfive years he had not had this opportunity, but he was yetdependent on the Spirit of God to guide him in his remarks.He referred to his reception yesterday as very pleasing& spoke of a visit he had made to Logan 28 years ago, atwhich time he prophesied that a temple would be built herewhich has been fulfilled. Many of those who were then presentare now in the Spirit world. He spoke of the powers & prerogetivethat was conferred on the prophet Joseph, that he stands at thehead of this dispensation. The priesthood that is given us relates tothe Celestial Kingdom & our salvation depends on keeping withinthe power & influence of that priesthood. He spoke of the follyfor any one to imagine that the church will fall without his aid &presance, for all such will be mistaken. This work will go on inde-pendent of any man. He referred to the material blessings thatsurrounded the Saints in contrast with the circumstances thatattended them in other countries. He alluded to the warfare that arosewhen the Prophet Joseph announced the vision of the Lord to him.That warfare continued & will to the end. He dilated upon the bles-sings & glories, that will come to the faithful in the end. He referredto the marvellous preservation of his own life for which he felt very thankful. He directed his remarks to the young men, manyof whom are disposed to draw away from the restraint & directionsof the priesthood. He cautioned them not to do so, as the time theydo so, that is when they will go astray & outside of the powers &blessings of the priesthood. He expressed the desirability of having our children keep faithful for in them depends the carryingfoward this work. He narrated some little of his boyhood experiences& early manhood, which was quite interesting. 
 President Woodruff narrated in detail the circumstances thatexisted in Kirtland when so many apostatised giving great trials& troubles to the Prophet Joseph. Half of the quorum of the Twelvefell away & all these circumstances gave evidence that we mustrely on the Almighty in all our labors & that truth & fidelityare the only safeguards to salvation. He admonished the saintsto avoid the Spirit that induced that apostacy & to seek the spi-rit of God to guide us aright. He narrated his mission to FoxIslands with others, where he baptised 100 souls & organ-ised a branch & God was with them. He spoke of the deathof Joseph & Hyrum & the [ink splot] [illegible] events connected with it. He also alluded to the death of David Patton & the death & dep-arture of many of the Twelve, with other great men who died inthe faith, but he never felt to mourn for them because theyhad done their work. He spoke of the return of many tothe church who had fallen away, but were not the men theywere before. He spoke of the doctrine of Baptism for the dead& asserted its grandeur & validity, & the perpetuity of the marriagecovenant &c. He discoursed on the United Order & said he believedin that order & stated that if ever we enter the Celestial Kingdomit will be in that order. He narrated the establishment of the U-nited order in Sunset & in Brigham City. These things have passed& have been abolished not because the principle is wrong butbecause the people were not prepared for it. He urged the Saintsnot to sell their homes. He felt to say, Wherever there are apeople ready to enter the United order he would enter intoit & if there is an element here in Logan prepared to go into thatorder, he would appoint Apostle Moses Thatcher to superviseit. He bore a faithful testimony to the truth of the work ofGod upon the earth 
 Pres Woodruff said the Savior declared that if we were not onewe are none of his. This people ought to be one & be united. In theCelestial Kingdom we shall find no disunion. He spoke of hisearly experience in the church. He referred to the fervor of Oliver Cowdery at one time in bearing his testimony, but he went intodarkness as did others who raised up their hands against theProphet Joseph. He feared disunion in any part of the church. Heexplained the benefits & advantages of union & faithfulness. He re-ferred to the woeful condition of those who have once stoodhigh in the church & afterwards apostatised. He spoke withmuch anxiety for the welfare of the church & the unificationof the people. He remarked that the signs of the times indicatethe coming of the Son of Man & all the purposes of God will be accomplished in this dispensation. He related a dream in whichhe saw the Prophet Joseph in the Spirit world where he foundall were in a hurry & on questioning him as to this condition of things, he was informed by the Prophet that the time was soshort to make preparations for the coming of the Son of man that they must be in a hurry to get ready. He related some other interesting incidents arising in his experience. He exhorted theSaints to get the Spirit of the Lord, for without it we are notsafe. He spoke of the love of the Priesthood that exists & shouldexist with the Saints & the impropriety of mourning over thedeath of a righteous man. He felt great anxiety for our youngmen many of whom were going astray. He hoped the Sisterswould avail themselves of the blessings of the Association organizedfor their benefit. 
 Pres Woodruff desired to say a few words on the subject ofthe Priesthood. Perhaps sometimes language was not usedsufficiently clear in the ordination of persons to the PriesthoodHe referred to the last time the Prophet Joseph gaveinstructions to the twelve Apostles as a quorum.He bore record to the remarks of Pres Smith thatthey were true & correct. He counselled the Saints to make a little change in their way of doing as the time wasdrawing nigh for the Lord to cut His work short in the last days lest no flesh be savedHe said the Home Missionaries should be called tolabor in a similar way to the Elders who go abroadto the nations of the earth, that they should go fromhouse to house & visit all who have a standing in the churchHe referred to the young & rising generation & what theirduties were. He urged them all to refrain from the evilhabits that prevailed amongst us & to learn to pray both in secret& in their families & for all to strive to fulfill our callings hereon the earth 
 Pres Woodruff said this government was founded on twonational parties, the Republicans & Democrats. He endorsed the remarks of Pres Smith. He advised the saints not to quarrel or have strife one with another, but should chooseeither party as it suited their belief, but not to allow it to takethem from their faith in the Gospel. He referred to his remarks made at the Priesthood meeting last night relative to the man-ner of settling difficulties. He advised all to make settlementof their difficulties & trouble among themselves & not carry thembefore the Bishop or High Council. He made reference to thePriesthood & Apostleship held by the Prophet Joseph SmithHe spoke of the completing of the Salt Lake Temple & desired the Saints of this stake to unite & assist with their meansto that end. The meeting was then adjourned. Singing.

 President Woodruff was well pleased to again mingle with the saintsof this stake in conference. Had been very much edified by the remarks madethis morning. The subjects spoken upon were very important to the saintsReferred to the wickedness of all kinds that is filling all the world. The EvilOne was doing all in his power to engulpf the children of men. The voice of the servants of God has been sounded in these days to all the world wherethe conditions and laws would permit as this audience bore testimony of ittoday. In all dispensations of the Gospel the Devil has tried to overcomethe servants of God. We should all labor and guard against the attacks andtemptations which the adversary made upon us, and by resisting themwe would gain strength over the evil one. Referred to the early days of the churchand the opposition the Prophet Joseph and his associates received from the peoplein their day.

When I undertake to writea letter I find it is hard work to thinkof any thing new to write. I see it is quitedifferent with you, but then I supposeyou would sooner have a poor onethan none at all. After leaving the placewhere I last addressd you (on the 6th I believe)I wanderd into Derbyshire to a townrejoicing under the appellation of Glossoparriving there about five oclock andfinding an open market in the centre ofthe town with a very inviting appearancefor a meeting I determined to hold onethough afoot & alone. There are no Saintsin the town and not a soul did I knowout of the thousands that might be seenhurrying to and fro on the streets. Manysro were the thoughts that flitted through

If a Mormonhas the daring presumption to goabout minding his own businesswhy he ought to be shot for doingso seems to be the verdict in theSouth. We find men in our travelswho are possessed of the same veno-mous spirit and would not hes-itate at treating us with violenceonly that they are affraid of the lawwhich is vindicated in this countryfar better than in America.
