In one instance I was  requested to attend a Conference or Council of the  quorum of the Twelve in the case of Orson Pratt  I was weak &amp; feeble yet I thought I would try to  meet with them with the expectation that they  would meet at Elder John Taylors who was  also vary low with the Billious fever but on our  arival at his house he was so vary feeble he was  not able to have it there so it was remove to  President B. Young  conveyed me in his carriag to the place of  meeting but I had not been in the house more  than 10 minutes before my strength began to  fail me I lay down upon a bench but had no  sooner lain down than I was gone my breath  stoped, my Brethren raised me up took me to the  door into the air &amp; with the assistance of water  air &amp;c I was brought to breath again but not without  a hard struggle between life &amp; death the Breth- ering lade hands upon me &amp; Br Hyram Smith  prayed for my recovery I soon began to breathe  free but I was deprived of all my strength  they convey me home, it being a warm time  I was much troubled for breathing through most  of the night &amp; it took me several days to recover  my former strength.   things transpired in the Church we received  the word of the Lord concerning the  Elders of the Church (through Joseph the  Seer) The Lord manifested that it was  his will that the first presidency, the  Twelve, The High Council The quorum  of High Priest, and the Elders quorum  as a general thing should go into  the vineyard. The instructions were  for the Elders to confine themselves to the  ENDENTRY  &amp; the Canidas not to go to any of the indians  or Slave States. The result was that a  special conference was called &amp; three or  four hundred Elders were called upon to  go into the vineyard &amp; about 400 Elders have  since gone &amp; many others are going their  has never at any time been as great a  turn out into the vineyard since the  foundation of the Church, Br J. Taylor &amp; my- self are the ownly ones of the Twelve that  have not gone out into the vineyard we being  sick could not go besides it was thought  wisdom for us to continue in the printing  Business. There was a Counsel of the  Twelve held for four days with Elder  Orson Pratt to labour with him to  get him to recall his sayings against Joseph  &amp; the The Twelve but he persisted in his  wicked course &amp; would not recall any of his  sayings which were made in public against  Joseph &amp; others sayings which were unjust  &amp; untrue.

He said the reason of these remarks being made, was, that  some little thing was circulating in the Society, that some  persons were not going right in laying hands on the sick &amp;c,  said if he had common sympathies, would rejoice that the  sick could be healed, that the time had not been before that  these things could be in their proper order that the church  is not now organized into its proper order, &amp; cannot be until  the temple is completed - - - Pres Smith continued the  subject by adverting to the commision given to the ancient apos- tles "Go ye into all the world &amp;c" ##Mark 16:15##- no matter who beleiveth;  these signs, such as healing the sick, casting out devils &amp;c,  should follow all that beleive wether male or female.  He asked the society if they could not see by this Sweeping  stroke that wherein they are ordained it is the privilege  of those set apart to administer in that authority which is  conferred on them &amp; if the sisters should have faith to  heal the sick, let all hold their tongues, &amp; let every thing  roll on.   an instrument to lead the church, why not let him lead  it through? Why stand in the way, when he is appointed to  do a thing? Who knows the mind of God? Does he not  ENDENTRY  that he was continually rising - altho' he had every thing  bearing him down, standing in his way &amp; opposing - after all  he always comes out right at the end.   there could be no devil in it if God gave his sanction by healing  that there could be no more sin in any female laying hands  on the sick than in wetting the face with water that it  is no sin for any body to do it that has faith, or if the sick  has faith to be healed by the administration.   with the management of concerns - saying if he undertook to  lead the church he would lead it right - that he calculates  to organize the church in proper order &amp;c.   he had to surmount ever since the commencement of the  work in consequence of aspiring men, "great big Elders" as he  called them, who had caused him much trouble, whom he  had taught in the private council: &amp; they would go forth into  the world &amp; proclaim the things he had taught them; as  there own revelations - said the same aspiring disposition will  be in this Society - &amp; must be guarded against - that every  person should stand &amp; act in the place appointed, &amp; thus  sanctify the society &amp; get it pure.   piring Elders, for all were infected with that spirit, for  instance J. Page had been aspiring  they could not be exalted but run away as tho' the care &amp;  authority of the church were vested with them - he said he  had a subtile devil to deal with &amp; could only curb him  by being humble.   going to instruct the Society &amp; point out the way for them  to conduct, that they might act according to the will  of God - that he did not know as he should have many  opportunities of teaching them as they were going to be  left to themselves, they would not long have him to  instruct them, that the church would not have  his instruction long, &amp; the world would not be troubled  with him a great while, &amp; would not have his teaching.  He spoke of delivering the Keys to this Society &amp; the church  that according to his prayers God had appointed him  ENDENTRY    their faith and prayers for, &amp; place confidence in those  whom God has appointed to honor, whom God has  placed at the head to lead that we should arm them  with our prayers, that the keys of the Kingdom are  about to be given to them that they may be able to de- tect every thing false, as well as to the Elders.   know it; you must immediately put it away. The  Sympathies of the heads of the church have induced them  to bear with those that were corrupt; in consequence  of which all become contaminated, you must put down  iniquity &amp; by your good example provoke the Elders  to good works, if you do right no danger of going too fast:  he said he did not care how fast we run in the path  of virtue, resist evil &amp; there is no danger, God, men, angels,  &amp; devils, cant condemn those that resist every thing  that is evil - as well might the devil seek to disthrone  Jehovah as that soul that resists every thing that  is evil.   natures, it is natural for females to have feelings of charity  you are now placed in a situation where you can act  according to those sympathies which God has planted  in your bosoms.   glorious! if you live up to your privilege, the angels  cannot be restrained from being your associates - -  females if they are pure &amp; innocent can come into  the presence of God, for what is more pleasing to God  than innocence, you must be innocent or you can  not come up before God, if we would come before  God let us be pure ourselves. The devil has great  power, he will so transform things as to make one  gape at those who are doing the will of God.  you need not be teasing men for their deeds, but  let the weight of innocence be felt, which is more  mighty than a mill stone hung about the neck.  Not war, not jangle, not contradiction, but meek- ness, love, purity, these are the things that should  magnify us. - Achan must be brought ##Joshua 7:19-26## ENDENTRY  or herb bearing seed, should bring forth after its kind  &amp; cannot come forth after any other law or princi- ple. Upon the same principle do I contend that  Baptism is a sign, ordained of God for the  believer in Christ to take upon himself in order to  enter into the kingdom of God, "for except  you are born of the water &amp; the spirit you cannot  enter into the kingdom of God, saith the Savior, as  It is a sign of command which God hath set for  man to enter into this  seek to enter in any other way will seek in vain, for  God will not receive them neither will the angels  acknowledge their works as accepted, for they have  not taken upon themselves those ordinances &amp; signs  which God ordained for man to receive in order to  receive a celestial glory, &amp; God has decreed that all   damnation of hell. What is the damnation of  hell, to go with that society who have not obeyed  his commands. Baptism is a sign to God, to Angels to heaven that we do the will of God &amp; their is  no other way beneath the heavens whareby  God hath ordained for man to come  other cource is in vain. God hath decreed &amp; ordained that man should repent of all his sins &amp;  Be Baptized for the remission of his sins then he  can come to God in the name of Jesus Christ in  faith, then we have the promise of the Holy Ghost   the laying on of hands, is the sign or way  marked out by James &amp; the custom of the  ancient saints as ordered by the Lord &amp; we  should not obtain the blessing by persuing any  other course except the way which God has marked out.   the Holy Ghost through any other means except  the sign or way which God hath appointed, should  we obtain it certainly not all other means would  fail. The Lord says do so &amp; so &amp; I will bless so &amp; so  their is certain key words &amp; signs belonging to  the priesthood which must be observed in  order to obtaine the blessings ENDENTRY  for the remission of sins, with the promise of the  gift of the Holy Ghost &amp; in no other way is  the gift of the Holy Ghost obtained. Their is a  difference between the Holy Ghost &amp; the gift of the  Holy Ghost. Cornelius received the Holy Ghost before  he was baptized which was the convincing power  of God unto him of the truth of the gospel, but  he could not receive the gift of the Holy Ghost  untill after he was baptized, &amp; had he not taken  this sign or ordinances upon him the Holy Ghost which convinced him of the truth of God would  have left him, untill he obeyed these ordin- ances &amp; received the gift of the Holy Ghost by the  laying on of hands according to the order  of God he could not have healed the sick or  command an evil spirit to come out of a  man &amp; it obey him for the spirit might  say to him as he did to the sons of Seava &amp;  Peter I know &amp; Christ I know but who  are ye   or short after we come to a knowlede of these princi- ples &amp; obey them. I know that all men will be  damned if they do not come in the way which God  has appointed   merly say that all men will come from the grave  as they lie down, whether old or young their  will not be added unto ther stature one cubit neither  taken from it. All being raised by the power of God  having the Spirit of God in their bodies &amp; not blood Children will be enthroned in the presence of God  &amp; the Lamb with bodies of the same stature that  were on earth. Having been redeemed by the  Blood of the Lamb they will there enjoy a fulness  of that light Glory &amp; intelligence which is receiv- ed in the Celestial kingdom of God. "Blessed are the  dead who die in the Lord, for they rest from their ENDENTRY    assembly before him to humble themselves in faith  before God, &amp; in mighty Prayer &amp; fasting to call  upon his Holy name, untill the elements were  purified over our heads &amp; the earth sanctified under  our feet that the inhabitants of this city may  escape the power of the disease, pestilence &amp; destroyer  that rideth upon the face of the earth &amp; that the  holy spirit of God may rest upon this vast multitude   the congregation that he should attend to the  ordinance of Baptism in the  house at 2 oclock. And at the appointed hour  the bank of the missisippi was lined with a multitude  of people &amp; President Joseph Smith went  forth into the river &amp; Baptized with his own  hands about 80 persons for the remission of  their sins &amp; what added Joy to the scene the  first person Baptized was Mr L.D. Wason a  nephew of Sister Emma Smith the first of  her kindred that have embraced the fulness of  the gospel. At the close of this interesting scene  the Administrator lifted up his hands towards  heaven &amp; implored the blessing of  rest upon the People, &amp; truly the spirit of  God did rest upon the multitude to the Joy &amp; consolation of our harts. After Baptism  the congregation again repaired to the grove  near the Temple to attend to the ordinance of  Confirmation &amp; notwithstanding president Smith  had spoken in the open air to the people &amp; stood  in the water &amp; baptized about 80 person about 50  of those baptized received their confirmation  under his hands in the after part of the day, &amp; during the intermission of these meetings their  was probably as many more Baptized &amp; confirmed  for their Dead relatives at the Font By the Twelve And those who wish for further information  concerning the scenes of the Sabbath in Nauvoo or any other day in the week I would say to all  such come &amp; see.

A  large assembly met in the grove near the Temple  Br Amisa Lyman addressed the assembly &amp; made  many interesting remarks. He was followed by  Joseph the Seer who made some edifying remarks  concerning baptism for the dead. He said the Bible  supported the doctrin, "why are ye baptized for  the dead if the dead rise not &amp;c" if their is one word  of the Lord that supports the doctrin it is enough to make  it a true doctrin. Again if we can baptize a man in the Name of the Father of the Son &amp; of the Holy Ghost  for the remission of sins it is just as much our privilege  to act as an agent &amp; be baptized for the remission  of sins for &amp; in behalf of our dead kindred who have not  herd the gospel or fulness of it.

It may be the case  with me as well as you.

I would say to the mourners that  death has made his heaviest stroke at you for should  he take either of the parents away from the rest  of the family it would set them down in the king- dom of God with their son Ephraim, the speaker  remarked that the death of this young man had made  a vacancy in his heart that nothing could fill untill  it was filled by restoring the society of the same  person in eternity which is the case in loosing any  friend. All the remarks were vary appropriate that were  made on the occasion.
