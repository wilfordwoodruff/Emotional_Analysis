One man comes and sayes my family will not be subject to  me another woman says my husband abuses me and I want a bill  to get away from him and a thousand complaints come poreing in  upon me none of which I should hear if the people lived by the  spirit of God you should all obtain the spirit of God and overcome  your passions when you get angry you should put a peace of  Indiaruber in your mouth and bite it untill you could get perfect  controll over your passion do not speak while you are angry for  you will say sumthing that you will be sorry for but if you will keep  your thoughts to yourself when you are angry they will not become  the property of another. Any person who is acquainted with me knows  that I have controll over myself I do not speak in anger to my  wives, children or the people. I make all my Passions be in subjection to the priesthood and the spirit of God. people cannot fulfill their  calling and do their duty unless they are filled with the Holy Ghost I do not know that there is a female in Israel who is worthy of the  appellation of a Mother in Israel for any woman to raise up children  unto the Lord as they should do they should be filled with the Holy Ghost  when they concieve seed and continue filled with the Holy Ghost  untill the child is born and weaned then the Mother should have the Holy  Ghost to teach the child untill He is Grown up so the Father should  be filled with the Holy Ghost when he begetts a child and he also should  be filled with the Holy Ghost in order to train up that child right then  it will be Holy unto the Lord and will have power with God. these are  true principles. the saints should bring all there passions in subjections  to the Law of God I am learning evry day I live, I see some that  will bear a testimony that they know that Joseph was a prophet   ENDENTRY and the Book of Mormon is true and this work is of God and yet if any thing is said  that comes contrary to their selfish dispositions they will manifest the  most stoubern will and will not yield one hair from what their wicked  dispositions dictate.

Woodruff. Elder Snows  mind run in a vary interesting channel the spiritual atmosphere seemed  to be heavy when he ^a^rose but the spirit of God came upon him and he  spoke in a vary edefying and interesting manner the following remarks wer Elder snow was written from memery   Brethren I rise to occupy a short time I realize that there is a feeling  with nearly all of this people that there is sumthing of great importance  awateing this people some think that we will be beset by a great mob  from the states others that we would have an insurrection in our midst  and others sumthing Els now of if the people really knew that we would be met  by a mob and that our lives depended upon our being well armed you would see this people sell their coat or shirt to buy revolvers and weapons so  as to defend their wives children and their own lives but I am satisfyed  that there are scenes awaiting this people that will require all the grace and  wisdom which we can muster to pass through in safety. now for instance  this people are makeing a great rush to President Youngs office to get wives  sealed to them on sunday night President Young sealed men and women  till it was time for the prayer circle to meet then He had to turn a room full out of Doors to wait another time this spirit is increasing throughout  this Territory now do those who are taking so many wives realize that  it will want a great Deal more power with God the Holy Ghost and wisdom to preside over that Houshold than it does to go to the nations and preach the gospel, build up Churches and organize them and preside over and controll  them, if they do not realize it it is true, now here is this great body  of seventies and every other Quorum of this church should labour hard  to arm yourselves with all the power of God you can get in order to save  your families if you do not if you do not you will soon find a  stampede with your wives you cannot hold them they will break  from you you I need the wisdom of the Gods to rest upon you to save  your families for if you do not have great wisdom you will  meet with trouble. you have many wives and children this woman   ENDENTRY wants a gown that one a Bonnet the next one shoes and their children  clothing and one thinks she Has to do more than her part and this one will  not do what she should andc and the man has got to stand in the midst  of his family like a God in order to calm the troubled waters and safe  them. A man may Go to a ward meeting and preach and the power of God  is upon him he comes home he finds one woman scolding and freting  another one in tearess, another one complaining and the children  fighting and by the time he gets well in the midst of it hith faith  courage and patience almost fails him, and he has to rise up in the majesty  of a God as it were and have Great wisdom faith and patience and exercise  much Generalship and show himself a master spirit and a savior and a  Fatherly care and kind ness in order to save his wives and children. Here  is a mission for you ye Elders of Israel. Look for instance at the example  of president Young go into his house and take lessons see him with his  great family of wives and children and se the God like character and exam- ple of that man and the order which he manifests in his family I  tell you if it was not so you would see a stampede suddenly in that  House but He is a great master spirit and manifests great wisdom  in the perfect order of Government with his numerous family of  wives and children, they all respect him and obey his law for the wisdom  of God is with him. Now brethren strive to bring yourselves to the same  standard become a patriarch over your own Household and seek to  save them connected with order you have to become a financere  and you have to support your wives and children and you want to live  so that you can call upon God to increase your flock heards and  crops this brethren is the greater work which you have to prepare  your minds for almost any fool can go and preach the gospel but  it requires a vary wise man to be a patriarch and save his own  household. Many other interesting remarks were made which I  have not room here to record   W Woodruff followed and said I have been much instructed with the word  of Elder Snow his words are true as the gospel and I bear testimony of its truth  I am watching the spirits of men we come and meet with the seventies and  with all other Quorums of the church from the 12 down and watch the spirits and  give instruction as the spirit dictates this is not ownly our right andbut duty  Here is before me a vast body of 70sseventies the minds of this body of men  must be fed your presidents should be filled with the spirit and power of God  so that they can attend all the meetings and feed them and give unto them the  mind and will of God if they do not do this they will die and cannot stand  for the minds of these seventies must be fed but many of them who  have been ordained into these Quorms have not prized the prieshhood  which they have had sealed upon them many times they have been so  anxious to go and attend to some trifling thing that they could not stop  long enough to be ordained at least as soon as the hands were off  they would run and not stop to give their genealogy many of the Elders  of this Church have trifled with the priesthood. there is now a  call made to gather up all the Elders priests Teachers and Deacons that are  ^not^ esspecially ingaged as teachers with the Bishops to come forward and be  ordained into the seventies now it does appear to me that the Lesser  priesthood is necessary in the church otherwise the Lord would not have  esstablished it. the Headd cannot say to the feet we have no need of you  no more than the feet can say to the head we have no need of you. almost  all the Lesser priesthood are striveing to become ordained into the seventies  while the bishops wish them to officiate in the Lesser priesthood. * see the star on the other page   ENDENTRY February 3, 1857  ~ Tuesday   3rd I spent the day in the office writing Letters to correspondence andc I  attended the Bishops meeting in the evening at the seventies Hall we had a  good meeting Bishop Lorenzo Snow who preached  nearly the same sermon that he did last night to the 70s meeting I  followed him and bore testimony to the truth of what he had said I  was followed by Bishops Little    ENDENTRY February 4, 1857 ~ Wednesday   4th FIGURES I finished my Letters to my correspondence I  I wrote 6 Letters to the Mormon, Standard, Star, J M.

Richards in conversation and had a plesant  interview together. FIGURE I received two papers of pear and Apple pie mellon seeds  from C C Rich    ENDENTRY February 5, 1857 ~ Thursday   5th A snowey day. I spent a part of the day writing and reading I attended  a trial before the High Counsel and 13 ward of Brother Capaner that was  cut off from the Church after Hearing the testimony of both parties and  remarks from the councellors and decision of president Spenser, then  President Young delivered an address to the people a synopsis of  which was taken by Brother Bolton delivered to me and filed in the  Historians office. He said a Bishop and his councillors might cut  off a man from the church whether any of the ward voted or not  He said should the people follow a Bishop yes if he is a righteous  man and does right but if he teaches wrong things and does wrong the  people should not follow Him but when this is the case let the people  thunder out the truth as it is then the bishop will see it but unless the people can point out some better way let them follow the bishop. see Boltons report   * (From the back page) The Bishops feel to complain and say the seventies  take all of the Lesser priesthood which we have and ordain them seventies  so by the time we get some teachers organized they are ordained to  the office of seventies. The seventies also complain that the Bishops  come and take away their presiding officers and the seventies and make  bishops and councellors of them and ordain them High priest so their  appears to be a difference of feeling in the several Quorums in  order to avoid this I would recommend that the Teachers Priest and  Deacons all that the Bishops wish to make use of as teachers in the several Quorum remain as they are untill they have magnifyed their  calling and not evry man as soon as he is ordained a teacher go and get  ordained a seventy and hide himself in that mighty forest of men  so that He cannot be found For the seventies are like a forest  trees of all kinds from the tallest down to the shrubery and men  get lost in such a forest men should not despise the lesser priest- hood for it is honorable and if they fully magnify that office they  will have great power and many blessings for the Aaronic priesthood  hold the keys of administering of Angels and their has been but few men even High Priest or Apostles that have enjoyed all the blessings  that belongs to the Lesser priesthood. Then Let not the seventies seek  to get all the Lesser priesthoods ordained into ther quorums if they  do I do not wish them to complain if seventies are taken out  to Make Bishops councillors and teachers of them as long as nearly  all the timber is in that body. Let a man have what portion  of the priesthood He may He wants to keep it in lively exercise in  order to save himself and family *)   ENDENTRY February 6, 1857 ~ Friday   6th I spent the day in the office and evening conversing with the board  of Directors of the Agricultural society    ENDENTRY February 7, 1857 ~ Saturday   7th I spent the day in the office and the attended the High priests meeting  in the evening.

B L Clapp and Lorenzo Snow spoke at length and I followed Him and had a good meeting   ENDENTRY February 17, 1857 ~ Tuesday   17th FIGURE In company with Young and asked him what I should do whare council was asked  of me either by the 70s or Bishops. Joseph Young said to the Quorum of seventies that when they were called to be Bishops or councillors that they might still retain their place as Presidents of the seventies and  not be ordained High Priests. Bishop Hunter thinks that they should Be ordained Bishops and High Priest. what shall I do about it. President Young said if  they would go their ^way^ and hold there tongue about it they might stand as they  are and act as Councellors to a Bishop, but if they will not, ordain them I said I thought that men ought to walk in the channel pointed out for them and not complain about it President Young said yes let them do as they are told. I spent the day in the office reading History and councelling Elder L Snow and F. D. Richards was with me a part of the day. I attended the  Bishops meetings in the eveing. Bishop Hunter spoke and I followed him I told the Bishops to impress upon the minds of the people the necessity of living their Religion after this date for if the people again commit  sin after being forgiven as they now were they would not again be forgiven but the Justice of the Law would be brought against  them and they would have to pay the penalty or be cut off from the  Church again I told them they should not boast of their authority  and power or that a seventy was greater than a High Priest or that a  High Priest was greater than a seventy no man should boast of the power of the priesthood untill he obtained some of that power and it was manifested upon him and when that was upon him he certainly  would not boast of it for the Holy spirit would teach him sens enough  to know better. It is vary seldom that I have known the power of  the presiesthood made manifest upon the Children of men in our day to a vary great Degree but in some instances it was manifest as in the case of the prophet Joseph at the time his house was full of the sick and dying and his door Yard and they were strewed along the bank of the River  for 2 miles and Joseph Rose up and shook himself like an old Lyion and commenced at his own tent door and healed all the people who was not dead on both sides of the river by the power of God his voice was  as the voice of God and the earth almost trembled under his feet as he com- manded the sick to arise and be made whole. It was also manifest with  Joseph while made fast in chains and in prision in Missouri and his wicked ungodly persecuters gathered around him and while he was made fast in chains with his chains Brethren yet they goaded his feelings by boasting  of how many murders they had commited and rapes upon mormon women  and how they had cut the mormons to peices then they would blaspheme the name of God untill his spirit was reigned up and he rose up in the power of God in the midst of his chains and spoke as in the voice of thunder "Silence  ye fiends of the pit. I will not live another moment and hear such vile  language from mortals, either you or I shall die right here or els you shall scease from boasting of shall such damnable deeds as you are guilty of."  They quailed before his words like leather wilting in the flames and they bowed before him and made acknowledgements to him this was done by the power of God. "Again David Patten was taken by an armed mob under a United States warrant and when he was surrounded with an armed mob of about 40 men under the garb of Law and would not let him say one word in his own defence but he arose in the power of God and held them fast to their seats  untill he addressed them about 1/2 an hour he told them they were cowards  rascals and villans and he proved it to them, and they had not power to harm a hair  of His head and they let him and Warren Parrish go, away. Again this power was manifest with President Brigham Young on the bank of the Missouri River at Winter Quarters when the merchants brought up goods to sell to the brethren   ENDENTRY who were going to the mountains. Old Major Miller the Indian Agent was  surrounded by officers and Miller in order to show his great power He told the merchants that owned some Alcohol not to roll a Barrel of liquor off from the boat that He would knock the head in and spill it upon the ground president  Young steped up and told the men to roll it out and if miller spilled it that moment I will spill his clarret He and all the officers turned pale the liquor  was rolled out and nobody hurt. And other instances might be named when  the power of the priesthood has been manifest but these men have never  boasted of it nor never will I made many other remarks. I was followed  by Lorenzo Snow who spoke well.    ENDENTRY February 18, 1857 ~ Wednesday   18th I spent the day in the F. D. Richards and E. Hunter was in the office and conversed upon many things. I copy the following report from the presidency a month since. He said that is (President Young) that He wished the Brethren at Kimball  said that I dont want to see the Presidents of the seventies in the stand untill they get more of the spirit of God for they are dead and the seventies have to receive  their food through them. Brother Young said I do not wish to have Father Morley not to seal any more men and women without my consent I was troubled with the teeth ake.

Brother Cummings says that the mountains are much higher than here that shows that the vallies  are lower than here. Those places are filled with streams and the streams  with fish and the fish with Eggs.   The subject of Claytons printing some revel- ation and keys came up President Young said that He thought He should  put a stop to people printing matter without his knowledge at their press I attended the 14th ward meetings, the House was full.

He is watching  this people and he is watching us as leaders and teachers and he knows almost every thing which is going on throughout the Church and kingdom of God and if he sees us doing the same things which he would do and teaching the same doctrin He is pleased with us and seese that we are in the right path.

President Young had O Pratts pamphlet read called the Holy Spirit and he made the following remarks after hearing it read He said that Brother Pratt had got beyong beyond the  stars He had Carrelled them and got beyond them   FIGURE President Young asked Wm W Phelps by what authority he had proclaimed in Public that He (Brigham Young) was the man that  the Lord said he would raise up like unto Moses "Phelps said Joseph was gone and you are left to lead the People.

Orson Hyde said there was a man in Provo professed to have a visit from a Departed spirit he comes to him dressed in his temple Robes and the man he comes to has not had his endowments and I want to know what you think of it I thought the whole of it smelt strongly of Brimstone   President Young said now if the people in Provo can be made to believe that that is a true visit about the third time he comes He will say that this Church is not led by the man that ought to lead  it but the man that has thos visits will tell you that he is to lead the Church. Now I will tell you how you may know it is fals a spirit  will not come to a man in the flesh without he appears in his glory and men cannot endure his glory a resurrected body may come  and hide his glory. but that visitation is false it is not true   I went to the 14th ward school House to meeting O Hyde and many  others were there as missionaries several spoke I followed with few remarks and was followed by O Hyde    ENDENTRY March 9, 1857 ~ Monday   9th I spent the day in the office mostly I set out some trees and  grape vines    ENDENTRY March 10, 1857 ~ Tuesday   10th I set out currant Bushes and grape vines I spent a part of  the day in the office I attended the missionary meeting in the evening  and had a good time I spoke a short time at the close of the meeting   ENDENTRY March 11, 1857 ~ Wednesday   11th I spent the fore part of the day setting out vines and currants the after noon in the office    ENDENTRY March 12, 1857 ~ Thursday   12th I set out 5 Almonds and 25 peach trees one Apricott and one  plum in my Garden this fore noon I spent the afternoon in the office    ENDENTRY March 13, 1857 ~ Friday   13 I spent the day in the office    ENDENTRY March 14, 1857 ~ Saturday   134th I spent the fore part of the day Grafting Apples and pears the  afternoon I spent in the Young called in and Herd  History read nearly all the afternoon He heard a part of his  own history read, and a part of the continuation of the History of the  the Death of A.

In the afternoon President Young spoke a vary  interesting sermon from the following text "who is my Father Mother  Brothers and sisters they are those who do the will of my father which  is in heaven." ##Matthew 12:50## I attended the prayer Circle. President Young  said he had the following dream. I thought we had a great  crop of wheat the whole Earth was filled with it all around the  Heads were very long and there was so much of it the people  did not seem to care any thing about it, did not try to save  it I had to continually urge the people to save the wheat they  said they had more than they wanted for this year I told them  to go to and save all the wheat they had then next year they could  work on the Temple."   President said that the King Philip corn was nothing more than the  Jumbo Corn some man plants an acre and takes great care of it and  he gets a great crop of it, the way they got corn so early they  will take the ear that sets first and pull the silk out of all the rest  then plant the but part of that Ear and that will make early corn  now that is the way with the best breed of cattle, they keep picking  out the best for stock, and that increases the goodness of them. Owen  wanted his society to adopt this plan to take all the noble men  and women and raise up a society when they had a dwarf send him  away   President Young said to Elder O Hyde you have been to both  Jerrusalem and Zion and seen both I have not seen either for I  never have been in Jackson county now it is a plesant thing  to think of to know whare the old garden of Eden is did  you ever think of it, or sens it, I do not think many do, now  Jackson County is the Garden of Eden, Joseph has declaired this  and I am as much bound to believe it as much as I am to believe Joseph is a prophet of God, many in Jackson county have found out  that they cannot cultivate the Temple Block and other places in that  county we must let the Lord take his own time to prepare the way  for our return to that county and to build up that Temple   16 I spentI went to the 15 ward and preached during the evening to the people    ENDENTRY March 16, 1857 ~ Monday   16th I spent the day in the office writing I attended the meeting  of the seventies in the evening. Brother Joseph Young spoke to the people in a vary edefying manner exhorted them to get the spirit of God   ENDENTRY and Edify the people He was followed by W. Woodruff I told them that I felt  like bearing testimony to what brother Joseph had said his teachings  were Just and true. You cannot edify this people without you speak by  the Holy Ghost a man may have all the Eloquence of a Cicero or  the knowledge of the world combined and he cannot feed the immortal  mind of a Latter Day saint unless he speaks by the spirit of God. He may talk of visions and revelations or any thing Els unless he has the spirit  of God He will not edefy this people look at the teaching of the prophet  Joseph all other men might preach though many might preach by the  spirit of the Lord and Edify the people yet if the people knew that Joseph  was going to preach the people would poor out of their houses like bees out of a Hive. So with President Young at this day if the people knew  that He was going to preach they would fill the Tabernacle an hour before  the time of meeting. his words are plain and easy but they are filled  with the spirit and power of God unto Edification   I was followed by F. D. Richards who spoke well unto Edifycation    ENDENTRY March 17, 1857 ~ Tuesday   17th I spent the day in the office on the History of the Twelve and  found great difficulty in obtaining any thing for the History of  those who had apostitized. I attended the meeting of the Bishops  Bishop Hunter spoke and said he wished the clerk to keep a strict  Account of their meetings as it would make a good History He  councilled the Bishops to finish the canal and do all that is required of  them. Joseph Young spoke said that was the first time that He ever  attended a Bishops meeting in his life He spoke vary well I followed  him FIGURE The following is a Brief synopsis of my remarks I said I felt  to say a few words we have had a good exertation from Brother Joseph  Young He said some had thought that we should have the privilege of  coming to thes vallies and setting down and resting but he thought that we had  as much to do as ever I think so to I am thoroughly converted to  the faith that we shall never arive at that period of existance when  we shall not have sumthing to do I believe our work will increase  throughout all Eternity though we may not have to gain our bread  by the sweat of our brow neither shall we always have to cultivate  the soil in the midst of thornes and briers. Our Father in Heaven is  always busy his kingdom and works are increaseing and I believe it  will be the same with us throughout all Eternity if we are saved. There  is another subject which I wish to speak of. Brother Hunter said that  He wanted the clerk to keep a record of their meetings as it would  make a good History this is a subject I have always felt interested in and as there are many branches in the kingdom of God so their should  be some persons engaged in each branch I have often spoken upon  this subject and I have often thought that to many it was dry and  uninteresting to many I mean the subject of Journal writing and keeping  a history of what transpires with us from day to day. I was deeply  impressed with the importance of this subject to day while reading the History  of the organization of the quorum of the Twelve and the remarks of the  Prophet Joseph upon the subject. He said -"I have for myself learned a fact  by experience which on reflection gives me much sorrow. It is a truth  that if I now had in my possession evry decission which has been given  upon important items of Doctrin and duties since the rise of this church  they would be of incalculable worth to the saints but we have neglected  to keep a record of such things thinking perhaps that they never  benefit us afterwords which had we now would decide almost   ENDENTRY any point that might be agitated and now we cannot bear record  to the Church nor unto the world of the great and glorious manifestation  that have been made to us with that degree of power and authority  which we otherwise could if we had those decissions to publish abroad  FIGURE Since the Twelve are now chosen I wish to tell them a course which they may persue and be benefited here after in a point of light  of which they perhaps are not now aware. At all times when  you assemble in the capacity of a council to transact business let the  oldest of your Number preside and let one or more be appointed to keep  a record of your procedings and on the decission of evry important  item let it be what it may let such decission be noted down and  they will ever after words remain upon record as LAW covenants  and doctrin. Questions thus decided might at the time appear unimportant  but should they be recorded and one of you lay hands upon them after  words you might find them of infinate worth not ownly to your  brethren but a feast also to your own souls"    "Should you assemble from time to time and procede to discuss import- ant (subjects) or questions and pass decissions by and by upon them and  omit to record such decisions by and by you will be driven to straits  from which you will not be able to extricate yourselves and not being  in a situation to bring your faith to bear with sufficient perfection  or power to obtain the desired information. Now in consequence of  a neglect to write these things when God revealed them not essteeming  them of sufficient worth the spirit may withdraw and God may be angry  and here is a fountain of intelligence or knowledge of infinate  importance which is lost. what was the cause of this the answer  is slothfulness or Neglect to appoint a man to occupy a few moments  in writing" "FIGURE Here Let me prophesy the time will come when if  you neglect to do this you will fall by the Hands of unrighteous men  were you to be brought before the authorities and accused of any crime  or misdemienor and be as innocent as the angels of God unless you can  prove that you were some whare els your Enemies will prevail against  you but if you can bring Twelve men to testify that you were in some  other place at that time you will escape there hands now if you  will be careful to keep minutes of these things as I have said it  will be one of the most important and interesting records ever seen I have now laid these things before you for your consideration and you  are left to act according to your own Judgment"- (See record of the  Twelve Historians office) ^and History of the Church February 1835^ I have thus refered to sume of the words of  Joseph to the Twelve Apostles at their organization. This shows the  feelings of the Prophet Joseph upon this subject I have had this  same subject upon my mind ever since I have been a member  of the church I have been inspired and moved upon to keep a Journal  and write the affairs of this church as far as I can I did not understand  why my feelings was exercised so much in the early age of this church  but I understand it now I seldom ever heard Brother Joseph or the  Twelve preach or teach any principle but what I felt as uneasy as  a fish out of water untill I had written it then I felt right I  could write a sermon of Josephs a week after it was delivered almost  word for word and after it was written it was taken from me or from  my mind this was a gift from God unto me and I have kept a  Journal of almost evry day of my life for the last 24 years I could  tell each day what I had done, what company I was in and what  was transpiring around me and any teachings or councils from the  presidency of the Church except whare I knew that reporters had   ENDENTRY written there discourses and I have urged this same course upon the Twelve  and all the corums of the Church to keep a record of there meetings and the  dealings of God with them and for all men who bear the Priesthood  to keep a record of their lives esspecially of all their official acts in  the church and kingdom of God. You may say that this is a great deal  of trouble vary well it has been to me in one sens it has occupied  nearly evry leasure moment of my time for 24 years but what of it  I have never spent any of my time more profitably for the benefit of  manking mankind than in my Journal writing for a great portion of the Church  History has been compiled from my Journals and some of the most glorious Gospel sermons truths and revelations that were given from God to this people  through the mouth of the Prophets Heber and the Twelve could  not be found upon the Earth on record ownly in my Journals and they are  compiled in the Church History and transmitted to the saints of God in  all future Generations does not this pay me for my trouble it does in  many instances in this Church men have been appointed clerks  to write for the church they have kept the records instead of  delivering them to the President of the Church whare they belonged and some  they would appostitize then they would insult the Church by offer- ing to sell them their own records at an enormous price. I have  deposited my records and Journals in the Historians office whare I  hope they may do some good. we have had a vary interesting time this winter during the referamation among the Latter day saints  the spirit and power of God has been poured out in a wonderful  manner and many glorious truths have been revealed through  the presidency Twelve and others and in the various quorums meeting  now should not their be a record kept of these things in the comm- encement of these meeting the clerks took quite full reports  but thinking it to much trouble they now take them vary short and  we can hardly get an outline of the real facts of our meetings  and the power of God and the dealings of God with us evry man should  write a brief history of his life his parentage, His birth his  religion when he was baptized and by whom when ordained what  to and by whome give a brief sketch of all his missions and of all his  offical acts and the dealings of God with him then if He was to  die and the Historians wished to publish his history they would  have sumthing to go by. Many may think this a dry subjet  and unimportant but it is not so to me I am now trying to  get up a history of the Twelve Apostles as first organized  half of them are now out of the Church and scarsly any record  left whareby I can get a correct knowledge of their ministry  or work and some of those who remain and are labouring to  build up the kingdom of God have not kept a record of  their missions ministry offical acts and decission upon important  subjects and the gifts graces and dealings of God with them sufficient to  give a true and corret History of their lives their are but  few aside from the presidency of this church who feel the import- ance of this subjet sufficent to put it in practice. It may be  considered by some not important to write or keep a record of our  work or the work of God but I believe it is otherwise the Prophets  would not have been moved upon to exhort us to faithfulness upon  this subject the Lord has told us that what we seal on Earth shall  be sealed in heaven and what we record on Earth shall be recorded  in heaven and what is not sealed or recorded on Earth is not sealed   ENDENTRY or recorded in heaven therefore it appears to be vary important  that we do keep a true and faithful record in all things. while walking  in a rapid stream we cannot tread twice in the same water neither  can we spend twice the same time when we pass out of that  door the work of this meeting will be closed to us forever we shall  never spend the time of this evening again then should we not keep  a record of our work teachings and council which we give in this  meeting we should. again Elders go forth upon missions to the  Nations of the Earth they have to Enter into a regular warfare the  Lord pours out his Holy Spirit upon them and they war with the world  the flesh, and the Devil, with kings, princes, Lords, Presidents and rulers  He is cast into prision the Lord delivers him. The Devil enters into  some of his converts and He lays hands upon them and he cast them out,  the saints are sick and he heals them, He prophesies in the name of  the Lord and his words come to pass. Rulers declair that He shall not  preach to the people on pain of death. He preaches the word of God and  many believe obey and rejoice in the Lord and he is protected by the  power of God. He goes upon the Sea the storms rage and he calms the water and wind in the name of the Lord. He is shielded and guarded  by angels of God all the day long and he knows the power of God is with him and reveals unto him all the evils that lie in his path  And yet he does not view thise great and important things of  value enough to make a record of them to spend a short time in writing them and the circumstances and history of those blessings  unto him are lost both to the present and all future generation. are  these things wright I do not believe they are. I do not believe a man  is Justified in neglecting to record these things.    Now as an example should the Ten lost tribes of Israel suddenly  come pouring down upon us in the Land of Zion Led by the Holy prophets  of God what would be one of the first inquiries we should make  of them it would be whare are your records and history and the  revelations and dealings of God with you since you were lead away  under Shalmanezar king of Asyria? O do let me see them and  read them and do let me read the Journal of your travels from the  North country to Our land of Zion and what would be our disappo- intment should the prophets and Elders say O we have not got any  history of the dealings of God with us nor any Journal of our  travels we used to hear our Fathers say that there hath been  great and mighty things done in the Land whare we lived the savior  come and taught great and marvellous things and we had a glorious time  in coming here we smote the rocks and the mighty mountains of Ice  fell down with a great noise and great miriacles were wrought but our Fathers had so much to do and we have had so much to do that we never  had any time to write any thing about it and we did not think that  any body would have any interest in it but ourselves and so we did  not write. would we not be awfully disappointed we should and so  with them should they ask for our records and say that Jesus and the Angels  had told th us that you was building up Zion and doing a great work  in the Earth and that great and glorious things were revealed unto you  and we now wish to read these things and should we tell them that we had  done as they had that we had not kept a record of any of these things  they would be like ourselves much disappointed, but if they and ourselves  should both keep a strict record of all that is useful then it would  add great Joy to both them and us. Then let us lay these things to heart  and keep a true and faithful record that we may be Justified befor God   ENDENTRY March 18, 1857 ~ Wednesday   18th I spent the day in the office on History I spent the evening at home    ENDENTRY March 19, 1857 ~ Thursday   19th I spent this day in the office on History I commenced the History of the  Twelve Apostles I find it difficult to get much history of some of the  first apostitize and left the Church    ENDENTRY March 20, 1857 ~ Friday   20th I spent most of the day in the Office Journal writing and on History  of the Twelve Luke Johnson was with me in the evening    ENDENTRY March 21, 1857 ~ Saturday   21st FIGURE I bought an Indian boy of Brother Willis this morning abot  6 years old.

I do not wish to say much about this case but I think many things that I do not  want to say their is many women that care more about their  wives Husband sleeping with them than they do about God or his  kingdom and if a man was to submit to such women he would  not be worth shucks in building up the kingdom of God I have got  some such woman and I visit them one a year or once in 3 years as  I please and they may go to heaven or Hell just as they please I  shall not turn away from the work of God for any woman if the  people will follow the council of the 14th ward Bishop they will be  led into the kingdom of God and so will Agness but she wants pillow  council instead of ward council well now if Agnes never hears  any more pillow council or private council take the council which  he gives to the whole ward and you will be saved men must attend  to the duties of the kingdom of God first before any other object  and Now Agnes go home and do right and Brother Hoagland go and Baptize  her if she wishes to be and so here the matter droped   I attended the council of Seventies at the 70s Hall D  Candlin and D Willkie addressed the meeting was followed by W Woodruff  and F.

But when the circumstances were told President Brigham Young sustained the Brethren who pres- ided at Provo He said they had done blank The subjects of Eunuchs came up and Joseph said that He would rath er die than to be made a Eunuch Brigham said the day would come when thousands would be made Eunuchs in order for them to be  saved in the kingdom of God. The subject of women and  Adulterry came up Joseph Asked if a woman and man who  were married could commit Adultery Brigham said that Joseph said they could not yet He was satisfied they could do wrong Presi- dent Young said we cannot KClens the Platter because the people will not bear it. Joseph I am willing to have the people Clens the  platter if they can do it in righteousness and Judge righteous Judg- ment. Brigham. This people never was half as well prepared  to execute righteousness as Now. I will tell you that when a man is trying to do right and do some thing that is not exactly in order  I feel to sustain him and we all should. I wish there was some prophet on Earth who could tell us just how much sin we must sustain before we can chastize the people and correct their errors. The wicked may  go to the states and call for troops I dont think the people will get rich   ENDENTRY to come after us they have got a long road to travel we have either got to Join hands with sin and sinners or we have got to fight them The subject of Adultery again came up Joseph said a man cannot commit Adultery with his wife so says the revelation on the Patriarchs marriage yet a man can do rong in having connexion with his his wife at times Joseph Young aske said the Ancient Apostle said this a man should not put away his wife fsave for the cause of fornication if He did they would both commit Adultery. Brigham Young said Joseph taught that when a womans affections was entirly weaned from her husband that was Adultery in spiri her  Affections were Adulterated from his He also said that there was No law in Heaven or on Earth that would compel a  woman to stay with a man either in time or Eternity this  I think is true (but I do not know) that if a man that is a High  priest takes a woman and she leaves him and goes to one of a lesser  office say the Lesser priesthood or member I think in the  resurrection that that High Priest can claim her "Joseph what if she should not want to go with him I should not want a woman under those circumstances. Brigham I will tell you what you will find that all those evil traditions and affections or passions that Haunt the mind in this life will all be done  away in the resurrection you will find then that any man who gets a glory and exaltation will be so beautiful that any woman would  be willing to have him if it was right and wharever it is right for the woman to go there she will be willing to go for all those evils will vanish to which we are subject in this life. I have told the people the truth Just as it is but others will at times get up and tell the people that they will get no heaven ^FIGURE^ ownly what they make in this life and that it will be in the next world as  it is in this now they do not mean whaat they say they do not explain themselves Hence the people will not understand what is said to them. Joseph said I wish I knew what my limits  were. Brigham Your limits are endless and you have not got half way to the end of it yet. Now hwhen I was an Elder I was as willing to correct an Error in the Brethren as I am now. But  the people do not see it so. Now if you should be with the 12  or any body you would have a right to correct an Error as  well as with a member but you could not correct them by cutting them off from the Church because they are over you in the priesthood. many other remarks were made at the time    ENDENTRY June 3, 1857 ~ Wednesday   3rd Brother Oliphant grafted some of my trees to day I spent most of the day with him I bought a yoke of 4 year old yoked of Durham Oxen deep red paid $125 for them of A Lyman  arived home this evening with the Calafornia mail    ENDENTRY June 4, 1857 ~ Thursday   4th I looked over Accounts to day with J.
