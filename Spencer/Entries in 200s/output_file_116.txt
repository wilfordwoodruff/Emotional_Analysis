 Colonia Juarez, Canton GaleavaChihuahua Mexico 14th March 1889Prest. Wilford WoodruffSalt Lake CityDear Bro.I take the liberty of writing you in regard to my son John A. Hellstrom of Richfield Sevier Co. Utah. He has just lost his wife in childbed, and has three children left without a mother's care; and no relatives whatever around him. He is, I understand selected for a mission to Europe. I desire very much to assist him in looking after and rearing his children, and could be of much help to him if he was here with me. I am getting along in years and am not able to endure all the severe labor incident to a new country, and am here alone; and my son could be a help and comfort to me here. If it is not asking too much, could his mission be changed from Europe to Mexico, and he be appointed to labor in, and help build up the settlements of the Saints in this land and thus assist him and me in helping each other? Bro. A. F. Macdonald can give you any other information you may desire. Hoping to hear from you soon and favorablyI amâ€”Your Sister in the GospelAnna B Hellstrom

Rhoner is a native of that country and a man of good education. His bishop recommends him as being worthy, and we know of no reason why he would not make a good efficient worker in the missionary field. He is able to bear his own expenses to his field of labor. If there is a field wher he can be used please let us know when the next party of elders start for that country that he may be prepared to accompany them.Your BrethrenDaniel D. McArthurA. W. Ivins

 MORMON TABERNACLE, SALT LAKE CITY,ON RIO GRANDE WESTERN R.Y.Monroe, May 31, 1893.President Wilford Woodruff,Salt Lake City, Utah.Dear Brother:With pleasure, at this my first opportunity, Ireply to yours of the 23, inst. I had not returned from school at Provo, when the news reached me that your letter awaited me here.Although I feel humble in accepting such a great call, I feel to say the Lord's will be done, and not mine. I am a single man, have not ^been^ through the Temple, nor have I the means just now with which to go, (not having sold our wool), but with the help of the Lord I shall be prepared financially and otherwise to go at the dated time (June 24).I feel thankful to be considered worthy of a mission, knowing it will be an experience for good that can be had in no other way.Your Brother in the Gospel,Hanmer Magleby.Orson Magleby Bp.Good,J F S. 
 wishes of his Father, brother Jacob Houtz, who says that if it could be changed to some field where the english language prevailed he would be highly delighted. Bro Houtz is willing to assist his son to fill a mission but earnestly pleads to have him sent to the British Isles or to the Unidted States or somewhere that he would not have to learn both the Gospel and the language. Brothe Houtz was from Pennsylvania, as was his father before him having come from the old world in the 17 cent. while the Father can talk Jeman, he has never learned a child a single word,I would knowing their feelings in the matter suggests, providing it was agreeable with the prompting of the spirit of the Lord that he be changed to either the British mission or the Southern States

 Prest Woodruff felt grateful for the privilege of seeing the delightful exhibition ^of fruit^ this evening, & stated the businessof the evening--^which was, to^ m presenting the Constitution & Laws as far as prepared--& exhorted all present to improvetheir time in planting seeds, for what is presented ^this evening^ are but seedlings -- not inoculated fruit which will comparewith seedlings, in ^Philadelphia, New York & Liverpool or^ any ^other^ country in the old settled States.  many persons have an idea it takes a long life to raise fruit,& yet here is fruit raised from stones ^planted^ three years ago--& ^he^ read a report of what he has raised on 20 feet by 50 feet.I consider this experiment proof against any argument against raising fruit in these vallies--(& then presented ^exhibited^ the severalsamples to their observation ^of the assembly.)^   some of the best specimens have ripened and are gone eaten & cannot therefore be shown.but you can be interested enough to raise a sufficiency of fruit for yourselves -- & also sustain a Horticultural society--

She is in need of immedi-ate assistance to get some articles of clothingbefore she returns home to Minersville.

 Citty of Joseph Oct 16th 1845Beloved Brother Woodruff we are in councel thismorning with the twelve in the upper room of Br Taylorshouse formaly ocepite by James Ivens, we meet and pray twiseevery day, by so doing we have benable to preserve our selvsfrom the rath of our enemes, we have had a good deal ofSorrow and trubble here this fall in concequence of sickness andthe mob, our enemes commenced burning homes in Lyma then came upto Father Morleys neabhorhood they continued burning thill they destroyed about 150 buildings and conciderable grane, then our Sherif J. B.Backenstos. Ordered out a possee of severalhundred men and marched through the countryin order to disperse the rioters or take themand bring them to justice. two or threeof them were killed and wounded, and theremainder fled to Mo, or to the adjoining couneties, in order to avoid the law. this causeda tremendous excitement around us and MobMeetings were held in Quincy and many otherplaces. threats, Inflamatory, Speaches were madeand resolutions passed to the effect that weshould leave the state or be exterminated. In the mene Time the Governor ordered out a fewhundred men, who marched into the county, andhave now been here some Time, mostly atCarthage but sometimes in this city. theyare sent to maintain the law, but they have 
 accomplished nothing as yet against the house burnersand they never will. Gen. Harder, Judge Douglass,and Majory Warren are at the head of thetroops. But they have told us plainly thatthe prejudice of the people was such thatthe State cannot pesably protect us and thatit is therefore advisable for us to removeas the only conditions of peace.We have determined to do so in the spring.Their force is now reduced to some 70 men,and there is peace.We held our General Conference in the tem-ple on the 6th inst. we meet in it now everySabbath. The font and the rooms in theateck story are nearly ready for use, andwe expect to commence the ordinances ofendowment in a few days, and to continuethem daily through the winter. We also ex-pect to finish and dedicate the temple nextspring. We shall probably sell and rent ourplaces here, and rent the public buildings,the arsanal is nearly finished, and, the NauvooHouse, can soon be ready for the Roof.Our Council to you is to send no more em-egrants here; but let them wait in Eng.till they can ship for the Pacific Ocean,say the Boy of St. Francisco, or YVancouersIsland, or such other plae or plaes as

Upon the Nauvoo House we have for the present suspended operationsAs the question was asked upon Adultery and the man being twice cut off from the Church for the same thing - I can only refer you tothe B of D.C. when A man is cut off and he begs forgiveness, the Laws of our Church make it binding to baptize him whensoever he requires it at our hand but if that a man is addicted to such things it is hard to keep then from it either in or out of the Church but I should be careful how I baptizedsuch characters into the Church it should be conditional as I would give them a day of probation but I know no other rule to be governed by it must be discretionary on your partBr  Phelps will send you power to collect money for him in that CountryBr Clayton will shortly recieve his promise and write you a long letterYour letter was read before the Council who were pleased to hear from you  Br Kimball desired to be remembered in the Bonds of Love to you and family as also all the quorum join in the same desireIn conclusion Dear Brother I pray that the Godof peace may attend you in all your endeavors to establish the Kingdom that Wisdom and intelligence may be given you that you may be privilegedto behold Zion arise and put on her beautiful garments and be crowned with honor and immortality.

 City of Joseph August 21st A. D. 1845To W. Woodruff,Dear Brother, once more I write to communicate to youour situation, and progress, and how the Lord has blessed us.We have been remarkably blessed with health this seasonand there has been very little sickness this season, and theBrethren have been enabled to labor remarkably, and theyhave raised grain enough to support twice the amountof inhabitants, besides, they have labored wonderfully onthe Temple and Nauvoo House. The Temple is up, the shinglesall on, the tower raised and nearly ready to put the domeup. The joiners are now at work finishing off the inside, and within two months we shall have some roomsprepared to commence the endowment. The joiners willbe able to finish the inside work during the winter.The committee of the Nauvoo House are driving that on briskley. They have got their brick now ready, also their [hive]sand and timber. The trustees and committee being satisfiedthat Brother L. Woodworth was not a suitable man to go ahead and do justice to such a building, therefore he wasdroped and Brother Wicks appointed architect of the house.The masons have commenced work and in two monthsthe walls will be complete, and the roof will go on this fall,and be ready for the inside work which the joiners will comm-ence soon as they finish the Temple. The [mobocrals] begin totremble, and make preparations for leaving this county. and we pray the Lord to speed their flight. The Brethrenhave gathered in almost by thousandes this season, andare still coming from all parts. Your little boy that liveswith brother Benboe is well. Their were fifty two of us[written on side of paper] 22nd.the domewill beraisedtomorrow [end of writing] 
 out the other day and took dinner. The twelve who are here and  their families.  Mother Smith and her children.All seemed to enjoy themselves well. Brother Wm Smith is herefilling his place as Patriarch. I have gotten a carriage forMother Smith which cost ^about^ $400, and now we have the pleasureof seeing her and her children ride out instead of goingall the time on foot. You will have noticed the distressthere is through this country occaisioned by fire. It seemsas tho the people could but see the Lord is pouring outhis hot displeasure by sending ^distruction^ on all parts; the Lossof property and distress is immense. A letter from BotherA. Fielding informs us that Rigdon is on at Pittsburgh washad tried its cable to the anchor of our not being able toget the roof on the Temple, which if which if we did. [Rigdonison] would fall, the roof is complete, the last thinghhaving been misled on above a week ago.We have hired the Nauvoo Mansion of Sister Emma for threeyears, and are about byuying the Masonic hall Tavern, and thenwe shall have the controle of all taverns in the City.There are but very few men left in the city thatdo not belong to the church. The New York store we have bought out and they are gone. there are only Grubb & Richeyleft on the hill, and Clapp on the flatts, that are not withus heart and heaand. And we expect they will soon have.There are eight of the twelve now in the City andwe expect Brother Parley will be here soon as Brother Orsonhas gone to take his place. Those who are here and theirfamilies are well. Brother J. E. Page is here, occupies a partof your house, is building himself a house close by yours, Brother H. C. Kimball has built himself a house this saseason, a fine large one, it is nearly finished. There are manygood buildings gone up this season. Twice or Thrice as 
 many as in any one season before. We want you to keep allthe American elderz, that are there, until we send more, whichwe think will be this fall in time for the brethren to returnhome and get their endowments by spring. But by allmeans let them tarry until their places can be suppliedby men that we shall send, after receiving their endowments.so they will not be under the necessity of returning backimmediately. aAs the Temple is so near finished we do not thinkwisdom to send over any more until they get their endowments.We shall then send about twenty this fall and moreduring the winter and spring, and you need not be surprisedif you see Brigham Heber and Willard there in the spring.So be of good courage and may the Lord bless youall Amen. I want you to push forward the publicationof the Hymn book and Doctrine & Covenants together with all other books needful. Let their copy rights be securedin my name as President of the Church, and ^not^ [the] [tear in paper]Lord Father blss and comfort you and aid you to [tear in paper]a good work in his name.Yours As Ever in the bonds of theNew and Everlasting CovenantBrigham YoungP.S. We have just heard from Kirtland. Mr. Rigdon has lately been there, he was sent for by his folloerwers sayingthat he would Baptise many but when he arrivedthere , necs no one ready for him to administer toand he returned to Pittsburgh rather disappointedThe Brethren in Kirtland are mostly calculatingto come up here this fall. Cousin Lemuel in thewest are doing well and have been visitedby a number of their friends who are seeking theirsalvation. We hear good news from the islands of the S. Pacific 
 We trust within one year many of our brethren will beplanted on the coast of t^h^e Pacific ^or near by^ ready to recieve their friendsfrom the islands. thHe who are raising movies for the establish-ment of factories for the benefit of the poor should be enstructedto hearken to the council of the Church both in regard to locationand manner of building, as they understand the nature ofthose things here better than strangers.[Sideways test]Willford WoodruffEditor of the Millenial StarShanly's buildingsBath StreeetLiverpoolEng.Via of Boston andHalifax S.

 Upper Room Es Richards House, City of Joseph, June 27th 1845Dr Brother Woodruff: We sit down to acknowledge the receipt of your letters containing some en-quiries in regard to your business &c in England, and it being just one year this day since the massacreof our beloved brethren Joseph & Hyrum we have concluded to spend the day in conversation, council and prayer, and, also to write an answer to your letters, well knowing that a little information from this place must be acceptable to you at all times, for we feel it is a source of comfort to us to hear ofyour prosperity. (The members of the quorum of the Twelve who are in Nauvoo, the Bishops, and one or two others have met regularly twice a week on Sunday and thursday evenings for some time back to offer up our prayers and thanksgivings agreeably to the order of the Holy Priesthood for the salvation and peace of the saints; and also that the Lord would over-rule all matters, so that we might be permitted to dwell in peace, untill we could finish the Temple, and the Nauvoo House,and the brethren get their endowment.  For this we have supplicated by night and by day, and hithertowe have been prospered in a manner beyond our most sanguine expectations (We have never failed in our meetings to ask God to over rule the courts which have lately been held in this county,so that the enemy might have no power to drag any of us to Carthage, or otherwise harass and perplexus with writs &c. and especially, previous to the extra session of the court which commenced on tuesday last we have felt to pray that the hand of God might rest heavily on Judge Young, the lawyers and the mobocrats, that they might have no power to do any thing against the truth but for it, and you will see by this letter that God has answered our prayers and granted the desires of our hearts.) Another subject for which we have constantly supplicated is the welfare and success of our dear brethren in England, brother Parley in New York, the brethren on the Islandsof the Pacific, (and cousin Lemuel in the west)  These with our petitions for the sick in our midst (especiallysister Jenetta Richards who has been nigh unto death for some time past (but is now recovering slowly) the prosperity of the Temple and Nauvoo House; and also that God would preserve us from internal bevils [devils], has been the theme of our prayers from time to time, and we are happy to say that God has heard and answered our prayers, and done all things well. The most perfect union, peace and good feeling has invariably prevailed in our little councils whichstill continues. It seems like a foretaste of celestial enjoymant, and millenial glory.  (The names of the brethren who have composed this council, are as follows: President B. Young, H. C. Kimball, J. Taylor, O. Pratt, W. Richards, O. Hyde, G. A. Smith, A. Lyman & J. E. Page of the Twelve. (N. K. Whitney & G. Miller, Trustees; father John Smith, Patriarch, and Josh Young, L. Richards, W. Clayton & J. C. Kingsbury.)  --  (At the May term of the Carthage court the trial of the men indicted for the murder of brother Joseph came on, which occupied nearly the whole session. It occupied three or four days to impannel a jury on account of the lawyers on the part of the defence challenging every person selected, untill they succeeded in getting a jury of their own cloth.  The Judge proved himself as much a friend to the mobocrats as if he was one with them, and ruled the court decidedly in their favor; and although the evidence produced was abundantly sufficient not only to hang those indicted, but also a number of the witnesses themselves, yet the jury brought in 
 a verdict of "not guilty," and the murderers were acquitted on this case.  The court adjourned and appointed the 24th inst. to try the murderers in the case of brother Hyrom.  Er [Elder] G. D. Watt attended court and took minutes of all the evidence and speeches on both sides, which will be published the earliest opportunity and you will then see, how much justice and virtue there is in the Judges and courts of our land.  This matter was decided as we supposed it would be, for we consider that it belongs to God and his people to avenge the blood of his servants.We did not expect the laws of the land would do it.  During the sitting of this court there were officers hear near all the time with writs and subpoena's for the brethren, but they could not find any body they wanted, and the mob were completely foiled in every attempt to bring trouble upon us.  Our prayers were answered and we gave God thanks.The court met pursuant to adjournment on tuesday last to try those indicted for the murder of brother Hyrum.  Soon after dinner a quarrel arose in the Court House between the Sheriff (Genl Deming) and Doctor Samuel Marshall, an oldmobacrat; on account of some difficulty in the land sales.  Marshall abused Deming and threatened him severely.Deming tried to get away from him and backed out towards the office door, but Marshall followed him in a threatening attitude, and attempted to seize him by the collar, till finally when they got to the door, Deming very deliberately took out of his pocket, a six barrelled revolving pistol, and let his antagonist have the contents of one barrel.  The ball struck Marshall in the abdomen.  He lived about fifteen minutes and then departed to receive his reward in hell.  Deming was cool as the summers morning.  He immediately surrendered himself, and was locked up in one of the offices of the Court House.  This circumstance produced a tremendous excitement.  The mobocrats sent their rumers through the county threatening to kill Deming before morning, and also to kill every Jack Mormon in the county but in this they were dissapointed for they could not possibly raise a mob sufficient to meet the few friends Deming had in Carthage.  An inquest was held on the body and all the jury except Daniel H. Wells gave in their verdict of wilful murder, but Wells would not consent to it.  They finally had Deming indicted before a grand jury for wilful, premeditated murder in the first degree, and the court has been occupied till the present in arguing whether Deming shallbe admitted to bail till next court, and the result is, he is admitted to bail, and no doubt on account of his being indicted for wilful  murder he will be acquitted.  The trial for the murder of brother Hyrum was dismissed for want of a prosecution, and the court has had to adjourn, without doing a single thing, only cause one of the mobocrats to be sent to his own place.  The judge has been sick all the time and acts like a person who has about lost his reason, more like a fool than a judge.  So you will perceive this storm has blown over just as we desiredand the saints enjoy peace and prosperity.  Demings course has produced a feeling of terror in the breasts of the mobocratsand they are quailed and unable to raise a breeze.  They have tried during the week to serve writs on a member of the brethren here, but have not done any thing.  We are all safe, and the court is over.  We have mentioned these particulars to show you that God is with us, and has kindly preserved us, and brought us safe through every storm.The corner cap stone of the Temple was laid by the Twelve, on Saturday morning the 24th of May at 6 o clock, in the presence of many saints.  It would have pleased you to have heard the hossannas on that occasion, and to have witnessed the short but interesting ceremony.  The frame work of the roof is all on the building and the 
 next week the brethren expect to go to putting on the shingles.  The frame work around the foundation of the Tower is all up and the first timbers for the Tower itself was raised this day.  The new stone Font is mostly cutand the first stone was laid to day at about 4 o clock.  We expect in about five or six weeks the attic story of the Temple, and the Font will be all finished and ready for dedication, and just as soon as they are ready we shall dedicate them, (and go to work giving the brethren their endowments.)  We have all the lumber for the Temple on the ground, and over 100,000 pine shingles for the roof.  The lead for the eaves and the Tin for the dome of the Toweris all bought. We have paid near $4000 this spring for Lumber, and near $1000. for lead and tin and have as yet lacked nothing.  There is the most perfect union prevailing amongst the saints, and every man seems determined to do all he can to roll on the works of the Temple as fast as possible.  E[lde]r Hyde started East about ten days ago to purchase the cloth for the Tabernacle, and E[lde]r Egan is gone to St Louis to buy about $125 of Hemp to make the cords for itThe brethren are clearing the ground around the Temple, and we expect to have the Tabernacle reared so as to be ready to meet in this fall. We are building a stone wall around the Temple block eight feet high and about five feet thick at the base.  The wall on the north side is already pretty much built. The most of the wood work for the Temple is finished; all the window frame and sash are made, and the glaziers are ready to set the glass which we expect here in a few days.  The frame and ornamental work of the Tower is all ready to put up, and the whole is far under way.The Nauvoo House committee have reorganized and the saints have appointed E[lde]rs A. Lyman & G. A. Smith on that committee in the place of L. Wight & J. Snider.a large quantity of brick are all ready made for the Nauvoo House and considerable means on hand to prosecute the works.  We calculate to have it covered in before winter.The arsenal is ready for the roof timbers, and the timber on the ground.  We have also a pretty good stock of furniture, ready to adorn the inside of the arsenal as soon as it is ready)  (We have the necessaries both of the small tribe and large, all in good order ready to talk when needed.  We have 4 good peacemakers, all right.)There are many good buildings erecting in different parts of the City.  among the rest is one for mother Smith, which the Trustees are building.  There is not much sickness in the place, and there never was a more prosperous time among the saintsin general since the work commenced.  (The course of E[lde]r Wm Smith since his return to Nauvoo has not been such as we could have wished.  He seems to think he ought to be president of the church, and since he was ordained a Patriarch to the whole church he has endeavored to get up an influence among the saints to persuade them that the office of Patriarch necessarily makes him president.  We think to the contrary, knowing better and therefore but a very few that will listen to him for a moment.  He seems determined to cause us trouble, but our prayers continually ascend up to our heavenly father to overrule William and save him if possible.  However we know that God is with his servant Brigham and will sustain him in his place, and we have no fears but the saints will do likewise, should it come to a trial.G. J. Adams has been cut off from the church for adulterous and dishonest conduct.  He embezzled money which was sent from the East for the Temple.  Since he was cut off, he has organized a church at Augusta, I. L. and appointed Jared Carter president of the stake, and Leeman Gibbs (the man that tormented brother Parley so in prison) for Patriarch.  Since that time his friends have forsook him, in answer to our prayers, and he is now selling his furniture and every thing he has to pay his debts contracted to make scenery for his theatre, and weare informed he is about to leave for the East. 
 We hear little concerning Rigdonism of late, but have an idea that they have had such hot times in and about Pittsburgh, that they have cooled off.  They make no proselytes only among apostate Mormons.Our cousin Lemuel in the west feel well towards us.  We have lately heard from them and all things look right thereYour little boy is quite well and cheerful, as also your brother in laws family.  The families of the Twelveare all well except Dr Richards lady and she is recovering. - Nauvoo or more properly the City of Joseph looks like a paradise.  all the lots and land which has hitherto been vacant & unoccupied have been enclosed this spring and planted with grain and vegetables, which makes it look more like a garden of gardens than a city and the season has been so favorable, the prospect is there will be enough raised within the limits of the corporation to supply the inhabitants with, corn, potatoes &c.  Hundreds of acres of praire land have also been enclosed and is now under good cultivation, blooming with corn, wheat, potatoes and many other necessaries of lifeA great many strangers are constantly pouring in to view the Temple and the City.  They express their astonishment and surprise to see the rapid progress of the Temple and the beauty and grandeur of Mormon works.  Many brethren are moving in from abroad who seem highly delighted with the place and all its appendages.In regard to your matter we have only to say that we approve of your printing the Doctrine and covenants in England and would also wish you to continue the publication of the star and such other works as may be considered necessary.We also think it best for the Elders to tarry in England, untill we can send Elders from here to supply their places who will not need to return for their endowmentsWe now conclude with our best wishes and prayers for your health and prosperity, with that of your family and those associated with you.  Please remember us to brothers Clark and Hedlock and their families, and all the brethren with you, and believe us to be as ever, yours in the bonds of the everlasting covenant of truth and righteousness.   Brigham YoungP.S.  Sunday June 29th This day the 28th quorum  of the seventies has been organized and is nearly full.  There are 27 quorums duly organized, and all appear united in the same interest and firmin the faith.  Brother Milton Holmes is remembered by us in his station.  He has been appointed one of the presidents of one of the quorums of seventies.We have just learned that all G. J.

 W. Woodruff ag[ai]n esteems it a privilege to ag[ai]n address his bre[thre]n bef[ore] we leave. I always felt there were wiser men than meto address the p[eo]pl[e] I am willing to stand in my place & tell what is in my heart. I leave my test[imony] bef[ore] we leave.I am thankful to see the table of the Ld spread bef[ore] us in the wild. there have been teachings from this stand that it wo[ul]d be wellfor us to give heed to. we stand in need of a man to stand as a lited candle in Israel who has the Sp[irit] of God.we wo[ul]d one & all do well to give heed to the teachings. there has been counsel given ab[ou]t various Sts. this people [h]av[e] seen the L[or]dwith them they [h]av[e] seen the L[or]d with them & are surprised to see men follow after [leaders] who rise up. every man who honorshis duty will be counselled not to follow the delusive Sp[iri]t. I [h]av[e] not always searched for the L[or]d as much as I ought to have done. I want to walk in the Sp[irit] of truth, & rise & reign with this p[eo]pl[e]. the only fear I [h]av[e] is that my Pres[iden]t will not reproveme when I need reprove. there has been a Sp[irit] in the Camp that wo[ul]d [h]av[e] sent us all to hell if we had not repented.There is still room for it the the hearts of us all. my desire is that bro Brigham wo[ul]d always chastise me when I amout of the way. I want them to hold on to me all the time. it is better to be reproved than left in darknessI thank God we [a]r[e] got so far towards the mountains & we ought to be careful that after the Quorum of the 12 [& 11] left herethat they do not follow delusive Sp[irit]. I [h]av[e] medicated a great deal upon what br Brigham s[ai]d that we sho[ul]d keep the Sp[irit] of the L[or]dI rejoice that there [a]r[e] so many here in the faith & if we combine to do well all will be right. 
 W Woodrufffelt well & was glad he was hearre on this journey. he was in the ^Zions^ Camp of 33 or ^3^4 as a general thing. the Sp[irit] of peace reigns & pervades in thisCamp, less murmuring, grumbling here than in any other journey. this is a time to do & not to preach. we r improving as we grow olderevery man sho[ul]d feel a general interest in every horse & ox. this ^preservation^ is our temporal Salvatn. I do not believe we have one mean man inthe Camp. I bel. the hand of God is in this journey & if we r faithful we shall go to the very spot where it will be the Will & Mindof God to give us ^an inheritance^ 
 W. Woodruff I shall not forget the time that bro. J. Smith stood upon a Wagn Wheel, told the camp that the die was cast, the dovemust come. there r persons here who were there when the destroyg angel visited us. we av made a covt, God, angels av witd it. I dontwant to see such a scene agn. I want u to burn every deck of cards, Chequer board &c. we av got to lay them aside. it dont bec usas apostles & Hi Priests, ma God bless us &c I am thankful that we av Watchmen on the Walls to discern things &c. 
 W. Woodruff [h]as been much edified in hearing the remarks, for the things will come to pass. I [h]av[e] observed there has been universal feelings of joy since we came into this valley. we [h]av[e] come to the very place that God wants to place us in.of all ppl under heaven we [h]av[e] as much reason to exercise patience. they [h]av[e] passed thro many trials, we [h]av[e] walked by faith & not by si[gh]t. there [h]as always been something to keep us very busy. there [h]as been something peculiar about the ppl a great zeal such as cannot be found on the face of the Earth. something [h]as been internally so that a man [h]as been stimulated to act: we were like little chil[dren] & dont no much now, same power [h]as sustained the prophet that all Earth & hell could not subdue.  Alexander wo[uld]d [h]ave been discouraged under the trials that we [h]ave [h]ad. we [h]ave been surrounded with oppressors. Satan [h]as [h]ad posse[essio]n of the Earth near 6000 yrsâ€”the poor Devil once off[ere]d the Savior all the gl[o]r[y] of the world if he wo[ul]d fall down & worship him. W[he]n the poor Devil didn't hold of a [love] of the land.we [h]ave been moved upon by the power of God, by the shed blood of the Prophets that cry to us all the time from the Earthwhen I look at our calling what manner of persons ought we to be, being sustained by the arm of God we shall conquer,even if it takes all the ri[gh]teous prophets from Abel to Joseph & Hyrum to pour out the vials upon the Earth. we can claim the blessings of the Sons & Dau[ghte]rs of Abram. it is our ri[gh]t & priv[ilege] to claim our inhertances. I often wonder why we r so slow. I feel encouraged to bel[ieve] there is going to be an increase of faith here. we ought to fear sin & take heed lest we stumble like some Apostles, Hi Priests & o[the]rs who [h]av[e] fallen. where r theyâ€”they [h]ave gone like the blind leading the blindboth fall into the ditch. the St[rength] of the L[or]d bears test[imony] to me that we shall rece[ive] judg[men]ts in this place if we r not faithful,& then we shall rece[ive] the Str[ength] of the L[or]d if we r faithful. I wo[ul]d as soon walk thro' the gates of hell, as walk thro these U. S. or Steam Boats, Canals, &c[.] I feel that the U. S. die is cast, their damnation dont sleep. they [h]ave committed the last deedthey [h]av[e] killed the prophets & cast the P. & H of God out of their midst. I wo[ul]d as soon go to hell to preach, as go &preach in the U. S. [than]. In Nauvoo ^(or any return to W.?)^ I co[ul]d [h]ave the Sp[irit] of God to preach damnation to them for I co[ul]d not preach Sal[vatio]nto them until the judg[men]ts [h]ave gone over the Earth.  I tho[ugh]t  if Jose told an anecdote about Aunt Wheeler at Farmington.ma my heavenly Father deliver me from the Christians of the 19th Century. 
 W. Woodruff. Council has been given that is good. the hand of God has been visible to us, on our mission. we [h]av[e] seen it felt it, realized it, as it was to the Chil[dren] of Israel. it has been preserved by the hand of God for this p[eo]pl[e]. Hope the bre[thre]n & sis: will listen & understand for as sure as there is a God in Israel if a man pollutes that land he will be cursed. stealing is one of the most cursedest things that cod. be among us. my prayer to God is that their bodies may die & go to dust. remember your God by da & night & you will be blest. my prayer is that men may die rather than to live & pollute our families. 
 W. Woodruff the city is bounded ^East^ by 500 miles of Eternal Sage--on the West by the 60 mile long drive without wood grass or water& on all sides by a [munnition] of rocks. I want you to remember your covenant & help to remove the ppl to the goodly land 
 but I am more of a Gabbler that bro[ther] Orson -W Woodruff with regard to bro[ther] Brigham the Quo[rum]s [have] always sustained him, it has been a general principleit is our duty to uphold him - my feelings [are] similar to the others - their characters ought to be held up bythe Prest in a similar way - bro[ther] Young has sometimes occasionally given me a little touch - but it wo[ul]d [have] a bettereffect if bro[ther] Young sho[ul]d just step up to the bro[ther] & tell him you [are] doing wrong - it wo[ul]d [have] a better affect of correctingthem hop[efully] - there has been more union in the Quo[rum] under bro[ther] Young than under any o[the]r man - first chastise himprivately - then in the Quorum - bef[ore] it goes before the public - some persons may report things to bro[ther] Brigham & thatmay cause him to have prejudice against his bro[ther] - I feel it is his privilege to chastise every man - but he ought tocome before me - before he brings me before the public - he has been in the same situation as I now am - if that courseway to be pursued I sho[ul]d be in from & sho[ul]d be expecting to hear my name next - if he comes to me - I will humble myself& try to do better - bro[ther] B[righam] may have the reasons for doing it. 
 W. Woodruff feels thankful for the mistrous [mysteries] heard this day - it is right that all erroneous principles sho[ul]d be corrected.Mormonism comprehends all truth & is an Eternal principle which is not yet forgotten by the world, neither will it be.The World is full of error & that is a popular doctrine - but when men advocate the prin[ciple] of eternal truth, it oftentimescosts the best lives - it has cost the best blood of this generation & it has cost us our rights, our liberties, our properties our all -it does me good to read the lives of Abel Noah, Melchisedek, the Hebrew Children - & in modern times of Joseph & his followerstho they are driven from State to State - it wo[ul]d require but little faith to walk with the Gentiles & partake of her Sins -& the same Sp[irit] that moved the ancient Saints is serving the El[ders] of Is[rael] these days - all is passing along just right -we [have] enough every da[y] to inspire the heart of man - when we look at the blessings of the res[erectio]n - & let the world takewhat course it will, it mattereth not - so that I may take part in the 1st res[erectio]n - we [are] just the only [people] who [are] readyto keep the same law & magnify their calling - we [have] enough to encourage us to keep faithful - 
 W. Woodruff has been idified at the remarks I [have] heard this morn[ing]. I have been meditating ab[ou]t the priv[ilege]; & blessings that we enjoy& the priv[ilege] of preaching, in being absent from the Council & then to assemble in Conference - if the El[ders] of Is[rael] magnify their calling Is[rael] -does not need much of the Sp[irit] to prophecy that they will prize the priv[ilege] of hearing the Co[unse]l of the Twelve - & by & by you wo[ul]dgive every coal you [have] so that you co[ul]d only stand an hour in the Councils of the 12 - while we [are] abroad in the Vineyardthere is the ?5 we stand in need of all the teachings that we can get & I sa[y] treasure up knowledge & instru[ction] & I promise you inthe name of the L[or]d that you wo[ul]d be glad to get our Councils - look at bro Pratt - he has been absent 6 y[ea]rs & he wo[ul]d give all theGold he ever saw to [have] the priv[ilege] of standing an hour in these meetings - I testify to you that the ?6 of the L[or]d [h]as been visible to usall this Summer & when I [kn]ow the L[or]d is leading this [people] today I am satisfied - altho we [have] not [h]ad a deal of ?7we [have] [h]ad plenty of Buff - I want to [have] the ?8 to learn wisdom imprint it on our hearts & minds - there is a good dealof meaning in what bro Brigham has s[ai]d - you ma[y] go into some crises & wo[ul]d as soon go into hell & go into others & there you willfind peace - & you will feel the Sp[irit] & profit by it - some of the El[ders] may be required to go & preach, go to the mountains, or stayalways be actually willing to want to do the Will of God & if we take this course we shall be sure to come out right - whohas born off the work of the L[or]d there has not been one out often that has been out to preach - we ought to be wise -oftentimes we lose sight of the responsibility that is resting upon us in carrying out the views & intentions that [are] laid upon us -you [are] the men that those ancient Prophets [have] seen & who [have] to carry off the work - there is a good deal to be donewe [have] but just began - the L[or]d has blest us since we commenced - the nations of the Earth has got to be warned & you [are] themen who [have] got to go & do the work - when the 12 lay down their heads you will [kn]ow to bear off the K[ingdom] - & you ought to ?11up your ?12 all the day long & your mind will expand all the day long - very few men co[ul]d be called to go thru the trials ifthey were seen when the men first look up this work, but there is a Sp[irit] that [h]as sustained the [people] all the day long - when weconsider the glory that will be given unto the [people] for their faithfulness it will repay all the trials & troubles - when you see menwilling to go forw[ar]d trusting in the L[or]d, you will see men who [are] blessed all the day long - a man who has got the Sp[irit] of the L[or]d. you cantdrive him away from the work & it is far better for us to walk in righteousness & do our duty than to swerve from the Lord -we [have] [h]ad to go out as Abraham did not knowing whither we went - & now we go into the habitations of men & see them surroundedby the good things - that valley is a right kind of place where we can worship the L[or]d & it is a good thing that we can go into the cliffs ofthe rock & be hidden up - this will prove a greater blessing to us as a [people] - & let us hearken to council build up the K[ingdom] of God& build ourselves up - & let us obey council & by traversing that course we shall rejoice in it - if we walk out of that channelwe [have] darkness & gloom & tribulation - may the L[or]d bless & guide & direct you that we may walk by his Council while we dwell on the Earth.?5prizetime?6spiritface?7tread?8bre[thren]cour[age]?11privilegeprovepower?12bre[thren] 
 W. Woodruff â€“ I view it to be of great importance to us as a [people] â€“ in regard to all ma[t]ters of this kind - if they come withoutreasons [are] given they come in a different view to what they [have] after the reasons [are] given â€“ my feelings [are] now whatever the willof God is that is my will let in come in what shape it may â€“ in the 1st place a query came will this Quo[rum] be filled up -if [brethren] [are] taken out to form a 1st pres[idenc]y it seemed like severing a body in two - there were no reasons given me & I desired this. Andsho[ul]d continue as it was - I felt if the Quo[rum] of 12 were to surrender their power unto 3 I sho[ul]d be totally apposed to it -tho there [are] some things [are] brought up ag[ain]st it - my feelings [are] on Pres[iden]t who stands at our head as s[ain]ts he was moved upon bythe Sp[irit] to speak to us â€“ our Pres[iden]t seems to be moved upon by the Sp[irit] â€“ he stands bet[ween] us & God & I for one dont want to tiehis hands. I dont care what the [Church] wants - his will is my will - I am perfectly willing [if] that sho[ul]d be the case -willing to [leave] remaining as is - 3 men holding the keys can ordain any man in the Ch[urch] - Bro[ther] Y[oung]  go conv[er]t & anoint whomthey please - if the 2 first Pres[idenc]y hold their station among the Quo[rum] of the 12 I am agreed - I dont want to stand in their way& tie up in his hands he is nearer God than I am & I wo[ul]d ra[the]r untie his hands - if theS3 first Pres[idenc]y were sep[arated] from usI [have] [h]ad some feelings preh[ap]s they may be a selfish feeling - As the Pres[idenc]y seem to be movd on by the Sp[irit] I am reconciled to it -I b[elieve] I [h]ad the disposit[io]n to hedge up his wa[y] I w[oul]d not do it - But I sa[y] God speed [to] him. 
 W. Woodruff feels thankful to converse about the things of the King[dom] - & grow more interesting every day - has many things in his mind dayly - the yearthat is past & gone I consider is the most important since the K[ingdom] of God has been on Earth - some [have] ret[urne]d from years soldiring - & some from mountains -who [have] suffered in the service of the U. S.  the spirit of the Lord has been with us this Summer, his peace has been brooding over our heads - & thoseof the ?1 [have] been preserved - many who [have] gone into the Mexican War [have] suff[ere]d immensely - & we now rejoice in their preservation of ourbrethren - God is with his [people] today - his mercies [are] arr[ound] us today - & it is a satisfaction - & ought to cheer the Saints da[y] by da[y]  they [are] blessings &a consideration to this [people]. there is more power with God da[y] by da[y] - this [people] will shortly see a fire in Zion & hypocrites will tremble - I rejoice in this thing - in going my journey to the mountains this year [h]as been a good school to me - as we cannot be in 2 places at onceI want to be where the Lord wants me to be. I never saw so mu[ch] of the power of truth visible in the Councils of Israel & the day is at handwhen the L[ord will [have] a pure [people] to gather tog[ethe]r to worship his name - & if you will be righteous you will see the da[y], that you can see theLand & the Spirits of just men made perfect - I feel that there is a Sp[irit] taking advance of what we [have] been - I hope the S[ain]ts will be faithful& let no man take their crown - we [have] been favored with living in this da[y] on the Earth & we [have] to prove ourselves - there [are] no bless[in]gs thatever were but what we shall [have]. If we get a Cel[estial] K[ingdom] we ought to be passive in the hands of the L[ord - we ought to be always on hand to do whatthe Lord wants us to do - the L[or]d is opening a door for our Sal[vatio]n & glory & I do pray that no Sp[irit] may gather with this [people] unless they dointend to keep the law - there is a reality in the bless[in]g of the L[or]d - I rejoice that I [have] formd such Society on the Earth - the El[ders] of Israel willbe more & more called on to preach to the [people] - we [have] got to war with the elements & the powers of darkness & all Eternity is in pain -we [have] tasted the Gospel & [know] of its Sweet[nes]s - I know there [are] 10s of 1000s ready to rec[eiv]e the Gospel - we sho[ul]d] be always willing to [have] ourfeelings useful in the service of the L[or]d - we ought to live to keep the commandments of God, that then we may receive the blessings that [are] in storefor us. Amen.?1BrethrenBattleEarth 
 W. Woodruff  I felt as tho I was in the midst of Mormonism - when we assembled bef[ore] - we [h]ad ?1 room - some of the lambs co[ul]d not find roomin the fold - but now we [have] a liberal room & I am glad to see them - nobody else in the world co[ul]d [have] und[erstoo]d of such thing as Mormons - to organizeour meeting until we co[ul]d build a house large enough - Pres[iden]t Young told us that one object is to see zion - and to examine your Sp[irit] whe[neve]r you were living in the faith, & to understand our own Sp[irit]. that we ma[y] stand the scrutiny of all - it stands us all to seeour selves whe[neve]r we are in the light - an[othe]r object is to la[y] business bef[ore] the Conf[erence]. the h[ou]rs of our present crices - emigration nextThing - mailing locations - &c & need [kn]ow no fears if our mind are always prep[ared]? for bus[iness] of any thing coming that wo[ul]d [cross] ourpath - we [are] like the chil[dren] of Is[rael] in the wilderness - We [have] a place Sought out where we mean to build a City - let us be preparedto go to the mountains - o[the]rs to stay here & farm & e[lde]rs go a preaching - if our wills are submissive to the L[or]d be on hand - whether to go -or stay - or go a preaching - if we get so strait as to lean a little one way we ma[y] a[llo]w things to [cross] our path - we ought to belumber[ing] all the da[y] long that the L[or]d ma[y] make vessels of honor of us - the L[or]d has led this [people] all the time - every thing looksprosperous & comfortable - the L[or]d [h]as governed all things - & blest us in the family in the garden & his [spirit] [h]as been over you - all willbe ri[gh]t with us if - we will do right - the Council that will be given [yo]u will we good - the L[or]d intends to lead his [people] in a wa[y] that they ma[y] be blest - the L[or]d has s[ai]d it is his: to a w[orl]d to the wants of his S[ain]ts - we [have] [h]ad an interest[ing] mission this S[ea]son - I see allthe time the [spirit] & bless[in]gs of the L[or]d all the time - whatever bus[iness] ma[y] he laid bef[ore] you, be ready to act on it - we [are] come to seeyour faces & talk & comfort you - & if wrong set you right - & if ri[gh]t you cant be set right - there is matter enough & businessenough to la[y] bef[ore] you - I feel thankful to meet with you & pra[y] that you ma[y] [have] the Sp[irit] of the L[or]d all the time - that youma[y] carry out the Council given you - & ma[y] the L[or]d bless you for Christ's sake  Amen?1samesome 
 W.

I realize that these refreshing times will be far[ther] between than they[have] been - we [have] to spend many years in the ?3 bef[ore] we can return - you may present events & say it aloudto the nations of the Earth they look upon it as foolish - the ante diluvian were interested in the preaching ofone man, yet only 8 souls bel[ieve]d. they prep[are]d an ark - & were saved - what can be the feelings of the Messiah bef[ore]the fall of the Jews - we feel it & see it & comprehend it in some degree - it opens a field for reflection - the joywo[ul]d be very great, but we cant comprehend it - we [have] got a long time to spead - this Ch[urch] has been wandering 18y[ea]rs driven from our houses & lands - it seems long - admitt[in]g it sho[ul]d be 100 y[ea]rs bef[ore] the Sav[io]r comes - it wo[ul]d be asquick as the raising from the d[ea]d - & I sometimes marvel the L[or]d [h]as suff[ere]d us to so short a time to prepare for so longeternity - we [have] got to live as long as our Fa[the]r - having but to spend a da[y] at [a] time we shall get there with it - itstands us to be faithful & to be ?4 to our Heavenly Fa[the]r so long as we live here - it is too late in the da[y] to try toback out in the things that we [are] engaged in - the moment we stop serving God who [h]as done every things in his powerwe [are] undutiful chil[dren] - & we injure ourselves - where the Jews any better to sustain the trials than Christ was - but whenJerusalem fell they went down to destru[ctio]n with[ou]t a ra[y] of hope to sustain them - we [have] a hope which the world[have] not - altho we [have] to wander on the prairies & in the wilderness & eat Corn Dodger we shall [have] the victory whilejudgments [are] over the Land - where is the consolati[on]s to those who [have] driven them out - when pestilence & famine put on for their?1?2wewhenwhere?3?4onl'yed

 We [have] nothing to gain be denying our L[or]d - & if the world ever gets a glory they [have] to confess that Jesus is theChrist & always be behind - the eyes dont gain any thing in the eyes of the L[or]d Our God - men women & children[have] the Devils, he has none at all - & the Devil will laf [laugh] at him - I wo[ul]d be more honorable to stand whenthe Devil will reproach the Almighty, for the Saints doing evil - Job was honorable in the eyes of God Angels& the Devil - we [have] got to become friends with God in this world & in same L[ord] - for the L[or]d will prove you unto deaththe ancient apostles [are] going to judge the 12 tribes of Is[rael] - we la[y] down our bodies in order to come out as a revived& beautiful [Edit.new] - the more knowledge a p[er]son [h]as the more he will be tried by Satan - the S[ain]t who doeshis duty is above the power of Satan - it becomes us as Saints of God to do right in all things that we donot bring a disgrace on our Heavenly Fa[the]r - all Heaven will weep over us & our Fa[the]r wo[ul]d not own us - said a few words to those who enlisted into the service of the U.

 Merthyr Oct. 20th 1848My Dear Bro. Woodruff,I, at length find an opportunity to acknowledgethe receipt of yr welcome letters, the last of whicharrived here last week & truly thankfull am Ifor your kindness in writing me & that one so unworthy is thought of, & prayed for so far away& by those whose esteem & confidence I valueabove wishes that perish. In reading over yourprecious heralds my heart leaps for joyin anticipation of the blessed day when ourwarfare will be ended among the Babilonians& when we and all the faithfull Saints will"meet to part no more" as Sectarians say on"Zion's thrice  sanctified hill." My whole soulis invigorated by your cheering counsels to goahead & in the name of him who has broughtme hitherto I sayâ€”I will go ahead &make the grampian hills of Wales echomy testimony through the glens & clearmy escuthion in the day of visitation.It is true that the Lord has blessed my laborsbeyond my anticipations so that thousandsalready of the Ancient Britons sing the songs ^of Zion^[sideways text] Capt Dan Jones Oct 20 1848 [end of sideways text] 
 in their native language & among thegraves of their Fathers & do rejoice greatlyin the prospects which has opened upontheir astonished vision promising themglittering crowns that fade not away& endless life to wear them: but, the secretof the success I find to be that I ambacked, & sustained by the prayers of suchmen as Bro Woodruff & his Quorum intheir councills,â€”on the tops of the "everlasting hills" & in their closets. With such in -centives to action who would not go ahead?Then need I creave a cintuation continuationof such support?  The interest of the cause& your love of souls will secure it.Every item of news from you especially fromour central home is sweet to me while herein exile from those I love & seek their counsellBut I find it would exaust all my sheetts & moreto tell my feelings & attachments to you & to DearSister Woodruff & to reflect on past scenes spentin sweet harmony I must change the sceneor my letter will be void of news,â€”well,â€”in regardto the affairs of the Church generally I am 
 glad that I can answer in a word that thoughout Wales it is good, yea very good indeedI had like to say that perfect union prevailsthroughout the Principality, & among the Saints"The reign of peace" has already comenced. As toour numbers at last Conference you'l doubtless readthem in the "Star." However we are increasingat the ratio of about 150 per month as nearas I can learn. I have raised here in the Mertheythe Mother Branch of Britain to over 800 members!  A pretty good beginning is it not, especiallyfor a Sailor? I have published 48 differentkinds & size of Pamphlets comprising more originalmatter, (all Welsh) than the Book of Mormon,Doctrine & Covenants & Voice of Warning combined, &have circulated about One million, near eighthundred thousand pages, all of which preachof course, night & day, to rich upon the eternaltruths of Mormonism & cheer the honest hearted.Many learned & some very noted men have of lateembraced this work & many very rich & influentialare at the door.  I have been at length enabledto subdue all my public foes here so that theyhide their heads with only an occasional squibthrough the very holy periodicals. The power of God ismade more manifest among the Saints as they increase 
 in faith & works. The gifts of the spirit areenjoyed in great profusion in almost every branchespecially "the gift of healing" many instances I mightmention which wd. make you rejoiceâ€”but I mustforbear, broken bones have ^been^ repeatedly healed in-stanteneaus, & all kind of diseases nearly, cured byfaith & the ordinances, but the ones that hadattracted the most publick notice ^of late^ is the fact thata young man who had been deaf & dumb since1840 received his speach & hearing perfectly whencoming up out of the water of Babtism. He is ordanto the Priesthood & preaches with success since. Thisthey cannot deny tho they sectarians strive hardto attribute it to some other cause, but the Saintsgive God the praise & glory. I have lately beenon a tour through many parts of England &can truly say that the condition of the Churchis bettering continually & more power manifested.My lungs for the last year have been wearingout rapidly causing me great pain from whichI wd. never be free hardly only when under theElders hands, but thank the Lord all the Saintswith one effort have held me up & now I feel somebetter than I have been.  I have seen Pres. Pratt &family in Liverpool & had much pleasure with themHe is & will be an invaluable blessing to the British Isles, a Godsend in times of need, May the God of Joseph bless him always.You have doubtless heard with regret of our beloved Bro. Spencers illness,but he is sustained by faith & prayers of all in Wales & England too.I am preparing a company of 300 or 400 Saints to start homeward inFeb. Please write me again soon. ^My wife joins me in kind love to sister Woodruff^ & yr Dearself.  Yr Bro. D Jones

 Huntington, Aug 15 [18]90Dear BrothersToday I expressed anorignal cast of an ox which I offer to youfor your acceptence or refusial as you seefit. The work is a long way from whatI desire but owing to the extreem smallness& poor clay. I was forced to submit as itis. knowing you will pass critisism onit in the spirit it is sent and beingonly a sketch will view it as such.Should you accept my proposition to modelthe Oxen for the Salt Lake Temple,I will endevor to make it as perfectas I possible can, and ask the adviceof the best artist in Salt Lake CityAll the recompence I ask is my dailyexpences while working at it as it willneed to be done, in Salt Lake CityI will need a model Steer to work from,also a room, large enough to takea Steer in. Maybe there is a place on the 
 Church farms, should you wish12 models made (which would not be as hardas it seems to be at first as as the principlesparts would done with the first model,and would only need a little arrangingsI would prefer to do it, but that wouldbe an after concideration. but I thinkI could complete the entire arrangmentin aboust 6 or 8 month.I have often desired to do something of the kindfor the aHouse of God, and would conciderit a great favor were it possible forme to present the House with the entirework, but at present circumstancesprevents me. I have wrote toPresident Cannon concerning the workand spoke to Apostle. A. H. Cannon andHe will be able to speak more fullythen I can write. 
 I am sorry the model or Sketchis so poor, but owing as I said to poorclay, detail was nearly out of the questionand what I did get a poor cast withbad, Plaster of Paris, destroied, but I hopethere is sufficient to enable you to understandmy motive and ability.I shall model & cast (if you wish) myidea of the font,  and forward, as soon aspossibleEver praying the blessing of God to rest &abid with you is the prayer ofBother in the Gosple,G.

 Mormon Battalion U. S. ArmySante fe Oct. 17, 1846.Dear Brother & Sister WoodruffI was almost afraid I wouldnot get a chance to reply to the kind lettersof the 23 August and 3 Sept. from your own andSister Woodruff's hands, but have from the extremebustle with which I am surrounded and an excessof business, snatched a few moments. Your letterscontained two sorts of news, one sort of a dismel notinsand the other inexpresibly gratifying. The newsof the continued oppression of the Saints met that receptionin my bosom, which you might expect such news wouldmeet in the breast of a faithful son of the Shamrock isle,It met with a sad reception and created in me a feelingof [bert] and unquenchable revenge. And proud am Ito think that I am now in a Situation whereI shall work about this end and prepare myselfin connexion with others more efficiently to ac-complish it. In the mean time let the growingfire of a guilty conscience add woe to their misirieswho have committed these acts that the hell of whichthey must eternally partake may begin and increasewith them till they have paid the last farthingof their debt with a just interest. I was sorryto hear of your sickness but hope you haveere this become well and strong, also hope 
 your interesting family is well its branches arein good trim and comfortable winter quarters.The best news your letter contained was thatconcerning her who has the first best claims on myaffections, love is well. That is good: So when Ismell sea air again I may have bright hopesof before long seeing the swelling sail that wafts herto the place she longs to see. By love that willbe a Jubilee of Jubillees to me. You sur I amno way bashful on the subject. You know allthe affair.Brother Stratton is doing well. Goodagain for my Brother Albert. If you see him beforeI do, tell him all that's good about me. That letterBrother Woodruff's letter mentions who under the blues canit be from. I would give a shilling to know and five to have it. It is probably from my poor old father.Well, I'll find out sometime between this and Tib's eve orbetween that and the end of everlasting. I havesent ^you^ in a check with Brother Lee Twenty one dollars& 40 cents. They ave us a month and a halfs wagesTwo dollars & 00 cents money. The rest in cheque. I hadcalculated to send you ^considerably^ more than this, expecting theywould have paid me three months wages, 48 dollars.Now I have sent you all they paid me except the $2.00 cashclothing is allwfully dear here and poor stuff at that.Brother Lee will give you a full account orf ourfuture destiny under Ltcolo. Cooke, and of whathas transpired up to this time. I have thus farwith much inconvenience kept my journal up 
 and shall continue to do so as long as I possibly canbut really the many nicnacs in Military affairs, andthe acuteness with which every thing has got tobe done, make it very hard on me. I have stillkept moving about and able to attend my businessThere was an order read for the battalion yesterdayfrom Ltcoll. Cooke appointing me Sergeant Major.This might have done well enough only for the unshippingof Brother Glines a feature I did not at all admireas he and I were on the best of terms, however, inthe army orders must be obeyed.I have hada personal introduction to our future commanderLtcoll. Cooke. His appearance though stern is [page torn]possessing. He has a noble head, and if he ha[page torn]not too much of an aristocrate about him willmake a good commander I think. I understandhe is pretty strict and there is no sherking from hisorders. Mervin is going to Perbilo. I laid your messagebefore Bevan, and since then he has not given me any in-formation on the subject. I must come to a close. Ihave a thousand things to do. This report goes that we startto morrow. Accept my kind regards. Communicate the sameto Wilfred, Phebe, Susan & Joseph, Brother Fowler Father & Mother WoodruffBrother Sister Sheets Sisters Jackson, Cossitt, Brown, King & BartonBrother George Cannon, Sister Taylor Family and all who carefor my being.In the mean time.

Will you be goodenough to answer the letter, and send some one thereas it is in your jurisdiction, and I hope that there willbe a great work done in that quarter. The Work isrolling forth mightily in this country, and many hund-reds are being added every quarter as you will see bythe Stars. I have just published a work on "DivineAuthority," or ^the question^ "Was Joseph Smith sent of God?" The tract is16 pages ^each page being somewhat^ larger than the Star, and we are gettting 20 Thousandas a first Edition, and there is likely to be a demand fora second.

 15 Wilton Street, Liverpool.Oct. 7th, 1848.Dear brother Woodruff:I received your letter orthe one you sent to brother spencer, and ha was happyto learn that you had arrived in the field of yourlabor; but was sorry to learn that you had lostyour youngest. We had quite a prosperous journey toLiverpool. We tarried one week with our friends in Wiscon-sin, and then came direct to nNew York. We sailed fromN. Y. on the 6th of July, landed in Liverpool on the26th of July. A few days after my arrival bro. Spencerwas taken very sick, he has continued sick until thepresent. He has not been able to write any for theStar since I came. Indeed it has been nothing butthe power of God through the prayers of the saintsthat he has been kept alive. He is now somebetter and some hopses of his recovery. He is ableto ride out a short distance every day. He hasbeen in the country about 3 miles from Liverpool forabout 3 weeks. The latest news from the valleyis June 9th. All is well, spring crops good, plenty ofrain. Health good. The sea gulls swept off the crickets.P. Rockwell returned from the pacific with Capt Davis.All the news is very cheering. I have issued 4 Nos. of theStar, since my arrival and now have thee proof sheet of the 
 fifth. I have also written & published 20,000 of apamphlet entitled "Divine Authority" or the "Questionwas Joseph Smith Sent of God?" This pamphletcontains 16 pages a trifle larger than the Star.Price 10 shillings per hundred, or Â£4-10-0 perThousand. I shall soon issue another pamphletprobably the same size entitled the "Kingdomof God."  I have just concluded a bargainfor the publication of 4000 hymn books &shall soon strike up a bargain for anotheredition of the Book of Mormon The newsystem of philosophy is not yet printed althoughCol. Kane has subscribed $10.00 its p towardshastening the same. The Lord bless his liberalsoul. I have sent 2 ships loaded withsaints for N. Orleansâ€”near 600 soulsincluding infants. I have just obtained a"Passage brokers license," which will here-after enable me to do business lawfullywithout depending on others. I will now mentionthe American brethren who have arrived. Dr.Peter Clinton, Milo Andrews, Eli B. Kelsey,Harrison Burgess, Joseph Clements, Wm MossBro. Clarke, Bro. Spires, Lewis Robins, AlfredCordon, William Cutler, ^&^ James H. Flanigan 
 Bro. L. O. Littlefield sailed for N. Yorkbefore I arrived had 50 days passage to N. Y. he has justreturned to Liverpool with Bro. Cutler. But I shallsend him directly to council Bluffs. His conducthas been such that he can be of no use abroad.Bro. Milo Andrews came across the ocean withme. He came into N. Y. after I had gone on boardthe ship with my family. He requested the priviledgeof taking with him his wife. He saysid Bro. Kimballadvised him to leave his far wife with her friendsin York state, when arriving with her in yorkstate he found her friends had removed toWisconsin and not knowing where to leaveher he concluded to bring her to N. Y.I told him that I would not counsel himany way either to take his wife or leave herthat he must act entirely upon his own respon-sibility with regard to her. He saysid that bro.Kimball told him to act according to circumstances & he therefore concluded to bringher. I have lately learned that it was contraryto Prest Young's mind for him to take her toEngland. I have therefore counseled him tosend her to the Bluffs which he will do assoon as she is able; she has just been confinedwith a boy. Bro. Andrews is now doing good, andI hope he may continues. The work is rollingmightily in this country. Robins, Cordon, Cutler & 
 Flanigan are ^Now^ in Liverpool they will leave ina day or two for their respective fields of laborThey send their respects to you.
