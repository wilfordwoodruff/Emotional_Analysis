He was followed by  H. C. Kimball &amp; D. H. Wells who spoke in an Edifying manner all  will be printed in the Deseret News. I attended the prayer Circle  in the evening when I arived there I saw a large company of men  &amp; women coming out of the Presidents office. He had been sealing men  &amp; women from the close of the meeting up to that time &amp; had to turn away  many which he could not attend to     spoke also Brother Hill.

Woodruff. Elder Snows  mind run in a vary interesting channel the spiritual atmosphere seemed  to be heavy when he ^a^rose but the spirit of God came upon him &amp; he  spoke in a vary edefying &amp; interesting manner the following remarks wer Elder snow was written from memery    with nearly all of this people that there is sumthing of great importance  awateing this people some think that we will be beset by a great mob  from the states others that we would have an insurrection in our midst  &amp; others sumthing Els now of if the people really knew that we would be met  by a mob &amp; that our lives depended upon our being well armed you would see this people sell their coat or shirt to buy revolvers &amp; weapons so  as to defend their wives children &amp; their own lives but I am satisfyed  that there are scenes awaiting this people that will require all the grace &amp;  wisdom which we can muster to pass through in safety. now for instance  this people are makeing a great rush to President Youngs office to get wives  sealed to them on sunday night President Young sealed men &amp; women  till it was time for the prayer circle to meet then He had to turn a room full out of Doors to wait another time this spirit is increasing throughout  this Territory now do those who are taking so many wives realize that  it will want a great Deal more power with God the Holy Ghost &amp; wisdom to preside over that Houshold than it does to go to the nations &amp; preach the gospel, build up Churches &amp; organize them &amp; preside over &amp; controll  them, if they do not realize it it is true, now here is this great body  of seventies &amp; every other Quorum of this church should labour hard  to arm yourselves with all the power of God you can get in order to save  your families if you do not if you do not you will soon find a  stampede with your wives you cannot hold them they will break  from you you  your families for if you do not have great wisdom you will  meet with trouble. you have many wives &amp; children this woman   ENDENTRY  clothing &amp; one thinks she Has to do more than her part &amp; this one will  not do what she should &amp;c &amp; the man has got to stand in the midst  of his family like a God in order to calm the troubled waters &amp; safe  them. A man may Go to a ward meeting &amp; preach &amp; the power of God  is upon him he comes home he finds one woman scolding &amp; freting  another one in tear fighting &amp; by the time he gets well in the midst of it hith faith  courage &amp; patience almost fails him, &amp; he has to rise up in the majesty  of a God as it were &amp; have Great wisdom faith &amp; patience &amp; exercise  much Generalship &amp; show himself a master spirit &amp; a savior &amp; a  Fatherly care &amp; kind ness in order to save his wives &amp; children. Here  is a mission for you ye Elders of Israel. Look for instance at the example  of president Young go into his house &amp; take lessons see him with his  great family of wives &amp; children &amp; se the God like character &amp; exam- ple of that man &amp; the order which he manifests in his family I  tell you if it was not so you would see a stampede suddenly in that  House but He is a great master spirit &amp; manifests great wisdom  in the perfect order of Government with his numerous family of  wives &amp; children, they all respect him &amp; obey his law for the wisdom  of God is with him. Now brethren strive to bring yourselves to the same  standard become a patriarch over your own Household &amp; seek to  save them connected with order you have to become a financere  &amp; you have to support your wives &amp; children &amp; you want to live  so that you can call upon God to increase your flock heards &amp;  crops this brethren is the greater work which you have to prepare  your minds for almost any fool can go &amp; preach the gospel but  it requires a vary wise man to be a patriarch &amp; save his own  household. Many other interesting remarks were made which I  have not room here to record    of Elder Snow his words are true as the gospel &amp; I bear testimony of its truth  I am watching the spirits of men we come &amp; meet with the seventies and  with all other Quorums of the church from the 12 down &amp; watch the spirits &amp;  give instruction as the spirit dictates this is not ownly our right  Here is before me a vast body of  must be fed your presidents should be filled with the spirit &amp; power of God  so that they can attend all the meetings &amp; feed them &amp; give unto them the  mind &amp; will of God if they do not do this they will die &amp; cannot stand  for the minds of these seventies must be fed but many of them who  have been ordained into these Quorms have not prized the prieshhood  which they have had sealed upon them many times they have been so  anxious to go &amp; attend to some trifling thing that they could not stop  long enough to be ordained at least as soon as the hands were off  they would run &amp; not stop to give their genealogy many of the Elders  of this Church have trifled with the priesthood. there is now a  call made to gather up all the Elders priests Teachers &amp; Deacons that are  ^not^ esspecially ingaged as teachers with the Bishops to come forward &amp; be  ordained into the seventies now it does appear to me that the Lesser  priesthood is necessary in the church otherwise the Lord would not have  esstablished it. the Headd cannot say to the feet we have no need of you  no more than the feet can say to the head we have no need of you. almost  all the Lesser priesthood are striveing to become ordained into the seventies  while the bishops wish them to officiate in the Lesser priesthood. * see the star on the other page   ENDENTRY February 3, 1857    attended the Bishops meeting in the evening at the seventies Hall we had a  good meeting Bishop Lorenzo Snow who preached  nearly the same sermon that he did last night to the 70 followed him &amp; bore testimony to the truth of what he had said I  was followed by Bishops Little    ENDENTRY February 4, 1857    I wrote 6 Letters to the Mormon, Standard, Star, J M.

He said a Bishop &amp; his councillors might cut  off a man from the church whether any of the ward voted or not  He said should the people follow a Bishop yes if he is a righteous  man &amp; does right but if he teaches wrong things &amp; does wrong the  people should not follow Him but when this is the case let the people  thunder out the truth as it is then the bishop will see it but unless the people can point out some better way let them follow the bishop. see Boltons report    take all of the Lesser priesthood which we have &amp; ordain them seventies  so by the time we get some teachers organized they are ordained to  the office of seventies. The seventies also complain that the Bishops  come &amp; take away their presiding officers &amp; the seventies &amp; make  bishops &amp; councellors of them &amp; ordain them High priest so their  appears to be a difference of feeling in the several Quorums in  order to avoid this I would recommend that the Teachers Priest &amp;  Deacons all that the Bishops wish to make use of as teachers in the several Quorum remain as they are untill they have magnifyed their  calling &amp; not evry man as soon as he is ordained a teacher go &amp; get  ordained a seventy &amp; hide himself in that mighty forest of men  so that He cannot be found For the seventies are like a forest  trees of all kinds from the tallest down to the shrubery &amp; men  get lost in such a forest men should not despise the lesser priest- hood for it is honorable &amp; if they fully magnify that office they  will have great power &amp; many blessings for the Aaronic priesthood  hold the keys of administering of Angels &amp; their has been but few men even High Priest or Apostles that have enjoyed all the blessings  that belongs to the Lesser priesthood. Then Let not the seventies seek  to get all the Lesser priesthoods ordained into ther quorums if they  do I do not wish them to complain if seventies are taken out  to Make Bishops councillors &amp; teachers of them as long as nearly  all the timber is in that body.

Bishop Hunter thinks that they should Be ordained Bishops &amp; High Priest. what shall I do about it. President Young said if  they would go their ^way^ &amp; hold there tongue about it they might stand as they  are &amp; act as Councellors to a Bishop, but if they will not, ordain them I said I thought that men ought to walk in the channel pointed out for them &amp; not complain about it President Young said yes let them do as they are told. I spent the day in the office reading History &amp; councelling Elder L Snow &amp; F. D. Richards was with me a part of the day. I attended the  Bishops meetings in the eveing. Bishop Hunter spoke &amp; I followed him I told the Bishops to impress upon the minds of the people the necessity of living their Religion after this date for if the people again commit  sin after being forgiven as they now were they would not again be forgiven but the Justice of the Law would be brought against  them &amp; they would have to pay the penalty or be cut off from the  Church again I told them they should not boast of their authority  &amp; power or that a seventy was greater than a High Priest or that a  High Priest was greater than a seventy no man should boast of the power of the priesthood untill he obtained some of that power &amp; it was manifested upon him &amp; when that was upon him he certainly  would not boast of it for the Holy spirit would teach him sens enough  to know better. It is vary seldom that I have known the power of  the pr vary great Degree but in some instances it was manifest as in the case of the prophet Joseph at the time his  dying &amp; his door Yard &amp; they were strewed along the bank of the River  for 2 miles &amp; Joseph Rose up &amp; shook himself like an old L &amp; commenced at his own tent door &amp; healed all the people who was not dead on both sides of the river by the power of God his voice was  as the voice of God &amp; the earth almost trembled under his feet as he com- manded the sick to arise &amp; be made whole. It was also manifest with  Joseph while made fast in chains &amp; in prision in Missouri &amp; his wicked ungodly persecuters gathered around him &amp; while he was made fast in chains with his  of how many murders they had commited &amp; rapes upon mormon women  &amp; how they had cut the mormons to peices then they would blaspheme the name of God untill his spirit was reigned up &amp; he rose up in the power of God in the midst of his chains &amp; spoke as in the voice of thunder "Silence  ye fiends of the pit. I will not live another moment &amp; hear such vile  language from mortals, either you or I shall die right here or els you shall scease from boasting of  of."  They quailed before his words like leather wilting in the flames &amp; they bowed before him &amp; made acknowledgements to him this was done by the power of God. "Again David Patten was taken by an armed mob under a United States warrant &amp; when he was surrounded with an armed mob of about 40 men under the garb of Law &amp; would not let him say one word in his own defence but he arose in the power of God &amp; held them fast to their seats  untill he addressed them about 1/2 an hour he told them they were cowards  rascals &amp; villans &amp; he proved it to them, &amp; they had not power to harm a hair  of His head &amp; they let him &amp; Warren Parrish go, away. Again this power was manifest with President Brigham Young on the bank of the Missouri River at Winter Quarters when the merchants brought up goods to sell to the brethren   ENDENTRY  surrounded by officers &amp; Miller in order to show his great power He told the merchants that owned some Alcohol not to roll a Barrel of  boat that He would knock the head in &amp; spill it upon the ground president  Young steped up &amp; told the men to roll it out &amp; if miller spilled it that moment I will spill his clarret He &amp; all the officers turned pale the liquor  was rolled out &amp; nobody hurt. And other instances might be named when  the power of the priesthood has been manifest but these men have never  boasted of it nor never will I made many other remarks. I was followed  by Lorenzo Snow who spoke well.    ENDENTRY February 18, 1857    &amp; E. Hunter was in the office &amp; conversed upon many things. I copy the following report from the presidency a month since. He said that is (President Young) that He wished the Brethren at Kimball  said that I dont want to see the Presidents of the seventies in the stand untill they get more of the spirit of God for they are dead &amp; the seventies have to receive  their food through them. Brother Young said I do not wish to have Father Morley not to seal any more men &amp; women without my consent I was troubled with the teeth ake. I took an instrumen &amp; dug a stump  of a tooth out of my Jaw that was broke off level at the Gum it was  a tedious operation.

But I think I am the great man that none of the prophets  ever thought of or spoke of.    from a Departed spirit he comes to him dressed in his temple Robes &amp; the man he comes to has not had his endowments and I want to know what you think of it I thought the whole of it smelt strongly of Brimstone    believe that that is a true visit about the third time he comes He will say that this Church is not led by the man that ought to lead  it but the man that has thos visits will tell you that he is to lead the Church. Now I will tell you how you may know it is fals a spirit  will not come to a man in the flesh without he appears in his glory &amp; men cannot endure his glory a resurrected body may come  &amp; hide his glory. but that visitation is false it is not true    others were there as missionaries several spoke I followed with few remarks &amp; was followed by O Hyde    ENDENTRY March 9, 1857    grape vines    ENDENTRY March 10, 1857    the day in the office I attended the missionary meeting in the evening  &amp; had a good time I spoke a short time at the close of the meeting   ENDENTRY March 11, 1857    the after noon in the office    ENDENTRY March 12, 1857    plum in my Garden this fore noon I spent the afternoon in the office    ENDENTRY March 13, 1857       ENDENTRY March 14, 1857    afternoon I spent in the Young called in &amp; Herd  History read nearly all the afternoon He heard a part of his  own history read, &amp; a part of the continuation of the History of the  the Death of A. O. Smoots Bishop  J Horn was present with their wives    ENDENTRY March 15, 1857    followed by Kimball who  spoke at length. In the afternoon President Young spoke a vary  interesting sermon from the following text "who is my Father Mother  Brothers &amp; sisters they are those who do the will of my father which  is in heaven." ##Matthew 12:50## I attended the prayer Circle. President Young  said he had the following dream. I thought we had a great  crop of wheat the whole Earth was filled with it all around the  Heads were very long &amp; there was so much of it the people  did not seem to care any thing about it, did not try to save  it I had to continually urge the people to save the wheat they  said they had more than they wanted for this year I told them  to go to &amp; save all the wheat they had then next year they could  work on the Temple."    Jumbo Corn some man plants an acre &amp; takes great care of it &amp;  he gets a great crop of it, the way they got corn so early they  will take the ear that sets first &amp; pull the silk out of all the rest  then plant the but part of that Ear &amp; that will make early corn  now that is the way with the best breed of cattle, they keep picking  out the best for stock, &amp; that increases the goodness of them.

Brother Joseph Young spoke to the people in a vary edefying manner exhorted them to get the spirit of God   ENDENTRY  like bearing testimony to what brother Joseph had said his teachings  were Just &amp; true. You cannot edify this people without you speak by  the Holy Ghost a man may have all the Eloquence of a Cicero or  the knowledge of the world combined &amp; he cannot feed the immortal  mind of a Latter Day saint unless he speaks by the spirit of God. He may talk of visions &amp; revelations or any thing Els unless he has the spirit  of God He will not edefy this people look at the teaching of the prophet  Joseph all other men might preach though many might preach by the  spirit of the Lord &amp; Edify the people yet if the people knew that Joseph  was going to preach the people would poor out of their houses like bees out of a Hive. So with President Young at this day if the people knew  that He was going to preach they would fill the Tabernacle an hour before  the time of meeting. his words are plain &amp; easy but they are filled  with the spirit &amp; power of God unto Edification       ENDENTRY March 17, 1857    found great difficulty in obtaining any thing for the History of  those who had apostitized. I attended the meeting of the Bishops  Bishop Hunter spoke &amp; said he wished the clerk to keep a strict  Account of their meetings as it would make a good History He  councilled the Bishops to finish the canal &amp; do all that is required of  them. Joseph Young spoke said that was the first time that He ever  attended a Bishops meeting in his life He spoke vary well I followed  him FIGURE The following is a Brief synopsis of my remarks I said I felt  to say a few words we have had a good exertation from Brother Joseph  Young He said some had thought that we should have the privilege of  coming to thes vallies &amp; setting down &amp; resting but he thought that we had  as much to do as ever I think so to I am thoroughly converted to  the faith that we shall never arive at that period of existance when  we shall not have sumthing to do I believe our work will increase  throughout all Eternity though we may not have to gain our bread  by the sweat of our brow neither shall we always have to cultivate  the soil in the midst of thornes &amp; briers. Our Father in Heaven is  always busy his kingdom &amp; works are increaseing &amp; I believe it  will be the same with us throughout all Eternity if we are saved. There  is another subject which I wish to speak of. Brother Hunter said that  He wanted the clerk to keep a record of their meetings as it would  make a good History this is a subject I have always felt interested in &amp; as there are many branches in the kingdom of God so their should  be some persons engaged in each branch I have often spoken upon  this subject &amp; I have often thought that to many it was dry and  uninteresting  a history of what transpires with us from day to day. I was deeply  impressed with the importance of this subject to day while reading the History  of the organization of the quorum of the Twelve and the remarks of the  Prophet Joseph upon the subject. He said -"I have for myself learned a fact  by experience which on reflection gives me much sorrow. It is a truth  that if I now had in my possession evry decission which has been given  upon important items of Doctrin &amp; duties since the rise of this church  they would be of incalculable worth to the saints but we have neglected  to keep a record of such things thinking perhaps that they never  benefit us afterwords which had we now would decide almost   ENDENTRY  to the Church nor unto the world of the great &amp; glorious manifestation  that have been made to us with that degree of power and authority  which we otherwise could if we had those decissions to publish abroad  FIGURE Since the Twelve are now chosen I wish to tell them a course which they may persue &amp; be benefited here after in a point of light  of which they perhaps are not now aware. At all times when  you assemble in the capacity of a council to transact business let the  oldest of your Number preside &amp; let one or more be appointed to keep  a record of your procedings &amp; on the decission of evry important  item let it be what it may let such decission be noted down and  they will ever after words remain upon record as LAW covenants  &amp; doctrin. Questions thus decided might at the time appear unimportant  but should they be recorded &amp; one of you lay hands upon them after  words you might find them of infinate worth not ownly to your  brethren but a feast also to your own souls"     ant (subjects) or questions &amp; pass decissions  omit to record such decisions by &amp; by you will be driven to straits  from which you will not be able to extricate yourselves &amp; not being  in a situation to bring your faith to bear with sufficient perfection  or power to obtain the desired information. Now in consequence of  a neglect to write these things when God revealed them not essteeming  them of sufficient worth the spirit may withdraw &amp; God may be angry  and here is a fountain of intelligence or knowledge of infinate  importance which is lost. what was the cause of this the answer  is slothfulness or Neglect to appoint a man to occupy a few moments  in writing" "FIGURE Here Let me prophesy the time will come when if  you neglect to do this you will fall by the Hands of  were you to be brought before the authorities and accused of any crime  or misdemienor and be as innocent as the angels of God unless you can  prove that you were some whare els your Enemies will prevail against  you but if you can bring Twelve men to testify that you were in some  other place at that time you will escape there hands now if you  will be careful to keep minutes of these things as I have said it  will be one of the most important &amp; interesting records ever seen I have now laid these things before you  are left to act according to your own Judgment"- (See record of the  Twelve Historians office) ^and History of the Church February 1835^ I have thus refered to sume of the words of  Joseph to the Twelve Apostles at their organization. This shows the  feelings of the Prophet Joseph upon this subject I have had this  same subject upon my mind ever since I have been a member  of the church I have been inspired &amp; moved upon to keep a Journal  &amp; write the affairs of this church as far as I can I did not understand  why my feelings was exercised so much in the early age of this church  but I understand it now I seldom ever heard Brother Joseph or the  Twelve preach or teach any principle but what I felt as uneasy as  a fish out of water untill I had written it then I felt right I  could write a sermon of Josephs a week after it was delivered almost  word for word &amp; after it was written it was taken from me or from  my mind this was a gift from God unto me and I have kept a  Journal of almost evry day of my life for the last 24 years I could  tell each day what I had done, what company I was in &amp; what  was transpiring around me and any teachings or councils from the  presidency of the Church except whare I knew that reporters had   ENDENTRY  &amp; all the corums of the Church to keep a record of there meetings &amp; the  dealings of God with them &amp; for all men who bear the Priesthood  to keep a record of their lives esspecially of all their official acts in  the church &amp; kingdom of God. You may say that this is a great deal  of trouble vary well it has been to me in one sens it has occupied  nearly evry leasure moment of my time for 24 years but what of it  I have never spent any of my time more profitably for the benefit of  manking mankind than in my Journal writing for a great portion of the Church  History has been compiled from my Journals &amp; some of the most glorious Gospel sermons truths &amp; revelations that were given from God to this people  through the mouth of the Prophets Heber &amp; the Twelve could  not be found upon the Earth on record ownly in my Journals &amp; they are  compiled in the Church History &amp; transmitted to the saints of God in  all future Generations does not this pay me for my trouble it does in  many instances in this Church men have been appointed clerks  to write for the church they have kept the records instead of  delivering them to the President of the Church whare they belonged &amp; some  they would appostitize then they would insult the Church by offer- ing to sell them their own records at an enormous price. I have  deposited my records &amp; Journals in the Historians office whare I  hope they may do some good. we have had a vary interesting time this winter during the referamation among the Latter day saints  the spirit &amp; power of God has been poured out in a wonderful  manner &amp; many glorious truths have been revealed through  the presidency Twelve &amp; others &amp; in the various quorums meeting  now should not their be a record kept of these things in the comm- encement of these meeting the clerks took quite full reports  but thinking it to much trouble they now take them vary short &amp;  we can hardly get an outline of the real facts of our meetings  &amp; the power of God &amp; the dealings of God with us evry man should  write a brief history of his life his parentage, His birth his  religion when he was baptized &amp; by whom when ordained what  to &amp; by whome give a brief sketch of all his missions &amp; of all his  offical acts &amp; the dealings of God with him then if He was to  die &amp; the Historians wished to publish his history they would  have sumthing to go by. Many may think this a dry subjet  &amp; unimportant but it is not so to me I am now trying to  get up a history of the Twelve Apostles as first organized  half of them are now out of the Church &amp; scarsly any record  left whareby I can get a correct knowledge of their ministry  or work &amp; some of those who remain &amp; are labouring to  build up the kingdom of God have not kept a record of  their missions ministry offical acts &amp; decission upon important  subjects &amp; the gifts graces &amp; dealings of God with them sufficient to  give a true &amp; corret History of their lives their are but  few aside from the presidency of this church who feel the import- ance of this subjet sufficent to put it in practice. It may be  considered by some not important to write or keep a record of our  work or the work of God but I believe it is otherwise the Prophets  would not have been moved upon to exhort us to faithfulness upon  this subject the Lord has told us that what we seal on Earth shall  be sealed in heaven &amp; what we record on Earth shall be recorded  in heaven &amp; what is not sealed or recorded on Earth is not sealed   ENDENTRY  that we do keep a true &amp; faithful record in all things. while walking  in a rapid stream we cannot tread twice in the same water neither  can we spend twice the same time when we pass out of that  door the work of this meeting will be closed to us forever we shall  never spend the time of this evening again then should we not keep  a record of our work teachings &amp; council which we give in this  meeting we should. again Elders go forth upon missions to the  Nations of the Earth they have to Enter into a regular warfare the  Lord pours out his Holy Spirit upon them &amp; they war with the world  the flesh, &amp; the Devil, with kings, princes, Lords, Presidents &amp; rulers  He is cast into prision the Lord delivers him. The Devil enters into  some of his converts &amp; He lays hands upon them &amp; he cast them out,  the saints are sick &amp; he heals them, He prophesies in the name of  the Lord &amp; his words come to pass. Rulers declair that He shall not  preach to the people on pain of death. He preaches the word of God &amp;  many believe obey &amp; rejoice in the Lord &amp; he is protected by the  power of God. He goes upon the Sea the storms rage &amp; he calms the water &amp; wind in the name of the Lord. He is shielded &amp; guarded  by angels of God all the day long &amp; he knows the power of God is with him &amp; reveals unto him all the evils that lie in his path  And yet he does not view thise great &amp; important things of  value enough to make a record of them to spend a short time in writing them &amp; the circumstances &amp; history of those blessings  unto him are lost both to the present &amp; all future generation. are  these things wright I do not believe they are. I do not believe a man  is Justified in neglecting to record these things.     come pouring down upon us in the Land of Zion Led by the Holy prophets  of God what would be one of the first inquiries we should make  of them it would be whare are your records &amp; history &amp; the  revelations &amp; dealings of God with you since you were lead away  under Shalmanezar king of Asyria? O do let me see them &amp;  read them &amp; do let me  North country to Our land of Zion &amp; what would be our disappo- intment should the prophets &amp; Elders say O we have not got any  history of the dealings of God with us nor any Journal of our  travels we used to hear our Fathers say that there hath been  great &amp; mighty things done in the Land whare we lived the savior  come &amp; taught great &amp; marvellous things &amp; we had a glorious time  in coming here we smote the rocks &amp; the mighty mountains of Ice  fell down with a great noise &amp; great mir our Fathers had so much to do &amp; we have had so much to do that we never  had any time to write any thing about it &amp; we did not think that  any body would have any interest in it but ourselves &amp; so we did  not write. would we not be awfully disappointed we should &amp; so  with them should they ask for our records &amp; say that Jesus &amp; the Angels  had told  in the Earth &amp; that great &amp; glorious things were revealed unto you  &amp; we now wish to read these things &amp; should we tell them that we had  done as they had that we had not kept a record of any of these things  they would be like ourselves much disappointed, but if they &amp; ourselves  should both keep a strict record of all that is useful then it would  add great Joy to both them &amp; us.

I do not wish to say much about this case but I think many things that I do not  want to say their is many women that care more about their   kingdom &amp; if a man was to submit to such women he would  not be worth shucks in building up the kingdom of God I have got  some such woman &amp; I visit them one a year or once in 3 years as  I please &amp; they may go to heaven or Hell just as they please I  shall not turn away from the work of God for any woman if the  people will follow the council of the 14 led into the kingdom of God &amp; so will Agness but she wants pillow  council instead of ward council well now if Agnes never hears  any more pillow council or private council take the council which  he gives to the whole ward &amp; you will be saved men must attend  to the duties of the kingdom of God first before any other object  and Now Agnes go home &amp; do right &amp; Brother Hoagland go &amp; Baptize  her if she wishes to be &amp; so here the matter droped    Candlin &amp; D Willkie addressed the meeting was followed by W Woodruff  &amp; F.

Smith sermons read we conversed upon the subject of the present excitement in the states concerning mormonism we then went into the Temple Block to see the form of the first water table made of white sand stone I then went into the president office &amp; spent the evening Bishop Blackburn was present the subject came up of some persons leaving Provo who had Apostitized some thought that  Bishop Blackburn &amp; President Snow was to blame Brother Joseph Young presented the thing to president Young. But when the circumstances were told President Brigham Young sustained the Brethren who pres- ided at Provo He said they had done blank The subjects of Eunuchs came up &amp; Joseph said that He would rath er die than to be made a Eunuch Brigham said the day would come when thousands would be made Eunuchs in order for them to be  saved in the kingdom of God. The subject of women &amp;  Adulterry came up Joseph Asked if a woman &amp; man who  were married could commit Adultery Brigham said that Joseph said they could not yet He was satisfied they could do wrong Presi- dent Young said we cannot  will not bear it. Joseph I am willing to have the people Clens the  platter if they can do it in righteousness &amp; Judge righteous Judg- ment. Brigham. This people never was half as well prepared  to execute righteousness as Now. I will tell you that when a man is trying to do right &amp; do some thing that is not exactly in order  I feel to sustain him &amp; we all should. I wish there was some prophet on Earth who could tell us just how much sin we must sustain before we can chastize the people &amp; correct their errors. The wicked may  go to the states &amp; call for troops I dont think the people will get rich   ENDENTRY  got to Join hands with sin &amp; sinners or we have got to fight them The subject of Adultery again came up Joseph said a man cannot commit Adultery with his wife so says the revelation on the Patriarchs marriage yet a man can do rong in having connexion with his his wife at times Joseph Young  a man should not put away his wife  if He did they would both commit Adultery. Brigham Young said Joseph taught that when a womans affections was entirly weaned from her husband that was Adultery in spiri her  Affections were Adulterated from his He also said that there was No law in Heaven or on Earth that would compel a  woman to stay with a man either in time or Eternity this  I think is true (but I do not know) that if a man that is a High  priest takes a woman &amp; she leaves him &amp; goes to one of a lesser  office say the Lesser priesthood or member I think in the  resurrection that that High Priest can claim her "Joseph what if she should not want to go with him I should not want a woman under those circumstances. Brigham I will tell you what you will find that all those evil traditions &amp; affections or passions that Haunt the mind in this life will all be done  away in the resurrection you will find then that any man who gets a glory &amp; exaltation will be so beautiful that any woman would  be willing to have him if it was right &amp; wharever it is right for the woman to go there she will be willing to go for all those evils will vanish to which we are subject in this life. I have told the people the truth Just as it is but others will at times get up &amp; tell the people that they will get no heaven ^FIGURE^ ownly what they make in this life and that it will be in the next world as  it is in this now they do not mean whaat they say they do not explain themselves Hence the people will not understand what is said to them. Joseph said I wish I knew what my limits  were. Brigham Your limits are endless &amp; you have not got half way to the end of it yet. Now  willing to correct an Error in the Brethren as I am now. But  the people do not see it so. Now if you should be with the 12  or any body you would have a right to correct an Error as  well as with a member but you could not correct them by cutting them off from the Church because they are over you in the priesthood. many other remarks were made at the time    ENDENTRY June 3, 1857    most of the day with him I bought a yoke of 4 year old yoked of Durham Oxen deep red paid $125 for them of A Lyman  arived home this evening with the Calafornia mail    ENDENTRY June 4, 1857    FIGURE I wrote a letter to the western standard    ENDENTRY June 5, 1857       ENDENTRY June 6, 1857       ENDENTRY June 7, 1857    in the morning was followed by Young   ENDENTRY  I attended the Prayer circle I herd a letter redd from Joseph Smith to his Brother John which was good it showed his strong determination in the work. it rained nearly all night    ENDENTRY June 8, 1857    fell on a level I attended the meeting of the board of Directers we  appointed the Awarding Committees. san Bernadeno at 7 oclok this evening    ENDENTRY June 9, 1857    evening to see my wheat I never saw crops better    ENDENTRY June 10, 1857    with Porter Rockwell the After noon I spent in the office with G A Smith    ENDENTRY
