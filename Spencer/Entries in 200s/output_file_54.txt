 Since writing the following it has occurred to me that JoeRawlins has served you fellows right after all. No Latter-Day Saintspossessing common sense would have dreamt of nominating Joe for suchan important office. But then of course I am not fit to judge, being only a c. W. you knowHon. Geo. Q CannonI can well imagine how flattered and proud you are after having beingcomplimented so much of late in Gentile society.  It is a fine thing to associate with the elite and the cream of society and to be complimented by the Trib with such choicephrases as "one of the most felicitous speakers," or "one of the most charming speakers."Of course your whole life is bent on becoming "great" and "illustrious," and I, for one, would not care a straw for your vanity for we all have some weak point or another.But when I contemplate how I and my innocent little ones have suffered for the commonnecessaries of life, just, as I have reason to believe, because I am not stylish enough to suit one of the "leaders" in the Pres. O. ^I cannot help thinking.^ I need not mention his name.But it is childish to talk thus to a great man like you. As you are well awareI am friendless and helpless, and if I am driven to hell why should you care so long as you and yours and the elits are well taken care of.I am yours very trulyC. W. P. S. The signature, "C. W." are the initials of the pet name by which BillSpence used to call me.Note:The writer of the above is Daniel L Daniels. It havingbeen suspected that he was the author, Bro. Rossiter called upon him and charged him with having written it, and he acknowledgedhaving done so. After being convinced that he himself left the office because his salary had been cut down from $1200 to $1000., he expressed regrets that he had written it, and asked Bro. R.to so inform Prest.

For this reason we would be very sorry to have him leave us, and we therefore respectfully ask you to allow him to remain with us for another year as he is willing to do so in case you see fit to grant him this privilege. At the end of that time he will be better prepared financially, to accomplish a successful mission, and then we will have no objection to his going. We have labored under many disadvantages in getting teachers suitable for our school, but since Bro.Hanson has been here the children are learning much better, the parents are taking increasedinterest and our school now has the name of being the best in the County, and we hopewith his aid to make it first class in every respect during the coming season.

 327 W. S. Temple StSALT LAKE CITY.  UTAH. Agugust 4th, 1893.President Wilford Woodruff, City.Dear Brother:Replying to your call of the 2nd inst, I would say that I am perfectly willing to do my share to the best of my ability in helping to roll forward this greatwork, realizing as I do that it must of necessity be done. Regarding my circumstances financially, would say that I am at present owing some moneyon my home but the rent of the place will more than pay the interest on that and I therefor feel I can shape matters ^by knowing some more^ so as to be able to start at the time mentioned, though being a member of the Tabernacle Choir it would help me a little if I could start with them when they leave for Chicago.I would here mention and ask your acquiescence in the taking of my wifeand two children.  I shall have no way whatever of providing for them here, but, as my wife's parents are in England and well able and willing to keep her and the children I think it would be much better to take them over with me.  Her parents, though not in the Church, have always received the travelling Elders with great kindness and we bothfeel that in all probability my wife could eventually lead them to see the light of theGospel.  At all events she would be able to dispel some of the many calumnious taleswhich have been circulated by our enemies in that neighborhood since her departure for Zion some years ago.Not wishing to weary you with a long letter I would say in conclusion that her parentsare now quite aged and would be overjoyed to have her and the children stay with themas long as they could.  Therefor, taking everything into consideration I think it would be well for them to accompany me.  Trusting I may be favored with your reply on this matter at as early a date as possible I remain,Your Brother in the Gospel of Christ, Albert John SeareBishop Elias Morris15th Ward
