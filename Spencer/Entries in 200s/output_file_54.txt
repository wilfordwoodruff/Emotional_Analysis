 Since writing the following it has occurred to me that Joe  Rawlins has served you fellows right after all. No Latter-Day Saints  possessing common sense would have dreamt of nominating Joe for such  an important office. But then of course I am not fit to judge, being   only a c. W. you know    Hon. Geo. Q Cannon    I can well imagine how flattered and proud you are after having being  complimented so much of late in Gentile society.  It is a fine thing to associate with   the elite and the cream of society and to be complimented by the Trib with such choice  phrases as "one of the most felicitous speakers," or "one of the most charming speakers."  Of course your whole life is bent on becoming "great" and "illustrious," and I, for one,   would not care a straw for your vanity for we all have some weak point or another.  But when I contemplate how I and my innocent little ones have suffered for the common  necessaries of life, just, as I have reason to believe, because I am not stylish enough   to suit one of the "leaders" in the Pres. O. ^I cannot help thinking.^ I need not mention his name.    But it is childish to talk thus to a great man like you. As you are well aware  I am friendless and helpless, and if I am driven to hell why should you   care so long as you and yours and the elits are well taken care of.    I am yours very truly  C. W.   P. S. The signature, "C. W." are the initials of the pet name by which Bill  Spence used to call me.    Note:  The writer of the above is Daniel L Daniels. It having  been suspected that he was the author, Bro. Rossiter called upon   him and charged him with having written it, and he acknowledged  having done so. After being convinced that he himself left the   office because his salary had been cut down from $1200 to $1000.,   he expressed regrets that he had written it, and asked Bro. R.  to so inform Prest. Cannon.    G. F. Gibbs May 15 [18]93.

 Kanosh May 16 [18]93.    Wilford Woodruff,  Salt Lake City,  Dear Brother:    We learn from our teacher,  Bro. George M. Hanson that he has been  called to take a mission to England. We  very much regret that this is the case, as  he has been our teacher, and he is getting  our school in a first class condition. For   this reason we would be very sorry to have   him leave us, and we therefore respectfully   ask you to allow him to remain with us   for another year as he is willing to do so   in case you see fit to grant him this   privilege. At the end of that time he will   be better prepared financially, to accomplish   a successful mission, and then we will   have no objection to his going. We have   labored under many disadvantages in getting   teachers suitable for our school, but since Bro.  Hanson has been here the children are learning   much better, the parents are taking increased  interest and our school now has the name   of being the best in the County, and we hope  with his aid to make it first class in every   respect during the coming season. Bro. Hanson   informs us that he is to leave Salt Lake on   June 24, and he is making preparations to do so,

July 3rd. 1893    Pres. Wilford Woodruff,  Salt Lake City,    Dear Brother:- Your unexpected letter, dated  June 26th, was received this morning, announcing my  call to fill a mission to New Zeland.    Believing that every young man who performs  an honorable mission to the nations of the earth, will  be greatly blest, I do not feel that it would be proper nor  even desirable, through any refusal on my part to deny  myself of any blessing that can thus be obtained.    Although I am pushed very closely financially, through  the assistance of God, I hope to be able, to meet all require-  ments.    I cheerfully accept the call, and my heart is filled  with gratitude, that I am counted worthy to assist in  preaching the Gospel, to the world.    Any information, relative to the time when I should be  in Salt Lake City, and when I will be apt to find company, and  what will be my needs will be very thankfully received.    Your brother in the Gospel — John Johnson —  I endorse the above  J I Jensen Bp    [Written on top right margin around letterhead]  All right, give him the information he needs  J.F.S.

If they   can spend the means & time to test   the well-boring question, and if suc-  cessful, enough land could be   reclaimed thereby to make a settlement   where schools & meetings could be had  All right—other wise they had better locate  nearer to our settlements.

I feel to hesitate before engaging to ac-  cept the position, offered, and would not ask  you to consent for them to have the Tabern-  acle unless you judgment approved of me acting  and them having the building.

 327 W. S. Temple St    SALT LAKE CITY.  UTAH.   Agugust 4th, 1893.    President Wilford Woodruff,   City.    Dear Brother:    Replying to your call of the 2nd inst, I would say that I am perfectly   willing to do my share to the best of my ability in helping to roll forward this great  work, realizing as I do that it must of necessity be done.   Regarding my circumstances financially, would say that I am at present owing some money  on my home but the rent of the place will more than pay the interest on that and I   therefor feel I can shape matters ^by knowing some more^ so as to be able to start at the time mentioned, though   being a member of the Tabernacle Choir it would help me a little if I could start with   them when they leave for Chicago.    I would here mention and ask your acquiescence in the taking of my wife  and two children.  I shall have no way whatever of providing for them here, but, as my   wife's parents are in England and well able and willing to keep her and the children   I think it would be much better to take them over with me.  Her parents, though not in   the Church, have always received the travelling Elders with great kindness and we both  feel that in all probability my wife could eventually lead them to see the light of the  Gospel.  At all events she would be able to dispel some of the many calumnious tales  which have been circulated by our enemies in that neighborhood since her departure   for Zion some years ago.    Not wishing to weary you with a long letter I would say in conclusion that her parents  are now quite aged and would be overjoyed to have her and the children stay with them  as long as they could.  Therefor, taking everything into consideration I think it would   be well for them to accompany me.  Trusting I may be favored with your reply on this   matter at as early a date as possible I remain,    Your Brother in the Gospel of Christ,   Albert John Seare    Bishop Elias Morris  15th Ward

You say  you Should like to have me  start as early as Sep 23rd1893  I would say that if my name  has been suggested to you as  an Elder as your letter states  there is a mistake as I   only hold the Office of a Priest  Should it be correct I will  ask if I can have a little   more time in getting ready  We people living in the country  have most of our hard hard work   to do in the fall

 I have not been able to get    my pay yet. The parties that   are owing me are mormons. There  homes are in spanish Fork. There   were quite a few of the Spanish-   Fork Brethren came to Soda Springs   and contracted to make a canell  from Soda Spring to Bandcroft.  The company they contacted of,   payed them [uf] the fore part of   the season and the company went  broke or failed to pay the Brethren   all they owed them. The Brethren   left here owing me and quite a number   of others some of the merchants at  Soda Springs that does not be long  to the Church prety heavy bills.  When they left here they made faith-  ful promises they would send   us our money but they have failed  to do so yet. They donot think   anough of us to answer our letters.

 Mt Pleasant Aug. 17, 1893.  Brother: Woodilford Woodruff    Your letter of the 13 ult.  at hand I have consulted my   Father and he prefures my   going to Denmark.

I see by the ^call^ there is a provision  alowing for temporal afairs. Now  I am considerabely envolved in   debt owing to Father and my   self investing considerable money   in sheep 
 This will be all right, but  I would advise him not to   sell anything his family might   need in his absence, but   rather, seek to get or earn   the means in some other   way, even if it takes more  time.  J. F. S.

I would be obliged to borrow all  the money and pay interest thereon,  as well as being involved for land  already.

The only apology I have to offer for addressing  you at the present time, is the interest I take   in, and the feelings with which I have been   impressed of late on the subject, and the necessity  of Establishing a "Bureau," of genealogy with us   that all rich and poor alike can do work  for their dead.    Realizing that forces are at work  on the outside, and elements on the inside of  the nations of the gentiles, which are sure to lead  in the near future to disaster and bloodshed,  hence the necessity of securing while we can,  any and all records attainable on the subject   of genealogies, peedigrees, Town, County and Family   Histories, &c.    Good men qualified for, and who   have the work at heart could be set apart to   secure all such works before it is too late, the

 And on acount of the stringen-  cy of the times we have not   been able to meet our liabilities  But I think if I can be  released for one year or even  8 months we will be able   to raise our Debt.

 for same.    If I did not get married  my missionary duties might  suffer more or less, having my  thoughts too much on those  I leave behind.    I would like very much, if it  would be consistent with your  wishes, that she might be called  on the same mission. It is her  desire. She is well versed in the  principles of the Gospel, and a   thorough Latter Day Saint and  is not afraid to stand up, and  expound the principles of the  Gospel.

Wilford Woodruff  Salt Lake City, Utah    Dear Brother—I received  your letter of the 1st. inst.,  calling me to go upon a  mission to Tasmania,  which I can assure you  was indeed a great  surprise to me.  I did  not expect to be called for  at least two years yet.

 failoure this year where  we havant any water to  ertrigate with.  And togather  with my indebtedness  I just got married last  March  and havant anything  else to live ^in^ only a summer  Shanty consequently under  the circumstances I am unable  to see how I could go at  presant but I am willing  to perform the mittion in  the future when I may  be beter able to do so.    Yours Respectfully  Lars C Larsen Jr.    I believe the above statement  ia correct  W. C. Parkinson  Bp    Give him time, and say to him  to  report when he gets ready.  J.F.S.

 Franklin  8/8 [18]93    President Wilford Woodruff.  Salt Lake City    Dear Brother:    I understand that the climate  of Soamoa is hot & unhealthful.    As I have been under the doctors care  for some time, lately having a tumor  taken from my neck by Dr. O. C. Ormsby  and as I cannot stand the heat very  well on that account I would beg you  to change my mission to Sandwich Isls,  if satisfactory    I asked advice from Dr Ormsby, he told me  to lay the case before you and let you decide  for yourself.  I would like to go and fulfill  an honorable mission, and If you can make  the change advantagesouly I would be very grateful  to you, if not I will be satisfied    Your Brother  Wm Mendenhall  Franklin  Idaho    All right, let him go to  Sandwich Isles.

 from school, I got  married.  So all together  I am not in a very good  condition, financially,  and furthermore have  not been able to obtain  employment this summer.    I ^have^ taken considerable time  since receiving the call, to  try and arrive at the  right conclusion, as to  whether I should go right  at the desired time, or to  ask for a year's time; but  I think after considering  all things, it would  almost be better to go when  I am called, although it  will be pretty hard to raise  sufficient means, or to  obtain assistance from other  sources. 
 All right.  Make the appointment  and let them know.  J. F. S.    Glenwood Aug 22rd 1893    President Wilford Woodruff  Salt Lake City  Dear brother.    In regard to the call made upon  us last spring, to fill a mission  to Scandinavia. We expect with  the help of the Lord to be ready  to go this cuming fall,  and would be very glad  to know as soon as it is  possable, Just when we are  expected to leave Salt Lake,  as we can then make our  arangements accordingly    hoping to hear from you at your  earliest convenience we are your  brethren.
