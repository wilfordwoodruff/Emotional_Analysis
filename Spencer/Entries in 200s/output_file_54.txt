Therefore I, a humble member of this great body of people, ask that before giving this money into their hands, you will see that the right kind of people are there to handle it.  See that lall its offi- cers are Utionians -- that no man will receive a benefit, unless it be the reflection of a "work well done."  If Judge Colborn works ion this celebration, I hesitate not to prophecy that he will receive as much, if not more benefit from it, than all the Utonians combined, or at least, will receive his  share.  All statements I make, I can, and will at any time verify.  I therefore ask that you put (or see it is done) on that committtee, more suhch men as H. G. Whitney, Mrs. Snell and of the same kind.  It is not--or should not be the carpet-baggers to control money that the people they hate so, shuld furnish.  In closing I beg to ask that you will give this communication your careful consideration, and not throw aside as worthless.  With deepest respect, and with the iw^wi^sh that God may guide you aright in the matter, I am,  Your brother in the gospel, Briant S Young.  I beg to state if there is anything further wanted in the way of information, I will gladly give it.

Dear Brethren:  I received a notice from you some years ago asking me to prepare and get ready to leave (on a mission to Scandinavia) the 20th of Feb. 1892 not having the means and not know- ing where to obtain it, I asked for an extention of time which were granted me (untill fall of 1893) thinking that I would be able to secure enough  means in that time. I went off to work but had only worked 2 week when I was taken very sick and had to be sent home in that  condition, it took the best part of the summer before I got well.

OFFICE OF UNITED STATES ATTORNEY, DISTRICT OF UTAH,  J. W. JUDD, U.S. ATTORNEY.  Salt Lake City, August 23, 1897., 189  Wilford Woodruff, President, Church of Jesus Christ of L.D.S. Salt Lake City. Utah.  Most Reverend Sir:  I am in receipt of a letter from Geo. E. Hill, one of your Missionaries, directed to me from Waterford, Miss., which I herewith take pleasure in enclosing to you. Permit me a word of explanation:  In more than one instance it has been my pleasure to give a letter of recommendation to your Missionaries when going into my Southern country, especially my State of Tennessee, as well as from time to time having by word of mouth commended them to my people there and solicited kind and christian treatment in their behalf. When Mr. Hill left here last April I gave him a letter—of which he speaks in the enclosure. Of course, with the detailed statement of Mr. Hill's work I have no special concern, except that gratification which comes to any citizen upon learning that another is being well treated and is performing a christian work which, let us hope, is always calculated to better whoever may accept and act upon such teachings. I great- ly appreciate Mr. Hill's painstaking letter to me, for it gives me an insight into the work that I myself before did not understand.  You will note that he asks me for a further letter stating what I know of the people of Utah and of the country in general. I have by this mail written to him in answer stating substantially that I have been all over the State of Utah, from one end of it to the ENDENTRY many things. I have not tried to shirk from any duty that I have been called to perform, for I have been laboring in all callings ^were in I have been called to labor^ in the church since I was called to Scandinavia. It is true that I have many faults and failings, but  I am striving to overcome them by the help of God, for I know that of myself I am nothing.  I have during the last years been laboring as follows—one winter I labored as a home missionary traveling from house to house, preaching the Gospell. I have taken a 5 months M.I.A course, labored as Principle of Religion Classes in 7th Ward, for 2 years. I have been counselor START HERE in M.I.A. for a number of years, and a teacher in the Sabbath School, and in all of these labors, the Lord has greatly blessed me.  Dear Brethren, I hope you will pardon me for describing these thing to you, for I  do not tell you of these things to receive any praise whatever, but that you may better understand things as they are, for I thank the Lord for choosing me to labor in these callings.  My object of writting you is this, I am ENDENTRY Moroni City Oct. 16th 1897.  Presadent Wilford Woodruff, And Brothern of the Committee.  Salt Lake City, Utah.

Upon my recent visit in the South I took some pains to in- quire into the cause of the friction that at times occurs between your missionaries and the people, and am able to state to you one, at least, of the causes which is more fruitful of such troubles. I do this with no disposition to in any way interfere with your direc- tions or the work of your church, but as a piece of information which I feel might be of value to you. The trouble of which I speak comes in this way: The people of Utah have their system of bishops, coun- selors and teachers, and what are called—as I understand it—home or house to house missionaries. They not only see no harm in those practices here at home, but it is a thing, I take it, that is much practiced as well as much appreciated in your system of religious teaching.

And our little daughter that we had when we came, lived to be sixteen years old, and was drowned the 7th of June 1893, her name was Eliza Roxie.  Emma Matilda was our nect girl, she is now seventeen years old, and she has taken a fancy to a young fellow who is not at all worthy of her, and she is so determined we do not know what to do with her.  Now could you advise us to move to an ot- er place or have you a place a farm or some establishment that you would like an industrious family to come to for we are all good willing workers.

I do not believe that all of them do this, in fact I know they do not, but some are sufficiently indiscreet to undertake the conversion and baptism of the women and children in the absence of the head of the family, and you can well see what results a thing of this kind would produce.  It is my opinion that your people will be as well received in the East as the advocates of any church in the land provided they will adopt the methods that ministers of other churches adopt; at least I know such is the case in my State of Tennessee. On my recent visit I took occasion to talk to the people about the Mormons and be- spoke for them kind and hospitable treatment, and in no instance did I hear of any bad feelings against the Mormons, except where it arose out of some such trouble as I have mentioned in this letter.

Whilst he was living in Washington City, and after having two  lectures from him the Secretary wrote this:  Boston, August 21, 1893.  REV. SCOTT F. HERSHEY, PH. D. of Washington, has spoken twice in our Music Hall Course to an immense audience, and we have secured him for another lecture Sept. 17th.  Among all the able and eloquent speakers in the last six years who  have appeared in this course, no one has struck a higher key, and we  shall give him a tremendous ovation when he comes again.  B. F. BRADBURY, Secretary Music Hall Course, Boston.  How He Came to Boston.  It was in 1893 that Dr. Hershey came on from Washington  City to lecture in Boston. At this time the First Presbyterian  Church was without a Pastor. A delegation from the Church  heard him lecture twice, and asked him to consider a call. In the  spring of 1894 he accepted a call to the Church, which stands in  the lead of Presbyterian Churches in New England. The Church  is attended by hundreds of young people and at night the preach- ing is attended by people from all over Boston and the towns about. In addition to his Church work, the Doctor is lecturing every Sunday  afternoon, and from one to two nights a week.  THE BOSTON NEWSPAPERS  Scott F. Hershey is a young, eloquent and convincing orator, whom all should hear.—Boston Globe.  No speaker in the remarkable Music Call Course of six years, em- bracing many of the most eloquent men of the country, is better entitled to the terms "Orator," Scholar," and "Patriot," than is Dr. Hershey.— The Boston Herald.  The lecture in the celebrated Music Hall Course was delivered by  Scott F. Hershey, Ph. D., of Washington, D. C. More than two thou- sand were present, and the frequent, vociferous applause abundantly  testified to the speaker's eloquence. At one time the great audience  at Dr. Hershey's lecture went wild with enthusiasm, rising in a body to  their feet, cheering, and even standing on the seats, as they gave vent to  their feelings.—Boston Citizen.
