I am thankful that I live in this day and generation, that I have received the Gospel and the priesthood, and that the Spirit of God is still with me and my companions. The hand of God is before me and visible to my eye in the great work of this last dispensation to all the inhabi- tants of this world. Yea, the God of Israel will teach this nation, with its congress- men and rulers, the governors, judges, and marshals, and all men, that He is stronger than man, that His purposes fail not, that He is able to perform all that He has set His hand to do, and that he will perform it and bring it to pass in spite of earth or hell, or wicked men or devils, and none can stay his hand. In this I rejoice. We have nothing to discourage us, so far as the Church and Kingdom of God are concerned in their final triumph. Of course we are called to mourn for sin and transgression, whether in the church or out of it. This warfare is with God and the Heavenly hosts on one side, ENDENTRY  P. O. BOX 321,     on the other.

But if we had no trials, in our day, of our faith, we would hardly be at home with the ancient Saints, who were persecuted and martyred for the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ. Whatever weakness we may have as pertaining to our flesh, we certainly ought not to be afraid to lay down our lives for the Gospel's sake if required, and I hope and pray that we may all be prepared for whatever afflictions the Lord has ordained us to pass through.   if I could tell where the October Conference would be held.

Cornelius be blessed with the ministration of a holy angel; ##Acts 10:1-7## but,  though they had been thus favored, to fulfill and comply with  all the requirements of the Lord, it was necessary for them to  be baptized to obtain remission of sins, that they might become the recipients of the Holy Ghost through the ordinance of the laying on of hands, and be enabled to walk in newness of life.  If they had not complied with this requirement, they would  not have been in a suitable condition to have entered into the  kingdom of God.      ing to bring up those who have not had the privilege of hear- ing the gospel while in the flesh, for the simple reason that, in  the spirit world, they cannot officiate in the ordinances of the  house of God. They have passed the ordeals, and are beyond  the possibility of personally officiating for the remission of  their sins and for their exaltation, consequently they are under  the necessity of trusting in their friends, their children and  their children's children to officiate for them, that they may  be brought up into the celestial kingdom of God.      in the Bible to receive a person into the kingdom of God with-  out baptism. Jesus Christ has never given any license, but on  the other hand, He has explicitly said, in the most unequivo- cal language possible, that NO MAN can "enter the kingdom"  without water baptism, or being "born of the water." ##John 3:5##     are faith in God, in Jesus Christ, and in the atonement; re- pentance, reformation, and a godly life; baptism by immer- sion for the remission of sins administered by divine authority,  the sanctifying effects of the blood of Christ that follows the  water, and the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of  hands by properly ordained ministers. These conditions are  as essential to salvation in the kingdom of heaven to-day, as  they were in the days when Christ and His apostles and elders  declared them nearly nineteen hundred years ago. The same  authority has been restored to the earth. The same apostle- ship and keys of priesthood, with power to officiate in the  ordinances of the house of God, are again restored to earth,  and the gospel of God is being preached in all nations for a  witness. The same signs follow the believers according to  their faith, obedience, and the will of God. The same unction  from the Holy One is enjoyed by the Saints, and gives them  a living testimony that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, and  Joseph Smith His servant, ordained to usher in the dispensa- tion of the fullness of times. God has revealed these precious  truths to the Elders and Saints of the Church of Jesus Christ  of Latter-day Saints, and they know they are living in the last  days. Consequently He requires His people whom He hath  redeemed, and unto whom He hath made the Scriptures plain,  to live perfect lives, and to do His will on earth as it is done  in heaven.      sign of an inward grace;" but this is one of the uninspired  precepts of man, and is not a Bible doctrine; instead of bap- tism's being the "sign of an inward grace," it is the ordinance  through which the believing penitent obtains a remission of  sins which justifies and prepares the heart for the reception  "of an inward grace." Remission of sins, and "an inward  grace," do not precede baptism, but follow it.   tized in Jordan, because they had previously received forgive- ness and "an inward grace;" but they came confessing their  sins and were baptized for the remission of them. ##Mark 1:4-5##      and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God." ##John 3:5## An entrance into the kingdom of God, then, cannot be obtained  by a man who has not been born of water and of the Spirit.  Neither sincerity nor morality will avail, except these essential  ordinances have been attended to. Though the Lord is full of  mercy and love for His creatures, yet His justice and truth  would not permit so flagrant a violation of His laws, as the  neglect of these ordinances would be, to pass unpunished;  much less would He break His own word, where He says  that the man who does not attend to these requirements  not     by some that the observance of this ordinance is optional on  the part of the candidate for celestial glory. This is danger- ous doctrine. There is no authority for it in the scriptures.  Jesus and His apostles never taught it. It is contrary to their  teachings. Jesus never included a non-essential principle in  the great plan of salvation. Had not baptism been necessary,  He would not have said to His apostles: "He that believeth  and is       state of the penitent thief on the cross, and of devout and  upright men that have lived and died in every age of the  world, still let God's word be accounted true, and every man  that gainsays it be esteemed a liar! No man ever put on the  uniform of Christ's followers, such as is worn by subjects of  the kingdom of Christ, until he is "baptized into Christ" for  the remission of sins. Hereby he "puts on Christ." ##Romans 13:14##   ENDENTRY  my letter, but it had been sent back to you; the reason of this, ^was^ that soon after I left, the postmaster was  and his brother from Dayton came to ^attend to^ the postoffice for him, and as he did not know me, nor where I had gone, when your letter came he sent it back.

He should also use caution in drinking cold water. When a person is warm and thirsty he is very liable to drink too much at a time. Ice-water in warm weather is not the proper drink for anyone, and should not be used if avoidable.   to stand up part of the time and sit down another part. Too much sitting or standing is likely to be injurious. While sit- ting, standing or walking, keep the body erect, with the shoul- ders thrown back, so the lungs will not be cramped, and to prevent consumption.   are the more they tend to health and comfort. By keeping the body upright, by closing the mouth when not in use, by avoiding too much boistersous laughter, by appearing cheerful, pleasant and good-natured, and by keeping our temper we can enjoy better health than we can otherwise; so that the rules of deportment which are calculated to make us agreeable to our associates will also often prove good to preserve health.   happen to get your clothing dampened through being exposed in a rainstorm or by any other means, all wet garments should be removed as soon as possible, as they will endanger the health if left to dry upon the body. The feet should be kept dry and warm by having them properly clothed. When rub- ber overshoes or boots are used in wet weather they should be removed from the feet when not needed to keep off the damp- ness, as they are apt to prove an injury to the feet if this is not done. The clothing on one's body should never be too close-fitting or tight, neither in warm nor cold weather. Besides being uncomfortable such clothing is ruinous to health. The shape of the body is naturally graceful, and it cannot be im- proved by any distortions caused by wearing tight-fitting clothes. The clothing of the body should be suspended, as much as possible or practicable from the shoulders. Nothing should be worn that will hinder the free circulation of the blood, or that will crush any of the physical organs out of their proper positions.   particularly. A young person who has not lost his hair needs no artificial covering for that purpose; and the head should be kept bare as much as possisble while indoors. This will help to keep one from becoming bald.   and no one should be afraid of it, since the Lord has ordained that man should earn his bread by the sweat of his brow. It is very seldom that people hurt themselves by too much work. Having too many things to attend to, and worrying over them, or an over-amount of mental work with insufficient physical exercise, is indeed injurious. Persons should seek to regulate their affairs so as to avoid such conditions.   fully attended to as the Lord commanded. This day has been set apart as a day of rest; and it is of vital importance that the body should not be robbed of that rest which it requires. There is nothing that would be of more benefit to our physical and mental organization than a relief once a week from the cares and anxieties of our every-day occupations and studies.   is to be gained by laboring on the Sabbath as well as during the rest of the week. The system requires a certain amount of rest, and if it does not receive it regularly as it should, we will have to yield to its demands sooner or later. If we refuse to give our bodies an opportunity to get renewed vigor by a frequent relaxation from the constant strain upon them, our constitutions will eventually break down; and we will at last be compelled to take time to allow them to gain strength. By going to pleasure resorts, or indulging in sports of different kinds, will not answer any purpose for which the Sabbath was intended. There is more or less excitement attending such recreations, and the mind and body are not so perfectly at rest as when one calmly observes the Sabbath as the Lord intended it should be, and that is by attending public worship, partaking of the sacrament and offering up our praise and thanksgiving to Him, and by seeking to learn such things that are for our spiritual welfare, to be nourished with spiritual food; so that the Sabbath was ordained to be unto man not only a spiritual but a temporal blessing as well. It is apparent that there is a two-fold object in every requirement the Lord makes of His people, and there is also a double blessing attending the obedience to that requirement.

No mere publisher, as a financial venture, could publish 3 such volumes with a limited circulation: the steel plates alone requiring a capital of twenty thousand dollars. But I have been backed with the money and friendship of great generous men; and the steel plates, like my histories, have been the accumulations of years.

The greatest care has been taken to convey the ideas in the prophets style as near as possible; and in no case has the sentiment been varied that I know of; as I heard the most of his discourses myself, was on the most intimate terms with him, have retained a most vivid recollection of his teachings, and was well acquainted with his principles and motives. The History has been compiled to the day of his death, and the principal part of it has been revised by the council of the First Presidency almost without any alteration. A few vacancies remain to be filled up from the statements of persons who are now absent.

After joining the Church he inquired about the law of tithing; and reckoning his outfit, which consisted of his trunk, books, etc., to be worth $50.00, he paid $5.00 as tithing.
