ities of the spirit, I would to God I had less of them. I wish I had been a better man and done more good. But notwithstanding all the imperfections of my nature, I rejoice in God. I am thankful that I live in this day and generation, that I have received the Gospel and the priesthood, and that the Spirit of God is still with me and my companions. The hand of God is before me and visible to my eye in the great work of this last dispensation to all the inhabi- tants of this world. Yea, the God of Israel will teach this nation, with its congress- men and rulers, the governors, judges, and marshals, and all men, that He is stronger than man, that His purposes fail not, that He is able to perform all that He has set His hand to do, and that he will perform it and bring it to pass in spite of earth or hell, or wicked men or devils, and none can stay his hand. In this I rejoice. We have nothing to discourage us, so far as the Church and Kingdom of God are concerned in their final triumph. Of course we are called to mourn for sin and transgression, whether in the church or out of it. This warfare is with God and the Heavenly hosts on one side, ENDENTRY L. D. S. Historian's Office, P. O. BOX 321,  Salt Lake City, Utah, 24 Sep 1886  and the fallen angels and the earth beneath on the other. The devil is ruling over his kingdom and is making a desperate strug- gle to overcome the kingdom of God and its Christ. But they cannot prevail. Here is the patience and faith of the Saints and they that keep the commandments of God and the testimony of Jesus. It certainly is beginning to be a trying time to the Saints of God. But if we had no trials, in our day, of our faith, we would hardly be at home with the ancient Saints, who were persecuted and martyred for the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ. Whatever weakness we may have as pertaining to our flesh, we certainly ought not to be afraid to lay down our lives for the Gospel's sake if required, and I hope and pray that we may all be prepared for whatever afflictions the Lord has ordained us to pass through.  I have been asked a number of times if I could tell where the October Conference would be held.

President Wilford Woodruff,  Dear Brother: For several years I have devoted more or less time to collecting and compiling genealogies, and if it meets your approval, I would like to make arrangements to pros- ecute this work on a more extensive scale than heretofore. My plan is to purchase as many books on the subject of genealogy, or relating thereto, as I can, and in time collect a good library of such works. In connection with this library I would conduct an agency or bureau through which the Saints who might desire to patronize it might obtain the records of their ancestry.  I already have a library of genealogical works which has cost sev- eral hundred dollars, and which comprises a good foundation for such a one as I would like to collect. Brother D. J. Williams of the Fif- teenth Ward, who is my brother-in-law, is interested in the plan with me, and if agreeable to you he will go east shortly to purchase books, and search records for a number of families who desire their ancestry traced.  My own time in^s^ pretty well occupied with my labors on the "News," and it is my desire to at once relieve myself and put the library I have already collected to the best use, by employing him, and perhaps others, to do the work of compiling genealogies which is steadily growing on my hands, and has necessitated my working late evenings, ENDENTRY be long: it was a sore trial to me- being left to stem the tide of advercity with Seven Small children.

Dear Brother,  I take the liberty of wrighting you, according to the advice of Bro Richards to ask you to be so kind as to give me a little counsel. I and my family em- igrated from England to this City one year ago and during that time I have been very unfortunite in obtaining employment.

But somehow every thing seem's to oppose me and against me what ever I undertake to do. ENDENTRY much of the time during the last year. I have applications to do work for many families which I cannot entertain at all, but I think the plan I have suggested would open the way for hundreds of families of Saints to obtain their genealogies.  I have acquired a knowledge of and experience in this work which would enable me to exercise a general supervision over such a library and agency as I have suggested, without occupying much of my time; and while I am very much interested in my work on the "News" and desire that nothing else shall interfere with it, I have felt strongly im- pressed that I ought not to abandon the work of gathering the records of the dead. Indeed, I amm scarcely able to resist the requests that are made of me to trace genealogies, so urgent^ly^ are some of them pre- sented, and so great is my own interest in the work.  Both Brother Williams and myself desire to be governed entirely by your counsel, but if the foregoing suggestions meet your approval, we will proceed at once to carry them out.  Your brother, B. F.

Do you  desire to be baptized for the remission of sins? If so,  seek after a man of God who has been truly called and or- dained unto the authority which God hath again restored by  the ministering of holy angels; and when you have found such  an one who has authority from heaven to baptize, go with  him into the water and he will baptize you in the name of the  Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost; and then  your sins shall be remitted on the earth, and the blessings shall  be sealed in the heavens; and then you shall also be baptized  with fire and the Holy Ghost.  ORSON PRATT, Tract on Water Baptism, p. 48.  A Saul might hear the voice of the Lord from heaven ##Acts 9:3-6## or a  Cornelius be blessed with the ministration of a holy angel; ##Acts 10:1-7## but,  though they had been thus favored, to fulfill and comply with  all the requirements of the Lord, it was necessary for them to  be baptized to obtain remission of sins, that they might become the recipients of the Holy Ghost through the ordinance of the laying on of hands, and be enabled to walk in newness of life.  If they had not complied with this requirement, they would  not have been in a suitable condition to have entered into the  kingdom of God.  GEO. Q. CANNON, Western Standard p. 162.  We want to sacrifice enough to do the will of God in prepar- ing to bring up those who have not had the privilege of hear- ing the gospel while in the flesh, for the simple reason that, in  the spirit world, they cannot officiate in the ordinances of the  house of God. They have passed the ordeals, and are beyond  the possibility of personally officiating for the remission of  their sins and for their exaltation, consequently they are under  the necessity of trusting in their friends, their children and  their children's children to officiate for them, that they may  be brought up into the celestial kingdom of God.  BRIGHAM YOUNG, Journal of Discourses, vol. xviii. p. 238.  It is not in the power of any man or angel to find a license  in the Bible to receive a person into the kingdom of God with-  out baptism. Jesus Christ has never given any license, but on  the other hand, He has explicitly said, in the most unequivo- cal language possible, that NO MAN can "enter the kingdom"  without water baptism, or being "born of the water." ##John 3:5##  ORSON SPENCER, Spencer's Letters, p 50.  The conditions of salvation from death, hell and the grave,  are faith in God, in Jesus Christ, and in the atonement; re- pentance, reformation, and a godly life; baptism by immer- sion for the remission of sins administered by divine authority,  the sanctifying effects of the blood of Christ that follows the  water, and the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of  hands by properly ordained ministers. These conditions are  as essential to salvation in the kingdom of heaven to-day, as  they were in the days when Christ and His apostles and elders  declared them nearly nineteen hundred years ago. The same  authority has been restored to the earth. The same apostle- ship and keys of priesthood, with power to officiate in the  ordinances of the house of God, are again restored to earth,  and the gospel of God is being preached in all nations for a  witness. The same signs follow the believers according to  their faith, obedience, and the will of God. The same unction  from the Holy One is enjoyed by the Saints, and gives them  a living testimony that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, and  Joseph Smith His servant, ordained to usher in the dispensa- tion of the fullness of times. God has revealed these precious  truths to the Elders and Saints of the Church of Jesus Christ  of Latter-day Saints, and they know they are living in the last  days. Consequently He requires His people whom He hath  redeemed, and unto whom He hath made the Scriptures plain,  to live perfect lives, and to do His will on earth as it is done  in heaven.  B. H. ROBERTS, Mill. Star, vol. 1. p. 296.  Many have looked upon baptism as merely "an outward  sign of an inward grace;" but this is one of the uninspired  precepts of man, and is not a Bible doctrine; instead of bap- tism's being the "sign of an inward grace," it is the ordinance  through which the believing penitent obtains a remission of  sins which justifies and prepares the heart for the reception  "of an inward grace." Remission of sins, and "an inward  grace," do not precede baptism, but follow it.  The numerous multitudes that came to John were not bap- tized in Jordan, because they had previously received forgive- ness and "an inward grace;" but they came confessing their  sins and were baptized for the remission of them. ##Mark 1:4-5##  ORSON PRATT, Tract on Water Baptism, p. 43.  Jesus told Nicodemus that "except a man be born of water,  and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God." ##John 3:5## An entrance into the kingdom of God, then, cannot be obtained  by a man who has not been born of water and of the Spirit.  Neither sincerity nor morality will avail, except these essential  ordinances have been attended to. Though the Lord is full of  mercy and love for His creatures, yet His justice and truth  would not permit so flagrant a violation of His laws, as the  neglect of these ordinances would be, to pass unpunished;  much less would He break His own word, where He says  that the man who does not attend to these requirements can- not enter into His kingdom, by admitting them therein.  GEO. Q. CANNON, Western Standard p. 403.  The necessity of baptism must be understood. It is taught  by some that the observance of this ordinance is optional on  the part of the candidate for celestial glory. This is danger- ous doctrine. There is no authority for it in the scriptures.  Jesus and His apostles never taught it. It is contrary to their  teachings. Jesus never included a non-essential principle in  the great plan of salvation. Had not baptism been necessary,  He would not have said to His apostles: "He that believeth  and is baptized shall be saved." ##Mark 16:16##  WM. JEFFERIES,  Tract, "The Gospel Pioneer," p. 15.  Whatever an over-jealous mind may fear concerning the  state of the penitent thief on the cross, and of devout and  upright men that have lived and died in every age of the  world, still let God's word be accounted true, and every man  that gainsays it be esteemed a liar! No man ever put on the  uniform of Christ's followers, such as is worn by subjects of  the kingdom of Christ, until he is "baptized into Christ" for  the remission of sins. Hereby he "puts on Christ." ##Romans 13:14##  ORSON SPENCER, Spencer's Letters, p. 49.

CHAPTER VI—DAILY OCCUPATIONS.  PEOPLE are employed in so many different branches of labor, and occupy their time in such various ways that only a few suggestions which will apply to them generally will be given here.  If one's occupation causes him to perspire, or "sweat" freely he should be careful to not cool his body too suddenly by going from a warm room to a cold place, and there remain- ing till his body is chilled. He should also use caution in drinking cold water. When a person is warm and thirsty he is very liable to drink too much at a time. Ice-water in warm weather is not the proper drink for anyone, and should not be used if avoidable.  During the daytime one should try and make it convenient to stand up part of the time and sit down another part. Too much sitting or standing is likely to be injurious. While sit- ting, standing or walking, keep the body erect, with the shoul- ders thrown back, so the lungs will not be cramped, and to prevent consumption.  A beauty of nature is that the more graceful one's actions are the more they tend to health and comfort. By keeping the body upright, by closing the mouth when not in use, by avoiding too much boistersous laughter, by appearing cheerful, pleasant and good-natured, and by keeping our temper we can enjoy better health than we can otherwise; so that the rules of deportment which are calculated to make us agreeable to our associates will also often prove good to preserve health.  If during the day, especially in cold seasons, you should happen to get your clothing dampened through being exposed in a rainstorm or by any other means, all wet garments should be removed as soon as possible, as they will endanger the health if left to dry upon the body. The feet should be kept dry and warm by having them properly clothed. When rub- ber overshoes or boots are used in wet weather they should be removed from the feet when not needed to keep off the damp- ness, as they are apt to prove an injury to the feet if this is not done. The clothing on one's body should never be too close-fitting or tight, neither in warm nor cold weather. Besides being uncomfortable such clothing is ruinous to health. The shape of the body is naturally graceful, and it cannot be im- proved by any distortions caused by wearing tight-fitting clothes. The clothing of the body should be suspended, as much as possible or practicable from the shoulders. Nothing should be worn that will hinder the free circulation of the blood, or that will crush any of the physical organs out of their proper positions.  The covering for the head should not be for keeping it warm particularly. A young person who has not lost his hair needs no artificial covering for that purpose; and the head should be kept bare as much as possisble while indoors. This will help to keep one from becoming bald.  A reasonable amount of hard labor is beneficial to health; and no one should be afraid of it, since the Lord has ordained that man should earn his bread by the sweat of his brow. It is very seldom that people hurt themselves by too much work. Having too many things to attend to, and worrying over them, or an over-amount of mental work with insufficient physical exercise, is indeed injurious. Persons should seek to regulate their affairs so as to avoid such conditions.  The proper observance of the Sabbath day should be care- fully attended to as the Lord commanded. This day has been set apart as a day of rest; and it is of vital importance that the body should not be robbed of that rest which it requires. There is nothing that would be of more benefit to our physical and mental organization than a relief once a week from the cares and anxieties of our every-day occupations and studies.  No one should deceive himself with the idea that anything is to be gained by laboring on the Sabbath as well as during the rest of the week. The system requires a certain amount of rest, and if it does not receive it regularly as it should, we will have to yield to its demands sooner or later. If we refuse to give our bodies an opportunity to get renewed vigor by a frequent relaxation from the constant strain upon them, our constitutions will eventually break down; and we will at last be compelled to take time to allow them to gain strength. By going to pleasure resorts, or indulging in sports of different kinds, will not answer any purpose for which the Sabbath was intended. There is more or less excitement attending such recreations, and the mind and body are not so perfectly at rest as when one calmly observes the Sabbath as the Lord intended it should be, and that is by attending public worship, partaking of the sacrament and offering up our praise and thanksgiving to Him, and by seeking to learn such things that are for our spiritual welfare, to be nourished with spiritual food; so that the Sabbath was ordained to be unto man not only a spiritual but a temporal blessing as well. It is apparent that there is a two-fold object in every requirement the Lord makes of His people, and there is also a double blessing attending the obedience to that requirement.  THE TWO SIDES.

To-morrow is Fast day; we will fast and pray, and ask God to enable us to cast this gloom away; and when we have accomplished it, try to always look on the bright side, for we have had enough of the dark one.

To the most venerable President Wilford Woodruff Salt-Lake-City.  Dear President and Brother! Through the grace of our Lord and Saviour Jesus the Christ, I have, in obedience to your call, been permitted to finish the translation of the holy book of Mormon into the Jewish language.  How far I have succeded in making the transla- tion a correct one, it is not for me to say, but others familiar with the language of the Jews will decide upon. I feel that I have been aboundantly blessed by the holy Ghost, while engaged in perfor- ming this glorios Work, and in my humble judge- ment I believe and declare it to be verbally cor- rect according to the reading in the english book, and I know that I am justified in saying, that it sounds even sweeter in the language of the Jews, then in any other language with which I am familiar and into which the book has yet been translated.  It has been a Work of love to me, and I never set down to do it witout invoking the assistance of the Spirit of the most high God, and today I am happy to bear testimony that the Lord, the God of my fathers Jacob, has accepted of my prayers and blessed me in my Work.

President Wilford Woodruff,  Dear Brother:  Your communi- cation of Aug. 8th 1888, was received and most carefully read over and perused by me. In answer, I can say that, with what little experience I have gained, I realize, to a certain extent, that in or- der for the Lord's purposes to be brought about, missionaries must be sent from Zion to preach the Gospel to all nations and, in as much as you think me wor- thy to be honored with this very im- portant call; and have chosen me, with others, to carry the Gospel ^to^ the Samoan Islands, I cheerfully accept the call; for I know that it is my duty to respond to any call made by those in authority, and with the help of my Father in Heaven I will be ready and start with my brethern from San Francisco on Thurs: Sept. 20th 1888.  It is my earnest desire that, in my humble way, I may be able with my brethern to perform a successful mission in the sight of the Lord.  Your Brother in the Gospel, Edw. J Wood. ENDENTRY E.

Belva Lockwood was very much prejudiced, when I first met her, gradually this wore away, and the next year after my return to Utah, she wrote me a letter saying "Get a petition signed by some of your most influential women in protesting against the Suffrage being taken from  you, and I will see that it is not thrown under the table". I took it to a meeting in the 14th Ward, and asked the privilege of reading it.

But there is another and most wonderfull sign, which ought to atract your consideration dear President Woodruff, and which no doubt, will fill your heart with joy and gratitude to our God, and it is this: No sooner did you command the translation of the book into the Jewish tongue, and no sooner did our messengers the Elders of Israel arrive in the holy land, then the Lord moved upon the Emperor and ruler over the land of Turkey, to revoke an Ukas, or a law, which dates more the 900 years bak, and to permit the Jews to return bak into the land of their fathers, ye the land ENDENTRY sideways text Ed J.

To President Wilford Woodruff and Quorum and the Presiding Bishops  Dear Brethren, I address you relative to the second volume of Tullidge's Histories of Utah, which is a companion volume of the History of Salt Lake City. The book will contain the history of all the Northern Counties of Utah and also of Southern Idaho, as well as of Western and Eastern Utah— Box Elder, Rich and Southern Idaho.  Nearly all these counties with their cities are written up, and two thirds of the book in print, and three thousand dollars worth of steel plates have been engraved for this vol. and are waiting the issue. There are Father Thatcher, Peter Maughan, Judge Wm Hyde, Bishop S. Mollen, Jonathan Browning, John Sharp, the Banker Guthrie, the miners of the Park, R. C. Chambers and John Daily, and others, merchants and capitalists of James H. Hart who designs to send their portraits immediately to my engravers, probably brother Nibbly; also I think others of the railroad chiefs besides John Sharp.  The second volume is divided into two parts—namely the general history of the Counties, occupying 600 pages, and suplemental mental part (or vol) 300 or 600 pages say, most of the latter being in print.

Elder Izodal writing from Jerusalem says: "the ga- thering of the Jews is no more a matter of believe but an established fact which I see hearre every day."  This movement did not begenn, not untill President Woodruff, our Prophet and Seer and Revelater said in his letter to me dated 23d of April A. D. 1888: "your labors in this connection is the translation of the book of Mormon into the Jewish language, it being of great value to the Jewish race, and in the line of fulfilling the  predictions of the book itself," and in which you will be greatly aided by the Spirit of the Lord"  What a wounderfull prophecy and how literaly its fulfilling is at hand!  Yes, I have been mercyfull aided by the Spirit of the Lord during the year past, and as I am about to submite the book in the language of my peuple, to you, I can not withold my burning desire to ask of you, that it may please you, to consider how my Way could in the future be opened before me, that I may go back to my peuple, as it is ENDENTRY Richard Ballantyne, James H. Hart an Eldridge^ and others of their class, so that this book of biographies (or supplement) will embody a vast amount of the history ofthe Church, our foreign missions, our emigration and pioneer work besides the building up of the cities and counties of Utah.  This second vol of my Histories of Utah is nearly complete, but I am unable to finish it without help. Mr Cannon needs money of me to purchase paper for the remaining part. I have to acknow- ledge that Cannon and Sons have generously carried much of my burden. Moses Thatcher has also greatly helped me. Besides steel plates, he at one time gave me three hundred dollars, and at another time loaned me $300, which I still owe him, Lorenzo and further help from the Thatcher family and Bishop Preston. Lorenzo Snow has also helped me personally with $100, and also urged his County to help me. Indeed, it is from such personal help, from these and numerous others, that I have been enabled to prosecute my costly work so far, rather than from appropriations from Cities or Counties.  Ogden City at the onset appropriated $1000, but an injunction was put on it. Some of the citizens then agreed to raise $1000, but only six hundred were raised, mostly by the members of the City Council and a few of the Ogden merchants, which, however, I returned to them in personal service and printers bills on their biographies and commercial interests; so that it was no appropriation in any sense. As for Weber County, though it leads and claims the book, it has refused repeatedly to help its own history, though ^notwithstanding^ my brother Franklin has been solicitous for that help in my behalf. Altogether from these County and City appropriations, I have received about $2300, while the work has covered two years and half of labor of myself and two assistants—Joseph Hall and James A.

Again I say that I have been much blessed during the year past in which day by day I have been en- gaged in my holy Work; I have also derived much blessings from the associations with the Saints, worship- ping with them our God the most High Jehovah, where the Spirit from on high has often been poured out upon me in the congregations of the Saints; I have also been blessed with a faithfull and noble daughter in Israel which the Lord gave me for a helpmate to strengthen my faith, and for which I am thankfull by day and by night to Him, who is the giver of all good gifts; but on the other hand the Lord was also willing to deprive me of the privileges of His holy house, and I can see now that your counsel concerning the holy house, given  to me a few months ago, was just and right, be- cause it helped me to think more deep over the holiness connected with the great institutions and covenants of the Lord's Temple; Today how- ever I can not but mention to you the following circumstances: My dear Wife has been born and raised in the covenant and has been allways faithfull in doing her duties as a L.

For a year and a quarter I had Bro Joseph Hall engaged at $100 per month, and all travelling and hotel expenses he are ^paid;^ and Elder James A. Little seven months at $75 and expenses. They were constantly from home traveling, collecting history and obtaining biographical matter, while I myself have been out most of the time of the last two and half years on this same work; which, giving me even a small wage to support my family, and my expenses, apart from officers at home, ^this^ will show that I have spent from $5000 to 7000 in making this book, which was ^has been^ far more costly and laborious to make than the History of Salt Lake City; as that ^book^ was a growth of years in my own hands ^and^ which was produced in my own closet; and Moreover I had a committee to help me in every way and to petition for me for extension of time and further appropriations: to that Committee—Col. Winder, Gen George A Meears, and Judge Jonasen I owe much, while on this Northern History I have had no such help, excepting in the personal help of those already named.  To the cost of making this book as shown above there must be added the printers and binders and engravers bills (2000 vols of 1000 pages), giving a total of from ten to fiften thousand dollars.  Had I know at the onset that the Northern cities and counties would not have given me generous help by appropriations, following the example of Salt Lake City, I would never have undertaken the work, for I knew by experience something of the labor and cost of making large volumes of histories of a young nation, like our modern Israel with his colonizations all over this western country, the record of which had to be gathered and constructed into form.

But, being anxious to write the history of Utah in the interest of the Mormon people, I started with this Northern Volume, designing next a Southern Volume; and so, with three volumes, magne brought up to date, magnificently illustrated with $20,000 of steel plates of the men who founded this Territory, Utah would have a published history not unworthy to live. No mere publisher, as a financial venture, could publish 3 such volumes with a limited circulation: the steel plates alone requiring a capital of twenty thousand dollars. But I have been backed with the money and friendship of great generous men; and the steel plates, like my histories, have been the accumulations of years. I scarcely need tell you this, as the money of President Lorenzo Snow, Wm B. Preston and many others of your own class, with Hooper Eldredge, and monied men of the Gentiles have so greatly helped me in my work.  This work of writing these histories of Utah and the Mormon people has not been, with Edward Tullidege, a mere author's effort for fame and bread, nor a publisher's speculation. It has been regarded by me from the onset—  even before Franklin Richards called me to the Millennial Star Office thirty three years ago—as the work and mission of my life, to help to create for the Mormon people a worthy national literature, of a semi-Hebraic type, corresponding with the genius and history of our people.

During the last fourteen years, since I commence the Life of Brigham Young, a strange Providence has attended my publishing, and from fifty to seventy-five thousand dollars have been put into my publishing work; and yet when I went to Brigham Young and told him I was going to write and publish his Life I had not a dollar, nor scarcely food or fire in my house. The same Providence will still attend my work and put me through, but how that Providence will manifest itself I wait to discover.  I come now, Brethren, to the help for which I appeal to you. I need $500 to complete my Northern volume; $300 payable to George Q. Cannon and Sons to purchase paper to complete the book, a draft of $100 in favor of my engravers, H. B. Halls Sons, and $100 for me to work on the book. For this $500 Mr Cannon will, on its publication deliver to the Bishop's Office or the President's Office one hundred and twenty-five volumes of this said History.

These were sent to the best journals, libraries, universities and leading men of the nation. Thus has the History of Salt Lake City become a standard work in both England and America, in libraries and places where they will do good service to Utah and the Mormon people.  Acknowledgements of the gift of the City and newspaper notices came often to the Mayor and the Author and doubtless to the President's Office. I enclose you some addressed to me to Box B. I have since learned indirectly that this is the President's Box. Could I have seen the President I should have shown him these and asked permission to retain them, as they were addressed to the Author, and to him and his children they will be as testmonials. They will show you that your gifts have been acknowledged by the Universities of America and also of Cambridge, England.  I trust, Brethren, you will aid me by this advance of $500 for 125 volumes for distribution, which I believe will be as bread cast upon the waters. This will not only enable me to complete my book, but financially recover me in the Spring and Summer; for I shall not only have 2000 vols of this book, but I have 1400 vols of the History of Salt Lake City, unbound, which (adding a chapter to bring it up to date) I should, as soon ^as^ means are produced by the new vol, bind up and put on the market as Second Edition of the History of Salt Lake City. It would be a pity for me to die as Historian and Publisher, with from ten to twenty thousand dollars worth of good property on my hands, and yet though saleable it is just such property and in such condition that the Banks would not advance money on.  Hoping you brethren of the Twelve and Presiding Bishops will help me, I remain, Your Servant and Brother Edw. W. Tullidge. ENDENTRY Letter from Geo. A. Smith, dated April 21, 1856. To Wilford Woodruff, Secretary of the Twelve Apostles.  Sir, On the 10th April 1854, I commenced to perform the duties of Historian by taking up the History of Joseph Smith where Dr. Nauvoo on the 4th day of Febuary 1846. I had to revise and compare two years of back history which he had compiled, filling up numerous spaces which had been marked as omissions ^on memoranda^ by Dr. Richards.  I commenced compiling the history of Joseph Smith from April 1st 1840 to his death on June 27th 1844. I have filled up all the reports of sermons by President Joseph Smith and others from minutes or sketches taken at the time in long hand by Dr. Willard Richards, Wilford Woodruff, Thomas Bullock, Eliza R. Snow, andc. which was an im- mense labor, requiring the deepest thought and the closest application, as there were mostly only two or three words (about half written) to a sentence. The greatest care has been taken to convey the ideas in the prophets style as near as possible; and in no case has the sentiment been varied that I know of; as I heard the most of his discourses myself, was on the most intimate terms with him, have retained a most vivid recollection of his teachings, and was well acquainted with his principles and motives. The History has been compiled to the day of his death, and the principal part of it has been revised by the council of the First Presidency almost without any alteration. A few vacancies remain to be filled up from the statements of persons who are now absent. The severe application of thought to the principles of the History, the exercise of memory andc. have caused me to suffer much from a nervous headache or inflamation of the brain; and my application of mind being in exercise both day and night, deprived me of a great portion of necessary sleep.  Thomas Bullock acted with me as chief clerk, being a clerk in the History office previously to, and at the time of Prest. Smith's death, and has continued in it ever since. His pen wrote the principal part of the rough manuscript from my dictation, and his acquaintance with all the paper was of great assistance to me.

Leo Hawkins assisted to file papers, copied correspondence, and wrote the final copy of the History in Books C2. and D2 after revision; besides attending the office business generally.  Robert L.

The plan of compiling the history of Joseph Smith from the journals kept by his clerks, William Clayton, Wilford Woodruff, and Thomas Bullock, was commenced by himself, extracting items of necessary information in regard to general and particular movements from the Times and Seasons, Millennial Star, Wasp, Neighbor and other publications, extracts from city councils, Municipal Courts, and Mayor's dock- ets and Legion Records, which were all kept under his direction; also the movements of the church as found in Conference minutes, High Council records, and the records of the several quorums, together with letters and copies preserved on file; also noted remarkable accurrences throughout the world, and compiled them under date of transaction, according to the above plan which he while in prison just previous to his murder re- quested Elder Willard Richards to continue; which trust Elder Richards fulfilled as far as he could while he lived, and would have completed it had not the mob violence to which he was subjected prevented him. I assisted Dr. Richards during about 70 days in revising and col- lecting matter for the History while in Nauvoo, which made me acquainted with his plan of compilation, which I have pursued as near as possible, con sidering the different circumstances; and I am positive that no history could be more absolutely correct in its statements, as the genuineness of every statement admitted into it is unquestionable.  There have been kept under my superintendence; an office Jour- nal, containing a general sketch of the transactions of the Presidency and the church at the present time; a book of Incidents of History, containing Conference minutes, Reports andc. and a Book of Obituary notices.

A large amount of testimony has also been written from the verbal statements of individuals, which was afterwards embodied in the Manu- script of the History; also affidavits taken for the same purpose.  The proof and revise of the History in the Deseret News have been read in my office. I have also assisted in conducting the news when the Editor was sick or absent.  I also got up a synopsis of the History for the Peoples Journal by Prest. B. Young's request.  There have been 878 pages, averaging 700 words to a page, written in the large History books, there are 600 pages ready to be copied from the first books to the second, and there is manuscript now compiled which it is estimated will fill upwards of 400 pages in each set of books.  I have attended two sessions of the Legislative Assembly while the above was going on, and my clerks were the clerks of the Legis- lature during their sitting.  I have three times visited Iron County which I represented in the Legislative Council, and with my clerks made the compilation of the Laws of Utah in 1855. I have preached on Sabbath days, and at other times, in different parts of the counties of Great Salt Lake, Provo and other parts of Utah County sixteen times, and have acted as President when there; and by the direction of Prest. B. Young, I have married several hundred couples under the law of sealing in that county and south of it, during the above visits, and have carefully reported every one of them to the General recorder of marriages. I have also kept up a continual correspondence with the News, giving a general outline of the local news, and history of the progress of the different towns and settlements I have visited.  During the month of November 1855 I was confined to my room by sickness caused by too close application to business since I was ap- pointed Historian; during which time I have not spent twenty days exclusively to my individual business.

He came here from Utah on his way to that place. While there he came across the Voice of Warning, and was so impressed with it that he determined to investigate Mormonism the next time he came this way. -He is naturally of a roving disposition: although he had arrived in California he had no intention of remaining there.- He came here from Oregon; and one of the first things he did was to visit the Museum wrere he found Brother Schofield, through whom, after five consecutive days talk, he was converted to our faith. After joining the Church he inquired about the law of tithing; and reckoning his outfit, which consisted of his trunk, books, etc., to be worth $50.00, he paid $5.00 as tithing. He worked along the most part of the time earning from 12 to 15 dollars per month, until he obtained the position he now occupies at re-baptized once, having indulged in drink.
