 May 1, 1847 ~ Saturday      May 1st 1847 [FIGURE] This was an interesting day   to the hunters of the Camp of   Israel. It was vary cold Ther stood   at 30° with strong North wind  the hunters put out & the camp   started on the Journey. Before breakfast travled 6 miles   & camped on the Prairie in sight of a herd of buffalo of   200 feeding on the bluff to our right. three ownly of the   hunters started out after them they rode near them &   left their horses & cralled upon them to get a shot but they   frightend the herd & they run away. A little previous to the  main herds being seen 3 bulls were discoverd on the   bluff O. P. Rockwell & two others went after them &   wounded two but got neither of them we had not   travled more than 2 miles before we discoverd another   large herd of about 200, 5 miles ahead of us the hunters   got together held a council & waited untill the camp all   came up we were determined to get some of the buffalo   if possible we travled together untill we were within one mile   of the buffalo we then made a halt, & 15 hunters started out  Amasa Lyman & myself of the Twelve made two of the numb  ber we all travled together on to the bluffs within a few rods   of them & there divided out into companies Br Grover &   Luke Johnson went together into the bluffs O. P. Rockwell   & Br Brown took the entire left & so we divided into compa-  nies on the right left & center I was in a company in the   centre of the herd & we all made a charge upon them from   the bluffs & rushed on to the Plain, the herd run vary fast   down the ruff bluffs into the plain but when we came up to   the plain we soon came on to them each company singled   out his game we made choice of Cows generally then rushed   up by the side of them & fired upon them with our Pistols   such as horse Pistols Rifle Pistols &c which are much better   to carry than rifles as they are vary cumberson in runing the first   that we gave chase to was a Buffaloo Cow with her calf I   rode by the side of her & fired two balls from my Pistols   into her. the other Brethren with me also fired into her   untill we killed we cut her throat I then run my   horse to the assistance of another Party who had wounded   one & that one was also soon dispatched. I then saw   O. P. Rockwell. had 3 bulls at bay on the Prairie Br Pack &   myself run our horses to his assistance & Br Kimball came up at   the same time we surrounded them & commenced firing   upon them they bolted ahead I put spirs to my horse   & run in ahead of them was in about one rod of them   they all Pitched at ^me^ & gave me chase for fight & I had to  be quick to get out of their way but soon cleared them   two of them broke for the bluff Br Brown put for them  Rockwell, Kimball, Pack & myself stuck to the old bull I   fired 2 balls into him, Br Kimball one, Br Pack one & he fell   dead, & we cut his throat, & also shot a clalf that was   with him, the two that had left us that Brown was   after was in the bluffs more than a mile from us Br   Kimball & myself gave chase to them & as we got in   about 20 rods of the bluff we saw two come out &   run for the main herd we gave chase for a while   but they were fresh & my horse had run near 10 miles     
 in the chase so we gave up the persuit I returned to Br Brown   in the bluffs & found that one of the bulls he had given chase to   was near dead had lain dead down but Br Brown had no more   Powder or Ball but before I arived he had got up & run   into the herd on the bluff, so we all returned on our chase   ground to gather up the meat, we had killed in all 3 cows one   bull & 5 calves making 11 in all. Br Solomon Hancock went   out in the morning on to the bluffs to kill buffalo on foot  He did not come in at night we felt concerned about him  early in the morning he came in, had killed a 3 year old cow  & watched it over night to keep the volves from eating it   3 wolves came upon him he shot one the rest run   away this made 12 buffalo in all that the hunters   killed to day which we considered was doing vary well   considering that we were nearly all strangers to that mode   of hunting as but vary few of us ever saw a wild   buffalo before in our lives we dressed out meat & waggons   came from camp to take it in. A part of this chase was   through one of the largest Prairie dog towns nearly ever   seen it was nearly ten miles long & 2 wide & full of   burrows nearly evry rod & great danger of a horse steping  into them & falling, there was no accident happened   at all to any one which was truly a blessing my horse stumbled  on[c]e & come nigh falling but no harm done this was   the first buffalo hunt I ever took part in or saw  we travled to day with the camp 18 miles  we discovered Indian fires on the south & west of us      May 2, 1847 ~ Sunday      2nd Suunday All were busy cooking & saving there meat  in the afternoon we moved up 3 miles for better feed &   camped by the side of a large slew of water our camping   place last night & this morning was at the head of Grand Island  Professor Pratt took an observation for the Lattitude & found   it to be 40° 41' 42" this agrees with Freemonts obervation   within 2 miles & his was on the south side of the river which   was 2 miles south of our camping place we came through another   large dog town to day, soon after we camped a herd of   buffalo came from the bluffs to the river to drink   within about 2 miles of us & then returned to the bluffs  some were anxious to go after them, but as it was   Sunday Br Young thought it best to let them be   untill tomorrow the Indians set fire to the Prairie   before us which burnt rapedly over a large region of   country Brs Young Kimball & several others went   several miles in the evening on our road to examine   the fire & other things. distance 3 miles      May 3, 1847 ~ Monday      3rd The hunters were called together in the morning   20 in number to go into the bluffs for a still hunt for   bluffs buffalo & other game we started out with   two waggons to bring in the game I had taken a   severe cold & setled in my side whare I was hurt   last fall & it made me sick & I was not able   to go out yet I started with the company as I   was among the hunters I had Jar[r]ed myself     
 badly in my hard buffalo chase on Saturday & I now   was feeling its effects at the same time the hunters   started. Another company was formed to go & explore out   the rout & see if we could get grass for our horses as the   Indians had been burning it up for several days. We went   into the bluffs & seperated into two Parties 10 in each   & we travled some 10 miles back & & forth over the hills  & saw no game except antelope & wolvesNo I felt so   unwell I concluded to go back to camp. A Lyman &   3 others were with me. we set down upon the edge  of the bluff in sight of the camp to rest ourselves & we   saw a company of 20 horsman approaching ^us^ from the  camp in haste bearing a red flag when they got within   half a mile of us we trailed our arms & went down  to meet them. they informed us that the party that   went up the river had come upon an encampment   of about 400 Indian warriors. A party of about 100   had followed them down a ravene to cut off their   retreat probably with the Intention of rob[b]ing them  of their horses & clothing & would take life if they could  not do it with out & this company of horsman   had come to us to call in the hunters to camp so   we went in the hunters in coming in with the  horsman came across a herd of buffalo & brought  into camp 3 calf, & 4 antelope they kept out a good  guard during the night & we had no disturbance the   cannon was fired twice early in the morning to let   the Indians know we were awake. I had a vary   severe night with my side was in much pain we  had some ^a great^ dew & frost during the night. 12      May 4, 1847 ~ Tuesday      4th Thermometer stands at 33° this morning I feel  some better than I did last night we started on  our journey this morning 5 waggons a breast which made   5 roads this was to be in readiness in case of an attack from   the Indians we travled 3 miles & saw some waggons on the  opposite side of the river. going down the Platt soon one of the   men waded the Platt & came to us, to see who we were. He info-  rmed us they were traders from fort Laramee he had been   there 3 years had not tasted bread for 2 years, was 16 days from  Laramee the grass was green & good on the south side to that  fort but burnt of on the North side He waided the Platt to  come to us a mile across it & did not go but little above his   knees He would take letters to us to Sarpee who lived near   winter Quarters so the campe stoped & wrote 52 letters to   our familys I was ahead of the company with O Pratt taking  observations & did not know untill the time was nearly up  I then in great haste scribbled a few lines to my wife An epistle   was written to the Church &c. Three Brethren accompanied the   Frenchman accross the Platt to the other men was 9 in all  had not seen an Indian since they left Laramee, stated their  was a ferry at the fort &c agreed to take our letters safe  we drove on 3 miles more & bated our teams untill the Brethren   returned they made a report to the camp of what was   said to them a Council of the whole camp was then called   to deside whether we would cross the Platt or continue up     
 the North side of it we were convinced that it wood   be better for us as a company to cross the river on [illegible] take the  old travled road to Laramee as their was good grass on   the way on that side while the Indians were burning   it all off on the North side of the river where we were   travling but when we took into consideration the   situation of the next company & thousands that would   follow after & as we were the Pioneers & had not our   wives & children with us we thought it best to keep on   the north side of the river & brave the difficulties of   burning Prairies & make a road that should stand as   a permanant rout for the Saints indipendant of the   old emigration rout & let the river seperate the emigrating   companies that they need not quarrel for wood grass   or water & when our next company came along the grass   would be much better for them than it would on the  south side as it would grow up by the time they would get   along. A vote was called & it was unanimous to go on   the north side of the river. So the camp again moved   on, but during the nooning Col Markham drilled the men   in a military capacity, they unshiped the cannon & carried  it on wheels, the Frenchman informed us that he never   saw so many buffalo [on] on the rout this year they had to   stop several times to let the herd pass so they could get   along, we saw many deer & antelope to day & also wolves   and a few buffalo one large bull came across the  river to us, we rode onto the bank before him & he run   clear back again upon a loap & again crossed below us  we camped at night at a gravel creek or slew a large   herd of buffalo lay but a short distance before us  we travled in all to day 9 m 9 miles      May 5, 1847 ~ Wednesay      5th I was quite sick with the diaree the change from   salt to fresh meat is affecting a number in camp  The 400 Indian warriors that was supposed to be seen   on the 3rd proved to be fals the man was frightened   at a herd of antelope & supposed them to be Indians  we had to keep a guard out this morning to keep  a herd of buffalo from mixing up with our cattle  we have had vary strong south wind for 2 days,  two buffalo bulls at noon were approaching the   herd of cows & men went out & drove them off   we rode up within 3 rods of one that was asleep &  stoped & looked at him for some minutes he awoke &   shook himself & loaped off we met a large herd  in the afternoon the Brethren killed one cow  5 calves & brought a bull calf into camp a live  with the intention of raising it, it would drink   water out of a pail they had some sport in triying  to make it suckle a cow it would try hard to bunt   the men & dogs over & some got hard raps I have   been obliged to keep my bed a part of the day have  suffered much with bowel complaint, when we   stoped for night we soon found ourselves in  the midst of grass on fire & had to return back     
 one mile & camped on a spot of ground on the bank   of the river that was just burned over & no feed   except small patches some took there horses on an  Island near & cut down cotton wood for them  we travled to day 15 miles      May 6, 1847 ~ Thursday      6th I was some better this morning we had some rain last   night I had a poor nights rest. we started early this   morning without feeding (except a little corn) as there was  no grass & travled 3 miles & got beyond the fire left it in our   rear & stop to bait & breakfast on a good spot of grass, this   morning the herds of buffalo speck the plains on both sides   of the river and antelope in great abundance some of   which run into camp, the buffalo calf is dead this morning  that was brought into camp alive last night we continued  our journey saw many herds of buffalo antelope & one large   herd of elk a young buffalo clalf came into camp & followed  us we gave him some milk & left him we travled 10 miles   & nooned on the prairie. we scarsly meet with any timber   now, two antelope were killed this forenoon but as we have   so much meet in camp it is thought best not to kill any more  buffalo untill we need it or any other game. we were visited at  noon with many buffalo Dr Richards G. A. Smith & myself walked  up quite near several buffalo herds & exhamined them through   our glasses they were sheding their coats one bull had a mat   of wool swining by his side, like a loose robe, our herd of   cows started to run among the buffalo & President Young   run his horse to seperate them & had great difficulty in doing it  He lost a spy glass in the chase worth $40, the Brethren  hunted for it a long time but could not find it we  continued to journey among the herds of buffalo & we   are not out of sight of them at all they have eat the   grass out to such a degree that our cattle & horses can   get but vary little to eat we camped near a herd at   night that reached as far as our eyes could extend  there were thousands in it distance of the day 20 m      May 7, 1847 ~ Friday      7th A meeting was called one of the herdsman recieved   a sharp reproof for neglecting the cows yesterday a teem  was called for to take the canon we had an exceding   cold north wind to day we travled 6 miles & camped upon  the bank of the river I should judge we saw 10,000  buffalo to day we came near large herds with a greater propor  tion than usual of calves, yearlings & two year olds we saw   several large ones mired, dead, wolves had commenced eating   some of them we could see wolves upon evry hand   following the herds of buffalo to eat those who die of  wounds, accident or poverty. we had some rain in the   evening. President Young & others rode out in the 6 mile  evening to search out the road a few miles forward &   for the first time on the journey saw & killed a polecat or   skunk. The Rigment was called out in the evening & drilled  Arms inspected &c & found in good order. It was supposed an   Indian was seen crossing the river in the night but was stoped &   did not get ashore     
 May 8, 1847 ~ Saturday      8th A plesant morning. not so cold & winday as yesterday  we did not start untill 10 oclok as our teams wanted rest   as they could not get much as the buffalo had eat all the feed up  Br Wm Clayton prepared a mile gage on his hind waggon   wheel to know how far we travel, I rode forward to day with   the Twelve & others & of all the sights of buffalo that our eyes   beheld was enough to asstonish man thousands upon thousands   would crould together as they came from the bluffs to the   bottom land to go to the river & slues to drink untill the river  & land upon both sides of it was one dark spectacle of moving   objects it looked as though the face of the [e]arth was alive &   moving like the waves of the sea. Br Kimball remarked  that he had herd many buffalo tales told but he never expe-  cted to behold what his eyes now saw the half had not been   told him we saw many dead scattered about & many   wolves following the herds, when we stoped at noon many of   them walked along by the side of our waggons so that   we might easily have shot them down, O P Rockwell did   shoot one through the neck & she droped dead it was a   two year old heifer & good meet there were a great num[ber]   of calves & young cattle in the herds we saw to day we saw   had great difficulty in keeping our cattle & horses from going   among them for if they once get mixed with a herd   it is almost impossible to ever get them again. we   travled to day untill we came to the bluffs that made   down to the river & camped for the night distance 11 1/4 mi      I went onto the top of the highest bluffs that were near   us & took a survey of the surrounding country with our   glasses there being present B. Young H. C. Kimball W Woodruf[f]   & G A Smith the whole sourrounding country north east & west   as far as our vision could extend looked as rough as the sea   in a storm of ridges & valleys of mostly sand with scarcely   any green thing upon it except a little scattering grass &   the Spanish soap root such as the mexicans use for washing   with instead of soap the top resembles a pine apple the   most of any thing I ever saw I brought in one root 24   24 inch long 2 inch in diameter I pounded a little of it up   & it would fill a dish with suds like soap      May 9, 1847 ~ Sunday      9th Sunday As we had no feed around us we took up   [FIGURES] our teams & passed across the bluffs   4 miles & camped for the day I wrote 2 letters one to   Br Ferguson & the other to Br Bevin for Br Wolley to   take with him to Purbelo we had a meeting & a good   one the spirit of God rules over the camp. Peace quietn[ess]   & contentment seems to pervade almost evry breast. the   Twelve met & thought it best for the Brethren not to start for   Pueblo untill they arive at Laramey. In the evening I rode   with the Twelve & others 4 miles up the river & returned we   saw large herds of buffalo come to there watering places   to drink, some geese, cranes & one pole cat 8 miles      May 10, 1847 ~ Monday      10th A cool morning. Before leaving the camp ground a letter   was written to the next camp put into a small box nailed   to a post 12 feet long one end put firm in the ground the     
 other end erect in the air as a guide bord containing the follo  wing words. Open this box and you will find a letter.      316 miles to winter Quarters, Pioneers. Lattitude 41°. (our   friends no doubt will be glad to get the letter as it contains   an account of our Journey.      We travled 6 miles & nooned then travled 4 & camped for   the night our teams are some weak in consequence of not   getting grass for several days as it was eat out by the buff  alo there was one buffalo, one deer & one hare brought   into camp by the hunters to day, & distributed among the   men in camp we have what fresh meat we want daily  the grass is some better to day not but few herds of buff-  alo on our rout, today we passed through some miles of   dead grass which we set on fire to have new feed for   the next company it made a great fire indeed we get   our distance daily now of our travel from a mashine   fixed to a waggon wheel which gives the true distance  we camped to night by an Island of cotton wood 10 m      May 11, 1847 ~ Tuesday      11th quite warm to day we travled 5 miles & made a short halt   then travled 3 1/2 miles & camped a little below the junktion of   the Noth & south forks of the Platt River I felt quite unwell the   use of fresh meet does not as yet agree vary well with me 8 1/2 miles  we see but few buffalo today some antelope & Deer &c      Professor Pratt informed me that he took an observation for   the Longitude May 7th on the opposite bank of the Platt from   whare Freemont gives the Longitude in his travels Professor Pratt   made the Longitude to be 100° 5' 45" making it two seconds of   a degree less than Freemont ownly about 10 rods which was vary   close calculating. He also found the Lat 1/2 a mile west of this nights   encampment to be 41° 7' 44"      May 12, 1847 ~ Wednesday      12th A cool morning. Mercury stands at 41, we had a strong   S. wind through the day we travled 8 miles & nooned we then   travled 4 miles & camped for the night on the bank of   the North fork of the Platt I rode onto the bluffs to take a   survey of the country which was about 3 miles from the   river & we found both on the hills & flatts through the   day, travel that we were traveling over the Soux hunting   ground there had been a large band from 500 to 1000 we   should judge from there signs over the ground from 8 to 10   days before us, they took the brains out of the large buffalo  generally their hides & some of the meet & broke up the   bones for the marrow, 20 100 calves were found dead in one   place with nothing taken but the tongues, legs to the knee  & entrails another place 35 calves were found dead   & washed in heaps whare the buffalo had been chased   acrosse the river & run over the calves in rising the   bank of the river. I found on the bluff their   medicine bag tied to a stick 6 feet long stuck up in the   bank it was what is called kinikinnick composed of   tobacco & bark to smoke I also found a saddle tied to a large   buffalo dung I supposed to show the next party which   way the buffalo had gone I left my horse in the valley   to feed while I went onto a bluff to see the country &   he started off not seeing the camp took the back tract     
 & I had to run after him & while following him,  I run through the great Soux encampmen whare   they had had there lodges while on their hunt I left   my gun there & followed my horse untill I overtook   him with the assistance of Br Fowler who came out from   the encampment & stoped him I then rode back got   my gun examined the ground & should judge their   had been 500 lodges there was acres of ground cove[re]d   with buffalo wool whare they had dressed there skins  they left much stuff scattered over the ground such   as peaces of dressed buffalo & wolf skins mogascins   &c I brought in a good dressed white wolf skin  distance of the day 12 mil      I could see the bluff between the forks of the river   about 10 miles above us the bluffs that I passed over   to day were more fertile & covered with more grass   than any I had seen on the Platt before a young   buffalo was killed & brought in in the evening      May 13, 1847 ~ Thursday      13 Many of the Brethren went out to visit the Indian   encampment & brought in mogasens, parts of robes   leather &c, we have a strong cold nort[h] wind to   day, we travled to day 11 miles & camped on the   west bank of a stream about 12 rods wide with   good ford that empties into the Platt this is nearly   opposite the first bluff that is formed between   the two forks of the Platt, the grass was better th[an]   it had had been, the bluff here for the first time   on the north fork comes hold to the river so that   we have to go over the bluffs with our waggons  there is one thing concerning the Platt river which   is worthy of note, which is not characteristic of any   other river that I have any knowledge of in the world  it is much of the way a mile in wedth & generally   coverd with water but vary shallow when a South   wind blows hard the water all rushes to the north   shore untill one would suppose there was a great rise   in the water let the wind shift & bolow hard from   the North & the watter immediately leaves the north   shore untill one can walk across two thirds of the   river on bare ground & the river constantly ebs &   flows like the tide just according as the wind blows  I went onto the bluffs hunting buffalo in the evening saw   several small herds President Young gave the stream   we camped on the name of the bluff fork.      I dreamed last night we had arived at our journey end   whare we were to build up a stake of Zion. As we came   unto the place there was an open vision of a temple   presented before me I asked some brethren that stood   by me If they saw it they said they did not I gazed   upon it & it was glorious it appeared as though it was   built of white & blue stone the sight of it filled me   with Joy and I awoke, & behold it was a dream 11 m     
 May 14, 1847 ~ Friday      14th I went out early in the morning to hunt some   buffalo I cashed myself in the bank & a large herd   came along, but their old bulls was out as a rear &   front guard & there was none of their young cattle   near enough for me to shooht so they past by I saw   some more coming I way laid them they proved to   be 7 bulls I fired at the youngest one while [he] passed by  but missed him I then returned to camp took  breakfast had a hard shower of rain & some words   with Br Fowler & started out again hunting Br Higby   soon Killed an antelope that was put on board   of a boat called the revenue cutter Phineas Young  & myself went out together waited for buffalo &   antilope I finally got lost among the bluff, but   found my way out again Br Phineas shot  an buck antilope & I carried him into camp  there was 3 antilope & one buffalo bull killed. some of the   hunters thought they herd Indian guns on the opposit side of the  river during the night an Indian cralled up to a pair of mules  that was tied togeth[er] & made a grab to ketch them they sprung & got   away from him one of the guards shot at him & he run all horses   were then brought into the circle & the cannon prepared for firing  but seeing no more it was not fired travled 8 miles      May 15, 1847 ~ Saturday      15th A vary cold North wind & rain we however travled  about 3 miles & camped in the best grass we had found on   the road, most of our road this morning was over & through the  bluffs as they come again bold to the river a large number of   barefoot tracks was seen this morning under the bluff on the  bank of the river, supposed to be the Indians that came down   last night to steal our horses, the rain stoped in the afternoon   & we drove 5 miles & camped on the prairie. distance 8 miles  we saw the bluffs dotted over with buffalo I went out with   some others to hunt them I could not get within about 30   rods of them I shot at the neck of one & the ball went into his   sholdier which crippled him but he hobbled away with   the herd & I did not get him but there were a number   of hunters among the herds & one of them killed a fat   buffalo which was brought into camp. the bluffs again come   down to the river a short distance before us      May 16, 1847 ~ Sunday      [1]6th Sunday still cloudy & cool wind. I did not feel vary   well this morning and did not rise untill 7 oclok which was   two hours after the time when I got out of my carriage   I found all five of my horses standing at the stakes while  all the other horses of the encampment had been feeding   two hours. It was Br John Fowlers business to let them  out but he did not get up untill half an hour after I  did. He Is destitute of the spirit or principle that a faithf-  ul man or servant should possess and it makes it   much harder upon me in the care of the teams &   business than it would if I had a true & faithful man  with me Br Burnham does our cooking which   keeps him vary busy & he has the hardest time of it  as much of the time he has nothing but buffalo dung     
 to make a fire of we are now in a place whare we are   proving ourselves & if we are not faithful we shall come under  condemnation. I rode out to day with Brothers Young   Kimball, Benson Rockwell & Stephens 4 miles over the bluffs  to pick out a road for the camp to go across to get again on  the bottoms we found a road through & returned to the   camp I picked up a young hare which Br Young took in to   camp, we saw herds of buffalo while coming in. Br   Glines went out hunting & shot an antelope & one buffalo  though it was against the rules of the camp & council of   his captain to go hunting on Sunday. we had a good  meeting in the afternoon Br I opened meeting by Prayer  Brs Richards Markham Rockwood & Kimball spoke  & the laws of the camp were read & a good spirit preva[iled]   the channel of the teaching was to harken to council & sustain   the Heads of the Church & go & do what was said unto us   & it would prove a blessing unto us 8 mi      May 17, 1847 ~ Monday      17th It is much more warm & plesant to day than usual our roa[d]  hads been hard to day we came 2 1/2 miles through sandy bluffs, we   again struck the bottom 4 1/2 miles from our camping place but   the bottom was much softer than usual & many slues to cross  we crossed about one dozen streams to day of vary clear water   that come from springs in the bluff from 1 to 10 feet across  them which run almost on the top of the ground without   any bank at all, with hard sand or gravel bottom, the water   however was not as cold as spring water generally is, the  hunters brought in 3 buffalo & it detained the camp some to   get them in, President Young was not pleased with it as  we had so much meet in camp already & they went out  without council. we saw vary large droves of deer to day in   the bottoms the most we have ever seen any day on the road   A young Fawn was picked up & brought into camp & kept  we travled in all to day 12 3/4 miles      I led the camp mostly through the bluffs in the morning before   Before Brothers Young & Kimball came up we rode together   all day picking our roads      May 18, 1847 ~ Tuesday      18th The camp was called together or the captains of companies  & President Young sharply reproved, the hunters for shooting  so much meet when it was not needed & detaining the   camp or for taking life any more than could be helepd and   also the horsman for their indiferance in picking out the  road he said there was but two that had rode thant manifested   any interest in helping him get the camp along. He  spoke vary sharply upon the indiferance of men, & they   rejected the meet when it was brought into camp &c  the camp started out after the meet was disposed of  & the hunters or horsman went forward to pick out the   road instead of going hunting I did not hear a gun fired  on the road during the day Amasa Lyman was one called   by name & reproved for not paying any attention to seeking   out the road, but he was with us to day in that business  we rode 6 miles & cnooned we rode in the afternoon   9 3/4 miles & camped for the night distance of the day 15 3/4 m     
 May 19, 1847 ~ Wednesday      19th we crossed the worse sand hill bluff of about one   mile that we have crossed on the journey & what made it still   worse the rain was pouring down upon us continually we travled   about 1/2 mile on the flat & camped untill the rain was over for   the time being we started again at 3 oclok but it soon began to rain   again hard we travled untill 5 oclok & camped for the night on the bank   of the river we travled 8 miles by the wheelometer 8 miles      I rode forward during the day in the rain & picked out the road   we had the most water fall during the day and evening that we   have met with on the whole journey      May 20, 1847 ~ Thursday      20th we came 7 miles & camped for our nooning on the North   side of the Platt opposite Ash Creek that comes through the   bluffs to the Platt on the south side of the river whare the  Origon road first strikes the north fork of the Platt several   of the brethren went over in a boat that we were taking with   us & exhamined the rock bluffs, road, creek, &c & returned   with some ash. rock, wild curands & cherry &c we came  on 8 3/4 miles & camped for the night we crossed a large   creek about 12 rods across it which we supposed it to be   a creek that Glos Cload called the Rawhiyde we had a  vary good road most of the day on the bank of the   River, we have passed a good deal of rock bluff on both   sides of the river, & some on the south side of the river   was formed into natural terrices, rotundas, squairs &c 50   or 100 feet high looked liked good foundations to build   forts & fortications & strong holds upon they resemble   the work of art & look some like the old castles  of England & Scotland they were level on the top. A short   distance above Ash Creek there is a beautiful ceder Island   in the river which is a good beacon to show travelers wha  res the oregon road strikes the river. we have had  a cool, windy, cloudy day whole distance 15 3/4 m      Brother Egbert drove Br Pratts carriage tongue into   the hind end of my carriage & broke in the end bord  & the water came in when it rained so that it wet my   again things & to day Br Fowler run his waggon into  it again to day but when I spoke to him about it he denyed  it which caused some words between us. we had some  little rain to day. The bluffs on the opposite side that I have   described above are named Castle Bluffs & the stream that was called   rawhide is called Castle Creek      May 21, 1847 ~ Friday      21st Before we left the encampment Br Clayton put up a guide board   with the following inscription for the benefit of the next camp   from winter Quarters 409 miles from the Junction 93 1/4 ceder   bluff 36 1/2 Ash Hollow 8 miles, & 133 from Fort Laramee  we travled to day 7 1/2 miles & nooned in the afternoon 8 m  & camped for the night. we saw 8 or 10 buffalo today but  have not seen but few for several days we saw some deer &   antilope to day I killed a bagger with the jaw bone of a   buffalo. Just as we got to a camping place two Indians came   from the bluffs riding towards us & made signs for us to come   to them several of the brethren went, it was a Sioux Indian & his   wife they talked by signs awhile & went away distance of the day 15 1/2 miles     
 May 22, 1847 ~ Saturday      22. The brethren found a part of a petrified leg bone of a Mamouth  it was from the knee joint downward the piece was 17 inch   long. 11 inches wide & weighed 27 lbs. we travled to day 7 1/2   miles & onooned & in the afternoon 8 miles & camped for   the Sabbath, whole distance of the day 15 1/2 m      our road has been vary strait to day but we came over 2 1/2 miles   of the worst bluff sandy & hilly that we have past on   the rout. we have also past several large creek beds of   dry sand, the bluffs on our rout to day have presented   the most singular natural senery that I ever beheld in   my travels on the earth. It has the greatest appearance   of the old walls & ruins of the castles of Europe from   the size of chimneys to 100 feet square or more, bodies   of earth & rock that appears as though it was formed   out of clay stand erect scattering through the bluffs   from 10 to 100 feet high, with perpendicular   sides as strait as walls of a building while all   the earth around them have been washed away   to their base with rain & time. A spring of cold   water was found in the top of one of these peaks   apparently in a small basin of stone. there are   considerable number of rattle snakes come out of   these bluffs I sayw near a dozen to day a good   share of the rout this afternoon the face of the   earth is barren almost destitute of grass      May 23, 1847 ~ Sunday      23rd ^Sunday^ In company with B Young & the Twelve we visited the   top of two of the highest bluff ruins that lie opposite our   encampment which were truly a curiosity. O. Pratt took a   barometrical observation on the ownly tree which was red ceder   on the top of the ruins or bluff which we visited we had   a fair view of chimney rock from whare we were. I   carried a bleached buffalo bulls head on to the top &   wrote upon it with a pencil our names & distances from   several places for the benefit of the next camp while   Br Fairbanks [blank] was on one of these bluffs he   was bit with a rattlesnake & became vary painful before   he reached camp the Brethren commenced giving   him such things as they thought best. And he soon was   better. The camp met at half past 11 ooclok. E Snow addressed   the Meeting & spoke well. President Young then addressed the   camp in an Interesting manner, said he was satisfyed that   the Lord was with us & Leading us had never seen a company   of people more united than the camp had been thus far on the   journey, that we should pluck the fruits of this mission to all   Eternity that he had many things to teach us but could not   do it ownly in a stake of Zion. But he was well satisfyed   with himself, his brethren the Twelve & the camp at large one   thing he would say to the praise of all, that was not one   had refused to obey his council on the road. His peace with   God was continually like a river & he felt that the spirit of   peace rested upon the whole camp. many good things were   said. Several other brethren followed him after which   meeting was dismissed. we intended to have rode out in the   evening, but we saw that a storm was gathering, & it soon   began to blow vary hard about as much as we could do to   save our waggons bows & covers from being smashed     
 the hard wind continued for about an hour then it commenced   raining & which lasted about one hour accompanied with some hail  it turned vary cold I had fears that some of our horses would   perish with the cold as such changes were freequent in this   region Mr Sarpee related a circumstance that transpired sev  eral years since at about this place on the 22nd of May one   day earlier than this while travling down this fork of the platt  it was warm weather the grass 10 inch high it began to rain   some in the afternoon & turned cold in the evening & before   morning 16 of his best horses were frozen to death by the side   of the waggons & his boates boats froze into the Ice in the river  the changes are vary great in this country & when I see it   turning so cold I coverd all my horses with blankets that   I coudld I got up several times in the night to see to then  It rained occasionally in the night. the horses shook with   cold but morning came & all was alive as soon as they were   let loose they run to warm themselves.      May 24, 1847 ~ Monday      24th It was a cold morning yesterday morning the Thermometer   stood at 52°, at noon 82, & this morning 38 accompanied with   north wind, we travled 10 miles & nooned. I dreamed this mor-  ning that some Indians came into camp in a friendly manner   & stole 6 horses before our eyes & rode off we gave them   chase on horsback & I awoke.      As soon as we camped   this noon two Indians came to the camp they were Sioux  they were well dressed & clean we gave them some dinner   & showed them an Indian dog that had followed us several   days but the dog would not follow them they soon left the   camp. Chimney rock still grows plainer to our view  we drove in the afternoon 6 1/2 miles & camped near the quick   sand mountain that run in a ridge from the river back that   apparently had been heaped up by the wind I rode about   two miles forward to find grass and a camping place and on   my return I saw about 30 Soux Indians Plunge their horses   Into the River on the opposite side & make towards us I rode   with several others to the river & met them as they came   out they shook hands with us, vary friendly, the Chief   unfurled a large American Flag with the Eagle stars & stripes   & presented me a Letter. It was written in french we   however made it out, they were all well dressed the Chief   was dressed in a military coat. the Brethren from Camp   brought a white flag & stuck down by the side of theirs  they wanted to go into Camp we proposed for 5 of them   to go & the rest to remain in Camp but they all wiched   to come so we let them. we gave them supper they  remained about camp all night, but were good & stole   nothing. distance of the day 16 1/2 —      May 25, 1847 ~ Tuesday      25th The Sioux are in camp this morning we gave them   Breakfast they stayed with us untill we started some little   traiding was done they were men women & children they   crossed the river when we left & behaved well we drove   2 miles & dbated our horses, then drove untill 1 oclok & nooned  then drove untill 6 oclok & camped for the night distance 12 m      I was unwell had the Rheumatism in shoulders & back & teeth ake  had to keep the carriage I read Hastings account of Calafornia   He tells some great stories about California & oregon we camped   within about 4 mi[l]es of Chimney rock     
 May 26, 1847 ~ Wednesday      26th we travled 6 1/4 miles & nooned in good grass about 2 miles   above Chimney rock we travled in the afternoon 6 1/4 miles   & camped for the night. The hunters brought in four Antelope  we passed much good grass to day. I rode to day with Br Kimball   & Benson to look out the road I have during the last two days   read Mr Hastings account of Oregon & upper Calafornia. He has   greatly exhagerated the account of upper Calafornia.      Just before camping at noon while travling on a smooth prairie   an accurance took place which liked to have proven of serious  consequence to our camp. An Indian Horse that was bought of the  Sioux ran away with a whi singletree to his heels & gave a trem-  endious fright to the cows, oxen & horses that were attached  to the waggons and in an instant a dozen or more waggons   were darting by each other like lightning & the horses & mules   flying as it were over the ground some turned to the right &   some to the left some run into other waggons, the horse & mule   that Br Fowler was driving leaped with all spead, with Br  Little hold of the lines & Br Fowler hold of the bits they darted   by my carriage like electricity & came within one inch of a   collission with my wheels if they had locked we should have   been a wreck another waggon followed by in the same manner   with a pair of Mules & one yoke of cattle upon a keen run which   would also have smashed my carriage if they had hit it but   my own horses by this time started to run but was soon  held up by the driver, Br Fowlers waggon continued to rooll  regardless of rough or smooth ground for about fifty rods &   he draged the whole distance by the bit which was the   case with many others, but all was soon stoped & returned   to there lines without any accident to any team or waggon   which appeared to me truly a miricle William Smoots team  run away also with great speed. It give us sumthing of an   Idea what an Indian yell would would do in such an encamp-  ment with teams hitched to waggons. A person can hardly   concieve of the power that is manifest in animals esspecially  mules when in such a fright. But I felt thankful that no   accident happened.      By an Imperfect measurment, by a Trigonometrical observation  by the Sexton Professor Pratt made the Chimney rock to be 260 feet  above the level of the river. distance of the day 12 1/2 m      May 27, 1847 ~ Thursday      27th we started 15 m before 8 oclok travled in a strait line 8 mile  & nooned in good grass Br Kimball & myself picked the road  in the foornoon & it was left to me in the afternoon & I piloted  the road in the afternoon as strait as any road that had been   made on the whole rout & picked out a camping ground on   the bank of the river in good feed we travled 5 3/4 miles 13 3/4      It should be understood that we are piloting a road for   the House of Israel to travel in for many years to come  therefore it requires the greater care. The hunters brought  in 5 Antilope to day. we camped at half past 4 oclock  opposite Scotts Bluff at Lattitude 41º, 50', 52." the wedth   of the river 772 yards a wind soon arose accompanied by   thunder & lightning we had but little rain.     
 May 28, 1847 ~ Friday      28th A cold rainy morning the camp concluded not to start  untill it stop raining. so we started at 10 oclok & travled 11 1/2   miles & camped for the night on the bank of the river it was a damp  cold day we passed alongside of a clear strem of water with some   beaver dams & houses upon it at one place it raised the water about   two feet which was lined with fish a good share of which was   speckled trout so the brethren informed me this is the first strea-  m I have met with containing trout since I left the New   England States. Therefore I name it trout creek it was not more   than 3 miles long it arose from a large pure spring. it was but a little   above Scotts Bluffs [FIGURE] distance of the day 11 1/2      during the evening President Young called at my fire & seeing   several of the brethering playing dominoes in a waggon near  by began to teach by saying that the devil was getting power over   the camp that for several days past nearly the whole camp had   drank into a spirit of card, checker, & domino playing & dancing   & the spirit of folley & if they did not spedily repent their   works, labours, & journey would be in vain that we should   not accomplish the object for which we had come but should  be thwarted in it. He said the Camp did not quarel any to be   shure for the devel would not set them to quarreling as long   as he could draw them away gradually from duty & fill them  with nonsens & folley, for the devil was vary cuning in dra-  wing away the people of God. I felt the force of his remarks  & thought them necessary. during the evening I went in to   the doctors waggon, read a chapter in the Book of Mormon  & prayed with them. After which B Young H. C. Kimball   W Richards E. T. Benson & W. Woodruff met in council   in Br Youngs waggon & Br Young wrote some of the  word of the Lord concerning the camp & expressed   his views & feelings concerning the camp that they must   spedily repent or they would be cursed, that they were   forgetting their mission & he had rather travel with   10 righteous men who would keep the commandments  of God than the whole camp while in a carless manner  & forgetting God, we stayed untill 10 oclok & retired to   rest      May 29, 1847 ~ Saturday      29th A cold rainy morning. At 10 oclok the horn was blown   to gather up the horses & cattle which took more than an hours   after which President Young called the camp together and  required each Captain to seperate or calle out his men & when   it was found all was present except two who had gone a   hunting he then addressed them, sumthing in the following  language, I think I will take for my text to preach my sermon  from, I am about to revolt from travling with this camp  any further with the spirit they now possess, I had rather   risk myself among the savages with ten men that are men   of faith, men of mighty prayer men of God, than to be with  this whole camp when they forget God & turn there hearts   to folley & wickedness, yea I had rather be alone, & I am   now resolved not to go any further with the camp unless   you will covenant to humble yourselves before the Lord &   serve him & quit your folley & wickedness, for a week past  nearly the whole camp has been card playing, chequres  & dominnoes, have occupied the attention of the brethren     
 & dancing, & Nigering & Hoeing down all has been the bet   continually, now it is quite time to quit it, & there has been   trials & law suits upon evry nonsensical thing & if these things   are suffered to go on it will be but a short time befor you   will be fighting knocking each other down & taking life   & it is high time it was stoped, I do not want to hear any   more such reportts as I herd last Sunday. of mens going to   meeting & preaching to the rest after he had played cards   untill meeting time, you are a putty set of men going   to seek out a location among the mountains for a resting place  of the Saints, even the whole Church of God who have been  driven out from the gentiles & rejected of them and after   you have esstablished a location you are then going out to preah   the gospel, seal salvation upon the House of Israel, & gather   the nations. How would you look if they should know your   conduct & ask you what did you do when you went to   seek out Zion, & find a resting place for the Saints whare   the Standard of the Kingdom of God could be reared & her   banners unfurled for the nations to gather unto, dut you   spend a good deal of your time in dancing pitching quare[l],  Jumping wrastleing &c yes, yes, did you play cards, dice   checkers & dominoes O! yes, what could you do with you-  rself, why you would shrink from the glance of the yeyes   of God Angels & men even wicked men, then are you   not ashamed of yourselves for practicing these things  yes you are & you must quit it. After speaking sumwhat   lengthy upon these matters he called the Twelve together   the High priest, Seventies & Elders, & found to be 8   of the quorum of the Twelve. 18 High Priest. 80 Seventies   & 8 Elders after which President Young said unto the   Twelve If you are willing to humble yourselves before   the Lord & covenant to do right & walk humble before   him, make it manifest by raising the right hand  when each one raised their hand, the same question   was put to the High Priest, Seventies, Elders & Members   & all universally covenanted with uplifted hand to humble   themselves before the Lord repent of their sins & keep   his commandments. President Young then spoke of those   who was not in the Church as there were sum present that   they would be protected in their rights but they must   not introduce wickedness in the Camp for it would not   be sufferd. He then spoke of the standard & ensign that   would be reared in Zion, to govern the Kingdom of God   [FIGURE] and the nations of the earth for evry nation   would bow the knea & evry tongue confess that   JESUS was the Christ and this will be the   standard. The Kingdom of God & his Laws & Judgment in   {the hands of his servants Ahman Christ} And on the standard would be a flag   of evry nation under heaven so their would be an invitation to all   Nations under heaven to come unto Zion, the Saints would have   to keep the Celestial law, and all nations & religions would   have to bow the knee to God and accknowledge that Jesus was   the Christ, but they would not be under the necessity of   being baptized or embracing the Gospel of Christ, but   they must acknowledge the right & reign of Christ     
 then if they felt disposed to reject the gospel & be damned they had   a right to, & the Saints or inhabitants of Zion had no right to take  from them their religion or persecute them on account of it or   trample upon their rights any way, neither should other nations   or religions trample upon the rights & privileges of the Saints who serve   & obey the Lord of [and] Keep his Commandments neither would that   be suffered as it has been in times past. And upon this principle   all men or religions may dwell with us in peace, if they will   keep the outward laws of the kingdom of [God] so as to acknowledg his   name & his right to reign & let us keep the law of the gospel &   obey his commandments undisturbed. After making other rem-  arks he left the meeting in the hands of the rest of the Twelve  Elder Kimball followed & remarked that what President Young said   it was the word of the Lord unto him & was just as much binding   upon him as though it was a written Revelation and it was just   as much binding upon the whole camp as it was upon him & urged   the Saints to give heed to the teachings that were given.      O Pratt followed & said that if the Saints had leasure hours   that they could spend them to much better advantage than playing   Cards as there was a world of Knowledge to be obtained & evry leasure   moment should be improved in storeing the mind with some sciensce or   learning some good principle and acknowledged the teachings we   had recieved to be of the Lord      W. Woodruff arose & said he had some things in his heart he   wished to say, that a burned child dreaded the fire. He had not   forgotton his journey in the Camp of 1834 and should he   live to the age of Matheusala he should not forget the hour when   the Prophet & Seer Joseph Smith stood upon the waggon   wheel & addressed that Camp & said that because they had   not harkened to his Councel but disobeyed, & transgressed   from time to time, that the die was cast & Judgment   must come that we should be visited by the destroying Angels  And so we were & more than twenty of our numbers   fell by the stroke & we all suffered much in our feelings  And I pray the Lord I may not see another such a time  And I would now advise my brethren to be careful in keeping the Coven[an]t   ywe have made lest by & by the word of the Lord come unto us as in   the days of Joseph & we cannot escape his judgment. I would   advise all the Brethren who have got cards to burn them up for   also checkers & dominoes, for if you keep your covenants you   have made you will have no time to use them & they will be   useless lomber on your hands. if you keep them for your children   they will ownly prove, a curse to them. And my prayer to God   is thayt we all may be enabled to keep all our covenants   with the Lord & each other I rejoice that the watchman   upon the walls or in our mids are quick to comprehend & warn   us of evil & reprove us when wrong that we may de saved & do   the will of God      Br S. Markham arose confessed his sins for card playing on sunday   before he went to preach & asked forgivness, then the camp   dispersed to there waggons & we all started on our journey  Br G. A. Smith & myself went together to pilot out the road  we travled 8 1/2 miles & camped for the night in good feed   though the whole Country was vary barren that we had   [page torn] [come] through. we passed today through layers of good     
 sand stone in the edge of the bluffs one large rock resembled   the hull of a steemboat loaded with freight so I named it   Stone Steem boat bluff. it commenced raining before we   camped it was vary cold, distance of the day 8 1/2 m  during the evening Br B. Young went out with the Twelve   & had Prayes      May 30, 1847 ~ Sunday      30th Sunday we set this day apart for Prayer & fasting, in   the morning I shaved & washed all over & anointed my head &   put on clean clothing, read a chapter in the Book of Mormon  & humbled myself before the Lord & poured out my soul in   prayer before the Lord & his spirit desended upon me &   I was blessed. I spent some time in writing my Journal. The   camp had a Prayer meeting, in the morning & met again in   public Meeting, President Young in company with the quorum of   the Twelve & a few others went into the vally of the hills & according   to the order of the Priesthood prayed in a circle & Porter &   Br Carrington watched to see that no Indians come upon us, we had   a good time, there was a heavy storm appeared but it mostly went   around there was but little rain whare we were, we returned to   our waggons & took some refreshment having eaten nothing during   the day, soon the Son came out plain & plesant. In the evening I   went out 2 miles with the quorum of the Twelve onto a high   bluff & had a good views of the Black Hills also Prayers      May 31, 1847 ~ Monday      31st There are many portions of this country vary barren we travel   over several miles at a time of level prairie with little or no grass upon   it in this ground we find great quantities of the Prickelly pair &   they are an excellent plant to eat though coverd with thorns like   needles which have to be carefully paired off with a knife & fork  they are quite delicious have a little tart but vary plesant      we had a plesant morning, our cattle was strayed so far it   took about 2 hours to get them up & get ready for starting  we however started at 8 oclock & travled 9 1/2 miles & nooned on a   green flat most of the ground through the day was vary barren  grass is again getting vary scarce Br Pratt took an observation,   & found the Lattitude to be 42º 4' 30" we travled in the after-  noon 7 1/4 miles & camped upon the bank of a creek about 15 or   20 miles below Laramie the hunters brought in one long tailed   deer saw several Elk & Antilope but got none of them I went   forward to pick out the road through the day I felt some unwell   with teeth ake & canker in my mouth. distance of the day 16 3/4      I would here mention that which belonged to the mornngs account   that there was a crust of frost over the grass the Thermometer   stood at 35, at 5 oclok, we passed to day a grove of large   cotton wood but the Sioux had wintered in it & cut down   the most of it for brows & wood, we are begining to  come to wood more plenty but the Camp has had much   difficulty to obtain wood to cook with for the last   weeks as we had neith[er] timber nor Buffalo chips. the   men would follow the river bank all day & Islands   to pick up any wood sticks barks or chips that might   chanced to have lodged on the bank by the flood or   that the Indians may have left, but it is now   to be readily obtained it is supposed that the creek   we camp on to night is the rawhide     
 June 1, 1847 ~ Tuesday      June 1st 1847 A fine pleasant morning, I had suffered much   from the tooth ake of late, I went, before starting on the journey  to Luke Johnson a dentist & got my tooth part of it dug out is &   broke of[f] & left the stump in my Jaw which pained me through   the day we travled 6 miles & nooned whare we had but   little feed, we travled in the afternoon [blank] miles & camped on  the bank of the platt opposite of Fort Laramie within   1 1/2 miles of the fort. when we arived we saw some men   approaching us from the fort when they arived on the  bank we found them to be a part of the company of   the Missisippi Brethren who had been to Pueblo through   the winter, Brother Crow & his family 7 waggons & 14 souls   were the individuals who were at the fort they soon stood upon   the bank of the river we lanced [launched] our boat & crossed the stream to them  several of the brethren went over to them among whom was Br Brown   that led up the same company to this place last year, they were truly glad  to meet, No one can imagin the joy of friends on meeting each other   under such circumstances away from the abodes of white  men whare they are ownly visited by Savages. Br Crow came across   & met in Council with us. And informed us that the remainder   of the Missippi company with the portion of the Mormon Battalion that   was at Pueblo would start for Laramie about the first of June  & follow our trail onto Calafornia. He informed us of 4 of the breth-  ren who had died one of which was Arnold Stephens, had herd   nothing of the main body of the Battlion. He soon returned home   & the camp met together, President Young suggested the propriety   of our leaving all our plows at the fort except such as we   should want to use immediately when we got there, to do up our Black-  smithing, Burning Coal, mending waggons &c as soon as possible   so that we could go on our Journey as spedily as possible, a  company was appointed to do herding & to attend to all these branches  of business, we then retired to rest I am quite unwell &   have been for several days I have canker in the mouth, bleed at   the noose, do not rest well nights distance of the day 12 m      June 2, 1847 ~ Wednesday      2nd In company with the Twelve & others I crossed to the river  to visit the fort & those who inhabit it we exhamined fort St John   which is now evacuated but the walls are standing the diment-  ions of St John are 144 by 132 outside, the Inside of the fort   contained 16 rooms, 7 rooms on the North west & 7 on the South  east one on the South, the largest on the north 98 feet long 47 wide  the Oregon trail runs one rod from the S.W. cornor of the fort  we next visited Fort Larimie now occupied by 38 persons  French mostly, who have Married the Sioux Mr Burdow is the   superinteder this fort is 168 by 116 outside, theer are 6 rooms  upon two sides, & 3 rooms upon the north & 3 upon the south   uccopied by stores blacksmith & dwellings it is quite a plesant   situation for a fort. Mr Burdow was a, Frenchman and a   Gentleman. He recieved us kindly and invited us into a large   setting room on the north side of the Fort, elevated about 10   feet from the ground, a flight of stairs leading to it gave us   any information he could in relation to our rout. Also fur-  nished us with his flat boat on reasonable terms to assist us in ferr  ying the Platt. He informed us that Gov Boogs & his men   had much to say against the mormons & cautioned him to   take care of his horses cattle &c lest we should steal them  [page torn] [to prej] gudice him against us all he could he said     
 that Boggs company was quarrelling all the time & most   of the company had deserted him. He finally told Boggs & co   that let the Mormons be as bad as they would they could not   be any wors than he & his men were. He had a number of  Soux women & children around him while we were there  About 20 of the Sioux men, women & children came with   Peltry to the trading House. Provisions of all kinds were   vary high & goods at the store flour 25 cts a pound tobacco  $1.50 cts per lb. After conversing with him for a length of time   we got into the flat boat about 20 of us & went down the   Laramie fork to its mouth about 2 miles, & up the platt half a mile   to our camp. After dinner we met in council & there decided   that Azama Ameza Lyman go to Pueblo with several other  brethren to meet the detachment of the Battalion that was there  for them to come as soon as convenient to Laramie & follow   our trail to Calafornia. I finished the letters to send to   Bevien & Ferguson I picked some greens & had a good dinner   of then though I am not well to day      June 3, 1847 ~ Thursday      3rd A vary winday day we commenced before sun ris to ferry   over our boats my ten was the first that went over the wind was   favorable we saw 3 men arive on pack horses last evening   at the fort on the oregon road we ascertained this morning they   were from St Josepheth they report 2000 waggons on the road   to Oregon from St Joes they are divided into companies of 20  to 50 waggons & that they will arive here tomorrow the first co  Mr Burdow called down to see us cross today. we set up our   Blacksmiths shops in the old fort to do our work. & made fires to do   our washing Br Burnham done my washing to day the fisrtst time   I have washed my clothing since I left winter quarters. Br   Frost set 6 shoes for me today & 2 for Br Smoot. In the evening  I walked up onto the highest peak around us, in company   with the Twelve & others we took a vew of the surrounding  country on our return to the camp we visited the Indian   & French burying ground the Indians were laid up upon   a staging about 10 feet from the ground, the French were   buried in the ground strong pickets around with a cross   at the head being Catholics, snow was discovered upon the  mountains through glasses      June 4, 1847 ~ Friday      4th [FIGURES] I wrote two letters to day one to Mrs W.  & one to Aphek Woodruff A. O. Smoot & J Benbow &   left them in the hands of Mr [blank]   who keeps the store & acks [acts] as post Maste[r]s. He appeared   vary friendly said he would for ward our letters that wer[e]s  to go to winter Quarters to the care of Mr Sarpee & those   that were to be deliverd to the Mormon Camp would deliver   them to the leader of the Camp on our arival. He truly  manifested much friendship towards us. Professor   Pratt took observations at the fort for the Longitude   at the fort.      I conversed with a mountaineer who had wintered at   the great Basin of the Salt & Eutau lakes & he recommends  the country vary highly for a healthy fertile country  the Lakes & streams abounding with trout & other fish     
 A good supply of shugar maple & other timber before we   left. Br Clayton erected a guide board on the north side of   the river containing the following information which he   took from his journals on the distances which was correct   as it was obtained from the wheelometer  543 1/4 miles from Winter Quarters 227 1/2 miles from the   Junction of the Platt. 142 1/4 miles from Ash Hollow   70 1/4 miles from Chimney Rock and 50 1/2 from Scotts Bluff.      we left the Fort & started on our Journey we took the right hand   road up up the platt & travled 8 1/4 miles & camped for the night, the   travel now appears to be attended with a good deal of interest   as we begin to ascend the black Hills which are universally coverd   with pine & ceder we saw one vary high peak coverd the top   with snow Br Robert Crow joined us which added to our compa  ny 9 men 5 women 3 children 6 waggons 13 yoke of oxen   20 cows 3 bulls 10 young cattle and horses which makes in the   whole Camp 148 men, 8 women, 5 children, 79 waggons   96 horses 51 Mules, 90 oxen, 43 cows 3 bulls 9 calves, 16 dogs   and 16 chickins      I was in great pain in the afternoon & night with the nervous head & teeth ake 8 1/2      June 5, 1847 ~ Saturday      5th   we have freequent slight showers yesterday & today while among the   hills I was sum better today we had quite a rough road today  we travled up & down the hills untill we arived at what is   called the warm spring which is at the fork of the two   roads that comes from Laramie we here nooned & visited the   head of the spring which was quite warm for drinking water  It boiled out of the bluff & made a little rivulet about 4 feet   wide & 3 inches deep it was clear soft water but no warmer   than I have freequently found water in rivulets exposed to the   sun the bluffs, peaks, & hills begin to be more lofty as we got   into the hills we are begining to come to an elk, bear & mountain   sheep country, we saw their signs to day we came in the foornoon   6 1/2 miles making 15 miles from Laramie to the springs soon   after we arived the first company of Moissouri emigrants came   up 12 waggons of them. Professor Pratt took an observation   for the Lattitude at the head of the warm spring & found it to be   42º 15' 6" we travled in the afternoon 10 1/2 miles & camped   on the west side of a small pure stream of water in good feed  the Missouri company camped 1/4 of a mile below us on the same   stream, they started this morning from the fort & took the   South road which is 5 miles nearer than the North road which we   took & a much better road. distance of the day 17 miles      June 6, 1847 ~ Sunday      6th Sunday this day was also devoted to prayer & fasting, the   Missouri company that camped near us started on this morning  I am still troubled with the teeth ake. the camp met for   a prayer meeting at 8 oclok the spirit of the Lord was with   the people, the Camp also met for a preaching meeting at 11 oclok   we had a shower of rain & the meeting closed another company   of Mo waggons of 20 passed us it soon cleared off & the camped   moved forward 5 miles & camped for the night on Bitter C  Creek whare the road leaves the creek for the hills we camped  between between the two Mo encampments one each side   of [page torn] waggons in one & 20 in the other and a plenty of grass 5 [m]     
 June 7, 1847 ~ Monday      7th The two companies started out before us this morning  we travled 7 3/4 miles & nooned on a small creek which   scarsly afforded water for our stock & but little grass, while   here another Mo company of 13 waggons passed us we were in   fair view of Laramie Peak with its top coverd with snow,  I found an abundance of sweet thisaly in the bitter creek   bottom whare we camped last night much of the shrubery   which we past to day was the black currand & goosbury  we travled this afternoon 5 1/4 miles & camped for the night on   the Horse shoe Creek in the most splendid feed we have met   with on the journey the other three companies went ahead  Hors shoe Creek is heavily timbered with cotton wood Ash   & willow it is quite a large Stream I went to fishing with   a hook & line to see if I could not get some trout but I   cought nothing, the Black Hills are a good deal timbered   with pine. The Hunters brought in two black tailed deer   & one antilope to night, distance of the day 13 mils      Professor Pratt took several barometrical observations at Larimie   during 3 days & found the highth above the level of the sea to be   4090 feet, the Tattitude was 42º 12' 13". By a mean of   six six sights with a good sextant the Longitude west from   Greenwich was in time 6h 56m 47s.5 equal to 104º 11' 53"   Lat. of the warm springs west of Laramie 42º 15' 6"      June 8, 1847 ~ Tuesday      8th we travled 6 3/4 miles & nooned upon a small creek   with little water & fair grass we formed a company of   men & went forward of the teams & cleaned the road of   stone we used pick axes, bars, spades &c it was a great   help to our week waggons the road was exceding hilly   & mountaineous, in the afternoon we travled 8 3/4 over   the most mountaineous road we have had on the rout  we then deesended into a valley & camped for the night   on Labont Creek with an abundance of timber water   & good grass. we saw nothing of the Mo companies  Br John Higby went forward hunting & saw them   when they started out, & they had such strife one with   another in trying to start first they did not stop to   milk their cows, & in clearing up their breakfast they   stewed their meal, salt, bacon, short cake, Jonney cake   beans & other things upon the ground through their   encampment & when we came up 3 wolves were   feeding upon the fragments I picked up a pocket knife   & spoon left upon the ground.      When we came   over the high hills to day it was so cold it pierced   us like winter when we reached the valley we   found fires the companies in advanced had built  we piled on the wood, soon got warm an antelope   lay before us the hunters had brought in we carved it up   with our knives & stuck it on sticks & roasted it on the   fire & it satisfyed our appetites finely without salt  Some traidere came into camp from the mountain   on their way to the fort G A. Smith sent a letter   by them back to the fort distance 15 1/2 m      during the evening we visited the traiders & got some inform  ation from the salt lake country which was flattering or good   account was given of it     
 June 9, 1847 ~ Wednesay      9th We started at 5 oclok & drove one mile into better feed  & turned out our teams, the brethren traided some for robes  mogacines, & skin shirts & pants with the Hunters who camped  near us and at about 7 oclock 15 waggons of our party was chosen  to go forward to make a boat to ferry the Platt; they went forward  we followed them, the traiders started at the same time soon another  party of traiders over took [us] who were direct from Santifee they  informed us the Mormon Battalion was at Calafornia went in  Jan & that Capt Brown was in Santafee for money for the detach  ment & would come on as soon as possible we travled 11 1/4 miles  & nooned in a valley without watter, in the afternoon we trav  led 8 miles & camped upon A'la'preel Creek when we rode up  to the Creek we overtook our little pioneer company that we sent  on In the morning to built the boat, the Missouri company was also  in sight notwithstanding their exhertion to get ahead of us, our  detachment followed the Mo company how far they travled I know  not our Hunters killed two black tailed deer & one antilope  yesterday & an antilope today I am still troubled much with the   teeth ake with the exception of this I feel vary well distance 19 1/4      June 10, 1847 ~ Thursday      10th In company with G. A. Smith I went forward to a large  creek 8 3/4 miles from our camping place Here we overtook the Mo  Company they were about 4 miles from our camp we nooned upon  this creek, in the afternoon we reached the platt river &   camped upon deer creek, 9 miles whole distance of the day 17 3/4      I examined a splendid grind stone queyry on the east side  of the road as it leaves the hills & strikes the platt At was  30 rods long above the ground & could readily be got at the  grit, was fine & nise the Hunters brought in two antilope, we  have good feed & our horses & cattle are gaining. In the after-  noon Presidents Young & Kimball rode with us. our detac-  hed company camped last night withe fore most company  & we have not herd from them since. Br Carrington   found a vary extensive coal bed in this creek one layer  of about 10 feet thick another 5 feet length not known  but was examined for 20 rods or more the specemins of  coal produced wer excellent, the Twelve walked on to the  river bank examined the river, feed, &c had prayers  & returned. At the blowing of the horn I did not feel  much like retiring to bed so I walked 1/2 a mile from the   camp on the bank of Deer Creek & found Br Clayton  fishing with a hook. He had caught about two dozen good  fish. Another Br Harmon had caught some they resem-  bled the eastern Herrin, they were about to leaves & they left  their lines for me to fish with so I sat down for half   an hour musing alone as unconcerned as though I had been  sitting upon the banks of Farmington river, vary suddenly  I herd a rustling in the bushes near me & for the first time  time the thought flashed across my mind, that I was in  a country abounding with the griselly, bear wolves & India-  ns, and was liable to be attacked by either of them ant any  moment & was half a mile from any company & had no weapon  not even enough to have defend myself against a badger  & I thought wisdom dictated for me to return to camp so I  took up my polls & fish & walked leasurelly home & retired  to rest which closed the business of the day     
 June 11, 1847 ~ Friday      11th we rode 9 miles & camped upon the Platt bottom   for nooning, we travled in the afternoon 8 miles & camped upon  the bank of the Platt within a short distance of the Mo   camp who were trying to ferry over their waggons, they reported  our camp to be at the ferry 10 miles or so above us, the   hunters brought in 13 antelops. the Mo company had killed 3  buffalo. A young antelope had hid behind a bunch of sage  to keep out of the way of the hunters I discoverd him & crawld  up & caught him in my hands but he gave such a spring he cleared  himself from me.      we rode our horses into the river to day  several times to se[e] if we could find a fording place but we could  not find any as the stream had risen by the melting snows of  the mountains, we passed some snow to day on the highest  peaks distance of the day 17 m      June 12, 1847 ~ Saturday      12th I started in the morning to go forward in company  with Br A. P. Rockwood who was riding President Young  Stud when suddenly he sprung upon my horse but  instead of striking my horse he took my knee into his  Jaw & bruised me considerable sunk one tooth to   the bone through three thicknesses of clothing &   one of them buck skin G A Smith & myself then  rode on to the ferrying ground & found our detachment ferrying  over the Missouri Company they paid the Brethren  $1.50 cts per each waggon & load, & paid in flour at $2.50  per cwt, generally flour is considerd worth at the forts through  this country at least $10 per cwt. It was difficult getting  over the river they carried the goods over in a boat &  drew the waggons over by hand with ropses but when the  curant struck them they would freequently rool several   times over in the watter & smash their bows out they also  came near drowning their horses and one man would have  been lost if the brethren had not picked him out with   the boat, we saw also on the road whare the company had  a run away of their teams a horse came runing among them  & frightened their oxen and they all started to run two  run up onto a bank & turned both waggons over with  women & children in & bruised them much, smashed jars  crockery, dishes, boxes & sundrys to peaces. one team run  into the river & would probably have drowned & lost all  had not a little boy jumped out beside the off ox which  frightend him & he out run the other hawed off & run  onto a sand bar he however kicked the boy against the  wheel & the wheel knocked [him] down into the water which  hurt him, but the seene ended without any loss of life.      The Blacksmiths had been to work for the Missouri Company  got flour money &c the company of 5 traiders had camped  near the brethren. Our hunters had been busily engaged in  getting game, they had killed 5 fat buffalo 4 bear one   old she bear & 3 cubs, & shot at 2 griselly bear but did not  get them those killed were the black bear. saw a plenty of  antiope deer Elk & Mountain Sheep the mountains near  us abound with bear & other game I found some buffalo meat  the hunters were not agoing to save, so I cut out of the hump   of a buffalo about 40 lbs of good fat stake & spread it   to dry also tryed out about 8 lbs of good tallow     
 I visited the traiders camp they also was drying fine fat   Buffalo, one of the bears feet that was killed measured   7 1/2 inches long 5 inch wide 2 1/2 inch thick two toe nails 2 3/4 inch   long 3/4 inch wide. Our Hunters brought into camp 8 antilope  the camp came up & camped within one mile of the ferry ground   in good feed had travled 11 1/4 miles 11 1/4 m      June 13, 1847 ~ Sunday      13th Sunday A vary warm day the camp met for prayer   meeting at 9 oclok. O. P. Rockwell, Brown, and another   man were out all night hunting. One of the men of the camp   started out at dark to go to the mountain to get some snow  the distance looked so short he said he could go & return before 8 oclok  & was foolish enough to make a bet of one dollar upon it, but he did not   get to the mountain by 8 oclok & about 10 oclok a company of hors-  man was sent out with a bugle after him fearing the bears would   eat him up.      We had a meeting at 10 oclok H. C. Kimball addressed   the meeting in an interesting manner, & was followed by Br Young   who spoke upon the liberty of the gospel, showed what it done   for us, saved us daily, exhaulted us to glory immortality & eternal   life brought us evry good thing, but in doing this it did not   do away with the law of God or the dictation of the Almighty   Some thought they wanted their liberty to curse, swear, stray   whare they were a mind to, run over the mountains, not regard   the laws & rules of the Camp, but would that be liberty, not it   would lead to death & not life, the man that left the camp & went   to the mountains last night, had he have met a bear he would have had   the liberty to have run for his cli life, clumb a tree or been destroyed  The way to worship God the most acceptable is to do each day the   vary things that will bring the most good to the human family  there is a great differance to be seen between us as a camp & the   Missouri companies that are going the same road or a part of the way  they curse & swear, rip & tare, & are a trying to swallow up the earth, but   though they do not wish us to have a place on earth the earth will soon   swallow them up & they will go to the land of forgetfulness, while the   Saints if faithful though they should suffer some privations here will   ultimately inherit the earth & increase in dominion power & glory untill   the Lord shall say to them, go to now make your thousands of worlds   & people them & make such laws to govern them as you are a mind   to for I Know you have no disposition to make any laws but those   that are good, for you always desired to do good on the earth, &   many other goodly words did he say unto our edefycation. He was   followed by O Pratt who exhorted us to give head to the teaching   we had herd & to improve our time in treasuring up usful knowledge   that we ought not to spend a moments time needlessly. Meeting   dismissed and the Twelve, Colonels, Captains, &c of the Camp   met at the Presidents waggon to consult upon what measures   to adopt to get across the river it was finally agreed to go immedi-  ately to the mountains with a waggon & team for evry two tens   & get poolls & lash two or four waggons abrest to keep them   from turning over & float them across the river with boats &   ropes, so a company of horsmen started for the mountains & teams   draw the polls. In the evening the flour meal & bacon was   [page covered] [d]istributed through the Camp equally that had been recieved   [page covered] [fr]om the Mo company for ferrying them over, it amounted to   [page covered] 1/2 lbs of flour 2 lbs of meal & a small peace of bacon to each   [page covered] [in]dividual in the Camp. It looked as much of a miricle to me     
 to see our flour & meal bags replenished in the midst of the black   Hills as it did to have the Children of Israel fed with manna   in the wilderness. But the Lord has truly been with us on this   journey we have had peace & union in our midst, our horses & cattle   have been wonderfully preserved from death & accident on the   way & our waggons from breaking down. Great good will grow out   of this mission if we are faithful in keeping the commandments of God      I have taken great delight of late in reading the book of Mormon seeing   the great & glorious things revealed & recorded in that book & that we are   now trying to fulfill the great things or some of them that Lehi Nephi   Alma, Moroni, Isaiah and many other prophets had in view in the last   days in building up Zion, redeeming Israel, warning the Nations &   sealing salvation upon the meek of the earth & laying a foundation   that the earth may be prepared for the coming of the Mesiah.      June 14, 1847 ~ Monday      14th At day light the two first tewo tens were called togethe   to make arangments for crossing. The Proposal was made in the   camp to lash 4 waggons together & float them but the curant   was so strong many did not like that moad we appointed Br   Grover as our Captain to direct the rafting over we finally con-  cluded to put our polls into a raft carry our goods over in a   boat & put our waggons onto a raft we commenced at 5 oclok   & at 9 AM. being 4 hours we had landed eleven waggon loads   of goods upon the North Shore with the little leather boat &   during the day we got over all the waggons belonging to our   tens being Eleven in all, and all of the rest encampment being  twelve tens ownly got over the same number that we did that   they floated therirs their waggons they floated their waggons   by tying from two to four together but they turned clear over   each other bottom side upwards & back again broke the bows covers   & boxes to pieices & lost ploughs axes & Iron that was left in the   boxes., most of our Company was in the water from morning   to night & all was vary weary when the work was done, we   saw a heavy storm approaching us, we had just drawn Dr Rich[ards]    two waggons to his goods on the shore & loaded them into his   waggons with all speed Just got through as the storm struck   us I sprung into my carriage & tied all down tight but the ra[in]   wind & hail beat upon me so heavy that I had to lay out most of   my strength to hold my waggon cover on both hail & rain came   insid my carriage untill my bed & things were nearly drenched  it ownly lasted 7 minutes but was vary severe most of the wagg-  ons & goods were more or less wet our horses run two or three   miles in the storm when it was over I crossed the river & went   after them, tied them up returned back & went to rest vary   weary, but had some plesant dreams.      June 15, 1847 ~ Tuesday      15th It is vary windy to day & our companies cross the river vary   slow. Another Missouri company has come up with us. I felt   somewhat unwell to day with the exposers of yesterday & the te[eth]   ake      June 16, 1847 ~ Sunday      16th About 20 men went down the river to day & dug out   two large canoes to cover over to make a ferry boat o◊t  to ferry over the large companies of emegrants that have ariv[ed]   & are on the way President Young thought it wisdom to   to leave a number of the brethren here & keep a ferry   untill our companies came up emegrants will pay for ferrying     
 $1.50 cts per waggon pay in flour, at cows, beans &c flour at $2.50 per   cwt cows $10. the brethren also made two new rafts & got quite   a number of our pioneer waggons over. I was quite unwell a part   of the day with ague in the face I walked out however with O Pratt  about 3 miles onto some of the bluffs to view the country we saw   mountains to the North towering into the clouds, we judged they were  not much short of 100 miles from us. we had our guns with us &   hunted some I shot one antelope cut his throat with a bullet &   he fell dead in his tracts. Br Pratt shot at another but did not   get him. this was the first antelope I ever Killed, I tried to back   him in to camp but could not do it well so I got two men to help   me. we had some heavy squals of wind & some rain in the   afternoon. In the evening many of us went over the river to   tie up our horses & when one company was coming back in the  leather boat they filled it half full of water & came near   sinking      June 17, 1847 ~ Thursday      17th Early this morning we swam our horses over the river, one   mule came near drowning by being tangled in a rope but the   curant carried him ashore & he made a live of it, the men   went to work to finish their ferry boat while the men contin  ued to cross waggons on the raft. All of our company got over  to day & the brethren crossed some of the Missourians, Some of the eme  grants report 1000 waggons between Laramie & this place & there compan  ies are ariving daily at the fording places, Brs Young & Kimball got  over to day & we all moved our waggons once more into a circle. this   is the 6th day since our arival to this place which is the longest hender-  ance I ever saw at a ferry or crossing a river. Our brethren run the   the ferry boat all night to cross the Missourians but did not get  over but few waggons. I am still in much pain with the teet[h] ake &   sore lips & mouth. I had the privlege of milking a Mo cow which gave  me a plenty of milk for Supper & breakfast      June 18, 1847 ~ Friday      18th We are still ferrying over the gentiles. Another large company  arived to day. Bro Frosst mad me some nails & set two shoes for me  on my Saddle Horse, we commenced gathering cattle at 10 oclok   & harnessed but did not start at all, but turned our teams   again, as all were not ready. We held a council in the  after noon & resolved to leave 9 men to tend the ferry   to cross emegrant companies & also our brethren who   should come after us, the men were chosen & we  met with them again in the evening, one Brother had petiti-  oned to stay that President Young wished to go along with the com-  pany his name was Glines he did not manifest a good spirit   & Br Young reproved him. He then delivered a short lecture  which was interesting & instructive, and said that when he   gave a man council he did not want him to reject that  council or to bring up many arguments to try to alter it for   when a man did it I will turn on my heel & leave him. He   sayes there is another principle that has tried many in the Church   because more will follow me than some Young Elder who  has not proved himself but if he was to try to gather to   himself the fruits of the labours of the Twelve & other men   would that be right. No he would be pulling back that that   [page covered] [w]as before him but let the Elders do as I have done & my  [page covered] B[r]ethren the Twelve & other faithful men go and preach the   [page covered] [g]ospel for years & do the will of God & you would have a train     
 following you even the fruits of your own labour & you would   be putting them after you, & not drawing back that which is   before you, the Lord is determined to esstablish his kingdom in   the last days & He will have a faithful diligent & obedient people   and He chastizes the Saints to keep them humble & make them do   thereir duty if we had not been mobed & afflicted but always   been in prosperity we should have been lifted up in the pride of   our hearts & not gathered together & built up Zion as we ought to   have done, so that these trials will work together for our good.      Instructions was also given to the Brethren who were to tarry to keep   to gether & be united, divide the means equally among yourselves  according to your labour, let each essteem his brother as himself. In no   wise retain that which belongeth to the traveller, steal not at all, be   careful of the lives & property of those you ferry over, & forget not  your prayers keep together & come up with the next company of Saints      The following are the names Thomas Grover, John S. Higby, Luke Johnson, Wm Empy   Edmond Elsworth, Benjamin F. Stewart, Francis Pomeroy, James Devonport, Appleton   Harmon. Thomas Grover was appointed captain      June 19, 1847 ~ Saturday      19th we parted with the brethren who were to att  end the ferry & the camp moved on having been   one week we travled through a barren country   to willow springs ^a spring of water^ & nooned being 12 miles, we  past the red butes & many rough picturesque   sceneries & camped at night by the poison waters  travled 9 1/2 miles in the afternoon whole distance 21 1/2      Our camping place for the night was the most wretched of any ground   we have found on the way President Young thought it might properly   be called Hell gate. All the water tasted as though it run through   a bed of salt, salts, saltpeter, sulpher the it was naucious horrible  the ground in the valleys & marshes was apparently one half of it   composed of the saline floresance or salty substance of which this   country abounds. Our horses & cattle being thirsty drank a   little of the watter & quit it some of the cattle got badly miered   in the marshes. The traiders informed us these grounds wers  poison & would kill cattle but ours did not drink much or feed   long we tied them up. The hunters brought in one buffalo &   one deer & 3 antelope      June 20, 1847 ~ Sunday      19 20th Sunday we hitched up early in the morning without feed  or watering & left our encampment of death, poison waters,   salt marshes &c & rode 3 miles to a good camp ground & sweet   water & turned out & bated 2 hours & took breakfast. this   camp ground was on the willow spring branch about 3 miles from   the head, President Young wished me to go on about 15   miles & look up a camp ground for the night, so I went forw[ar]d  G. A. Smith went with me to the head of the willow springs  we there found a doctor belonging to a Missouri company who   had been doctoring a sick family in a company that was   forward. He was of opinion that the willow springs were   still 10 miles ahead which was incorrect as he was then   sitting at the head of them. Br Smith stoped with the   dDr to wait for our waggons to come up & I rode on alone  After travling several miles Br John Brown came up   with me & we rode on together over a sandy barren, sage   country to a creek of good water containing some small   fish about 10 miles west of the willow springs we arived here     
 at half past 1 oclok we turned out our horses to bait & tarried untill 4 oclok   watching for our company to come in sight, but we could see no   waggons but saw two horsman approaching us, we waved a small   flag for them to come to us supposed they were some of our company, but   they were two hunters Capt Smith & another man from the Mo co  mpany carrying in buffalo meat to there camp they thought we were   Indians in the distance & made off. I mounted my horse & put after   them & soon overtook them, and made inquiries about our camp  they said they had not seen it, but had seen a company of about   a dozen waggons coming by themselves, I then concluded our camp   had stoped at the willow Springs, so Captain Smith who was the   leader of the Mo Company invited us to go on & camp with them for   the night as they did not expect to go but a few miles further than the   creek we were now on. As it was 5 oclok & we could see 5 miles on   the road back & no waggons in sight I concluded our company would   not come on & if they should they would go no further than the   creek so we accepted Capt Smith proposal & went on with him   to spend the night with his camp dut insted of his going but little   distance he continued on mile after mile & could neither find feed   or water except the salt & alkalie ponds & lakes untill we struck   the sweet water river at Indipendance Rock which is so noted   in Freemonts Journal & other travellers which was about 12 miles west   of the creek before spoken off their oxen had tiered out having   travled about 27 miles & much of the road vary sandy & we had   road about [FIGURE] 30 miles and was quite weary, the sweet water is   truly sweet to man & beast after travling through so   much ground coverd with salt, perlash, and alkilie water as is found   on the way we turned out our horses in good feed got supper which   was bacon, buffalo, corn bread, coffee Milk &c then lay down   upon the ground & spent the night under a tent with the Missour-  ians but did not rest well. I found a great differance between the   Missouri emigrant companies & our own, for while the men, women   & children were all cursing, swaring, quarelling, scolding finding   fault with each other & other companies, there was nothing of the   kind allowed or practiced in our own camp. But to return to   our camp I will say at a late hour they came up to the Creek that   we left back 12 miles, & grass being poor continued on 4 miles   west of the creek & camped for the night they travled 20 miles   while I travled 30 miles. 30 miles      The camp not finding me at the creek nor hearing from me   at all felt some alarmed lest I was lost, or got into trouble with   the Indians or some difficulty they blowed their bugle &   watched for me untill midnight & finally fired there cannon   while I was camped 10 miles from them not thinking that I   was giving them any trouble      June 21, 1847 ~ Monday      21st 1847   June [FIGURE] INDEPENDANCE ROCK I arose early this morning   took breakfast and in   company with Br Brown   we rode clear around Independance Rock I should   judge the distance to be about 3/4 of a mile, we exhamined the many   names & lists of names of the trappers, traders, travellers, & emegrants   which are painted upon those rocks nearly all the names were put   on with read, Black, & yellow paint, some had washed out & defaced  the greatest number was put on within a few Years some of them   were quite plaim of about 30 years standing nearly all the Comp[anies]     
 pass by put some of their names on the rock After going around and   exhaminedng it we staked our horses and mounted the rock I   went forward & gained the highest point of the South end of the   Rock which containes the names. After exhamineing it I then went to   the North end which is the highest part of the rock, here is an opening   or cavern that would contain 30 or 40 persons and a rock stands on the   highest peak of about 3 tons wait. we got upon this rock & offered up   our prayers according to the order of the priesthood, we prayed earnestly   for the blessings of God to rest upon President Young & his brethren   the Twelve & all of the Pioneer Camp & the whole Camp of   Israel & House of Israel, our wives & children, & relatives   the Mormon Battalion, all the Churches abroad and that the   Lord would hasten the time of the fulfillment of his prom-  ises to Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Lehi, Nephi, Alma, &   Moroni and all the sayings of the Lord of the Lord concerning   the building up of Zions in the last days and avenging the   blood of the Prophets and while offering up our prayers   the spirit of the Lord desended upon us and we truly felt   to rejoice & while we were attending to our prayers the Missou-  rians was burying a woman a little distance from the   rock by the name of Rachel Morgan 25 years of age being   the third one of the family buried on the road they were   supposed to be poisoned by cooking in new copper vessels  After surveying the rock what we wished we again   desended to the ground. I was the first Latter Day Saint   that ever went onto that Rock or offered up prayers according to the   order of the Priesthood. We had a view of our camp from this rock and   expected they would noon there so we mounted our horses & concluded   to examine the country in the regions round about we rode to the North   East about 5 miles went to the top of a high bluff and saw the camp   in motion we then rode to the foot of the Mountain to the N.W. & followed   under the foot of the mountain all of the way to the Devils gate through   which the Sweet water runs, while taking this circuitous rout   we passed a salt lake covering about 50 acres of Ground, we spent   but few minutes at the Devils gate at this time & hurried on toback to   the Rock as our camp had come up but before we could get to them   they had camped half a mile east of the Rock I met Br Young   going up to the Rock I related to him my travels since I left the camp  He asked me to go back with him to the rock, so I told turned out my   horse having rode all of 20 miles during the forenoon exhamining   bare rugged rocks & barren grounds & salt ponds &c and I returned   with President Young W. Richards G. A. Smith & others & we again   ascended the rock together & spent about half an hour upon it &   returned to camp mounted our horses & rode to the Devils gate which   is the name of the channel through the Mountain through which the   sweet waters run. It is 5 miles from Indipendance Rock &   while approaching this place from the rock as is the case while approa[ch]-  ing the foot of any mountain through this country a person is   greatly decieved in the distance for while An object appears but a mile   ahead of you you will have to ride 5 or 6 before you can reach it  we rode as far as we could into the gate hitched our horses & walked   into about the centre of the cavern. This opening or Devils gate is   400 feet high perpendicular Rocks 120 feet wide & 50 rod's long   & the water rushes through it with a roar, the rocks are compo[se]d   [page worn] [of] coarse grey granite with a vein of black trap rock runing     
 through it we spent about half an hour visiting this place then had to   back out & ride around it on the south side some of the footman   walked over the top of it we camped for the night on the bank of    the sweet water about one mile west of the Devils gate the camp having  travled during the day 15 1/4 miles and I 30 miles. Distance 15 1/4 m 30 miles   A guide board was put up at the gate saying it was   175 1/4 miles from the Fort Laramie, & 50 1/4 from the ford  22nd or ferry of the Platt River      June 22, 1847 ~ Tuesday      22nd we travled 10 miles & nooned. Br Lorenzo Young broke an axeltree  of his waggon which detained the camp some, two more Missouri companies   overtook us at noon, the camp started on & Brs Young, Benson Little   & myself, went back to meet Lorenzo & help him get up his waggon &   we were behind all the afternoon. A company that arived at noon   informed us that a man was drowned at the ferry after we left in   trying to swim his horses across & they had not found his body when   they left, two men also got some alarmed at the Indipendance   Rock by a large griselly bear they stoped to put their names on the   Rock & the company left them they started to follow on, one man  was on foot & the other on a horse & were met in the road by a griselly   bear who made a tract 10 inch long, they had no weapons not even a knife  the Bear sat up & looked at them a few moments & walked off & they  came along, the griselly bear are more apt to attact men than any other   kind.      We travled in the afternoon 10 3/4 miles & camped at the foot of  a mound about 200 feet high, on the bank of the Sweat water  Br Kimball & mysel went to the top of it & looked down upon the   camp & it look heavenly. we offered up our prayers & the spirit of the   Lord rested upon us we descended again to the camp the moon shone  beautiful. during the evening the brethren put in a new axeltree into   Br Lorenzo' waggon. distance of the day 20 3/4 miles      June 23, 1847 ~ Wednesday      23rd We travled in the forenoon 8 1/2 miles & nooned by the Sweet water   with the mountains piled up near by us our road to day has been   through a level, sandy, barren sage region for a mountain country  we travled in the afternoon 8 1/2 miles & camped on the bank of the Sweetwater   whare the road leaves it for about 20 miles across the sandy sage plains   without water or feed, we had excellent grass for our camp at night  we are in plain view of the Rocky Mountains at the pass & beyound  we had a vary sandy draging road all day whole distance 17 miles      June 24, 1847 ~ Thursday      24th We travled to day 5 miles & came to the frozen or Lee spring   and stoped and exhamined it & found the spring to be strongly impregnated   with sulpher so much so it could not be drank the water would boil up  out of a peace of bog ground yet all around it it was so cold that after  removing the turf about 6 inch a solid body of Ice was found about 18 inches   thick some of it we cut up with axes & spades. near this was small ponds   [page covered] [of] water salt & saltpeter & sulpher & peotash seemed to be in the body of  the water, pure perlash was found in such quantities on the edges of   these waters that the brethren gatherd pailfulls of it [to] raise bread with  others would fill their cups with salt so pure from other mixtures that   they used it we travled from this place 12 3/4 miles & camped upon the  bank of the Sweet water two days 18 miles from the foot of the pass  [page covered] [3] companies camped near us to night, this is the last time we shall see   the sweet water on this journey we did not bait to day but camped   at 4 oclok whole distance of the day 17 3/4 miles      Br Youngs team run away with a waggon I cought them by the  bit just as they were about to plunge into the stream     
 Soon after we camped Br Holman was driving up the horses   with his gon in his hand. He went to punch a horse with the  musel of his gun the lock caught in his cloths & discharged  into the best horse the best horse there was in camp owned by   president Young called his John Horse. He lived a few hours  & died there are many accidents happen in that way by   caring loaded guns with caps upon their tubes.      June 25, 1847 ~ Friday      25th we travled 8 3/4 miles & nooned upon a branch of   the sweet water in as good grass as we have had on   the way early in the afternoo we began to ascend the high  est & longest hill that we have passed over on the jou[r]ney  we travled about 5 miles before [we] reached the top on the  way up the brethren found snow banks 20 or 30 rods   long from 5 to 10 feet deep about 1/4 of a mile from   the road they brought some to me & I ate some  the road was vary rocky a part of the way over the   hills. we passed by 3 Mo camps who had passed by  us we travled in the afternoon 11 1/2 miles & camped   for the night on a small branch of the sweet water   the chain of the wind River mountain seemed  quite near us & covered with vast quantities of   snow & we are so near the top of the mountain  & surrounded with snow that the air feels like   winter whole distance of the day 20 1/4 mi  our teams fed upon white clover to night we are   nearly at the head of the sweet water      June 26, 1847 ~ Saturday      26th We started this morning at 8 oclok & travled untill 1 ocl[ock]   & nooned again on the branch of the Sweet much larger tha[n]  original stream in consequence of the melting of the vast bod[y]  of snow on the wind river range, & the hills that surround us  the watter run into many of our waggons; whare we camped   at noon there was a large quantity of strabury vines in bloo[m]  & white clover we travled in the forenoon 11 miles & in the  afternoon 7 3/4 miles & camped again upon the branch of the   sweet water that we nooned upon, we camped opposit the   table rock & near the summit of the South pass or dividing   ridge and I was quite asstonished at the road & country  to day considering that we were crossing what is called the   south pass of the rocky mountains it was the best road we   had for many days & had it not have been for the wind   river range of mountains full in view on our right & the  tabl coverd with eternal snow, & some snow banks 10 fe[et]   deep by the side of the road as we passed along & the table   rock on the left I should have thought myself travel[in]g  over the beautiful prairies of Illinois & Missouri except the   country was coverd with more sage that prairie grass   the road for many miles & also the valley of or plain of   beautiful grass lying North of table rock was perfectly   strewn with vary handsom cornelian stones I saw  more in one hour this evening than I ever saw during  my whole life either in the rude state or polished   & set in breast pins in all the jewellers shops I ever saw   in my travels in the world from the sice of a goose  egg to a pea. distance of the day 18 3/4.     
 Elders Kimball Pratt G. A. Smith & Brown continued on to take an   observation with the Barrometer on the dividing ridge & they con-  tinued on to the waters of the green river 7 miles from us that   run into the pacific while we were on the Sweet water that runs   into [t]he Atlantic; they supposed we should come on to them and   as they did not return several of us mounted our horses to go in   search of them soon after we started we met Br Kimball   on his return after us. He informed us that the Brethren   were camped with about one dozen men from Oregon on   there way to the States & they would stay together over night  [FIGURE]      During our travels to day I walked most of the way with Profess-  ors Pratt, & Carrington and our conversation turned upon the   subject of the original formation of God, Angels, men, & Devils   the begetting of Spirits in the eternal world, & who by, the beget-  ing of children on the earth, the Death of men & children & the   resurrection of all. Each one gave his views, opinions, & reasonings  & many interesting remarks were truly made. And any person   who should chance to read these lines I wish them to understand that   the Ideas given upon these points were not given as doctrin but opi-  nion untill sumthing better should present itself or be decided by   revelation. One of the most important Items If true was pre-  sented by Professor Pratt upon a subject that heretofore has ben   entirely out of the reach of all mankind from the days of Adam   to the present time as far as is revealed to us. It was upon the subjec   of the original formation of the first God, we all admitted in the   first place that which we believed to be an important truth ie the eternal   duration of matter spirit, intelligence in some form or other we also   agreeed in the opinion that Neither God nor man always had from  all eternity the same formation that they now have but did exhist in   some form for if we admitted the fact that one being exhisted in   the present form all might have exhisted in the same form as well as  one, then the question arose how did God recieve his present formation  the answer given by Professor Pratt was sumthing in the following   language. He sayes I t[h]row out my Ideas not as doctrin but for you   to look at. you know when a Chemist goes to work to analize or   try new experiments they often have to try many times before they   get a thing perfect & take certain processes which are unnecessary and are   afterward laid aside and pursue the most perfect course that can be   obtained. It may reasonably have been the case with the first being   formed which may be called God. As eternity was filled as it were   with particles of intelligence who had there agency, two of these   particles in process of time might have joined their interest together   exchanged ideas & found by persueing this course that they gained   double strength to what one particle of intelligence would have &   afterwards were joined by other particles & continued untill they   formed a combination or body though through a long process yet   they had power over other intelligences in consequence of their   combination, organization, & strength and in process of time this   being body or God seeing the advantage of such an organization   desires company or a companion and having some experiance   goes to work & organizes other beings by prevailing intelligences to   come togeth & may form sumthing better than at the first  and after trials of this kind & the moust perfect way sought   ought it was found to be the most expeditious & best way to recieve   there formations or bodies either spiritual or temporal through   the womb     
 June 27, 1847 ~ Sunday      June 27th 1847 Three years ago this day the Prophets Joseph   and Hyrum Smith were martered.       Though it was   Sunday morning we harnessed up our teams & drove 6 miles to   the place whare Brs Pratt & Smith camped in company with   Mr Harris who has been a traider & trapper in the rocky mou-  ntains & travled through Oregon & Calafornie 25 years we found   him to be a man of much experience & knowledge & acquaintan[ce]   with the Country. He brought a file of Oregon Papers & one   Published by S Brannon of Calafornia many of us had   much conversation with him about the Country He spoke   unfavorable of the Salt Lake Country for a settlement but  spoke of other places not far off that were good. He said we   generally could go through the pass as late as November   but should we get blocked in with snow we would would  find a small stream of water 4 or 5 miles from the Devils   gate near Independance rock this stream is 5 miles west of   the gate follow that up a short distance & it would lead   to a road that crosses it to the west which would lead to a   through a large plain following to the mountains whare   there is but little snow when you come to the pass or   hill get onto some of them & you will see a large   bute leave it to the [blank] hand & follow down [blank]  And it will lead into the open  valleys see * below      It is 275 1/2 miles from fort Laramie to the South pass      At 9 oclok this morning I passed the dividing ridge   that seperates the dividing waters of the Atlantic   and pacific we camped at noon on muddy creek   the waters of which run into the green river & the   pacific I drank its waters for the first time in my  life that I tasted of waters runing into the pacific  we had a warm dusty day I conversed considerably   with Mr Harris about the country we camped at   night upon dry sandy whole distance 15 1/4 mil      * 3 miles above the gate look to the South you will see an open pass in   the Mountains go through that & let your Course be west till you top   the hill out of the great plain, then look to the south you will see a   square bute leave that to the left go on & cross the green River then let   your course be west to Bridgers Fort, (And I think) he said we should   go by blacks fork      June 28, 1847 ~ Monday      28th we parted with Major Harris after doing some traiding with   him He promised to meet us again on bear River, we travled to  little Sanday & nooned the stream was high, in the afternoon   we travled 2 miles & met Mr Bridger of the fort on the way   with two other men going to fort Laramie. He was expecting us & was  to have an interview with President Young & the Twelve and also we   wished to have an interview with thehim. So we immediately turned  onto the creek we nooned on & camped for the night & Mr   Bridger & his men camped with us, we met in council & spent   some hours in conversations, we found him to have been a great   traveller and a great knowledge of nearly all Oregon & Calafor[nia]    the Mountains, lakes, Rivers, Brooks, springs, valleys, mines, ores, &c &   ie if what he told us was true. He knew of gold, silver, copper, lead, coal   Iron, Sulpher & Salpeter, mines. He spoke more highly of the great     
 [page covered] [Basin]  for a settlement than Major Harris did, that it was his [page torn]   & if this people settled in it he wanted to settle with them, there [page torn]   but one thing that could operate against it becoming a great gra[in] [page torn]   country & that would be frost. He did not know but the frost would   effect the corn. He said there was a spring at the end of the Salt lake   that produced both hot & cold fresh water, & hot & cold salt water   out of the same hole or spring, & formed a large body of verdegreece   below which the Indians get to paint skins, arrors &c. He informed   us whare to find a mine of silver & lead ore on big timber Creek we   conversed about a great variety of things. He said he was ashamed of   the Maps of Freemont for he knew nothing about the country  ownly the plain travled road, that he could correct all the maps that   had been put out about the western world. He said if we wanted   any of his services to let him know, the American fir Company had   paid him $2000 dollars per year while in their employ. He spent the   time conversing untill 10 oclok, we then retired to bed several of   the brethren bought dressed deer skin shirts & pants of [him] then they  would swap an outside dress for one Hickory or Checked shirt.  We had good grass & water & plenty of musketoes to night dis 15 1/2      June 29, 1847 ~ Tuesday      29th we parted this morning with Mr Bridger who remarked that   it would not be prudent to bring a great population into the   bason untill we ascertained whether grain would grow or not   we travled on to big Sandy 8 miles & nooned it was a vary hot   day, these streams are now up but during Summer they become   entirely dry, we nooned two hours & then drove onto the bank   of the Big Sandy 15 3/4 miles & camped for the night this campground  is the last time we meet with Big Sandy 8 miles east of the ferry   on green River the road to day, as has been the case through a  great portion of this country has been over a hot sandy desert with   scearsly any green thing except the various species of the wild sage   from 6 inches to 8 feet high with stocks from 1/4 of an inch to 4 inches   in diameter we have to use it for firewood & it makes quite a good   substitute. O. P. Rockwell & myself went forward to pick out a camp   ground we was ahead about 6 miles of the camp when we found   one which was the first place we could get grass for 15 miles   from whare we nooned, it made the longest days journey   we had made on the whole route. I returned to meet the c[amp] [page covered]  about 4 miles & was informed that Br Fowler was vary sick   & in my carriage I went back & met him & found him in great   distress in his head, back, & bones through out. He complained bitt  rly of the jar of the waggon. And finally was out of his head &   became wild. I did not get into camp untill near 9 oclok, I then   commenced doctoring him with composition, tea, pills &c & he   soon began to get better & had a comfortable nights rest distance of the day 23 3/4      June 30, 1847 ~ Wednesday      30th Br Fowler was some better this morning seemed to be threatned   with the ague kept his bed & rode in the waggon, we travled   8 miles & camped upon the bank of the green river at the ferry & the   afternoon was spent in building a raft as the river was high it   could not be crossed ownly upon rafts or boats. It was 235 1/2 miles   from the fort Laramie to the South pass of the rocky mountains      During the afternoon the arival of Elder Samuel S Brannan from   the bay of San Francisco was anounced in camp, we were truly glad [to] [page covered]  meet with him that we might hear from him & the Saints who w[ere] [page covered]  with him. He gave us an account of there landing their travels & t[he] [page covered]  present settlement which was 200 miles up the river from the b[ay] [page covered]     
 [page torn] [The]y were putting in wheat & preparing for us He had come all   [page torn] [the] way with ownly two men to meet with us. the Saints were  [page torn] [se]ttelled with & the Mormon Battalion was 400 miles from him  [page torn] [H]e said Br Pratt was doing well. The inhabitants of one whole Island   numbering 3000 had imbraced the faith he told us many inter-  esting thigs & we were truly glad to see him distance of the day 8 m      July 1, 1847 ~ Thursday      JULY 1st We tried this morning to swim our cattle over the   river but had great difficulty in it. About 15 persons have been   taken sick within a few days with fever ague &c which is said to   be common to emegrants coming from the snowy mountains to the   plains or valleys whare it is hot wether, Br Fowler is better to   day some others of the sick are better some are worse. each   division made a good raft yesterday & are lanched this morning  Brother Brannon brought a file of his papers that he is publishing   with him to camp & a letter to Br Fowler from his wife. He also   informed us that Captain Sutter was vary friendly & wished us   to come & settel near him. He informed us that he saw more   timber on green River whare we now are than he had seen on   his route since he left Calafornia He came through a par[t] of   Oregon. We are now in Calafornia. We got over 10 waggons to day   among others my own so we camped over night on the south   bank of the green river      July 2, 1847 ~ Friday      2nd Two rafts have been runing through the day & most of   the waggons have been brought over we swam our horses &   cattle over this morning though with some difficulty, we   held a council in the afternoon with the Twelve &   4 men was appointed to return to meet the camp & pilo[te]   them up, Br Brannan was with the council, we each one   wrote our views concerning the council to be given to the camp  it is an exceding hot day, and both man & beast are much annoyed   with musketoes. Several salmon trout were caught at the mouth of   a slue on green river near the ferry one weighing 7 1/4 lbs. Several   of the brethren gathered a quantity of salaratus from the salarat[us]   bedes about 3 miles east of the indipendance rock near the road &   thought it answered as good a purpose as the manufactured article   for raising bread & family purposes      July 3, 1847 ~ Saturday      3rd A light sprinkle of rain, cool, cloudy & high winds, so they could   not finish ferrying, the pilots are preparing to start back to meet the   companies I wrote a letter by them to Aphek Woodruff A O. Sm[oot]    [FIGURE] and John Benbow, the wind laid & we finished ferrying in the   evening & the whole camp moved 3 miles & camped A guide board   was put up a mile from the ferry saying [FIGURE] 340 mile from   Fort Laramie      July 4, 1847 ~ Sunday      Sunday Independance July 4th 1847 A meeting was held   last evening & the 4 men were appointed as pilots to go back   & meet the company were called upon to start this morning   to go on their journey. I accompanied Presidents Young   Kimball Richards & others to the ferry to put them across   [page torn] [t]he river & when we arived at the river we saw 13 horsman   [page torn] [o]n the opposite bank, with therir baggage on one of our rafts  [page torn] [B]ut to our great joy who should they be bout our Brethren   [page torn] [b]elonging to the Mormon Battalion who volunteered into the   [page torn] [se]rvice of the U.S.A. one year ago this month & belonged to Capt     
 Browns Detachment who had been at Pueblo through the winter  Br A Lyman who we sent unto them had reached them & infor-  med them whare we are & the whole detachment of 140 of the   brethren were within 7 days drive of us, we drew up the   raft & crossed them all over but one who returned with our   pilots to meet the companies when we met it was truly a harty   greeting & shaking of hands. they accompanied us into camp and all   were glad to meet, this small detachment had come on to m  meet some hors thieves who had stolen about a dozen horses from   them they had overtaken them & got all but one He had gone  on to Bridgers fort & they calculated to follow him & get their   horse they spent the night in camp with us, among the names   of those who died was Mervin Blanchard who drove team for   me last summer. But I must stop writing the Musketoes have filled   my carriage like a cloud and have fallen upon me as though they intende   to devour me. I never saw that insect more troublesome than in certain places   in this country several traiders passed by our camp just at night      July 5, 1847 ~ Monday      5th we left the green river (which are the head waters of the   Coloradoe,) & drove 20 miles & camped on blacks fork there is neit[h]-  er food or water since we left the green river to this place but is   similar to the last 200 miles. A sandy desert coverd with sage, but we   find good grass on the Streams. most of the day was vary hot   & dusty yet towards night we saw a hard shower of rain some   wind towards the mountains a few drops reached us in this coun-  try it rains about the mountains but not much in the valleys &   plains. distance of the day 20 miles      July 6, 1847 ~ Tuesday      6th A warm windy dusty day, man & beast harnesses & waggons were  all coverd with dust we crossed black fork at 9 oclok, muddy fork at   10 & camped on the west side of Hams fork at 5 oclok we did not   noon at all today whole distanc of the day 18 miles      The sick in camp are most universally getting better, the face of the   country is the same to day as usual barren, sand & sage, with occasionally   a sprinkling of flowers some vary beautiful, the country during the last   weeks drive has appeared vary destitute of game none to be seen except   occasionally an antilope one was killed yesterday      July 7, 1847 ~ Wednesday      7th We crossed hams fork and drove to Fort Bridger & in the regi  on of the fort before we got onto our camping ground we crossed   more than a dozen trout brooks, the water run swift but clear, hard,   cold, gravelly, bottoms. the brethren cought several brook trout the   first I had seen since I left England the whole region of country   all up & down these streams were covered with grass knee deep, 10   of the battalion found a hors thief at the fort who had assisted in   stealing 10 of their horses they had got all but two, & the man said   they had gone to Oregon. we saw about a dozen traiders lodges about   the fort the fort was merly a small traiding post ore one duilding   not large distance of the day 17 3/4 miles      July 8, 1847 ~ Thursday      8th [FIGURE] The calculation was to spend the day at the fort, as soon as I   got my breakfast I riged up my trout rod that I had brought with me   from Liverpool, fixed my reel, line, & artificial fly & went to one   of the brooks close by camp to try my luck cetching trout, the men   [page covered] [a]t the fort said there were but vary few trout in the streams, and   [page covered] [a] good many of the brethren were already at the creeks with their rods   [page covered] [&] lines triying their skill baiting with fresh meat & grass hoppers, but   no one seemed to ketch any, I went & flung my fly onto the wat[er]     
 And it being the first time that I ever tried the artificial fly in   America or ever saw it tried, I watched it as it floated upon the   water with as much intens interest as Franklin did his kite when   he tried to draw lightnigng from the skies. And as Franklin recieved great   Joy when he saw electricity or lightning descend on his kite string in   like manner was I highly gratifyed when I saw the nimble trout   dart my fly hook himself & run away with the line but I soon   worried him out & drew him to shore & I fished two or three   hours includind morning & evening & I caught twelve in all  and about one half of them would weigh abought 3/4 of a pound each  while all the rest of the camp did not ketch during the day   3 lbs of trought trout in all which was proof potsitive to me  that the artificial fly is far the best thing now known to fish   trout with. In the afternoon I went to Bridgers House & traid[ed] [page covered]  off my flint lock rifle for four buffalo robes the robes were   large & nice well tan[n]ed or dressed. He called the gun $20 & the   robes $5 each, the articles generally at Bridgers fort were at least  one third or one half higher, than at any other traiding post in   America that I ever saw. His robes were $5 buck skin shirts $6  pants $6 dressed skins $3 &c while at fort hall, doe skins 50 ct  Buck 75 Elk $1 Shirts & Pants $1.50, Robes $2, &c      Professor Pratt took observations at fort Bridger in Lat. 41º 19' 13"  Highth above the sea 6665 feet      July 9, 1847 ~ Friday      9th I arose this morning quite unwell, felt threatend with  the camp fever, yet I mounted my horse and rode untill 10 oclok before  starting however I was called upon to administer to Br Carter who  was taken with the fever there are new cases evry day in camp. I   took to my bed at 10 oclok with distressing pain in my head, back, joints   bones, marrow, & all through the system attended with cold chills &   hot flashes through the body, and we travled 13 miles over as bad a road as  we had had on the journey, which makes it exceding painful to the sick, the   day seemed excedind long to me when we stoped at night I took composi  tion, cayenne and a dose of vegitable pills and I had a better nights   rest than I expected distance of the day 13.      July 10, 1847 ~ Saturday      10th I felt quite feeble this morning but felt that my fever was broke  we travled up & down some of the steepest hills we have found on the   journey & the longest, we passed through a valley 6 ", miles long grass knee   deep strong mineral springs, any amount of copper, lead, & coal, & lime &   great stone on each side of the valley it is an 18 mile drive without water  that can be drank there are a number of springs in the valley but   they run through mineral beds and are not good to drink, we camped  for the night 1 1/2 miles from bear River. by the best spring of water   we had found on the route & a small stream near by. An Indian   came from Bridgers fort & travled with us & camped with us for the  night, camp fires were discovered about 3 miles from our camp G.A.S   & others went over to them, and found it to be Mr Miles Goodyier  & several others with him some were from Calafornia going ba[c]k   to the States. Mr Goodyier goes by the name of Miles though it is   his Christian name he has setled at the Salt lake has a garding &   vegitation of all kinds he says doing well. He spoke of 3 rods   to the Lake, & talked about the country the Missourian that wa[s]  going to the States came through the 80 miles drive without wate[r]  or grass had to leave 5 of his mules on the road could not get   [page covered] [his] own through, this is on the Calafornia road. The subject a     
 was brought up again concerning the emigrant company who pe[rished] [page covered]  in the Mountains last winter they were mostly from Independance   Clay County Missouri and were a mob company & threatned to drive   out the mormons that were in Calafornia & started for Calafornia with   that spirit in there hearts but it seemed as though they were ripe for  judgement the snows fell upon them 18 feet deep on a level & they   died & eat up each other about 40 persons perished & were mostly   eat up by those who survived them Mrs L Murphy of Tenn whom   I baptized while on a mishion in that Country but since apostitized  & joined the mob was in the company, died or was killed & eat up  her bones sawed to peaces for her branes & marrow & left strewed   upon the ground      distance of the day 18 miles   whole distance from Bridgers fort to Bear River 32 1/2 miles      Br Luce was taken vary sick this afternoon there are new cases daily  It is vary severe but does not generalal last the brethren more than 2 or   3 days.      Three griselly bear were seen by the brethren to day some   were within a few rods of them dut they made of & did not give   battle which they are more apt to do than any other bear      July 11, 1847 ~ Sunday      11th Sunday we spent the day in camp some of the brethren rode   out to seek out the road & found a mineral tar spring it run   pure tar or substance that looked like tar quite as thick  & black. some thought it was oil it had a strong smell   & was 1 1/2 miles south of our camp several of the brethren   thought of getting it to tar waggons with      July 12, 1847 ~ Monday      12th [FIGURE] I started early in the morning & rode to bear   River and for the first time I saw the long looked   for Bear River valley yet the spot whare we stuck it   was nothing vary interesting there was considerable   grass in the valley & some timber & thick bushes on  the bank of the river my object in visiting the   river before the camp was to try my luck in ketching  trout as it was a stream famed for containing that  kind of fish it was cloudy & cool but I found  it a difficult stream to fish in with the fly in   consequence of the thick underbrush I fished several  hours & had all sorts of luck good bad and i  indiferent I some of the time would fish half an  hour & could not start a fish, then I would find an   eddy with 3 or 4 trout in it & they would jump at   the hooks as though there was a bushel of trout in  the hole, and in one instance I caught two at a time  I fished some of the time on horsback riding in the  middle of the stream which was about 3 rode wide   & when I could not desend longer in the stream   for swift & deep water I would have to plunge   my horse through the bear thickets which was   hard work to penetrate and I knew not at   what moment I would have a griselly bear upon  my back or an Indian arrow in my side   for I was in danger of both some of the time   I would have a dozen bites at my hook in one   & nearly drown 3 or 4 trout & not get one. I fin[ally] [page covered]  wound up my fishing & started after the camp     
 Having caught [ink blot] troot in all the Camp travled   9 miles & nooned in a valley I found President   Young vary sick with the fever. The camp started on   but President Young being so sick concluded not to move from whare   he was Brs Kimball, Benson, Rockwood & others stoped with him with   there waggons, we drove without any road over hills & dales had to   make our own road as we went along, we camped at night in Mathews   valley by the side of Reddings Cave, this Cave is about 20 feet wide   at its mouth 7 feet high & 30 feet long, at the back part of the cave   are large wolf dens or other animals the cave is composed of   light coulored sand stone vary somft many of us cut our name   in it there are many curious rocks that surround it we passed   by a mountain of pudding stone composed of gravel sand   sement &c its spires were reaching up like the pyramids of Egypt  The valleys begin to grow more fertile & the air more pacific than in   the wind River Country.      Professor Pratt informed me that his   Barometrical [FIGURE] observation made the South pass to be 7085 feet   above the level of the sea. Also it was 280 miles from Larami[e]    the distance of the day 16 3/4 mile      July 13, 1847 ~ Tuesday      13th I arose quite unwell this morning sore throat, mouth, lips &c  several Brethren went to meet President Young the Camp lay   still waiting for him to come up, Br Kimball came to camp at noo[n] [page covered]  and a Council was called of the whole Camp & resolved that   O Pratt take a company of about 20 waggons & 40 men & go   on to the canion make the rode as they go & if they could not   go through the Canion to find Smiths Cut off & make a road over   the mountain that we need not be hindred when we come along  there was 23 waggons in all & started at 1 oclok. the Hunters   brought in 12 Antelope ^yesterday^ & to day 10 we have found but little game   for many days untill yesterday & to day. President Young is  better to day but will not move untill tomorrow.

Brs. Sherwood Johnson & Dewey were so sick they   could not journey & we camped on the same ground with them  Sherwood & Johnson were baptized for their sickness & I confir[med]   them.

 July 21, 1847 ~ Wednesday      201st we set the tire on one wheel of Fowlers waggon we remain   in camp to day in consequence of sickness, Brs Kimball Benson &   Lorenzo Young went through the Canion of Ogdens fork which is [the]   name of the creek we camped on, the rout we are taking is Reeds   Pass which we have named Pratts Pass in consequence of his going   on to make the road. It is a hot day, the report is we have a   rougher road on ahead than any thing we have met with, the country   is vary mountaineous rough & steep many of the springs we meet   with on the way are saltish or mineral. The Stream we are on [is] [page covered]  Ogdens fork. In the afternoon I waided the creek two miles & fished   with the fly down to the mouth of the canion I cought 8 trout  there is none vaury large in this part of the stream 1/4 of a lb was as   large as we caught      July 22, 1847 ~ Thursday      22nd we travled 8 miles to day on Ogdens fork, ^webber river East Canyon Creek^ & camped on the creek   whare the Pratts Pass leaves the fork for good & turnes to the west  we crossed the creek eleven times in going 8 miles & the worst   8 miles we have had on the journey. Br Case smashed one of his hind   waggon wheels to peaces, & we had to wait 2 hours to bring his wag  gon up & continued the journey drawing the exeltree on a pole I   caught 2 trout in the creek while waiting, the sick stood the   journey better than we expected considering the road      July 23, 1847 ~ Friday      23rd We Left Ogdens fork, ^webber river East Canyon Creek^ & travled to the west 5 miles up   hill an exceding hard hill to clime, 5 miles brought us to the sum  mit of the hill we then descended the hill 6 miles through   a thick timbered grove of aspen & spruice balsom &c the tim[ber] [page covered]   had been cut out out of the road yet it was full of stumps   & it kept evry teamster vary busy to dodge the stumps &   not break his waggon. One man turned over his ox waggon   & smashed the top all to a reck there was two children   in the waggon but they were not hurt. the last 6 miles was   as bad as any thing we had found. Having travled 5 miles   up hill & 6 down total 11 miles we nooned by a splendid spring   in a small Birch grove, we saw more timber during this half   days travel thain we had seen in a month, & the valley both   ascending & descending was extremely fertile & coverd with   vegitation even to the top of the hills. At the spring whare [we] [page covered]  nooned we were met by Brothers Pack & Mathews from   the forward camps they brought a letter to us, & informed   us it was ownly 10 miles to the valley of the Salt Lak[e]   or great basan & 14 to their camp they had explored   the country as far as possible & had made choice of a spot   to put in seeds they considered it the greatest grea[z]ing [page torn]  country in the world but was destitute of timber as [far] [page torn]   as they had been, several fine streams of fresh wa[ter] [page torn]  putting through the valley. After nooning we travled [up] [page torn]  another vary tedious hill & down it into a valley [&] [page torn]  camped for the night, with hills miles high on [each] [page torn]  side of us I clumbed to the top of one hill over 2 m[iles] [page torn]  high was in a high state of perspiration when I [reached] [page torn]  the top of it. whole distance of the day 15 m      [bottom of page blank] 
 July 24, 1847 ~ Saturday      [FIGURE] JULY 24th 1847   This is an important day in the   History of my life and the History of the   Church of JESUS CHRIST of Latter Day   Saints. On this important day after trav[eling]   from our encampment 6 miles through the   deep ravene, valley, ending with the canion   through last creek we came in full view   of the great valley or Bason [of] the Salt Lake   and land of promise held in reserve by the hand of GOD for a rest-  ing place for the Saints upon which a portion of the Zion of   GOD will be built, we gazed with wonder and admiration upon   the vast rich fertile valley which lay for about 25 miles in   length & 16 miles in wedth clothed with the heaviest garb of   of green vegitation in the midst of which lay a large lake of   salt water of [blank] miles in extent in which could be seen   large Islands & mountains towering towards the clouds also the   glorious valley abounding with the best fresh water springs   rivlets creeks & brooks & rivers of various sizes all of which   gave animation to the sporting trout & other fish while the   waters were wending there way into the great salt lake; our   hearts were surely made glad after a hard journey from   Winter Quarters of 1200 miles through flats of Platt Rivers   & steeps of the Black Hills & the Rocky mountains and burni  ng sands of the eternal sage regions & willow swails & Rocky   canions & stubs & stones, to gaze upon a valley of such vast   extent entirely surrounded with a perfect chain of everlasting   hills & mountains coverd with etrnal snow with there   innumerale peaks like pyramids towering towards Heaven presen  ting at one view the grandest & most sublime scenery Probably that   could be obtained on the globe. Thoughts of pleasing meditations   ran in rapid succession through our minds while we contemplated   that not many years that the House of GOD would stand upon   the top of the Mountains while the valleys would be converted into   orchard, vineyard, gardings & fields by the inhabitants of Zion &   the Standard be unfurled for the nations to gather there to  President Young expressed his full satisfaction in the appearanc   of the valley as a resting place for the Saints & was amply   repayed for his journey.      After gazing awhile upon the scenery   we travled across the table land into the valley 4 miles to the   encampment of our Brethren who had arived 2 days before  us, they had pitched there encampment upon the bank of two   small streams of pure water & had commenced plowing  had broke about 5 acres of ground & commenced planting   potatoes. As soon as we were formed in the encampment   before I took my dinner having 1/2 a bushel of potatoes I repai  red to the ploughed field & planted my potatoes hop^e^ing wi[th] [page torn]  the blessings of God at least to save the seed for another   year. The Brethren had damed up one of the creeks & dug   a trench & by night nearly the whole ground was Irrigated   with water we found the ground vary dry. towards evening   in company with Brs. Kimball Smith & Benson I rode several   miles up the creek into the mountain to look for timber in  the country &c there was a thunder shower & it rained near  ly over the whole ^valley^ & also it rained some the fore part of the   night we felt thankful for this as it was the general corect  opinion th[at it] [page torn] did not rain in the valley during [summers] [page covered] distance     
 July 25, 1847 ~ Sunday      July 25 Sunday This is the first Sunday that the Latter Day Saints  ever spent in the great ^salt Lake valley^ Utah Territory|bason. we washed shaved & cleaned up &  met in the circle of the encampment. Meeting was opened by the  bishops & G A Smith Preached ^the first sermon while standing upon the cannon^ an interesting discourse & was followed  by H. C Kimball & E. T. Benson all of which spoke unto edification  An intimission of 2 hours met again at 2 oclok the Bishops broak   bread to the congregation. I then addressed the Brethren was followed   by O Pratt & W Richards all of which expressed the gratitude   of our hearts to our Heavenly Father for leading us to so goodly a land   & exhorted the Brethren to harken to council do away with selfish-  ness live humble & keep the commandments of God that we may   prosper in the land, several other Brethren also expressed their   feelings & there was one universal feeling of satisfaction thwith the   valley, evry man that spoke upon the subject said they were   joyfully disappointed that the whole appearance was altogether   better throughout the valley than they had anticipated or even  dreamed of. At the close of the meeting President Young though   feble addressed for a few moments and Informed the brethren   [FIGURE] they must not work on Sunday that they would loose  five times as much as they would gain by it & they   must not hunt or fish on that day and there should not any   man dwell among us who would not observe these roles they might   go & dwell whare they pleased but should not dwell with us  He said that no man should buy any land that come here that he   had no land to sell neither should he buy any but evry man should   his land measured of to him for city & farming purposes what   he could till & he might till it as he pleased but he should  be industrious & take care of it He also warned the Saints against  keeping any thing that did not belong to them that if they followed  this course it would leek out & they would stink in the norstrils  of Jehovah Angels & the Saints & though they might live with the   saints & die with them they would be damned at last & go to  Hell for they were thieves & nothing but burning through Hell   would clens them. He remarked there would be a meeting evry  Sabbath in thatis place or whareever we stop. Council was   also given to tie up our horses at night      July 26, 1847 ~ Monday      26th Monday The camp in general was busily ingaged in plowing &   planting corn & other seeds. ten men including the Twelve were appo  inted to go on an exploring expedition. I took President Young into  my carriage & travled two miles towards the mount^a^in & made choice of  a spot of ground for our garding with a small rivlet runing throug[h]   it sufficient to irrigate it which I named guarding creek we then  returned to camp & went North of the camp about 5 miles & we all  went unto the top of a high Peak in the edge of the mountain which we   considerd a good place to raise an Ensign upon which we named ensign   Peak or Hill. ^I was the first person that ascended this Hill^ Brother Young was vary weary in climing the Peak he   being feble, we then desended to the flat — started north to visit some   hot sulpher springs but we returned two miles to get a drink of cool  water & then went back 4 miles to the springs we found them vary   warm but not hot, 3 or 4 of the springs ished [issued] green water & formed   substance below that looked like verdigreese. After visiting them we  returned to camp quite weary. Brs Mathews & Brown returned to ca[mp]  had crossed the valley in the Narrowest place opposite the camp to the   mountain on the west found the valley about 2015 miles across passed  over a river 4 miles from camp about 8 rods wide which we saw fr[om]     
 soil as on the east, we then turned our course & returned toward  camp we had to travel 20 miles across the vale to get to the ford of the  Utah outlet we here stoped eat & drank & returned to camp quite weary  having travled during the day about 30 miles      we saw on the west side of the valley about 75 or 100 mountain   goats, sheep, antilope &c in flocks playing about the hills & valley.      [FIGURES] After we arived in camp President Young called a Council of   the quorum of the Twelve there being present B Young   H. C. Kimball, O. Pratt, W. Richards, W. Woodruff G. A. Smith  A Lyman & E. T. Benson. we walked from the north camp to about   the centre between the two creeks when Prest. Young waved his   hands & said here is the forty acres for the Temple (we had conve-  rsed upon the subject of the location for the Temple previous to this)  & the city can be laid out perfectly square North & South, east &   west. It was then moved & carried that the Temple lot contain   40 acres on the ground whare we stood. It was also moved &   carried that the city be laid out into lots of 10 rods by 20 each  exclusive of the Streets & into blocks of 8 lots each, being 10   acres in each block & one acre & a quarter in each lot. It was also   moved & carried that each street be laid out 8 rods wide &   that there be a side walk on each side 20 feet wide & that each   house be built in the centre of the lot 20 feet from the front   line that there might be a uniformity through out the city &   President Young remarked that he wished but one house built upon   a lot & they being in the centre if they took fire they would not   burn up their neighbors and if any man wants a Market to hous  it upon his own lot & not lay out publick grounds for markets & let   every man cultivate his own lot & set out evry kind of fruit &   shade trees & beautify the City. It was Moved & carried that  there be four public squares of 10 acres each be laid of in various   parts of the city for public grounds. This was in Lat 40º 45 44  At 8 oclok the whole camp came together on the same ground &   passed all of the above votes unanimously as they are recorded   & when the business part of the meeting was closed President   Young arose and addressed the assembly in a vary interesting mann[er]  upon a variety of subjects. Previous to this the whole assembly voted   that there be a committee to superintend the laying out the City &   that the Twelve be that committee & that they manage the whole   affair.      President Young in his address to the Saints remarked that   he was determined to have order in all things & righteousness should be   practized in this land. That we had come here according to the direction   & council of Br Joseph Smith before his death & that he would still have   been alive if the Twelve had been in Nauvoo when he recrossed the river  from Nauvoo Montrose to Nauvoo. He spoke of the Saints being driven  from place to place, and said the ownly way Boggs, Clark, Lucas,  Benton, & all the leaders of the mob could have been saved in the day   of the Lord Jesus would have been to have come forward voluntari[ly]  & let their heads been cut off & let their blood run upon the ground   & gone up as a smokeing incens before the heavens as an atonement   but now they will be eternally damned. Also said all the governors   & Presidents of the U.S.A had rejected all our petitions from first   to last, that when the Saints were driven from Illinois & perish   as it were on the Prairies then President Polk sends for a draft of   500 men to go into the Army what for, that they might be wasted  [page covered] be [wasting] & it was that [page covered]     
 entirely wasted away as a people, if the brethren had not gone   they would have made war upon us & the Govr. of Mo would have been   ordered not to have let us cross the Missouri & the raising of the Battalion   was our temporal Salvation at the time & said Polk would be damned   for this act & that he with many of the goverment men had a hand  in the death of Joseph & Hyram & that they should be damned for   these things & if they ever sent any men to interfere with us here   they shall have there throats cut & sent to Hell, and with uplifted   hands to Heaven swore by the Gods of Eternity that he would never   cease his exhertion while he lived to make every preperation & avenge   the Blood of the Prophets & Saints, that he intended to have evry  hole & corner from the Bay of Francisco to Hudson bay known   to us and that our people would be connected with every tribe of   Indians throughout America & that our people would yet take their   squaws wash & dress them up teach them our language & learn them to   labour & learn them the gospel of there forefathers & raise up children   by them & teach the children & not many generations hence they will   become a white & delightsome people & in no other way will it be done   & that the time was nigh at hand when the gospel must go to that peop-  le. He said he long spoken of giving a lecture to the females & when he  got time he intended to do it. He spoke of the duty orf man to his God   that he should love him with all of his heart soul, mind, & strength serve   & obey him, and that the woman in like manner ought to obey her husban[d] [page torn]  & not to have a woman every time a man steped out be a watching him   as uneasy as a fish out of water & as soon as he returns O whare have   you been, & what have you been about, & why did you not get back before   & many other things that was none of her business. Her business is to tak[e]  care of her children keep herself clean & house & keep my close clean  Instead of that the husband asks whare is the Children the wife will say   O dear I dont know I was so concerned about you I have not thought  about the Children, they are probably to some of the neighbors.      He remarked   that when we become settled here he intended to have a school for his   own family & all others might do the same if they chose or join togeth  er and a tutor ought always to be with the children & not let them   get out of their sight & when they get weary of runing about in the   house & garding let the tutor go with them to the public walks & keep   them out of the streets & see that they do not sware & take the nam[e] [page torn]  of God in vain.      He spoke upon the subject of raising children spirits  taking a tabernacle he said that every spirit was pure when it first entered  the body, but many persons have been ruined in consequence of the   Mother giving way to temptation & fretfulness while in the state of child-  bearing and the Husband ought to be vary tender & kind to the woman   while in that state and the Mothers mind ought to be excercised i[n] [page covered]  good things during the whole time & be calm & composed that what   ever temptation the mother should give way to would effect the Child   in after life. many other principles was spoken of by President Young of interest      July 29, 1847 ~ Thursday      29th President Young with his brethren the Twelve & others mounted   our horses & started to meet with the Battalion under the command of   Captain Brown, we met with some of them about 4 miles from   camp we were truly glad to meet with them we continued on up   & soon met with Capts Brown, Higgins, Lieut Willis & the train follo  wing them we exhamined a good grind stone quiry while on the wa[y] [page covered]  up I soon met with Br Bevin who went from my family into the   Army there was about 140 of the Battalion and a company of   about 100 of the Missippi saints that came with them from Pueblo   being about 60 waggons in all 100 horses & Mules & 300 head of cattle     
 which added greatly to our numbers we had a Heavy shower   of rain while we were in the canion which sent down the water   in the creeks from the mountain's with a rush & roar like thunder   resembling the opening of a flood gate the first rush of the water   came down with a front 3 feet high, some of the waggons had to  stop untill it fell which was but a short time the shower spread   over a good share of the valley whare we were setled, we returned   with the company at there head & march into camp with music, they   took up there quarters between our two camps on the bank of   the creek. While we have been exploring the camp has been busy   in farming puting in potatoes, corn, beans, peas, buckwheat, &   preparing a garding for garding seeds & will go to work to prepare   a peace for turnips our garding to day was divided off as each [ten]   had need, our distance of travel to day was 12 miles      In the evening Br Young with the Twelve walked up to the warm   springs about 1 1/2 miles from the Temple Block we went in & bathed  it was quite as warm as we could endure & be comfortable those   springs are healthy for the sick & diseased      July 30, 1847 ~ Friday      30th [FIGURE] We met in council this morning with the Twelve & Captain   Brown, Higings, Willis & others & herd the statements of the   officers concerning the Battalion & there situation represented  counsil was given by President Young to the Officers what course   to persue. It seemed wisdom for Capt Brown & others to go to the   Bay of San Francisco & report himself & men & the state they were   in Br Brannan would go as there Pilot much conversation took  place during council of interest, Dr Sanderson was spoken of who   had been with the Battalion and it was believed he had tried to poison   the Brethren to death, & that he would be rewarded for his crimes  After the Council broke up we mounted our horses & rode north  to the warm springs also visited the hot sulpher spring 4 miles from   the Temple block it ishues out from under a rock a large fount  ain of water forms a pool about 2 rods square 5 feet deep is   [h]ot [page torn] enough to cook an egg in few moments we could hold our   fingers in it about 10 seconds. After viewing it a while we returned  to camp, I then visited the soldiers camp & also our planted   ground I found some of our potatoes had rotted some was coming   up our corn was up also beans I returned to camp & had a visit   from Br Dexter Stillman. He wished to come into my family also   Br James Bevin wished to returned again to my family as he   was with me when he went into the Army.      At 8 oclok All the camps met together & was addressed for more   than an hour by President Young in an interesting manner clot[hed]   with the spirit of God. He expressed his feelyings freely concerning the   treatment of the government towards us in the same manner as he   did on the eve of the 28th. He informed the Brethren that there going   into the Armey proved our temporal salvation at the time for  the Governor of Mo had already recieved orders not to let our   people pass the Mo river if we did not enlist, the goverment intend   to diestroy us from off the face of the earth but through the blessing   of God we are here and I thank my Heavenly father for it and   He knew we should prevail Zion would arise the Judgments of   God would be poured out the Blood of the Prophets would be ave[nged]   & their cup would be filled double unto them. And if we were fait[h]  ful we should yet have Brs Joseph & Hiram & many of the Sain[ts]   in there resurrected bodies with us on earth & when we died s[hould]     
 not sleep but a little time but should come forth out of our gr[aves] [page covered]  with bodies that no mob could kill. we were much edifyed wi[th] [page covered]  all the remarks he made. the meeting opened with a shout of   Hosannah to God & the Lamb repeated three times with its Amen  Br Young said the Ancient of days was not as far off as many   supposed. At the close of the meeting I returned to rest meditating u[pon] [page covered]  what I had herd an appointment was made for the Battalion to  prepare a bowery on the Morrow for our Sabbath Meetings. 8      July 31, 1847 ~ Saturday      31st Saturday I spent the morning in writing, the Battalion we[nt] [page covered]  to work at the Bower, our camp sowing & planting. About noon  a company of about 20 Utahs visited our camp there seemed   to be two parties of them they came to trade with us & whi[le] [page covered]  traiding deerskins for powder & lead &c one Indian str[uck] [page covered]  another one over his head with his gun & broke it the old [chief] [page covered]  whiped them both, & during the afternoon the one that h[ad] [page covered]  the gun broke over his head stole the other ones horse & put   out with it soon the Indians found it out & put after him  followed him into a canion & shot both him & his horse [dead] [page covered]  & returned to our camp with the horse that the Indian sto[le] [page covered]  the Utahs appear vary friendly to us as yet, there was a ru[m]  our to day that the Indians intended to come & ask pay for   their lands, Br Young has expressed his opinion that we   should not buy any land of the Indians but as the Lord   made the land there was enough for both them & us, that [we] [page covered]  would teach them to labour & cultivate the earth Br Pratts   opinion was that we should not feed them at all untill th[ey] [page covered]  had done sumthing for it so as to begin right with them & teac[h] [page covered]  them industry.      During the evening I went down to the   Utah outlet with several of the brethren & drew a net 4 ti[mes] [page covered]  & caught one fish, they needed a boat & could not get m[any] [page covered]  fish without it, travled during the day 123 m      August 1, 1847 ~ Sunday      August 1st Sunday. The congregation of the Saints assemb[led] [page covered]  under the Bower on the Temple lot at 10 oclok meeting opened  by singing & prayer Br Kimball addressed the meeting for a   while & expressed his feelings upon a variety of subjects af[ter] [page covered]  which Br O Pratt preached a discourse upon the Prophecies  of Isaiah & others concerning the building up of Zion in the la[st] [page covered]  days & thought many of those prophesies alluded to us in our pres  ent position such as Zion should be a city sought & not forsa[ken] [page covered]  & that the munition of rocks should be a defence unto them  the Lord sware that their corn & wine should no more be given   to their enemies, & that the house of God should be built up[on] [page covered]   the tops of the mountain &c he had the spirit of preachi[ng] [page covered]  & we were all edifyed, when he closed Dr Richards read a   letter from the commanding officer of the Battalion who   had gone with them to the Pacific spoke in the highest term[s] [page covered]  of praise of them in all their procedings. Also a letter   from Captain Hunt on the 3rd of Feb was read. Br Kimb[all] [page covered]  made some remarks concerning our traiding with the India[ns] [page covered]  that we ought to harken to council & keep our amunitio[n] [page covered]  & not trade with them at all at present the Indians left   our encampment in the night & whether they stole any thing   or not we do not yet know. Congregation came together aga[in] [page covered]  at 2 oclok the Bishops broke bread to the congregation Dr Richa[rds] [page covered]  read the revelation given at winter quarters & the whole [illegible] [page covered]     
 recieved it with a universal vote Br A Lyman addressed the meeting   at length & spoke to edifycation after which some business matters  were brought up & it was decided to commence building our houses   for those who were to tarry through the winter of Dobies instd  of timber & put the buildings together in stead of a stockade   for a defence against the Indians. And all oxen that are to   go back this season should start one week from tomorrow   & various orther matters were attended a vote was taken to   cease entirely traiding with the Indians & have no intercourse  with them at all. we also decided to form all the encampme[n]ts  into one. In the evening the Twelve met & decided for Br Bens[on]  [page covered]  go back & meet the camp, & 3 others go with him to get the mail &   [page covered] [b]ring word concerning them.      August 2, 1847 ~ Monday      2nd [FIGURES] Br Benson starts for the camp to day I wrote a letter to  Father Woodruff by him we commenced to day to lay out the City  Plott commiencing with the Temple Block, we formed our whole enca  mpment to day into one circle, on forming our temple block of   40 acres it was so large we held a council to see if it was not wisdom  to reduce it one half the size several expressed their opinion upon   the subject, G. A. Smith believed if we done it we should be sorry   afterwards would rather enlarge than diminish it, Br Kimball though[t] [page covered]  if we let it be as it was & set it out to shrubery we should not   be sorry Br A Lyman said G. A. Smith had spoke his mind &  all our minds seemed to run in about the same channel, the   President said we could eisier diminish than enlarge it afterwar[d] [page covered]  & finally decided to let it remain as it was, we also walked   upon a peace of table land above east of the camp & took a view   of the table city ground which presented a grand prospect to  our view. In the evening I went to the warm sulpher springs  & bathed with Dr Richards G. A. Smith & others      August 3, 1847 ~ Tuesday      3rd Our ten sowed our buck wheat to day a little over one bushel  on two acres, O Pratt one third, G. A. Smith one third, & W Woodruff   one third, mine to be divided between A. O. Smoot Br Dewey &   Aphek Woodruff. All the encampment are busiy to day in farming,   laying out the city, preparing for making dobys lime &c      I recieved of Br [blank] Case 19 lbs of Iron at 25 cts per lb $4.75  I visited the farming grounds gardings &c & found things coming up  well such as corn, beans, potatoes &c I went in the evening to the  warm spring to bathe with Dr Richards      August 4, 1847 ~ Wednesday      4th I met in council this morning with the Twelve to set upon   case brought up by Br Gribble concerning improper conduct   of one or two men with his wife there was contradictory test  emony & the case was finally dismissed for the time being. we   again met in council concerning the size of the temple square  it was finally considered we could not do justice to 40 acres to   begin with & finally concluded to confine the Temple & gard[ing]   to 10 acres. After council I rode with G. A. Smith to the mountai[n]  to find some timber to put us up a small building for a Store House &   men also commenced to day to prepare ground to commenced ma[king]  Dobys for puting up a fort     
 August 5, 1847 ~ Thursday      [5th] [page covered] [FIGURE] As we were under the necessity of returning soon & wanted some   place to unload our goods that we had with us & those that were   coming up we thought it best to go into the mountain & draw out logs &   build us some cabins as the doby houses might not be ready Brs   Young & Kimball had commenced drawing out logs for their build-  ings Br G. A. Smith & myself concluded to join our effortts together   & do what we could, so I took my ax this morning & in company   with G. A. Smith went to the mountain about 6 miles we had sever-  al men with us to assist in choping we found a grove of fir trees   that we thought would answer well we had to make a road to it   & bridges across the creek I some dreaded the job, for it was a   hard one and I do not exercise the prudence that I ought when   I take hold of hard labour but do more than is good for me  I however commenced choping down trees & done much   more work during the day than any other man on the ground  we choped drew out more logs more logs than to build one house   16 foot square & drew home to the fort 25 of them I blistered   up my hands & was vary weary at night distance of the day 14 m      August 6, 1847 ~ Friday      6 I arose early this moring quite sore with my labour I went   into the valley for my horses & we could not find them. some   Indians had been camp this morning or rather in the night   & left again & we supposed they had taken a drove of horses   with them so we sent our horsman & drove in all the horses in the   valley to see how many was gone, but much to our joy we found all   of our horses was safe which increased our confidence in the Ind-  ians that were around us, I had rode about 8 miles without a   saddle which was wors than labour, we however got our teams   together & started for the mountains with 5 teams, & 4 teams   went also for Dr Richards to draw logs for him, I sadled my   horse & took my ax, & went to the timber before them, & before   they arived I cut 5 large fir trees & when the teams came   up the men assisted to cut up the trees & draw them out &   load them, & we laboured exceding hard all day & we drew   home during the day 52 logs great & small, except one load that   we left by the wayside untill morning, this made 77 logs in   two days that we cut & drew home, in two days we got timber   sufficient for two buildings each of us one but I had lab-  oured so hard during the two days I could hardly stand upon   my feet I went to my waggon & flung myself upon my   bed to rest. I had not been on the bed but a short time before   Br Kimball called upon me & informed me that the Twelve   were going soon to the water to be baptized for the remission   of their sins to set an example to the Church as the[y] would be   called upon on Sunday morning to bye baptized by the Twelve   for all those that wished, we considerd this a duty & privlege as we   come into a glorious valley to locate & build a temple & build up   Zion we felt like renewing our covenant before the Lord and   each other.      We soon repaired to the water & President  Brigham Young went down into the water & baptized all his   Brethren the Twelve that were with him by burying them in the   water He also confirmed us in the Church & sealed upon us our   apostleship & all the keys, powers, & blessings belonging to that office  Br Heber C.

 August 7, 1847 ~ Saturday      7th I arose this morning quite weary with my labours of yesterday  I spent the day mostly in assisting Br Fowler to start on a journey to   the Bay of Francisco to get his family I made arangments with   Capt Brown to furnish him with a horse to ride & put him up prov-  isions to last him to fort Hall & there they would get supplys. In   [FIGURE] In the afternoon the Twelve went onto the Temple Block & picked   out there inheritances President Young took a block east of the   temple & runing S.E. to settle his friends around him. Br H. C. Kimball   took a block North of the Temple will settle his friends on the north  O pratt south of the Temple joining the temple Block & runs south.   W. Woodruff took a block cornering on the Temple lot at the S. west   corner joining O Pratts block & will settle his friend's on the south  A Lyman took a block 40 rods below or west of w, woodruff   Bolock & runs s west of the Temple to settle his friends G. A. Smith   took a block joining the Temple on the west & runs due west. it   was supposed Br Young Richards would take his inheritances on the east   near Br. Young none others of the Twelve were present in the camp Br   Benson had gone back to meet the camp & 3 of the quorum was in winter   quarters.      During the evening in companes with the Twelve I went to one   of the pure streams of cold water that runs through the City &   H C Kimball baptized 55 members of the camp for the remission of   their sins who were confirmed under the hands of Presidents Young   O Pratt, W Woodruff, A Lyman, & G. A. Smith B Young was mouth   in confirming the greatest number of them      August 8, 1847 ~ Sunday      8th Sunday morning at 6 oclock the Bishops repaired with the Twelve   [FIGURE] to the streams of water for the purpose of baptizing & confirming the   whole camp who had not been since we came into the valley  we felt it our privilege to be baptized & to baptize the Camp of Israel   for the remission of our sins & to renew our covenants before the   Lord, Brothers Lewis, Godard, Everett Shumway Snow & H C Kimball   baptized & the Twelve confirmed them there were 224 baptized   & confirmed this morning 99 of which I confirmed with my   own hands making 288 in all that have been baptized in the camp   during the last 3 days. The camp assembled as usual at 10 oclok for   meeting and was addressed as usual by H. C. Kimball who had the spirit   of speaking unto edifycation I followed him and was never blessed with   greater liberty of speach in addressing a congregation I was edifyed myself   & those that herd. In the afternoon we met again & pertook of   the sacrament Br Lorenzo Young addressed the people & was followed   by Br Brigham Young who was feeble in health, he gave good council   & we were edefyed, at the close of the meeting 110 men were called up   to go onto the Doby yard 70 volunteered & they thought that woul[d]   answer for a commencment. [FIGURE]      The following are some of the remarks made by w, woodruff [in]  his address to the Saints in the fore part of the day written by Th[omas]   Bullock clerk. I have been much edifyed in the teaching giv[en]   by Elder, ^Kimball^ & have reflected much since I came into this valley, con[cer]  ning our situation, our calling, & the work that is required at ou[r]   hands. And the words of one of the Apostles will apply well to [our]   case "that when we have done the will of God we have need of   patience that we may obtain the blessing's & though it tarry lo[ng]   we should obtain it if we continued faithful" Of all   people that ever lived we have the greatest reason to be fait[hful]     
 & exercise Patience & not be weary in well doing for we have   the greatest work to perform & blessings promised accordingly.  The day has come when the Lord has set his hand with full pur-  pose of heart to esstablish his Kingdom on the earth, gather Israel   build up Zion & Jerrusalem make an end of sin & cause all   nations to bow the Knee & every tongue to confess tha[t] Jesus is   the Lord & has a right to reign on the earth and ye are the   people ye Elders of Israel & Latter Day Saints that are moved   upon & called & chosen to do this work, who is sufficient for   these things, & what manner of persons ought ye to be. I rejoice   that I enjoy the society of so many of the Saints this day in this   glorious valley which has not been pelluted by the ungodly   gentiles & that I can speak with freedom without being trampled   by wicked men. the difference in the society tbetween the Saints   & the gentiles in the United States can ownly be contrasted betw-  een Heaven & Hell in comparison for let an elder of this church   start from New York & travel to Saint Louis & let the people know   who he is & he would be in Hell all the time & there is a cause for   this a Prophet Seer & Revelater. Patriarchs & Apostles have been raised   up in there midst, the Church & kingdom of God has been planted   among them, the gospel preached & salvation freely offered unto all &   what have they done, they have stoned the Prophets & killed them  poured out their blood like water upon the earth, have burned their   dwellings & given their goods to the flames, have driven the Apostles   with the keys of Eternal life & salvation with the entire Church   & kingdom of God out of their midst into the wilderness & the mountais   yets they have turned the last key that has sealed & locked fast their   condemnation that lingereth not & there damnation that slumber  eth not. And this is the reason why they are full of hell & desire to   destroy every thing that retainets any portion of the spirit of the spirit   of God. But if it requires all the martered Saints in Heaven from   Rig[h]teous Abel to Joseph to go forth from the temple in Heaven   & [p]our out all the vials of the last plagues upon the United   States & open the seals upon them in order to avenge the blood   of the Prophets & Saints which they have spilt, it will be done   for that blood shall spedily be avenged. Yea vary spedily  The Prophet Joseph, The Twelve Apostles,, with many of the   Elders of Israel & Saints have been called to pass through scenes   of sufferings & privations, that would have discouraged an Allexan  der, they have had to combat earth and Hell, wicked men & devils,   sickness & death, burnings Drivings & persecutions, but have  we ben discouraged no the greater the difficulties the   more we have been stimulated to action, what has sus  tained us & inspired us to action in the midst of these   difficulties. We have been upheld by the power of God that   we might fulfill his purposes. Our spirits have been stired up by the   spilt blood of the Martered Prophets which still cries from the ground   [to] [page covered] heaven for vengance & will not rest neither let us untill it is  avenged, we have also been moved upon by the spirits of our   [f]athers [page covered] & Progenitors whose bodies have lain in the dust for many   generatons, who recieved not the gospel in the flesh not having it  [p]roffered [page covered] unto them, but are now waiting for the redemption of their   bodies after salvation shall be sealed upon them through the instru  mentality of their sons who should embrace the gospel in the fulness   of times, we are also moved upon by the Holy Ghost to accomplish the   great work of the last days & fulness of times in preparing the ear[th] [page torn]     
 for the reign of Christ, & to fulfill the promises which was made  to the Ancient Prophets & Patriarch which promises they drew from   the Heavens by their faith & faithfulness before the Lord & saw the   work that lies before us by the spirit of inspiration revelation dreams   & the visions of Heaven. Thus it has been that a combination   of causes of eternal & important consequence has stimulated the Proph[et]   Apostles & Elders to action untill they have resolved in their hearts that   for Zions sake they would not hold their peace & for Jerrusalem sake   they would not rest, untill their righteousness goes forth as brightness   & Salvation as a Lamp that burneth. Yea the time has come for the   Lord to esstablish his kingdom on the earth & to make a short work of it  & overthrow the Kingdom of the devel, for He has held dominion on  the earth for many generations & in one instance undertook to   claim his right to all the Kingdoms of the world before the Lord wh[en]  He showed the Savior all the kingdoms of the world & proffered to   give them to him if He would fall down & worship him, when in   fact the Poor Devil did did not own one foot of land on the earth  I feel also that the time has come when we can no more preach salvation   to those of the gentiles who have rejected the Prophets & killed them &   cast the saints & the gospel out of their midst, the last time I was  through the United States I could not preach salvation to the people   but I could have the spirit of God to preach damnation to them fo[r]  they were worthy I tried to preach a gospel sermon in the Temple   in Nauvoo to many of the world who were present but it was hard   work to do it. But I could tell them about their spilling the   blood of the Prophets & the judgments that must follow them  & that they had not got done with Joseph Smith but he would yet r[ule]   in judgment against them & condemn them.      I will close by relating a circumstance that transpired when I was in  the eastern States on my return ofrom England I went to the State of   Connecticut (my native place) to get my father to bring to Zion. I  thought if Joseph was justifyed in giving commandment to have hi[s]   bones taken to be buried in Canaan, that I was justifyed In taking my   living father & gathering him with the Saints & while at his house  was visited by my Fathers Sister Aunt Wheeler who was naturly a   good woman & a strenuous Prysbeterian while conversing about our lea[ving]   & going so far off she asked me with tears in her eyes if I suppo[sed]  we could find any Christian society to associate with, I replyed for  Gods sake & our sake I hope not, she gazed at me with amazement  & wondered why I should feel so, I replyed that the Christians of   this generation in the United States had persecuted us to all intents &   purposes had burned our dwellings, given our goods to the flames   had murdered our Brethren, Sistiers, wives & children had marte[red]   our Prophets, Patriarchs, & Apostles & driven the remainder of   us from their midst & should we now desire their society & see[k]   their religion? No I would rather be in the midst of the griselly b[ears]  of the rocky mountains, or mingle with the society of the Savages [in]  the forest, than to longer mingle with such Christians or longer   bear the fruits of their religion      August 9, 1847 ~ Monday      9th I spent the day in making a saw pit      August 10, 1847 ~ Tuesday      10th I spent the day in preparing timber for our dwellings in the for[t]  we decided by council to enclose one block of 10 acres with dobys &   buildings as a fort or fortification.      August 11, 1847 ~ Wednesday      [11th] [page folded] I spent this day in framing timber the company also comm[enced]  [l]aying [page folded] their wall on one side of the lot one doby & a half thick 2 [1/2]     
 [gr]ace [page torn] for grace. when Brother Joseph received the Priesthood   he did not recived all at once, but he was a prophet Seer & Revela[tor] [page torn]  before he recieved the fulness of the Priesthood & keys of the kingd[om] [page torn]  he first recieved the Aronick Priesthood & Keys from under the hand  of John the Baptisk. He then had not power to lay on hands to confirm   the Church but afterwards he recieved the Patriarchal or Melchisidick   Priesthood from under the hands of Peter James & John who were   of the Twelve Apostles & were the Presidency when the other Apostl[es]  were absent, from those Apostles Joseph Smith recieved every key [FIGURE]  power, blessing, & Privilege of the highest authority of the Melchezedick   Priesthood ever committed to man on the earth which they held  some have had fears that we had not power to get revelations since   the death of Joseph, but I want this subject from this time forth   to be forever set at rest and I want this Church to understand   from this day henceforth & forever that an apostle is the highest   office & authority that there is in the Church & kingdom of God   on the earth. from whom did Joseph recieve his authority from   just such men as sit around me here (pointing to the Twelve   Apostles that sat with him) Peter James & John were Apostles &   there was no noise about their being seers & Revelators though those   gifts were among them. Joseph Smith gave unto me & my brethr[en]   the Twelve all the Priesthood keys Power & Authority which he ha[d]   And those are powers which belong to the Apostleship. In Joseph[s]   day we had to ordain Patriarchs could we ordain men to Author[ity]   greater than we held ourselves No. But it is necessary to have Patria[rchs]   to bless the People that they may have blessings by the spirit of prop[hecy]   & Revelation sealed upon their heads & their posterity & know what   awaits their posterity Father Smith was the Seignor Patriarch in the   Church & first Patriarch in our day & afterwards Hiyram was th[e]   seignor Patriarch for his father sealed it upon his head but was   there Power & Authority different from all Patriarchs in the   church No they were all alike in their authority in blessing. Elijah is  spoken of in the Bible that he should come in the last days to sta   turn the hearts of the fathers to the children & the children to their   fathers, the fulfillment of this scripture is manifest in esstablishing   the kingdom of God & Priesthood on the earth in the last days & those   who hold the keys of the priesthood & sealing power have the spirit  & power of Elijah & it is necessary in order to redeem our dead &   save our children there is much more importance attached to this than   Parents are aware of. In the loss of this child of Brother Crows that was   drowned I felt that I could weep in sorrow if I gave way to my feeli[ngs]   for I realize it is a loss to the parents to loose little children. it is true al[l]   children are saved there names are written in the Lambs book of li[fe]  which was the case with every spirit that takes a tabernacle on   this earth. their names were written there before the world was   made, & will there ever remain untill they sin against the Holy Gho[st]   it will then be blotted out no more to be recorded forever. But not  withstanding this can brother Crow get that child again or any oth[er]   person their children except their is sumthing done for them on the   earth by their Parents, No they would not, they would go to God who  gave them but the parents on the earth would not have them, the   Parents framed the body to be sure but the Lord gave the spirit  what is the body good for without the spirit. what then can [be]   done, I will tell you a man that has embraced the gospel must [be]   some one who has the Priesthood & keys & power of Elijah, & mu[st]   [att]end to ordinances for that child, even must be baptized fo[r it]  [as well] as to have it sealed to him & through t[he] [2 illegible words]

Br Brigham Young took towo tier of blocks   South through the City.

Great Bason, North America      August 15, 1847 ~ Sunday      [1]5th [FIGURES] Sunday The Camp of Israel met as usal at 10 oclok   & was addressed by President Young in an interesting   manner upon an interesting subject much to our edifycation.   The following are some of the remarks made by President Young. I am   going to day sto speak upon the subject of the Patriarchal Priesthood &   by request of Br Crow say sumthing upon the death of his child that   was drowned the other day. I hope to speak so as to be understood  There is a reality in eternal things as much as in the things of time   which we daily see with our eyes when a man has a dream or   [v]ision of eternal things it is an evidence of its truth as much as   [t]hough he saw it with his own eyes in one sens of the word. The   Lord has hid from man the things that He knew before He   [c]ame in the flesh that he might walk by faith & prove himself   [w]hile here. The Lord converses with men on the earth in the   [f]orm of a servent & by visions & dreams &c but He never appea[rs to]   man in the flesh in the fulness of his glory, for He is as a   [c]onsuming fire & a mortal body would perish in an instant  The Priesthood is again restored on the earth to bring back [illegible]  [w]hich [2 illegible words] we do not recieve all at once but [2 illegible words]     
 [page torn] [c]laim his child in the morning of the resurrection & the Lord   will give it up to him. I had my children sealed to me in the   [page torn] [t]emple except one that died & that I shall leave in the hands of   [page torn] [t]he Lord, untill I have another opportunity. As soon as we get   up some doby houses for our families we shall go to work to   build another Temple & as soon as a place is prepared we shal[l]   commence the Endowments long before the Temple is built &   we shall take time, & each step the Saints take let them take time   enough about it to understand it. evry thing at Nauvoo went with   a rush we had to build the Temple with the trowel in one hand &   the sword in the other & mobs were upon us all the while and   many crying out O the temple cant be built, I told them it should   be built, this Church should not fall & the Lord said if we did not  build it we should be rejected as a Church with our dead why did   He say it because the Saints were becoming slothful & covetous & would   spend their means upon fine houses for themselves before they would   put it into a House for the Lord. But we went at it & finished   it & turned it over into the hands of the Lord in spite of earth & Hell   & the Brethren was so faithful at it that we laboured day [and] night to give   them their endowments. The Children want to be sealed to their Parents   & Parents to their Children, that they may have blessings in eternity that   they will stand in need of. God promised to Abraham that his seed  should be as numerous as the stars of Heaven & the sands of the seashore &   to his seed there should be no end this of course would continue   through all Eternity, the same blessing is upon our heads if we are faith  ful for our eyes have not seen, our ears herd neither entered into our   hearts the great things that God has in store for us. & when I look   upon the great work the Elders of Israel have to perform & look  around upon them & see them vain & foolish, it makes me sorrowful  they forget their Calling. O ye Elders of Israel think for a moment   what manner of persons ought ye to be, men who hold the priesthood   & keys of salvation & have power to go to the Nations of the Earth &   & say Here Gentleman & Ladies I have salvation for you & power to exhalt   you to Celestial Glory, or if you reject it to seal you unto damnation  it is no trifling affair to have power put into your hand to deal with   [t]he Eternal destinies of the sons & daughters of Adam that form   the Nations of the earth. While in the Temple at Nauvoo we voted   to cut off the gentiles who had rejected the gospel & killed the prophets  & it was recorded on earth & if it is recorded in heaven that Nation wi[ll]   go down quickly. Many other interesting & important items were presented   by President Young much to our edifycation. meeting was dismissed &   met again at 2 oclok & was addressed in a vary edifying manner   by O Pratt, & treated upon the same principles spoken off by Br   Young. Among his remarks he said, that as all the ordinances of the   gospel administered by the world since the Aposticy of the Church   was illegal, in like manner was the marriage cerimony illegal and all   the world who had been begotton through the illegal marriage, were   bastards & not sons & hence they had to enter into the law of adopti[on] [ink spot]  & be adopted into the Priesthood in order to become sons & legal hei[rs]   [o]f salvation.      Erastus Snow followed & spoke much to our edi  [f]ycation after which meeting was dismissed.      President Young met with the company who were to start back   in the morning with the ox teams there were over 60 in number   & gave good instruction to them, many of the Battalion deposited there   [g]uns with President Young for safe keeping

[FIGURE] distance of the day 28      September 4, 1847 ~ Saturday      [FIGURE]  4th We travled to little Sandy 8 miles & to our joy   we met with Capt Sessions fifty here we found   Parly Pratt fifty of company I dined with Br Abbott   & family, while here I recieved a letter from Br   J Ferguson from the Army, in the afternoon the   quorum of the Twelve met in Council & one of the   most interesting Councils we ever held together on the   earth. In the begining of the Council two of the quor  um was reproved sharply for undo[i]ng what the   majority of the quorum had done in the organizing   of the camps for travelling. At first it was not recieved   but afterwards the error was recieved & seen, confession   made & much teaching given by the President &   the power of God rested upon us & our hearts   melted & our eyes in tears. The President said  if he did not tell us our faults we would be destroyed   but if he told us of them & reproved us we would   live in love & our hearts be semented together   Brothers Parley P Pratt & J Taylor had been to England & done a good   work had returned to winter quarters, & there done wrong by   disorganizing the two divisions & companies that the quorum o[f]   the Twelve had spent the whole winter in organizing & which   was also governed by revelation, Br Parley took the lead in th[e]  matter & entirly disregarded our organisation & mixed the co[mp]  anies all up Br Young chustized him for his course & taught us   principle said that when we set a part one or more of the   Twelve to go & do a certain piece of work they would be   blessed in doing that & the quorum would back up what they   did, but when one or more of the quorum interfere with t[he]   work of the majority of the quorum they burn their fingers   & do wrong when the majority of the quorum of the 12 plant [a]  stake of Zion & esstablish a President over the Stake & appoin[t]   a High Council there has the minority of the Twelve one or mor[e]   any right to go & interfere with those Councils? No unless they   should get corrupt & do wrong then it would be the duty     
 [page torn] [o]f any one of the quorum of the Twelve to show them their error   & teach them what was right, & should the majority of those coun-  cils get corrupt & try to lead asstray the people it would then be the   duty of any one of the Twelve to disannul those councils & call upon   the people to sustain him & appoint a new one but while the Councils   are trying to do right it would be the duty of the Twelve who might be   with them to assist them in carrying out those views that the majority   of the Twelve had esstablished. The quorum of the Twelve all   decided that Br Pratt had committed an error in not carrying out the   organization as esstablished by the Twelve Br Pratt at first had   a hard spirit afterwords repented & confessed his fault & the Power   of God rested upon President Young & the whole quorum, President   Young said that he felt Eternity upon him & was weighed down to the   earth with this work & that Br Kimble felt the weight of it more   than any other man except himself each one of the quorum exp  ressed their feelings upon the subject & we all had a good time  Br Young said he should chastize Br Parley or any one of the  quorum as much as he pleased when they were out of the wasy &   they could not help themselves but he done it for their good   & ownly done it when constrained to do it by the power of God   Br. H. C. Kimball addressed by [br] Young & wished him to rest as much   as possible & let his brethren bear his burthens He said he wanted Br   Brigham to save himself for he was waring down. I feel tender toward you   & want you to live, & If I or my Brethren do wrong tell us of it   & we will repent. Br Brigham said there was not a better set   of men on the earth than the Twelve & he intended to chastize   them when they need it that they might be saved & love him & stick   by him. we all felt good to be there for the Lord was with us      September 5, 1847 ~ Sunday      5th We travled to day to the springs. Here to our joy we met   with three fifties, Br A. O. Smoot hundred, and Robinson   fifty of Gen Rich company I here met with Father Woodruff &   the Company Br Smoot & many from our ward which I was truly   glad to see.

In the afternoon the Twelve met in coun-  cil being eight of us and A O Smoot related to the quorum the   circumstances of John Taylor taking from John Benbow over   $300 for his sister & Br Taylors opinion was there could be no appeal   in the case to any other Authority. The Council voted that John   Benbow have a rehearing before the quorum of the Twelve if he   wished it. Also voted that the High Council in the salt lake city take   charge of the property on its arival there which was taken from   John Benbow, resolved also that there could be an appeal from   there decision to the majority of the quorum of the Twelve.

Early this morning a company of hunters crossed the  river to get some buffalo cows in a herd near by, in the chase Br   Mathews horse fell with him but did not hurt him, the others continued   on & killed one cow & two black tailed deer while this was going on  the Twelve with many others went up the creek to see if they could  get the bears but we could not find them I came in sight of 3  deer & shot 3 times at them with a coarse sighted rifles & shot over  them evry time Brother Barnham shot one of them I went a little  above & saw about 50 Antilope in a flock feeding on the plain I got  within 30 rods of one of them & shot him dead in his tracks I brought   my horse up to put him onto his back to pack him into Camp and I  laboured hard one hour before I could get the horse willing to let me   put the animal on his back I was 5 miles from camp & walked & led  my horse in the antilop was fat. We then harnessed up & drove  9 miles & camped on Fourchebaise Creek 9 miles      September 20, 1847 ~ Monday      20th We travled 30 miles we crossed dry creek, little timber, & camped  Big timber, did not get through untill 9 oclok at night had great difficulty in  finding grass as the other camps had eat it off. A boy by the name of Judson  Persons did not get into Camp but lay out 10 miles from camp. 30 miles  [FIGURE]      September 21, 1847 ~ Tuesday      21st A cloudy morning. At about 9 oclock the call was made to   get up the horses. I started for the horses which was in the timber abou[t]  half a mile from Camp I got about two thirds of the way to the hors[es]  when one of the most exciting seenes wcommenced I ever witnessed  I herd the report of several ^guns^ in quick succession and herd the guard cr[y]     
 Indians, Indians, And in less than a minute the timber & bluffs were lined   with mounted Indians charging with all speed upon our guard, horses &  camp they shot at two or three of the guard but missed them they  took one of the guard & tryed to carry him off on a horse. He knocked one  of them down with his fist & got away from them some of the  Brethren snaped their guns at them but they did not go off, as  soon as I herd the report of the guns, & the cry of Indians & saw   them driving off our horses & gathering thick & fast upon every  hand & being without either horse or arms I run to the camp with   all speed & gave the alarm & called upon all to gather their arms &  mount their horses. Brothers Kimball, Rockwood, Mathews, & ^99^  several others sprung onto their horses with their guns & pistols & run  to stop the horses which the Indians were taking away one party of   Indians had driven 5 or 6 Horses & Mules over the Hills Br Kimball  took after them. two Indians had gone over the Bluff with my  Horse & Mule Brother Rockwood took after them. At the same  time about 20 horses came rushing toward Camp which the Indians  had frightend Br Young with great exhertion with the assistance  of one or two other Brethren succeding in stoping them & getting  them into camp. As soon as I arived in camp I opened my trunk   took out my belt containing 8 pistol shots & harnessed it onto  myself as quick as possible put a saddle & bridle onto a broken  down horse for the want of a better one & I mounted without   spur or whip & started for the chase after my own horses. I   could not travel vary fast over the rough ground & bluffs on a   poor horse but I went as fast as I could. As soon as I left camp I  began to rise the bluffs I saw Indians gathering thicker & faster upon  every hand & began to close in between me & the camp. As I passed  by one Indian he was priming his gun. But I continued the chase  As soon as my horse & mule got over their fright & got out of   sight of camp, they tryed to return to camp & troubled the Indians   about driving them and Brother Rockwood soon came near   them and one stoped & met him when they found they were  overtaken & professed friendship the other still tried to drive off  the horses Br Rockwood fired a pistol at him & he run & left  the horses & the other Indian left also & Rockwood son soon started my   horses towards ^me^ I soon came up to his assistance & some other Brethren also  came up & assisted me in ketching them & while I was doing this near  40 Indians surrounded Br Kimball who started for the other  horses. some of the Brethren started to his assistance after I had  started for camp with my horses. Indians were also upon evry  side of me untill I got into camp I secured my horses insid the  camp and by this time about 150 warriors had gatherd to gether  close to our camp all dressed in the greatest stile for a war charge  and the old chif began to address to the top of his horse voice  the Indians and also our camp, tlelling us they were good Sioux and   they thought we were Crows or snakes. When they found they could not  get any more of our horses & 3 had been retaken which they stole they then   professed friendship there was 11 horses taken by the Indians they number  ed at about 200 warriors on the ground & well mounted & their was not over  20 of our men including the guard that was engaged in any way in stoping  the horses, or saving them, or retaking those that were stolen. Br Gould   took one Indian horse & all and another Indian brought back Thomas   Woolsays horse which was among the stolen & exchanged him for the Ind  ians horse, this with my two horses were the ownly ones retaken during the  skirmish. But when the Indians gatherd before the camp they saw we     
 as a body were armed & that we knew them & had fed them & treated   them kindly while on our way to the valley. the old Chief then proposed   that we smoke the pipe of peace. And also said that if our chief pointing   to President Young would go to their Camp they would smoke with him  & give him up the horses which his men had taken but Brother Young did   not feel well & we did not think it prudent for him to go, while in this   conversation Br Kimball who had been out on the chase after the horses   returned bare headed (having droped his hat) was accompanied by Br Benson   & in riding into camp rushed his horse through the midst of the Indians   & they fearing some treachery or that he was an enemy coming upon them   in their rear, they instantly leaped upon their horses, scattered & rushed from   the camp some runing into the creek all appeared in great fright. But as soon   as they saw there was no evil at hand they returned & took their places &   had a harty laugh at their fright. Br Kimball volenteered to accompanied   the Chief into his camp in the place of Br Young that we might get our   horses I volunteered & also Stephen Markham to go with Br Kimball  on the expedition so we three mounted our horses & set out accompanied   by a Frenchman (who could speak a little sioux language) & the Indians to   find their Camp; they told us it was one mile we travled 7 miles over   Bluffs & valleys & came in sight of their Camp some 3 miles from us   moving towards us. so we called a halt & waited for them to come up  they came & pitched about 100 lodges & their was about 600 Indians   many women & children & they brought with them about 1000 horses &   mules nearly all of them we supposed were stolen from emigrants &   & other tribes. their encampment presented quite a grand, interesting & amusing   scenery among their horses we readily discoverd ours which was stolen   the night we camped we camped with Br Grants Company we lost   49 that night which they had among their number. The old Chief called   the war Chiefs & placed them on his left hand & ourselves on his right & set down   upon the grass & filled a long pipe with Kennickenick & smoked & passed it   to his Chiefs they smoked & passed it to us we also smoked he then pointed to   us to pick out our horses which we undertook to do but found it no easy   task to pick out 7 or 8 horses scattered through one thousand others for   one or two miles up & down the creek however after a laborious search   we got all but two that was stolen this morning. We then spoke to him   about the 49 horses which they had stolen from us before, they ackn  owledged they had got the horses & gave us some incouragement of   letting us have them when they got to Laramie but would not let us   have them then they however let us have one of them ownly the  brethren brought about 3 bushels of salt as a present to him we then   returned to camp with our horses, which ended the business of the   day the Camp did not move but few rods I travled about 18 m  It rained some during the night      September 22, 1847 ~ Wednesday      22nd A cool rainy morning it seemed to be the equenoxial stomr tho[u]gh  not vary tedious we thought it wisdom to leave the ground &   continue our journey we travled 18 miles & camped on Bitter   creek we had but little grass but plenty of water 18 mile      September 23, 1847 ~ Thursday      23rd we travled to day 30 miles & camped at night at the wa[rm]   spring we did not get through untill 9 oclok at night the moon  shone most briliantly we took our horses forward to the spring to   water them & then drove our waggons on the South road half a mile.   Camped for the night found some bunch grass for our horses 30 m      September 24, 1847 ~ Friday      24 we rode to Laramie Br Young Kimball Benson & myself dined   with Mr Burdow we talked with him about our stolen horses   He informed us that our company with the ox teams lost every horse     
 they had, but they had got every them all back but 5 He gave us some   encouragement of sending an interpeter with us to get our horses. we   crossed the Platt & pitched our camp about 3 miles from the fort   during the evening President Young called the camp together   and addressed them at some length. Appointed 10 men to go & visit the Ind-  ians to get the stolen horses & about 40 men to follow after to assist in   case of necessity Br Young gave much instruction upon principle   & improving upon manners, temper, & interest in the general welfare of   the Church & kingdom of God distance of the day 12 m      September 25, 1847 ~ Saturday      25th The Companies prepared themselves this morning to start on their   expedition. the first company of 10 men commanded y Col Mark-  ham started by 9 oclok the other Company numbered 25 men comma  nded by Br Benson started at 10 oclock Brs Young & Kimball went to   the fort it was not long before both companies returned as they ascerta-  ined at the fort that a man had gone forward to inform them of   our coming & to have them cash up their horses. we also recieved   word in the evening that Johnson & Little had returned on the road   back, had fallen in with Comodore Stockton who was from the   Bay of Francisco accompanied with 40 men going to the States Brs  Young & Kimball made a purchase of some 40 buffalo robes   which were some damaged & unmerchantable they everaged about   $1.50 each, they also bought 3 cows at $15 each. during the afterno-  on I went out on patrool picket guard      September 26, 1847 ~ Sunday      26th Sunday Brs Johnson & Little reached the fort this morn-  ing with 2 other Brethren & brought into our camp 10 horses which  they had drove on west to meet us with. we were truly glad to   see them & their hosses [horses] to as they would be some help to us   as theye Indians had taken so many of our horses that we had  as much as we could do to get along & our horses are growing   poor daily Brs Young & Kimball & others dined with Comodore   Stockton at the fort I spent the fore part of the day washing   my clothes rubed the skin of my fingers into the flesh we   harnessed up at 3 oclok & drove 3 miles & camped on the platt   many in Camp are out of both bread & meat I have divided   my bread & meat untill I am nearly out myself. 3 m      September 27, 1847 ~ Monday      27th We travled 8 miles & fed & took breakfast we then travled 12 miles   & camped for the night on the bank of the Platt in the midst of   a plenty of grass & a grove of cottonwood near a good harbor for   both deer & Indians we saw several deer and a large drove of  antelope it was a warm plesant day we mowed grass for our horses   to stand by overnight 20 miles      September 28, 1847 ~ Tuesday      28th we drove 8 miles & took breakfast we saw about 50 Indians mak-  ing off towards the bluffs on the South side of the river we drove   12 miles & camped on the Platt 5 miles west of scotts Bluffs 20 m  A drove of antilope run through our camp & we killed two of them      September 29, 1847 ~ Wednesday      29th We passed Scotts Bluffs & took breakfast we saw a large com  pany travling on the opposite side of the river we could not tell whether  they were Indians or Capt Stockton & Co they pitched their lodges   about 10 miles back of us. we killed one Buffalo Bull to day 22 miles      September 30, 1847 ~ Thursday      30th we travled 20 miles & camped on the Bank of the Platt   Mr Bewshaw the Indian traider camped on the opposite Bank. of   our Brethren got some meat of[f] him He will come over with his   Indians & surround some buffaloo & kill for uu [us] in the morning     
 October 1, 1847 ~ Friday      OCT 1st 1847 A warm plesant day A good share of the  Camp are out of bread & meat & they are preparing to go out  to day to surround a herd of buffalo & get some cows a company  of Indians came over to go to the hunt & expected us to go with them  2nd we were afterwards informed but we did not go untill several hour[s]  afterwards we then went in search of them but found neither  Indians or dead buffalo they came in at night & brought some   meat with them for themselves but none for us. Comodore Stockton  arived at night & camped with us or nearby & said he would like  to accompany us      October 2, 1847 ~ Saturday      2nd we were informed this morning that Comodore Stockton  had changed his mind & concluded to go down on the north side  of the river Accordingly he crossed over with his troop our company  bought some half a dozen horses of Rashaw we then started on the  Journey, the Brethren killed a fat buffalo cow neare the road we  stoped the camp & dressed the meat & took it along which detained  the camp some we travled 13 miles & camped on the Platt. In the  evening Br Markham & myself went out to see if we could get any  buffalo cows we saw some of the Brethren dressing a young boll  which they had killed we could not find any cows and we would  not shoot bulls though they came so near me I stoned them off  with stones I was quite surprised to see with what expertness the buffalo  would clime the mountains & rocks they would go in places whare  horned cattle would never think of going, some steps in the rocks in the[ir]  path was more than 6 feet high in perpendicular rocks. we shot a wolf  a deer, stoned a bull & got neither of them & returned to camp 13 m      October 3, 1847 ~ Sunday      3rd Sunday I lef camp as daylight was appearing in company with  Luke Johnson, for the purpose of getting ofsome meat the wolves   that had rent the air through the night with their howls was   dispersing in all directions as we passed along mounted upon our horses  they were evry size & couler of their race the beautiful swan in flocks  were floating upon the Platt which aded beauty to the scenery, we   soon saw a large herd of buffalo about 6 miles from camp & 2 from   the road. we left our horses & stole upon them the best we could  their picket guards were frighted several times we managed to quell their  fears. their is no well disiplined Army of men that are more particular to have  an old experienced guard on a closs look out than a herd of buffalo. by  going under a bank we passed there guards & lay conceled untill we  were surrounded & the main bodies of them were coming onto us with  a heavy filanxs of bulls meeting us in the face with hundreds of cows follow  ing in the rear when they approached within 2 or 3 rods of us we  thought it quite time to be up & doing even for our own safety I had a  single load in my rifle & a brace of Pistols Br Johnson had a slide  of 6 loads in his rifle we rose, he fired twice, I reserved my fire untill  he had discharged his two balls, the whole body broke & run from us. He had  killed none I fired at a Young cow put a ball through her sholdier  but she hobbled over a ridge Johnson mounted a horse & followed  a little distance after them I walked over the ridge & shot my   wounded Cow through the hart strings & lungs & she droped dead which  was the ownly one we got out of the herd we travled a few mile[s]  further & Br A Lyman killed two more & an antilope all of whi[ch]   was brought into camp & distributed large herds came near our camp  in the evening distance of the day 9 m

They informed us the Mexican war was still continued  & that 500 troops would be stationed near Winter quarters  untill spring they would then go to the Head of Grand Island  & build a fort also one at Laramie, and one on Green River  the pretention for building these forts is said to be for the purpose  of protecting the Oregon Emegrants. We sent letters by Capt Walker  to the valley via fort Bridger. He informed us that 100 miles south  of the Utah lake was an excellent country for farming purposes we  continued our journey & camped near a creek on the Platt &   obtained a letter from Wm Clayton one week ahead of us &  still going ahead 13      October 8, 1847 ~ Friday      8th We travled 8 miles & nooned soon after we stoped a large body  of animals appered in sight over the Bluff we at first thought it was  a band of mounted warriors but by the aid of our glasses we found  them to be a band of one hundred or more Elk they made a splended appe-  arance they were about one mile from Camp several of us took our guns &  went after them they were as large as good sized mules I went up a  swail of tall grass the band came within 10 rods of me their horns  waveing in the wee air upbove the weeds like Rocking chairs. The Bucks  were in advanc as the does were the best this season of the year I drew  my gun to my face & waited for one to come in sight. At this instant  another man came up behind me & they saw him & broke & run he   shot at them as they run but did no good they ran near a   Frenchman who shot a doe through the neck & he fell dead the  ownly one killed out of the band though several shots were made  I got a piece of it for my supper the first Elk meat I ever ate  we travled 7 miles & camped on the Bank of the Platt we crossed  many pure streams of water to day distance 15 m      October 9, 1847 ~ Saturday      9th We travled 15 miles & camped on Junktion Bluff fork we   had 2 sandy bluffs to cross to day our horses are still failing  more & more 15 m     
 October 10, 1847 ~ Sunday      10th Sunday The quorum of the Twelve met together & had   a prayer meeting. the camp moved 3 miles in the evening to   better feed. 3 m      October 11, 1847 ~ Monday      11th we travled 10 miles & camped on the Platt above the  Junktion at 3 oclok I went to the Bluff after some Buffalo I got  into a large herd & shot a cow but did not fall but went off  with the herd. In returning to camp darkness over took me I  could not see the camp so I made for the river I had to waid   through swails for 20 rods nearly to my hips in mud & water  I passed through the midst of plenty of ducks gees swan &  wolves I saw one animal of the cat kind which I took to be  a links I struck the platt 4 miles below camp & got in weary  hungry & weary & learned that Br Egbert had killed a cow  & calf at the Bluffs & a company had gone after them &   could not find the camp had like myself to wallow through  the swails we had to raise lights on poles to light them in, one  got lost & did not get in untill 10 oclok 10 m      October 12, 1847 ~ Tuesday      12th I had a question put to me by President Young what my  opinion was concerning one of the Twelve Apostles being appointed  as the President of the church with his two councellors. I  answered that a quorum like the Twelve who had been appointed  by revelation & confirmed by revelation from time to time  I thought it would require a revelation to change the order  of that quorum.* we travled 8 miles & nooned. Br Stillman   shot a buffalo cow I went with my carriage into the Bluffs  about 2 miles & we dressed it which took untill near night I shot  at 2 calves & got neither of them, we did not get into camp   untill 9 oclok at night & Br Stillman & myself worked untill   1 oclok cutting & salting up meat I got but little sleep 16 m   * Whatever the Lord inspires you to do in this matter I am with you      October 13, 1847 ~ Wednesday      13th Our horses are failing more & more daily several gave out today  we travled 14 miles & camped on the north fork of the Platt we  begin to come again to some timber, some buffalo were killed  to day & large herds near us 14 m      October 14, 1847 ~ Thursday      14th We travled 15 miles & camped on the Platt or rather a slew   runing into it, it was cool & windy 15      October 15, 1847 ~ Friday      15th We travled 14 miles to day & camped on the Platt 14 m  nothing of particular interest occured during the day      October 16, 1847 ~ Saturday      16th we travled to day out of the buffalo range & camped on the  Platt. Just before camping our Brethren who had been sent on  to over take the ox teams came to us except two continued on  they could not gain upon the teams & gave it up. Br Luke  Johnson came near being killed by a herd of buffalo travelling  in the night. A large herd came upon him suddenly & he was   caught in the midst of thems & could not get out & the herd  was some 15 minutes passing him & the ownly way he kept them  from treading on him was by hollowing & striking & punching  them with his cane on each side of him as they came along  & they would open just wide enough for him to stand as they   passed along 15     
 October 17, 1847 ~ Sunday      17th Sunday as we had not meat enough to carry our Camp   to winter Quarters it was thought wisdom for a company   of hunters to return back a few miles with some waggons to   the buffalo herds & procure some more meat. Twelve of us   returned back 10 miles with three waggons A Lyman &   myself was among the number, we pitched our camp in   a little timber on a slew of water & we killed two buffalo   during the evening & brought in including buctchers   & teamsters there was about 20 of us & we were all hungry   & after cleaving the body of the meat from the   bones our company roasted the bones, & for our supper   & breakfast we used up the bones of both buffaloes it   is almost incredible what amount of roasted buffalo   meat a hungry man will eat without salt or bread &   not make him sick. there is no other meat known that   a man can eat as much of. The hump bones of a fat   buffalo roasted is the most choice eating of any meat kind   the leg bones are also filled with marrow more choice than   butter & yield a great quantity which we roasted & drank   the melted marrow without bread. We should have made   a delightful picture for an artist to have drawn the scenery   around our fireside. After all had eaten to our full satisfaction   we prepared to make our beds for the night, it was cold & blew   a perfect gale. we made choice of a thicket of willows under a bank   for our lodging place for the night we lay down on the ground & covered   ourselves over with our blankets & robes & had a good nights rest 12.      October 18, 1847 ~ Saturday      18th At daylight 4 of us went to the Bluffs to exahamine the posit-  ion of the herds of buffalo, we saw many both on the Hills & flats   we returned to Camp took our breakfast of roast meat then divi-  ded & went out two by two, Luke Johnson went with me about 3   miles from Camp, we came upon 3 wild horses upon the side of the   bluff, they were splendid looking animals but the most wild   of any animals I ever saw. After returning to the Bluffs we found   that the herds on the upland were travling to the N. & N.E & the ownly   way to obtain meat was for the hunters to confine themselves to the  herds on the flat they did so & killed nine buffalo but seven of them   was dressed & brought in & wolves feasted on the other two. we got   council from Camp for us to return early in the morning & not   tary any longer, we travled in our hunt during the day 16 m      October 19, 1847 ~ Tuesday      [FIGURE]  19th Early this morning we prepared ourselves to return to camp. the   company of hunters started a little before the waggons, we had got   about a mile on the way when we discoverd 7 men about 2   miles from us coming from some scattering timber we at first   took them to be Indians on foot we saw they were approach-  ing us we soon found however they were mounted white men   we then thought they were troops. they soon charged upon   us with all speed, we stood ready with our arms in hand   to meet them, but when they came up to our great surprise   & joy we found them to be the Policce of Winter Quarters led   by Brother Hosea Stout. they informed us that 16 of them had   come from Winter Quarters to meet our camp thinking we  might need some help the remainder of the party stoped at our   main camp, we stoped our teams & returned with then to   our camp ground & got the Brethren some breakfast out of the fat     
 Buffalo. & while this was going on we were busy in asking many questio[ns]   about our wives & children & friends & affairs at Winter Quarters & they   were truly welcome messengers & like Angels unto us.

W. Phelps was cut off from the Church for breaking the  laws of God.      It was decided in Council that if a man lost   his wife he was at liberty to marry again whare he pleased and  was justifyed.      Father John Smith was appointed by the   quorum of the Twelve As the first patriarch over the whole Church  President Young said the Twelve were at liberty to publish papers  in any part of the world whare they should be or take the   best course to spread the work, the twelve should superintend  the printing whareveer they were. And If the Twelve were going  abroad it would be well to ordain Elders out of new members   that were baptized & take with them to preach & there should  ownly one of the Twelve go to one place & call seventies to  their assistance. Our counsel adjourned. E T Benson &   myself rode to Elder Greens branch & attended meeting B Clapp  & Joseph Young preached W.

C. Kimball addressed the Council & said that he had been to  the mountains & got an endowment & felt it in his bones & w[ant]-  ed to talk a little, he said the day had come when iniquity could   not be harboured in the Church, and men because they belong to my fa[mily]  or Br Brigham Youngs family will not be screened in wickedness I w[o]-  uld even turn over to the law of God sons out of my own loins if they  done wrong, will I suffer iniquity to go unpunished in others more th[an]  in my own sons? I tell you nay. Br Andrews has been adopted into  family but let the law of God have its demand upon him if it takes hi[s]  head off for a man had better ienter into life maimed than into  Hell with all his members. The accusations against Br Andrews  were then read some he acknowledged to & some were proven  against him after which President Young addressed the     
 meeting in an interesting manner & gave good teaching. He said a  man by seeking that which did not belong to him would loose  that which he seemeth to have as in this case Br Andrews by   unlawfully marrying this woman is now left without any wife  there is no Elder in this church [who has] any right to marry a woman to  a man who has a living wife, many men act like fools as soon as  they get an idea that women should obey their husbands & be passive in  their hands they will go to the woods & get a bundle of sticks & com-  mence whiping their wives to make them obey them in the first  place a husband should be a righteous man a man of God & rule his   houshold in righteousness & govern his wife with kindness & love & not  with a rod, club, or his fist, his conduct to his wife should be such  that she will love him with all of her heart and he should pray to  God that his wife & children which are jewels given him might be  saved & not taken from him that not any thing need be lost which  the father hath given him. He said that many men through their con-  duct would have taken from them that which they had & given to another.  He said that when a man had a jewel given to him he ought to prize it &  treasure it up & take good care of it & in process of time other jewels  might be given him of the Lord, but he should not undertake to   steal them for he could not keep them, and a man should not  be in a hurry to obtain any blessing or exhaltation that is not for  him & when he has proved himself faithful in all things before  God there is no good thing that will be withheld from him in   time or Eternity & many other good instructions were given      President Joseph Young followed with interesting remarks  & gave it as his opinion that Br Andrews ought to be cut off from  the Church for adultery, most of the quorum of the Twelve   spoke upon the subject also the presidents of the Seventies after  which it was moved & carried that Milo Andrews be cut off  from the church for adultery. it was also moved and carried   that the woman be cut off from the Church fromor adultery. It  was moved & carried that they both be left in the hands of the  Presidents of the Seventies meeting then adjurned and the  Twelve went into the recorders office & met in council      December 22, 1847 ~ Wednesday      22nd I met in council with the Twelve, the Epistle was read  prepared for the Press some other letters read      December 23, 1847 ~ Thursday      23rd I went over the river with the quorum of the Twelve and spent   the night at Council Point we had a meeting I addressed the meeting  and was followed by Brother Joseph Young we had a good meeting 10 m      December 24, 1847 ~ Friday      LOG TABERNACLE CONFERENCE      24th This conference was opened at 10 oclok according to appointment, prayer   by O. Pratt W Woodruff addressed the meeting upon the object of calling  the conference & was followed by O Pratt upon the same subject, much   interesting teaching & instruction was given through the day by a number  who addressed the meeting. The Brethren on that side of the river during   the last three weeks had built a Log Tabernacle for this & other conferences   65 feet by 40 we felt that they had done a great work in so short a time.  After doing the business of the day the quorum of the Twelve spent the  evening in council at Br Richards I spent the night at Br Guymans  The conference was addressed to day by Presidents  Young &  others of the Twelve upon a variety of subjects such as emegrating  to the west, the Brethren on the east side of the river, to assist President  Young & others on the west side with teams & waggons, much interesting     
 teaching & council was given through the day, and their was also   preaching in the evening. The Twelve met in council in the eveni[ng]   & spoke of appointing the first Presidency during the conference and   also named several men to fill up the quorum of the Twelve but it was   not decided who should be the men to fill up that quorum      December 26, 1847 ~ Sunday      26th Sunday the Conference assembled at 10 oclok and was addressed by   Elder Apbleby in an interesting manner upon the political state of   the world the gathering of the Jews at Jerrusalem & many other  interesting things. He was followed by Br Kimball Lyman Benson &   others who spoke in the power of God, during the evening the meeting   was adressed by Professor Pratt & W. Woodruff both had the  spirit of speaking we numbered the people & they were found to   be about 800 in the House. I spent the night as usual with Br Richards      December 27, 1847 ~ Monday      27th A larger number than ever assembled this morning. About 1000   souls got into the House Elder Kimball addressed the meeting this   morning in the Power of God rebuked wickedness and sin & warned   all to repent of their transgressions. The names of the seventies was   then called over and President Young remarked that it would not   be necessary to put them or be organized into quorums while here but   remain in a body under their presidents untill they arived at the  valley, that while any quorum of the seventies of twelve were full   though they might be scattered to the fore corners of the earth   would not be filled up in Zion or any place but when there was  a vacancy by death or aposticy then the vacancy might be filled  we learned from Presidents Youngs teaching that it was necess[ary]  to keep up a full organization of the Church through all time   as far as could be at least the three first Presidency quorum  of the Twelve Seventies, and Patriarch over the whole Churc[h]  &c so that the devil could take no advantage of us.      The subject was discused or spoke upon by O. Pratt concerning  the appointing of the first Presidency and Patriarch over   the whole Church others spoke upon the subject. It was then   moved secon[d]ed and carried universally that Brigham Young be the   President over the whole Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints  President Young then nominated Heber C. Kimball to be his first   Councellor which was seconded and carried unanimously  President Young then nominated Wilard Richards as his second   councellor which was seconded and carried universally  It was then moved seconded and carried universally that   President John Smith be the Patriarch over the whole Church  Much important and interesting instruction was given upon   these and other subjects after which among which was the  subject of the resurrection spoken upon by President Young  He said there was nothing more to be learned by the people upon  the subject than what was written the subject was made  plain in the Bible and other revelations & it was not a subject   that we wanted to use & at the present time as we had not come to  the resurrection But there ^was^ no person except a resurrected body   who held the Keys of the resurrection. Michael the Ark Angel   or Ancient of Days who was Father Adam held the Keys of the  resurrection.      The Conference adjourned untill 10 oclock  on the 6th day of next April.      during the evening the people met with the band of music  at the tabernacle & spent the evening in music, singing &   dancing     
 December 28, 1847 ~ Tuesday      [2]8th In company with the Twelve I crossed the river on the   ice & returned to winter quarters I was nearly sick, when I   reached home & had been was nearly all the when time at confer  ence 12 m      December 29, 1847 ~ Wednesday      29th I attended a council with the Presidency & High cou  ncil and herd the report of Br Cutler who had been on a mis  [s]ion to the South his report was interesting it showed the Lord   was opening doors for the further progress of the work in the   earth esspecially among the Lamanites. may the Lord hasten   the work.      The Brethren put up my chimney to day which   had follen down      December 30, 1847 ~ Thursday      30th I spent the day at home choreing Br Alger brought me a   load of corn to day, it was a damp wet day Br Wild spent   the evening with me      December 31, 1847 ~ Friday      31st [FIGURE] This is the last day of 1847 I went to the mill and got   8 bushels of wheat ground I had an interview with President   Young in the morning upon a variety of subjects among which was the   object of going east on a mission. we were introduced to Mr Mulho-  land from Nauvoo and herd letters read from there Help me keep thy commandments O Lord        Thus ends annother Year which has been interesting and importa  nt year to the Saints. The Twelve Apostles with their brethren, one   hundred and fourty three souls as pioneers have made a journey more   than one thousands miles to the Rocky mountains and sought out a   place for a city, a stake of Zion, and a Temple of the Lord that the saints   may have a place to flee to while the indignation of the Lord passeth   over the nation that hath driven them out. Our Journey to the mountains   & back again to Winters Quarters with horse, mule, and ox teams has been over   2000 miles more than half of the journey we have had to make new roads   & with all of our exposures, sickness, & dangers not a human life has been lost   but all returned in safety and what is more singular still, not a horse mule   ox, cow, or calf was lost either going or returning except 2 horses shot by disobeying   council. The blessing of the Lord has been great upon us as a people during   the past year in all the various portions of the Camp of Israel. we have   now found a place to build a Stake of Zion whare the people can gather   together & build up Zion. The past year has shown forth the fulfi-  llment of Prophecy in the wars, rumours of wars, famins, pestilence,   distress of nations with perplexity and in many of the signs of the   times. The United States in their wars with the feble Nation of   Mexico have involved themselve in a debt of one hundred and fifty   millions of dollars besides the loss of twenty five thousand men   & twice that number to Mexico and their own expenses in the war, the   famine has raged in Irleland, the cholera through Europe, the breaking   of banks & merchants has distressed the people in England. The Baron   Rothchilds the rich Jew has become a member in the British Parliament   which is a new eary in the History of the Jews, & they the Jews are   gathering home to Jerrusalem by thousands what 1848 will bring to   pass in the History of the Church and Kingdom of God time must   determin and also in the History of the Nations of the Earth. May   the LORD hasten the gathering of Israel & the building up of Zion for   Jesus Christ Sake Amen  The following page contains a synopsis of my travels during the year of 1847

In the evening I went to the   council House with Brs Kington & Benbow & the Twelve   & herd the Presidents message of the U.S. read which   took two hours & a half to read      January 9, 1848 ~ Sunday      9th Sunday In company with Br Kington I went to Br   Phineas Richards & preached to the people I spent the evening at home      January 10, 1848 ~ Monday      10th I spent the day at home. The following is the address   of Br W. J. Appleby Recklesstown ^P.O^ Binlington Co N.J.      January 11, 1848 ~ Tuesday      11th I spent the day drawing wood and in the evening attended   the ward meeting     
 January 12, 1848 ~ Wednesday      12th I took my family out to a ride in the carriage I rode through  through the great corn field 2 1/2 miles through it saw large flocks  of prairie chickens I shot one and brought it home 10 th      January 13, 1848 ~ Thursday      13th Luther Scammans address is Lamoille, Bagurau ^Bureau^ Co Ill  He is situated 14 miles from Peru the termination of the canal  100 from Chicago 150 from Nauvoo,  [FIGURE] I wrote him a letter to day informing him that  we should probably visit him in the spring on our  way east. I also wrote a letter to Br Apbleby      January 14, 1848 ~ Friday to January 15, 1848 ~ Saturday      14th & 15 th I spent the time at home choreing      January 16, 1848 ~ Sunday      16th Sunday I took my wife & children into my carriage  & crossed the river on the ice and rode to the Log tabernacle  to attend the meeting, which opened at 11 oclock there being present  B. Young G. A. Smith & W Woodruff of the Twelve. G A Smith  opened the meeting by prayer and W Woodruff addressed  the assembly upon the subject of their being one in all things  & the gathering of Israel, building up of Zion, &c. And was  followed by President Young who made many good rema  rks [FIGURE] He said the Lord would give his spirit to teach and instruct   from the private member to the President of the church, but  he will never give any man or woman his spirit to dictate   & direct his file leader, he related an anacdote of a female   runing a race upon a great wager lost it by stoping on the way   to pick up a Jewel.       He said truly that if we were not one we  were not the Lords.      In speaking of the duties of the Priesthood   he said if this people holding the Priesthood should settle down  & go to cultivating the earth & entirely neglect the preaching  of the gospel the earth would open & swallow them up &  hide them from his sight.      The whole day & evening  was taken up in teaching & council      January 17, 1848 ~ Monday      17th The fore part of the day was taken up in business & teach  ing & council the spirit of the Lord was with the people  Among other subjects President Young s[p]oke upon the subject  of danceing & said that danceing was not an ordinance of the  gospel or of the House of the Lord. But the organization of man  is such that it requires a variety, singing stimulates the whole  system & the mental mind to such a degree that they want to  dance, this is well enough in its place, every thing that is calcula  ted to fill the soul with Joy is ordained of God & is prpoper for  the Saints if they acknowledge God in all things & do not sin  but dont mingle with the wicked world & sin but serve the  Lord with it. And the ownly lawful place to dance is in a tem-  ple or a place of endowments, you will never see any music  or danceing in Hell neither Joy or gladness will be there but  these things will be in Heaven many other interesting rema-  rks were made.      The afternoon & evening was spent in music and danceing  the old grey headed man, with the young man, maiden and  children went forth in the dance together & praised the Lord  in the dance and all was peace and harmony     
 January 18, 1848 ~ Tuesday      18th The fore part of this day was also spent in teaching  & giving council, the Twelve occupied most of the time  Two petitions were presented to the meetings for signitures  one for a county in the Potawattame tract of land in Iowa  and the other for a Post Office and the People were signing  them daily Br Henry Miller and others were appointed to go to  the Legislature of the State of Iowa to petition for the county &  $30 were raised by the people ^to^ bear their expenses many interesting  speaches were made by the people      The afternoon & evening of this day was also spent in singing  music & danceing, and at the close of the evening this   congregation were dismissed & other branches of the church  were to take it tomorrow as all could not get into the House  at the same time      January 19, 1848 ~ Wednesday      19th We had a new & full congregation to day, the fore  part of the day was taken up as usual with teaching, instruction  & council & the spirit of the Lord was with us. the after noon  & evening was as usual spent in singing, music, & dancing, square  Merit, the Soux Indian agent, A Major, capt & Lieut. from Fort Carney  were present and seemed to be pleased with the appearance of  things      January 20, 1848 ~ Thursday      20th This is the last day of our meeting with the Saints  at the Log tabernacle, the congregation was addressed at some  length by Br G A. Smith upon a variety of subjects giving advise  to the saints not to locate on the river bottom but go to the bluffs  & north whare there is a plenty of timber & open farms whare  there is plenty of room also advised them to pay their tithing  & not admit of making use of ardent spirits, & spoke upon   other subjects & was followed by W. Woodruff who backed up  the testimony of Br Smith after which several business matters  were taken up.      The afternoon & evening as usual was spent in singing, music,  & dancing at the close, President Young addressed the meeting  in an interesting manner, and said he wished the Saints to  get so quick in their understandings that when they herd his  tex that they might know his whole sermon without his preaching  it or stoping to explain evry item. And his text was now let   the Saints stop dancing for if you get up parties all over the  country here and go to danceing sin and iniquity will grow out   of it but all has been right here thus far I have watched you  & all has been in quiete & peacable & good order & the spirit of the  Lord has been here. And the President dissmissed the people  pronounceing the blessings of God upon the people. I with several  other of the brethren spent my time with Br Richards who  was vary kind in entertaining the Saints      January 21, 1848 ~ Friday      21st We all returned home to our dwellings in Winter Quarters  it had been exeeding warm & plesant during our whole visit  at the Log tabernacle meeting & we found all well on our return  home. Br's Babitt, H. Kimball & Snider arived from Nauvoo  & returned to Winter Quarters with us & brought some papers  giving an account of the wars & distress of nations with famine  Pestilence & Judgment     
 January 22, 1848 ~ Saturday      22nd I spent the day at home choreing      January 23, 1848 ~ Sunday      23rd Sunday I preached to the saints in my ward was followed  by Brs Pulsipher & Porter & we had a good time and in the eve  ning I went to the Council House and met with a large assembly  Professor Pratt addressed them quite lengthy upon asstronomy  philosophy, and various principles which he had studied much upon  and also read a lengthy document which he had written which  was highly interesting to us. He advised the seventies to devote all  of their leasure moments to reading & study & fulfill the commandments  which says we should treasure up wisdom & knowledge by faith & by  study out of the best books that we may have a knowledge of things  in heaven & on earth of kingdoms & countries things which are at home  & abroad, the wars perplexities of nations &c In the lecture given by   Professor Pratt he intirely overthrows many of the systems of modern  phylosiphers & asstronomiers & modern reasoning in many respects, to  overthrow the gentile Christian Argument, "that God made the Heavens  Sun, moon, & stars and the earth & all that in them are out of nothing  in six days He said that it was admitted by modern phylosophers that  stars had been discoverd through telescopes so remote from the earth  that it would take thirty thousand years for the light of it to reach  this earth though it should travel at the rate of two hundred thousand   miles per second, so it must have been in exhistance 24000 years  before this earth was formed. He overthrows the principle of Immate-  riality & clearly shows that God, Angels, spirits, are material as well as  men, beasts, vegitables minerals, &c that matter is eternal & infinite  without end or bounds & that space is infinite & without bounds or end  that matter, the elements, intelligence were not created neither   indeed can be, & were from all eternity & that God formed the  Heavens & earth out of unorganized materials or matters which  did exhist in some form & were not made out of nothing. In  speaking of the spirit of God he remarked to me that the Holy  Spirit that was through all things, and round about all things, & that  governed & controlled all things are intelligent atoms the same as God is  composed of hence it is called the spirit of God, & he had no dobt  but that there were some of these atoms combined in all the miner-  al, vegitable, & animal Kingdoms & by the aid of those intelligent  atoms were enabled to abide the law by which they were governed  many other interesting principles were presented by Professor Pratt  when he closed I followed him and exhorted the people to listen   to his council & improved their time I also advised the Camp   to hold meetings in each ward on Sunday & prayer meetings at   least one evenings in each week that if they would pray more  they would have much less spirit of complaining among them I  remarked that the spirit of the Lord & the spirit of the  devil would not dwell together but a short time in the same   person or tabernacle but one would govern & the other leave  I also warned the people against judging any matter whatever  untill they herd both sides of the question for in most all   cases any person would be apt to give a wrong judgment by merely  hearing one side of the question. And that the Elders could  not be in possession of any to much truth upon any subject  whatever in order to magnify there callings among the nations  of the earth for if they should be called to stand before Kings  Princes, Asstronomiers Phylosophiers & the learned of the earth  they would find use for all there knowledge     
 January 24, 1848 ~ Monday      24th I met in council withe the Twelve & High Council & herd  a charge prefered by the Policee against E. D Wolley for making  use of sedicious language against the Authorities of the Church  the letter of the accusation was sustained against Br Wolley  but it was not supposed by any that the spirit of sedition  was in his heart. It proved to be an interesting meeting as muc[h]  teaching & instruction was drawn out of the Presidency High  Council, Twelve &c. Br Wooley in his plea expressed his   feelings that the Hickery Clubs carried by the policee, & the council  for Bishops to preside over any parties in the place to keep order,  and that the Policee would not suffer a man to let his own cattle  get into his own crops to destroy them were oppressive to his  feelings. President Young said he wanted to speak upon the   spirit of the thing with Br Wolleys, that the things that oppress  Br Wolleys feelings would have no effect upon him if all had  been right with him but he had got the spirit of the world & did  not feel right. Said that the law was for the unruly & that   it must rest upon good men in order to reach the unruly &  transgresser. many gave their opinion upon the subject  Br Wooley made his confession that he had spoken in an im-  proper manner in a moment of passion he was forgiven by the  council & all was settled. W. Woodruff in his remarks said   he would advise evry individual not to make any decision or give  any judgment or opinion upon any subject whatever untill  they herd both sides of the question, Council was dismissed   & we returned home. Brs Pratt & Levi Richards & myself  visited Br Henman's family to administer to them for the whole  family was sick & had been troubled with evil spirits we   prayed with this family & laid hands upon 7 that were  sick of the household the spirit of the Lord was with us  & we rebuked the sickness & commanded the evil spirits   to depart & they recieved a blessing upon the family. Br's  Pratt & Richards returned to my house & spent several   hours in conversing about science, Phylosophy, Astronomy,  and a variety of things of interest      January 25, 1848 ~ Tuesday      25th We met in Council with the Twelve & High Council   A. Babit, H. Kimball, & John Snider they made a report of   affairs at Nauvoo & recieved some council President Young  did not wish the temple to be sold and a number of other  things were spoken of some little difference of feelings settelled  during the evening I attended meeting in our ward      January 26, 1848 ~ Wednesday      26th I spent the day at home reading, writing, choreings &c I spent  the evening at Br Neff.      January 27, 1848 ~ Thursday to January 28, 1848 ~ Friday      27th 28th I spent the days at home choping wood      January 29, 1848 ~ Saturday      29th Presidents Young & Kimball called upon me at my house  a little while this morning the first time that Br Young has  been into my house since we returned from the mountains  we conversed together a short time we then all went to  council together with the High Council & spent several hours   & then dispersed     
 January 30, 1848 ~ Sunday      30th Sunday we had one of the most terrible storms we have   had for several Years it has been exeeding worm for many days   the wind blew hard from the North commenced raining & freezing   then snowing & exeeding cold & the storm lasted through the   day and night which blew snow into many houses it was also   tedious upon cattle. Mrs Woodruff was quite sick through the night   & kept her bead through the day      January 31, 1848 ~ Monday      31st The storm abated in the latter part of the night & the   sun arose plesant this morning I spent the day at home      February 1, 1848 ~ Tuesday      Feb 1st I spent the day at home choreing      February 2, 1848 ~ Wednesday      2nd I spent the day reading & writing      February 3, 1848 ~ Thursday      3rd I attended a feast prepared by the defenders of Nauvoo or those   who were in the Battle of Nauvoo most of those who composed   the assembly were individuals who were in that memoriable   action it was ascerted that there was not more than 100 saints   at any one time in the fight while the mob that was fighting   agaist the Saints numbered from 800 to 1000 and their was   but three of the Saints killed and one or two slightly wounded   while there was several waggon loads of the mob killed & many   wounded & the enemy driven from the field, but the Lord   was with the Saints & saved their lives. The Saints wore a   read badge on the left arm to distinguish them from their   enemies in the battle, they wore the same to day at the feast at   the opening of the performences President Kimball deliverd an  address upon the subject of the Battle of Nauvoo & was followed  by Col Johnson, after which their was feasting singing music &   some dancing. A figure was got up called the Battle of Nauvoo   whiched was danced & the Saints felt to praise the Lord for   their deliverance      February 4, 1848 ~ Friday      4th I spent the day at home reading the Book of Enoch      February 5, 1848 ~ Saturday      5th I went into the woods with several of the Brethren & choped   loaded & brought home five loads of wood      February 6, 1848 ~ Sunday      6th Sunday I preached to a congregation of Saints in Br Phineas   Richards ward & had a good time      February 7, 1848 ~ Monday      7th I spent most of the day reading I read a pamphlet called   the voice of truth, containing the Prophet Joseph Smith   views of the powers & policy of the government of the United   States, and corressppondence with Gen James Arlington Bennett,  appeal to the green mountain Boys, correspondence with, John   C. Calhoon, and Henry Clay, a friendly hint to Missouri, and an   interesting sermon from President Smith. These letters &   writings are of much interest & show the spirit of the tim-  es & the mighty rebuke of wicked men by that great, good,   & wise Prophet Joseph I was much edifyed in reading it   I spent the evening in reading the book of Jasher & was   edifyed with that Br Benbow & myself laid hands upon a   sick youth      February 8, 1848 ~ Tuesday      8th I spent the day at home during the meeting at our school   house in the evening I gave a synopsis of my meditations   concerning our duties as a people     
 February 9, 1848 ~ Wednesday      9th I have been troubled for several days with a head ake   I finished reading the Book of Jasher & found it to be   an interesting work. It speaks of the great victories   the Twelve Patriarchs the sons of Jacob accomplished in   their Battles with their enemies in consequence of their great   faith in God and of Joseph career in Egypt & many other   interesting things      February 10, 1848 ~ Thursday      10th [FIGURE] I made President B Young a present of fine   blue broad cloth which I got in England I spent a part   of the day with Br Young I walked with him from the   office to Br Warner Porters whare President Young administ[ered]   in the ordances of the house of the Lord. I read several papers  from the eastern states which gives an account of the dredful   famine in Ireland more than 130,000 persons have died in the   famine and apparently the destress has but just began, also the   the breaking of the banks and large firms throughout England   which has caused a great panic & much perplexity throughout   those nations the United States are still at war with Texas   & much division in the government concerning the war      February 11, 1848 ~ Friday to February 12, 1848 ~ Saturday      11th & 12th I still suffer with pain in the head I spent these   days at home reading writing & choreing      February 13, 1848 ~ Sunday      13th Sunday It is the most beautiful & warm weather that   [FIGURE] I ever saw in the winter time. The Camp of of the   Saints met at the stand for a meeting to day meeting opened   by singing, & prayer by W. Woodruff, the meeting was then  addressed by President Kimball then addressed the meeting   and said that he wanted to give an exhertation and a word of   caution and after reproving the saints said many flattered   themselves that they were going to lean upon others to save   them without doing any thing themselves but they will   get disappointed, for to bring up a figure he said you migh[t]  graft ever so many sproughts into a tree if they did not adhear   to the tree they would remain there dead sticks stick-  ing out of the tree they would be dead themselves, not   bring forth fruit, & do the tree no good but ownly scar   it up, & those scars would remain untill the dead sticks   were broakke off & the skcar healed over or other grafts   put in that would bring forth fruit. So it was with all   who leaned upon others to save them & would not   harken to their council & take their advice & no man   can save them if do not save themselves and many   other remarks of Interest he made.      W. W. Phelps then read the V chapter of Math as he   had translated it from the greek      W Woodruff advised the people who were going to   settle on the east side of the river not to settle on the   bank or in the bottoms so that the first flood need   not wash them into the Mo river.      Meeting was dismissed   after which in company with Mrs Woodruff I went to   Br Pulsiphers and soon Presidents Young & Kimball came   & attended to sealing four couple in matrimony, we had   a feast of spruice beer & cakes on the occasion     
 during the evening I attended the meeting of the Seventies   being 3 of their presidents present, Joseph Young Z. Pulsipher   A. P. Rockwood the House was crouded to excess the meeting  was opened by singing & prayer. And was then addressed   by A P Rockwood who spoke upon the government of   children that Parents ought to set a good exhample before   their children & not nickname them but call them by   their proper name for the way that Parents set their   children going in life they are apt to go through & if they   start with Jim, Jo, & Pall, they are apt to go through   life so,.      Br Pulsipher followed & made many   interesting remarks. And he was followed by President   Joseph Young who reproved them in the spirit of the Lord   against the spirit of dancing & warned them to forsake all   sin & be faithful in all things He spoke in the spirit and power   of God feeling the responsibility he was under when he closed   his remarks W. Woodruff arose and said that should   I say that I did not desire to address the Seventies I should do   dishonor to my own feelings for I do desire it at this time.   All who know my course when I have been at head quarters with   the Presidency either with Joseph, Brigham, or others of the twelve   know that I have never put myself forward to preach or teach   the people, why hath it been so, because I have had file leaders   between me and God whose business it is to lead teach & instruct   the inhabitants of Zion and I have felt it more my duty to sit   & hear while with them at head quarters than to put myself   forward to teach yet when I have been called upon to speak   I have endeavoured to do the best I could, but when I have   been abroad in the vineyard I have had the spirit of my   mission & been much blessed in bringing souls into the   kingdom of God. And I do feel it a privilege to address   the Seventies at this time, Br Young asked me to speak in   the fore part of the evening but I desired to wait untill the   Presidency of Seventies had address them and I can now see   that it was wisdom for I should not have had the same   matter before me that I now have, I have a number of things   resting upon my mind which I wish to lay before you. Your   President Joseph Young has spoken to you in the spirit & power   of God to night has warned & exhorted you not to defile  your Priesthood & calling & not to have your minds all taken   up with fiddleing & dancing. I have taken up more real injoy-  ment this evening in hearing the teaching giving by your   Presidency than I would in hearing a million of dollars worth   of fiddle strings worn out, you must not think hard of   Br Joseph Young because he reproves, rebukes, & ehxhorts you   with all long sufferings & doctrin, for their is an almighty   responsibility resting upon his shoulders as the seenier President   of this August body of Sevenenties ordained unto the Apostle-  ship and the Lord will hold him responsible for the manner   that he watches over the Seventies and he is stired up from time   to time by the spirit of the God of Israel to reprove you and   the rebukes of a friend are far better than the kisses of an   enemy and you must not think hard of Br Young if he   does reprove you for he does it for your good. It is for better for   you to spend your time getting instruction & council than in   fiddleing & dancing for while the latter is of no profit to you the   former you will need when you are seperated far from your Brethren     
 and abroad among the nations of the earth amid the   Judgments of God which are laying waste the people & while   you have to dodge between wind & water to save your head  in the midst of persecution a[f]ter persecution & mobs while   you are offering salvation to the people. I have meditated   much of late concerning the responsibility we are to God  under to God inasmuch as we bear the priesthood & are   numbered among the Lords Anointed as Angels are  watching us & bearing a report of us daily to God should   the Lord come down to see us to see for himself if the   reports of [us] was correct, what would the Lord think of   us & how would we like to hear the record read in the morning   of the resurrection containing an account of an assembly   of the Lords Anointed at Winter Quarters, upon whom   all heaven leaned & depended upon in carrying out the   purposes of the Lord in the Lord last dispensation & fulness   of times and fulfilling the expectations of Abraham, Isaac   & Jacob & all the Holy Prophets & Apostles since the world   began in gathering the Jews & rebuilding Jerrusalem gathering   the saints & rebuilding up Zion preparing the way for the   endowment of the ten tribes of Israel in the north country   & the covertion of the Lamanites in the west, & the   warning of all the gentile world that they may be left   without excuse when the Judgments of God cleanse the earth   from sin, wickedness, & pollution, and that our prayers  should ascend into the heavens for the Lord to avenge the   Blood of the Prophet Joseph & other saints who have been   martered & slain by gentile mobs in the last days, while   there is so much depending upon us & our prayers should   we be satisfyed with the record of this city of the Saints in the   eternal world kept by the Angels of Heaven If we should   hear read before an assembled world that the inhabitants   of Winter Quarters who were the Lords Anointed during   the winter of 1847 & 8 spent nine days of their time   in fiddleing & dancing whare they did one in prayer &   praise to almighty God, I say would we be satisfyed   with such record? No we would not, then let us turn from   such seenes of folly & spend more time in meetings   for preaching, exhortation, & prayer before the Lord   Br Joseph exhorted the Elders "not to defile their Priesthood."   I will here say If any man wants to feel the pangs of   Hell let him have the Priesthood & let him have  immortal glory, eternal life, Thrones power domin-  ions, exhaltations with all the blessings of Abraham,   Isaac & Jacob in view, then let him break the   law of God & defile his Priesthood and in a moment   he falls from his high esstate and all of his exhalted   hopes vanish in a moment & when his eyes are open   to see things as they are he sinks in darkness & wo  & the vary sight of the blessings which he has lost causes   a hotter Hell through his soul than fire and brimestone   many other remarks were made by the speaker after which   Br Cumings addressed the meetings & spoke of his mission to England   made some vary appropriate remarks after which the meeting closed     
 February 14, 1848 ~ Monday      14th I spent the day at home      February 15, 1848 ~ Tuesday      15th I spent the day at home but had a good meeting at night      February 16, 1848 ~ Wednesday      16th I spent this day at home reading      February 17, 1848 ~ Thursday      17th I carried 9 bushels of wheat & 5 of buckwheat to the  water mill I spent the day untill 12 oclok at night with  Br Davis grinding in the mill Mrs Woodruff spent the  time with Sister Davis & we went home in the night      February 18, 1848 ~ Friday      18th The soldiers have a meeting to day at the Log tabe-  rnacle Br Young, Kimball, & O. Pratt was expected to be   there, O Pratt was there but the others were at Br   Hydes as he had just returned from the east.  we also recieved a large mail to day from various parts  of the earth several stars from Liverpool showing the  rapid progress ot our cause through England Scotland and   Wales and of the hard warfare of our worthy friend   Capt Dan Jones it seems as though nearly all Wales  was against him yet he is baptizing daily as he is travl-  ing through the nation we also got news of the Mexican  War, American Congress, the loss of life on the lakes &  rivers &c      February 19, 1848 ~ Saturday      19th I administered to Br Willard Richards early in the  morning who has been sick near two months I spent most  of the day in reading Br Johnathan containing the life  of Gen Z Taylor History of the Mexican War and plates of  the several Battles in Mexico &c      February 20, 1848 ~ Sunday      20th Sunday I preached to the saints in our ward. In the evening   I went with Mrs Woodruff to Br P. Richards & herd two letters  read from his Sons in England which were interesting, we then  called upon Willard Richards who was sick soon President Young  came in sat a few moments and I went home with him &  spent an hour or two and read some late papers      February 21, 1848 ~ Monday      21st I spent the day at home      February 22, 1848 ~ Tuesday      22nd Br John Grierson came to the city to day the first time he has  been here for one year & a half I look him up & brought him home  with me he attended meeting with me in the evening and   spent the night with me. He took his cloths which Br Smoot left  with us for him      February 23, 1848 ~ Wednesday      23rd [FIGURE] I called upon Br Richards in the morning soon Pres-  ident Young came in we went into the office & attended   to some Business. Br Brown came in & requested one of us  to go & preach the funeral sermon of his daughter who was  dead. Presidents Brigham & Joseph Young & myself went  to his house, we found not ownly his daughter dead   but a number sick in the house. The meeting opened by  singing & prayer by Joseph Young, after which President  B. Young arose addressed the meeting & said that he had a few rem-  arks to make & desired that he might have the Holy spirit while he  spoke. Said it was better to go [to] the House of mourning than to the House   of feasting for that was the end of the living & would force   upon our minds the truth of the desolution which we must all pass through     
 we mourn for the loss of our friends when they die but if  they die in the Lord they are better off than the living for they  have gained one victory which the living have not they are   beyound the reach of pain, sorrow, wicked men, devils, and  devlish spirits which we are not, for we are daily in the  midst of all the suffering that mortal man is heir to &   when will this suffering end, when we die & not before,  unless we should live untill Satan is bound but all must  pass through death. Yet I would be glad to live to assist in  binding Satan as to the Saints we are being worn out  according to the workd of the Lord we have been driven &  persecuted in such a manner that there are but few constit-  utions among us except such as are broaken to peaces &  ready to fall into the grave & we are burying up the Saints  vary fast whareever we go over four hundred are laid   in the grave in this place & many in all places whare we  have stoped, but all of this pain, sorrow, death & affliction  will work to gether for the good of the Saints for these   things must needs be in order to work out the purposes of  the Almighty & give the Saints there exhaltation and Glory in  the Eternal World. the sectarian wourld with the knowledge  they have would if it was in their power sweep the fall   of man, death, pain, sorrow & afflictions with all their  attendant evils into oblivion & caused man to have lived  eternally as he was before the fall that he might never   have seen death, but such a course would in the end have  been the greatest curse that could have been heaped upon man  for by so doing it would entirely have frustrated the design  of the Almighty in the Creation of man & blocked up the way  for his exhaltation glory & greatness & the Lord understood   the subject so well before either the world or man was formed  that a Saviour was provided in the Lamb slain from before the  foundation of the world to redeem man from Eternal dead  so that by man paying the deabt of the fall by passing through  the temporal death, they recieve the power & glory of the  resurrection by Jesus Christ which gives them an Immortal  body which will recieve a far greater glory and power than  the mortal body ever could have obtained unto had it not  have been for the fall. And I suppose If I had power IWith  the limited Knowledge I have I should sweep from the midst  of this people sickness, pain, sorrow, poverty & persecution & mobings  I dont suppose I should ever have suffered this people to have  been driven at all by a mob but as the Lord knows so much   more than we do He has suffered it so to be & it is for a wise  purpose in God, it is for our good & will finally prove for  our exhaltation & glory in the eternal world, & gives us experi  ence in this life which we otherwise should not have had. "Adam   fell that men might be, men are that they may have Joy, but if  they knew no Joy they would have no sorrow, and if they did not  know misery they would not know happiness" for man must   experience one in order to comprehend & know the other Jesus  had to descend below all things in order to ascend above all things,  I am fully convinced that all our sorrows & troubles will work  out for us a far more exeeding & eternal wait of glory, hence we  ought nought to murmer or complain at our fate. It is true  we mourn at the loss of friends but not as those with out hope     
 or blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from hence forth saith  the spirit for they rest from their labours (& if their friends are  faithful) their works will follow them, but what is the time of  our suffering in this life in comparison with Eternity After we have  spent millions of ages in Eternity & we look back upon our time here  & it will ownly look like the twinkling of an eye in comparison  and so it will be in the waiting for the resurrection of our bodies  it will be for a moment as it were before we shall stand in our  immortal bodies but no person can have power to raise the dead  except he holds the Keys of the Resurrection & no man can hold  the Keys of the resurrection or be ordained unto that power  untill he has died & been raised from the dead himself no  more than than a man has power to baptize a man legally  & lay hands upon him for the Holy Ghost & ordain him to the  office of an Elder who has not been baptized or ordained   himself. Michael the Ark Angel (Adam) holds the Keys of the  resurrection and after a man is raised from the dead has   an immortal body & recieves an ordination to hold the Keys of  the resurrection from under the Hands of Michael or those  having authority he then has power to raise the dead & not   before. Jesus was the first fruits of the Resurrection "He had  power to lay down his life & power to take it again," [##John 10:18##] when He   had lain in the grave three days an Angel, some person who   was appointed to this work appeared rolled back the stone & called  Jesus forth. We have power here through the Priesthood to lay  hands upon the sick & they recover, to cast out devils open the eyes  of the blind & unstop the ears of the deef according to the faith of the chil-  dren of men. It is just as easy to raise the dead for one who is ordained  unto this power as it is for us to administer in the ordinances of the  House of the Lord here. Some times we lay hands upon the sick &  they are healed instantly other times with all the faith & medicine they  are a long time getting well, & others die. The spirit of devils who  are deprived of having tabernacles are constantly making war with  men who have tabernacles & they strive to take up their abode in  the tabernacles of men because they have none of their own, & where  they can get a chance they will many of them croud into one man  & try to reign there & some times they will kill the body & then   the spirit of the man & devils all have to leave it some times in   sickness & weakness the spirit of deavels get possession of the  body whare the spirit of man is pure & overcomes it but the  moment the spirit leaves the body it is beyound the power &  reach of the devils, some children are killed in this way for  the devil is making war with every thing that has a tabernacle  esspecially the Saints, & the devil rules a great deal in the hearts  of the children of men, and if he cannot go in any other way   he will go into a barrel of whiskey & run down their throats  and when the saints get into the valley away from the valley  gentiles the deavel will get into the Half mormons Hickery  mormons & will plead with them to get into them but when   we consider how little time we have to spend in this life in  comparison to Eternity we ou[gh]t not to consider it a hard matter  to be faithful to God & keep his commandments for when we  obtain Celestial glory we shall have to exclaim that it is through  the grace of God after all, for the glory far exceeds our sufferings   in this life.      Manny Many other remarks were made by  President Young and meeting was dismissed by W Woodruff

He also spoke of rich men in this church & Kingdom being bro-  ught down poor He said men could ownly rise, assend, & be exhalted  according as they had decended below, been abased made poor &c  many other remarks were made. I spent the evening with  Mrs Woodruff at Sister Pratts whose husband has gone to the  Islands of the sea      March 11, 1848 ~ Saturday      11th I spent the day at home      March 12, 1848 ~ Sunday      12 Sunday I spent most of the day at home      March 13, 1848 ~ Monday      13 Monday I spent the day at home and the evening At Br Blanchards  I went to Br W.

 March 17, 1848 ~ Friday      17th March 1848 I spent the day at home I attended a   Council of much importance in the evening. The Captain of   the Policee with two others who were members of the Seventies   were brought before the Presidency of the Seventies for assault   & batterry & swearing. There was present but three of the   Presidents of the Seventies, but the High Council was present also   President Young & W Woodruff it was agreed by the parties to try  the case before the High Council, which was filled up and the charges   read, the defendants did not exactly plead guilty so the testimony   was heard on both sides & it was proven there was a fight between  them & swearing. The Plaintiff opened the subject called witne-  sses who testifyed. The defendants spoke & bore their testimony the   Plaintiff then made his plea & also his councillor the defendants   then made their plea also their Councellor.      Then President   Young arose and addressed the council in an interesting manner   the following is an extract of the Clerks munites of the President   speech. If all parties are willing I will now make some remarks   there are a good many item pertaining to this case. 1st it was to be  brought before the President of the 70, but they did not pro  fess to have any Jurisdiction in the case ownly in the trial of   their membership but not as a peace officer. But the High   council can sit as a municipal court & try them for Church   fellowship and for a breach of duty as a Policee officer is it supp-  osed that a public officer cannot do worgong wrong I do not   think so & when they do wrong they should be reproved as   well as any other person, I shall speak my mind without   any regard to parties favor or affection this I always calculate   to do whether I gain friends or foes I have plenty of enemies   But I dont ask any favors of them I will not be turned for   a moment out of the course of right & justice if it cuts my  throat. I shall tell the truths some who have pled this cause dar[e]  not tell all the truth, if Mr Hill did tantilize the Policee they had  no business to fall upon him & beat him. I have known Br Hill  for fifteen years He is given to rough uncouth conversation   and tantalizing mens feelings, and he wont apostitize neither   Let me reason the case I am a teacher I often officiat in that   capacity. For instance Hosea Stout says that for 8 years he has   had a catalogue of names in his own mind of those who would   apostitize and as yet he had not been mistakened If a man under-  stands the things of God, he knows well that every Saint of   God ifs followed up through life by the powers of Hell, of the devil   of temptation, & of evry snare that can be invented on the earth   to make him apostitize, loose his glory & crown, this I understand   If I see a man doing wrong or is any way faltering If I take a course   to make him believe that he will fall does not that at once weaken   his faith & disarm him of power to stand? it does, dont I see things   as well as the Policee I do and if I saw a man that I knew   would fall I would not tell him so but would try to save him  as well as I could that when he did go my garments would be   clear before God & he could not rise in Judgment against me  I am here to save both Br Hosea & Hill but not to destroy them   we are here to the Policee as policee and to inquire into their   conduct as Elders. Has not Isaac Hill been afflicted and maimed   who sent Hosea Stout to take Isaac Hill as a Prisioner Nobody     
 was there disorder. I will admit Isaac Hill was out of ordor   to go into a store in the mids of a contention & undertake to tantili-  ze a mans feelings while he was in anger under pretence of reproving   him for swearing A far better way would have been for him to have   waited untill he was calm & composed & took him one side & in a   friendly manner said Br Hosea I think your course in the store was   not calculated to dignify your office as Captain of the policee and as   a member of the Seventies he would then have recieved it vary   different from what he did. I know it is natural for Br Hill to tan-  talize, but that is no excuse for Br Hosea Stout to fight him, he should   have said I am a peace maker and magnifyed his office with dignity   & honor but instead of that he desended to the spirit of a tantilizer   & fell to fighting & swearing. Policeemen should be men of more noble   minds than to desend to such things, or suffer their spirits to mingle   with such low degrading things, Hosea Stout did desend to anger &   swearing which was disgraceful to a Policee man and men that   will practice such things are not fit for policeeman I know the   policeemen here are not Just right for they will get together for   hours together make fun, toll tales, drick whiskey & get drunk and   that is why they are so angry all the while, and they dont pray  when they come together if they did when they saw fighting &   contention they would do as John Lytle did when he parted Stout   & Hill says he (as he steped between them & shoved one one way & the   other the other way) get out of the way stop your fighting I am a peace  maker & wont have it. I never struck a man in my life though   I have parted many who were fighting I never saw the day but that  I thought to myself to good to strike a man. Now to the Policee I say  stop your baldadash pray with each other now if I have not told   the truth tell me of it. I mean to reprove the Policee if we dont   get better men in the valley I will vote against them, they have   confessed they are angry I want to see the Police officiate in their office   without getting angry if they do not they disgrace their office. I   know how Brother Hosea Stout feels concerning the spirits that murdered  the Prophets & still hang around us, but dont you know that devils   are going to the mountains as well as Saints, we have some of the mea-  nest spirits among us on earth the net has halled in good and bad   and I am watching them continually, and we have some of the   best men with us that swear that are guilty of crime yet they wou-  ld lay down their lives for us & for this cause, there are others who  will not gather with the Saints because they think the church is not pure   enough for them & they think themselves vary pure & will wait untill   the Saints get pure Holy & righteous & during all this time they will   live with the world in the midst of wickedness of every kind & think   it all well. We have good men & bad men among us, but if I see a bad   man or good man that needs reproof I will give it to him but will   I go into a store & strike a man? no would it make him any better? No   but we should be saviors benovelent & kind & imitate the example   of the Savior. men ignorantly fan the flame of mobocracy I have   feelings about it, and often say cut his infernal throat still I do not me-  an any such thing I am not good enough to do such a thing. The God of   Israel was a God of war when Israel went over the read sea & the   enemies followed the Lord commanded the waters to overflow them   and it obeyed when I get good enough then I can fight to If I have   power to command the elements. Isaac Hill ought to have known better   than to have done as he did he is no more fit for a High Priest than   The policee are for their office, when they were by themselves he     
 should have told him of it quietly is it not so Isaac (Isaac yes) I am   not going to decide the case that is for the High Council to do  Br Cutler arose made a speach & gave his decision. Both parties rec[ie]  ved their reproof made their confession which was excepeted President   Young said good would grow out of it council adjourned      March 18, 1848 ~ Saturday      18th ^[FIGURE]^ Wilford Woodruff Jr's birth day.

Pratt, Orson Pratt,  Wilford Woodruff, John Taylor George A Smith, Amasa Lyman  Lyman Wight Ezra T. Benson, in there office as members of  the quorum of the Twelve. Moved and carried unanimously  that we sustain Joseph Young, Levi Hancock, Henry Herriman  Zerah Pulsipher, A. P. Rockwood Benjamin Clapp, Jedadiah M. Grant  as Presidents of the Seventies. Resolved that we sustain Father   John Smith as the Partriarch over the whole Church. President Young  made some remarks concerning appointing the first Presidency. the  spirit of the Lord has been with us & we know what is right it  would have been our right to have appointed the Presidency, the  first conference we held after Joseph death but it was not wisdom   to do it we have now whiped all of our enemies with one hand   tied behind us & now it is time to organize the Church In speaking  upon principle said that an honest man would not be dishonest  neither would they follow such men as Rigdon & Strang, the  sheep would follow such as God sent even the Shepherds while  dishonest men would follow the wolves. The Lord will   rule in his Kingdom. I know how things have been & are and  will be. Some suppose that by appointing a presidency it is  robing some of the rising generation or taking away someones  rights but it is not so. Concerning persecution I will say   that the Lord will cause the wrath of man ^to^ praise him the rema-  inder will the Lord restrain.

 April 7, 1848 ~ Friday      7th Met at 10 oclok meeting opened by prayer and singing.  O Hyde addressed the meeting from the 25 & 26 verses of the  [5] ch of math Agree with thine Adversary quickly while thou art in  the way with them &c The Adversary is some time called the devil  but it is not the case in this instance but while we are together   so many of us we should agree with our brother and settle all  difficulties with each other, while we have an opportunity lest  they will some day come into judgment and if we do wrong  and block up the way of the souls of men esspecially of the  Saints their blood will be required at our hands. And when   the Saints do wrong the devil will reproach the Almighty   for the conduct of his Saints. dont steal it is truly mean  wait untill God gives us the Earth. A little leaven leavens  the whole lump, lie a little, steal a little, swear a little and   man may think all is well. And these things may taste sweet  in the mouth but it will be bitter in the belly and will sting like an  adder I am opposed to any evil men that feel disposed to do evil will  always find an excuse for it but when a man is tempted to do wrong  let him enquire is there any harm in doing this is there any harm in  letting it alone then do right in all things then there will be no evil  to tell upon us many good remarks were made. He was then followed  By Phineas Young who spoke of his mission in the east his inter-  view with O Cowdry and his feelings concerning the Saints.  Joseph Young remarked that no man could go away from our meet-  ings & councils & say that he has not been warned against evil but  has true princ[ip]le taught him. O Hyde read several resolutions  against stealing After the second reading President Young   said that document would give the people the B. C. He said he  wanted to give a little council to O Hyde G. A. Smith & the High Council  and all people will you hear it then let your paper alone & keep pen  off from it and it will save you much trouble, the Innocent will   suffer by it send no man into Missouri for crime but to Ioway  as we are in that state. He expressed his feelings in plain terms  concerning being taken as prisioner at any time while he was  innocent many remarks were made. Adjourned one hour  meeting opened by prayer & singing & prayer. Teams were again  called for H C Kimball spoke upon the subject and brought up  the parable of the Potter, names were taken for teams  remarks were made concerning the wives of the soldiers stoping  here or going on this season it was thought the soldiers would  have to come back for their bounty money and isf so would wish  to find their families here. President Young said he was under   the necessity & obligation to do all he could for them and   what he had was at their command and now what I want to know  is will the Church take this responsibility from off my sholdiers  and let me go free all said yes. A committee of 5 was   appointed to locate the poor, widows &c meeting dismissed.  Philo Dibble exhibited his paintings during the evening At the close of  the exhibition W.

Before us is presented a synopsis or minuature or  commencement of one of the most interesting seeneries ever presen-  ted to man I have visited the national gallery in London which is considerd     
 the best collections of paintings in Europe and there is nothing  in that gallery that will begin to compare with this work when   carried out and as brother Dibble has been moved upon to get  up these paintings I feel to bid him God Speed & if he will get up  the seeneries of this Church commencing at the Begining and go  through it untill now & onward and fit up a gallerry in Zion  It will be the continuation of the rise and Progress of the Church  & Kingdom of God in this last dispensation and will form one  of the most interesting sceneries that can be found in Zion it  is true we are passing through these scenes personally but our  children, future generations, & those who come to visit Zion   will feel deeply interested in this matter and would present to  the view at one glance all the scenes that this Church has passed  through O Pratt followed with few remarks also Joseph Young      April 8, 1848 ~ Saturday      8th Saturday morning Robert Petty addressed the brethren who  were going with him as teamsters for the USA meeting opened by  singing and prayer.

He was followed by O Hyde on the dispute on claims  If a man will not do right if he will trespass upon the claims  of his Brother & will not submit to the decisions of the councils in  this thing then let the injured Brother leave his claim and let  the spirit of the Lord come away with him & let the transgressor  come down to poverty & yet come bending to his injured Brother for  bread and let this be recorded in the Church record and all the peop[le]  said Amen.

He said it was  the oxigen that entered the system that sustained life that we  recieved so much into our bodies each day and that we discha-  rged so much each day we flung of so much oxigen at each  resperation He said the oxigen would meet with the Hydragen  & carbon & create a heat or cholorie & this was the cause of  the heat in man the same as it was with a burning lamp  and if oxigen should scease to be created in man he would  scease to breath or live, He explained the difference in Quantity  of the oxigen created from vegitables or animal food that  animal food produced far more oxigen than vegitable, and  that the body discharged oxigen much faster in cold cou-  ntries than in hot, & in cold weather than in warm and  advised that people subsist more upon animal food in cold  weather than in hot. He had tried it by going without animal food   for years and became convinced that it was injurious to him He  injoyed much better health since he made use of animal food  in cold weather fat meat produces oxigen in far greater  quantities than lean and believes this is one reason of the prevelant  fevers in Hot Countrys & seasons that oxigen is created so  much faster than it discharges that it breaks the law of nature  and the man has to suffer in consequence of it oxigen is also reci-  eved & discharged through the pores of the skin and hence their  was great propriety in keeping the body clean & washing often  He urged the necessity & importance of having all dwelling  houses school & meeting houses & all sleeping rooms well  ventilated our sleeping ho rooms should be the largest rooms in   the house instead of small bedrooms & them closed without  any fresh air, go into a crouded room that is not well  ventilated and the air you breath is poison to the Human  System. Mothers should be careful to se to their children  that they do not lie with their heads coverd up that they   need not breath the air under cover. the faster a person  respires or any creature the oftener he discharges oxigen &  the oftener he needs food & the shorter would be his life  without it A bird can ownly live 3 days without food a man  9 or 12 a child not as long while some anaimals or reptiles  will live three months without it A child needs food much   oftener than a man it respires oftener discharges oxigen ofte-  ner which needs replenishing oftener if a person lives without  food the elements pray upon the body itself to creates oxigen  the flesh waste away & the persons dies, it is the fat of the  bear, the ground hog, & all animals that burrow up for months   without eating that feeds the oxigen & keeps life in the ani-  mal yet when he comes out he is poor. He also recommended   that we put on warm clothing when we begin to feel the  chill of Autum & not wait unill we feel the blast of winter     
 we should eat in the morning before we expose ourselves   to riding in the cold, and if we wished to save hay and   provinder give our cattle & stock warm stables in winte[r]  for it would take much more to sustain the system in   the open air he opposed the principle of air tight stove[s]  they were not healthy and many other remarks were  made by the speaker      I have discoverd in my travels of late in the eastern  states a great exhertion among the people to improve thei[r]  system of education to make it interesting to the youth  & changing the mode of teaching the black board is int  roduced into the schools generally & it is found not  profitable to confine the scholar in one place not more  than an hour & are are giving attention to children of  weak lungs & stomach using gymnastics &c filling the  lungs with air & exploding it suddenly with sounds like  O, Bo, Ba &c loud to exercise the lungs making them stand  strait. I find many good things of this kind among   the people.      But when we look for the things  of the Kingdom of God it appears to me this nation  was never more barren than at the present time their  hearts seem to be bared up they are bound in bands  which are made strong & no man can loose them they  seem to be ripe for the judgments of God and well  they may be inasmuch as they have rejected the gospel  shed the blood of Prophets Apostles & Patriarchs & driven  the church & Kingdom of God into the wilderness and have  finally been cut off from the Church & kingdom of   God by a general vote & acclemation of the the Saints  of God with uplifted hands to heaven in the Temple of  the Lord at Nauvoo and who can expect to get access to  the hearts of this Nation now No one their condemnat  ion is made shure & their damnation slumbereth not      September 20, 1848 ~ Wednesday      [FIGURE] 20th We rode to Scarborough carried Rhoda Foss with  [FIGURE] us, spent the night at Fathers Carters I recieved  three letters, from I.

I have felt  that some one has prayed much for me of late, I wonder if it  was Phebe I know you pray much for me I feel its power  and prize it much. I have never felt such a desire to prove  worthy of your Confidence and trust, shun evry appearance of  evil, keep out of the path of all temptation, and do right  in all things as I have of late. I have had much of the   spirit of Secret Prayer, have poured out my soul in suppli-  cation before God with tears of Joy, while the visions of my  mind have been open at times to see clearly my duty to my  God to my Wife and Children, to the Saints and world at large  I have also seen of late the awful certain judgments of   God which like a gathering storm are ready to burst upon the  whole gentile world esspecially this Nations, who have herd the  sound of the gospel, rejected it with all the testimony of the  servents of God, have stoned and killed the Prophets are  drunk with the blood of marters and Saints and at last have   driven the entire church & kingdom of God with the Priesthood  and Keys of eternal life & salvation out of their midst into the  wilderness & the mountains of Israel and by so doing have   turned the last key which seals their condemnation which  lingereth not and their damnation which slumbereth not  therefore they cannot escape. Not ownly the Holy Ghost but  that portion of the spirit of God that enlighteneth evry man  that cometh into the world, like a faithful embassador has finished   his work and is rapidly taking its flight from Gentile America  and wo, wo, wo is their DOOM     
 The following verses I penned to my wife at Norwark Ct Oct 18th 1848      When shall I hear from my dear wife  From those poor suffering pilgraims too  Whose prayers shield me from that strife  Which daily flow from sin and wo      It learns me how to prize their worth  When I am from them far away  Earthly honors could not call me forth  Or make me leave them for so long a day      But O a message I am call to bear  For Him who gave and holds my life  In many a sacrafize I'm call to share  Often to leave my Sons, my Daughters, and my wife      O my Father shield them with thy power  Behold their earnest prayers which mount on high  Let Heavens watchers guard their silent bower  Answer their prayers and note their evry sigh      Their faith thou hast ever seen  Their sufferings Thou alone dost Know  None but Thee can tell what all their trials have been  Since they were wandering pilgraims here below      O my Father guard them through all time to come  Let their days and years be lengthend out  O call them not to leave my earthy home  But make a Heaven of my humble cot      May they fulfill all their visit here  As did their LORD then rise to reign  Inthroned in glory beyound the reach of fear  Or sickness sorrow death or pain      O! God forgive the past keep me from future Ill  Let light, wisdom, truth and virtue fill my heart  Prepare me for that glory which doth the Heavens fill  From the most holy anointed vows may I never part      O give me power to honor those noble treasures given  As the first pillars to build my Kingdom on  Help me to firmly stand with them in Heaven  That I may prove a true and faithful son      Then I will reign with my Dear wife and Children to  With Joseph and Hiram and all of Abrams seed  I'll shout Hosannah to God and the Lamb with all who go  From their graves with the redeemed of our DEAD

After which lengthy   speaches were made by the Mayor and Mr Hale at   the close of the speaches the Mayor arose and said   Fellow Citizens it is proposed to admit the waters of   Lake Cochituate into the city. All those in favor will  say AYE. The response was in a voice of thunder.   The signal was then given and upwards gushed a pure   column of water 8 inches in diameter 80 feet into the   air & fell again into the pond, the cheering of the people   at this moment was overwhelming. The night was   passed with fire works & illuminations while beholding   these things going on the words of the Lord came with   wait upon my mind which says "Broad is the road that  leads to death & thousands flock together there while wisdom   shows a narrow path with here and there a traveller"   [FIGURE] I went to Brother A Badlams & spent the night I got 3   letters from Philo Dibble N.

And I find   [FIGURE] Gold from the publications of the day that the signs of  the times are fulfilling many of the ancient as well as  modern Revelations and Prophesies. Thrones are cast  down, all governments of the Earth are tottering from their  foundations Anarchy & confuscion are begining to reign, Hatred  strife and war are begining to be poured out upon the children  of men. In the midst of this order of things, the Latter   Day Saints discover vast quantities of Gold at the base of  the mountains of Israel in the valley of the sacramento in  upper Calafornia. And not ownly the people of the United  States but of other nations ketch the sound of Gold Gold &  tens of thousands are rushing forward evry way in their  power to get to the gold country as a horse would rush to  battle, but the amount of Gold, silver, coper &c discoverd  in that Country indicates that the worldd of the Lord spok[e]  by Isaiah will be fulfilled, when He says that "for Brass He  will bring Gold, for Iron I will bring silver, for wood brass  for stones Iron,["] &c truly this is an age big with Events  Companies are forming in all most all parts of the United  States and ships in all our ports prepareing to take the   people to the Bay of San Francisco which is ownly 20 miles  from Capt Sutters Fort whare the Mormon gold digings commenced  and It seems as though all the world thought of at the present  time was to obtain gold. Though the Cholera has commen[ce]d  spreading in New York once more, yet the gold panic is  so much greater then the fear of the Cholery that it is  hardy noticed.      Among the letters which I obtained yesterday was one from  O Hyde who informed me that Olover Cowdery had come  back to the Church had made satisfaction and was voted to  come in by the door of Baptism.

All the Nations of the Earth at the present time  both Jew & Gentile Are presenting to the eye of men scenes that were  unlooked ^for^ by the ignorant or learned, the Philosopher, Asstronomer  Poet, Divine, Editor, Dr, Lawyier Statesman, President, Ruler King  Prince or Pope, which events are ownly understood by the man   of God inspired by the power of God & the gift of the Holy Ghost  such an one can perfectly understand the present signs of   the times. He can see the fulfillment of the words of the Lord  begining to present themselves according to the prediction of all  the Holy Prophets since the world began, such are the ownly  class who have faith in the litteral fulfillmen of all the Reve-  lations of Jesus Christ in the last days. They are the ownly  ones who understand their fulfillment as the events are passing  before them, or that have cause to rejoice therein, to all others  the Sequel of the present signs of the Times are hid behind the  veil of doubts Darkness and uncertainty      December 29, 1848 ~ Friday to December 30, 1848 ~ Saturday      29th & 30th We had a heavy snow storm I spent the time reading &  writing I perused the New York Herald to Dec 30 which contained inte-  resting ite[m]s spoken of in following pages      December 31, 1848 ~ Sunday      31s Sunday the last day of the year of AD 1848 A synopsis of my Journal  will be found on a following Page     
 THUS ends the Year of eighteen hundred and forty eight   A Year big with events, a year in which the fig tree   hath rapidly put forth her leaves & blossomed for the summer  A year which has lade the foundation for the fulfillment of   more Prophesy & Revelation than has been fulfilled in whole   centuries in other ages. Thrones have been cast down, whole   Kingdoms have been overturned, the power of the Pope of Rom[e]   laid prostrate & he driven from his Kingdom. All the nations of   the Earth convulsed Revolutions, wars anarchy & confusion follo[w]   each other in rapid succession, Cholera, plagues, & famine follow   in the train. And last of all though not least in importance ◊  is the foundation laid for the disolution of the American   Government while these things are going on the Jews are gathe[r]-  ing home to rebuild Jerrusalem, some 7000 Latter Day Saint[s]   have gatherd into the valley of the mountains of Israel by the   Grate Salt Lake, and the Saints of the valley of the Sacramento   have discoverd vast quantites of Gold, silver, coper Iron & other   mettels the report of which has spread like electricity through   through the world which is causing tens of thousands of the   world to flock to that place these are some of the features   of the signs of 1848   The revolutions of Europe commenced with France. The people   rose in mass had 3 days fight, at the end of which they drove Louis   Philipi King of the French out of France with all the Royal family   the People entered the Turrelles took the Throne upon their   shoulders carried it into the streets & dashed it to peaces upon the   ground. The people then undertook to esstablish a republican   government, it was said to be ownly 500 killed in the first 3 days   fight Afterwords a reaction took place with a fight & some   15000 killed, they have finally organized, and the world are now looking   Daily for the account of their electing a President and it is expected   by many that much blood will be shed on the occasion in consequence   of the many conflicting Parties. The Jerman States and Prusia next   follow in Revolution which is still unsetled. Next the People of   Austria arose and Drove the King from his Throne & Kingdom He   afterwards returned with Armies and bombarded Vienna 8 days   and regained his Kingdom but has been driven to the necessit[y] of   giving his people a milder form of government & more toleration   still his Throne is in danger. The Emperor of Rusia has had   much war and his Throne is in danger. The Irish have   made a Struggle to throw of[f] the Brittish yoak & they have failed   yet deep trouble is brewing for that nation. The inhabitants   of Rome have risen up in their strength and compelled the   pope to make change after change, and at last have dashed his   power to the Earth assassinated his Councellors and Driven him   from his Papal seat which has never before been shaken for   the last fourteen hundreds years and he has had to seek prot-  ection by fleeing to other Nations. While this is going on in for-  eign Countries let us turn our eyes for a moment to the Position  of Blood Stained America. A Nation though blessed above all   other Nations under Heaven yet she has of late been guilty of sheding   the Blood of Apostles Prophets Patriarchs and Saints she has suffered   mob rule to take the place of Constitution law & order and what   position is she in at the Close of this year, not ownly one of her  states Ohio has disgraced herself by having a legislaton sit for     
 weeks & spend their time in fighting for the mastery instead of   organizing & doing the business of the people, but the leaders of the   whole Nation itself at Washington are engender[ing] the spirit of party   strife, hatred disunion & war meeting in seperate parties and   laying plans for the dissolving of the Union and the anhilation   of the American Government. And James Gordon Bennett of   the New York Herald & other Editors after Prophesying month after   month that their was no danger of disolving our union are with   all their prophesies recorded in their paper stareing them in the   face, under the necessity of recording the account of the parties   ways and means made use of to accomplis & bring to pass the vary  things they have been prophesying against. And while the Senators   & Statesman of the Slave states meet in convention and resolve that   if slavery in the Distrect of Columbia is abolished or prohibited   from New Mexico or Calafornia that they will immediately dissolve   the Union, lay taxes upon the shiping of the free States &c At the   same time Citizens and Statesmen of the free states meet in conven-  tion and Resolve if these things are not done they in like manner   will dissolve the Union. While these parties are growing more &   more determined, & further & wider apart. Still the public mind   seems to be blinded as to the result of these resolutions, and are   ignorant concerning the fruit which will be produced by the seed of  there own sowing yes they have "eyes but see not, ears but hear not &   hearts but do not understand" while the servent of God wfilled with  inspiration, can behold the scene in its true light and knows well   the result, with as much certainty as Noah, Lot, and Jesus,   did each in their day while gazing upon the conduct of the Anted-  eluvians, Sodom & Gomorrow, or the inhabitants of Jerrusalem and   as the words of the Lord were fulfilled in the former case in like   manner will they in the latter. [##Matthew 13:15##] During the past year the Asiactic   cholera one of the plagues of the last days has also again commenced   its march through the Earth slaying its tens of thousands. it has now   made its appearance in England & Scotland and has just arived   in the United States is in New York New Orleans Mobeal Memphis   and Cincinnati the last report states about 100 daily in New Orleans   the signs of the gathering of the Jews has been vary prominant during   the past [year], the governments of the world have in some measure been   exherted to favor that people. And while I turn my eye towards Zion  I can see the Lord is favoring her. The Church of Jesus Christ   of Latter Day Saints has been organized with a first Presidency   of three viz Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, and Willard Richards,   who have gatherd to the mountains of Israel in the valley of the   Great Salt Lake took with them about 3000 souls & some 8000   head of cattle of all kinds which now makes a population of about   7000 saints in the City of the Great Salt Lake Great Bason North   America. The Saints who were located near the Bay of San   Francisco have found a vast amount of welth in mines, such   as Dimonds, Gold, Silver, quick silver, platina, copper, lead, tin, zink   Iron &c, these things have been found to such an extent that it is   creating great excitement throughout the world esspecially in   the United States and tens of thousands are flocking to that land.  Crime of Evry kinsd has apparently increased 100 per ct throughout the   United States and the cup of their iniquity is full and the hour of   their Judgment is come Calamity sorrow & Death has recieved its comm-  ission to visit this land. And the spirit whispers to me that eighteen   hundred & forty nine will lay waste many thousands of the inhabitants   of the Earth esspecilly of this land by Cholera fire plage and Judgments     
 40 Ironmonger Row Saint Lukes London Jan 7th 1841    Elder G. A. Smith    Dear Brother    I Receieved your letter under  Date of Dec 31st & I set down this evening to answer  it. I do not feel disposed to take up a great  deal of this Sheet in speaking of things  in this country for I have not much  knews to write about things here I will merly  say however that we expect to Baptize a  number in few days & Doctor copeland  among the Number, But it is the hardest  case I ever saw to pick up Saints in London  We had a hard tempest in the city last  Sunday morning that done considerable  damage to the churches &c. & also great damage  done in a late Storm in the Black Sea 18 Greek  3 English & a greater number of other vessels  were entirely destroyed & all on Board. Elder Wm  Pitt has Began to Baptze in Ipswich but how  many I do not know. Now for American News  We Received 6 letters to day 3 of them were from  Nauvoo & Montrose, from R. B. Thompson  Vilate Kimball & Phebe W. Woodruff & I suppose  probably you have got one by this time, they  were Brought from Nauvoo by the two Brother  that went from Longton Lancashire, to spy out the  Land & Saints Sister Kimball said they took much  pains to acquaint themselves with things in that, place  & when they came away they offered to bring letters or papers to  any of us in England & so these letters came by them to  Preston & were Mailed to us in London & I expect they 
 they brought sumthing for you if so give us the news  the latest Date was Nov 7th at which time Elder Turley  had not arived, the Saints were mostly well, my Babe  was still sick with the Ague, & one of Sister Kimballs  Children also, the work was progressing General Adams  at Springfield, had come to Nauvoo & was Baptized  Elder O Smoot had returned home from the South.  several late deaths among the Saints, Brother Badger, &  Widder Gibbs she that was a Carter is dead. The Missourians  are still constantly committing depredations upon  the Saints they kidnaped anothr Brother by the name  John Taylor, & hand cuffed him & chained him  to the floor in a Joal, but he got some fire some  way & burned the staple out, & broke though two doors  strongly bolted with his hand cuffs on & got away leaving  the gail on fire it was severel weeks ago & he has not been  herd of since. his friends feel bad for fear that he has  perished in the wilderness. Governour Boggs is determined  to send force enough to Nauvoo to take all the prisioners  he has demanded, & since the Saints have. Hark  the Postman has this moment brought me in a letter  from Elders Whittaker & G. A. Smith so I see you have  got a letter as well as me. My wife did not give  me much News ownly the same that you have, you  wish the papers I herd bother G. A. Smith has the Numbers  all of the Last now in Manchester & I expected you would  have had them before this time. We have none of them  now by us, they are at Mr Sangivanni & I dont  know when I shall go there again. Our wives 
 seem vary anxious to have us come home  once more Phebe sayes their is a small brach  of 50 members in the Neighbourhood where she  is Wm O Clark is president over it says they have  good meetings. (Governor Carling has changed  his feelings towards the Saints becaus they support  the whigs so they need not look to him for much  help) I should think it was about time for Elder  Turley to get to Nauvoo. Sister Kimball herd from Kirtland  the Saints were well there. John Young was about  to start for England. Phebe says she herd that  O Hide & J. E. Page was not agoing to sail from  New York untill they had $2000 dollars to help them  to Jerrusalem & back. I expect America & all  the genti[le] [page torn] world will see some overturns in less [than] [page torn]  1000 years, yes a good deal less, give my resp[ects] [page torn]  to Brothr & Sister Whittaker Brothr & Sister Amison  Brother & Sister Ridge, Sister E Bromley & all the Saints  in Lane End & evy where els you see & may  the Lord give you health & strength & grace  according to your day in all things.

 History of Wilford Woodruff    In traceing the history of my Fathers I find it difficult to obtain a satisfactory   account of the Woodruff family (from whom I descended) for more than   three generation. I learn from the English Book of Heraldry that    Woodruff supposed to be one of my Ancestors was Lord Mayor  of the City of London at the time of the great fire in AD 1649 My Great   Grand Father Josiah Woodruff lived nearly one hundred years of age and   possessed a strong Iron Constitution and performed a great amount of   manual labour nearly up to the time of his death. His wifes name was   Sarah. He had by her nine children as follows Josiah, Appleton, Eldad  Elisha, Joseph, Roda, Phebe & 2 names not given. One of his daughters married  married a Chase the other a man by the name of North  My Grandfather Eldad Woodruff was the third son of Josiah   Woodruff. He was born ^in Farmington Hartford County Connecticut^ in 1751. He like his father possessed a   strong constitution it was considered ^said^ that he performed the   most manual labor for several years of any man in Hartford   County Ct. but from over exertion in hewing timber he had a  severe ^was^ attack of the ^with^ rheumatism in his right hip which caused a  severe lameness in his righ for several years before his death  He married Dinah Woodford by whom he had 7 children as follows  Eldad, Elizabeth, Samuel, Aphek, Titus, Hellen, & Ozem.   Eldad Married Lewey Woodford, Elizabeth Amasa Frisby. Samuel Miss Case,  Aphek Bulah Thompson, & Azubah Hart. Titus Louisa Allan, Hellen Amos  Wheeler & Ozem Acksa Merrill & Hannah Hart, all of which had a  numerous families of children. My Grand Father died ^in Farmington Ct^ with an attack of the  ^the^ spotted fever in 1806 aged 55 years. My Grand Mother Dinah Woodruff  died in 1824 ^aged the same place^ in Farmington Ct with a cancer in the left breast. Her sufferings   were very great.    My Father Aphek Woodruff was born in Farmington Hartford County Ct   November 11th 1778.  Married Bulah Thompson who was born 1782 Married Nov 29, 1801  by whom he had three children, Azmon, born Nov 29 1802. Ozem Thompson born   Dec 22nd 1804. Wilford born March 1st 1807. My Mother Bulah Woodruff died   with an attack of the spoted fever June 11th 1808 aged 26 years leaving me 15 months   old at her death. My Father married for his second wife Azubah Hart Nov born July 31st   18 1792 Married Nov 9th 1810, by whom he had 6 children 
 watching my footsteps in order to find some opportunity to take my life from  the Earth but I can ownly attribute the continuation of my life on Earth  to the present time to a merciful God whose hand has been streched out & rescued  me from death in the midst of the many dangers and hair breadths escapes which I   have passed through in life some of which I will here mention    When three years of age I fell into a caldron of boiling water was instantly caught out  & so badly scalded that is was 9 months before I was considered out of danger. When  five years of age I fell from the great beam of a barn upon my face upon the beam floor  which came near breaking my neck three months afterwards I broke one of my  arms falling down a pair of stairs.  I soon broke the other arm falling out of   a high stoop across some timber. When six years of age I came near being killed  by a surly bull and was ownly saved as it were by a miracle. During the same year  I went into my Fathers saw mill with several other children I got upon the head block  to take a ride while running the carriage back not anticipating any danger but before  I was aware of it my leg was caught between the head block & fender post & broak  both bones in two below the knee I was taken to the house & lay 9 hours before my  bones was set which time was spent amid severe pain: but being young my bones  soon nit together & in few weeks I was again upon my feet attending to the sports of  my youth. During my confinement with this lameness my brother Thompson was my  companion in the same room going through with a course of the typus fever  When 7 years of age I was riding on the top of a load of hay which my Uncle  Ozem Woodruff was driving to the barn when he turned the load over on top of   me and before it was I was nearly strangled for the want of air before it was removed  from me. While 8 years of age I was riding in a one horse waggon with   several others to go to our labor the horse took fright ran down a steep hill and   turned us over with the waggon on top of us. But again while in the midst of danger  my life was preserved none of us was seriously injured. While 9 years of age I clumb ^climbed^  into an Elim tree to obtain some bark. I steped upon a dry tree limb and I fell  about 15 feet upon my back which apparently beat the breath out of my body a cousin  ran & told my parents I was dead, before they arrived at the spot I came to my senses  arose upon my feet & met my Parents coming to me. At 12 years of age I  was drowned in Farmington River & sunk in 30 feet of water and was miraculously  saved by a young man named Bacon, I suffered much in being restored to life  At 13 years of age while passing through Farmington meadows in the depth of   winter with the roads drifted with snow and in an exceeding blustering day I became 
 Became so chilled & overcome with cold I could not travel, I crawled into the  hollow of a large tree to rest me. A man in the distance seeing me go into it  hastened to my ^rescue^ realizeing more fully than I did the danger I was in when he arrived  at the spot I had fallen asleep & was nearly insensible, he had much difficulty in  arousing me to a sens of my situation. He procured means to convey me to my  Fathers house and through a kind profidence my life was again preserved    At 14 years of age I split my left instep open with an ax which went nearly   through my foot & ^it^ was 9 months getting well. At 15 years of age I was bitten in   my left hand by a mad dog in the last stage of the Hydrophobia. He ownly clamped  my hand with his teeth but did not draw blood and I was preserved through  the mercy of God from an awful death. At the age of 17 I met with an accident  which caused me much suffering & came near ending my life. I was riding a very  ill tempered horse which I was not acquainted with, and while going down a very steep  rocky hill the horse took the advantage of the ground suddenly leaped from the road & ran  down the steepest part of the hill amid the thicket & the rocks at full speed and he commenced  kicking up at the same time & about landing me over his head among the rocks but I lodged  on the top of his head grasped one hand hold of each ear as with a death grasp expecting evry  moment to be dashed to peaces against the rocks while in this position sitting astride his neck  with no bridle to guide him but his ears he plunged down the hill among the rocks with all  force ^speed^ untill he ran against a rock which dashed him to the Earth I went over his head  & the rock about one rod & struck the ground square upon my being the ownly thing  visible that saved my life, for had ^I^ struck upon any othe part of my body it must have   killed me instantly, as it was my boenes bones crushed from under me as though they  were reeds. It broke my left leg twice in two & put out both of my ancles in a   shocking manner, and the horse came nigh rolling over me in his struggles to  get up. ^My uncle Titus Woodruff saw^ An uncle of mine saw me fall, hastened to my relief got amist me &  & carried me to his house in an arm chair, I lay from 2 oclok till 10 at night  without ^medical aid^ assistance then my Father arrived bringing Dr T Swift of Farmington with him  who set my bones boxed up my limbs & carried me in his carriage 8 miles that   night to my Fathers house my sufferings were very great yet I had good attention  & in 8 weeks I was outdoors upon my cruches & soon was all well again  In 1827 while attending the Flouring Mill attempting to clear the ice out of a water  wheel standing upon the wheel with one arm around the shaft a man hoisted the gate  let a full head of water upon it as soon as the water struck it it stopped my feet  sliped into [word covered] I immediately plunged head fore most over the rim of the 
 wheel into about 3 feet of water and my weight drew my legs  out of the wheel or I should have been drawn under a shaft & crushed   to death. In 1831, while having charge of the Flouring Mill in Collinsv-  ville Ct I was standing inside of a breast wheel 20 feet in diameter  upon one of the arms near the top clearing out the ice when a full head of   water was let onto it it immediately started. I dropped my ax and leaped  through the wheel to the bottom of it by the shaft & arms about 20 feet as I struck  the bottom of the wheel I was rolled out against a ragged stone well with ownly   about 2 feet clearance between it & the wheel the wheel caught me & rolled ^me^ out  into the water below where I found myself without any broken bones but with  some bruises & much fright. ^*see paper apart^ In 1833 the day I was baptized into the  Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints one of my horses newly calked  kicked my hat of my head & had he struck 2 inches lower would probably   have killed me instantly. In 10 minutes afterwards while driving the same horses  down a hill on a sled without any box the bottom boards sliped forward  under the roll caught the ground turned endways fell on the horses badly  throwing me between the horses they ran to the bottom of the hill draging me  by the lines head foremost with the steed top of me about rods over  a smooth snow path I escaped unharmed however in the midst of both dangers  In 1834, while travelling in Zions Camp to Missouri a rifle was accidentally  discharged & the ball passed through three tents with a dozen men in each & lodged  in a waggon axletree with a man standing against it it injured no one. It passed within  a few inches of my breast & many others escaped as narrowly as my self    A few months afterwards a musket was accidentally snaped with the muzzle pointing at  my breast within a few feet of me heavily loaded with buck shot but it missed fire  and my life was again preserved.  In April 1839 in Rochester Ill I was riding  upon the running gears of a waggon without any box, I was sitting upon the fore ward  axletree and the bolt came out fastening the cupling pole this left the hind wheels & my  weight on the forward bolster & tongue turned the coupling pole clear over onto the horses  backs, turned the stakes upside down & shut me up fast between the boulster & tongue  but in such a manner that my head & shoulders dragged on the ground my horses  took fright and ran out into an open pari prairie & thus draged me in this position  for about half a mile when I managed so as to guide them with my left hand so   as to to run them into a corner of a high worm fence where we landed in a pile  together, I was considerably bruised but landed withou escaped without any broken bones 
 see paper apart*  & after one days rest was enabled to attend to my labors again (see paper apart)  Thes I have occupied considerable space in refering to those peculiar circumstances  which have attended me during life. And to sum the matter up it stands about those  I have broaken both legs (one twice in two) both arms, & both ancles ^my breast bone & 3 ribs^ ^my breast bone & 3 ribs^ have been   drowned froze & scalded, & bit with a mad dog, have been in two water wheels under  a full head of water *  ^have passed through several severe fits of sickness encountered poison in the worst forms, landed in a pile of rail road ruins have bearly missed the passing bullet^ I have passed through a score of other hair breadth escapes &  Yet the protection & mercy of God has been over me, and my life there from has  been preserved upon the Earth for which blessing I feel to render the gratitude  of my heart to my Heavenly Father praying that the remained of my days may be spent  in his service and the building up of his kingdom *) ^It has appeared mirraculous to me that with all the injuries and broaken bones which I have met with with I have^ not a lame limb about me but have ever since  been enabled to endure  the ever since the hardest labour and exposures and journies have ^often^ walked 40, 50 and on one  occasion 60 miles in a day  At an early age my mind began to be ^was^ exercised upon religious subjects. But  I never made a profession of religion untill 1830, being 23 years of age I did not then   join any church ^for the reason that I could not find any^ for the reason body of people or denomination or Church whos  had for their foundation, doctrin, tenets, faith or practice, ^agreed with^ the gospel of Jesus Christ or   the ordinances ^&^ gifts & practices which Christ & the Apostles taught  & practiced ^in their day^  in there day & generation for the salvation of the children of Man Although the   teachers of the day taught that the faith, gifts, graces, miracles, & ordinances which   the prophets, Savior & the Apostles enjoyed were done away & no longer needed I did   not believe a word of it to be true ownly as they were done away through the unbeliefs  of the children of men I believed the same gifts graces miracles & power would be   manifest the same in one age of the world as in another when God did have a Church   & kingdom upon the Earth, I did not believe that the Church of Christ did exist   upon the Earth in an organized form, but I believed there had been a falling away  from the Apostolic order of things,  but that the Church & kingdom of God would be  esstablished upon the Earth in my day & generation and that I should live to see it.   This principle was rivited upon my mind from two causes 1st from the perusal of the   Old & New Testament with fervent prayer that the Lord would show me what was   right & wrong & lead me in the path of salvation, without any regard to the opinions of man  & the whisperings of the spirit of the Lord unto me for the space of three years did teach ^taught^  me in accordance with the ^written^ word of God that He was about to set up his Church & Kingdom   upon the Earth in the last days ^and that his "righteousness was about to be revealed & his salvation to come forth"^ ^as said the Prophet Isaiah in his 56 chapter^ And secondly I was taught this principle from my youth  up to manhood by an aged man by the name of Robert Mason who lived in Simsbury   Ct who was frequently called the old prophet Mason, ^who taught^ who did teach me many things   which are now coming to pass. He prophesied of many of those events which are now take  place. He did not believe that any man upon the Earth in the midst of the Christian Nations 
 ^Had authority^ to administer in the ordinances of the House of the Lord but believed that it was our  privilege through faith, prayer, & fasting to heal the sick, & cast out devils by the laying on of   hands which was the case under his administration as numbers could testify.  I was living in this state of mind & in this faith & belief looking for the coming forth of  the Church of Christ when I heard of what was called Mormonism. In 1832 I  was loudly called upon by the spirit of the Lord to go to the state of Rhode Island one of  my brother ^Asahel^ was also called to go to the same place & at the same time when we met  we both told our feelings & what the spirit of the Lord had whispered unto us & we marvelled   & wondered what the Lord wanted of us in Rhode Island, but as we had made preparations   to move to the west we let outward circumstances controll us, and like Jonah instead of going to   Ninivah went to Tarshis, so we instead of going to Rhode Island went to Richland Oswego County  N. York, and there remained until the 29 day of Dec 1833 before I heard a gospel sermon  by a latter day saint.  I then soon learned what the Lord wanted of us in Rhode Island  for at the time we were commanded ^warned^ of the Lord to go there, two of the Elders of the Latter day  Saints were preaching there & had we gone we certainly should have embraced the  work at that time, but as it was we had to wait for the next call  On the 29th day of Dec 1833, Elder Zera Pulsipher & Elijah Cheeny called  at my house & gave out an appointment for preaching in the school house in that  neighborhood that [illegible] evening I attended as did my brother Azmon Woodruff  We both believed, invited the Elders to our home & offered ourselves  for baptism the first sermon we heard. We read the Book of Mormon  & had a testimony that it was true. And on the 31 day of Dec 1833 I was  baptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints under the hands  of ^by^ Elder Zera Pulsipher & confirmed the same evening under his hands  On the 2nd day of January 1834 I was ordained to the office of a teacher  & my eldest brother Azmon Woodruff an Elder & a small branch organized  of 12 members all under the hands of ^by^ Elder Pulsipher. In the month of February  I walked in company with Elder Holton some 60 miles to the town of Fabeus to attend   an evening meeting of the Saints in that place where Elder Pulsipher was presiding.   here ^I^ saw for the first time the Book of Commandments or revelations given through   Joseph Smith and I believed them with all my heart & rejoiced therein & after   spending two days with them we returned home rejoicing several days with them &  holding several meetings we returned home rejoicing. During the winter we were visited by   several of the Elders among whom ^was^ Elder Harry Brown in February. He again called upon   us about the first of February ^1834^ accompanied by Elder Parley P. Pratt it being the first 
 time I had ever seen him  we appointed a meeting for him to speak to our  little branch, ^He instructed [illegible] us the branch^ and we had a precious time, he spoke till near midnight. He was upon  an important mission in connexion with Lyman Wight, it was to gather up from  100 to 5000 men ^a company^ to go up to redeem Zion. I accompanied Brother Pratt to Jefferson   County, I told him my circumstances. He said it was my duty to try to prepare myself   to go to Kirtland & join the Camp of Zion. According to his council I went to with  all my might & settelled all my accounts ^business^ & business and on the 11 day of April  1834 I bid my friends farewell, & took a pair of horses & waggon & took with  me Brothers Harry Brown & Warren Ingles, & started for Kirtland Ohio.  I met with Orson Pratt, John Murdoch, and other Elders on the way & arrived   in Kirtland on the 25th of April 1834, where I f was introduced to the prophet Joseph  the first time I had ever seen him. He invited me to make his house my home  which kind offer I excepted of & staid with him about one week. I have for  the first time became acquainted not ownly with the Prophet Joseph & his family but  with many of the High Priests, Elders & Saints which I had never before seen  I spent one Sabbath in Kirtland & heard many of the ^leading^ Elders speak & I felt to rejoice   before God for the light & knowledge which was manifest to me during that day  through the preaching of the Elders of Israel. According to appointment I left Kirtland  upon the 1st day of May with a part of the company went to New Portage  where we remained untill all the company came up joined us, from Kirtland & we  were organized.  Then on the 7th day of May we took up our march like the Children  of Israel pitching our tents by the way, & travelled to Missouri according to  the account already spoken of in the Church History, which was called ^the Camp of^ Zions  Camp which went up to redeem Zion & assist those persecuted brethren.  Our whole journey, manner of travelling, incidents upon the way, the way the Lord fought   our battles with hail & storm, at Crooked River, the visitation of the cholera to  our camp, the death & burial of the Saints &c has all been published in the Church  History. we arrived After we had pitched our tents in Clay County Missouri  ^our numbers being 205^ & many of the Brethren had been taken sick & some had died Joseph requested the   camp to dispersed except enough to take care of the sick all who had teams were   required to leave the ground & go among the brethren I went to Brother Lyman   Wights in company with Heman Hyde & Milton Holmes. After a few days  Joseph called the ^Brethren^ people to gather at Lyman Wights and told the people ^them^ if they would   humble themselves before the Lord & covenant to keep His commandments & obey   his council the plague should be stayed from that hour, & their should not be another 
 case of cholera in the camp. The people ^brethren^ covenanted to do this & the plague   was stayed & there was not another case in camp. Joseph held several meetings  with the ^Saints^ Saint Set them in order, & ^President Joseph Smith^ returned home with many other of the brethren  I remained with Lyman Wight laboring with my hands till the following winter. * ^(*see paper apart & page 9th)^  At a meeting of the High Council at Lyman Wights in Clay County Missouri  I was ordained to the office of a Priest * ^* By the direction of the High Council under the hands of Brother Simeon Carter on the 5 day of Nov 1834^ in I had a great desire in my  heart to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ to my fellow men for I saw such  blessings, beauty & glory in it that I had a great desire to assist my brethren  in proclaiming it to the inhabitants of the Earth t and this desire continued  to increase upon me, but I did not reveal my feelings to any man, but soon  ^(the above lines are in paper apart {[shorthand?]} 32)^  after I was ordained to the office of a priest I received an ^appointment^ mission by Bishop  Edward Partridge to go in connexion with Elder Harry Brown on a mission  through the Southern part of Missouri & through the Arkansas, into the Southern  States Agreeable to ^my^ this appointment I bid my brethren farewell in Clay  County & on the 13th day of January 1835 I took my valise in hand weighing  15 lbs mostly Books of Mormon & started in company with Elder Harry ^Brown^ without  without purse or scrip & crossed the ferry ^river^ into Jackson County, * ^* as we stepped onto the bank two horsmen le^a^d there horses onto the bank they eyed us very closely but said^ ^nothing to us^ we stopped south  open our mission This was the first & last time that we ever trod the soil of  Jackson County, we felt thankful for the privilege & we bowed our knees before  the Lord & offered up the gratitude of our hearts unto our Father in heaven for  the privilege & prayed for his protection whi from the mob while going through  the county as the Saints had just been driven out and ^as^ a Latter Day Saint perriled  his life to found in the county, we prayed that the judgments of God might  rest upon the wicked who had shed the blood of the Saints in that land that their  blood might be avenged & that the land might be cleansed from sin wicked-  ness & abominations & redeemed that the Saints might again inherit it  we arose & went on our way rejoiceing. I had in my possession  a petition to the Governor of Missouri for redress of wrongs done us in   Jackson County for the purpose of obtaining signat[ure] unto it we bent our   way south through Jackson County without any harm yet in one instance we   were miraculously preserved from a large mob ^of about 60^ assembled at a grog shop which we   had to pass. On the 18th Jan we called at the Harmony Mission had an interview   with the president of the mission a Presbyterian minister, it was near sun down  he would neither give us any thing to eat nor keep us because we were mormons  it was 15 miles to the nearest house which was an ^Jerrews^ Indian traiding house kept 
 kept by a Mr Jerrew, we asked the minister to direct us there. He gave us directi  ^directions^ the Spirit said to me that he was decieving us, directeing us wrong, I asked the question  3 times over & he declaired he was telling us the truth we followed his direction  & it led us into the Osage River swamp where we were lost in the darkness of   the night ^we undertook to follow the river but it being about the crookedest one in earth America we made but slow progress^ ^and^ after travelling through mud & water for one hour we concluded to go   out onto the open prairie & lide lie down in the grass untill morning but when we got   out into the prairie we h[e]ard the Osage Indians drum & shout at the trading house  as they were having a powwow we followed by the sound, & went into  their midst * ^*as we approached we were met by a dozen large savage looking dogs they smelt of us in a friendly manner^ ^but did not try to bite nor bark we arrived about midnight, covered with mud hungry and weary^ we were kindly received by Mr Jerrew fed & lodged for the night  19th Mr Jerrew gave us a good breakfast set us across the Osage River  ^(see paper apart 2nd page 10)^  in a canoe & was started upon our long days walk it being 60 miles to the   nearest house in the direction we were going ^and we had not a morsel of anything with us to eat^ Most of our travels through the day was  through prairie before dark we entered timber timber land as we were approaching  the timber a large black bear came out of the timber & met us we had   no weapons but a small pistol but as the bear got within about 6 rods of us he  rose upon his hind feet & examined us a short time & turned & went off  another course we travelled on as fast as we could we were soon invelloped in   so thick darkness it was with great difficulty that we could keep the road we were  soon surrounded with a large drove of wolves who ^that^ kept up a continual howling  & would freequently rush upon us & come up within a few feet of us we travelled  about one two hours in this situation feeling that we were in danger we concluded   to stop & build a fire & wait till morning. Accordingly we built a large   fire which drove the wolves of & as we were about to lie down we h[e]ard   a dog bark & also a bell, we found we were near a house we took   each of us a brand of fire & in going about one quarter of a mile we   found a ^log hut about 12 feet square^ house occupied by one Mr. Williams who was in Jackson County during the   mobing of the Saints, & he had lately moved to this place depending upon his gun mostly for   his living it being 60 miles to a house on the north of him, & 12 miles on the south  He and his family was living in a small old log house ^hut^ about 12 feet square & one   bed in the room upon which lay his wife several children & 3 young dogs. He lay   stretched out upon the ^bare^ floor with his feet to a small fire there was no door to   the house but a ragged quilt hung up in the door way, it was past 11 oclock at   night I turned away the quilt looked into the house every thing was in sound sleep  I spoke 3 times no one stired not even a dog, I walked in & laid my hand upon   the mans shoulder the mo & spoke to him the moment he felt the wait of   my hand he leaped to his feet & commenced running around the room leaping as high 
 as he could each jump. I told him not to be frightened as we were travellers   & friends & did not wish to hurt him but wished to stop with him him  over night, when he came to his senses we as he gave us permission to   stop with him till morning if we would take the bare floor as he did then  we excepted, we asked for something to eat as we had walked 60 miles with[out] eating a   morsel of food. He said he had nothing for us said that hed had got to kill   game for his breakfast in the morning. He said the cause of his fright was he  he had shot a large panther dead a few nights before standing in his door, & he thought   his mate had lit upon him. We lay down upon the bear floor & we were    glad of this place as it soon began to rain & rained hard through the night  we arose in the morning & went on in the rain 12 miles to a Mr Conners  who was also in the Jackson County mob who gave us a breakfast but damned   us while we were eating because we were mormons & when we had finished a   hearty breakfast we thanked him very politely for it and went our way and left him swareing   ^We did feel thankful for it for we had walked 72 miles without any thing food but very little^  ^see page apart 2 page 11^  We continued travelling preaching by the way without stoping ownly over night, ^or on the^ ^Sabbath^ untill  we got to Petty John Creek in the Arkansas Territory. Here Mr Allexander   Akeman resided with a large family of sons & one daughter all of which we   settelled around him Mr Akeman was a member of the Church in Jackson   County & a part of his family, his wife died strong in the faith in Missouri,  his whole family was mobed some of his sons were whiped severly. But he could   not stand the persecution & the loss of his property. He moved to Arkansas  to get rid of mormonism had apostitised & was bitter against the work, when   we called upon him he opposed us strongly, spoke against the leaders of the Church   & the Book of Mormon. He had one son who received us & had a little   faith I had a dream the night before I went there what we should meet with  & what would transpire. ^relate the dream^ When we met with opposition not ownly by Mr Akeman  but from many in the neighborhood Elder Brown wished to leave the place immediately  & continue his journey I told him I should stay & see my dream fulfilled  we staid in the neighborhood 25 days during which time the Lord brought judgment  upon those who had threatened to mob us & take our lives many of them died suddenly  while we were there and I was warned three times of the Lord to go with Mr  Akeman & bear testimony unto him of the truth of Mormonism & the wickedness  of his course in opposing it & the last time I called upon ^him^ he was filled with wrath   against me & when I left his house he followed me in a rage apparently with some   evil intent when a few rod I had got a few rods from his door he was nearly   treading upon my heels he fell dead at my feet as though he had been   struck with a thunder bolt ^lightning^. He immediately began to swell & turned black 
 this created a great wailing & mourning with his famil, Brother Brown   & myself assisted the family in laying him out & burying him. He died   on the 14th day of Feb 1835 & we buried him on the 16. This clo singular  dispensation of providence brought solemnity upon the people & they began to reflect &  wished to hear preaching, we held several meetings & preached to the people we  baptized a Mr Hubbel & his wife aged people who had opened their doors   & given us a home & just as we had got the people prepared to receive   the Gospel & anxious to learn & pleading with us to stay & preach, Brother   Brown resolved that he would continue his journey south. I was fully satisfied   that should we stop we should build up a Church, & I was convinced it was   our duty to stop but Brother Brown held the office of an Elder I a priest  & we were travelling together upon a mission, & I felt that I must subject  to those over me in the priesthood, so I submitted.  This is an error which   many have committed in this Church who were sent as missionaries to the  world, as soon as they get doors open & a people prepared to receive the gospel  they go away & leave them we left this people with tears in their eyes we left  & Brother Brown did not baptize another person during his whole southern  mission we left them on the 2nd day of March went upon the bank of   the Arkansas River cut down a large cotton wood tree dug out a canoe   4 feet wide 12 feet long put on a pair of oars & rowed down the Arkansas   River 125 miles to Little Rock geting ^beging^ our food by the way a meal at a time  as we had an opportunity, after visiting Little Rock we tied up our canoe ^travelled down the river 10 miles^ on   below Little Rock & tied up our canoe on the East Bank & stoped with a Mr Jones  preached next day at his house on the 16 left our canoe with Mr Jones walked back   ^the East Bank of the Arkansas River & started on foot to ward & wade the Mississippi^  ^Swamp to Memphis Tennessee we travelled on the old military road it was over 200  miles the way we travelled ^up the river 10 miles took the old^ ^the road^ & almost the whole distance was knee deep in mud &  water up the river 10 miles opposite Little Rock & took the old military   road & started to waid the missippi swamp which was mostly covered with   water from Little Rock Arkansas to Memphis Tennessee, a distance of   about 175 miles, we waided through mud & water knee deep day after day & in some instances  40 miles per day before we could get a stoping place. On the 24th while in the   swamp I had an attack of the rheumatism & could not travel but slow  My companion Brother Brown had got in a hurry & wished to hasten to   the Missippi River take boat close up his mission, take boat & return  to his family in Kirtland, & as I could not travel as fast as he   wished so we parted to meet no more for about 3 years he left me siting on   a log in the mud & water I being lame & unable to walk & no food & 12 miles to the 
 nearest house on the road. He went out of sight in great haste I then knelt   down in the water & prayed the Lord to heal me up & the spirit of the Lord rested   upon me & I was healed the pain left me I arose & went my way ^*^ whenever   I met with one or more families I preached to them & bore   my testimony as I went alone to the people I arrived at the Missippi River  & crossed it in the evening of the 27th March 1835 [FIGURE]  (*^after^ that night that ^after^ Brother Brown left me in trying to travel in the night to me he lost  his ^way^ got into a thicket of brambles & tore nearly all of his cloths off from him  He stoped at a cabin & took him nearly all night to mend up his clothes)  [FIGURE] I stoped for the night at a publick house kept by Mr Josiah Jackson I was [illegible]  up for ^of being^ an imposture Mr Jackson believed I was one of Murrells clan ^instead of a Mormon preacher^ who was  then murdering & stealing Negroes through the country & to test the thing he gathered   to gether a large house full of the the wickedest & most corrupt J Gentry in the city  & set me to preaching, to them, to test whether I could preach or not. I do not  think that Mr Jackson or the same company of men & women will ever meet   to gether again for the same purpose to test whether a Mormon Elder could preach or  not for they would not like again to have their sins & abominations revealed to   each other as plainly & pointedly as I told them that night through the inspiration   of the Holy Ghost, they seemed glad to get rid of me upon almost any terms,  I travelled from Memphis to Middle Tennessee. And on the 4th of April  I met with Elder Warren Parish at Father Frys in Benton County ^Middle^ Tennessee  He & David Patten had been labouring to gether through the winter in Tennessee they had   baptized some 20 or 30 persons Elder Patten had returned to Kirtland at that time  before I arrived. I joined Elder Parrish & we laboured to gether ^over 3 months^ and continued  *^and travelled & preached daily baptizing such as would receive our testimony on the 23rd of June^  ^we received a letter from Oliver Cowdery saying that they wished ^Elder^ Parrish to come to Kirtland & for me to remain^  ^to take charge of the Southern Churches & the Lord would bless me in so doing^  to extend our labourse through Tennessee & Kentucky, Elder Warren Parrish ordained  me to the office of an Elder. On the 28th day of June at Father Frys Eagle  Creek Benton County Tennessee  we baptized some 40 persons while labouring to gether  & on the 23rd of July ^1835^ I parted with Elder Parish also returned to Kirtland  This left me alone in my labours in the South. I continued to travel alone  through the year & extended my labours both in Kentucky & Tennessee I baptized   43 persons during this season 31 after Brother Parrish left me    On the 15 day of Nov while traveling about 12 miles in the night with severall  of the Brethren among whom was Brother Benjamin Clapp, a tremendous storm of wind   & rain over took us it was exceeding dark we bacame lost in a forest & we  crossed a dangerous stream some 20 times we had a creek to cross, the rain  ^stream^ had swollen to such an extent by the rain that we could not cross without 
 swimming our horses & several of the company were females & could not consistently  cross the stream he and we undertook to head the stream so that we could cross  sufficient to ford it, but in in the attemp in the midst of the darkness of the night  & the raging of the wind & rain we became lost in the thick woods we had neither fire,  light, or road, but was in the darkness, rain, wind, mud, creeks, & treetops we crossed   the stream near twenty times & setting aside our females & horses we made more the appearance  of fishermen than travelers. I thought of Paul's perils by water but the Lord was   merciful unto us in the midst of our troubles, for while we were gropeing with in   the darkness like the blind for the wall suffering under the pelt cold ^bursts^ & pelting ^hail^ floods  of wind & rain ^of the storms^ & runing the risk of killing both ourselves & animals by riding off   steep bluffs, a bright light suddenly shone around about us & revealed unto  us our perilous situation as were upon the edge of a deep gulf, the light continued   with us untill we found a house & got put upon ^learned^ the right road then the light   disappeared the darkness returned yet we were enabled to reach the house of Brother   Henry Thomas at 9 oclock in the evening, without any harm having rode 20 miles  being 5 hours in the storm, having forded creeks or [krakes] twenty or more  times but neither male or female murmured but ^and^ felt to thank God for our preservation  often    I received a letter from Oliver Cowdery at the time that  Warren   Parrish was called home. Councilling me to During the winter, ^&^ spring, & for part of the ^summer of 1836^  I continued to labour ^mostly alone^ through Kentucky & Tennessee extended my labours opening  new places preaching daily, baptizing, confirming, & organizing new branches  holding conferences &c At a conference held at Brother Clapp on Taropen  Calaway County, Kentucky, ^on the 26 day of Feb 1836^ I ordained A O. Smoot & Benjamin Boydston  Elders & Daniel Thomas & Benjamin Clapp to the office of a priest  Brothers Smoot & Clapp both entered into the labour of the ministry  Elder Smoot freequently accompanied me upon my mission  On the 21st day of April 1836 Elder David Patten returned to Tennessee   to again join me in my labours he Sister Patten came with him  I met with him on the 21st day of April 1836 in Henry County Tennessee  Tennessee it was truly a happy meeting. He related to me the blessings   which he had received in Kirtland during ther endowment which was   great & glorious & caused my heart to rejoice We travelled &   laboured together & preached daily, & continued to baptize such as would  receive our testimony persecution began to rage against us in the South Elder   Patten bore a very plain & pointed testimony unto the people of the work of God 
 in the last days & when we were opposed by a mob he would rebuke them in great  plainness we were not injured or molested ownly threatened, the sick were freequently  healed under our administration. On the 27th of May 1836 we were  again joined by Elder Warren Parrish direct from Kirtland Ohio who also  laboured with us. We held a conference on the 28th day of May at Brother Seth Utley ^in Benton County Tennessee^  where there was 7 Branches represented   containing 116 members Abel Wilson & Jesse Turpin were ordained priest  & Albert Petty a teacher. On the 31st day of May I was ordained under  the hands of David W Patten & Warren Parrish, Elder Patten being mouth unto  the office of the High Priesthood & a member of the 2nd Quorum of Seventies  [FIGURE] Elder Patten prophesied many blessings upon my head. We continued to   extend our labour upon a circuit of several hundred miles.  Elder A. O. Smoot also laboured constantly with us and Benjamin  L Clapp freequently—we would travel at times two by two then we would  all meet to gether ^to hold conferences &c^ at certain points we laboured dilligently & faithfully  administering in the ordinances of the gospel as we had an opportunity.  Persecution began to rage against us in Benton County Tennessee and   on the 19th June a ^states^ warrant was issued against David Patten Warren W   Parrish & Wilford Woodruff sworn out by Mathew Williams at Methodist  priest served by the shiriff Robert C Petty Elders Patten & Parrish   were taken by an armed mob of about 50 under form of law led by   the sheriff a colonel 1st & 2nd Major with other Officers & a   Methodist priest with a gun upon his shoulder, I was in another   county & not taken we were accused of prophesying falsely by   saying that 4 persons who were baptized should received the Holy Ghost   in 24 hours & that Christ would come in this generation. The second   time before this generation passed away. The whole concern was a ^mob^ mock trial  contrary to law, justice judgment, mercy or truth. The particulars of which  were recorded in D. W. Pattens account. On the 25 ^June^ I preached in the   Court House in Dresden Weebly County Tennessee to a crowded house was  followed by Brother A O Smoot & Benjamin Clapp. On the 27 I  went to a Baptist meeting house on Thompsons Creek to fulfill a previous  appointment when I arrived the house was crowded with people I entered the   pulpit & was asked to speak when the Baptist priest Mr Browning arrived   on horseback at the door directly steped inside the door in great  agitation & told the Deacons to forbid my preaching in the house 
 at the same time began to talk about the mormons & told several  lies which I corrected before the people, this still enraged him worse  and I was forbidden to preach in the house I told the people  as I had been invited to preach to them & had come 10 miles  to fulfill the appointment I would like to preach to them, I was willing   to stand on a fence, wood pile, on a cart or anyplace they would   appoint a man rose & said he owned the land in front of the meeting  house I might stand upon that & preach & welcome all the congregation  except the Minister & one Deacon left the house walked across the street  formed seats out of a worm fence & gave good attention while I   preached for an hour & a half upon the first principles of the   Gospel when I closed I gave liberty for anyone to speak that wished  Mr Randolpph Allexander arose & made a few remarks it being the  first time he had a Mormon Elder speak, "He said the people at the present  day made him think of a pen of hogs the keeper would make a trought &  pour into it any thing & they would drink it, hot or cold water, dish water  or anything els, but let a stranger come along & pour over a bucket   of corn on the back side of the pen & the hogs would be frightened & run &  snort all over the pen. He said it was so with the people their priest will  feed the people with ^them on^ any kind of food or doctrine no matter how fals the people   will drink it down but let a stranger come & preach the truth as Mr  gospel of Jesus Christ which will save the people as Mr Woodruff has   done & the people are afraid of him." Mr Allexander invited me home  bought a Book of Mormon of me, & was soon baptized and ^as was^ several   others were soon baptized in that place. July 14 th I wrote a letter   to president Oliver Cowdery at Kirtland Ohio & sent him a list of   subscribers for the Messenger & Advocate and gave him an account of  my Mission in the South. 18th I rode in company with Brother A  O Smoot to a ferry on the Tennessee River their was no ferryman to  cross us over, we were offered the use of the ferry boat, so we let our  own horses unto it & concluded to row ourselves acrosst ^we ferried ourselves^ but not being   much used to the business and loosing one oar in the river having to row   with one broaken oar we landed a great distance below the usual place  of landing with a high circulation of blood & blistered hands but   our horses leaped the bank & we went on our journey to the Sandy  & swam our horses across the streamwent to Mr Thomas Fraziers & spent the   night. July 30th We rode to Mr David Criders and preached at 
 His house also on Sunday the 31st we were threatened with a mob we  I baptized Mr Crider amid the scoffs & jeers of the rablle  they did not mob us but went in the night & poisoned both  of our horses the one which I rode belonging to Brother Samuel   West died in [t◊◊◊◊] two days afterwards Brother Smoots recovered  the hogs that eat of the horse flesh also died. August 11th I rode to  Mr Gainers in Henry county Tennessee ^with Brother Smoot^ where we had the priviledge of again   met with Brother David W Patten & his wife, Brother Patten  and Parrish had been driven from place to place by a mob because   of their religions they were driven out of Benton County into Henry County  Elder Parrish had left for Kirtland. I headed ^laboured^ with Brother Patten  & Smoot and preached daily through the County untill the 29th when  we were visited by Elders Thomas B Marsh & Elisha H Groves  who had come direct from Caldwell County Missouri, we had a  pleasing interview. On the 2nd of Sept we held a conference  at Damonds Creek Calaway County KY. There were present T. B. Marsh  D W Patten ^of the Twelve Apostles and Elders^ E. H. Groves, W. Woodruff A. O. Smoot D. Cathcart  & other official Members. President Marsh presided. R Allexander Clerk  the various branches were represented containing 119 members in  good standing Johnston F Lane Benjamin L Clapp & Randolph Allexander  were ordained Elders under the by David W Patten & Linzy Braid to the  office of a priest 5 were baptized at the close of the conference by Elder  Patten. At the conference I was dismissed from my labours in   the South by Elders Marsh & Patten and councilled to go to   Kirtlind & get my Endowment, as was also Elder ^A O^ Smoot,  we however again visited the south th[r]ough most of the our field  of Labor before leaving and baptized several persons among the number  was Parson Baity a preacher of the Denomination called Christians  On the 19th Sept at the house of Brother Camps in Kentucky I took the parting  hand with Brother ^T. B^ Marsh D. W. Patten & wife & E. H. Groves who started in   a two hors waggon for Far West Mo. The same day they left I orgin-  ized the first company of Saints who ^that^ ever emigrated from the  Southern States for Zion which consisted of Lewis & Benjamin Clapp  & families Albert Petty & John Camp and their families and Elders  Boydston & Cathcart numbering 22 souls I travelled with them the first  day ^8 miles^ to the South fork of Mayfield where we pit[c]hed our tents for the night 
 I gathered this small camp together in Brother Albert Petty tent and   we appointed Elder ^Benjamin^ Boydston as their leaded to Colwell County Mo. I then  addressed ^taught them^ upon the subject of their journey the importance of their being united,  following the council of their leader, remembering their prayers night &   morning, before the Lord. I was followed by Elders Boydston Clapp &   Cathcart and the rain poured down in torents during the whole time  untill we were thoroughly wet in a good tent    On the morning of the 20 Sept 1836 I parted with this ^the^ camp who  started upon their journey for Zion. I then spent a few days with  Elder A. O. Smoot in visiting several of the branches we travelled 224 miles  and baptized & & confirmed 8 persons and obtained 30 subscribers for  the Messenger & Advocate.

He was the first to circulate it I herd President Joseph Smith declare  in the presence of F. G. Williams D Whitmer E Smith W Parrish & others that he  had received that morning the word of the Lord upon the subject of the Kirtland Safety  Society.

Joseph blessed the people in the  name of the Lord and said if we would be faithful we should arise above our embaris-  ments and be delivered from the hands of our enemies.    (30. I wrote an peace ^article^ which was published in the Messenger & Advocate)    Jan 31: An address was delivered in the Temple upon the temporal interest of the  Church of Christ by President Joseph Smith, and Sidney Rigdon. A petioton  was prepared to present to the Legislature of Ohio asking for a charter to support  the Kirtland Safety Society.    Feb 19th Sunday I attended the meeting at the Temple ^president^ Joseph ^Smith^ had been absent on  business for the Church but not half as long as Moses was in the mount away from   Israel yet many of the people in Kirtland if they did not make a calf to worship  as did the Israelites, they turned their hearts away from the Lord and from Joseph  they had engaged in speculation and given away to fals spririts untill they were dark-  ened in their minds and many were opposed to Joseph ^Smith^ and some wished to appoint  David Whitmore as prophet ^a^ to lead the Church in ^his^ stead of Joseph it was in the midst  of this cloud of dark spirits that Joseph returned to Kirtland and this morning arose  in the stand. when he first arose in the he appeared as though he was much  depressed in spirit but soon the spirit of God rested upon him and he addressed the   Assembly in great plainness for about three hours and he put his enemies to silence  for the time being when he arose he said I am still the ^President^ prophet, seer, and revelator  and leader of the Church of Jesus Christ and kingdom of God upon the Earth.  God and not man has appointed and placed me in this position and No man  or set of men has ^have^ power to remove me or appoint another in my stead and those 
 that undertake it if they do not spedily repent they will go to hell and burn  their fingers. He reproved the people sharply for their sins darkness and unbelief  the power of God rested upon him and bore testimony that what he said ^his sayings^ was true.  His discourse was not reported and here cannot be given. He also addressed the  people again on Sunday the 26th March 24th I left my school to make some  preparations for my Endowment March 23rd This day was spent in the Temple by the  saints in Kirtland in fasting and prayer the House was divided into four parts  by vails the females the females occupied 2 apartments and the males the other two.  The Patirarch Joseph Smith sen ^Presided He^ called upon me to read a Chapter in the Book of  Mormon. I read the third Chapter of the Book of Jacob containing the parable of  the bare Olive tree likend unto the House of Israel, I made a few remarks upon  the subject, the time was occupied during the day in singing, exhortation, prayer and  the exercising of the gifts, some spoke in tongues, others interpeted. The Spirit of the Lord  was poured out upon the people in a great degree, at the close of the meeting there was a  ^a^ contribution ^was^ taken up for the poor. 26 Sunday in the forenoon the sacrament was  administered to the Saints, in the afternoon Elder W Parrish preached the foward  Sermon of the wife of Elder Parley P.

April 4th I received my washings and anointings in the House of the Lord in Kirtland  I spent the whole night in the Temple with others of the seventies in prayer and fasting  the spirit of the Lord rested upon us. After praying and fasting for 24 hours I went  home and partook of food. On the 6th day of April 1837 The presidency  of the Church, the Twelve Apostles, High priests, Seventies, with the ^and^ other Quorums of  the Church- met in solmum assembly to transact the business of the Church  after spending an hour in the lower part of the House, the presidency called the  Seventies into an upper room. And there removed six of the presidency of the  seventies into the High Priest Quorum, then appointed six others to take their  place as Presidents of the Seventies. Then the presidency of the Church ^and^ sealed  upon our heads, our washings, anointings, & blessings with a loud shout of Hosanna  to God & the Lamb. The spirit and power of God rested upon ^us^ to the joy of our hearts  after spending three hours in the upper rooms we then joined the congregation of the  Saints in ^The Quorums then repaired to^ the Lower Court and each the vails were closed ^lowered^ and each appartment  attended to the duties of their office. The ^the Ordinance of washing of feet was administered^ washing of the feet of the anointed was  the next business attended to, The Twelve assisted the presidency of the Seventies to wash  the feet of the Elders Elder ^H. C.^ Kimball washed my feet and pronounced blessings upon me  my head. when at the close of ^after^ this ordinance the veils ^of the Temple^ were rolled up which  brought the whole assembly congregation into one assembly. The Presidency occupied  the lower stand of the priesthood. And ^and^ President Joseph Smith arose and addressed  the Saints ^Elders^ for the term of three hours clothed with the spirit and power of God 
 He unbosomed his feelings in the House of his friends gave much important instruction   to the Elders which was not reported he urged upon us ^the absolute necessity of giving strict heed to obey^ to give heed to his teachings and  councils ^and the revelations of the Lord to the Church^ and be wise in all things that Zion and her stakes might be redeemed and  esstablished ^no more to be thrown down^ in esstablished. He said that the Kings of the Earth would yet come to  behold the glory of Zion and great and glorios blessings would be bestowed upon the  Saints in the last days. Hiram Smith followed Joseph and bore testimony to the truth  of what he had said. He ^&^ was followed by Oliver Cowdery who made but few   remarks He exhorted the Saints ^Elders^ to keep within the bounds of their knowledge  and let the great mysteries of the kingdom alone, for the gentiles had not a knowledge  even of the first principles of the gospel, for it is far better to preach what the people  would call the small things of the Kingdom than to enter into the visions of  Isaiah, Ezekiel, and John. He was followed by Elder Sidney Rigdon with  a few remarks. Then the Twelve were called upon to break bread ^which was distributed to the^ to the multi-  tude, (as Jesus did in the days of the Apostles ^who eat and were filled^) And the multitude eat and were filled  and rejoiced together at the closed of the feast thanks was returned to the  Lord for his blessings with uplifted hands to heaven which was at the ^Thanks was returned at the meeting closed at the^   setting of the sun. But The House was again filled at candle light  and the meeting again commenced with much interest. The prophet Joseph  ^President Smith^ requested the congregation ^Elders^ to speak their feelings freely and sing exhort or  pray as the spirit should give utterance. The meeting continued during the  whole night many of the gifts were poured out upon the people. and at break  of day the meeting was ^we were^ dismissed and we returned to our homes  I also spent the night of the 7th in the Temple with several of the  Elders in prayer and praise before the Lord the Holy Ghost rested upon  us and the spirit of prophesy was given unto ^us^ and many things were  shown us by the Holy Spirit. April 9th Sunday The patriarch Joseph  Smith opened the meeting in the morning by prayer and read the twelvth  Chapter of the 2 second Book of Nephi and preached from it during the forenoon  in the afternoon Elders Kimball, O Pratt, and S. Rigdon, spoke followed by the  Prophet Joseph ^April 9th president Smith spoke in the afternoon^ He & said in the name of the Lord that the judgments of God would  rest upon those men who had professed to be his friends and friends to humanity  and the ^in^ building up Kirtland the ^a^ stake of Zion, but had turned traitors to him and  to interest of the Kingdom of God had given power into hands of our enemies  against us, and they had oppressed the poor Saints, and had become covenant   breakers for which they will feel the wrath of God, he said they had become  whited walls and sought to bring distress upon the Saints    April 13th 1837 I married Phebe W Carter daughter of Ezra & Sarah  Carter of Scarborough Maine I was married at the house of President Joseph Smith 
 the marriage carrimony was performed by Frederick G Williams ^Esqr^ and we were  blessed by the Patriarch Joseph Smith sen The Prophet Joseph was expecting to  marry us but his life was sought by a mob and he had to flee from his house  and hide himself us his house was guarded day and night by his brethren  Elder Johnathan Homes was married at the same time to Mariet Carter daughter  of John S Carter On the 15 of April I received my Patriarchel Blessings  under the hands of the Patriarch Joseph Smith sen. My wife ^having^ received her patriarchal  blessings ^from him^ under the hands of the Patriarch Joseph Smith, sen Nov 10 1836.  On the 5th May while labouring for Joseph Young we were visited with a  sudden storm of wind and rain a vain of it past south of the Temple in the  form of a whirlwind or tornado which destroyed and injured several buildings  it crushed one of Elders Youngs buildings and removed the one we were in ^some 10 feet^ but no  person was injured soon all was calm again. On Sunday May 28 Joseph Smith  addressed the people in the Temple upon the subject of the apostacy in the Church in Kirtland  the spirit of murmuring complaining, and aposticy had increased throughout Kirtland  untill it was almost difficult to tell who was Joseph friends and who were not  this spirit had been incresed in the family circle in secret chambers, and in the streets  untill many ^had apostitized^ were apostitizing not both in high places and through the whol body  of the Church and many were taking strong grounds against Joseph they were  trying to cast him down and destroy his influence. This grieved Joseph to the  heart to have to pass through such perils among fals brethren. But notwithstanding  this thick cloud of darkness which hung over Kirtland Joseph ^He^ remained unmoved  in the cause of God and was determined to magnify his calling and leave the evil  in the hand of God. At this time the number of his friends that occupied high station  in the Church that had faith and moral courage to stand by him shoulder to shoulder   were vary few among the number was Brigham Young who stood by him in evry   trial he was also sustained by Heber C Kimball Sidney Rigdon and a few others  it was in the midst of this scene of things that Joseph entered the stand  congregation and arose in the stand and spoke to the people in the name of the Lord in his  own defence the Lord was with him by his power and spirit to the convincing of the   honest in heart that he would stand while his enemies would fall. Sidney  Rigdon followed him as he did several others and sustained him in his position  Warren Parrish spoke against him in the bitterness of his heart as had some of the  twelve before, but the people could discern the difference of the spirit between Joseph and  his enemies. But Joseph came off triumphant in all of his difficulties and accusations  that came from fals brethren or his persecution from the world    While in the mist of this scene of things in Kirtland I felt impressed to go out upon  a mission the spirit that was upon me lead me to go to Fox Islands called 
 Vinal Haven bordering East upon the State of Maine although it was a country  I never had visited. I named my feelings upon the subject to Elder Kimball Sidney  Rigdon, and some others they incoraged me to go, Elder Kimball blessed me and said  in the name of the Lord I should be blessed and prospered on my mission & do a good  work I made a proposition to Elder Johnathan H.

At the^  at the door the meeting had begun, I sent for the Deacon who came to the doors  I told him I wished him to inform the minister that there was two servants ^we were servants^   of God at the door who ^and^ wished to deliver a message to that people. He sent word  for us to come into the pulpit accordingly with valiece in hand we walked  up into the pulpit and took a seat one on each side of him, when  he closed his discourse he asked me what hour we would like to speak  to the people I told him at 5 oclock he gave out our appointment and  invited us to his house to take tea we accepted the invitation on arriving at   his house I asked how many school houses there was on the Island he  said four ^4^ ^four^ and gave me their names ranging from West to East I asked him

He finally resolved to  reject it and took a stand against us. He commenced preaching against us  also sent for Mr Douglass the Methodist Minister on the South Island to come over  and help him he had been long at variance with Mr Douglas but they now made  friends and united in a war against us but they did not stop the work of God  we continued preaching daily untill we baptized most of the members of Mr  Newtons, Church, and those who owned the meeting house. I then followed  Mr Douglass home to his own Island and commenced preaching to his  Church and baptized a good share of his members ^A number of those that we baptized were^ they also sent for other  ^sea Captains,^ Ministers from the Main Land who came over and tryed to put a stop to the work  by preaching and lying about us but the work continued to roll on they wished  me to work a miracle to convince them that my Doctrine was true, I told them  they had rejected the truth and they would see signs but not unto Salvation

I laboured mostly upon those Islands during  ^I labored here during^ the winter of 1837 & 8, and as nearly evry person oupon those Islands had over 10 years  old had attended my meetings and investigated the principles of mormonism the people  began to ^and^ take sides either for or against, ^us^ and our enemies would gather together at  times to try ^made attempts^ to break up our meetings, while holding a meeting on the North  Island. On the evening of the 15 Jan 1838 a company of sailors belonging to the  United States Revenue Cutter whose business it was while coasting to protect the  Lives and Liberties of all American citizens as far as they could they hauled  on shore a panel of cannon ^Brought on shore^ a swivel and joined the mob and paraded near  the house where I was speaking ^preaching^ and discharged it several times followed by smaller  arms with the intention of breaking up our meeting, but it ownly caused me to   preach the longer and louder as some of the mob gathered around to see what effect  it would have I warned them in the name of the Lord, and proclaimed the judgments  of God that awaited the wicked and I shook my garments in the presence of the people  and told them I was clear of their blood and ^but^ they heard my voice and words  ownly when mingle with the roar of Cannon and musketry, before I had done  speaking they went back on board of the Revenue Cutter taking their arms with ^them^  having accomplished nothing ownly showing the wickedness of their hearts, and burning  up some powder and grass. at the close of the meeting I baptized 2, also one next  day and while baptizing the mob again commencing^d^ fireing guns but being loaded with 
 nothing but powder they were harmless. The Baptist and Methodist joined  the mob, ^originated got up^ and tried to stir up the people and lied about us more than proved for their  benefit.  Mr Douglass the methodist priest on the South Island ^when argument found him^ applyed to the   ^to all the^ magistrates for a warrants against me for a lie bill for overthrowing his doctrin but ^they refused to grant them as he had no^   their was not a magistrate on the Islands would issue one to him.  ^cause of complaint but religious persecution^    On the 13th Feb 1838 I left the Islands I crossed in the mail boat to Hampden on  the main Land. I there met with ^ordained^ James Townsend I set him apart to the ministry  and we walked together through deep snows to the City of Bangor, preaching each  night and visited and preached in the Town of searsmont, Belfast, Northport  Frankfort Hampden, and twice in the City Hall in Bangor, to large assemblies, and  returned to the ^Fox^ Islands via Casteme and the Isle of Holt, arived in Vinal Haven the  8th March ^Elder Townsend returned home^. On the 22nd March I accompanied Brother Starreat at low tide onto a  barr to some 40 rods from shore to dig som clams, we were soon accompanied by Mrs  Woodruff and a Sister Stone who had a curiosity to see how clams were dug, the ground  for some 12 rods near shore was several feet lower than the point we were on we were  so busily ingaged in diging clams we did not observe the flowing tide untill we  were surrounded with water, and having no boat we had no other alternative  ownly to waid ashore and carry the women to dry land in an arm chair, which we  safely accomplished amid the reflection that the tide nor more than time waited for no  man,. On the 4th April I called at the post office and Mr Kent the post master  showed me a letter containing two sheets of fools cap signed by Warren Parrish  and several of the Twelve who had apostitized and been cut off from the Church the  letter was teeming with falshood against Joseph Smith and the Prophet and all that stood  by him it was sent with the intention to of breaking up the work upon these   Islands but it did not injure have the do accomplish it or hinder the work.    On the 11th April I was visited by Elder Townsend and Milton Holmes who  attended the conference with me upon both Islands and bore their testimony to the  people, but the spirit of opposition increased to a great hights, untill I felt warned  by the spirit to leave the Island for a season and take a western mission. after visiting  the saints from house to house, and praying with them and incouraging them I left  them on the 28th April and went to the main land with Elder Holmes & Townsend Mrs   Woodruff ^Mrs Woodruff^ had returned to her friends in Scar Fathers house on the 17th April We walked  to Scarborough, I left Scarborough May 7th walked to Bradford where I left  Elder Holmes, I walked to Boston and on the 11th I had an appointment to   preached at Sister Vose room. But I went to Cambridgeport to visit Elder A. P. Rockwood  who had been shut up in jail on pretense of debt but in reality out of persecution the  jailer shut ^locked^ me in and did not let me out till 10 oclock at night but while it 
 disappointed a congregation of people it gave me a happy visit with Elder Rockwood  in conversing upon the work of God if we were ^although^ in Jail, it was the first time I had ever  met with him. On my return to Boston the people were still waiting to hear  me speak though at a late hour, I spoke to them a short time. On the 14 I left   Boston and walked some 30 miles to Hollistown to Deacon Havens and preached, I walked to   Providence RI, took steamer to New York arived on the 18 Met with Br Orson  Pratt and attended meetings with him ^un^till the 27. When I went up the North River  and preached at ^to^ New Burgh and preached in several towns in New York and New  Jersey and walked around the country to Farmington Connecticut and arived at my  Fathers house on the 11th June 1838 I commenced preaching at my Fathers house  to such as would come together to hear. Ond On the first day of July I baptized  six persons in Farmington river including my Father, step Mother, and ^my ownly^ sister Unis  Eunice, also cousin Seth Woodruff and aunt Anna Cossett, and Dwight Webster  a Methodist class Leader who was boarding at my Fathers house. When Father J  the Patriarch Joseph Smith sen gave me my blessing he said I should bring  my Fathers household into the Kingdom of God, I felt that it had been fulfilled this  day. I confirmed those baptized and organized this small branch of the Church  consisting of 9 members 8 of which were relatives, I ordained Dwight Webster  to the office of a Priest and administered the sacrament unto them. On the 3rd of July  after committing myself father Aphek Woodruff and his household into the hands of God  I bid them farewell and again ^I^ started for the state of Maine. I walked most of the  way to Boston there took steemer for Portland and arived at Father Carters ^In Scarboro^ on the 6th  On the 14th July My wife was delivered of a daughter wh at her Fathers house which  we named Sarah Emma. On July 22 I wrote a letter to Thomas B Marsh  giving him an account of my labours upon Fox Islands and the Eastern Country  On the 30th I left Scarborough and returned to the Islands I preached several times  to large congregations in Thomaston & the methodist meeting house in East Thomaston  and in the Town Hall in Camden before crossing to the Islands where I arived on the   7th Aug.  On the 9 Aug I received a letter from Thomas B Marsh informing me  of my appointment to fill the place in the Quorum of the Twelve of one who had fallen  and I was requested to come to Far West as soon as possible to prepare for a mission  to England in the spring. I immediately visited all the Saints upon both Islands  and earnestly exhorted them to sell their property and prepare themselves to accompany  me to the body of the Church in Missouri. Several immediately sold their property  but many were poor and had not the means to. Brother Nathaniel Thomas said   he would furnish means to help off all the poor saints upon Fox Islands who wished  to go, and for this purposes went with me to the main land ^on the 13th Aug^ and I assisted him 
 in procuring about two thousand d ollars worth of horses, waggons, tents &c for the   company. He paid about $1,500 of the expens himself $1,000 of which was to furnish  conveyance for the poor after purchasing the outfit for the company and urging the importance  of their starting as soon as possible not later than the first of Sept. On the 19th Aug  I left thesaints ^upon the Islands^ returned to town of Camden where we had prepared our outfit and returned  to Scarborough to prepare my own family for the journey, expecting to see the company in  few days but here I remained in great suspens untill the 1st Oct when Elder Townsend  went to meet the company. They arived in Scarborough on the 3rd Oct with their  waggon covers all flying. The company stoped at the house of Sister Sarah B Foss  we went to work nailed down all the covers and painted them and made them water  proof. And in the after noon of the 4th Oct 1838 ^with^ my wife bid her Father Mother &  friends fare well ^and with her child two month and a half old in the first stage of the hooping cough^ and we [FIGURE] started upon our journey. The company consisted of  53 persons including Brother Townsend & family and myself and family we had 10 waggons  a pair of horses to each waggon, we had now ^before us at this late period^ commenced this gloo 4th day of Oct  ^Before us^ to start upon a gloomy land journey of two thousand miles from Maine to Missouri  we continued to travel from day to day to day through all the rain, mud, cold, frost, and  snow, untill I arived in Rochester, Sangamont Co Illinos, on the 19th day of Dec.  where I stoped and setled my family and company for the winter. My wife had  passed through a severe course of the brain fever and her s while upon the journey  and her sufferings had been very great her spirit had left her body twice to all  human appearance and ownly been called back through the prayer of faith and the power of  God. Our child had also been very sick and I had become so thoroughly chilled through   my whole system ^in crossing the bleak prairies^ ^*Brother Thomas had buried one child and^ that it was two months after I stoped before I got sufficiently thawed  nearly all the company had been sick through their exposures some of them had stoped by the way  out and warmed up to feel natural. ** We continued travelling untill we were obliged to  side we had wallowed through much mud and snow had broaken several axeltrees, and  stop in consequence of the bad roads and cold weather, I spent the remainder of  ^we suffered much upon the journey yet &^  the winter laboring with my ^hands^ for the support of my family. On the 8th day of March  1839 I attended a conference at Springfield Ill. their was present 8 seventies  6 Elders 3 priest and 1 Deacon, several were presented on ordination, we ordained  2 Elders & one priest. Brother Brewster was presented for ordination and Brother  Dunham strongly urged that he be ordained as did several others. I strongly objected to it  for I felt that the spirit the man possessed was not of God, a strong influence was  got up in his favor in Springfield, I called a vote of the Elders upon the subject and  all voted for him to be ordained except 3 of us two besides myself he then  came foreward d and demanded baptism ^ordination^ at my hands ^in the name of Jesus Christ^ I told him he should  not be ordained by my consent, for that was not the way God imparted the Holy  priesthood to the children of man he was not ordained and I marvelled that so  many should have voted for his ordination after seeing the spirit he manifested 
 March 13 I was pressed in spirit to go to Quincy Illinois and visit the  the saints who had fled their from their persecuters in Missouri I immediately  ^March 13^  I took my wife ^Family^ & child into my waggon and started on the 12th March and arived  ^March 13 I took my family and started for Quincy where I arived^   in Quincy on the 16. I dined with Emma Smith at Judge Clevelands I then  went on the bank of the river near Quincy and saw ^a great^ many of the Saints  old and young man wom & children lying in the mud and water in a hard rain  storm with^out^ scarcely any tent or covering which ^suffering^ was the fruits ^caused by^ of the unhallowed  persecution of the State of Missouri the sight filled my eyes with tears  while my heart was made glad at the cheerfulness of the Saints in the  midst of ther ^affliction^ dreary position. Sunday 17. I had an interview with Elder  ^President^ Brigham Young and John Taylor we held a meeting with the saints $50 and a number  of teams was raised to bring out the remainder of the people from Missouri. I made a statement  of the procedings of the Springfield Conference when the Church voted that Jonathan Dunham  be reproved for calling a conference at Springfield and for cherishing the wrong spirit  which Brewster possessed.  President Brigham Young councilled that the Twelve as soon  as possible immediately move their families to ^to locate their families in^ Quincy ^for the time being^ so they could be together in council  I left Quincy on the 20th arived in Springfield on the 23rd Held a meeting with the Saints  reproved Elder Dunham for his course in maintaining Brewster in his wrong spirit. He  confessed asked forgiveness & was forgiven I collected a donation of ^I returned to Rochester for my effects while at Springfield I collected $70 for the relief of the  Saints in Quincy ^which I sent to them^ A messenger took it to the Brethren in that place. I arived in Rochester  on the 24th. On April 3rd while riding upon the running gears of a waggon, setting upon the  foreward bolster, the bolt came out of the copling pole which left the hind wheels I was imme-  diately shot up between the bolster and tongue with the coupling pole turned over upon the horses backs  the horses became frightened and ran onto an open prairie with me draging my head and  shoulders upon the ground after draging me in this position for several minutes I managed  to dr guide them so as to run into the corner of a high staked worm fence where I  landed with myself ^&^ horses in a pile, and escaped through the mercy of God with ownly a few  bruises without any broken bones. I settled my business and ^I^ returned to Quincy on the  8 April where I left my family and went to Far west with the Twelve and  attended the conference on the Temple Block on the 26 April 1839 where I was ordained  as one of the Twelve Apostles on the corner stone of the Temple under the hands of the Twelve  ^Elder^ Brigham Young being mouth. Elder G. A. Smith was also ordained ^at the same time^ to the same office. We  returned to Quincy on the 2nd day of May. On the 3rd in company with five of the  Twelve I went to Mr Cleevelands and had a happy interviewed with ^President^ Joseph Smith the  Prophet who had just escaped out of the hands of his persecuters in Missouri it was the 
 first time I had seen him for more than two years it was a happy meeting I attended   the conferences and meetings with the saints in Quincy untill the 15th when I left with  Elder Brigham Young and journeyed to Nau M Commerce with him crossed the river and settled  my family in a room in the old barracks in Montrose Brother Brigham Young and family occupied ^I moved my family to Montrose and occupied a room in the barracks^  ^with President Young and family^ the same room with me a short time I spent my time attending the meetings, council, and   conferences in I wrote ^in my journal^ the teaching of Joseph sayings, and prophesyings of Joseph from  time to time as I had an opportunity. July 22 I was with the prophet ^President^ Joseph ^Smith^ and his   council and the Twelve, it was a day of Gods power with the prophet, he healed many on both  sides of the river who were sick nigh unto death, among ^them^ was Elijah Fordham and   Joseph B. Nobles, as the Prophet had healed many even the wicked rabble followed  to see the sick healed and as Joseph was about to cross the river a man came to  him and asked him if he would not go about 3 miles and healed two of his small  children which were twins about 3 months old and were sick nigh unto death, he was a  man of the world never herd a sermon preached by a Latter Day Saint, Joseph said   he could not go, but he would send a man, after a moments hesitation he turned  to me and said you go with this man and heal his children, at the same time giving  me a read po sick [silk] handkerchief and said after you lay hands upon them wipe their faces  with it and they shall be healed, and as long as you will keep that handkerchief it shall  ever remain as a league between you and me, I went and done as I was commanded  and the children were healed. On the 25 I was attacked with the chills and fever for the  first time in my life. I had a chill every other day and was very sick. On the 8th of  I laid hands upon my wife and children blessed then committed them into the hands of God  and started upon my English mission ^leaving my family sick and with not more than 4 days provision^ Brother Brigham Young rowed me across the river in a   boat, I was sick and feeble, when I landed I laid down upon the bank of the river on a   side of soal leather, the prophet Joseph came along and looked at me and said you are starting  on your mission, I said yes, but I look like a poor instrument for a missionary I look  more fit for the hospital or desecting room, ^than a missionary^ he replyed what do you say that for, go ahead in   the name of the Lord and you shall be healed and blessed on your mission I thanked him  A brother came along with a waggon I got and took me to carried me along a few miles  on my road, I started without purse or scrip I passed by Parley ^P^ Pratt who was hewing  house logs for a house barefoot, bareheaded, without coat or jaket on, he came to me and said I have  no money but I have got an empty purse. I will give you that. I went a few rods and found  Elder H. C. Kimball in nearly the same position, that Parley was, building a log cabin also he crossed  to me and ^said^ I have one dollar I will give you that to put in your purse. He blessed me and I   went along my way accompanied by Elder John Taylor I had a shake of the ague every other  day and lay on the bottom of the waggon while I travelled over the ^a^ stubs and stones  we stoped with Samuel and Carlos Smith at McComb held a meeting with the Saints

We sold our horse in Springfield, and left on the 21st continued  our journey we spent the night of the 24 with Dr Modasett, at Terrehaute. On the 28th  while travelling Elder Taylor had a suddent attack fell to the ground as though he had been  knocked down we administered to him and he revived, on the following day he fell again  and fainted several times, it seemed as though the Destroyer would take his life, we  travelled with him 4 days after he was taken sick, ^his sickness proved to be^ it was then evident that he had a hard  attacked of the billious fever we stoped with him ^two^ at a Jerman Tavern in Germantown Wane  County Indianna with a k kind family with whom he was acquainted, we stoped with  him two days, untill Father Coulton would stop no longer, I offered ^proposed^ to remain with   Brother Taylor but as I was sick with the fever and ague and not able to take care of   myself Brother Taylor he ^Brother Taylor^ advised ^me^ to continue my journey, with Father, Coultrin^ ^saying it was easier to take care of one sick man than two^ saying  that one such man could get along better than two, according to his council I committed  him into the hands of God and the family promised to do all in their power to make him comfortable  I parted with him with a heavy heart, on the 2nd Sept and continued my journey with  Father Coultrin to Cleaveland Ohio, I there took steamer on the 10th for Buffalo but we  had a severe gale and did not reach Buffalo untill the 12thth I travelled to Albany on a   canal boat had the ague daily, was very sick, had no companion except sectarian   priest who was daily lying about ^the mormons^ mormonism I took stage ^at Albany^ for Farmington  Ct on the night of the 19th and rode all night and the following day and suffering  immensely ^severely^ with the fever and ague I arived at my Fathers house in Farmington Ct  on the 21st Sept Quite sick I found my Father and family well.

As soon as I delivered the paper to the office I went home and went to bed  and ^I was confined to my bed for forty days unabled to get up^ ^and^ passed through the most severe fit of sickness I ever endured in my life, my life  was dispaired of by many. I lay 40 days upon my bed unabled to set up at all I was adm-  inistered to by the Twelve, and others and my life preserved through the power of God I  took a relaps twice after I began to recover. Once was while in council with the presidency  and Twelve. my strength left me my breath stoped and I felt as though I was struck with  death it was with great difficulty that I was brought to by the laying on of hands. after  my recovery I continued my labours in the printing office. ^Sept 24^ The office took fire  in the upper story in the midst of a large amount of paper and it came near burning ^up^  it to the ground.

Grant & Ezra Thayer we travelled through Ill  ^Ia^ and Michigan^ and preached and held Conferences^ June 17 I parted with Elder G A Smith in Franklin Oakland co  Michigan and went to Boston via the Lakes and Albany met with the Twelve in Boston  on the 27th June I attended Conferences and meetings with the Twelve and visited  Maine I was in portland ready to step on board of a steamer for fox Islands when  I saw an accout of the death ^marterdom^ of Joseph & Hiram Smith in Carthage Jail the spirit  bore record to me it was true, I immediately returned to Boston met in Council  with the Twelve. returned with them to Nauvoo where we arived on the 6th Aug I  attended the Special Conference of the Authorities of the Church where the thousands who  assembled on the occasion voted unanimously to sustain the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles  as the Presidency and Leaders of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints  I have ever been impressed sinch since my first acquaintance with the Church  and Kingdom of God upon the Earth with the deep importance of keeping a journal  and record of the dealings of God with this people and our official acts in the  Ministry, and under this view I have written ^sketches of^ most of the sermons and teaching which   I have ever had from the mouth of Joseph Smith the Prophet and many of the teachings  of the Twelve Apostles and others believing this course to be beneficial to us as well  as the Saints in former generations I would recomend the Elders of Israel to do  likewise that what is recorded on Earth may be recorded in Heaven 
 * paper apart page 5, 11th line    History of Wilford Woodruff    On the 29thday of March ^21st^1856    On the 21st day of April 1856 I innoculated my arm with poison & mortifycation  while assisting to remove an ox which had died of poison & beened been skined which  poison worked through my system for seven days before it showed itself outwardly  on the 28th day my arm began to swell was in great pain and showed signs of mortification  I showed it to President Young who advised me to clens my stomach immediately  and put on onion poltices and any thing that would draw the poison from  my system into my arm which council I immediately put into execution  29th was another trying day to my life the poison had so thoroughly penetrated  my whole system that my strength left me I could not stand I was led to my  bed my bowels and stomach sceased to act, my speech was like that of a drunken  man President Young called in company with Dr Sprague and laid hands  upon me and rebuked the deseace & the power of the Destroyer which had seized  my body and promised me in the name of the Lord that I should not die but  live to finish my work which was appointed me upon the Earth, I soon began  to recover, the poison ^and mortification^ left my system and centered in my arm which was removed  drawn from my arm through the aid of charcoal poltices mostened with ^a^ strong  decotion of wormwood rag weed & wild sage, the dead flesh was removed from my  arm with instruments and Lunar Castic and in few days I was well again    (*paper apart page 5th) 11th line) During the winter of 1831 while in  New Hartford Ct I passed through a severe course of the lung fever    (*paper apart Page 6th to come in its date,) taken off from page 38.)  On the 23rd of July 1842 President Joseph Smith sent me from  Nauvoo to St Louis to procure a stock of paper. I started went down upon  a steamer to steemboat was 6 days on the way during which time I  was severely attak with the Billious fever on the day I made my  purchase the fever was so high I was sccarcely sensible of what I was  doing as soon as I had made my purchase & got my freight on  board I took my birth and lay there untill I arived in Nauvoo  which was on the 10th Aug I was confined to my bed 40 days  and passed through the most sever[e] fit of sickness I ever endured  my life was dispaired of by many 
 (*2nd, Page 6th paper apart)    On the 5 day of Oct 1846 while with the Camp of Israel  building up Winter Quarter on the west side of the Missouri  River then Indian Country I passsed passed through one of the most  painful scenes of my life and serious misfortune of any of my life  I took my ax and went 2 1/2 miles onto the bluffs to cut some shingle  timber to cover my cabin I was acompanied by two other men and  while falling the third tree ^which was an oak over two feet in diameter^ I steped backed of it some 8 feet and also one  side about the same distance where I thought I was entirely out of danger  but when the tree fell (being over two feet in diameter) ther being a crook  in the body of it, it struck a knowl on the ground and the whole body of the tree  shot end ways back of the stump and bounded & the but of the tree struck  me in the breast and knocked me several in the air against a standing  Oak and the falling tree followed me in its bend and caught me  against the standing tree and I came down between ^the two trees^ them one  standing & the other falling but before reaching the ground I was  liberated from between them and struck the ground upon my feet.  It badly bruised my left thigh the whole leangth of it and my hip  also my left arm it also broak my breast bone into also 3 ribs  on my left side it also bruised my lungs, vitals, and left side in  a shocking manor. After the accident I sat upon a log untill  Mr John Garrison went a quarter of a mile to get my horse. Notwith-  standing I was so badly hurt I had to mount my horse and ride  2 1/2 miles over a very rough road and had to dismout twice in  consequence of miry places, my breast and vitals was so badly torn  to peaces that each step of the horse went through me like an arrow  I continued on horsback untill I arived at Turky Creek on the  North side of Winter Quarters I then became exhausted & was taken  off and carried in a chair to my waggon not having a ^my^ cabin built  I was met in the street by president Brigham Young H. C Kimball, W  Richards & others who assisted in carrying me to my family. Before lying  me upon my bed the presidency laid hands upon me rebuked my suffering  & distress in the name of the Lord and said I should live and  not die. I was then laid upon my bed in my waggon and as  the Apostles prophesied upon my head so it came to pass I did live and  not die. I employed no physician on this occasion but was administered 
 to by the Elders of Israel and nursed by my wife I lay upon  my bed unabled to move untill my breast bone began to nit  together which commenced on the 9th day I began to walk about in  20 days from the time I was hurt and in 30 days from the time I was  hurt I again commenced hard labour. And It has always  appeared miraculous to me that with all the injuries and broken bones  that I have had, I have not a lame limb about me but have  been enabled ever since to endure the hardest manual labor,  exposure, hardships and injuries have even walked 40, 50 & on one occasion  60 miles in a day. However if I over labor or take a severe cold I  feel it more sensibly in my breast and left side than I did  before my last injury.  Thus I have occupied considerable space in  referring to those peculiar circumstances which here attending me ^thus far^ during life  and to sum the matter up it stands about thus. I have broaken  both legs (one twice in two) both arms, both ancles, my breast bone,  3 ribs, have been drowned, froze, & scalded. have been in two  water wheels under a full head of water, bitten by a mad dog  and passed through a score of other hair breadth escapes. Yet the  mercies of God have been over me, and my life has thus far  been preseved upon the Earth for which blessing I feel to render  the gratitude of my heart with thanksgiving to my Heavenly  Father praying that the remainder of my days, may be spent  in his service & the building up of his Kingdom    (Page 9th * History) Having embraced the fullness of the Everlasting Gospel of  Jesus Christ and seeing in it great beauty, power, glory & salvation  I had a great ^great^ desire to teach it to my ^the gospel fellow men, and this  desire increased upon me and rested with great wait upon my  mind but ^which^ I did not reveal this to any man ^person^. But one Sunday  evening I retired into the woods alone by myself and called upon  the Lord in earnest prayer to open my way to go and preach  the gospel of Salvation to the children of men ^inhabitants of the Earth^. The Spirit of the  Lord rested upon me & bore witness unto me that my prayer was  heard & should be answered upon my head. I arose from my  knees happy & walked some forty rods through a thick wood into  an open road, as I entered the road there stood before me  Judge Elias Higby an High Priest with whom I had been 
 closely associated having ^and^ lived in the same house for a number  of months but had never to my recollection said any thing to me  about preaching or ordination. But now as I approached him  he said Brother Wilford the Spirit of the Lord tells me that you  should be ordained & go and preach the gospel ^on a mission^. I said very well  if it is the will of the Lord I am ready.    At a meeting of the High Council at Lyman Wights Clay County Missouri  on the 5th day of Nov 1834 I was ordained to the office of a priest by the  directions of the High Council under the hands of Brother Simeon Carter  Stephen Winchester & Heman Hyde were ordained priests at the same time.    I called upon Bishop Edward Partridge and asked him what my  mission should be in what part of the country I should go to preach  the gospel. He replyed that I should ^Bishop Partridge said he would^ like to have some of the Brethren ^me^ go into  the Southern States through Arkansas Tennesee Kentucky &c if I could find  any body who had faith enough to go ^with me^ for it would be a hard mission  and a hard ^dangerous^ county to travel in at present in consequence of the Missouri  persecutions. I told him I was as ready to go South as any where else if he  wished it. As Arkansas lay South of Missouri I asked him if I  should go through Jackson County as it lay direct in our path ^route^ he said  it would be at the risk of ones life & I have not got faith enough to  undertake it if you have you can try it, I asked him if I went  through Jackson County if I should start without purse or scrip as in  general terms that seemed ^according^ to be the law ^of God^. He said that he had not got  faith enough to start on a mission through Jackson County without money  and if I dare it I must do it on my own faith. As the commandments  required the Elders to go out without purs or scrip I felt strenous to keep  the commandments so I ^started without money^ resolved that to go without purse or scrip   I wished to have some companion go with my ^up^ on my mission I did  not wish to launch forth into the open world alone. I called upon  Elder Harry Brown (who had accompanied me from Richland New York to Clay Co  Missouri) and asked him if he would not accompany me it met his  wishes and Bishop Partridge gave him his mission with me. And  we immediately ^prepared^ ourselves to start upon our journey And on the 13th day of Jan  1835 I recieved the following recommend in connexion with my priests license  ((Liberty, Clay County, Missouri, Jan 13 1835 This certifies that Wilford Woodruff  has faithfully discharged evry duty required of him in the Camp of the Saints  on the 13 day Jan 1835 I received an honorable discharge from Lyman Wight from  the duties of Zions Camp and 
 in journeying from Kirtland Ohio to this place has been very faithful  in the discharge of his duty since his arival here both temporally and spiritually  is strong in the faith of the Latter Day Saints and worthy of his calling  He is recommended by the Church in this place to any branch where providence  may call him.

He had an Osage squaw for a   wife she got us a good supper but marvelled that we did not drink coffee  she offered us their best bed which was highly ornamented and adorned but   we refused ^Declined^ her kind offer as we were wet & muddy she then made   us a good bed of Mocasin blankets before a large fire and we slept  comfortably untill morning. May the Lord reward both Mr Jerew & wife &  the prysbeterian Minister according to their desires))    2nd page 11. ((On the 24th Jan I preached at Mr Nathan Turners in   Green County Missouri it being the first time that we had found a  congregation during our journey that we could get together and preach  to in safety, & the first time that I had ever attempted to, preach the  gospel to a congregation in the capacity of a priest or missionary I had   good liberty & was followed by Elder Brown ther was a hard snow storm  during the time)) 
 History of Wilford Woodruff    In traceing the history of my Fathers I find it difficult to obtain a satisfactory   account of the Woodruff family (from whom I descended) for more than   three generation. I learn from the English Book of Heraldry that    Woodruff supposed to be one of my Ancestors was Lord Mayor  of the City of London at the time of the great fire in AD 1649 My Great   Grand Father Josiah Woodruff lived nearly one hundred years of age and   possessed a strong Iron Constitution and performed a great amount of   manual labour nearly up to the time of his death. His wifes name was   Sarah. He had by her nine children as follows Josiah, Appleton, Eldad  Elisha, Joseph, Roda, Phebe & 2 names not given. One of his daughters married  married a Chase the other a man by the name of North  My Grandfather Eldad Woodruff was the third son of Josiah   Woodruff. He was born ^in Farmington Hartford County Connecticut^ in 1751. He like his father possessed a   strong constitution it was considered ^said^ that he performed the   most manual labor for several years of any man in Hartford   County Ct. but from over exertion in hewing timber he had a  severe ^was^ attack of the ^with^ rheumatism in his right hip which caused a  severe lameness in his righ for several years before his death  He married Dinah Woodford by whom he had 7 children as follows  Eldad, Elizabeth, Samuel, Aphek, Titus, Hellen, & Ozem.   Eldad Married Lewey Woodford, Elizabeth Amasa Frisby. Samuel Miss Case,  Aphek Bulah Thompson, & Azubah Hart. Titus Louisa Allan, Hellen Amos  Wheeler & Ozem Acksa Merrill & Hannah Hart, all of which had a  numerous families of children. My Grand Father died ^in Farmington Ct^ with an attack of the  ^the^ spotted fever in 1806 aged 55 years. My Grand Mother Dinah Woodruff  died in 1824 ^aged the same place^ in Farmington Ct with a cancer in the left breast. Her sufferings   were very great.    My Father Aphek Woodruff was born in Farmington Hartford County Ct   November 11th 1778.  Married Bulah Thompson who was born 1782 Married Nov 29, 1801  by whom he had three children, Azmon, born Nov 29 1802. Ozem Thompson born   Dec 22nd 1804. Wilford born March 1st 1807. My Mother Bulah Woodruff died   with an attack of the spoted fever June 11th 1808 aged 26 years leaving me 15 months   old at her death. My Father married for his second wife Azubah Hart Nov born July 31st   18 1792 Married Nov 9th 1810, by whom he had 6 children 
 Philo born Nov 29 th 1811. Died by poison administered by a physician Nov 25 1827 aged   16 years. Asahel Hart born April 11 th 1814. Died ^in Terrahaut In^ October 18th, 1838. Aged 24.  Franklin born March   12 1816 died June 1st 1816 aged 2 months 19 days.  Newton born June 19, 1818 drowned   Sept 1820 aged 2 years & 3 months. Julius born April 22nd 1821 died in infancy  Eunice born June 19th 1820. Married to Dwight I baptized her into the Church of Jesus Christ  of Latter day Saints July 1st 1838 I married her to Dwight Webster in Farmington Ct  Aug 4th 1841. My Father Aphek Woodruff like his Father was a strong constitu-  tioned man, has done a great amout of labour all of his life. He commenced   attending a flouring mill & a saw mill at 18 years of age which business he has  now  continued in for about 50 years, most of the time he has laboured through the day & one half  of the night. He never made any profession of religion untill I baptized him with all   his household into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints on the 1st day of   July 1838. Although my Father was not a professor of religion He was a   man of great charity, honesty, integrity, & truth. He made himself poor as to  wealth by giving to the poor & accomodating his fellow man by loaning money   and being surety for his neighbor, and always saying yes to evry man who asked   a favor at his hand.    I was born in the North part of the town of Farmington now called Avon, Hatford ^Hartford^   Co Ct, March 1st 1807. I followed the same occupation of my Father  that of a Miller from my youth up until 1831. I assisted my ^Father^ in attending   the Farmington Mills untill I was 20 years of age, in the spring of 1827 I took  the flouring Mill of my Aunt Hellen Wheeler which I attended 3 years. In the  spring of 1830 I took charge of the flouring Mill of Mr Collins the Ax manufacturer  in South Canton Ct, at the end of one year it was demolished to make way for   other Machinery, in the spring of 1831, I took charge of the flouring Mill   owned by Mr Richard B. Cowles of New Hartford Connecticut. In the   spring of 1832 in company with my oldest brother Azmon Woodruff I   went to Richland Oswago County N York & purchased a farm & saw Mill  & setled down in business for awhiles.    Variant & divers are the lives & fortunes of man in every age of the world. While the  path of some are strewn with flowers & ease from the cradle to the graves with  naught to disturb their peace others apparently are marked victims of variated  misfortune accidents & dangers. The last named class is the one in whose ranks  I have stood through my infancy childhood youth & manhood up to the present  time so much so that it has seemed as though some invisible power or fate was 
 watching my footsteps in order to find some opportunity to take my life from  the Earth but I can ownly attribute the continuation of my life on Earth  to the present time to a merciful God whose hand has been streched out & rescued  me from death in the midst of the many dangers and hair breadths escapes which I   have passed through in life some of which I will here mention    When three years of age I fell into a caldron of boiling water was instantly caught out  & so badly scalded that is was 9 months before I was considered out of danger. When  five years of age I fell from the great beam of a barn upon my face upon the beam floor  which came near breaking my neck three months afterwards I broke one of my  arms falling down a pair of stairs.  I soon broke the other arm falling out of   a high stoop across some timber. When six years of age I came near being killed  by a surly bull and was ownly saved as it were by a miracle. During the same year  I went into my Fathers saw mill with several other children I got upon the head block  to take a ride while running the carriage back not anticipating any danger but before  I was aware of it my leg was caught between the head block & fender post & broak  both bones in two below the knee I was taken to the house & lay 9 hours before my  bones was set which time was spent amid severe pain: but being young my bones  soon nit together & in few weeks I was again upon my feet attending to the sports of  my youth. During my confinement with this lameness my brother Thompson was my  companion in the same room going through with a course of the typus fever  When 7 years of age I was riding on the top of a load of hay which my Uncle  Ozem Woodruff was driving to the barn when he turned the load over on top of   me and before it was I was nearly strangled for the want of air before it was removed  from me. While 8 years of age I was riding in a one horse waggon with   several others to go to our labor the horse took fright ran down a steep hill and   turned us over with the waggon on top of us. But again while in the midst of danger  my life was preserved none of us was seriously injured. While 9 years of age I clumb ^climbed^  into an Elim tree to obtain some bark. I steped upon a dry tree limb and I fell  about 15 feet upon my back which apparently beat the breath out of my body a cousin  ran & told my parents I was dead, before they arrived at the spot I came to my senses  arose upon my feet & met my Parents coming to me. At 12 years of age I  was drowned in Farmington River & sunk in 30 feet of water and was miraculously  saved by a young man named Bacon, I suffered much in being restored to life  At 13 years of age while passing through Farmington meadows in the depth of   winter with the roads drifted with snow and in an exceeding blustering day I became 
 Became so chilled & overcome with cold I could not travel, I crawled into the  hollow of a large tree to rest me. A man in the distance seeing me go into it  hastened to my ^rescue^ realizeing more fully than I did the danger I was in when he arrived  at the spot I had fallen asleep & was nearly insensible, he had much difficulty in  arousing me to a sens of my situation. He procured means to convey me to my  Fathers house and through a kind profidence my life was again preserved    At 14 years of age I split my left instep open with an ax which went nearly   through my foot & ^it^ was 9 months getting well. At 15 years of age I was bitten in   my left hand by a mad dog in the last stage of the Hydrophobia. He ownly clamped  my hand with his teeth but did not draw blood and I was preserved through  the mercy of God from an awful death. At the age of 17 I met with an accident  which caused me much suffering & came near ending my life. I was riding a very  ill tempered horse which I was not acquainted with, and while going down a very steep  rocky hill the horse took the advantage of the ground suddenly leaped from the road & ran  down the steepest part of the hill amid the thicket & the rocks at full speed and he commenced  kicking up at the same time & about landing me over his head among the rocks but I lodged  on the top of his head grasped one hand hold of each ear as with a death grasp expecting evry  moment to be dashed to peaces against the rocks while in this position sitting astride his neck  with no bridle to guide him but his ears he plunged down the hill among the rocks with all  force ^speed^ untill he ran against a rock which dashed him to the Earth I went over his head  & the rock about one rod & struck the ground square upon my being the ownly thing  visible that saved my life, for had ^I^ struck upon any othe part of my body it must have   killed me instantly, as it was my boenes bones crushed from under me as though they  were reeds. It broke my left leg twice in two & put out both of my ancles in a   shocking manner, and the horse came nigh rolling over me in his struggles to  get up. ^My uncle Titus Woodruff saw^ An uncle of mine saw me fall, hastened to my relief got amist me &  & carried me to his house in an arm chair, I lay from 2 oclok till 10 at night  without ^medical aid^ assistance then my Father arrived bringing Dr T Swift of Farmington with him  who set my bones boxed up my limbs & carried me in his carriage 8 miles that   night to my Fathers house my sufferings were very great yet I had good attention  & in 8 weeks I was outdoors upon my cruches & soon was all well again  In 1827 while attending the Flouring Mill attempting to clear the ice out of a water  wheel standing upon the wheel with one arm around the shaft a man hoisted the gate  let a full head of water upon it as soon as the water struck it it stopped my feet  sliped into [word covered] I immediately plunged head fore most over the rim of the 
 wheel into about 3 feet of water and my weight drew my legs  out of the wheel or I should have been drawn under a shaft & crushed   to death. In 1831, while having charge of the Flouring Mill in Collinsv-  ville Ct I was standing inside of a breast wheel 20 feet in diameter  upon one of the arms near the top clearing out the ice when a full head of   water was let onto it it immediately started. I dropped my ax and leaped  through the wheel to the bottom of it by the shaft & arms about 20 feet as I struck  the bottom of the wheel I was rolled out against a ragged stone well with ownly   about 2 feet clearance between it & the wheel the wheel caught me & rolled ^me^ out  into the water below where I found myself without any broken bones but with  some bruises & much fright. ^*see paper apart^ In 1833 the day I was baptized into the  Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints one of my horses newly calked  kicked my hat of my head & had he struck 2 inches lower would probably   have killed me instantly. In 10 minutes afterwards while driving the same horses  down a hill on a sled without any box the bottom boards sliped forward  under the roll caught the ground turned endways fell on the horses badly  throwing me between the horses they ran to the bottom of the hill draging me  by the lines head foremost with the steed top of me about rods over  a smooth snow path I escaped unharmed however in the midst of both dangers  In 1834, while travelling in Zions Camp to Missouri a rifle was accidentally  discharged & the ball passed through three tents with a dozen men in each & lodged  in a waggon axletree with a man standing against it it injured no one. It passed within  a few inches of my breast & many others escaped as narrowly as my self    A few months afterwards a musket was accidentally snaped with the muzzle pointing at  my breast within a few feet of me heavily loaded with buck shot but it missed fire  and my life was again preserved.  In April 1839 in Rochester Ill I was riding  upon the running gears of a waggon without any box, I was sitting upon the fore ward  axletree and the bolt came out fastening the cupling pole this left the hind wheels & my  weight on the forward bolster & tongue turned the coupling pole clear over onto the horses  backs, turned the stakes upside down & shut me up fast between the boulster & tongue  but in such a manner that my head & shoulders dragged on the ground my horses  took fright and ran out into an open pari prairie & thus draged me in this position  for about half a mile when I managed so as to guide them with my left hand so   as to to run them into a corner of a high worm fence where we landed in a pile  together, I was considerably bruised but landed withou escaped without any broken bones 
 see paper apart*  & after one days rest was enabled to attend to my labors again (see paper apart)  Thes I have occupied considerable space in refering to those peculiar circumstances  which have attended me during life. And to sum the matter up it stands about those  I have broaken both legs (one twice in two) both arms, & both ancles ^my breast bone & 3 ribs^ ^my breast bone & 3 ribs^ have been   drowned froze & scalded, & bit with a mad dog, have been in two water wheels under  a full head of water *  ^have passed through several severe fits of sickness encountered poison in the worst forms, landed in a pile of rail road ruins have bearly missed the passing bullet^ I have passed through a score of other hair breadth escapes &  Yet the protection & mercy of God has been over me, and my life there from has  been preserved upon the Earth for which blessing I feel to render the gratitude  of my heart to my Heavenly Father praying that the remained of my days may be spent  in his service and the building up of his kingdom *) ^It has appeared mirraculous to me that with all the injuries and broaken bones which I have met with with I have^ not a lame limb about me but have ever since  been enabled to endure  the ever since the hardest labour and exposures and journies have ^often^ walked 40, 50 and on one  occasion 60 miles in a day  At an early age my mind began to be ^was^ exercised upon religious subjects. But  I never made a profession of religion untill 1830, being 23 years of age I did not then   join any church ^for the reason that I could not find any^ for the reason body of people or denomination or Church whos  had for their foundation, doctrin, tenets, faith or practice, ^agreed with^ the gospel of Jesus Christ or   the ordinances ^&^ gifts & practices which Christ & the Apostles taught  & practiced ^in their day^  in there day & generation for the salvation of the children of Man Although the   teachers of the day taught that the faith, gifts, graces, miracles, & ordinances which   the prophets, Savior & the Apostles enjoyed were done away & no longer needed I did   not believe a word of it to be true ownly as they were done away through the unbeliefs  of the children of men I believed the same gifts graces miracles & power would be   manifest the same in one age of the world as in another when God did have a Church   & kingdom upon the Earth, I did not believe that the Church of Christ did exist   upon the Earth in an organized form, but I believed there had been a falling away  from the Apostolic order of things,  but that the Church & kingdom of God would be  esstablished upon the Earth in my day & generation and that I should live to see it.   This principle was rivited upon my mind from two causes 1st from the perusal of the   Old & New Testament with fervent prayer that the Lord would show me what was   right & wrong & lead me in the path of salvation, without any regard to the opinions of man  & the whisperings of the spirit of the Lord unto me for the space of three years did teach ^taught^  me in accordance with the ^written^ word of God that He was about to set up his Church & Kingdom   upon the Earth in the last days ^and that his "righteousness was about to be revealed & his salvation to come forth"^ ^as said the Prophet Isaiah in his 56 chapter^ And secondly I was taught this principle from my youth  up to manhood by an aged man by the name of Robert Mason who lived in Simsbury   Ct who was frequently called the old prophet Mason, ^who taught^ who did teach me many things   which are now coming to pass. He prophesied of many of those events which are now take  place. He did not believe that any man upon the Earth in the midst of the Christian Nations 
 ^Had authority^ to administer in the ordinances of the House of the Lord but believed that it was our  privilege through faith, prayer, & fasting to heal the sick, & cast out devils by the laying on of   hands which was the case under his administration as numbers could testify.  I was living in this state of mind & in this faith & belief looking for the coming forth of  the Church of Christ when I heard of what was called Mormonism. In 1832 I  was loudly called upon by the spirit of the Lord to go to the state of Rhode Island one of  my brother ^Asahel^ was also called to go to the same place & at the same time when we met  we both told our feelings & what the spirit of the Lord had whispered unto us & we marvelled   & wondered what the Lord wanted of us in Rhode Island, but as we had made preparations   to move to the west we let outward circumstances controll us, and like Jonah instead of going to   Ninivah went to Tarshis, so we instead of going to Rhode Island went to Richland Oswego County  N. York, and there remained until the 29 day of Dec 1833 before I heard a gospel sermon  by a latter day saint.  I then soon learned what the Lord wanted of us in Rhode Island  for at the time we were commanded ^warned^ of the Lord to go there, two of the Elders of the Latter day  Saints were preaching there & had we gone we certainly should have embraced the  work at that time, but as it was we had to wait for the next call  On the 29th day of Dec 1833, Elder Zera Pulsipher & Elijah Cheeny called  at my house & gave out an appointment for preaching in the school house in that  neighborhood that [illegible] evening I attended as did my brother Azmon Woodruff  We both believed, invited the Elders to our home & offered ourselves  for baptism the first sermon we heard. We read the Book of Mormon  & had a testimony that it was true.
