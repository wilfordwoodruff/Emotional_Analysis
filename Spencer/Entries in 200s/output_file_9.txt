 May 1, 1847 ~ SaturdayMay 1st 1847 [FIGURE] This was an interesting day to the hunters of the Camp of Israel. It was vary cold Ther stood at 30° with strong North windthe hunters put out & the camp started on the Journey. Before breakfast travled 6 miles & camped on the Prairie in sight of a herd of buffalo of 200 feeding on the bluff to our right. three ownly of the hunters started out after them they rode near them & left their horses & cralled upon them to get a shot but they frightend the herd & they run away. A little previous to themain herds being seen 3 bulls were discoverd on the bluff O. P. Rockwell & two others went after them & wounded two but got neither of them we had not travled more than 2 miles before we discoverd another large herd of about 200, 5 miles ahead of us the hunters got together held a council & waited untill the camp all came up we were determined to get some of the buffalo if possible we travled together untill we were within one mile of the buffalo we then made a halt, & 15 hunters started outAmasa Lyman & myself of the Twelve made two of the numbber we all travled together on to the bluffs within a few rods of them & there divided out into companies Br Grover & Luke Johnson went together into the bluffs O. P. Rockwell & Br Brown took the entire left & so we divided into compa-nies on the right left & center I was in a company in the centre of the herd & we all made a charge upon them from the bluffs & rushed on to the Plain, the herd run vary fast down the ruff bluffs into the plain but when we came up to the plain we soon came on to them each company singled out his game we made choice of Cows generally then rushed up by the side of them & fired upon them with our Pistols such as horse Pistols Rifle Pistols &c which are much better to carry than rifles as they are vary cumberson in runing the first that we gave chase to was a Buffaloo Cow with her calf I rode by the side of her & fired two balls from my Pistols into her. the other Brethren with me also fired into her untill we killed we cut her throat I then run my horse to the assistance of another Party who had wounded one & that one was also soon dispatched. I then saw O. P. Rockwell. had 3 bulls at bay on the Prairie Br Pack & myself run our horses to his assistance & Br Kimball came up at the same time we surrounded them & commenced firing upon them they bolted ahead I put spirs to my horse & run in ahead of them was in about one rod of them they all Pitched at ^me^ & gave me chase for fight & I had tobe quick to get out of their way but soon cleared them two of them broke for the bluff Br Brown put for themRockwell, Kimball, Pack & myself stuck to the old bull I fired 2 balls into him, Br Kimball one, Br Pack one & he fell dead, & we cut his throat, & also shot a clalf that was with him, the two that had left us that Brown was after was in the bluffs more than a mile from us Br Kimball & myself gave chase to them & as we got in about 20 rods of the bluff we saw two come out & run for the main herd we gave chase for a while but they were fresh & my horse had run near 10 miles 
 in the chase so we gave up the persuit I returned to Br Brown in the bluffs & found that one of the bulls he had given chase to was near dead had lain dead down but Br Brown had no more Powder or Ball but before I arived he had got up & run into the herd on the bluff, so we all returned on our chase ground to gather up the meat, we had killed in all 3 cows one bull & 5 calves making 11 in all. Br Solomon Hancock went out in the morning on to the bluffs to kill buffalo on footHe did not come in at night we felt concerned about himearly in the morning he came in, had killed a 3 year old cow& watched it over night to keep the volves from eating it 3 wolves came upon him he shot one the rest run away this made 12 buffalo in all that the hunters killed to day which we considered was doing vary well considering that we were nearly all strangers to that mode of hunting as but vary few of us ever saw a wild buffalo before in our lives we dressed out meat & waggons came from camp to take it in. A part of this chase was through one of the largest Prairie dog towns nearly ever seen it was nearly ten miles long & 2 wide & full of burrows nearly evry rod & great danger of a horse stepinginto them & falling, there was no accident happened at all to any one which was truly a blessing my horse stumbledon[c]e & come nigh falling but no harm done this was the first buffalo hunt I ever took part in or sawwe travled to day with the camp 18 mileswe discovered Indian fires on the south & west of usMay 2, 1847 ~ Sunday2nd Suunday All were busy cooking & saving there meatin the afternoon we moved up 3 miles for better feed & camped by the side of a large slew of water our camping place last night & this morning was at the head of Grand IslandProfessor Pratt took an observation for the Lattitude & found it to be 40° 41' 42" this agrees with Freemonts obervation within 2 miles & his was on the south side of the river which was 2 miles south of our camping place we came through another large dog town to day, soon after we camped a herd of buffalo came from the bluffs to the river to drink within about 2 miles of us & then returned to the bluffssome were anxious to go after them, but as it was Sunday Br Young thought it best to let them be untill tomorrow the Indians set fire to the Prairie before us which burnt rapedly over a large region of country Brs Young Kimball & several others went several miles in the evening on our road to examine the fire & other things. distance 3 milesMay 3, 1847 ~ Monday3rd The hunters were called together in the morning 20 in number to go into the bluffs for a still hunt for bluffs buffalo & other game we started out with two waggons to bring in the game I had taken a severe cold & setled in my side whare I was hurt last fall & it made me sick & I was not able to go out yet I started with the company as I was among the hunters I had Jar[r]ed myself 
 badly in my hard buffalo chase on Saturday & I now was feeling its effects at the same time the hunters started. Another company was formed to go & explore out the rout & see if we could get grass for our horses as the Indians had been burning it up for several days. We went into the bluffs & seperated into two Parties 10 in each & we travled some 10 miles back & & forth over the hills& saw no game except antelope & wolvesNo I felt so unwell I concluded to go back to camp. A Lyman & 3 others were with me. we set down upon the edgeof the bluff in sight of the camp to rest ourselves & we saw a company of 20 horsman approaching ^us^ from thecamp in haste bearing a red flag when they got within half a mile of us we trailed our arms & went downto meet them. they informed us that the party that went up the river had come upon an encampment of about 400 Indian warriors. A party of about 100 had followed them down a ravene to cut off their retreat probably with the Intention of rob[b]ing themof their horses & clothing & would take life if they couldnot do it with out & this company of horsman had come to us to call in the hunters to camp so we went in the hunters in coming in with thehorsman came across a herd of buffalo & broughtinto camp 3 calf, & 4 antelope they kept out a goodguard during the night & we had no disturbance the cannon was fired twice early in the morning to let the Indians know we were awake. I had a vary severe night with my side was in much pain wehad some ^a great^ dew & frost during the night. 12May 4, 1847 ~ Tuesday4th Thermometer stands at 33° this morning I feelsome better than I did last night we started onour journey this morning 5 waggons a breast which made 5 roads this was to be in readiness in case of an attack from the Indians we travled 3 miles & saw some waggons on theopposite side of the river. going down the Platt soon one of the men waded the Platt & came to us, to see who we were. He info-rmed us they were traders from fort Laramee he had been there 3 years had not tasted bread for 2 years, was 16 days fromLaramee the grass was green & good on the south side to thatfort but burnt of on the North side He waided the Platt tocome to us a mile across it & did not go but little above his knees He would take letters to us to Sarpee who lived near winter Quarters so the campe stoped & wrote 52 letters to our familys I was ahead of the company with O Pratt takingobservations & did not know untill the time was nearly upI then in great haste scribbled a few lines to my wife An epistle was written to the Church &c. Three Brethren accompanied the Frenchman accross the Platt to the other men was 9 in allhad not seen an Indian since they left Laramee, stated theirwas a ferry at the fort &c agreed to take our letters safewe drove on 3 miles more & bated our teams untill the Brethren returned they made a report to the camp of what was said to them a Council of the whole camp was then called to deside whether we would cross the Platt or continue up 
 the North side of it we were convinced that it wood be better for us as a company to cross the river on [illegible] take theold travled road to Laramee as their was good grass on the way on that side while the Indians were burning it all off on the North side of the river where we were travling but when we took into consideration the situation of the next company & thousands that would follow after & as we were the Pioneers & had not our wives & children with us we thought it best to keep on the north side of the river & brave the difficulties of burning Prairies & make a road that should stand as a permanant rout for the Saints indipendant of the old emigration rout & let the river seperate the emigrating companies that they need not quarrel for wood grass or water & when our next company came along the grass would be much better for them than it would on thesouth side as it would grow up by the time they would get along. A vote was called & it was unanimous to go on the north side of the river. So the camp again moved on, but during the nooning Col Markham drilled the men in a military capacity, they unshiped the cannon & carriedit on wheels, the Frenchman informed us that he never saw so many buffalo [on] on the rout this year they had to stop several times to let the herd pass so they could get along, we saw many deer & antelope to day & also wolves and a few buffalo one large bull came across theriver to us, we rode onto the bank before him & he run clear back again upon a loap & again crossed below uswe camped at night at a gravel creek or slew a large herd of buffalo lay but a short distance before uswe travled in all to day 9 m 9 milesMay 5, 1847 ~ Wednesay5th I was quite sick with the diaree the change from salt to fresh meat is affecting a number in campThe 400 Indian warriors that was supposed to be seen on the 3rd proved to be fals the man was frightened at a herd of antelope & supposed them to be Indianswe had to keep a guard out this morning to keepa herd of buffalo from mixing up with our cattlewe have had vary strong south wind for 2 days,two buffalo bulls at noon were approaching the herd of cows & men went out & drove them off we rode up within 3 rods of one that was asleep &stoped & looked at him for some minutes he awoke & shook himself & loaped off we met a large herdin the afternoon the Brethren killed one cow5 calves & brought a bull calf into camp a livewith the intention of raising it, it would drink water out of a pail they had some sport in triyingto make it suckle a cow it would try hard to bunt the men & dogs over & some got hard raps I have been obliged to keep my bed a part of the day havesuffered much with bowel complaint, when we stoped for night we soon found ourselves inthe midst of grass on fire & had to return back 
 one mile & camped on a spot of ground on the bank of the river that was just burned over & no feed except small patches some took there horses on anIsland near & cut down cotton wood for themwe travled to day 15 milesMay 6, 1847 ~ Thursday6th I was some better this morning we had some rain last night I had a poor nights rest. we started early this morning without feeding (except a little corn) as there wasno grass & travled 3 miles & got beyond the fire left it in our rear & stop to bait & breakfast on a good spot of grass, this morning the herds of buffalo speck the plains on both sides of the river and antelope in great abundance some of which run into camp, the buffalo calf is dead this morningthat was brought into camp alive last night we continuedour journey saw many herds of buffalo antelope & one large herd of elk a young buffalo clalf came into camp & followedus we gave him some milk & left him we travled 10 miles & nooned on the prairie. we scarsly meet with any timber now, two antelope were killed this forenoon but as we have so much meet in camp it is thought best not to kill any morebuffalo untill we need it or any other game. we were visited atnoon with many buffalo Dr Richards G. A. Smith & myself walkedup quite near several buffalo herds & exhamined them through our glasses they were sheding their coats one bull had a mat of wool swining by his side, like a loose robe, our herd of cows started to run among the buffalo & President Young run his horse to seperate them & had great difficulty in doing itHe lost a spy glass in the chase worth $40, the Brethrenhunted for it a long time but could not find it wecontinued to journey among the herds of buffalo & we are not out of sight of them at all they have eat the grass out to such a degree that our cattle & horses can get but vary little to eat we camped near a herd at night that reached as far as our eyes could extendthere were thousands in it distance of the day 20 mMay 7, 1847 ~ Friday7th A meeting was called one of the herdsman recieved a sharp reproof for neglecting the cows yesterday a teemwas called for to take the canon we had an exceding cold north wind to day we travled 6 miles & camped uponthe bank of the river I should judge we saw 10,000buffalo to day we came near large herds with a greater proportion than usual of calves, yearlings & two year olds we saw several large ones mired, dead, wolves had commenced eating some of them we could see wolves upon evry hand following the herds of buffalo to eat those who die ofwounds, accident or poverty. we had some rain in the evening. President Young & others rode out in the 6 mileevening to search out the road a few miles forward & for the first time on the journey saw & killed a polecat or skunk. The Rigment was called out in the evening & drilledArms inspected &c & found in good order. It was supposed an Indian was seen crossing the river in the night but was stoped & did not get ashore 
 May 8, 1847 ~ Saturday8th A plesant morning. not so cold & winday as yesterdaywe did not start untill 10 oclok as our teams wanted rest as they could not get much as the buffalo had eat all the feed upBr Wm Clayton prepared a mile gage on his hind waggon wheel to know how far we travel, I rode forward to day with the Twelve & others & of all the sights of buffalo that our eyes beheld was enough to asstonish man thousands upon thousands would crould together as they came from the bluffs to the bottom land to go to the river & slues to drink untill the river& land upon both sides of it was one dark spectacle of moving objects it looked as though the face of the [e]arth was alive & moving like the waves of the sea. Br Kimball remarkedthat he had herd many buffalo tales told but he never expe-cted to behold what his eyes now saw the half had not been told him we saw many dead scattered about & many wolves following the herds, when we stoped at noon many of them walked along by the side of our waggons so that we might easily have shot them down, O P Rockwell did shoot one through the neck & she droped dead it was a two year old heifer & good meet there were a great num[ber] of calves & young cattle in the herds we saw to day we saw had great difficulty in keeping our cattle & horses from going among them for if they once get mixed with a herd it is almost impossible to ever get them again. we travled to day untill we came to the bluffs that made down to the river & camped for the night distance 11 1/4 miI went onto the top of the highest bluffs that were near us & took a survey of the surrounding country with our glasses there being present B. Young H. C. Kimball W Woodruf[f] & G A Smith the whole sourrounding country north east & west as far as our vision could extend looked as rough as the sea in a storm of ridges & valleys of mostly sand with scarcely any green thing upon it except a little scattering grass & the Spanish soap root such as the mexicans use for washing with instead of soap the top resembles a pine apple the most of any thing I ever saw I brought in one root 24 24 inch long 2 inch in diameter I pounded a little of it up & it would fill a dish with suds like soapMay 9, 1847 ~ Sunday9th Sunday As we had no feed around us we took up [FIGURES] our teams & passed across the bluffs 4 miles & camped for the day I wrote 2 letters one to Br Ferguson & the other to Br Bevin for Br Wolley to take with him to Purbelo we had a meeting & a good one the spirit of God rules over the camp. Peace quietn[ess] & contentment seems to pervade almost evry breast. the Twelve met & thought it best for the Brethren not to start for Pueblo untill they arive at Laramey. In the evening I rode with the Twelve & others 4 miles up the river & returned we saw large herds of buffalo come to there watering places to drink, some geese, cranes & one pole cat 8 milesMay 10, 1847 ~ Monday10th A cool morning. Before leaving the camp ground a letter was written to the next camp put into a small box nailed to a post 12 feet long one end put firm in the ground the 
 other end erect in the air as a guide bord containing the following words. Open this box and you will find a letter.316 miles to winter Quarters, Pioneers. Lattitude 41°. (our friends no doubt will be glad to get the letter as it contains an account of our Journey.We travled 6 miles & nooned then travled 4 & camped for the night our teams are some weak in consequence of not getting grass for several days as it was eat out by the buffalo there was one buffalo, one deer & one hare brought into camp by the hunters to day, & distributed among the men in camp we have what fresh meat we want dailythe grass is some better to day not but few herds of buff-alo on our rout, today we passed through some miles of dead grass which we set on fire to have new feed for the next company it made a great fire indeed we get our distance daily now of our travel from a mashine fixed to a waggon wheel which gives the true distancewe camped to night by an Island of cotton wood 10 mMay 11, 1847 ~ Tuesday11th quite warm to day we travled 5 miles & made a short halt then travled 3 1/2 miles & camped a little below the junktion of the Noth & south forks of the Platt River I felt quite unwell the use of fresh meet does not as yet agree vary well with me 8 1/2 mileswe see but few buffalo today some antelope & Deer &cProfessor Pratt informed me that he took an observation for the Longitude May 7th on the opposite bank of the Platt from whare Freemont gives the Longitude in his travels Professor Pratt made the Longitude to be 100° 5' 45" making it two seconds of a degree less than Freemont ownly about 10 rods which was vary close calculating. He also found the Lat 1/2 a mile west of this nights encampment to be 41° 7' 44"May 12, 1847 ~ Wednesday12th A cool morning. Mercury stands at 41, we had a strong S. wind through the day we travled 8 miles & nooned we then travled 4 miles & camped for the night on the bank of the North fork of the Platt I rode onto the bluffs to take a survey of the country which was about 3 miles from the river & we found both on the hills & flatts through the day, travel that we were traveling over the Soux hunting ground there had been a large band from 500 to 1000 we should judge from there signs over the ground from 8 to 10 days before us, they took the brains out of the large buffalogenerally their hides & some of the meet & broke up the bones for the marrow, 20 100 calves were found dead in one place with nothing taken but the tongues, legs to the knee& entrails another place 35 calves were found dead & washed in heaps whare the buffalo had been chased acrosse the river & run over the calves in rising the bank of the river. I found on the bluff their medicine bag tied to a stick 6 feet long stuck up in the bank it was what is called kinikinnick composed of tobacco & bark to smoke I also found a saddle tied to a large buffalo dung I supposed to show the next party which way the buffalo had gone I left my horse in the valley to feed while I went onto a bluff to see the country & he started off not seeing the camp took the back tract 
 & I had to run after him & while following him,I run through the great Soux encampmen whare they had had there lodges while on their hunt I left my gun there & followed my horse untill I overtook him with the assistance of Br Fowler who came out from the encampment & stoped him I then rode back got my gun examined the ground & should judge their had been 500 lodges there was acres of ground cove[re]d with buffalo wool whare they had dressed there skinsthey left much stuff scattered over the ground such as peaces of dressed buffalo & wolf skins mogascins &c I brought in a good dressed white wolf skindistance of the day 12 milI could see the bluff between the forks of the river about 10 miles above us the bluffs that I passed over to day were more fertile & covered with more grass than any I had seen on the Platt before a young buffalo was killed & brought in in the eveningMay 13, 1847 ~ Thursday13 Many of the Brethren went out to visit the Indian encampment & brought in mogasens, parts of robes leather &c, we have a strong cold nort[h] wind to day, we travled to day 11 miles & camped on the west bank of a stream about 12 rods wide with good ford that empties into the Platt this is nearly opposite the first bluff that is formed between the two forks of the Platt, the grass was better th[an] it had had been, the bluff here for the first time on the north fork comes hold to the river so that we have to go over the bluffs with our waggonsthere is one thing concerning the Platt river which is worthy of note, which is not characteristic of any other river that I have any knowledge of in the worldit is much of the way a mile in wedth & generally coverd with water but vary shallow when a South wind blows hard the water all rushes to the north shore untill one would suppose there was a great rise in the water let the wind shift & bolow hard from the North & the watter immediately leaves the north shore untill one can walk across two thirds of the river on bare ground & the river constantly ebs & flows like the tide just according as the wind blowsI went onto the bluffs hunting buffalo in the evening saw several small herds President Young gave the stream we camped on the name of the bluff fork.I dreamed last night we had arived at our journey end whare we were to build up a stake of Zion. As we came unto the place there was an open vision of a temple presented before me I asked some brethren that stood by me If they saw it they said they did not I gazed upon it & it was glorious it appeared as though it was built of white & blue stone the sight of it filled me with Joy and I awoke, & behold it was a dream 11 m 
 May 14, 1847 ~ Friday14th I went out early in the morning to hunt some buffalo I cashed myself in the bank & a large herd came along, but their old bulls was out as a rear & front guard & there was none of their young cattle near enough for me to shooht so they past by I saw some more coming I way laid them they proved to be 7 bulls I fired at the youngest one while [he] passed bybut missed him I then returned to camp tookbreakfast had a hard shower of rain & some words with Br Fowler & started out again hunting Br Higby soon Killed an antelope that was put on board of a boat called the revenue cutter Phineas Young& myself went out together waited for buffalo & antilope I finally got lost among the bluff, but found my way out again Br Phineas shotan buck antilope & I carried him into campthere was 3 antilope & one buffalo bull killed. some of the hunters thought they herd Indian guns on the opposit side of theriver during the night an Indian cralled up to a pair of mulesthat was tied togeth[er] & made a grab to ketch them they sprung & got away from him one of the guards shot at him & he run all horses were then brought into the circle & the cannon prepared for firingbut seeing no more it was not fired travled 8 milesMay 15, 1847 ~ Saturday15th A vary cold North wind & rain we however travledabout 3 miles & camped in the best grass we had found on the road, most of our road this morning was over & through thebluffs as they come again bold to the river a large number of barefoot tracks was seen this morning under the bluff on thebank of the river, supposed to be the Indians that came down last night to steal our horses, the rain stoped in the afternoon & we drove 5 miles & camped on the prairie. distance 8 mileswe saw the bluffs dotted over with buffalo I went out with some others to hunt them I could not get within about 30 rods of them I shot at the neck of one & the ball went into his sholdier which crippled him but he hobbled away with the herd & I did not get him but there were a number of hunters among the herds & one of them killed a fat buffalo which was brought into camp. the bluffs again come down to the river a short distance before usMay 16, 1847 ~ Sunday[1]6th Sunday still cloudy & cool wind. I did not feel vary well this morning and did not rise untill 7 oclok which was two hours after the time when I got out of my carriage I found all five of my horses standing at the stakes whileall the other horses of the encampment had been feeding two hours. It was Br John Fowlers business to let themout but he did not get up untill half an hour after Idid. He Is destitute of the spirit or principle that a faithf-ul man or servant should possess and it makes it much harder upon me in the care of the teams & business than it would if I had a true & faithful manwith me Br Burnham does our cooking which keeps him vary busy & he has the hardest time of itas much of the time he has nothing but buffalo dung 
 to make a fire of we are now in a place whare we are proving ourselves & if we are not faithful we shall come undercondemnation. I rode out to day with Brothers Young Kimball, Benson Rockwell & Stephens 4 miles over the bluffsto pick out a road for the camp to go across to get again onthe bottoms we found a road through & returned to the camp I picked up a young hare which Br Young took in to camp, we saw herds of buffalo while coming in. Br Glines went out hunting & shot an antelope & one buffalothough it was against the rules of the camp & council of his captain to go hunting on Sunday. we had a goodmeeting in the afternoon Br I opened meeting by PrayerBrs Richards Markham Rockwood & Kimball spoke& the laws of the camp were read & a good spirit preva[iled] the channel of the teaching was to harken to council & sustain the Heads of the Church & go & do what was said unto us & it would prove a blessing unto us 8 miMay 17, 1847 ~ Monday17th It is much more warm & plesant to day than usual our roa[d]hads been hard to day we came 2 1/2 miles through sandy bluffs, we again struck the bottom 4 1/2 miles from our camping place but the bottom was much softer than usual & many slues to crosswe crossed about one dozen streams to day of vary clear water that come from springs in the bluff from 1 to 10 feet acrossthem which run almost on the top of the ground without any bank at all, with hard sand or gravel bottom, the water however was not as cold as spring water generally is, thehunters brought in 3 buffalo & it detained the camp some to get them in, President Young was not pleased with it aswe had so much meet in camp already & they went outwithout council. we saw vary large droves of deer to day in the bottoms the most we have ever seen any day on the road A young Fawn was picked up & brought into camp & keptwe travled in all to day 12 3/4 milesI led the camp mostly through the bluffs in the morning before Before Brothers Young & Kimball came up we rode together all day picking our roadsMay 18, 1847 ~ Tuesday18th The camp was called together or the captains of companies& President Young sharply reproved, the hunters for shootingso much meet when it was not needed & detaining the camp or for taking life any more than could be helepd and also the horsman for their indiferance in picking out theroad he said there was but two that had rode thant manifested any interest in helping him get the camp along. Hespoke vary sharply upon the indiferance of men, & they rejected the meet when it was brought into camp &cthe camp started out after the meet was disposed of& the hunters or horsman went forward to pick out the road instead of going hunting I did not hear a gun firedon the road during the day Amasa Lyman was one called by name & reproved for not paying any attention to seeking out the road, but he was with us to day in that businesswe rode 6 miles & cnooned we rode in the afternoon 9 3/4 miles & camped for the night distance of the day 15 3/4 m 
 May 19, 1847 ~ Wednesday19th we crossed the worse sand hill bluff of about one mile that we have crossed on the journey & what made it still worse the rain was pouring down upon us continually we travled about 1/2 mile on the flat & camped untill the rain was over for the time being we started again at 3 oclok but it soon began to rain again hard we travled untill 5 oclok & camped for the night on the bank of the river we travled 8 miles by the wheelometer 8 milesI rode forward during the day in the rain & picked out the road we had the most water fall during the day and evening that we have met with on the whole journeyMay 20, 1847 ~ Thursday20th we came 7 miles & camped for our nooning on the North side of the Platt opposite Ash Creek that comes through the bluffs to the Platt on the south side of the river whare theOrigon road first strikes the north fork of the Platt several of the brethren went over in a boat that we were taking with us & exhamined the rock bluffs, road, creek, &c & returned with some ash. rock, wild curands & cherry &c we cameon 8 3/4 miles & camped for the night we crossed a large creek about 12 rods across it which we supposed it to be a creek that Glos Cload called the Rawhiyde we had avary good road most of the day on the bank of the River, we have passed a good deal of rock bluff on both sides of the river, & some on the south side of the river was formed into natural terrices, rotundas, squairs &c 50 or 100 feet high looked liked good foundations to build forts & fortications & strong holds upon they resemble the work of art & look some like the old castlesof England & Scotland they were level on the top. A short distance above Ash Creek there is a beautiful ceder Island in the river which is a good beacon to show travelers whares the oregon road strikes the river. we have hada cool, windy, cloudy day whole distance 15 3/4 mBrother Egbert drove Br Pratts carriage tongue into the hind end of my carriage & broke in the end bord& the water came in when it rained so that it wet my again things & to day Br Fowler run his waggon intoit again to day but when I spoke to him about it he denyedit which caused some words between us. we had somelittle rain to day. The bluffs on the opposite side that I have described above are named Castle Bluffs & the stream that was called rawhide is called Castle CreekMay 21, 1847 ~ Friday21st Before we left the encampment Br Clayton put up a guide board with the following inscription for the benefit of the next camp from winter Quarters 409 miles from the Junction 93 1/4 ceder bluff 36 1/2 Ash Hollow 8 miles, & 133 from Fort Larameewe travled to day 7 1/2 miles & nooned in the afternoon 8 m& camped for the night. we saw 8 or 10 buffalo today buthave not seen but few for several days we saw some deer & antilope to day I killed a bagger with the jaw bone of a buffalo. Just as we got to a camping place two Indians came from the bluffs riding towards us & made signs for us to come to them several of the brethren went, it was a Sioux Indian & his wife they talked by signs awhile & went away distance of the day 15 1/2 miles 
 May 22, 1847 ~ Saturday22. The brethren found a part of a petrified leg bone of a Mamouthit was from the knee joint downward the piece was 17 inch long. 11 inches wide & weighed 27 lbs. we travled to day 7 1/2 miles & onooned & in the afternoon 8 miles & camped for the Sabbath, whole distance of the day 15 1/2 mour road has been vary strait to day but we came over 2 1/2 miles of the worst bluff sandy & hilly that we have past on the rout. we have also past several large creek beds of dry sand, the bluffs on our rout to day have presented the most singular natural senery that I ever beheld in my travels on the earth. It has the greatest appearance of the old walls & ruins of the castles of Europe from the size of chimneys to 100 feet square or more, bodies of earth & rock that appears as though it was formed out of clay stand erect scattering through the bluffs from 10 to 100 feet high, with perpendicular sides as strait as walls of a building while all the earth around them have been washed away to their base with rain & time. A spring of cold water was found in the top of one of these peaks apparently in a small basin of stone. there are considerable number of rattle snakes come out of these bluffs I sayw near a dozen to day a good share of the rout this afternoon the face of the earth is barren almost destitute of grassMay 23, 1847 ~ Sunday23rd ^Sunday^ In company with B Young & the Twelve we visited the top of two of the highest bluff ruins that lie opposite our encampment which were truly a curiosity. O. Pratt took a barometrical observation on the ownly tree which was red ceder on the top of the ruins or bluff which we visited we had a fair view of chimney rock from whare we were. I carried a bleached buffalo bulls head on to the top & wrote upon it with a pencil our names & distances from several places for the benefit of the next camp while Br Fairbanks [blank] was on one of these bluffs he was bit with a rattlesnake & became vary painful before he reached camp the Brethren commenced giving him such things as they thought best. And he soon was better. The camp met at half past 11 ooclok. E Snow addressed the Meeting & spoke well. President Young then addressed the camp in an Interesting manner, said he was satisfyed that the Lord was with us & Leading us had never seen a company of people more united than the camp had been thus far on the journey, that we should pluck the fruits of this mission to all Eternity that he had many things to teach us but could not do it ownly in a stake of Zion. But he was well satisfyed with himself, his brethren the Twelve & the camp at large one thing he would say to the praise of all, that was not one had refused to obey his council on the road. His peace with God was continually like a river & he felt that the spirit of peace rested upon the whole camp. many good things were said. Several other brethren followed him after which meeting was dismissed. we intended to have rode out in the evening, but we saw that a storm was gathering, & it soon began to blow vary hard about as much as we could do to save our waggons bows & covers from being smashed 
 the hard wind continued for about an hour then it commenced raining & which lasted about one hour accompanied with some hailit turned vary cold I had fears that some of our horses would perish with the cold as such changes were freequent in this region Mr Sarpee related a circumstance that transpired several years since at about this place on the 22nd of May one day earlier than this while travling down this fork of the plattit was warm weather the grass 10 inch high it began to rain some in the afternoon & turned cold in the evening & before morning 16 of his best horses were frozen to death by the side of the waggons & his boates boats froze into the Ice in the riverthe changes are vary great in this country & when I see it turning so cold I coverd all my horses with blankets that I coudld I got up several times in the night to see to thenIt rained occasionally in the night. the horses shook with cold but morning came & all was alive as soon as they were let loose they run to warm themselves.May 24, 1847 ~ Monday24th It was a cold morning yesterday morning the Thermometer stood at 52°, at noon 82, & this morning 38 accompanied with north wind, we travled 10 miles & nooned. I dreamed this mor-ning that some Indians came into camp in a friendly manner & stole 6 horses before our eyes & rode off we gave them chase on horsback & I awoke.As soon as we camped this noon two Indians came to the camp they were Siouxthey were well dressed & clean we gave them some dinner & showed them an Indian dog that had followed us several days but the dog would not follow them they soon left the camp. Chimney rock still grows plainer to our viewwe drove in the afternoon 6 1/2 miles & camped near the quick sand mountain that run in a ridge from the river back that apparently had been heaped up by the wind I rode about two miles forward to find grass and a camping place and on my return I saw about 30 Soux Indians Plunge their horses Into the River on the opposite side & make towards us I rode with several others to the river & met them as they came out they shook hands with us, vary friendly, the Chief unfurled a large American Flag with the Eagle stars & stripes & presented me a Letter. It was written in french we however made it out, they were all well dressed the Chief was dressed in a military coat. the Brethren from Camp brought a white flag & stuck down by the side of theirsthey wanted to go into Camp we proposed for 5 of them to go & the rest to remain in Camp but they all wiched to come so we let them. we gave them supper theyremained about camp all night, but were good & stole nothing. distance of the day 16 1/2 —May 25, 1847 ~ Tuesday25th The Sioux are in camp this morning we gave them Breakfast they stayed with us untill we started some little traiding was done they were men women & children they crossed the river when we left & behaved well we drove 2 miles & dbated our horses, then drove untill 1 oclok & noonedthen drove untill 6 oclok & camped for the night distance 12 mI was unwell had the Rheumatism in shoulders & back & teeth akehad to keep the carriage I read Hastings account of Calafornia He tells some great stories about California & oregon we camped within about 4 mi[l]es of Chimney rock 
 May 26, 1847 ~ Wednesday26th we travled 6 1/4 miles & nooned in good grass about 2 miles above Chimney rock we travled in the afternoon 6 1/4 miles & camped for the night. The hunters brought in four Antelopewe passed much good grass to day. I rode to day with Br Kimball & Benson to look out the road I have during the last two days read Mr Hastings account of Oregon & upper Calafornia. He has greatly exhagerated the account of upper Calafornia.Just before camping at noon while travling on a smooth prairie an accurance took place which liked to have proven of seriousconsequence to our camp. An Indian Horse that was bought of theSioux ran away with a whi singletree to his heels & gave a trem-endious fright to the cows, oxen & horses that were attachedto the waggons and in an instant a dozen or more waggons were darting by each other like lightning & the horses & mules flying as it were over the ground some turned to the right & some to the left some run into other waggons, the horse & mule that Br Fowler was driving leaped with all spead, with BrLittle hold of the lines & Br Fowler hold of the bits they darted by my carriage like electricity & came within one inch of a collission with my wheels if they had locked we should have been a wreck another waggon followed by in the same manner with a pair of Mules & one yoke of cattle upon a keen run which would also have smashed my carriage if they had hit it but my own horses by this time started to run but was soonheld up by the driver, Br Fowlers waggon continued to roollregardless of rough or smooth ground for about fifty rods & he draged the whole distance by the bit which was the case with many others, but all was soon stoped & returned to there lines without any accident to any team or waggon which appeared to me truly a miricle William Smoots teamrun away also with great speed. It give us sumthing of an Idea what an Indian yell would would do in such an encamp-ment with teams hitched to waggons. A person can hardly concieve of the power that is manifest in animals esspeciallymules when in such a fright. But I felt thankful that no accident happened.By an Imperfect measurment, by a Trigonometrical observationby the Sexton Professor Pratt made the Chimney rock to be 260 feetabove the level of the river. distance of the day 12 1/2 mMay 27, 1847 ~ Thursday27th we started 15 m before 8 oclok travled in a strait line 8 mile& nooned in good grass Br Kimball & myself picked the roadin the foornoon & it was left to me in the afternoon & I pilotedthe road in the afternoon as strait as any road that had been made on the whole rout & picked out a camping ground on the bank of the river in good feed we travled 5 3/4 miles 13 3/4It should be understood that we are piloting a road for the House of Israel to travel in for many years to cometherefore it requires the greater care. The hunters broughtin 5 Antilope to day. we camped at half past 4 oclockopposite Scotts Bluff at Lattitude 41º, 50', 52." the wedth of the river 772 yards a wind soon arose accompanied by thunder & lightning we had but little rain. 
 May 28, 1847 ~ Friday28th A cold rainy morning the camp concluded not to startuntill it stop raining. so we started at 10 oclok & travled 11 1/2 miles & camped for the night on the bank of the river it was a dampcold day we passed alongside of a clear strem of water with some beaver dams & houses upon it at one place it raised the water about two feet which was lined with fish a good share of which was speckled trout so the brethren informed me this is the first strea-m I have met with containing trout since I left the New England States. Therefore I name it trout creek it was not more than 3 miles long it arose from a large pure spring. it was but a little above Scotts Bluffs [FIGURE] distance of the day 11 1/2during the evening President Young called at my fire & seeing several of the brethering playing dominoes in a waggon nearby began to teach by saying that the devil was getting power over the camp that for several days past nearly the whole camp had drank into a spirit of card, checker, & domino playing & dancing & the spirit of folley & if they did not spedily repent their works, labours, & journey would be in vain that we should not accomplish the object for which we had come but shouldbe thwarted in it. He said the Camp did not quarel any to be shure for the devel would not set them to quarreling as long as he could draw them away gradually from duty & fill themwith nonsens & folley, for the devil was vary cuning in dra-wing away the people of God. I felt the force of his remarks& thought them necessary. during the evening I went in to the doctors waggon, read a chapter in the Book of Mormon& prayed with them. After which B Young H. C. Kimball W Richards E. T. Benson & W. Woodruff met in council in Br Youngs waggon & Br Young wrote some of theword of the Lord concerning the camp & expressed his views & feelings concerning the camp that they must spedily repent or they would be cursed, that they were forgetting their mission & he had rather travel with 10 righteous men who would keep the commandmentsof God than the whole camp while in a carless manner& forgetting God, we stayed untill 10 oclok & retired to restMay 29, 1847 ~ Saturday29th A cold rainy morning. At 10 oclok the horn was blown to gather up the horses & cattle which took more than an hours after which President Young called the camp together andrequired each Captain to seperate or calle out his men & when it was found all was present except two who had gone a hunting he then addressed them, sumthing in the followinglanguage, I think I will take for my text to preach my sermonfrom, I am about to revolt from travling with this campany further with the spirit they now possess, I had rather risk myself among the savages with ten men that are men of faith, men of mighty prayer men of God, than to be withthis whole camp when they forget God & turn there hearts to folley & wickedness, yea I had rather be alone, & I am now resolved not to go any further with the camp unless you will covenant to humble yourselves before the Lord & serve him & quit your folley & wickedness, for a week pastnearly the whole camp has been card playing, chequres& dominnoes, have occupied the attention of the brethren 
 & dancing, & Nigering & Hoeing down all has been the bet continually, now it is quite time to quit it, & there has been trials & law suits upon evry nonsensical thing & if these things are suffered to go on it will be but a short time befor you will be fighting knocking each other down & taking life & it is high time it was stoped, I do not want to hear any more such reportts as I herd last Sunday. of mens going to meeting & preaching to the rest after he had played cards untill meeting time, you are a putty set of men going to seek out a location among the mountains for a resting placeof the Saints, even the whole Church of God who have beendriven out from the gentiles & rejected of them and after you have esstablished a location you are then going out to preah the gospel, seal salvation upon the House of Israel, & gather the nations. How would you look if they should know your conduct & ask you what did you do when you went to seek out Zion, & find a resting place for the Saints whare the Standard of the Kingdom of God could be reared & her banners unfurled for the nations to gather unto, dut you spend a good deal of your time in dancing pitching quare[l],Jumping wrastleing &c yes, yes, did you play cards, dice checkers & dominoes O! yes, what could you do with you-rself, why you would shrink from the glance of the yeyes of God Angels & men even wicked men, then are you not ashamed of yourselves for practicing these thingsyes you are & you must quit it. After speaking sumwhat lengthy upon these matters he called the Twelve together the High priest, Seventies & Elders, & found to be 8 of the quorum of the Twelve. 18 High Priest. 80 Seventies & 8 Elders after which President Young said unto the Twelve If you are willing to humble yourselves before the Lord & covenant to do right & walk humble before him, make it manifest by raising the right handwhen each one raised their hand, the same question was put to the High Priest, Seventies, Elders & Members & all universally covenanted with uplifted hand to humble themselves before the Lord repent of their sins & keep his commandments. President Young then spoke of those who was not in the Church as there were sum present that they would be protected in their rights but they must not introduce wickedness in the Camp for it would not be sufferd. He then spoke of the standard & ensign that would be reared in Zion, to govern the Kingdom of God [FIGURE] and the nations of the earth for evry nation would bow the knea & evry tongue confess that JESUS was the Christ and this will be the standard. The Kingdom of God & his Laws & Judgment in {the hands of his servants Ahman Christ} And on the standard would be a flag of evry nation under heaven so their would be an invitation to all Nations under heaven to come unto Zion, the Saints would have to keep the Celestial law, and all nations & religions would have to bow the knee to God and accknowledge that Jesus was the Christ, but they would not be under the necessity of being baptized or embracing the Gospel of Christ, but they must acknowledge the right & reign of Christ 
 then if they felt disposed to reject the gospel & be damned they had a right to, & the Saints or inhabitants of Zion had no right to takefrom them their religion or persecute them on account of it or trample upon their rights any way, neither should other nations or religions trample upon the rights & privileges of the Saints who serve & obey the Lord of [and] Keep his Commandments neither would that be suffered as it has been in times past. And upon this principle all men or religions may dwell with us in peace, if they will keep the outward laws of the kingdom of [God] so as to acknowledg his name & his right to reign & let us keep the law of the gospel & obey his commandments undisturbed. After making other rem-arks he left the meeting in the hands of the rest of the TwelveElder Kimball followed & remarked that what President Young said it was the word of the Lord unto him & was just as much binding upon him as though it was a written Revelation and it was just as much binding upon the whole camp as it was upon him & urged the Saints to give heed to the teachings that were given.O Pratt followed & said that if the Saints had leasure hours that they could spend them to much better advantage than playing Cards as there was a world of Knowledge to be obtained & evry leasure moment should be improved in storeing the mind with some sciensce or learning some good principle and acknowledged the teachings we had recieved to be of the LordW. Woodruff arose & said he had some things in his heart he wished to say, that a burned child dreaded the fire. He had not forgotton his journey in the Camp of 1834 and should he live to the age of Matheusala he should not forget the hour when the Prophet & Seer Joseph Smith stood upon the waggon wheel & addressed that Camp & said that because they had not harkened to his Councel but disobeyed, & transgressed from time to time, that the die was cast & Judgment must come that we should be visited by the destroying AngelsAnd so we were & more than twenty of our numbers fell by the stroke & we all suffered much in our feelingsAnd I pray the Lord I may not see another such a timeAnd I would now advise my brethren to be careful in keeping the Coven[an]t ywe have made lest by & by the word of the Lord come unto us as in the days of Joseph & we cannot escape his judgment. I would advise all the Brethren who have got cards to burn them up for also checkers & dominoes, for if you keep your covenants you have made you will have no time to use them & they will be useless lomber on your hands. if you keep them for your children they will ownly prove, a curse to them. And my prayer to God is thayt we all may be enabled to keep all our covenants with the Lord & each other I rejoice that the watchman upon the walls or in our mids are quick to comprehend & warn us of evil & reprove us when wrong that we may de saved & do the will of GodBr S. Markham arose confessed his sins for card playing on sunday before he went to preach & asked forgivness, then the camp dispersed to there waggons & we all started on our journeyBr G. A. Smith & myself went together to pilot out the roadwe travled 8 1/2 miles & camped for the night in good feed though the whole Country was vary barren that we had [page torn] [come] through. we passed today through layers of good 
 sand stone in the edge of the bluffs one large rock resembled the hull of a steemboat loaded with freight so I named it Stone Steem boat bluff. it commenced raining before we camped it was vary cold, distance of the day 8 1/2 mduring the evening Br B. Young went out with the Twelve & had PrayesMay 30, 1847 ~ Sunday30th Sunday we set this day apart for Prayer & fasting, in the morning I shaved & washed all over & anointed my head & put on clean clothing, read a chapter in the Book of Mormon& humbled myself before the Lord & poured out my soul in prayer before the Lord & his spirit desended upon me & I was blessed. I spent some time in writing my Journal. The camp had a Prayer meeting, in the morning & met again in public Meeting, President Young in company with the quorum of the Twelve & a few others went into the vally of the hills & according to the order of the Priesthood prayed in a circle & Porter & Br Carrington watched to see that no Indians come upon us, we had a good time, there was a heavy storm appeared but it mostly went around there was but little rain whare we were, we returned to our waggons & took some refreshment having eaten nothing during the day, soon the Son came out plain & plesant. In the evening I went out 2 miles with the quorum of the Twelve onto a high bluff & had a good views of the Black Hills also PrayersMay 31, 1847 ~ Monday31st There are many portions of this country vary barren we travel over several miles at a time of level prairie with little or no grass upon it in this ground we find great quantities of the Prickelly pair & they are an excellent plant to eat though coverd with thorns like needles which have to be carefully paired off with a knife & forkthey are quite delicious have a little tart but vary plesantwe had a plesant morning, our cattle was strayed so far it took about 2 hours to get them up & get ready for startingwe however started at 8 oclock & travled 9 1/2 miles & nooned on a green flat most of the ground through the day was vary barrengrass is again getting vary scarce Br Pratt took an observation, & found the Lattitude to be 42º 4' 30" we travled in the after-noon 7 1/4 miles & camped upon the bank of a creek about 15 or 20 miles below Laramie the hunters brought in one long tailed deer saw several Elk & Antilope but got none of them I went forward to pick out the road through the day I felt some unwell with teeth ake & canker in my mouth. distance of the day 16 3/4I would here mention that which belonged to the mornngs account that there was a crust of frost over the grass the Thermometer stood at 35, at 5 oclok, we passed to day a grove of large cotton wood but the Sioux had wintered in it & cut down the most of it for brows & wood, we are begining tocome to wood more plenty but the Camp has had much difficulty to obtain wood to cook with for the last weeks as we had neith[er] timber nor Buffalo chips. the men would follow the river bank all day & Islands to pick up any wood sticks barks or chips that might chanced to have lodged on the bank by the flood or that the Indians may have left, but it is now to be readily obtained it is supposed that the creek we camp on to night is the rawhide 
 June 1, 1847 ~ TuesdayJune 1st 1847 A fine pleasant morning, I had suffered much from the tooth ake of late, I went, before starting on the journeyto Luke Johnson a dentist & got my tooth part of it dug out is & broke of[f] & left the stump in my Jaw which pained me through the day we travled 6 miles & nooned whare we had but little feed, we travled in the afternoon [blank] miles & camped onthe bank of the platt opposite of Fort Laramie within 1 1/2 miles of the fort. when we arived we saw some men approaching us from the fort when they arived on thebank we found them to be a part of the company of the Missisippi Brethren who had been to Pueblo through the winter, Brother Crow & his family 7 waggons & 14 souls were the individuals who were at the fort they soon stood upon the bank of the river we lanced [launched] our boat & crossed the stream to themseveral of the brethren went over to them among whom was Br Brown that led up the same company to this place last year, they were truly gladto meet, No one can imagin the joy of friends on meeting each other under such circumstances away from the abodes of whitemen whare they are ownly visited by Savages. Br Crow came across & met in Council with us. And informed us that the remainder of the Missippi company with the portion of the Mormon Battalion that was at Pueblo would start for Laramie about the first of June& follow our trail onto Calafornia. He informed us of 4 of the breth-ren who had died one of which was Arnold Stephens, had herd nothing of the main body of the Battlion. He soon returned home & the camp met together, President Young suggested the propriety of our leaving all our plows at the fort except such as we should want to use immediately when we got there, to do up our Black-smithing, Burning Coal, mending waggons &c as soon as possible so that we could go on our Journey as spedily as possible, acompany was appointed to do herding & to attend to all these branchesof business, we then retired to rest I am quite unwell & have been for several days I have canker in the mouth, bleed at the noose, do not rest well nights distance of the day 12 mJune 2, 1847 ~ Wednesday2nd In company with the Twelve & others I crossed to the riverto visit the fort & those who inhabit it we exhamined fort St John which is now evacuated but the walls are standing the diment-ions of St John are 144 by 132 outside, the Inside of the fort contained 16 rooms, 7 rooms on the North west & 7 on the Southeast one on the South, the largest on the north 98 feet long 47 widethe Oregon trail runs one rod from the S.W. cornor of the fortwe next visited Fort Larimie now occupied by 38 personsFrench mostly, who have Married the Sioux Mr Burdow is the superinteder this fort is 168 by 116 outside, theer are 6 roomsupon two sides, & 3 rooms upon the north & 3 upon the south uccopied by stores blacksmith & dwellings it is quite a plesant situation for a fort. Mr Burdow was a, Frenchman and a Gentleman. He recieved us kindly and invited us into a large setting room on the north side of the Fort, elevated about 10 feet from the ground, a flight of stairs leading to it gave us any information he could in relation to our rout. Also fur-nished us with his flat boat on reasonable terms to assist us in ferrying the Platt. He informed us that Gov Boogs & his men had much to say against the mormons & cautioned him to take care of his horses cattle &c lest we should steal them[page torn] [to prej] gudice him against us all he could he said 
 that Boggs company was quarrelling all the time & most of the company had deserted him. He finally told Boggs & co that let the Mormons be as bad as they would they could not be any wors than he & his men were. He had a number ofSoux women & children around him while we were thereAbout 20 of the Sioux men, women & children came with Peltry to the trading House. Provisions of all kinds were vary high & goods at the store flour 25 cts a pound tobacco$1.50 cts per lb. After conversing with him for a length of time we got into the flat boat about 20 of us & went down the Laramie fork to its mouth about 2 miles, & up the platt half a mile to our camp. After dinner we met in council & there decided that Azama Ameza Lyman go to Pueblo with several otherbrethren to meet the detachment of the Battalion that was therefor them to come as soon as convenient to Laramie & follow our trail to Calafornia. I finished the letters to send to Bevien & Ferguson I picked some greens & had a good dinner of then though I am not well to dayJune 3, 1847 ~ Thursday3rd A vary winday day we commenced before sun ris to ferry over our boats my ten was the first that went over the wind was favorable we saw 3 men arive on pack horses last evening at the fort on the oregon road we ascertained this morning they were from St Josepheth they report 2000 waggons on the road to Oregon from St Joes they are divided into companies of 20to 50 waggons & that they will arive here tomorrow the first coMr Burdow called down to see us cross today. we set up our Blacksmiths shops in the old fort to do our work. & made fires to do our washing Br Burnham done my washing to day the fisrtst time I have washed my clothing since I left winter quarters. Br Frost set 6 shoes for me today & 2 for Br Smoot. In the eveningI walked up onto the highest peak around us, in company with the Twelve & others we took a vew of the surroundingcountry on our return to the camp we visited the Indian & French burying ground the Indians were laid up upon a staging about 10 feet from the ground, the French were buried in the ground strong pickets around with a cross at the head being Catholics, snow was discovered upon themountains through glassesJune 4, 1847 ~ Friday4th [FIGURES] I wrote two letters to day one to Mrs W.& one to Aphek Woodruff A. O. Smoot & J Benbow & left them in the hands of Mr [blank] who keeps the store & acks [acts] as post Maste[r]s. He appeared vary friendly said he would for ward our letters that wer[e]sto go to winter Quarters to the care of Mr Sarpee & those that were to be deliverd to the Mormon Camp would deliver them to the leader of the Camp on our arival. He trulymanifested much friendship towards us. Professor Pratt took observations at the fort for the Longitude at the fort.I conversed with a mountaineer who had wintered at the great Basin of the Salt & Eutau lakes & he recommendsthe country vary highly for a healthy fertile countrythe Lakes & streams abounding with trout & other fish 
 A good supply of shugar maple & other timber before we left. Br Clayton erected a guide board on the north side of the river containing the following information which he took from his journals on the distances which was correct as it was obtained from the wheelometer543 1/4 miles from Winter Quarters 227 1/2 miles from the Junction of the Platt. 142 1/4 miles from Ash Hollow 70 1/4 miles from Chimney Rock and 50 1/2 from Scotts Bluff.we left the Fort & started on our Journey we took the right hand road up up the platt & travled 8 1/4 miles & camped for the night, the travel now appears to be attended with a good deal of interest as we begin to ascend the black Hills which are universally coverd with pine & ceder we saw one vary high peak coverd the top with snow Br Robert Crow joined us which added to our company 9 men 5 women 3 children 6 waggons 13 yoke of oxen 20 cows 3 bulls 10 young cattle and horses which makes in the whole Camp 148 men, 8 women, 5 children, 79 waggons 96 horses 51 Mules, 90 oxen, 43 cows 3 bulls 9 calves, 16 dogs and 16 chickinsI was in great pain in the afternoon & night with the nervous head & teeth ake 8 1/2June 5, 1847 ~ Saturday5th we have freequent slight showers yesterday & today while among the hills I was sum better today we had quite a rough road todaywe travled up & down the hills untill we arived at what is called the warm spring which is at the fork of the two roads that comes from Laramie we here nooned & visited the head of the spring which was quite warm for drinking waterIt boiled out of the bluff & made a little rivulet about 4 feet wide & 3 inches deep it was clear soft water but no warmer than I have freequently found water in rivulets exposed to the sun the bluffs, peaks, & hills begin to be more lofty as we got into the hills we are begining to come to an elk, bear & mountain sheep country, we saw their signs to day we came in the foornoon 6 1/2 miles making 15 miles from Laramie to the springs soon after we arived the first company of Moissouri emigrants came up 12 waggons of them. Professor Pratt took an observation for the Lattitude at the head of the warm spring & found it to be 42º 15' 6" we travled in the afternoon 10 1/2 miles & camped on the west side of a small pure stream of water in good feedthe Missouri company camped 1/4 of a mile below us on the same stream, they started this morning from the fort & took the South road which is 5 miles nearer than the North road which we took & a much better road. distance of the day 17 milesJune 6, 1847 ~ Sunday6th Sunday this day was also devoted to prayer & fasting, the Missouri company that camped near us started on this morningI am still troubled with the teeth ake. the camp met for a prayer meeting at 8 oclok the spirit of the Lord was with the people, the Camp also met for a preaching meeting at 11 oclok we had a shower of rain & the meeting closed another company of Mo waggons of 20 passed us it soon cleared off & the camped moved forward 5 miles & camped for the night on Bitter CCreek whare the road leaves the creek for the hills we campedbetween between the two Mo encampments one each side of [page torn] waggons in one & 20 in the other and a plenty of grass 5 [m] 
 June 7, 1847 ~ Monday7th The two companies started out before us this morningwe travled 7 3/4 miles & nooned on a small creek which scarsly afforded water for our stock & but little grass, while here another Mo company of 13 waggons passed us we were in fair view of Laramie Peak with its top coverd with snow,I found an abundance of sweet thisaly in the bitter creek bottom whare we camped last night much of the shrubery which we past to day was the black currand & goosburywe travled this afternoon 5 1/4 miles & camped for the night on the Horse shoe Creek in the most splendid feed we have met with on the journey the other three companies went aheadHors shoe Creek is heavily timbered with cotton wood Ash & willow it is quite a large Stream I went to fishing with a hook & line to see if I could not get some trout but I cought nothing, the Black Hills are a good deal timbered with pine. The Hunters brought in two black tailed deer & one antilope to night, distance of the day 13 milsProfessor Pratt took several barometrical observations at Larimie during 3 days & found the highth above the level of the sea to be 4090 feet, the Tattitude was 42º 12' 13". By a mean of six six sights with a good sextant the Longitude west from Greenwich was in time 6h 56m 47s.5 equal to 104º 11' 53" Lat. of the warm springs west of Laramie 42º 15' 6"June 8, 1847 ~ Tuesday8th we travled 6 3/4 miles & nooned upon a small creek with little water & fair grass we formed a company of men & went forward of the teams & cleaned the road of stone we used pick axes, bars, spades &c it was a great help to our week waggons the road was exceding hilly & mountaineous, in the afternoon we travled 8 3/4 over the most mountaineous road we have had on the routwe then deesended into a valley & camped for the night on Labont Creek with an abundance of timber water & good grass. we saw nothing of the Mo companiesBr John Higby went forward hunting & saw them when they started out, & they had such strife one with another in trying to start first they did not stop to milk their cows, & in clearing up their breakfast they stewed their meal, salt, bacon, short cake, Jonney cake beans & other things upon the ground through their encampment & when we came up 3 wolves were feeding upon the fragments I picked up a pocket knife & spoon left upon the ground.When we came over the high hills to day it was so cold it pierced us like winter when we reached the valley we found fires the companies in advanced had builtwe piled on the wood, soon got warm an antelope lay before us the hunters had brought in we carved it up with our knives & stuck it on sticks & roasted it on the fire & it satisfyed our appetites finely without saltSome traidere came into camp from the mountain on their way to the fort G A. Smith sent a letter by them back to the fort distance 15 1/2 mduring the evening we visited the traiders & got some information from the salt lake country which was flattering or good account was given of it 
 June 9, 1847 ~ Wednesay9th We started at 5 oclok & drove one mile into better feed& turned out our teams, the brethren traided some for robesmogacines, & skin shirts & pants with the Hunters who campednear us and at about 7 oclock 15 waggons of our party was chosento go forward to make a boat to ferry the Platt; they went forwardwe followed them, the traiders started at the same time soon anotherparty of traiders over took [us] who were direct from Santifee theyinformed us the Mormon Battalion was at Calafornia went inJan & that Capt Brown was in Santafee for money for the detachment & would come on as soon as possible we travled 11 1/4 miles& nooned in a valley without watter, in the afternoon we travled 8 miles & camped upon A'la'preel Creek when we rode upto the Creek we overtook our little pioneer company that we senton In the morning to built the boat, the Missouri company was alsoin sight notwithstanding their exhertion to get ahead of us, ourdetachment followed the Mo company how far they travled I knownot our Hunters killed two black tailed deer & one antilopeyesterday & an antilope today I am still troubled much with the teeth ake with the exception of this I feel vary well distance 19 1/4June 10, 1847 ~ Thursday10th In company with G. A. Smith I went forward to a largecreek 8 3/4 miles from our camping place Here we overtook the MoCompany they were about 4 miles from our camp we nooned uponthis creek, in the afternoon we reached the platt river & camped upon deer creek, 9 miles whole distance of the day 17 3/4I examined a splendid grind stone queyry on the east sideof the road as it leaves the hills & strikes the platt At was30 rods long above the ground & could readily be got at thegrit, was fine & nise the Hunters brought in two antilope, wehave good feed & our horses & cattle are gaining. In the after-noon Presidents Young & Kimball rode with us. our detac-hed company camped last night withe fore most company& we have not herd from them since. Br Carrington found a vary extensive coal bed in this creek one layerof about 10 feet thick another 5 feet length not knownbut was examined for 20 rods or more the specemins ofcoal produced wer excellent, the Twelve walked on to theriver bank examined the river, feed, &c had prayers& returned. At the blowing of the horn I did not feelmuch like retiring to bed so I walked 1/2 a mile from the camp on the bank of Deer Creek & found Br Claytonfishing with a hook. He had caught about two dozen goodfish. Another Br Harmon had caught some they resem-bled the eastern Herrin, they were about to leaves & they lefttheir lines for me to fish with so I sat down for half an hour musing alone as unconcerned as though I had beensitting upon the banks of Farmington river, vary suddenlyI herd a rustling in the bushes near me & for the first timetime the thought flashed across my mind, that I was ina country abounding with the griselly, bear wolves & India-ns, and was liable to be attacked by either of them ant anymoment & was half a mile from any company & had no weaponnot even enough to have defend myself against a badger& I thought wisdom dictated for me to return to camp so Itook up my polls & fish & walked leasurelly home & retiredto rest which closed the business of the day 
 June 11, 1847 ~ Friday11th we rode 9 miles & camped upon the Platt bottom for nooning, we travled in the afternoon 8 miles & camped uponthe bank of the Platt within a short distance of the Mo camp who were trying to ferry over their waggons, they reportedour camp to be at the ferry 10 miles or so above us, the hunters brought in 13 antelops. the Mo company had killed 3buffalo. A young antelope had hid behind a bunch of sageto keep out of the way of the hunters I discoverd him & crawldup & caught him in my hands but he gave such a spring he clearedhimself from me.we rode our horses into the river to dayseveral times to se[e] if we could find a fording place but we couldnot find any as the stream had risen by the melting snows ofthe mountains, we passed some snow to day on the highestpeaks distance of the day 17 mJune 12, 1847 ~ Saturday12th I started in the morning to go forward in companywith Br A. P. Rockwood who was riding President YoungStud when suddenly he sprung upon my horse butinstead of striking my horse he took my knee into hisJaw & bruised me considerable sunk one tooth to the bone through three thicknesses of clothing & one of them buck skin G A Smith & myself thenrode on to the ferrying ground & found our detachment ferryingover the Missouri Company they paid the Brethren$1.50 cts per each waggon & load, & paid in flour at $2.50per cwt, generally flour is considerd worth at the forts throughthis country at least $10 per cwt. It was difficult gettingover the river they carried the goods over in a boat &drew the waggons over by hand with ropses but when thecurant struck them they would freequently rool several times over in the watter & smash their bows out they alsocame near drowning their horses and one man would havebeen lost if the brethren had not picked him out with the boat, we saw also on the road whare the company hada run away of their teams a horse came runing among them& frightened their oxen and they all started to run tworun up onto a bank & turned both waggons over withwomen & children in & bruised them much, smashed jarscrockery, dishes, boxes & sundrys to peaces. one team runinto the river & would probably have drowned & lost allhad not a little boy jumped out beside the off ox whichfrightend him & he out run the other hawed off & runonto a sand bar he however kicked the boy against thewheel & the wheel knocked [him] down into the water whichhurt him, but the seene ended without any loss of life.The Blacksmiths had been to work for the Missouri Companygot flour money &c the company of 5 traiders had campednear the brethren. Our hunters had been busily engaged ingetting game, they had killed 5 fat buffalo 4 bear one old she bear & 3 cubs, & shot at 2 griselly bear but did notget them those killed were the black bear. saw a plenty ofantiope deer Elk & Mountain Sheep the mountains nearus abound with bear & other game I found some buffalo meatthe hunters were not agoing to save, so I cut out of the hump of a buffalo about 40 lbs of good fat stake & spread it to dry also tryed out about 8 lbs of good tallow 
 I visited the traiders camp they also was drying fine fat Buffalo, one of the bears feet that was killed measured 7 1/2 inches long 5 inch wide 2 1/2 inch thick two toe nails 2 3/4 inch long 3/4 inch wide. Our Hunters brought into camp 8 antilopethe camp came up & camped within one mile of the ferry ground in good feed had travled 11 1/4 miles 11 1/4 mJune 13, 1847 ~ Sunday13th Sunday A vary warm day the camp met for prayer meeting at 9 oclok. O. P. Rockwell, Brown, and another man were out all night hunting. One of the men of the camp started out at dark to go to the mountain to get some snowthe distance looked so short he said he could go & return before 8 oclok& was foolish enough to make a bet of one dollar upon it, but he did not get to the mountain by 8 oclok & about 10 oclok a company of hors-man was sent out with a bugle after him fearing the bears would eat him up.We had a meeting at 10 oclok H. C. Kimball addressed the meeting in an interesting manner, & was followed by Br Young who spoke upon the liberty of the gospel, showed what it done for us, saved us daily, exhaulted us to glory immortality & eternal life brought us evry good thing, but in doing this it did not do away with the law of God or the dictation of the Almighty Some thought they wanted their liberty to curse, swear, stray whare they were a mind to, run over the mountains, not regard the laws & rules of the Camp, but would that be liberty, not it would lead to death & not life, the man that left the camp & went to the mountains last night, had he have met a bear he would have had the liberty to have run for his cli life, clumb a tree or been destroyedThe way to worship God the most acceptable is to do each day the vary things that will bring the most good to the human familythere is a great differance to be seen between us as a camp & the Missouri companies that are going the same road or a part of the waythey curse & swear, rip & tare, & are a trying to swallow up the earth, but though they do not wish us to have a place on earth the earth will soon swallow them up & they will go to the land of forgetfulness, while the Saints if faithful though they should suffer some privations here will ultimately inherit the earth & increase in dominion power & glory untill the Lord shall say to them, go to now make your thousands of worlds & people them & make such laws to govern them as you are a mind to for I Know you have no disposition to make any laws but those that are good, for you always desired to do good on the earth, & many other goodly words did he say unto our edefycation. He was followed by O Pratt who exhorted us to give head to the teaching we had herd & to improve our time in treasuring up usful knowledge that we ought not to spend a moments time needlessly. Meeting dismissed and the Twelve, Colonels, Captains, &c of the Camp met at the Presidents waggon to consult upon what measures to adopt to get across the river it was finally agreed to go immedi-ately to the mountains with a waggon & team for evry two tens & get poolls & lash two or four waggons abrest to keep them from turning over & float them across the river with boats & ropes, so a company of horsmen started for the mountains & teams draw the polls. In the evening the flour meal & bacon was [page covered] [d]istributed through the Camp equally that had been recieved [page covered] [fr]om the Mo company for ferrying them over, it amounted to [page covered] 1/2 lbs of flour 2 lbs of meal & a small peace of bacon to each [page covered] [in]dividual in the Camp. It looked as much of a miricle to me 
 to see our flour & meal bags replenished in the midst of the black Hills as it did to have the Children of Israel fed with manna in the wilderness. But the Lord has truly been with us on this journey we have had peace & union in our midst, our horses & cattle have been wonderfully preserved from death & accident on the way & our waggons from breaking down. Great good will grow out of this mission if we are faithful in keeping the commandments of GodI have taken great delight of late in reading the book of Mormon seeing the great & glorious things revealed & recorded in that book & that we are now trying to fulfill the great things or some of them that Lehi Nephi Alma, Moroni, Isaiah and many other prophets had in view in the last days in building up Zion, redeeming Israel, warning the Nations & sealing salvation upon the meek of the earth & laying a foundation that the earth may be prepared for the coming of the Mesiah.June 14, 1847 ~ Monday14th At day light the two first tewo tens were called togethe to make arangments for crossing. The Proposal was made in the camp to lash 4 waggons together & float them but the curant was so strong many did not like that moad we appointed Br Grover as our Captain to direct the rafting over we finally con-cluded to put our polls into a raft carry our goods over in a boat & put our waggons onto a raft we commenced at 5 oclok & at 9 AM. being 4 hours we had landed eleven waggon loads of goods upon the North Shore with the little leather boat & during the day we got over all the waggons belonging to our tens being Eleven in all, and all of the rest encampment beingtwelve tens ownly got over the same number that we did that they floated therirs their waggons they floated their waggons by tying from two to four together but they turned clear over each other bottom side upwards & back again broke the bows covers & boxes to pieices & lost ploughs axes & Iron that was left in the boxes., most of our Company was in the water from morning to night & all was vary weary when the work was done, we saw a heavy storm approaching us, we had just drawn Dr Rich[ards]  two waggons to his goods on the shore & loaded them into his waggons with all speed Just got through as the storm struck us I sprung into my carriage & tied all down tight but the ra[in] wind & hail beat upon me so heavy that I had to lay out most of my strength to hold my waggon cover on both hail & rain came insid my carriage untill my bed & things were nearly drenchedit ownly lasted 7 minutes but was vary severe most of the wagg-ons & goods were more or less wet our horses run two or three miles in the storm when it was over I crossed the river & went after them, tied them up returned back & went to rest vary weary, but had some plesant dreams.June 15, 1847 ~ Tuesday15th It is vary windy to day & our companies cross the river vary slow. Another Missouri company has come up with us. I felt somewhat unwell to day with the exposers of yesterday & the te[eth] akeJune 16, 1847 ~ Sunday16th About 20 men went down the river to day & dug out two large canoes to cover over to make a ferry boat o◊tto ferry over the large companies of emegrants that have ariv[ed] & are on the way President Young thought it wisdom to to leave a number of the brethren here & keep a ferry untill our companies came up emegrants will pay for ferrying 
 $1.50 cts per waggon pay in flour, at cows, beans &c flour at $2.50 per cwt cows $10. the brethren also made two new rafts & got quite a number of our pioneer waggons over. I was quite unwell a part of the day with ague in the face I walked out however with O Prattabout 3 miles onto some of the bluffs to view the country we saw mountains to the North towering into the clouds, we judged they werenot much short of 100 miles from us. we had our guns with us & hunted some I shot one antelope cut his throat with a bullet & he fell dead in his tracts. Br Pratt shot at another but did not get him. this was the first antelope I ever Killed, I tried to back him in to camp but could not do it well so I got two men to help me. we had some heavy squals of wind & some rain in the afternoon. In the evening many of us went over the river to tie up our horses & when one company was coming back in theleather boat they filled it half full of water & came near sinkingJune 17, 1847 ~ Thursday17th Early this morning we swam our horses over the river, one mule came near drowning by being tangled in a rope but the curant carried him ashore & he made a live of it, the men went to work to finish their ferry boat while the men continued to cross waggons on the raft. All of our company got overto day & the brethren crossed some of the Missourians, Some of the emegrants report 1000 waggons between Laramie & this place & there companies are ariving daily at the fording places, Brs Young & Kimball gotover to day & we all moved our waggons once more into a circle. this is the 6th day since our arival to this place which is the longest hender-ance I ever saw at a ferry or crossing a river. Our brethren run the the ferry boat all night to cross the Missourians but did not getover but few waggons. I am still in much pain with the teet[h] ake & sore lips & mouth. I had the privlege of milking a Mo cow which gaveme a plenty of milk for Supper & breakfastJune 18, 1847 ~ Friday18th We are still ferrying over the gentiles. Another large companyarived to day. Bro Frosst mad me some nails & set two shoes for meon my Saddle Horse, we commenced gathering cattle at 10 oclok & harnessed but did not start at all, but turned our teams again, as all were not ready. We held a council in theafter noon & resolved to leave 9 men to tend the ferry to cross emegrant companies & also our brethren who should come after us, the men were chosen & wemet with them again in the evening, one Brother had petiti-oned to stay that President Young wished to go along with the com-pany his name was Glines he did not manifest a good spirit & Br Young reproved him. He then delivered a short lecturewhich was interesting & instructive, and said that when he gave a man council he did not want him to reject thatcouncil or to bring up many arguments to try to alter it for when a man did it I will turn on my heel & leave him. He sayes there is another principle that has tried many in the Church because more will follow me than some Young Elder whohas not proved himself but if he was to try to gather to himself the fruits of the labours of the Twelve & other men would that be right. No he would be pulling back that that [page covered] [w]as before him but let the Elders do as I have done & my[page covered] B[r]ethren the Twelve & other faithful men go and preach the [page covered] [g]ospel for years & do the will of God & you would have a train 
 following you even the fruits of your own labour & you would be putting them after you, & not drawing back that which is before you, the Lord is determined to esstablish his kingdom in the last days & He will have a faithful diligent & obedient people and He chastizes the Saints to keep them humble & make them do thereir duty if we had not been mobed & afflicted but always been in prosperity we should have been lifted up in the pride of our hearts & not gathered together & built up Zion as we ought to have done, so that these trials will work together for our good.Instructions was also given to the Brethren who were to tarry to keep to gether & be united, divide the means equally among yourselvesaccording to your labour, let each essteem his brother as himself. In no wise retain that which belongeth to the traveller, steal not at all, be careful of the lives & property of those you ferry over, & forget notyour prayers keep together & come up with the next company of SaintsThe following are the names Thomas Grover, John S. Higby, Luke Johnson, Wm Empy Edmond Elsworth, Benjamin F. Stewart, Francis Pomeroy, James Devonport, Appleton Harmon. Thomas Grover was appointed captainJune 19, 1847 ~ Saturday19th we parted with the brethren who were to attend the ferry & the camp moved on having been one week we travled through a barren country to willow springs ^a spring of water^ & nooned being 12 miles, wepast the red butes & many rough picturesque sceneries & camped at night by the poison waterstravled 9 1/2 miles in the afternoon whole distance 21 1/2Our camping place for the night was the most wretched of any ground we have found on the way President Young thought it might properly be called Hell gate. All the water tasted as though it run through a bed of salt, salts, saltpeter, sulpher the it was naucious horriblethe ground in the valleys & marshes was apparently one half of it composed of the saline floresance or salty substance of which this country abounds. Our horses & cattle being thirsty drank a little of the watter & quit it some of the cattle got badly miered in the marshes. The traiders informed us these grounds werspoison & would kill cattle but ours did not drink much or feed long we tied them up. The hunters brought in one buffalo & one deer & 3 antelopeJune 20, 1847 ~ Sunday19 20th Sunday we hitched up early in the morning without feedor watering & left our encampment of death, poison waters, salt marshes &c & rode 3 miles to a good camp ground & sweet water & turned out & bated 2 hours & took breakfast. this camp ground was on the willow spring branch about 3 miles from the head, President Young wished me to go on about 15 miles & look up a camp ground for the night, so I went forw[ar]dG. A. Smith went with me to the head of the willow springswe there found a doctor belonging to a Missouri company who had been doctoring a sick family in a company that was forward. He was of opinion that the willow springs were still 10 miles ahead which was incorrect as he was then sitting at the head of them. Br Smith stoped with the dDr to wait for our waggons to come up & I rode on aloneAfter travling several miles Br John Brown came up with me & we rode on together over a sandy barren, sage country to a creek of good water containing some small fish about 10 miles west of the willow springs we arived here 
 at half past 1 oclok we turned out our horses to bait & tarried untill 4 oclok watching for our company to come in sight, but we could see no waggons but saw two horsman approaching us, we waved a small flag for them to come to us supposed they were some of our company, but they were two hunters Capt Smith & another man from the Mo company carrying in buffalo meat to there camp they thought we were Indians in the distance & made off. I mounted my horse & put after them & soon overtook them, and made inquiries about our campthey said they had not seen it, but had seen a company of about a dozen waggons coming by themselves, I then concluded our camp had stoped at the willow Springs, so Captain Smith who was the leader of the Mo Company invited us to go on & camp with them for the night as they did not expect to go but a few miles further than the creek we were now on. As it was 5 oclok & we could see 5 miles on the road back & no waggons in sight I concluded our company would not come on & if they should they would go no further than the creek so we accepted Capt Smith proposal & went on with him to spend the night with his camp dut insted of his going but little distance he continued on mile after mile & could neither find feed or water except the salt & alkalie ponds & lakes untill we struck the sweet water river at Indipendance Rock which is so noted in Freemonts Journal & other travellers which was about 12 miles west of the creek before spoken off their oxen had tiered out having travled about 27 miles & much of the road vary sandy & we had road about [FIGURE] 30 miles and was quite weary, the sweet water is truly sweet to man & beast after travling through so much ground coverd with salt, perlash, and alkilie water as is found on the way we turned out our horses in good feed got supper which was bacon, buffalo, corn bread, coffee Milk &c then lay down upon the ground & spent the night under a tent with the Missour-ians but did not rest well. I found a great differance between the Missouri emigrant companies & our own, for while the men, women & children were all cursing, swaring, quarelling, scolding finding fault with each other & other companies, there was nothing of the kind allowed or practiced in our own camp. But to return to our camp I will say at a late hour they came up to the Creek that we left back 12 miles, & grass being poor continued on 4 miles west of the creek & camped for the night they travled 20 miles while I travled 30 miles. 30 milesThe camp not finding me at the creek nor hearing from me at all felt some alarmed lest I was lost, or got into trouble with the Indians or some difficulty they blowed their bugle & watched for me untill midnight & finally fired there cannon while I was camped 10 miles from them not thinking that I was giving them any troubleJune 21, 1847 ~ Monday21st 1847 June [FIGURE] INDEPENDANCE ROCK I arose early this morning took breakfast and in company with Br Brown we rode clear around Independance Rock I should judge the distance to be about 3/4 of a mile, we exhamined the many names & lists of names of the trappers, traders, travellers, & emegrants which are painted upon those rocks nearly all the names were put on with read, Black, & yellow paint, some had washed out & defacedthe greatest number was put on within a few Years some of them were quite plaim of about 30 years standing nearly all the Comp[anies] 
 pass by put some of their names on the rock After going around and exhaminedng it we staked our horses and mounted the rock I went forward & gained the highest point of the South end of the Rock which containes the names. After exhamineing it I then went to the North end which is the highest part of the rock, here is an opening or cavern that would contain 30 or 40 persons and a rock stands on the highest peak of about 3 tons wait. we got upon this rock & offered up our prayers according to the order of the priesthood, we prayed earnestly for the blessings of God to rest upon President Young & his brethren the Twelve & all of the Pioneer Camp & the whole Camp of Israel & House of Israel, our wives & children, & relatives the Mormon Battalion, all the Churches abroad and that the Lord would hasten the time of the fulfillment of his prom-ises to Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Lehi, Nephi, Alma, & Moroni and all the sayings of the Lord of the Lord concerning the building up of Zions in the last days and avenging the blood of the Prophets and while offering up our prayers the spirit of the Lord desended upon us and we truly felt to rejoice & while we were attending to our prayers the Missou-rians was burying a woman a little distance from the rock by the name of Rachel Morgan 25 years of age being the third one of the family buried on the road they were supposed to be poisoned by cooking in new copper vesselsAfter surveying the rock what we wished we again desended to the ground. I was the first Latter Day Saint that ever went onto that Rock or offered up prayers according to the order of the Priesthood. We had a view of our camp from this rock and expected they would noon there so we mounted our horses & concluded to examine the country in the regions round about we rode to the North East about 5 miles went to the top of a high bluff and saw the camp in motion we then rode to the foot of the Mountain to the N.W. & followed under the foot of the mountain all of the way to the Devils gate through which the Sweet water runs, while taking this circuitous rout we passed a salt lake covering about 50 acres of Ground, we spent but few minutes at the Devils gate at this time & hurried on toback to the Rock as our camp had come up but before we could get to them they had camped half a mile east of the Rock I met Br Young going up to the Rock I related to him my travels since I left the campHe asked me to go back with him to the rock, so I told turned out my horse having rode all of 20 miles during the forenoon exhamining bare rugged rocks & barren grounds & salt ponds &c and I returned with President Young W. Richards G. A. Smith & others & we again ascended the rock together & spent about half an hour upon it & returned to camp mounted our horses & rode to the Devils gate which is the name of the channel through the Mountain through which the sweet waters run. It is 5 miles from Indipendance Rock & while approaching this place from the rock as is the case while approa[ch]-ing the foot of any mountain through this country a person is greatly decieved in the distance for while An object appears but a mile ahead of you you will have to ride 5 or 6 before you can reach itwe rode as far as we could into the gate hitched our horses & walked into about the centre of the cavern. This opening or Devils gate is 400 feet high perpendicular Rocks 120 feet wide & 50 rod's long & the water rushes through it with a roar, the rocks are compo[se]d [page worn] [of] coarse grey granite with a vein of black trap rock runing 
 through it we spent about half an hour visiting this place then had to back out & ride around it on the south side some of the footman walked over the top of it we camped for the night on the bank of  the sweet water about one mile west of the Devils gate the camp havingtravled during the day 15 1/4 miles and I 30 miles. Distance 15 1/4 m 30 miles A guide board was put up at the gate saying it was 175 1/4 miles from the Fort Laramie, & 50 1/4 from the ford22nd or ferry of the Platt RiverJune 22, 1847 ~ Tuesday22nd we travled 10 miles & nooned. Br Lorenzo Young broke an axeltreeof his waggon which detained the camp some, two more Missouri companies overtook us at noon, the camp started on & Brs Young, Benson Little & myself, went back to meet Lorenzo & help him get up his waggon & we were behind all the afternoon. A company that arived at noon informed us that a man was drowned at the ferry after we left in trying to swim his horses across & they had not found his body when they left, two men also got some alarmed at the Indipendance Rock by a large griselly bear they stoped to put their names on the Rock & the company left them they started to follow on, one manwas on foot & the other on a horse & were met in the road by a griselly bear who made a tract 10 inch long, they had no weapons not even a knifethe Bear sat up & looked at them a few moments & walked off & theycame along, the griselly bear are more apt to attact men than any other kind.We travled in the afternoon 10 3/4 miles & camped at the foot ofa mound about 200 feet high, on the bank of the Sweat waterBr Kimball & mysel went to the top of it & looked down upon the camp & it look heavenly. we offered up our prayers & the spirit of the Lord rested upon us we descended again to the camp the moon shonebeautiful. during the evening the brethren put in a new axeltree into Br Lorenzo' waggon. distance of the day 20 3/4 milesJune 23, 1847 ~ Wednesday23rd We travled in the forenoon 8 1/2 miles & nooned by the Sweet water with the mountains piled up near by us our road to day has been through a level, sandy, barren sage region for a mountain countrywe travled in the afternoon 8 1/2 miles & camped on the bank of the Sweetwater whare the road leaves it for about 20 miles across the sandy sage plains without water or feed, we had excellent grass for our camp at nightwe are in plain view of the Rocky Mountains at the pass & beyoundwe had a vary sandy draging road all day whole distance 17 milesJune 24, 1847 ~ Thursday24th We travled to day 5 miles & came to the frozen or Lee spring and stoped and exhamined it & found the spring to be strongly impregnated with sulpher so much so it could not be drank the water would boil upout of a peace of bog ground yet all around it it was so cold that afterremoving the turf about 6 inch a solid body of Ice was found about 18 inches thick some of it we cut up with axes & spades. near this was small ponds [page covered] [of] water salt & saltpeter & sulpher & peotash seemed to be in the body ofthe water, pure perlash was found in such quantities on the edges of these waters that the brethren gatherd pailfulls of it [to] raise bread withothers would fill their cups with salt so pure from other mixtures that they used it we travled from this place 12 3/4 miles & camped upon thebank of the Sweet water two days 18 miles from the foot of the pass[page covered] [3] companies camped near us to night, this is the last time we shall see the sweet water on this journey we did not bait to day but camped at 4 oclok whole distance of the day 17 3/4 milesBr Youngs team run away with a waggon I cought them by thebit just as they were about to plunge into the stream 
 Soon after we camped Br Holman was driving up the horses with his gon in his hand. He went to punch a horse with themusel of his gun the lock caught in his cloths & dischargedinto the best horse the best horse there was in camp owned by president Young called his John Horse. He lived a few hours& died there are many accidents happen in that way by caring loaded guns with caps upon their tubes.June 25, 1847 ~ Friday25th we travled 8 3/4 miles & nooned upon a branch of the sweet water in as good grass as we have had on the way early in the afternoo we began to ascend the highest & longest hill that we have passed over on the jou[r]neywe travled about 5 miles before [we] reached the top on theway up the brethren found snow banks 20 or 30 rods long from 5 to 10 feet deep about 1/4 of a mile from the road they brought some to me & I ate somethe road was vary rocky a part of the way over the hills. we passed by 3 Mo camps who had passed byus we travled in the afternoon 11 1/2 miles & camped for the night on a small branch of the sweet water the chain of the wind River mountain seemedquite near us & covered with vast quantities of snow & we are so near the top of the mountain& surrounded with snow that the air feels like winter whole distance of the day 20 1/4 miour teams fed upon white clover to night we are nearly at the head of the sweet waterJune 26, 1847 ~ Saturday26th We started this morning at 8 oclok & travled untill 1 ocl[ock] & nooned again on the branch of the Sweet much larger tha[n]original stream in consequence of the melting of the vast bod[y]of snow on the wind river range, & the hills that surround usthe watter run into many of our waggons; whare we camped at noon there was a large quantity of strabury vines in bloo[m]& white clover we travled in the forenoon 11 miles & in theafternoon 7 3/4 miles & camped again upon the branch of the sweet water that we nooned upon, we camped opposit the table rock & near the summit of the South pass or dividing ridge and I was quite asstonished at the road & countryto day considering that we were crossing what is called the south pass of the rocky mountains it was the best road we had for many days & had it not have been for the wind river range of mountains full in view on our right & thetabl coverd with eternal snow, & some snow banks 10 fe[et] deep by the side of the road as we passed along & the table rock on the left I should have thought myself travel[in]gover the beautiful prairies of Illinois & Missouri except the country was coverd with more sage that prairie grass the road for many miles & also the valley of or plain of beautiful grass lying North of table rock was perfectly strewn with vary handsom cornelian stones I sawmore in one hour this evening than I ever saw duringmy whole life either in the rude state or polished & set in breast pins in all the jewellers shops I ever saw in my travels in the world from the sice of a gooseegg to a pea. distance of the day 18 3/4. 
 Elders Kimball Pratt G. A. Smith & Brown continued on to take an observation with the Barrometer on the dividing ridge & they con-tinued on to the waters of the green river 7 miles from us that run into the pacific while we were on the Sweet water that runs into [t]he Atlantic; they supposed we should come on to them and as they did not return several of us mounted our horses to go in search of them soon after we started we met Br Kimball on his return after us. He informed us that the Brethren were camped with about one dozen men from Oregon on there way to the States & they would stay together over night[FIGURE]During our travels to day I walked most of the way with Profess-ors Pratt, & Carrington and our conversation turned upon the subject of the original formation of God, Angels, men, & Devils the begetting of Spirits in the eternal world, & who by, the beget-ing of children on the earth, the Death of men & children & the resurrection of all. Each one gave his views, opinions, & reasonings& many interesting remarks were truly made. And any person who should chance to read these lines I wish them to understand that the Ideas given upon these points were not given as doctrin but opi-nion untill sumthing better should present itself or be decided by revelation. One of the most important Items If true was pre-sented by Professor Pratt upon a subject that heretofore has ben entirely out of the reach of all mankind from the days of Adam to the present time as far as is revealed to us. It was upon the subjec of the original formation of the first God, we all admitted in the first place that which we believed to be an important truth ie the eternal duration of matter spirit, intelligence in some form or other we also agreeed in the opinion that Neither God nor man always had fromall eternity the same formation that they now have but did exhist in some form for if we admitted the fact that one being exhisted in the present form all might have exhisted in the same form as well asone, then the question arose how did God recieve his present formationthe answer given by Professor Pratt was sumthing in the following language. He sayes I t[h]row out my Ideas not as doctrin but for you to look at. you know when a Chemist goes to work to analize or try new experiments they often have to try many times before they get a thing perfect & take certain processes which are unnecessary and are afterward laid aside and pursue the most perfect course that can be obtained. It may reasonably have been the case with the first being formed which may be called God. As eternity was filled as it were with particles of intelligence who had there agency, two of these particles in process of time might have joined their interest together exchanged ideas & found by persueing this course that they gained double strength to what one particle of intelligence would have & afterwards were joined by other particles & continued untill they formed a combination or body though through a long process yet they had power over other intelligences in consequence of their combination, organization, & strength and in process of time this being body or God seeing the advantage of such an organization desires company or a companion and having some experiance goes to work & organizes other beings by prevailing intelligences to come togeth & may form sumthing better than at the firstand after trials of this kind & the moust perfect way sought ought it was found to be the most expeditious & best way to recieve there formations or bodies either spiritual or temporal through the womb 
 June 27, 1847 ~ SundayJune 27th 1847 Three years ago this day the Prophets Joseph and Hyrum Smith were martered. Though it was Sunday morning we harnessed up our teams & drove 6 miles to the place whare Brs Pratt & Smith camped in company with Mr Harris who has been a traider & trapper in the rocky mou-ntains & travled through Oregon & Calafornie 25 years we found him to be a man of much experience & knowledge & acquaintan[ce] with the Country. He brought a file of Oregon Papers & one Published by S Brannon of Calafornia many of us had much conversation with him about the Country He spoke unfavorable of the Salt Lake Country for a settlement butspoke of other places not far off that were good. He said we generally could go through the pass as late as November but should we get blocked in with snow we would wouldfind a small stream of water 4 or 5 miles from the Devils gate near Independance rock this stream is 5 miles west of the gate follow that up a short distance & it would lead to a road that crosses it to the west which would lead to a through a large plain following to the mountains whare there is but little snow when you come to the pass or hill get onto some of them & you will see a large bute leave it to the [blank] hand & follow down [blank]And it will lead into the openvalleys see * belowIt is 275 1/2 miles from fort Laramie to the South passAt 9 oclok this morning I passed the dividing ridge that seperates the dividing waters of the Atlantic and pacific we camped at noon on muddy creek the waters of which run into the green river & the pacific I drank its waters for the first time in mylife that I tasted of waters runing into the pacificwe had a warm dusty day I conversed considerably with Mr Harris about the country we camped at night upon dry sandy whole distance 15 1/4 mil* 3 miles above the gate look to the South you will see an open pass in the Mountains go through that & let your Course be west till you top the hill out of the great plain, then look to the south you will see a square bute leave that to the left go on & cross the green River then let your course be west to Bridgers Fort, (And I think) he said we should go by blacks forkJune 28, 1847 ~ Monday28th we parted with Major Harris after doing some traiding with him He promised to meet us again on bear River, we travled tolittle Sanday & nooned the stream was high, in the afternoon we travled 2 miles & met Mr Bridger of the fort on the way with two other men going to fort Laramie. He was expecting us & wasto have an interview with President Young & the Twelve and also we wished to have an interview with thehim. So we immediately turnedonto the creek we nooned on & camped for the night & Mr Bridger & his men camped with us, we met in council & spent some hours in conversations, we found him to have been a great traveller and a great knowledge of nearly all Oregon & Calafor[nia]  the Mountains, lakes, Rivers, Brooks, springs, valleys, mines, ores, &c & ie if what he told us was true. He knew of gold, silver, copper, lead, coal Iron, Sulpher & Salpeter, mines. He spoke more highly of the great 
 [page covered] [Basin]  for a settlement than Major Harris did, that it was his [page torn] & if this people settled in it he wanted to settle with them, there [page torn] but one thing that could operate against it becoming a great gra[in] [page torn] country & that would be frost. He did not know but the frost would effect the corn. He said there was a spring at the end of the Salt lake that produced both hot & cold fresh water, & hot & cold salt water out of the same hole or spring, & formed a large body of verdegreece below which the Indians get to paint skins, arrors &c. He informed us whare to find a mine of silver & lead ore on big timber Creek we conversed about a great variety of things. He said he was ashamed of the Maps of Freemont for he knew nothing about the countryownly the plain travled road, that he could correct all the maps that had been put out about the western world. He said if we wanted any of his services to let him know, the American fir Company had paid him $2000 dollars per year while in their employ. He spent the time conversing untill 10 oclok, we then retired to bed several of the brethren bought dressed deer skin shirts & pants of [him] then theywould swap an outside dress for one Hickory or Checked shirt.We had good grass & water & plenty of musketoes to night dis 15 1/2June 29, 1847 ~ Tuesday29th we parted this morning with Mr Bridger who remarked that it would not be prudent to bring a great population into the bason untill we ascertained whether grain would grow or not we travled on to big Sandy 8 miles & nooned it was a vary hot day, these streams are now up but during Summer they become entirely dry, we nooned two hours & then drove onto the bank of the Big Sandy 15 3/4 miles & camped for the night this campgroundis the last time we meet with Big Sandy 8 miles east of the ferry on green River the road to day, as has been the case through agreat portion of this country has been over a hot sandy desert with scearsly any green thing except the various species of the wild sage from 6 inches to 8 feet high with stocks from 1/4 of an inch to 4 inches in diameter we have to use it for firewood & it makes quite a good substitute. O. P. Rockwell & myself went forward to pick out a camp ground we was ahead about 6 miles of the camp when we found one which was the first place we could get grass for 15 miles from whare we nooned, it made the longest days journey we had made on the whole route. I returned to meet the c[amp] [page covered]about 4 miles & was informed that Br Fowler was vary sick & in my carriage I went back & met him & found him in great distress in his head, back, & bones through out. He complained bittrly of the jar of the waggon. And finally was out of his head & became wild. I did not get into camp untill near 9 oclok, I then commenced doctoring him with composition, tea, pills &c & he soon began to get better & had a comfortable nights rest distance of the day 23 3/4June 30, 1847 ~ Wednesday30th Br Fowler was some better this morning seemed to be threatned with the ague kept his bed & rode in the waggon, we travled 8 miles & camped upon the bank of the green river at the ferry & the afternoon was spent in building a raft as the river was high it could not be crossed ownly upon rafts or boats. It was 235 1/2 miles from the fort Laramie to the South pass of the rocky mountainsDuring the afternoon the arival of Elder Samuel S Brannan from the bay of San Francisco was anounced in camp, we were truly glad [to] [page covered]meet with him that we might hear from him & the Saints who w[ere] [page covered]with him. He gave us an account of there landing their travels & t[he] [page covered]present settlement which was 200 miles up the river from the b[ay] [page covered] 
 [page torn] [The]y were putting in wheat & preparing for us He had come all [page torn] [the] way with ownly two men to meet with us. the Saints were[page torn] [se]ttelled with & the Mormon Battalion was 400 miles from him[page torn] [H]e said Br Pratt was doing well. The inhabitants of one whole Island numbering 3000 had imbraced the faith he told us many inter-esting thigs & we were truly glad to see him distance of the day 8 mJuly 1, 1847 ~ ThursdayJULY 1st We tried this morning to swim our cattle over the river but had great difficulty in it. About 15 persons have been taken sick within a few days with fever ague &c which is said to be common to emegrants coming from the snowy mountains to the plains or valleys whare it is hot wether, Br Fowler is better to day some others of the sick are better some are worse. each division made a good raft yesterday & are lanched this morningBrother Brannon brought a file of his papers that he is publishing with him to camp & a letter to Br Fowler from his wife. He also informed us that Captain Sutter was vary friendly & wished us to come & settel near him. He informed us that he saw more timber on green River whare we now are than he had seen on his route since he left Calafornia He came through a par[t] of Oregon. We are now in Calafornia. We got over 10 waggons to day among others my own so we camped over night on the south bank of the green riverJuly 2, 1847 ~ Friday2nd Two rafts have been runing through the day & most of the waggons have been brought over we swam our horses & cattle over this morning though with some difficulty, we held a council in the afternoon with the Twelve & 4 men was appointed to return to meet the camp & pilo[te] them up, Br Brannan was with the council, we each one wrote our views concerning the council to be given to the campit is an exceding hot day, and both man & beast are much annoyed with musketoes. Several salmon trout were caught at the mouth of a slue on green river near the ferry one weighing 7 1/4 lbs. Several of the brethren gathered a quantity of salaratus from the salarat[us] bedes about 3 miles east of the indipendance rock near the road & thought it answered as good a purpose as the manufactured article for raising bread & family purposesJuly 3, 1847 ~ Saturday3rd A light sprinkle of rain, cool, cloudy & high winds, so they could not finish ferrying, the pilots are preparing to start back to meet the companies I wrote a letter by them to Aphek Woodruff A O. Sm[oot]  [FIGURE] and John Benbow, the wind laid & we finished ferrying in the evening & the whole camp moved 3 miles & camped A guide board was put up a mile from the ferry saying [FIGURE] 340 mile from Fort LaramieJuly 4, 1847 ~ SundaySunday Independance July 4th 1847 A meeting was held last evening & the 4 men were appointed as pilots to go back & meet the company were called upon to start this morning to go on their journey. I accompanied Presidents Young Kimball Richards & others to the ferry to put them across [page torn] [t]he river & when we arived at the river we saw 13 horsman [page torn] [o]n the opposite bank, with therir baggage on one of our rafts[page torn] [B]ut to our great joy who should they be bout our Brethren [page torn] [b]elonging to the Mormon Battalion who volunteered into the [page torn] [se]rvice of the U.S.A. one year ago this month & belonged to Capt 
 Browns Detachment who had been at Pueblo through the winterBr A Lyman who we sent unto them had reached them & infor-med them whare we are & the whole detachment of 140 of the brethren were within 7 days drive of us, we drew up the raft & crossed them all over but one who returned with our pilots to meet the companies when we met it was truly a harty greeting & shaking of hands. they accompanied us into camp and all were glad to meet, this small detachment had come on to mmeet some hors thieves who had stolen about a dozen horses from them they had overtaken them & got all but one He had goneon to Bridgers fort & they calculated to follow him & get their horse they spent the night in camp with us, among the names of those who died was Mervin Blanchard who drove team for me last summer. But I must stop writing the Musketoes have filled my carriage like a cloud and have fallen upon me as though they intende to devour me. I never saw that insect more troublesome than in certain places in this country several traiders passed by our camp just at nightJuly 5, 1847 ~ Monday5th we left the green river (which are the head waters of the Coloradoe,) & drove 20 miles & camped on blacks fork there is neit[h]-er food or water since we left the green river to this place but is similar to the last 200 miles. A sandy desert coverd with sage, but we find good grass on the Streams. most of the day was vary hot & dusty yet towards night we saw a hard shower of rain some wind towards the mountains a few drops reached us in this coun-try it rains about the mountains but not much in the valleys & plains. distance of the day 20 milesJuly 6, 1847 ~ Tuesday6th A warm windy dusty day, man & beast harnesses & waggons wereall coverd with dust we crossed black fork at 9 oclok, muddy fork at 10 & camped on the west side of Hams fork at 5 oclok we did not noon at all today whole distanc of the day 18 milesThe sick in camp are most universally getting better, the face of the country is the same to day as usual barren, sand & sage, with occasionally a sprinkling of flowers some vary beautiful, the country during the last weeks drive has appeared vary destitute of game none to be seen except occasionally an antilope one was killed yesterdayJuly 7, 1847 ~ Wednesday7th We crossed hams fork and drove to Fort Bridger & in the region of the fort before we got onto our camping ground we crossed more than a dozen trout brooks, the water run swift but clear, hard, cold, gravelly, bottoms. the brethren cought several brook trout the first I had seen since I left England the whole region of country all up & down these streams were covered with grass knee deep, 10 of the battalion found a hors thief at the fort who had assisted in stealing 10 of their horses they had got all but two, & the man said they had gone to Oregon. we saw about a dozen traiders lodges about the fort the fort was merly a small traiding post ore one duilding not large distance of the day 17 3/4 milesJuly 8, 1847 ~ Thursday8th [FIGURE] The calculation was to spend the day at the fort, as soon as I got my breakfast I riged up my trout rod that I had brought with me from Liverpool, fixed my reel, line, & artificial fly & went to one of the brooks close by camp to try my luck cetching trout, the men [page covered] [a]t the fort said there were but vary few trout in the streams, and [page covered] [a] good many of the brethren were already at the creeks with their rods [page covered] [&] lines triying their skill baiting with fresh meat & grass hoppers, but no one seemed to ketch any, I went & flung my fly onto the wat[er] 
 And it being the first time that I ever tried the artificial fly in America or ever saw it tried, I watched it as it floated upon the water with as much intens interest as Franklin did his kite when he tried to draw lightnigng from the skies. And as Franklin recieved great Joy when he saw electricity or lightning descend on his kite string in like manner was I highly gratifyed when I saw the nimble trout dart my fly hook himself & run away with the line but I soon worried him out & drew him to shore & I fished two or three hours includind morning & evening & I caught twelve in alland about one half of them would weigh abought 3/4 of a pound eachwhile all the rest of the camp did not ketch during the day 3 lbs of trought trout in all which was proof potsitive to methat the artificial fly is far the best thing now known to fish trout with. In the afternoon I went to Bridgers House & traid[ed] [page covered]off my flint lock rifle for four buffalo robes the robes were large & nice well tan[n]ed or dressed. He called the gun $20 & the robes $5 each, the articles generally at Bridgers fort were at leastone third or one half higher, than at any other traiding post in America that I ever saw. His robes were $5 buck skin shirts $6pants $6 dressed skins $3 &c while at fort hall, doe skins 50 ctBuck 75 Elk $1 Shirts & Pants $1.50, Robes $2, &cProfessor Pratt took observations at fort Bridger in Lat. 41º 19' 13"Highth above the sea 6665 feetJuly 9, 1847 ~ Friday9th I arose this morning quite unwell, felt threatend withthe camp fever, yet I mounted my horse and rode untill 10 oclok beforestarting however I was called upon to administer to Br Carter whowas taken with the fever there are new cases evry day in camp. I took to my bed at 10 oclok with distressing pain in my head, back, joints bones, marrow, & all through the system attended with cold chills & hot flashes through the body, and we travled 13 miles over as bad a road aswe had had on the journey, which makes it exceding painful to the sick, the day seemed excedind long to me when we stoped at night I took composition, cayenne and a dose of vegitable pills and I had a better nights rest than I expected distance of the day 13.July 10, 1847 ~ Saturday10th I felt quite feeble this morning but felt that my fever was brokewe travled up & down some of the steepest hills we have found on the journey & the longest, we passed through a valley 6 ", miles long grass knee deep strong mineral springs, any amount of copper, lead, & coal, & lime & great stone on each side of the valley it is an 18 mile drive without waterthat can be drank there are a number of springs in the valley but they run through mineral beds and are not good to drink, we campedfor the night 1 1/2 miles from bear River. by the best spring of water we had found on the route & a small stream near by. An Indian came from Bridgers fort & travled with us & camped with us for thenight, camp fires were discovered about 3 miles from our camp G.A.S & others went over to them, and found it to be Mr Miles Goodyier& several others with him some were from Calafornia going ba[c]k to the States.

It is a hot day, the report is we have a rougher road on ahead than any thing we have met with, the country is vary mountaineous rough & steep many of the springs we meet with on the way are saltish or mineral. The Stream we are on [is] [page covered]Ogdens fork. In the afternoon I waided the creek two miles & fished with the fly down to the mouth of the canion I cought 8 troutthere is none vaury large in this part of the stream 1/4 of a lb was as large as we caughtJuly 22, 1847 ~ Thursday22nd we travled 8 miles to day on Ogdens fork, ^webber river East Canyon Creek^ & camped on the creek whare the Pratts Pass leaves the fork for good & turnes to the westwe crossed the creek eleven times in going 8 miles & the worst 8 miles we have had on the journey.

One man turned over his ox waggon & smashed the top all to a reck there was two children in the waggon but they were not hurt. the last 6 miles was as bad as any thing we had found. Having travled 5 miles up hill & 6 down total 11 miles we nooned by a splendid spring in a small Birch grove, we saw more timber during this half days travel thain we had seen in a month, & the valley both ascending & descending was extremely fertile & coverd with vegitation even to the top of the hills. At the spring whare [we] [page covered]nooned we were met by Brothers Pack & Mathews from the forward camps they brought a letter to us, & informed us it was ownly 10 miles to the valley of the Salt Lak[e] or great basan & 14 to their camp they had explored the country as far as possible & had made choice of a spot to put in seeds they considered it the greatest grea[z]ing [page torn]country in the world but was destitute of timber as [far] [page torn] as they had been, several fine streams of fresh wa[ter] [page torn]putting through the valley.

 July 24, 1847 ~ Saturday[FIGURE] JULY 24th 1847 This is an important day in the History of my life and the History of the Church of JESUS CHRIST of Latter Day Saints. On this important day after trav[eling] from our encampment 6 miles through the deep ravene, valley, ending with the canion through last creek we came in full view of the great valley or Bason [of] the Salt Lake and land of promise held in reserve by the hand of GOD for a rest-ing place for the Saints upon which a portion of the Zion of GOD will be built, we gazed with wonder and admiration upon the vast rich fertile valley which lay for about 25 miles in length & 16 miles in wedth clothed with the heaviest garb of of green vegitation in the midst of which lay a large lake of salt water of [blank] miles in extent in which could be seen large Islands & mountains towering towards the clouds also the glorious valley abounding with the best fresh water springs rivlets creeks & brooks & rivers of various sizes all of which gave animation to the sporting trout & other fish while the waters were wending there way into the great salt lake; our hearts were surely made glad after a hard journey from Winter Quarters of 1200 miles through flats of Platt Rivers & steeps of the Black Hills & the Rocky mountains and burning sands of the eternal sage regions & willow swails & Rocky canions & stubs & stones, to gaze upon a valley of such vast extent entirely surrounded with a perfect chain of everlasting hills & mountains coverd with etrnal snow with there innumerale peaks like pyramids towering towards Heaven presenting at one view the grandest & most sublime scenery Probably that could be obtained on the globe. Thoughts of pleasing meditations ran in rapid succession through our minds while we contemplated that not many years that the House of GOD would stand upon the top of the Mountains while the valleys would be converted into orchard, vineyard, gardings & fields by the inhabitants of Zion & the Standard be unfurled for the nations to gather there toPresident Young expressed his full satisfaction in the appearanc of the valley as a resting place for the Saints & was amply repayed for his journey.After gazing awhile upon the scenery we travled across the table land into the valley 4 miles to the encampment of our Brethren who had arived 2 days beforeus, they had pitched there encampment upon the bank of two small streams of pure water & had commenced plowinghad broke about 5 acres of ground & commenced planting potatoes. As soon as we were formed in the encampment before I took my dinner having 1/2 a bushel of potatoes I repaired to the ploughed field & planted my potatoes hop^e^ing wi[th] [page torn]the blessings of God at least to save the seed for another year. The Brethren had damed up one of the creeks & dug a trench & by night nearly the whole ground was Irrigated with water we found the ground vary dry. towards evening in company with Brs. Kimball Smith & Benson I rode several miles up the creek into the mountain to look for timber inthe country &c there was a thunder shower & it rained nearly over the whole ^valley^ & also it rained some the fore part of the night we felt thankful for this as it was the general corectopinion th[at it] [page torn] did not rain in the valley during [summers] [page covered] distance 
 July 25, 1847 ~ SundayJuly 25 Sunday This is the first Sunday that the Latter Day Saintsever spent in the great ^salt Lake valley^ Utah Territory|bason. we washed shaved & cleaned up &met in the circle of the encampment. Meeting was opened by thebishops & G A Smith Preached ^the first sermon while standing upon the cannon^ an interesting discourse & was followedby H. C Kimball & E. T. Benson all of which spoke unto edificationAn intimission of 2 hours met again at 2 oclok the Bishops broak bread to the congregation. I then addressed the Brethren was followed by O Pratt & W Richards all of which expressed the gratitude of our hearts to our Heavenly Father for leading us to so goodly a land & exhorted the Brethren to harken to council do away with selfish-ness live humble & keep the commandments of God that we may prosper in the land, several other Brethren also expressed their feelings & there was one universal feeling of satisfaction thwith the valley, evry man that spoke upon the subject said they were joyfully disappointed that the whole appearance was altogether better throughout the valley than they had anticipated or evendreamed of. At the close of the meeting President Young though feble addressed for a few moments and Informed the brethren [FIGURE] they must not work on Sunday that they would loosefive times as much as they would gain by it & they must not hunt or fish on that day and there should not any man dwell among us who would not observe these roles they might go & dwell whare they pleased but should not dwell with usHe said that no man should buy any land that come here that he had no land to sell neither should he buy any but evry man should his land measured of to him for city & farming purposes what he could till & he might till it as he pleased but he shouldbe industrious & take care of it He also warned the Saints againstkeeping any thing that did not belong to them that if they followedthis course it would leek out & they would stink in the norstrilsof Jehovah Angels & the Saints & though they might live with the saints & die with them they would be damned at last & go toHell for they were thieves & nothing but burning through Hell would clens them. He remarked there would be a meeting evrySabbath in thatis place or whareever we stop. Council was also given to tie up our horses at nightJuly 26, 1847 ~ Monday26th Monday The camp in general was busily ingaged in plowing & planting corn & other seeds. ten men including the Twelve were appointed to go on an exploring expedition. I took President Young intomy carriage & travled two miles towards the mount^a^in & made choice ofa spot of ground for our garding with a small rivlet runing throug[h] it sufficient to irrigate it which I named guarding creek we thenreturned to camp & went North of the camp about 5 miles & we allwent unto the top of a high Peak in the edge of the mountain which we considerd a good place to raise an Ensign upon which we named ensign Peak or Hill. ^I was the first person that ascended this Hill^ Brother Young was vary weary in climing the Peak he being feble, we then desended to the flat — started north to visit some hot sulpher springs but we returned two miles to get a drink of coolwater & then went back 4 miles to the springs we found them vary warm but not hot, 3 or 4 of the springs ished [issued] green water & formed substance below that looked like verdigreese. After visiting them wereturned to camp quite weary. Brs Mathews & Brown returned to ca[mp]had crossed the valley in the Narrowest place opposite the camp to the mountain on the west found the valley about 2015 miles across passedover a river 4 miles from camp about 8 rods wide which we saw fr[om] 
 soil as on the east, we then turned our course & returned towardcamp we had to travel 20 miles across the vale to get to the ford of theUtah outlet we here stoped eat & drank & returned to camp quite wearyhaving travled during the day about 30 mileswe saw on the west side of the valley about 75 or 100 mountain goats, sheep, antilope &c in flocks playing about the hills & valley.[FIGURES] After we arived in camp President Young called a Council of the quorum of the Twelve there being present B Young H. C. Kimball, O. Pratt, W. Richards, W. Woodruff G. A. SmithA Lyman & E. T. Benson. we walked from the north camp to about the centre between the two creeks when Prest. Young waved his hands & said here is the forty acres for the Temple (we had conve-rsed upon the subject of the location for the Temple previous to this)& the city can be laid out perfectly square North & South, east & west. It was then moved & carried that the Temple lot contain 40 acres on the ground whare we stood. It was also moved & carried that the city be laid out into lots of 10 rods by 20 eachexclusive of the Streets & into blocks of 8 lots each, being 10 acres in each block & one acre & a quarter in each lot. It was also moved & carried that each street be laid out 8 rods wide & that there be a side walk on each side 20 feet wide & that each house be built in the centre of the lot 20 feet from the front line that there might be a uniformity through out the city & President Young remarked that he wished but one house built upon a lot & they being in the centre if they took fire they would not burn up their neighbors and if any man wants a Market to housit upon his own lot & not lay out publick grounds for markets & let every man cultivate his own lot & set out evry kind of fruit & shade trees & beautify the City. It was Moved & carried thatthere be four public squares of 10 acres each be laid of in various parts of the city for public grounds. This was in Lat 40º 45 44At 8 oclok the whole camp came together on the same ground & passed all of the above votes unanimously as they are recorded & when the business part of the meeting was closed President Young arose and addressed the assembly in a vary interesting mann[er]upon a variety of subjects. Previous to this the whole assembly voted that there be a committee to superintend the laying out the City & that the Twelve be that committee & that they manage the whole affair.President Young in his address to the Saints remarked that he was determined to have order in all things & righteousness should be practized in this land. That we had come here according to the direction & council of Br Joseph Smith before his death & that he would still have been alive if the Twelve had been in Nauvoo when he recrossed the riverfrom Nauvoo Montrose to Nauvoo. He spoke of the Saints being drivenfrom place to place, and said the ownly way Boggs, Clark, Lucas,Benton, & all the leaders of the mob could have been saved in the day of the Lord Jesus would have been to have come forward voluntari[ly]& let their heads been cut off & let their blood run upon the ground & gone up as a smokeing incens before the heavens as an atonement but now they will be eternally damned. Also said all the governors & Presidents of the U.S.A had rejected all our petitions from first to last, that when the Saints were driven from Illinois & perish as it were on the Prairies then President Polk sends for a draft of 500 men to go into the Army what for, that they might be wasted[page covered] be [wasting] & it was that [page covered] 
 entirely wasted away as a people, if the brethren had not gone they would have made war upon us & the Govr. of Mo would have been ordered not to have let us cross the Missouri & the raising of the Battalion was our temporal Salvation at the time & said Polk would be damned for this act & that he with many of the goverment men had a handin the death of Joseph & Hyram & that they should be damned for these things & if they ever sent any men to interfere with us here they shall have there throats cut & sent to Hell, and with uplifted hands to Heaven swore by the Gods of Eternity that he would never cease his exhertion while he lived to make every preperation & avenge the Blood of the Prophets & Saints, that he intended to have evryhole & corner from the Bay of Francisco to Hudson bay known to us and that our people would be connected with every tribe of Indians throughout America & that our people would yet take their squaws wash & dress them up teach them our language & learn them to labour & learn them the gospel of there forefathers & raise up children by them & teach the children & not many generations hence they will become a white & delightsome people & in no other way will it be done & that the time was nigh at hand when the gospel must go to that peop-le. He said he long spoken of giving a lecture to the females & when hegot time he intended to do it. He spoke of the duty orf man to his God that he should love him with all of his heart soul, mind, & strength serve & obey him, and that the woman in like manner ought to obey her husban[d] [page torn]& not to have a woman every time a man steped out be a watching him as uneasy as a fish out of water & as soon as he returns O whare have you been, & what have you been about, & why did you not get back before & many other things that was none of her business. Her business is to tak[e]care of her children keep herself clean & house & keep my close cleanInstead of that the husband asks whare is the Children the wife will say O dear I dont know I was so concerned about you I have not thoughtabout the Children, they are probably to some of the neighbors.He remarked that when we become settled here he intended to have a school for his own family & all others might do the same if they chose or join together and a tutor ought always to be with the children & not let them get out of their sight & when they get weary of runing about in the house & garding let the tutor go with them to the public walks & keep them out of the streets & see that they do not sware & take the nam[e] [page torn]of God in vain.He spoke upon the subject of raising children spiritstaking a tabernacle he said that every spirit was pure when it first enteredthe body, but many persons have been ruined in consequence of the Mother giving way to temptation & fretfulness while in the state of child-bearing and the Husband ought to be vary tender & kind to the woman while in that state and the Mothers mind ought to be excercised i[n] [page covered]good things during the whole time & be calm & composed that what ever temptation the mother should give way to would effect the Child in after life. many other principles was spoken of by President Young of interestJuly 29, 1847 ~ Thursday29th President Young with his brethren the Twelve & others mounted our horses & started to meet with the Battalion under the command of Captain Brown, we met with some of them about 4 miles from camp we were truly glad to meet with them we continued on up & soon met with Capts Brown, Higgins, Lieut Willis & the train following them we exhamined a good grind stone quiry while on the wa[y] [page covered]up I soon met with Br Bevin who went from my family into the Army there was about 140 of the Battalion and a company of about 100 of the Missippi saints that came with them from Pueblo being about 60 waggons in all 100 horses & Mules & 300 head of cattle 
 which added greatly to our numbers we had a Heavy shower of rain while we were in the canion which sent down the water in the creeks from the mountain's with a rush & roar like thunder resembling the opening of a flood gate the first rush of the water came down with a front 3 feet high, some of the waggons had tostop untill it fell which was but a short time the shower spread over a good share of the valley whare we were setled, we returned with the company at there head & march into camp with music, they took up there quarters between our two camps on the bank of the creek. While we have been exploring the camp has been busy in farming puting in potatoes, corn, beans, peas, buckwheat, & preparing a garding for garding seeds & will go to work to prepare a peace for turnips our garding to day was divided off as each [ten] had need, our distance of travel to day was 12 milesIn the evening Br Young with the Twelve walked up to the warm springs about 1 1/2 miles from the Temple Block we went in & bathedit was quite as warm as we could endure & be comfortable those springs are healthy for the sick & diseasedJuly 30, 1847 ~ Friday30th [FIGURE] We met in council this morning with the Twelve & Captain Brown, Higings, Willis & others & herd the statements of the officers concerning the Battalion & there situation representedcounsil was given by President Young to the Officers what course to persue. It seemed wisdom for Capt Brown & others to go to the Bay of San Francisco & report himself & men & the state they were in Br Brannan would go as there Pilot much conversation tookplace during council of interest, Dr Sanderson was spoken of who had been with the Battalion and it was believed he had tried to poison the Brethren to death, & that he would be rewarded for his crimesAfter the Council broke up we mounted our horses & rode northto the warm springs also visited the hot sulpher spring 4 miles from the Temple block it ishues out from under a rock a large fountain of water forms a pool about 2 rods square 5 feet deep is [h]ot [page torn] enough to cook an egg in few moments we could hold our fingers in it about 10 seconds. After viewing it a while we returnedto camp, I then visited the soldiers camp & also our planted ground I found some of our potatoes had rotted some was coming up our corn was up also beans I returned to camp & had a visit from Br Dexter Stillman. He wished to come into my family also Br James Bevin wished to returned again to my family as he was with me when he went into the Army.At 8 oclok All the camps met together & was addressed for more than an hour by President Young in an interesting manner clot[hed] with the spirit of God. He expressed his feelyings freely concerning the treatment of the government towards us in the same manner as he did on the eve of the 28th. He informed the Brethren that there going into the Armey proved our temporal salvation at the time forthe Governor of Mo had already recieved orders not to let our people pass the Mo river if we did not enlist, the goverment intend to diestroy us from off the face of the earth but through the blessing of God we are here and I thank my Heavenly father for it and He knew we should prevail Zion would arise the Judgments of God would be poured out the Blood of the Prophets would be ave[nged] & their cup would be filled double unto them. And if we were fait[h]ful we should yet have Brs Joseph & Hiram & many of the Sain[ts] in there resurrected bodies with us on earth & when we died s[hould] 
 not sleep but a little time but should come forth out of our gr[aves] [page covered]with bodies that no mob could kill. we were much edifyed wi[th] [page covered]all the remarks he made. the meeting opened with a shout of Hosannah to God & the Lamb repeated three times with its AmenBr Young said the Ancient of days was not as far off as many supposed. At the close of the meeting I returned to rest meditating u[pon] [page covered]what I had herd an appointment was made for the Battalion toprepare a bowery on the Morrow for our Sabbath Meetings. 8July 31, 1847 ~ Saturday31st Saturday I spent the morning in writing, the Battalion we[nt] [page covered]to work at the Bower, our camp sowing & planting.

The congregation of the Saints assemb[led] [page covered]under the Bower on the Temple lot at 10 oclok meeting openedby singing & prayer Br Kimball addressed the meeting for a while & expressed his feelings upon a variety of subjects af[ter] [page covered]which Br O Pratt preached a discourse upon the Propheciesof Isaiah & others concerning the building up of Zion in the la[st] [page covered]days & thought many of those prophesies alluded to us in our present position such as Zion should be a city sought & not forsa[ken] [page covered]& that the munition of rocks should be a defence unto themthe Lord sware that their corn & wine should no more be given to their enemies, & that the house of God should be built up[on] [page covered] the tops of the mountain &c he had the spirit of preachi[ng] [page covered]& we were all edifyed, when he closed Dr Richards read a letter from the commanding officer of the Battalion who had gone with them to the Pacific spoke in the highest term[s] [page covered]of praise of them in all their procedings. Also a letter from Captain Hunt on the 3rd of Feb was read. Br Kimb[all] [page covered]made some remarks concerning our traiding with the India[ns] [page covered]that we ought to harken to council & keep our amunitio[n] [page covered]& not trade with them at all at present the Indians left our encampment in the night & whether they stole any thing or not we do not yet know. Congregation came together aga[in] [page covered]at 2 oclok the Bishops broke bread to the congregation Dr Richa[rds] [page covered]read the revelation given at winter quarters & the whole [illegible] [page covered]

And all oxen that are to go back this season should start one week from tomorrow & various orther matters were attended a vote was taken to cease entirely traiding with the Indians & have no intercoursewith them at all. we also decided to form all the encampme[n]tsinto one. In the evening the Twelve met & decided for Br Bens[on]  [page covered]go back & meet the camp, & 3 others go with him to get the mail & [page covered] [b]ring word concerning them.August 2, 1847 ~ Monday2nd [FIGURES] Br Benson starts for the camp to day I wrote a letter toFather Woodruff by him we commenced to day to lay out the CityPlott commiencing with the Temple Block, we formed our whole encampment to day into one circle, on forming our temple block of 40 acres it was so large we held a council to see if it was not wisdomto reduce it one half the size several expressed their opinion upon the subject, G. A. Smith believed if we done it we should be sorry afterwards would rather enlarge than diminish it, Br Kimball though[t] [page covered]if we let it be as it was & set it out to shrubery we should not be sorry Br A Lyman said G. A. Smith had spoke his mind &all our minds seemed to run in about the same channel, the President said we could eisier diminish than enlarge it afterwar[d] [page covered]& finally decided to let it remain as it was, we also walked upon a peace of table land above east of the camp & took a view of the table city ground which presented a grand prospect toour view. In the evening I went to the warm sulpher springs& bathed with Dr Richards G. A. Smith & othersAugust 3, 1847 ~ Tuesday3rd Our ten sowed our buck wheat to day a little over one bushelon two acres, O Pratt one third, G. A. Smith one third, & W Woodruff one third, mine to be divided between A. O. Smoot Br Dewey & Aphek Woodruff. All the encampment are busiy to day in farming, laying out the city, preparing for making dobys lime &cI recieved of Br [blank] Case 19 lbs of Iron at 25 cts per lb $4.75I visited the farming grounds gardings &c & found things coming upwell such as corn, beans, potatoes &c I went in the evening to thewarm spring to bathe with Dr RichardsAugust 4, 1847 ~ Wednesday4th I met in council this morning with the Twelve to set upon case brought up by Br Gribble concerning improper conduct of one or two men with his wife there was contradictory testemony & the case was finally dismissed for the time being. we again met in council concerning the size of the temple squareit was finally considered we could not do justice to 40 acres to begin with & finally concluded to confine the Temple & gard[ing] to 10 acres. After council I rode with G. A. Smith to the mountai[n]to find some timber to put us up a small building for a Store House & men also commenced to day to prepare ground to commenced ma[king]Dobys for puting up a fort 
 August 5, 1847 ~ Thursday[5th] [page covered] [FIGURE] As we were under the necessity of returning soon & wanted some place to unload our goods that we had with us & those that were coming up we thought it best to go into the mountain & draw out logs & build us some cabins as the doby houses might not be ready Brs Young & Kimball had commenced drawing out logs for their build-ings Br G. A. Smith & myself concluded to join our effortts together & do what we could, so I took my ax this morning & in company with G. A. Smith went to the mountain about 6 miles we had sever-al men with us to assist in choping we found a grove of fir trees that we thought would answer well we had to make a road to it & bridges across the creek I some dreaded the job, for it was a hard one and I do not exercise the prudence that I ought when I take hold of hard labour but do more than is good for meI however commenced choping down trees & done much more work during the day than any other man on the groundwe choped drew out more logs more logs than to build one house 16 foot square & drew home to the fort 25 of them I blistered up my hands & was vary weary at night distance of the day 14 mAugust 6, 1847 ~ Friday6 I arose early this moring quite sore with my labour I went into the valley for my horses & we could not find them. some Indians had been camp this morning or rather in the night & left again & we supposed they had taken a drove of horses with them so we sent our horsman & drove in all the horses in the valley to see how many was gone, but much to our joy we found all of our horses was safe which increased our confidence in the Ind-ians that were around us, I had rode about 8 miles without a saddle which was wors than labour, we however got our teams together & started for the mountains with 5 teams, & 4 teams went also for Dr Richards to draw logs for him, I sadled my horse & took my ax, & went to the timber before them, & before they arived I cut 5 large fir trees & when the teams came up the men assisted to cut up the trees & draw them out & load them, & we laboured exceding hard all day & we drew home during the day 52 logs great & small, except one load that we left by the wayside untill morning, this made 77 logs in two days that we cut & drew home, in two days we got timber sufficient for two buildings each of us one but I had lab-oured so hard during the two days I could hardly stand upon my feet I went to my waggon & flung myself upon my bed to rest. I had not been on the bed but a short time before Br Kimball called upon me & informed me that the Twelve were going soon to the water to be baptized for the remission of their sins to set an example to the Church as the[y] would be called upon on Sunday morning to bye baptized by the Twelve for all those that wished, we considerd this a duty & privlege as we come into a glorious valley to locate & build a temple & build up Zion we felt like renewing our covenant before the Lord and each other.We soon repaired to the water & PresidentBrigham Young went down into the water & baptized all his Brethren the Twelve that were with him by burying them in the water He also confirmed us in the Church & sealed upon us our apostleship & all the keys, powers, & blessings belonging to that officeBr Heber C. Kimball baptized & confirmed President Brigham Young the following are the names of those present on this occasion B. Young H. C. Kimball O. Pratt W. Richards W. Woodruff G. A.

 August 7, 1847 ~ Saturday7th I arose this morning quite weary with my labours of yesterdayI spent the day mostly in assisting Br Fowler to start on a journey to the Bay of Francisco to get his family I made arangments with Capt Brown to furnish him with a horse to ride & put him up prov-isions to last him to fort Hall & there they would get supplys. In [FIGURE] In the afternoon the Twelve went onto the Temple Block & picked out there inheritances President Young took a block east of the temple & runing S.E. to settle his friends around him.

Young none others of the Twelve were present in the camp Br Benson had gone back to meet the camp & 3 of the quorum was in winter quarters.During the evening in companes with the Twelve I went to one of the pure streams of cold water that runs through the City & H C Kimball baptized 55 members of the camp for the remission of their sins who were confirmed under the hands of Presidents Young O Pratt, W Woodruff, A Lyman, & G. A. Smith B Young was mouth in confirming the greatest number of themAugust 8, 1847 ~ Sunday8th Sunday morning at 6 oclock the Bishops repaired with the Twelve [FIGURE] to the streams of water for the purpose of baptizing & confirming the whole camp who had not been since we came into the valleywe felt it our privilege to be baptized & to baptize the Camp of Israel for the remission of our sins & to renew our covenants before the Lord, Brothers Lewis, Godard, Everett Shumway Snow & H C Kimball baptized & the Twelve confirmed them there were 224 baptized & confirmed this morning 99 of which I confirmed with my own hands making 288 in all that have been baptized in the camp during the last 3 days. The camp assembled as usual at 10 oclok for meeting and was addressed as usual by H. C. Kimball who had the spirit of speaking unto edifycation I followed him and was never blessed with greater liberty of speach in addressing a congregation I was edifyed myself & those that herd. In the afternoon we met again & pertook of the sacrament Br Lorenzo Young addressed the people & was followed by Br Brigham Young who was feeble in health, he gave good council & we were edefyed, at the close of the meeting 110 men were called up to go onto the Doby yard 70 volunteered & they thought that woul[d] answer for a commencment. [FIGURE]The following are some of the remarks made by w, woodruff [in]his address to the Saints in the fore part of the day written by Th[omas] Bullock clerk. I have been much edifyed in the teaching giv[en] by Elder, ^Kimball^ & have reflected much since I came into this valley, con[cer]ning our situation, our calling, & the work that is required at ou[r] hands. And the words of one of the Apostles will apply well to [our] case "that when we have done the will of God we have need of patience that we may obtain the blessing's & though it tarry lo[ng] we should obtain it if we continued faithful" Of all people that ever lived we have the greatest reason to be fait[hful] 
 & exercise Patience & not be weary in well doing for we have the greatest work to perform & blessings promised accordingly.The day has come when the Lord has set his hand with full pur-pose of heart to esstablish his Kingdom on the earth, gather Israel build up Zion & Jerrusalem make an end of sin & cause all nations to bow the Knee & every tongue to confess tha[t] Jesus is the Lord & has a right to reign on the earth and ye are the people ye Elders of Israel & Latter Day Saints that are moved upon & called & chosen to do this work, who is sufficient for these things, & what manner of persons ought ye to be. I rejoice that I enjoy the society of so many of the Saints this day in this glorious valley which has not been pelluted by the ungodly gentiles & that I can speak with freedom without being trampled by wicked men. the difference in the society tbetween the Saints & the gentiles in the United States can ownly be contrasted betw-een Heaven & Hell in comparison for let an elder of this church start from New York & travel to Saint Louis & let the people know who he is & he would be in Hell all the time & there is a cause for this a Prophet Seer & Revelater. Patriarchs & Apostles have been raised up in there midst, the Church & kingdom of God has been planted among them, the gospel preached & salvation freely offered unto all & what have they done, they have stoned the Prophets & killed thempoured out their blood like water upon the earth, have burned their dwellings & given their goods to the flames, have driven the Apostles with the keys of Eternal life & salvation with the entire Church & kingdom of God out of their midst into the wilderness & the mountais yets they have turned the last key that has sealed & locked fast their condemnation that lingereth not & there damnation that slumbereth not. And this is the reason why they are full of hell & desire to destroy every thing that retainets any portion of the spirit of the spirit of God. But if it requires all the martered Saints in Heaven from Rig[h]teous Abel to Joseph to go forth from the temple in Heaven & [p]our out all the vials of the last plagues upon the United States & open the seals upon them in order to avenge the blood of the Prophets & Saints which they have spilt, it will be done for that blood shall spedily be avenged. Yea vary spedilyThe Prophet Joseph, The Twelve Apostles,, with many of the Elders of Israel & Saints have been called to pass through scenes of sufferings & privations, that would have discouraged an Allexander, they have had to combat earth and Hell, wicked men & devils, sickness & death, burnings Drivings & persecutions, but havewe ben discouraged no the greater the difficulties the more we have been stimulated to action, what has sustained us & inspired us to action in the midst of these difficulties. We have been upheld by the power of God that we might fulfill his purposes. Our spirits have been stired up by the spilt blood of the Martered Prophets which still cries from the ground [to] [page covered] heaven for vengance & will not rest neither let us untill it isavenged, we have also been moved upon by the spirits of our [f]athers [page covered] & Progenitors whose bodies have lain in the dust for many generatons, who recieved not the gospel in the flesh not having it[p]roffered [page covered] unto them, but are now waiting for the redemption of their bodies after salvation shall be sealed upon them through the instrumentality of their sons who should embrace the gospel in the fulness of times, we are also moved upon by the Holy Ghost to accomplish the great work of the last days & fulness of times in preparing the ear[th] [page torn] 
 for the reign of Christ, & to fulfill the promises which was madeto the Ancient Prophets & Patriarch which promises they drew from the Heavens by their faith & faithfulness before the Lord & saw the work that lies before us by the spirit of inspiration revelation dreams & the visions of Heaven. Thus it has been that a combination of causes of eternal & important consequence has stimulated the Proph[et] Apostles & Elders to action untill they have resolved in their hearts that for Zions sake they would not hold their peace & for Jerrusalem sake they would not rest, untill their righteousness goes forth as brightness & Salvation as a Lamp that burneth. Yea the time has come for the Lord to esstablish his kingdom on the earth & to make a short work of it& overthrow the Kingdom of the devel, for He has held dominion onthe earth for many generations & in one instance undertook to claim his right to all the Kingdoms of the world before the Lord wh[en]He showed the Savior all the kingdoms of the world & proffered to give them to him if He would fall down & worship him, when in fact the Poor Devil did did not own one foot of land on the earthI feel also that the time has come when we can no more preach salvation to those of the gentiles who have rejected the Prophets & killed them & cast the saints & the gospel out of their midst, the last time I wasthrough the United States I could not preach salvation to the people but I could have the spirit of God to preach damnation to them fo[r]they were worthy I tried to preach a gospel sermon in the Temple in Nauvoo to many of the world who were present but it was hard work to do it. But I could tell them about their spilling the blood of the Prophets & the judgments that must follow them& that they had not got done with Joseph Smith but he would yet r[ule] in judgment against them & condemn them.I will close by relating a circumstance that transpired when I was inthe eastern States on my return ofrom England I went to the State of Connecticut (my native place) to get my father to bring to Zion. Ithought if Joseph was justifyed in giving commandment to have hi[s] bones taken to be buried in Canaan, that I was justifyed In taking my living father & gathering him with the Saints & while at his housewas visited by my Fathers Sister Aunt Wheeler who was naturly a good woman & a strenuous Prysbeterian while conversing about our lea[ving] & going so far off she asked me with tears in her eyes if I suppo[sed]we could find any Christian society to associate with, I replyed forGods sake & our sake I hope not, she gazed at me with amazement& wondered why I should feel so, I replyed that the Christians of this generation in the United States had persecuted us to all intents & purposes had burned our dwellings, given our goods to the flames had murdered our Brethren, Sistiers, wives & children had marte[red] our Prophets, Patriarchs, & Apostles & driven the remainder of us from their midst & should we now desire their society & see[k] their religion? No I would rather be in the midst of the griselly b[ears]of the rocky mountains, or mingle with the society of the Savages [in]the forest, than to longer mingle with such Christians or longer bear the fruits of their religionAugust 9, 1847 ~ Monday9th I spent the day in making a saw pitAugust 10, 1847 ~ Tuesday10th I spent the day in preparing timber for our dwellings in the for[t]we decided by council to enclose one block of 10 acres with dobys & buildings as a fort or fortification.August 11, 1847 ~ Wednesday[11th] [page folded] I spent this day in framing timber the company also comm[enced][l]aying [page folded] their wall on one side of the lot one doby & a half thick 2 [1/2] 
 [gr]ace [page torn] for grace. when Brother Joseph received the Priesthood he did not recived all at once, but he was a prophet Seer & Revela[tor] [page torn]before he recieved the fulness of the Priesthood & keys of the kingd[om] [page torn]he first recieved the Aronick Priesthood & Keys from under the handof John the Baptisk. He then had not power to lay on hands to confirm the Church but afterwards he recieved the Patriarchal or Melchisidick Priesthood from under the hands of Peter James & John who were of the Twelve Apostles & were the Presidency when the other Apostl[es]were absent, from those Apostles Joseph Smith recieved every key [FIGURE]power, blessing, & Privilege of the highest authority of the Melchezedick Priesthood ever committed to man on the earth which they heldsome have had fears that we had not power to get revelations since the death of Joseph, but I want this subject from this time forth to be forever set at rest and I want this Church to understand from this day henceforth & forever that an apostle is the highest office & authority that there is in the Church & kingdom of God on the earth. from whom did Joseph recieve his authority from just such men as sit around me here (pointing to the Twelve Apostles that sat with him) Peter James & John were Apostles & there was no noise about their being seers & Revelators though those gifts were among them. Joseph Smith gave unto me & my brethr[en] the Twelve all the Priesthood keys Power & Authority which he ha[d] And those are powers which belong to the Apostleship. In Joseph[s] day we had to ordain Patriarchs could we ordain men to Author[ity] greater than we held ourselves No. But it is necessary to have Patria[rchs] to bless the People that they may have blessings by the spirit of prop[hecy] & Revelation sealed upon their heads & their posterity & know what awaits their posterity Father Smith was the Seignor Patriarch in the Church & first Patriarch in our day & afterwards Hiyram was th[e] seignor Patriarch for his father sealed it upon his head but was there Power & Authority different from all Patriarchs in the church No they were all alike in their authority in blessing. Elijah isspoken of in the Bible that he should come in the last days to sta turn the hearts of the fathers to the children & the children to their fathers, the fulfillment of this scripture is manifest in esstablishing the kingdom of God & Priesthood on the earth in the last days & those who hold the keys of the priesthood & sealing power have the spirit& power of Elijah & it is necessary in order to redeem our dead & save our children there is much more importance attached to this than Parents are aware of. In the loss of this child of Brother Crows that was drowned I felt that I could weep in sorrow if I gave way to my feeli[ngs] for I realize it is a loss to the parents to loose little children. it is true al[l] children are saved there names are written in the Lambs book of li[fe]which was the case with every spirit that takes a tabernacle on this earth. their names were written there before the world was made, & will there ever remain untill they sin against the Holy Gho[st] it will then be blotted out no more to be recorded forever. But notwithstanding this can brother Crow get that child again or any oth[er] person their children except their is sumthing done for them on the earth by their Parents, No they would not, they would go to God whogave them but the parents on the earth would not have them, the Parents framed the body to be sure but the Lord gave the spiritwhat is the body good for without the spirit. what then can [be] done, I will tell you a man that has embraced the gospel must [be] some one who has the Priesthood & keys & power of Elijah, & mu[st] [att]end to ordinances for that child, even must be baptized fo[r it][as well] as to have it sealed to him & through t[he] [2 illegible words] 
 [page torn] [Br] Crow had a young ^grand^ child drowned today. The child's name was ThirlkieAugust 12, 1847 ~ Thursday [page torn] [12th] Br Crows ^grand^ child was buried today.

Br Brigham Young took towo tier of blocks South through the City. Br Kimball run North & N west O Pratt 4 blocks W Woodruff 8 Blocks G A Smith 8, & A Lyman 12 blocks according to the company organized with them.August 14, 1847 ~ Saturday[1]4th I was quite unwell through the day & did not feel able to labour. 4 of the messengers returned from Bear River valley & cash valley who started with Capt Brown that has gone with a company to [t]he Bay via Fort Hall. The messengers bring a glorious report of [C]ash valley & the country between us & there, that is rich soil & well watered & well calculated for farming purposes also bear [r]iver valley for stock graizing &c called at Miles Goodyiers placehad about 30 yards picketed in a small garding corn & vegitation doing well. it was about 90 miles from the City of the Salt lake [t]o Cash valley & [blank] miles toor Bear River valley. our Brethren brought[i]n 4 loads of salt from the lake which was obtained with little [t]rouble as it lay in bars, banks, & beds in the edge of the water &[h]ad to be shoveld up, washed, dreaned, &c & was then prepared [f]or use. The Brethren also returned that went to the Utah lake to get[f]ish they could not get quite to the lake with a waggon without working the road some, & having no tools returned found a mount[a]in of granite good for building runing from 7 to 15 miles from CampThe quorum of the Twelve decided in Council that the name of [o]ur City should be TCity of the Salt Lake. Great Bason, North AmericaAugust 15, 1847 ~ Sunday[1]5th [FIGURES] Sunday The Camp of Israel met as usal at 10 oclok & was addressed by President Young in an interesting manner upon an interesting subject much to our edifycation. The following are some of the remarks made by President Young. I am going to day sto speak upon the subject of the Patriarchal Priesthood & by request of Br Crow say sumthing upon the death of his child that was drowned the other day. I hope to speak so as to be understoodThere is a reality in eternal things as much as in the things of time which we daily see with our eyes when a man has a dream or [v]ision of eternal things it is an evidence of its truth as much as [t]hough he saw it with his own eyes in one sens of the word. The Lord has hid from man the things that He knew before He [c]ame in the flesh that he might walk by faith & prove himself [w]hile here. The Lord converses with men on the earth in the [f]orm of a servent & by visions & dreams &c but He never appea[rs to] man in the flesh in the fulness of his glory, for He is as a [c]onsuming fire & a mortal body would perish in an instantThe Priesthood is again restored on the earth to bring back [illegible][w]hich [2 illegible words] we do not recieve all at once but [2 illegible words] 
 [page torn] [c]laim his child in the morning of the resurrection & the Lord will give it up to him. I had my children sealed to me in the [page torn] [t]emple except one that died & that I shall leave in the hands of [page torn] [t]he Lord, untill I have another opportunity. As soon as we get up some doby houses for our families we shall go to work to build another Temple & as soon as a place is prepared we shal[l] commence the Endowments long before the Temple is built & we shall take time, & each step the Saints take let them take time enough about it to understand it. evry thing at Nauvoo went with a rush we had to build the Temple with the trowel in one hand & the sword in the other & mobs were upon us all the while and many crying out O the temple cant be built, I told them it should be built, this Church should not fall & the Lord said if we did notbuild it we should be rejected as a Church with our dead why did He say it because the Saints were becoming slothful & covetous & would spend their means upon fine houses for themselves before they would put it into a House for the Lord. But we went at it & finished it & turned it over into the hands of the Lord in spite of earth & Hell & the Brethren was so faithful at it that we laboured day [and] night to give them their endowments. The Children want to be sealed to their Parents & Parents to their Children, that they may have blessings in eternity that they will stand in need of. God promised to Abraham that his seedshould be as numerous as the stars of Heaven & the sands of the seashore & to his seed there should be no end this of course would continue through all Eternity, the same blessing is upon our heads if we are faithful for our eyes have not seen, our ears herd neither entered into our hearts the great things that God has in store for us. & when I look upon the great work the Elders of Israel have to perform & lookaround upon them & see them vain & foolish, it makes me sorrowfulthey forget their Calling. O ye Elders of Israel think for a moment what manner of persons ought ye to be, men who hold the priesthood & keys of salvation & have power to go to the Nations of the Earth & & say Here Gentleman & Ladies I have salvation for you & power to exhalt you to Celestial Glory, or if you reject it to seal you unto damnationit is no trifling affair to have power put into your hand to deal with [t]he Eternal destinies of the sons & daughters of Adam that form the Nations of the earth. While in the Temple at Nauvoo we voted to cut off the gentiles who had rejected the gospel & killed the prophets& it was recorded on earth & if it is recorded in heaven that Nation wi[ll] go down quickly. Many other interesting & important items were presented by President Young much to our edifycation. meeting was dismissed & met again at 2 oclok & was addressed in a vary edifying manner by O Pratt, & treated upon the same principles spoken off by Br Young. Among his remarks he said, that as all the ordinances of the gospel administered by the world since the Aposticy of the Church was illegal, in like manner was the marriage cerimony illegal and all the world who had been begotton through the illegal marriage, were bastards & not sons & hence they had to enter into the law of adopti[on] [ink spot]& be adopted into the Priesthood in order to become sons & legal hei[rs] [o]f salvation.Erastus Snow followed & spoke much to our edi[f]ycation after which meeting was dismissed.President Young met with the company who were to start back in the morning with the ox teams there were over 60 in number & gave good instruction to them, many of the Battalion deposited there [g]uns with President Young for safe keeping

In the begining of the Council two of the quorum was reproved sharply for undo[i]ng what the majority of the quorum had done in the organizing of the camps for travelling. At first it was not recieved but afterwards the error was recieved & seen, confession made & much teaching given by the President & the power of God rested upon us & our hearts melted & our eyes in tears. The President saidif he did not tell us our faults we would be destroyed but if he told us of them & reproved us we would live in love & our hearts be semented together Brothers Parley P Pratt & J Taylor had been to England & done a good work had returned to winter quarters, & there done wrong by disorganizing the two divisions & companies that the quorum o[f] the Twelve had spent the whole winter in organizing & which was also governed by revelation, Br Parley took the lead in th[e]matter & entirly disregarded our organisation & mixed the co[mp]anies all up Br Young chustized him for his course & taught us principle said that when we set a part one or more of the Twelve to go & do a certain piece of work they would be blessed in doing that & the quorum would back up what they did, but when one or more of the quorum interfere with t[he] work of the majority of the quorum they burn their fingers & do wrong when the majority of the quorum of the 12 plant [a]stake of Zion & esstablish a President over the Stake & appoin[t] a High Council there has the minority of the Twelve one or mor[e] any right to go & interfere with those Councils? No unless they should get corrupt & do wrong then it would be the duty 
 [page torn] [o]f any one of the quorum of the Twelve to show them their error & teach them what was right, & should the majority of those coun-cils get corrupt & try to lead asstray the people it would then be the duty of any one of the Twelve to disannul those councils & call upon the people to sustain him & appoint a new one but while the Councils are trying to do right it would be the duty of the Twelve who might be with them to assist them in carrying out those views that the majority of the Twelve had esstablished. The quorum of the Twelve all decided that Br Pratt had committed an error in not carrying out the organization as esstablished by the Twelve Br Pratt at first had a hard spirit afterwords repented & confessed his fault & the Power of God rested upon President Young & the whole quorum, President Young said that he felt Eternity upon him & was weighed down to the earth with this work & that Br Kimble felt the weight of it more than any other man except himself each one of the quorum expressed their feelings upon the subject & we all had a good timeBr Young said he should chastize Br Parley or any one of thequorum as much as he pleased when they were out of the wasy & they could not help themselves but he done it for their good & ownly done it when constrained to do it by the power of God Br. H. C. Kimball addressed by [br] Young & wished him to rest as much as possible & let his brethren bear his burthens He said he wanted Br Brigham to save himself for he was waring down. I feel tender toward you & want you to live, & If I or my Brethren do wrong tell us of it & we will repent. Br Brigham said there was not a better set of men on the earth than the Twelve & he intended to chastize them when they need it that they might be saved & love him & stick by him. we all felt good to be there for the Lord was with usSeptember 5, 1847 ~ Sunday5th We travled to day to the springs.

At about 9 oclock the call was made to get up the horses. I started for the horses which was in the timber abou[t]half a mile from Camp I got about two thirds of the way to the hors[es]when one of the most exciting seenes wcommenced I ever witnessedI herd the report of several ^guns^ in quick succession and herd the guard cr[y] 
 Indians, Indians, And in less than a minute the timber & bluffs were lined with mounted Indians charging with all speed upon our guard, horses &camp they shot at two or three of the guard but missed them theytook one of the guard & tryed to carry him off on a horse. He knocked oneof them down with his fist & got away from them some of theBrethren snaped their guns at them but they did not go off, assoon as I herd the report of the guns, & the cry of Indians & saw them driving off our horses & gathering thick & fast upon everyhand & being without either horse or arms I run to the camp with all speed & gave the alarm & called upon all to gather their arms &mount their horses. Brothers Kimball, Rockwood, Mathews, & ^99^several others sprung onto their horses with their guns & pistols & runto stop the horses which the Indians were taking away one party of Indians had driven 5 or 6 Horses & Mules over the Hills Br Kimballtook after them. two Indians had gone over the Bluff with myHorse & Mule Brother Rockwood took after them. At the sametime about 20 horses came rushing toward Camp which the Indianshad frightend Br Young with great exhertion with the assistanceof one or two other Brethren succeding in stoping them & gettingthem into camp. As soon as I arived in camp I opened my trunk took out my belt containing 8 pistol shots & harnessed it ontomyself as quick as possible put a saddle & bridle onto a brokendown horse for the want of a better one & I mounted without spur or whip & started for the chase after my own horses. I could not travel vary fast over the rough ground & bluffs on a poor horse but I went as fast as I could. As soon as I left camp Ibegan to rise the bluffs I saw Indians gathering thicker & faster uponevery hand & began to close in between me & the camp. As I passedby one Indian he was priming his gun. But I continued the chaseAs soon as my horse & mule got over their fright & got out of sight of camp, they tryed to return to camp & troubled the Indians about driving them and Brother Rockwood soon came near them and one stoped & met him when they found they wereovertaken & professed friendship the other still tried to drive offthe horses Br Rockwood fired a pistol at him & he run & leftthe horses & the other Indian left also & Rockwood son soon started my horses towards ^me^ I soon came up to his assistance & some other Brethren alsocame up & assisted me in ketching them & while I was doing this near40 Indians surrounded Br Kimball who started for the otherhorses. some of the Brethren started to his assistance after I hadstarted for camp with my horses. Indians were also upon evryside of me untill I got into camp I secured my horses insid thecamp and by this time about 150 warriors had gatherd to getherclose to our camp all dressed in the greatest stile for a war chargeand the old chif began to address to the top of his horse voicethe Indians and also our camp, tlelling us they were good Sioux and they thought we were Crows or snakes. When they found they could notget any more of our horses & 3 had been retaken which they stole they then professed friendship there was 11 horses taken by the Indians they numbered at about 200 warriors on the ground & well mounted & their was not over20 of our men including the guard that was engaged in any way in stopingthe horses, or saving them, or retaking those that were stolen. Br Gould took one Indian horse & all and another Indian brought back Thomas Woolsays horse which was among the stolen & exchanged him for the Indians horse, this with my two horses were the ownly ones retaken during theskirmish. But when the Indians gatherd before the camp they saw we 
 as a body were armed & that we knew them & had fed them & treated them kindly while on our way to the valley. the old Chief then proposed that we smoke the pipe of peace. And also said that if our chief pointing to President Young would go to their Camp they would smoke with him& give him up the horses which his men had taken but Brother Young did not feel well & we did not think it prudent for him to go, while in this conversation Br Kimball who had been out on the chase after the horses returned bare headed (having droped his hat) was accompanied by Br Benson & in riding into camp rushed his horse through the midst of the Indians & they fearing some treachery or that he was an enemy coming upon them in their rear, they instantly leaped upon their horses, scattered & rushed from the camp some runing into the creek all appeared in great fright. But as soon as they saw there was no evil at hand they returned & took their places & had a harty laugh at their fright. Br Kimball volenteered to accompanied the Chief into his camp in the place of Br Young that we might get our horses I volunteered & also Stephen Markham to go with Br Kimballon the expedition so we three mounted our horses & set out accompanied by a Frenchman (who could speak a little sioux language) & the Indians to find their Camp; they told us it was one mile we travled 7 miles over Bluffs & valleys & came in sight of their Camp some 3 miles from us moving towards us. so we called a halt & waited for them to come upthey came & pitched about 100 lodges & their was about 600 Indians many women & children & they brought with them about 1000 horses & mules nearly all of them we supposed were stolen from emigrants & & other tribes. their encampment presented quite a grand, interesting & amusing scenery among their horses we readily discoverd ours which was stolen the night we camped we camped with Br Grants Company we lost 49 that night which they had among their number. The old Chief called the war Chiefs & placed them on his left hand & ourselves on his right & set down upon the grass & filled a long pipe with Kennickenick & smoked & passed it to his Chiefs they smoked & passed it to us we also smoked he then pointed to us to pick out our horses which we undertook to do but found it no easy task to pick out 7 or 8 horses scattered through one thousand others for one or two miles up & down the creek however after a laborious search we got all but two that was stolen this morning. We then spoke to him about the 49 horses which they had stolen from us before, they acknowledged they had got the horses & gave us some incouragement of letting us have them when they got to Laramie but would not let us have them then they however let us have one of them ownly thebrethren brought about 3 bushels of salt as a present to him we then returned to camp with our horses, which ended the business of the day the Camp did not move but few rods I travled about 18 mIt rained some during the nightSeptember 22, 1847 ~ Wednesday22nd A cool rainy morning it seemed to be the equenoxial stomr tho[u]ghnot vary tedious we thought it wisdom to leave the ground & continue our journey we travled 18 miles & camped on Bitter creek we had but little grass but plenty of water 18 mileSeptember 23, 1847 ~ Thursday23rd we travled to day 30 miles & camped at night at the wa[rm] spring we did not get through untill 9 oclok at night the moonshone most briliantly we took our horses forward to the spring to water them & then drove our waggons on the South road half a mile.

Br Stillman shot a buffalo cow I went with my carriage into the Bluffsabout 2 miles & we dressed it which took untill near night I shotat 2 calves & got neither of them, we did not get into camp untill 9 oclok at night & Br Stillman & myself worked untill 1 oclok cutting & salting up meat I got but little sleep 16 m * Whatever the Lord inspires you to do in this matter I am with youOctober 13, 1847 ~ Wednesday13th Our horses are failing more & more daily several gave out todaywe travled 14 miles & camped on the north fork of the Platt webegin to come again to some timber, some buffalo were killedto day & large herds near us 14 mOctober 14, 1847 ~ Thursday14th We travled 15 miles & camped on the Platt or rather a slew runing into it, it was cool & windy 15October 15, 1847 ~ Friday15th We travled 14 miles to day & camped on the Platt 14 mnothing of particular interest occured during the dayOctober 16, 1847 ~ Saturday16th we travled to day out of the buffalo range & camped on thePlatt.

Br LukeJohnson came near being killed by a herd of buffalo travellingin the night. A large herd came upon him suddenly & he was caught in the midst of thems & could not get out & the herdwas some 15 minutes passing him & the ownly way he kept themfrom treading on him was by hollowing & striking & punchingthem with his cane on each side of him as they came along& they would open just wide enough for him to stand as they passed along 15 
 October 17, 1847 ~ Sunday17th Sunday as we had not meat enough to carry our Camp to winter Quarters it was thought wisdom for a company of hunters to return back a few miles with some waggons to the buffalo herds & procure some more meat. Twelve of us returned back 10 miles with three waggons A Lyman & myself was among the number, we pitched our camp in a little timber on a slew of water & we killed two buffalo during the evening & brought in including buctchers & teamsters there was about 20 of us & we were all hungry & after cleaving the body of the meat from the bones our company roasted the bones, & for our supper & breakfast we used up the bones of both buffaloes it is almost incredible what amount of roasted buffalo meat a hungry man will eat without salt or bread & not make him sick. there is no other meat known that a man can eat as much of. The hump bones of a fat buffalo roasted is the most choice eating of any meat kind the leg bones are also filled with marrow more choice than butter & yield a great quantity which we roasted & drank the melted marrow without bread. We should have made a delightful picture for an artist to have drawn the scenery around our fireside. After all had eaten to our full satisfaction we prepared to make our beds for the night, it was cold & blew a perfect gale. we made choice of a thicket of willows under a bank for our lodging place for the night we lay down on the ground & covered ourselves over with our blankets & robes & had a good nights rest 12.October 18, 1847 ~ Saturday18th At daylight 4 of us went to the Bluffs to exahamine the posit-ion of the herds of buffalo, we saw many both on the Hills & flats we returned to Camp took our breakfast of roast meat then divi-ded & went out two by two, Luke Johnson went with me about 3 miles from Camp, we came upon 3 wild horses upon the side of the bluff, they were splendid looking animals but the most wild of any animals I ever saw. After returning to the Bluffs we found that the herds on the upland were travling to the N. & N.E & the ownly way to obtain meat was for the hunters to confine themselves to theherds on the flat they did so & killed nine buffalo but seven of them was dressed & brought in & wolves feasted on the other two. we got council from Camp for us to return early in the morning & not tary any longer, we travled in our hunt during the day 16 mOctober 19, 1847 ~ Tuesday[FIGURE]19th Early this morning we prepared ourselves to return to camp. the company of hunters started a little before the waggons, we had got about a mile on the way when we discoverd 7 men about 2 miles from us coming from some scattering timber we at first took them to be Indians on foot we saw they were approach-ing us we soon found however they were mounted white men we then thought they were troops. they soon charged upon us with all speed, we stood ready with our arms in hand to meet them, but when they came up to our great surprise & joy we found them to be the Policce of Winter Quarters led by Brother Hosea Stout. they informed us that 16 of them had come from Winter Quarters to meet our camp thinking wemight need some help the remainder of the party stoped at our main camp, we stoped our teams & returned with then to our camp ground & got the Brethren some breakfast out of the fat 
 Buffalo. & while this was going on we were busy in asking many questio[ns] about our wives & children & friends & affairs at Winter Quarters & they were truly welcome messengers & like Angels unto us. It was truly likegood news from a far country to hear from our families & friends once more. We travled together through the day and arived in Camp at 8 oclok in the evening & had an interview with the rest of the Brethren from Winter Quarters it was truly a happy meeting I spent the evening at Dr Richards waggon reading the papers con-cerning the Mexican War, the Ship fever making devastation through the land, & other affairs through the United States It was truly interesting day to me. distance 25October 20, 1847 ~ Wednesday20th The meat we had killed, this morning was divided in camp we then continued our journey it had much the appearance of a cold storm, from the no[r]th East it did rain some during the day we travled 30 miles & camped upon grand Island it was a tedious cold day & night we fed our horses on rushes & Cotton wood 30 mOctober 21, 1847 ~ Thursday21st We travled 16 miles & camped on wood river fed our horses on rushes & cotton wood it has been cold to day 16 mOctober 22, 1847 ~ Friday22nd We travled 14 miles & camped on the open prairie by a slew of water I have taken cold & did not feel well to day 14October 23, 1847 ~ Saturday23rd We crossed the country 23 miles to day over broaken sandy land to the Lou fork of the Platt & camp on the bank of the stream at the ford it was a warm plesant day we had nothing but dry grassto feed our horses on at night which is poor feed to work on 23 milesOctober 24, 1847 ~ Sunday254th Sunday we tried to ford the Lou fork several men crossed on hor[se]-back there horses fell & plunged the men into the water, several waggons followed, horses got stalled into the quick sand & waggons had to be halled out by hand & it was given up for the day the Camp moved down the river one mile & camped for the day it was vary cold & windy & a snow storm at night which made it bad on our poor weak horses we cut down cotton wood trees & fed them on the limbsOctober 25, 1847 ~ Monday25th [FIGURE] we spent about 2 hours searching for a ford the water was cold some snow on the ground in the morning it disappeared after the sun got up we found a ford and all got over much better than we expect some of the first teams got down & had to be helped out as soon as the road was packed we went well we travled 10 miles & camped on the platt at an old Indian town.

He said that many men through their con-duct would have taken from them that which they had & given to another.He said that when a man had a jewel given to him he ought to prize it &treasure it up & take good care of it & in process of time other jewelsmight be given him of the Lord, but he should not undertake to steal them for he could not keep them, and a man should notbe in a hurry to obtain any blessing or exhaltation that is not forhim & when he has proved himself faithful in all things beforeGod there is no good thing that will be withheld from him in time or Eternity & many other good instructions were givenPresident Joseph Young followed with interesting remarks& gave it as his opinion that Br Andrews ought to be cut off fromthe Church for adultery, most of the quorum of the Twelve spoke upon the subject also the presidents of the Seventies afterwhich it was moved & carried that Milo Andrews be cut offfrom the church for adultery. it was also moved and carried that the woman be cut off from the Church fromor adultery.

The names of the seventies was then called over and President Young remarked that it would not be necessary to put them or be organized into quorums while here but remain in a body under their presidents untill they arived at thevalley, that while any quorum of the seventies of twelve were full though they might be scattered to the fore corners of the earth would not be filled up in Zion or any place but when there wasa vacancy by death or aposticy then the vacancy might be filledwe learned from Presidents Youngs teaching that it was necess[ary]to keep up a full organization of the Church through all time as far as could be at least the three first Presidency quorumof the Twelve Seventies, and Patriarch over the whole Churc[h]&c so that the devil could take no advantage of us.The subject was discused or spoke upon by O.

 December 28, 1847 ~ Tuesday[2]8th In company with the Twelve I crossed the river on the ice & returned to winter quarters I was nearly sick, when I reached home & had been was nearly all the when time at conference 12 mDecember 29, 1847 ~ Wednesday29th I attended a council with the Presidency & High council and herd the report of Br Cutler who had been on a mis[s]ion to the South his report was interesting it showed the Lord was opening doors for the further progress of the work in the earth esspecially among the Lamanites. may the Lord hasten the work.The Brethren put up my chimney to day which had follen downDecember 30, 1847 ~ Thursday30th I spent the day at home choreing Br Alger brought me a load of corn to day, it was a damp wet day Br Wild spent the evening with meDecember 31, 1847 ~ Friday31st [FIGURE] This is the last day of 1847 I went to the mill and got 8 bushels of wheat ground I had an interview with President Young in the morning upon a variety of subjects among which was the object of going east on a mission. we were introduced to Mr Mulho-land from Nauvoo and herd letters read from there Help me keep thy commandments O LordThus ends annother Year which has been interesting and important year to the Saints. The Twelve Apostles with their brethren, one hundred and fourty three souls as pioneers have made a journey more than one thousands miles to the Rocky mountains and sought out a place for a city, a stake of Zion, and a Temple of the Lord that the saints may have a place to flee to while the indignation of the Lord passeth over the nation that hath driven them out. Our Journey to the mountains & back again to Winters Quarters with horse, mule, and ox teams has been over 2000 miles more than half of the journey we have had to make new roads & with all of our exposures, sickness, & dangers not a human life has been lost but all returned in safety and what is more singular still, not a horse mule ox, cow, or calf was lost either going or returning except 2 horses shot by disobeying council. The blessing of the Lord has been great upon us as a people during the past year in all the various portions of the Camp of Israel. we have now found a place to build a Stake of Zion whare the people can gather together & build up Zion. The past year has shown forth the fulfi-llment of Prophecy in the wars, rumours of wars, famins, pestilence, distress of nations with perplexity and in many of the signs of the times. The United States in their wars with the feble Nation of Mexico have involved themselve in a debt of one hundred and fifty millions of dollars besides the loss of twenty five thousand men & twice that number to Mexico and their own expenses in the war, the famine has raged in Irleland, the cholera through Europe, the breaking of banks & merchants has distressed the people in England. The Baron Rothchilds the rich Jew has become a member in the British Parliament which is a new eary in the History of the Jews, & they the Jews are gathering home to Jerrusalem by thousands what 1848 will bring to pass in the History of the Church and Kingdom of God time must determin and also in the History of the Nations of the Earth. May the LORD hasten the gathering of Israel & the building up of Zion for Jesus Christ Sake AmenThe following page contains a synopsis of my travels during the year of 1847

G A Smithopened the meeting by prayer and W Woodruff addressedthe assembly upon the subject of their being one in all things& the gathering of Israel, building up of Zion, &c. And wasfollowed by President Young who made many good remarks [FIGURE] He said the Lord would give his spirit to teach and instruct from the private member to the President of the church, buthe will never give any man or woman his spirit to dictate & direct his file leader, he related an anacdote of a female runing a race upon a great wager lost it by stoping on the way to pick up a Jewel. He said truly that if we were not one wewere not the Lords.In speaking of the duties of the Priesthood he said if this people holding the Priesthood should settle down& go to cultivating the earth & entirely neglect the preachingof the gospel the earth would open & swallow them up &hide them from his sight.The whole day & eveningwas taken up in teaching & councilJanuary 17, 1848 ~ Monday17th The fore part of the day was taken up in business & teaching & council the spirit of the Lord was with the peopleAmong other subjects President Young s[p]oke upon the subjectof danceing & said that danceing was not an ordinance of thegospel or of the House of the Lord. But the organization of manis such that it requires a variety, singing stimulates the wholesystem & the mental mind to such a degree that they want todance, this is well enough in its place, every thing that is calculated to fill the soul with Joy is ordained of God & is prpoper forthe Saints if they acknowledge God in all things & do not sinbut dont mingle with the wicked world & sin but serve theLord with it. And the ownly lawful place to dance is in a tem-ple or a place of endowments, you will never see any musicor danceing in Hell neither Joy or gladness will be there butthese things will be in Heaven many other interesting rema-rks were made.The afternoon & evening was spent in music and danceingthe old grey headed man, with the young man, maiden andchildren went forth in the dance together & praised the Lordin the dance and all was peace and harmony

And his text was now let the Saints stop dancing for if you get up parties all over thecountry here and go to danceing sin and iniquity will grow out of it but all has been right here thus far I have watched you& all has been in quiete & peacable & good order & the spirit of theLord has been here.

 January 22, 1848 ~ Saturday22nd I spent the day at home choreingJanuary 23, 1848 ~ Sunday23rd Sunday I preached to the saints in my ward was followedby Brs Pulsipher & Porter & we had a good time and in the evening I went to the Council House and met with a large assemblyProfessor Pratt addressed them quite lengthy upon asstronomyphilosophy, and various principles which he had studied much uponand also read a lengthy document which he had written whichwas highly interesting to us. He advised the seventies to devote allof their leasure moments to reading & study & fulfill the commandmentswhich says we should treasure up wisdom & knowledge by faith & bystudy out of the best books that we may have a knowledge of thingsin heaven & on earth of kingdoms & countries things which are at home& abroad, the wars perplexities of nations &c In the lecture given by Professor Pratt he intirely overthrows many of the systems of modernphylosiphers & asstronomiers & modern reasoning in many respects, tooverthrow the gentile Christian Argument, "that God made the HeavensSun, moon, & stars and the earth & all that in them are out of nothingin six days He said that it was admitted by modern phylosophers thatstars had been discoverd through telescopes so remote from the earththat it would take thirty thousand years for the light of it to reachthis earth though it should travel at the rate of two hundred thousand miles per second, so it must have been in exhistance 24000 yearsbefore this earth was formed. He overthrows the principle of Immate-riality & clearly shows that God, Angels, spirits, are material as well asmen, beasts, vegitables minerals, &c that matter is eternal & infinitewithout end or bounds & that space is infinite & without bounds or endthat matter, the elements, intelligence were not created neither indeed can be, & were from all eternity & that God formed theHeavens & earth out of unorganized materials or matters whichdid exhist in some form & were not made out of nothing. Inspeaking of the spirit of God he remarked to me that the HolySpirit that was through all things, and round about all things, & thatgoverned & controlled all things are intelligent atoms the same as God iscomposed of hence it is called the spirit of God, & he had no dobtbut that there were some of these atoms combined in all the miner-al, vegitable, & animal Kingdoms & by the aid of those intelligentatoms were enabled to abide the law by which they were governedmany other interesting principles were presented by Professor Prattwhen he closed I followed him and exhorted the people to listen to his council & improved their time I also advised the Camp to hold meetings in each ward on Sunday & prayer meetings at least one evenings in each week that if they would pray morethey would have much less spirit of complaining among them Iremarked that the spirit of the Lord & the spirit of thedevil would not dwell together but a short time in the same person or tabernacle but one would govern & the other leaveI also warned the people against judging any matter whateveruntill they herd both sides of the question for in most all cases any person would be apt to give a wrong judgment by merelyhearing one side of the question. And that the Elders couldnot be in possession of any to much truth upon any subjectwhatever in order to magnify there callings among the nationsof the earth for if they should be called to stand before KingsPrinces, Asstronomiers Phylosophiers & the learned of the earththey would find use for all there knowledge 
 January 24, 1848 ~ Monday24th I met in council withe the Twelve & High Council & herda charge prefered by the Policee against E. D Wolley for makinguse of sedicious language against the Authorities of the Churchthe letter of the accusation was sustained against Br Wolleybut it was not supposed by any that the spirit of seditionwas in his heart. It proved to be an interesting meeting as muc[h]teaching & instruction was drawn out of the Presidency HighCouncil, Twelve &c. Br Wooley in his plea expressed his feelings that the Hickery Clubs carried by the policee, & the councilfor Bishops to preside over any parties in the place to keep order,and that the Policee would not suffer a man to let his own cattleget into his own crops to destroy them were oppressive to hisfeelings. President Young said he wanted to speak upon the spirit of the thing with Br Wolleys, that the things that oppressBr Wolleys feelings would have no effect upon him if all hadbeen right with him but he had got the spirit of the world & didnot feel right. Said that the law was for the unruly & that it must rest upon good men in order to reach the unruly &transgresser. many gave their opinion upon the subjectBr Wooley made his confession that he had spoken in an im-proper manner in a moment of passion he was forgiven by thecouncil & all was settled. W. Woodruff in his remarks said he would advise evry individual not to make any decision or giveany judgment or opinion upon any subject whatever untillthey herd both sides of the question, Council was dismissed & we returned home. Brs Pratt & Levi Richards & myselfvisited Br Henman's family to administer to them for the wholefamily was sick & had been troubled with evil spirits we prayed with this family & laid hands upon 7 that weresick of the household the spirit of the Lord was with us& we rebuked the sickness & commanded the evil spirits to depart & they recieved a blessing upon the family.

 January 30, 1848 ~ Sunday30th Sunday we had one of the most terrible storms we have had for several Years it has been exeeding worm for many days the wind blew hard from the North commenced raining & freezing then snowing & exeeding cold & the storm lasted through the day and night which blew snow into many houses it was also tedious upon cattle. Mrs Woodruff was quite sick through the night & kept her bead through the dayJanuary 31, 1848 ~ Monday31st The storm abated in the latter part of the night & the sun arose plesant this morning I spent the day at homeFebruary 1, 1848 ~ TuesdayFeb 1st I spent the day at home choreingFebruary 2, 1848 ~ Wednesday2nd I spent the day reading & writingFebruary 3, 1848 ~ Thursday3rd I attended a feast prepared by the defenders of Nauvoo or those who were in the Battle of Nauvoo most of those who composed the assembly were individuals who were in that memoriable action it was ascerted that there was not more than 100 saints at any one time in the fight while the mob that was fighting agaist the Saints numbered from 800 to 1000 and their was but three of the Saints killed and one or two slightly wounded while there was several waggon loads of the mob killed & many wounded & the enemy driven from the field, but the Lord was with the Saints & saved their lives. The Saints wore a read badge on the left arm to distinguish them from their enemies in the battle, they wore the same to day at the feast at the opening of the performences President Kimball deliverd anaddress upon the subject of the Battle of Nauvoo & was followedby Col Johnson, after which their was feasting singing music & some dancing. A figure was got up called the Battle of Nauvoo whiched was danced & the Saints felt to praise the Lord for their deliveranceFebruary 4, 1848 ~ Friday4th I spent the day at home reading the Book of EnochFebruary 5, 1848 ~ Saturday5th I went into the woods with several of the Brethren & choped loaded & brought home five loads of woodFebruary 6, 1848 ~ Sunday6th Sunday I preached to a congregation of Saints in Br Phineas Richards ward & had a good timeFebruary 7, 1848 ~ Monday7th I spent most of the day reading I read a pamphlet called the voice of truth, containing the Prophet Joseph Smith views of the powers & policy of the government of the United States, and corressppondence with Gen James Arlington Bennett,appeal to the green mountain Boys, correspondence with, John C. Calhoon, and Henry Clay, a friendly hint to Missouri, and an interesting sermon from President Smith. These letters & writings are of much interest & show the spirit of the tim-es & the mighty rebuke of wicked men by that great, good, & wise Prophet Joseph I was much edifyed in reading it I spent the evening in reading the book of Jasher & was edifyed with that Br Benbow & myself laid hands upon a sick youthFebruary 8, 1848 ~ Tuesday8th I spent the day at home during the meeting at our school house in the evening I gave a synopsis of my meditations concerning our duties as a people 
 February 9, 1848 ~ Wednesday9th I have been troubled for several days with a head ake I finished reading the Book of Jasher & found it to be an interesting work. It speaks of the great victories the Twelve Patriarchs the sons of Jacob accomplished in their Battles with their enemies in consequence of their great faith in God and of Joseph career in Egypt & many other interesting thingsFebruary 10, 1848 ~ Thursday10th [FIGURE] I made President B Young a present of fine blue broad cloth which I got in England I spent a part of the day with Br Young I walked with him from the office to Br Warner Porters whare President Young administ[ered] in the ordances of the house of the Lord. I read several papersfrom the eastern states which gives an account of the dredful famine in Ireland more than 130,000 persons have died in the famine and apparently the destress has but just began, also the the breaking of the banks and large firms throughout England which has caused a great panic & much perplexity throughout those nations the United States are still at war with Texas & much division in the government concerning the warFebruary 11, 1848 ~ Friday to February 12, 1848 ~ Saturday11th & 12th I still suffer with pain in the head I spent these days at home reading writing & choreingFebruary 13, 1848 ~ Sunday13th Sunday It is the most beautiful & warm weather that [FIGURE] I ever saw in the winter time. The Camp of of the Saints met at the stand for a meeting to day meeting opened by singing, & prayer by W. Woodruff, the meeting was thenaddressed by President Kimball then addressed the meeting and said that he wanted to give an exhertation and a word of caution and after reproving the saints said many flattered themselves that they were going to lean upon others to save them without doing any thing themselves but they will get disappointed, for to bring up a figure he said you migh[t]graft ever so many sproughts into a tree if they did not adhear to the tree they would remain there dead sticks stick-ing out of the tree they would be dead themselves, not bring forth fruit, & do the tree no good but ownly scar it up, & those scars would remain untill the dead sticks were broakke off & the skcar healed over or other grafts put in that would bring forth fruit. So it was with all who leaned upon others to save them & would not harken to their council & take their advice & no man can save them if do not save themselves and many other remarks of Interest he made.W. W. Phelps then read the V chapter of Math as he had translated it from the greekW Woodruff advised the people who were going to settle on the east side of the river not to settle on the bank or in the bottoms so that the first flood need not wash them into the Mo river.Meeting was dismissed after which in company with Mrs Woodruff I went to Br Pulsiphers and soon Presidents Young & Kimball came & attended to sealing four couple in matrimony, we had a feast of spruice beer & cakes on the occasion 
 during the evening I attended the meeting of the Seventies being 3 of their presidents present, Joseph Young Z. Pulsipher A. P. Rockwood the House was crouded to excess the meetingwas opened by singing & prayer. And was then addressed by A P Rockwood who spoke upon the government of children that Parents ought to set a good exhample before their children & not nickname them but call them by their proper name for the way that Parents set their children going in life they are apt to go through & if they start with Jim, Jo, & Pall, they are apt to go through life so,.Br Pulsipher followed & made many interesting remarks. And he was followed by President Joseph Young who reproved them in the spirit of the Lord against the spirit of dancing & warned them to forsake all sin & be faithful in all things He spoke in the spirit and power of God feeling the responsibility he was under when he closed his remarks W. Woodruff arose and said that should I say that I did not desire to address the Seventies I should do dishonor to my own feelings for I do desire it at this time. All who know my course when I have been at head quarters with the Presidency either with Joseph, Brigham, or others of the twelve know that I have never put myself forward to preach or teach the people, why hath it been so, because I have had file leaders between me and God whose business it is to lead teach & instruct the inhabitants of Zion and I have felt it more my duty to sit & hear while with them at head quarters than to put myself forward to teach yet when I have been called upon to speak I have endeavoured to do the best I could, but when I have been abroad in the vineyard I have had the spirit of my mission & been much blessed in bringing souls into the kingdom of God. And I do feel it a privilege to address the Seventies at this time, Br Young asked me to speak in the fore part of the evening but I desired to wait untill the Presidency of Seventies had address them and I can now see that it was wisdom for I should not have had the same matter before me that I now have, I have a number of things resting upon my mind which I wish to lay before you. Your President Joseph Young has spoken to you in the spirit & power of God to night has warned & exhorted you not to defileyour Priesthood & calling & not to have your minds all taken up with fiddleing & dancing. I have taken up more real injoy-ment this evening in hearing the teaching giving by your Presidency than I would in hearing a million of dollars worth of fiddle strings worn out, you must not think hard of Br Joseph Young because he reproves, rebukes, & ehxhorts you with all long sufferings & doctrin, for their is an almighty responsibility resting upon his shoulders as the seenier President of this August body of Sevenenties ordained unto the Apostle-ship and the Lord will hold him responsible for the manner that he watches over the Seventies and he is stired up from time to time by the spirit of the God of Israel to reprove you and the rebukes of a friend are far better than the kisses of an enemy and you must not think hard of Br Young if he does reprove you for he does it for your good. It is for better for you to spend your time getting instruction & council than in fiddleing & dancing for while the latter is of no profit to you the former you will need when you are seperated far from your Brethren 
 and abroad among the nations of the earth amid the Judgments of God which are laying waste the people & while you have to dodge between wind & water to save your headin the midst of persecution a[f]ter persecution & mobs while you are offering salvation to the people. I have meditated much of late concerning the responsibility we are to Godunder to God inasmuch as we bear the priesthood & are numbered among the Lords Anointed as Angels arewatching us & bearing a report of us daily to God should the Lord come down to see us to see for himself if the reports of [us] was correct, what would the Lord think of us & how would we like to hear the record read in the morning of the resurrection containing an account of an assembly of the Lords Anointed at Winter Quarters, upon whom all heaven leaned & depended upon in carrying out the purposes of the Lord in the Lord last dispensation & fulness of times and fulfilling the expectations of Abraham, Isaac & Jacob & all the Holy Prophets & Apostles since the world began in gathering the Jews & rebuilding Jerrusalem gathering the saints & rebuilding up Zion preparing the way for the endowment of the ten tribes of Israel in the north country & the covertion of the Lamanites in the west, & the warning of all the gentile world that they may be left without excuse when the Judgments of God cleanse the earth from sin, wickedness, & pollution, and that our prayersshould ascend into the heavens for the Lord to avenge the Blood of the Prophet Joseph & other saints who have been martered & slain by gentile mobs in the last days, while there is so much depending upon us & our prayers should we be satisfyed with the record of this city of the Saints in the eternal world kept by the Angels of Heaven If we should hear read before an assembled world that the inhabitants of Winter Quarters who were the Lords Anointed during the winter of 1847 & 8 spent nine days of their time in fiddleing & dancing whare they did one in prayer & praise to almighty God, I say would we be satisfyed with such record? No we would not, then let us turn from such seenes of folly & spend more time in meetings for preaching, exhortation, & prayer before the Lord Br Joseph exhorted the Elders "not to defile their Priesthood." I will here say If any man wants to feel the pangs of Hell let him have the Priesthood & let him haveimmortal glory, eternal life, Thrones power domin-ions, exhaltations with all the blessings of Abraham, Isaac & Jacob in view, then let him break the law of God & defile his Priesthood and in a moment he falls from his high esstate and all of his exhalted hopes vanish in a moment & when his eyes are open to see things as they are he sinks in darkness & wo& the vary sight of the blessings which he has lost causes a hotter Hell through his soul than fire and brimestone many other remarks were made by the speaker after which Br Cumings addressed the meetings & spoke of his mission to England made some vary appropriate remarks after which the meeting closed 
 February 14, 1848 ~ Monday14th I spent the day at homeFebruary 15, 1848 ~ Tuesday15th I spent the day at home but had a good meeting at nightFebruary 16, 1848 ~ Wednesday16th I spent this day at home readingFebruary 17, 1848 ~ Thursday17th I carried 9 bushels of wheat & 5 of buckwheat to thewater mill I spent the day untill 12 oclok at night withBr Davis grinding in the mill Mrs Woodruff spent thetime with Sister Davis & we went home in the nightFebruary 18, 1848 ~ Friday18th The soldiers have a meeting to day at the Log tabe-rnacle Br Young, Kimball, & O. Pratt was expected to be there, O Pratt was there but the others were at Br Hydes as he had just returned from the east.we also recieved a large mail to day from various partsof the earth several stars from Liverpool showing therapid progress ot our cause through England Scotland and Wales and of the hard warfare of our worthy friend Capt Dan Jones it seems as though nearly all Waleswas against him yet he is baptizing daily as he is travl-ing through the nation we also got news of the MexicanWar, American Congress, the loss of life on the lakes &rivers &cFebruary 19, 1848 ~ Saturday19th I administered to Br Willard Richards early in themorning who has been sick near two months I spent mostof the day in reading Br Johnathan containing the lifeof Gen Z Taylor History of the Mexican War and plates ofthe several Battles in Mexico &cFebruary 20, 1848 ~ Sunday20th Sunday I preached to the saints in our ward. In the evening I went with Mrs Woodruff to Br P. Richards & herd two lettersread from his Sons in England which were interesting, we thencalled upon Willard Richards who was sick soon President Youngcame in sat a few moments and I went home with him &spent an hour or two and read some late papersFebruary 21, 1848 ~ Monday21st I spent the day at homeFebruary 22, 1848 ~ Tuesday22nd Br John Grierson came to the city to day the first time he hasbeen here for one year & a half I look him up & brought him homewith me he attended meeting with me in the evening and spent the night with me. He took his cloths which Br Smoot leftwith us for himFebruary 23, 1848 ~ Wednesday23rd [FIGURE] I called upon Br Richards in the morning soon Pres-ident Young came in we went into the office & attended to some Business. Br Brown came in & requested one of usto go & preach the funeral sermon of his daughter who wasdead. Presidents Brigham & Joseph Young & myself wentto his house, we found not ownly his daughter dead but a number sick in the house. The meeting opened bysinging & prayer by Joseph Young, after which PresidentB. Young arose addressed the meeting & said that he had a few rem-arks to make & desired that he might have the Holy spirit while hespoke. Said it was better to go [to] the House of mourning than to the House of feasting for that was the end of the living & would force upon our minds the truth of the desolution which we must all pass through 
 we mourn for the loss of our friends when they die but ifthey die in the Lord they are better off than the living for theyhave gained one victory which the living have not they are beyound the reach of pain, sorrow, wicked men, devils, anddevlish spirits which we are not, for we are daily in themidst of all the suffering that mortal man is heir to & when will this suffering end, when we die & not before,unless we should live untill Satan is bound but all mustpass through death. Yet I would be glad to live to assist inbinding Satan as to the Saints we are being worn outaccording to the workd of the Lord we have been driven &persecuted in such a manner that there are but few constit-utions among us except such as are broaken to peaces &ready to fall into the grave & we are burying up the Saintsvary fast whareever we go over four hundred are laid in the grave in this place & many in all places whare wehave stoped, but all of this pain, sorrow, death & afflictionwill work to gether for the good of the Saints for these things must needs be in order to work out the purposes ofthe Almighty & give the Saints there exhaltation and Glory inthe Eternal World. the sectarian wourld with the knowledgethey have would if it was in their power sweep the fall of man, death, pain, sorrow & afflictions with all theirattendant evils into oblivion & caused man to have livedeternally as he was before the fall that he might never have seen death, but such a course would in the end havebeen the greatest curse that could have been heaped upon manfor by so doing it would entirely have frustrated the designof the Almighty in the Creation of man & blocked up the wayfor his exhaltation glory & greatness & the Lord understood the subject so well before either the world or man was formedthat a Saviour was provided in the Lamb slain from before thefoundation of the world to redeem man from Eternal deadso that by man paying the deabt of the fall by passing throughthe temporal death, they recieve the power & glory of theresurrection by Jesus Christ which gives them an Immortalbody which will recieve a far greater glory and power thanthe mortal body ever could have obtained unto had it nothave been for the fall. And I suppose If I had power IWiththe limited Knowledge I have I should sweep from the midstof this people sickness, pain, sorrow, poverty & persecution & mobingsI dont suppose I should ever have suffered this people to havebeen driven at all by a mob but as the Lord knows so much more than we do He has suffered it so to be & it is for a wisepurpose in God, it is for our good & will finally prove forour exhaltation & glory in the eternal world, & gives us experience in this life which we otherwise should not have had. "Adam fell that men might be, men are that they may have Joy, but ifthey knew no Joy they would have no sorrow, and if they did notknow misery they would not know happiness" for man must experience one in order to comprehend & know the other Jesushad to descend below all things in order to ascend above all things,I am fully convinced that all our sorrows & troubles will workout for us a far more exeeding & eternal wait of glory, hence weought nought to murmer or complain at our fate. It is truewe mourn at the loss of friends but not as those with out hope 
 or blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from hence forth saiththe spirit for they rest from their labours (& if their friends arefaithful) their works will follow them, but what is the time ofour suffering in this life in comparison with Eternity After we havespent millions of ages in Eternity & we look back upon our time here& it will ownly look like the twinkling of an eye in comparisonand so it will be in the waiting for the resurrection of our bodiesit will be for a moment as it were before we shall stand in ourimmortal bodies but no person can have power to raise the deadexcept he holds the Keys of the Resurrection & no man can holdthe Keys of the resurrection or be ordained unto that poweruntill he has died & been raised from the dead himself nomore than than a man has power to baptize a man legally& lay hands upon him for the Holy Ghost & ordain him to theoffice of an Elder who has not been baptized or ordained himself. Michael the Ark Angel (Adam) holds the Keys of theresurrection and after a man is raised from the dead has an immortal body & recieves an ordination to hold the Keys ofthe resurrection from under the Hands of Michael or thosehaving authority he then has power to raise the dead & not before. Jesus was the first fruits of the Resurrection "He hadpower to lay down his life & power to take it again," [##John 10:18##] when He had lain in the grave three days an Angel, some person who was appointed to this work appeared rolled back the stone & calledJesus forth. We have power here through the Priesthood to layhands upon the sick & they recover, to cast out devils open the eyesof the blind & unstop the ears of the deef according to the faith of the chil-dren of men. It is just as easy to raise the dead for one who is ordainedunto this power as it is for us to administer in the ordinances of theHouse of the Lord here. Some times we lay hands upon the sick &they are healed instantly other times with all the faith & medicine theyare a long time getting well, & others die. The spirit of devils whoare deprived of having tabernacles are constantly making war withmen who have tabernacles & they strive to take up their abode inthe tabernacles of men because they have none of their own, & wherethey can get a chance they will many of them croud into one man& try to reign there & some times they will kill the body & then the spirit of the man & devils all have to leave it some times in sickness & weakness the spirit of deavels get possession of thebody whare the spirit of man is pure & overcomes it but themoment the spirit leaves the body it is beyound the power &reach of the devils, some children are killed in this way forthe devil is making war with every thing that has a tabernacleesspecially the Saints, & the devil rules a great deal in the heartsof the children of men, and if he cannot go in any other way he will go into a barrel of whiskey & run down their throatsand when the saints get into the valley away from the valleygentiles the deavel will get into the Half mormons Hickerymormons & will plead with them to get into them but when we consider how little time we have to spend in this life incomparison to Eternity we ou[gh]t not to consider it a hard matterto be faithful to God & keep his commandments for when weobtain Celestial glory we shall have to exclaim that it is throughthe grace of God after all, for the glory far exceeds our sufferings in this life.Manny Many other remarks were made byPresident Young and meeting was dismissed by W Woodruff

I walked out in the evening with PresidentYoung to Thomas Bullocks & Br Whitehead council was given tothem concerning emigration 
 March 17, 1848 ~ Friday17th March 1848 I spent the day at home I attended a Council of much importance in the evening. The Captain of the Policee with two others who were members of the Seventies were brought before the Presidency of the Seventies for assault & batterry & swearing. There was present but three of the Presidents of the Seventies, but the High Council was present also President Young & W Woodruff it was agreed by the parties to trythe case before the High Council, which was filled up and the charges read, the defendants did not exactly plead guilty so the testimony was heard on both sides & it was proven there was a fight betweenthem & swearing. The Plaintiff opened the subject called witne-sses who testifyed. The defendants spoke & bore their testimony the Plaintiff then made his plea & also his councillor the defendants then made their plea also their Councellor.Then President Young arose and addressed the council in an interesting manner the following is an extract of the Clerks munites of the President speech. If all parties are willing I will now make some remarks there are a good many item pertaining to this case. 1st it was to bebrought before the President of the 70, but they did not profess to have any Jurisdiction in the case ownly in the trial of their membership but not as a peace officer. But the High council can sit as a municipal court & try them for Church fellowship and for a breach of duty as a Policee officer is it supp-osed that a public officer cannot do worgong wrong I do not think so & when they do wrong they should be reproved as well as any other person, I shall speak my mind without any regard to parties favor or affection this I always calculate to do whether I gain friends or foes I have plenty of enemies But I dont ask any favors of them I will not be turned for a moment out of the course of right & justice if it cuts mythroat. I shall tell the truths some who have pled this cause dar[e]not tell all the truth, if Mr Hill did tantilize the Policee they hadno business to fall upon him & beat him. I have known Br Hillfor fifteen years He is given to rough uncouth conversation and tantalizing mens feelings, and he wont apostitize neither Let me reason the case I am a teacher I often officiat in that capacity. For instance Hosea Stout says that for 8 years he has had a catalogue of names in his own mind of those who would apostitize and as yet he had not been mistakened If a man under-stands the things of God, he knows well that every Saint of God ifs followed up through life by the powers of Hell, of the devil of temptation, & of evry snare that can be invented on the earth to make him apostitize, loose his glory & crown, this I understand If I see a man doing wrong or is any way faltering If I take a course to make him believe that he will fall does not that at once weaken his faith & disarm him of power to stand? it does, dont I see things as well as the Policee I do and if I saw a man that I knew would fall I would not tell him so but would try to save himas well as I could that when he did go my garments would be clear before God & he could not rise in Judgment against meI am here to save both Br Hosea & Hill but not to destroy them we are here to the Policee as policee and to inquire into their conduct as Elders. Has not Isaac Hill been afflicted and maimed who sent Hosea Stout to take Isaac Hill as a Prisioner Nobody 
 was there disorder. I will admit Isaac Hill was out of ordor to go into a store in the mids of a contention & undertake to tantili-ze a mans feelings while he was in anger under pretence of reproving him for swearing A far better way would have been for him to have waited untill he was calm & composed & took him one side & in a friendly manner said Br Hosea I think your course in the store was not calculated to dignify your office as Captain of the policee and as a member of the Seventies he would then have recieved it vary different from what he did. I know it is natural for Br Hill to tan-talize, but that is no excuse for Br Hosea Stout to fight him, he should have said I am a peace maker and magnifyed his office with dignity & honor but instead of that he desended to the spirit of a tantilizer & fell to fighting & swearing. Policeemen should be men of more noble minds than to desend to such things, or suffer their spirits to mingle with such low degrading things, Hosea Stout did desend to anger & swearing which was disgraceful to a Policee man and men that will practice such things are not fit for policeeman I know the policeemen here are not Just right for they will get together for hours together make fun, toll tales, drick whiskey & get drunk and that is why they are so angry all the while, and they dont praywhen they come together if they did when they saw fighting & contention they would do as John Lytle did when he parted Stout & Hill says he (as he steped between them & shoved one one way & the other the other way) get out of the way stop your fighting I am a peacemaker & wont have it. I never struck a man in my life though I have parted many who were fighting I never saw the day but thatI thought to myself to good to strike a man. Now to the Policee I saystop your baldadash pray with each other now if I have not told the truth tell me of it. I mean to reprove the Policee if we dont get better men in the valley I will vote against them, they have confessed they are angry I want to see the Police officiate in their office without getting angry if they do not they disgrace their office. I know how Brother Hosea Stout feels concerning the spirits that murderedthe Prophets & still hang around us, but dont you know that devils are going to the mountains as well as Saints, we have some of the mea-nest spirits among us on earth the net has halled in good and bad and I am watching them continually, and we have some of the best men with us that swear that are guilty of crime yet they wou-ld lay down their lives for us & for this cause, there are others whowill not gather with the Saints because they think the church is not pure enough for them & they think themselves vary pure & will wait untill the Saints get pure Holy & righteous & during all this time they will live with the world in the midst of wickedness of every kind & think it all well. We have good men & bad men among us, but if I see a bad man or good man that needs reproof I will give it to him but will I go into a store & strike a man? no would it make him any better? No but we should be saviors benovelent & kind & imitate the example of the Savior. men ignorantly fan the flame of mobocracy I have feelings about it, and often say cut his infernal throat still I do not me-an any such thing I am not good enough to do such a thing. The God of Israel was a God of war when Israel went over the read sea & the enemies followed the Lord commanded the waters to overflow them and it obeyed when I get good enough then I can fight to If I have power to command the elements.

He said it wasthe oxigen that entered the system that sustained life that werecieved so much into our bodies each day and that we discha-rged so much each day we flung of so much oxigen at eachresperation He said the oxigen would meet with the Hydragen& carbon & create a heat or cholorie & this was the cause ofthe heat in man the same as it was with a burning lampand if oxigen should scease to be created in man he wouldscease to breath or live, He explained the difference in Quantityof the oxigen created from vegitables or animal food thatanimal food produced far more oxigen than vegitable, andthat the body discharged oxigen much faster in cold cou-ntries than in hot, & in cold weather than in warm andadvised that people subsist more upon animal food in coldweather than in hot. He had tried it by going without animal food for years and became convinced that it was injurious to him Heinjoyed much better health since he made use of animal foodin cold weather fat meat produces oxigen in far greaterquantities than lean and believes this is one reason of the prevelantfevers in Hot Countrys & seasons that oxigen is created somuch faster than it discharges that it breaks the law of natureand the man has to suffer in consequence of it oxigen is also reci-eved & discharged through the pores of the skin and hence theirwas great propriety in keeping the body clean & washing oftenHe urged the necessity & importance of having all dwellinghouses school & meeting houses & all sleeping rooms wellventilated our sleeping ho rooms should be the largest rooms in the house instead of small bedrooms & them closed withoutany fresh air, go into a crouded room that is not wellventilated and the air you breath is poison to the HumanSystem. Mothers should be careful to se to their childrenthat they do not lie with their heads coverd up that they need not breath the air under cover. the faster a personrespires or any creature the oftener he discharges oxigen &the oftener he needs food & the shorter would be his lifewithout it A bird can ownly live 3 days without food a man9 or 12 a child not as long while some anaimals or reptileswill live three months without it A child needs food much oftener than a man it respires oftener discharges oxigen ofte-ner which needs replenishing oftener if a person lives withoutfood the elements pray upon the body itself to creates oxigenthe flesh waste away & the persons dies, it is the fat of thebear, the ground hog, & all animals that burrow up for months without eating that feeds the oxigen & keeps life in the ani-mal yet when he comes out he is poor. He also recommended that we put on warm clothing when we begin to feel thechill of Autum & not wait unill we feel the blast of winter 
 we should eat in the morning before we expose ourselves to riding in the cold, and if we wished to save hay and provinder give our cattle & stock warm stables in winte[r]for it would take much more to sustain the system in the open air he opposed the principle of air tight stove[s]they were not healthy and many other remarks weremade by the speakerI have discoverd in my travels of late in the easternstates a great exhertion among the people to improve thei[r]system of education to make it interesting to the youth& changing the mode of teaching the black board is introduced into the schools generally & it is found notprofitable to confine the scholar in one place not morethan an hour & are are giving attention to children ofweak lungs & stomach using gymnastics &c filling thelungs with air & exploding it suddenly with sounds likeO, Bo, Ba &c loud to exercise the lungs making them standstrait. I find many good things of this kind among the people.But when we look for the thingsof the Kingdom of God it appears to me this nationwas never more barren than at the present time theirhearts seem to be bared up they are bound in bandswhich are made strong & no man can loose them theyseem to be ripe for the judgments of God and wellthey may be inasmuch as they have rejected the gospelshed the blood of Prophets Apostles & Patriarchs & driventhe church & Kingdom of God into the wilderness and havefinally been cut off from the Church & kingdom of God by a general vote & acclemation of the the Saintsof God with uplifted hands to heaven in the Temple ofthe Lord at Nauvoo and who can expect to get access tothe hearts of this Nation now No one their condemnation is made shure & their damnation slumbereth notSeptember 20, 1848 ~ Wednesday[FIGURE] 20th We rode to Scarborough carried Rhoda Foss with[FIGURE] us, spent the night at Fathers Carters I recievedthree letters, from I.

The following is all^so^ anextract from my letter to my wifeI have been much blessed with the spirit of God since I saw youI have felt more of the presence and Power of God with me thanI expected to have enjoyed on this eastern mission. I have feltthat some one has prayed much for me of late, I wonder if itwas Phebe I know you pray much for me I feel its powerand prize it much. I have never felt such a desire to proveworthy of your Confidence and trust, shun evry appearance ofevil, keep out of the path of all temptation, and do rightin all things as I have of late. I have had much of the spirit of Secret Prayer, have poured out my soul in suppli-cation before God with tears of Joy, while the visions of mymind have been open at times to see clearly my duty to myGod to my Wife and Children, to the Saints and world at largeI have also seen of late the awful certain judgments of God which like a gathering storm are ready to burst upon thewhole gentile world esspecially this Nations, who have herd thesound of the gospel, rejected it with all the testimony of theservents of God, have stoned and killed the Prophets aredrunk with the blood of marters and Saints and at last have driven the entire church & kingdom of God with the Priesthoodand Keys of eternal life & salvation out of their midst into thewilderness & the mountains of Israel and by so doing have turned the last key which seals their condemnation whichlingereth not and their damnation which slumbereth nottherefore they cannot escape. Not ownly the Holy Ghost butthat portion of the spirit of God that enlighteneth evry manthat cometh into the world, like a faithful embassador has finished his work and is rapidly taking its flight from Gentile Americaand wo, wo, wo is their DOOM 
 The following verses I penned to my wife at Norwark Ct Oct 18th 1848When shall I hear from my dear wifeFrom those poor suffering pilgraims tooWhose prayers shield me from that strifeWhich daily flow from sin and woIt learns me how to prize their worthWhen I am from them far awayEarthly honors could not call me forthOr make me leave them for so long a dayBut O a message I am call to bearFor Him who gave and holds my lifeIn many a sacrafize I'm call to shareOften to leave my Sons, my Daughters, and my wifeO my Father shield them with thy powerBehold their earnest prayers which mount on highLet Heavens watchers guard their silent bowerAnswer their prayers and note their evry sighTheir faith thou hast ever seenTheir sufferings Thou alone dost KnowNone but Thee can tell what all their trials have beenSince they were wandering pilgraims here belowO my Father guard them through all time to comeLet their days and years be lengthend outO call them not to leave my earthy homeBut make a Heaven of my humble cotMay they fulfill all their visit hereAs did their LORD then rise to reignInthroned in glory beyound the reach of fearOr sickness sorrow death or painO! God forgive the past keep me from future IllLet light, wisdom, truth and virtue fill my heartPrepare me for that glory which doth the Heavens fillFrom the most holy anointed vows may I never partO give me power to honor those noble treasures givenAs the first pillars to build my Kingdom onHelp me to firmly stand with them in HeavenThat I may prove a true and faithful sonThen I will reign with my Dear wife and Children toWith Joseph and Hiram and all of Abrams seedI'll shout Hosannah to God and the Lamb with all who goFrom their graves with the redeemed of our DEAD

And I find [FIGURE] Gold from the publications of the day that the signs ofthe times are fulfilling many of the ancient as well asmodern Revelations and Prophesies. Thrones are castdown, all governments of the Earth are tottering from theirfoundations Anarchy & confuscion are begining to reign, Hatredstrife and war are begining to be poured out upon the childrenof men. In the midst of this order of things, the Latter Day Saints discover vast quantities of Gold at the base ofthe mountains of Israel in the valley of the sacramento inupper Calafornia. And not ownly the people of the UnitedStates but of other nations ketch the sound of Gold Gold &tens of thousands are rushing forward evry way in theirpower to get to the gold country as a horse would rush tobattle, but the amount of Gold, silver, coper &c discoverdin that Country indicates that the worldd of the Lord spok[e]by Isaiah will be fulfilled, when He says that "for Brass Hewill bring Gold, for Iron I will bring silver, for wood brassfor stones Iron,["] &c truly this is an age big with EventsCompanies are forming in all most all parts of the UnitedStates and ships in all our ports prepareing to take the people to the Bay of San Francisco which is ownly 20 milesfrom Capt Sutters Fort whare the Mormon gold digings commencedand It seems as though all the world thought of at the presenttime was to obtain gold. Though the Cholera has commen[ce]dspreading in New York once more, yet the gold panic isso much greater then the fear of the Cholery that it ishardy noticed.Among the letters which I obtained yesterday was one fromO Hyde who informed me that Olover Cowdery had comeback to the Church had made satisfaction and was voted tocome in by the door of Baptism. He was the first man baptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in this lastdispensation, under the hands of Joseph Smith the Prophetbut after being out of the Church eleven years he had nowreturned again, and may the Lord bless him & Keep himsteadfast unto the end.

All the Nations of the Earth at the present timeboth Jew & Gentile Are presenting to the eye of men scenes that wereunlooked ^for^ by the ignorant or learned, the Philosopher, AsstronomerPoet, Divine, Editor, Dr, Lawyier Statesman, President, Ruler KingPrince or Pope, which events are ownly understood by the man of God inspired by the power of God & the gift of the Holy Ghostsuch an one can perfectly understand the present signs of the times.

They are the ownlyones who understand their fulfillment as the events are passingbefore them, or that have cause to rejoice therein, to all othersthe Sequel of the present signs of the Times are hid behind theveil of doubts Darkness and uncertaintyDecember 29, 1848 ~ Friday to December 30, 1848 ~ Saturday29th & 30th We had a heavy snow storm I spent the time reading &writing I perused the New York Herald to Dec 30 which contained inte-resting ite[m]s spoken of in following pagesDecember 31, 1848 ~ Sunday31s Sunday the last day of the year of AD 1848 A synopsis of my Journalwill be found on a following Page 
 THUS ends the Year of eighteen hundred and forty eight A Year big with events, a year in which the fig tree hath rapidly put forth her leaves & blossomed for the summerA year which has lade the foundation for the fulfillment of more Prophesy & Revelation than has been fulfilled in whole centuries in other ages. Thrones have been cast down, whole Kingdoms have been overturned, the power of the Pope of Rom[e] laid prostrate & he driven from his Kingdom. All the nations of the Earth convulsed Revolutions, wars anarchy & confusion follo[w] each other in rapid succession, Cholera, plagues, & famine follow in the train. And last of all though not least in importance ◊is the foundation laid for the disolution of the American Government while these things are going on the Jews are gathe[r]-ing home to rebuild Jerrusalem, some 7000 Latter Day Saint[s] have gatherd into the valley of the mountains of Israel by the Grate Salt Lake, and the Saints of the valley of the Sacramento have discoverd vast quantites of Gold, silver, coper Iron & other mettels the report of which has spread like electricity through through the world which is causing tens of thousands of the world to flock to that place these are some of the features of the signs of 1848 The revolutions of Europe commenced with France. The people rose in mass had 3 days fight, at the end of which they drove Louis Philipi King of the French out of France with all the Royal family the People entered the Turrelles took the Throne upon their shoulders carried it into the streets & dashed it to peaces upon the ground. The people then undertook to esstablish a republican government, it was said to be ownly 500 killed in the first 3 days fight Afterwords a reaction took place with a fight & some 15000 killed, they have finally organized, and the world are now looking Daily for the account of their electing a President and it is expected by many that much blood will be shed on the occasion in consequence of the many conflicting Parties. The Jerman States and Prusia next follow in Revolution which is still unsetled. Next the People of Austria arose and Drove the King from his Throne & Kingdom He afterwards returned with Armies and bombarded Vienna 8 days and regained his Kingdom but has been driven to the necessit[y] of giving his people a milder form of government & more toleration still his Throne is in danger. The Emperor of Rusia has had much war and his Throne is in danger. The Irish have made a Struggle to throw of[f] the Brittish yoak & they have failed yet deep trouble is brewing for that nation. The inhabitants of Rome have risen up in their strength and compelled the pope to make change after change, and at last have dashed his power to the Earth assassinated his Councellors and Driven him from his Papal seat which has never before been shaken for the last fourteen hundreds years and he has had to seek prot-ection by fleeing to other Nations. While this is going on in for-eign Countries let us turn our eyes for a moment to the Positionof Blood Stained America. A Nation though blessed above all other Nations under Heaven yet she has of late been guilty of sheding the Blood of Apostles Prophets Patriarchs and Saints she has suffered mob rule to take the place of Constitution law & order and what position is she in at the Close of this year, not ownly one of herstates Ohio has disgraced herself by having a legislaton sit for 
 weeks & spend their time in fighting for the mastery instead of organizing & doing the business of the people, but the leaders of the whole Nation itself at Washington are engender[ing] the spirit of party strife, hatred disunion & war meeting in seperate parties and laying plans for the dissolving of the Union and the anhilation of the American Government. And James Gordon Bennett of the New York Herald & other Editors after Prophesying month after month that their was no danger of disolving our union are with all their prophesies recorded in their paper stareing them in the face, under the necessity of recording the account of the parties ways and means made use of to accomplis & bring to pass the varythings they have been prophesying against. And while the Senators & Statesman of the Slave states meet in convention and resolve that if slavery in the Distrect of Columbia is abolished or prohibited from New Mexico or Calafornia that they will immediately dissolve the Union, lay taxes upon the shiping of the free States &c At the same time Citizens and Statesmen of the free states meet in conven-tion and Resolve if these things are not done they in like manner will dissolve the Union. While these parties are growing more & more determined, & further & wider apart. Still the public mind seems to be blinded as to the result of these resolutions, and are ignorant concerning the fruit which will be produced by the seed ofthere own sowing yes they have "eyes but see not, ears but hear not & hearts but do not understand" while the servent of God wfilled withinspiration, can behold the scene in its true light and knows well the result, with as much certainty as Noah, Lot, and Jesus, did each in their day while gazing upon the conduct of the Anted-eluvians, Sodom & Gomorrow, or the inhabitants of Jerrusalem and as the words of the Lord were fulfilled in the former case in like manner will they in the latter. [##Matthew 13:15##] During the past year the Asiactic cholera one of the plagues of the last days has also again commenced its march through the Earth slaying its tens of thousands. it has now made its appearance in England & Scotland and has just arived in the United States is in New York New Orleans Mobeal Memphis and Cincinnati the last report states about 100 daily in New Orleans the signs of the gathering of the Jews has been vary prominant during the past [year], the governments of the world have in some measure been exherted to favor that people. And while I turn my eye towards ZionI can see the Lord is favoring her. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints has been organized with a first Presidency of three viz Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, and Willard Richards, who have gatherd to the mountains of Israel in the valley of the Great Salt Lake took with them about 3000 souls & some 8000 head of cattle of all kinds which now makes a population of about 7000 saints in the City of the Great Salt Lake Great Bason North America. The Saints who were located near the Bay of San Francisco have found a vast amount of welth in mines, such as Dimonds, Gold, Silver, quick silver, platina, copper, lead, tin, zink Iron &c, these things have been found to such an extent that it is creating great excitement throughout the world esspecially in the United States and tens of thousands are flocking to that land.Crime of Evry kinsd has apparently increased 100 per ct throughout the United States and the cup of their iniquity is full and the hour of their Judgment is come Calamity sorrow & Death has recieved its comm-ission to visit this land. And the spirit whispers to me that eighteen hundred & forty nine will lay waste many thousands of the inhabitants of the Earth esspecilly of this land by Cholera fire plage and Judgments

 History of Wilford WoodruffIn traceing the history of my Fathers I find it difficult to obtain a satisfactory account of the Woodruff family (from whom I descended) for more than three generation. I learn from the English Book of Heraldry thatWoodruff supposed to be one of my Ancestors was Lord Mayorof the City of London at the time of the great fire in AD 1649 My Great Grand Father Josiah Woodruff lived nearly one hundred years of age and possessed a strong Iron Constitution and performed a great amount of manual labour nearly up to the time of his death. His wifes name was Sarah. He had by her nine children as follows Josiah, Appleton, EldadElisha, Joseph, Roda, Phebe & 2 names not given. One of his daughters marriedmarried a Chase the other a man by the name of NorthMy Grandfather Eldad Woodruff was the third son of Josiah Woodruff. He was born ^in Farmington Hartford County Connecticut^ in 1751. He like his father possessed a strong constitution it was considered ^said^ that he performed the most manual labor for several years of any man in Hartford County Ct. but from over exertion in hewing timber he had asevere ^was^ attack of the ^with^ rheumatism in his right hip which caused asevere lameness in his righ for several years before his deathHe married Dinah Woodford by whom he had 7 children as followsEldad, Elizabeth, Samuel, Aphek, Titus, Hellen, & Ozem. Eldad Married Lewey Woodford, Elizabeth Amasa Frisby. Samuel Miss Case,Aphek Bulah Thompson, & Azubah Hart. Titus Louisa Allan, Hellen AmosWheeler & Ozem Acksa Merrill & Hannah Hart, all of which had anumerous families of children. My Grand Father died ^in Farmington Ct^ with an attack of the^the^ spotted fever in 1806 aged 55 years. My Grand Mother Dinah Woodruffdied in 1824 ^aged the same place^ in Farmington Ct with a cancer in the left breast. Her sufferings were very great.My Father Aphek Woodruff was born in Farmington Hartford County Ct November 11th 1778.  Married Bulah Thompson who was born 1782 Married Nov 29, 1801by whom he had three children, Azmon, born Nov 29 1802. Ozem Thompson born Dec 22nd 1804. Wilford born March 1st 1807. My Mother Bulah Woodruff died with an attack of the spoted fever June 11th 1808 aged 26 years leaving me 15 months old at her death. My Father married for his second wife Azubah Hart Nov born July 31st 18 1792 Married Nov 9th 1810, by whom he had 6 children 
 watching my footsteps in order to find some opportunity to take my life fromthe Earth but I can ownly attribute the continuation of my life on Earthto the present time to a merciful God whose hand has been streched out & rescuedme from death in the midst of the many dangers and hair breadths escapes which I have passed through in life some of which I will here mentionWhen three years of age I fell into a caldron of boiling water was instantly caught out& so badly scalded that is was 9 months before I was considered out of danger. Whenfive years of age I fell from the great beam of a barn upon my face upon the beam floorwhich came near breaking my neck three months afterwards I broke one of myarms falling down a pair of stairs.  I soon broke the other arm falling out of a high stoop across some timber. When six years of age I came near being killedby a surly bull and was ownly saved as it were by a miracle. During the same yearI went into my Fathers saw mill with several other children I got upon the head blockto take a ride while running the carriage back not anticipating any danger but beforeI was aware of it my leg was caught between the head block & fender post & broakboth bones in two below the knee I was taken to the house & lay 9 hours before mybones was set which time was spent amid severe pain: but being young my bonessoon nit together & in few weeks I was again upon my feet attending to the sports ofmy youth. During my confinement with this lameness my brother Thompson was mycompanion in the same room going through with a course of the typus feverWhen 7 years of age I was riding on the top of a load of hay which my UncleOzem Woodruff was driving to the barn when he turned the load over on top of me and before it was I was nearly strangled for the want of air before it was removedfrom me. While 8 years of age I was riding in a one horse waggon with several others to go to our labor the horse took fright ran down a steep hill and turned us over with the waggon on top of us. But again while in the midst of dangermy life was preserved none of us was seriously injured. While 9 years of age I clumb ^climbed^into an Elim tree to obtain some bark. I steped upon a dry tree limb and I fellabout 15 feet upon my back which apparently beat the breath out of my body a cousinran & told my parents I was dead, before they arrived at the spot I came to my sensesarose upon my feet & met my Parents coming to me. At 12 years of age Iwas drowned in Farmington River & sunk in 30 feet of water and was miraculouslysaved by a young man named Bacon, I suffered much in being restored to lifeAt 13 years of age while passing through Farmington meadows in the depth of winter with the roads drifted with snow and in an exceeding blustering day I became 
 Became so chilled & overcome with cold I could not travel, I crawled into thehollow of a large tree to rest me. A man in the distance seeing me go into ithastened to my ^rescue^ realizeing more fully than I did the danger I was in when he arrivedat the spot I had fallen asleep & was nearly insensible, he had much difficulty inarousing me to a sens of my situation. He procured means to convey me to myFathers house and through a kind profidence my life was again preservedAt 14 years of age I split my left instep open with an ax which went nearly through my foot & ^it^ was 9 months getting well. At 15 years of age I was bitten in my left hand by a mad dog in the last stage of the Hydrophobia. He ownly clampedmy hand with his teeth but did not draw blood and I was preserved throughthe mercy of God from an awful death. At the age of 17 I met with an accidentwhich caused me much suffering & came near ending my life. I was riding a veryill tempered horse which I was not acquainted with, and while going down a very steeprocky hill the horse took the advantage of the ground suddenly leaped from the road & randown the steepest part of the hill amid the thicket & the rocks at full speed and he commencedkicking up at the same time & about landing me over his head among the rocks but I lodgedon the top of his head grasped one hand hold of each ear as with a death grasp expecting evrymoment to be dashed to peaces against the rocks while in this position sitting astride his neckwith no bridle to guide him but his ears he plunged down the hill among the rocks with allforce ^speed^ untill he ran against a rock which dashed him to the Earth I went over his head& the rock about one rod & struck the ground square upon my being the ownly thingvisible that saved my life, for had ^I^ struck upon any othe part of my body it must have killed me instantly, as it was my boenes bones crushed from under me as though theywere reeds. It broke my left leg twice in two & put out both of my ancles in a shocking manner, and the horse came nigh rolling over me in his struggles toget up. ^My uncle Titus Woodruff saw^ An uncle of mine saw me fall, hastened to my relief got amist me && carried me to his house in an arm chair, I lay from 2 oclok till 10 at nightwithout ^medical aid^ assistance then my Father arrived bringing Dr T Swift of Farmington with himwho set my bones boxed up my limbs & carried me in his carriage 8 miles that night to my Fathers house my sufferings were very great yet I had good attention& in 8 weeks I was outdoors upon my cruches & soon was all well againIn 1827 while attending the Flouring Mill attempting to clear the ice out of a waterwheel standing upon the wheel with one arm around the shaft a man hoisted the gatelet a full head of water upon it as soon as the water struck it it stopped my feetsliped into [word covered] I immediately plunged head fore most over the rim of the 
 wheel into about 3 feet of water and my weight drew my legsout of the wheel or I should have been drawn under a shaft & crushed to death. In 1831, while having charge of the Flouring Mill in Collinsv-ville Ct I was standing inside of a breast wheel 20 feet in diameterupon one of the arms near the top clearing out the ice when a full head of water was let onto it it immediately started. I dropped my ax and leapedthrough the wheel to the bottom of it by the shaft & arms about 20 feet as I struckthe bottom of the wheel I was rolled out against a ragged stone well with ownly about 2 feet clearance between it & the wheel the wheel caught me & rolled ^me^ outinto the water below where I found myself without any broken bones but withsome bruises & much fright. ^*see paper apart^ In 1833 the day I was baptized into theChurch of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints one of my horses newly calkedkicked my hat of my head & had he struck 2 inches lower would probably have killed me instantly. In 10 minutes afterwards while driving the same horsesdown a hill on a sled without any box the bottom boards sliped forwardunder the roll caught the ground turned endways fell on the horses badlythrowing me between the horses they ran to the bottom of the hill draging meby the lines head foremost with the steed top of me about rods overa smooth snow path I escaped unharmed however in the midst of both dangersIn 1834, while travelling in Zions Camp to Missouri a rifle was accidentallydischarged & the ball passed through three tents with a dozen men in each & lodgedin a waggon axletree with a man standing against it it injured no one. It passed withina few inches of my breast & many others escaped as narrowly as my selfA few months afterwards a musket was accidentally snaped with the muzzle pointing atmy breast within a few feet of me heavily loaded with buck shot but it missed fireand my life was again preserved.  In April 1839 in Rochester Ill I was ridingupon the running gears of a waggon without any box, I was sitting upon the fore wardaxletree and the bolt came out fastening the cupling pole this left the hind wheels & myweight on the forward bolster & tongue turned the coupling pole clear over onto the horsesbacks, turned the stakes upside down & shut me up fast between the boulster & tonguebut in such a manner that my head & shoulders dragged on the ground my horsestook fright and ran out into an open pari prairie & thus draged me in this positionfor about half a mile when I managed so as to guide them with my left hand so as to to run them into a corner of a high worm fence where we landed in a piletogether, I was considerably bruised but landed withou escaped without any broken bones 
 see paper apart*& after one days rest was enabled to attend to my labors again (see paper apart)Thes I have occupied considerable space in refering to those peculiar circumstanceswhich have attended me during life. And to sum the matter up it stands about thoseI have broaken both legs (one twice in two) both arms, & both ancles ^my breast bone & 3 ribs^ ^my breast bone & 3 ribs^ have been drowned froze & scalded, & bit with a mad dog, have been in two water wheels undera full head of water *  ^have passed through several severe fits of sickness encountered poison in the worst forms, landed in a pile of rail road ruins have bearly missed the passing bullet^ I have passed through a score of other hair breadth escapes &Yet the protection & mercy of God has been over me, and my life there from hasbeen preserved upon the Earth for which blessing I feel to render the gratitudeof my heart to my Heavenly Father praying that the remained of my days may be spentin his service and the building up of his kingdom *) ^It has appeared mirraculous to me that with all the injuries and broaken bones which I have met with with I have^ not a lame limb about me but have ever sincebeen enabled to endure  the ever since the hardest labour and exposures and journies have ^often^ walked 40, 50 and on oneoccasion 60 miles in a dayAt an early age my mind began to be ^was^ exercised upon religious subjects. ButI never made a profession of religion untill 1830, being 23 years of age I did not then join any church ^for the reason that I could not find any^ for the reason body of people or denomination or Church whoshad for their foundation, doctrin, tenets, faith or practice, ^agreed with^ the gospel of Jesus Christ or the ordinances ^&^ gifts & practices which Christ & the Apostles taught  & practiced ^in their day^in there day & generation for the salvation of the children of Man Although the teachers of the day taught that the faith, gifts, graces, miracles, & ordinances which the prophets, Savior & the Apostles enjoyed were done away & no longer needed I did not believe a word of it to be true ownly as they were done away through the unbeliefsof the children of men I believed the same gifts graces miracles & power would be manifest the same in one age of the world as in another when God did have a Church & kingdom upon the Earth, I did not believe that the Church of Christ did exist upon the Earth in an organized form, but I believed there had been a falling awayfrom the Apostolic order of things,  but that the Church & kingdom of God would beesstablished upon the Earth in my day & generation and that I should live to see it. This principle was rivited upon my mind from two causes 1st from the perusal of the Old & New Testament with fervent prayer that the Lord would show me what was right & wrong & lead me in the path of salvation, without any regard to the opinions of man& the whisperings of the spirit of the Lord unto me for the space of three years did teach ^taught^me in accordance with the ^written^ word of God that He was about to set up his Church & Kingdom upon the Earth in the last days ^and that his "righteousness was about to be revealed & his salvation to come forth"^ ^as said the Prophet Isaiah in his 56 chapter^ And secondly I was taught this principle from my youthup to manhood by an aged man by the name of Robert Mason who lived in Simsbury Ct who was frequently called the old prophet Mason, ^who taught^ who did teach me many things which are now coming to pass. He prophesied of many of those events which are now takeplace. He did not believe that any man upon the Earth in the midst of the Christian Nations 
 ^Had authority^ to administer in the ordinances of the House of the Lord but believed that it was ourprivilege through faith, prayer, & fasting to heal the sick, & cast out devils by the laying on of hands which was the case under his administration as numbers could testify.I was living in this state of mind & in this faith & belief looking for the coming forth ofthe Church of Christ when I heard of what was called Mormonism. In 1832 Iwas loudly called upon by the spirit of the Lord to go to the state of Rhode Island one ofmy brother ^Asahel^ was also called to go to the same place & at the same time when we metwe both told our feelings & what the spirit of the Lord had whispered unto us & we marvelled & wondered what the Lord wanted of us in Rhode Island, but as we had made preparations to move to the west we let outward circumstances controll us, and like Jonah instead of going to Ninivah went to Tarshis, so we instead of going to Rhode Island went to Richland Oswego CountyN. York, and there remained until the 29 day of Dec 1833 before I heard a gospel sermonby a latter day saint.  I then soon learned what the Lord wanted of us in Rhode Islandfor at the time we were commanded ^warned^ of the Lord to go there, two of the Elders of the Latter daySaints were preaching there & had we gone we certainly should have embraced thework at that time, but as it was we had to wait for the next callOn the 29th day of Dec 1833, Elder Zera Pulsipher & Elijah Cheeny calledat my house & gave out an appointment for preaching in the school house in thatneighborhood that [illegible] evening I attended as did my brother Azmon WoodruffWe both believed, invited the Elders to our home & offered ourselvesfor baptism the first sermon we heard. We read the Book of Mormon& had a testimony that it was true. And on the 31 day of Dec 1833 I wasbaptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints under the handsof ^by^ Elder Zera Pulsipher & confirmed the same evening under his handsOn the 2nd day of January 1834 I was ordained to the office of a teacher& my eldest brother Azmon Woodruff an Elder & a small branch organizedof 12 members all under the hands of ^by^ Elder Pulsipher. In the month of FebruaryI walked in company with Elder Holton some 60 miles to the town of Fabeus to attend an evening meeting of the Saints in that place where Elder Pulsipher was presiding. here ^I^ saw for the first time the Book of Commandments or revelations given through Joseph Smith and I believed them with all my heart & rejoiced therein & after spending two days with them we returned home rejoicing several days with them &holding several meetings we returned home rejoicing. During the winter we were visited by several of the Elders among whom ^was^ Elder Harry Brown in February. He again called upon us about the first of February ^1834^ accompanied by Elder Parley P. Pratt it being the first 
 time I had ever seen him  we appointed a meeting for him to speak to ourlittle branch, ^He instructed [illegible] us the branch^ and we had a precious time, he spoke till near midnight. He was uponan important mission in connexion with Lyman Wight, it was to gather up from100 to 5000 men ^a company^ to go up to redeem Zion. I accompanied Brother Pratt to Jefferson County, I told him my circumstances. He said it was my duty to try to prepare myself to go to Kirtland & join the Camp of Zion. According to his council I went to withall my might & settelled all my accounts ^business^ & business and on the 11 day of April1834 I bid my friends farewell, & took a pair of horses & waggon & took withme Brothers Harry Brown & Warren Ingles, & started for Kirtland Ohio.I met with Orson Pratt, John Murdoch, and other Elders on the way & arrived in Kirtland on the 25th of April 1834, where I f was introduced to the prophet Josephthe first time I had ever seen him. He invited me to make his house my homewhich kind offer I excepted of & staid with him about one week. I have forthe first time became acquainted not ownly with the Prophet Joseph & his family butwith many of the High Priests, Elders & Saints which I had never before seenI spent one Sabbath in Kirtland & heard many of the ^leading^ Elders speak & I felt to rejoice before God for the light & knowledge which was manifest to me during that daythrough the preaching of the Elders of Israel. According to appointment I left Kirtlandupon the 1st day of May with a part of the company went to New Portagewhere we remained untill all the company came up joined us, from Kirtland & wewere organized.  Then on the 7th day of May we took up our march like the Childrenof Israel pitching our tents by the way, & travelled to Missouri according tothe account already spoken of in the Church History, which was called ^the Camp of^ ZionsCamp which went up to redeem Zion & assist those persecuted brethren.Our whole journey, manner of travelling, incidents upon the way, the way the Lord fought our battles with hail & storm, at Crooked River, the visitation of the cholera toour camp, the death & burial of the Saints &c has all been published in the ChurchHistory. we arrived After we had pitched our tents in Clay County Missouri^our numbers being 205^ & many of the Brethren had been taken sick & some had died Joseph requested the camp to dispersed except enough to take care of the sick all who had teams were required to leave the ground & go among the brethren I went to Brother Lyman Wights in company with Heman Hyde & Milton Holmes. After a few daysJoseph called the ^Brethren^ people to gather at Lyman Wights and told the people ^them^ if they would humble themselves before the Lord & covenant to keep His commandments & obey his council the plague should be stayed from that hour, & their should not be another 
 case of cholera in the camp. The people ^brethren^ covenanted to do this & the plague was stayed & there was not another case in camp. Joseph held several meetingswith the ^Saints^ Saint Set them in order, & ^President Joseph Smith^ returned home with many other of the brethrenI remained with Lyman Wight laboring with my hands till the following winter. * ^(*see paper apart & page 9th)^At a meeting of the High Council at Lyman Wights in Clay County MissouriI was ordained to the office of a Priest * ^* By the direction of the High Council under the hands of Brother Simeon Carter on the 5 day of Nov 1834^ in I had a great desire in myheart to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ to my fellow men for I saw suchblessings, beauty & glory in it that I had a great desire to assist my brethrenin proclaiming it to the inhabitants of the Earth t and this desire continuedto increase upon me, but I did not reveal my feelings to any man, but soon^(the above lines are in paper apart {[shorthand?]} 32)^after I was ordained to the office of a priest I received an ^appointment^ mission by BishopEdward Partridge to go in connexion with Elder Harry Brown on a missionthrough the Southern part of Missouri & through the Arkansas, into the SouthernStates Agreeable to ^my^ this appointment I bid my brethren farewell in ClayCounty & on the 13th day of January 1835 I took my valise in hand weighing15 lbs mostly Books of Mormon & started in company with Elder Harry ^Brown^ withoutwithout purse or scrip & crossed the ferry ^river^ into Jackson County, * ^* as we stepped onto the bank two horsmen le^a^d there horses onto the bank they eyed us very closely but said^ ^nothing to us^ we stopped southopen our mission This was the first & last time that we ever trod the soil ofJackson County, we felt thankful for the privilege & we bowed our knees beforethe Lord & offered up the gratitude of our hearts unto our Father in heaven forthe privilege & prayed for his protection whi from the mob while going throughthe county as the Saints had just been driven out and ^as^ a Latter Day Saint perriledhis life to found in the county, we prayed that the judgments of God mightrest upon the wicked who had shed the blood of the Saints in that land that theirblood might be avenged & that the land might be cleansed from sin wicked-ness & abominations & redeemed that the Saints might again inherit itwe arose & went on our way rejoiceing. I had in my possessiona petition to the Governor of Missouri for redress of wrongs done us in Jackson County for the purpose of obtaining signat[ure] unto it we bent our way south through Jackson County without any harm yet in one instance we were miraculously preserved from a large mob ^of about 60^ assembled at a grog shop which we had to pass. On the 18th Jan we called at the Harmony Mission had an interview with the president of the mission a Presbyterian minister, it was near sun downhe would neither give us any thing to eat nor keep us because we were mormonsit was 15 miles to the nearest house which was an ^Jerrews^ Indian traiding house kept 
 kept by a Mr Jerrew, we asked the minister to direct us there. He gave us directi^directions^ the Spirit said to me that he was decieving us, directeing us wrong, I asked the question3 times over & he declaired he was telling us the truth we followed his direction& it led us into the Osage River swamp where we were lost in the darkness of the night ^we undertook to follow the river but it being about the crookedest one in earth America we made but slow progress^ ^and^ after travelling through mud & water for one hour we concluded to go out onto the open prairie & lide lie down in the grass untill morning but when we got out into the prairie we h[e]ard the Osage Indians drum & shout at the trading houseas they were having a powwow we followed by the sound, & went intotheir midst * ^*as we approached we were met by a dozen large savage looking dogs they smelt of us in a friendly manner^ ^but did not try to bite nor bark we arrived about midnight, covered with mud hungry and weary^ we were kindly received by Mr Jerrew fed & lodged for the night19th Mr Jerrew gave us a good breakfast set us across the Osage River^(see paper apart 2nd page 10)^in a canoe & was started upon our long days walk it being 60 miles to the nearest house in the direction we were going ^and we had not a morsel of anything with us to eat^ Most of our travels through the day wasthrough prairie before dark we entered timber timber land as we were approachingthe timber a large black bear came out of the timber & met us we had no weapons but a small pistol but as the bear got within about 6 rods of us herose upon his hind feet & examined us a short time & turned & went offanother course we travelled on as fast as we could we were soon invelloped in so thick darkness it was with great difficulty that we could keep the road we weresoon surrounded with a large drove of wolves who ^that^ kept up a continual howling& would freequently rush upon us & come up within a few feet of us we travelledabout one two hours in this situation feeling that we were in danger we concluded to stop & build a fire & wait till morning. Accordingly we built a large fire which drove the wolves of & as we were about to lie down we h[e]ard a dog bark & also a bell, we found we were near a house we took each of us a brand of fire & in going about one quarter of a mile we found a ^log hut about 12 feet square^ house occupied by one Mr. Williams who was in Jackson County during the mobing of the Saints, & he had lately moved to this place depending upon his gun mostly for his living it being 60 miles to a house on the north of him, & 12 miles on the southHe and his family was living in a small old log house ^hut^ about 12 feet square & one bed in the room upon which lay his wife several children & 3 young dogs. He lay stretched out upon the ^bare^ floor with his feet to a small fire there was no door to the house but a ragged quilt hung up in the door way, it was past 11 oclock at night I turned away the quilt looked into the house every thing was in sound sleepI spoke 3 times no one stired not even a dog, I walked in & laid my hand upon the mans shoulder the mo & spoke to him the moment he felt the wait of my hand he leaped to his feet & commenced running around the room leaping as high 
 as he could each jump. I told him not to be frightened as we were travellers & friends & did not wish to hurt him but wished to stop with him himover night, when he came to his senses we as he gave us permission to stop with him till morning if we would take the bare floor as he did thenwe excepted, we asked for something to eat as we had walked 60 miles with[out] eating a morsel of food. He said he had nothing for us said that hed had got to kill game for his breakfast in the morning. He said the cause of his fright was hehe had shot a large panther dead a few nights before standing in his door, & he thought his mate had lit upon him. We lay down upon the bear floor & we were  glad of this place as it soon began to rain & rained hard through the nightwe arose in the morning & went on in the rain 12 miles to a Mr Connerswho was also in the Jackson County mob who gave us a breakfast but damned us while we were eating because we were mormons & when we had finished a hearty breakfast we thanked him very politely for it and went our way and left him swareing ^We did feel thankful for it for we had walked 72 miles without any thing food but very little^^see page apart 2 page 11^We continued travelling preaching by the way without stoping ownly over night, ^or on the^ ^Sabbath^ untillwe got to Petty John Creek in the Arkansas Territory. Here Mr Allexander Akeman resided with a large family of sons & one daughter all of which we settelled around him Mr Akeman was a member of the Church in Jackson County & a part of his family, his wife died strong in the faith in Missouri,his whole family was mobed some of his sons were whiped severly. But he could not stand the persecution & the loss of his property. He moved to Arkansasto get rid of mormonism had apostitised & was bitter against the work, when we called upon him he opposed us strongly, spoke against the leaders of the Church & the Book of Mormon. He had one son who received us & had a little faith I had a dream the night before I went there what we should meet with& what would transpire. ^relate the dream^ When we met with opposition not ownly by Mr Akemanbut from many in the neighborhood Elder Brown wished to leave the place immediately& continue his journey I told him I should stay & see my dream fulfilledwe staid in the neighborhood 25 days during which time the Lord brought judgmentupon those who had threatened to mob us & take our lives many of them died suddenlywhile we were there and I was warned three times of the Lord to go with MrAkeman & bear testimony unto him of the truth of Mormonism & the wickednessof his course in opposing it & the last time I called upon ^him^ he was filled with wrath against me & when I left his house he followed me in a rage apparently with some evil intent when a few rod I had got a few rods from his door he was nearly treading upon my heels he fell dead at my feet as though he had been struck with a thunder bolt ^lightning^. He immediately began to swell & turned black 
 this created a great wailing & mourning with his famil, Brother Brown & myself assisted the family in laying him out & burying him. He died on the 14th day of Feb 1835 & we buried him on the 16. This clo singulardispensation of providence brought solemnity upon the people & they began to reflect &wished to hear preaching, we held several meetings & preached to the people webaptized a Mr Hubbel & his wife aged people who had opened their doors & given us a home & just as we had got the people prepared to receive the Gospel & anxious to learn & pleading with us to stay & preach, Brother Brown resolved that he would continue his journey south. I was fully satisfied that should we stop we should build up a Church, & I was convinced it was our duty to stop but Brother Brown held the office of an Elder I a priest& we were travelling together upon a mission, & I felt that I must subjectto those over me in the priesthood, so I submitted.  This is an error which many have committed in this Church who were sent as missionaries to theworld, as soon as they get doors open & a people prepared to receive the gospelthey go away & leave them we left this people with tears in their eyes we left& Brother Brown did not baptize another person during his whole southernmission we left them on the 2nd day of March went upon the bank of the Arkansas River cut down a large cotton wood tree dug out a canoe 4 feet wide 12 feet long put on a pair of oars & rowed down the Arkansas River 125 miles to Little Rock geting ^beging^ our food by the way a meal at a timeas we had an opportunity, after visiting Little Rock we tied up our canoe ^travelled down the river 10 miles^ on below Little Rock & tied up our canoe on the East Bank & stoped with a Mr Jonespreached next day at his house on the 16 left our canoe with Mr Jones walked back ^the East Bank of the Arkansas River & started on foot to ward & wade the Mississippi^^Swamp to Memphis Tennessee we travelled on the old military road it was over 200miles the way we travelled ^up the river 10 miles took the old^ ^the road^ & almost the whole distance was knee deep in mud &water up the river 10 miles opposite Little Rock & took the old military road & started to waid the missippi swamp which was mostly covered with water from Little Rock Arkansas to Memphis Tennessee, a distance of about 175 miles, we waided through mud & water knee deep day after day & in some instances40 miles per day before we could get a stoping place. On the 24th while in the swamp I had an attack of the rheumatism & could not travel but slowMy companion Brother Brown had got in a hurry & wished to hasten to the Missippi River take boat close up his mission, take boat & returnto his family in Kirtland, & as I could not travel as fast as he wished so we parted to meet no more for about 3 years he left me siting on a log in the mud & water I being lame & unable to walk & no food & 12 miles to the 
 nearest house on the road. He went out of sight in great haste I then knelt down in the water & prayed the Lord to heal me up & the spirit of the Lord rested upon me & I was healed the pain left me I arose & went my way ^*^ whenever I met with one or more families I preached to them & bore my testimony as I went alone to the people I arrived at the Missippi River& crossed it in the evening of the 27th March 1835 [FIGURE](*^after^ that night that ^after^ Brother Brown left me in trying to travel in the night to me he losthis ^way^ got into a thicket of brambles & tore nearly all of his cloths off from himHe stoped at a cabin & took him nearly all night to mend up his clothes)[FIGURE] I stoped for the night at a publick house kept by Mr Josiah Jackson I was [illegible]up for ^of being^ an imposture Mr Jackson believed I was one of Murrells clan ^instead of a Mormon preacher^ who wasthen murdering & stealing Negroes through the country & to test the thing he gathered to gether a large house full of the the wickedest & most corrupt J Gentry in the city& set me to preaching, to them, to test whether I could preach or not. I do notthink that Mr Jackson or the same company of men & women will ever meet to gether again for the same purpose to test whether a Mormon Elder could preach ornot for they would not like again to have their sins & abominations revealed to each other as plainly & pointedly as I told them that night through the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, they seemed glad to get rid of me upon almost any terms,I travelled from Memphis to Middle Tennessee. And on the 4th of AprilI met with Elder Warren Parish at Father Frys in Benton County ^Middle^ TennesseeHe & David Patten had been labouring to gether through the winter in Tennessee they had baptized some 20 or 30 persons Elder Patten had returned to Kirtland at that timebefore I arrived. I joined Elder Parrish & we laboured to gether ^over 3 months^ and continued*^and travelled & preached daily baptizing such as would receive our testimony on the 23rd of June^^we received a letter from Oliver Cowdery saying that they wished ^Elder^ Parrish to come to Kirtland & for me to remain^^to take charge of the Southern Churches & the Lord would bless me in so doing^to extend our labourse through Tennessee & Kentucky, Elder Warren Parrish ordainedme to the office of an Elder. On the 28th day of June at Father Frys EagleCreek Benton County Tennessee  we baptized some 40 persons while labouring to gether& on the 23rd of July ^1835^ I parted with Elder Parish also returned to KirtlandThis left me alone in my labours in the South. I continued to travel alonethrough the year & extended my labours both in Kentucky & Tennessee I baptized 43 persons during this season 31 after Brother Parrish left meOn the 15 day of Nov while traveling about 12 miles in the night with severallof the Brethren among whom was Brother Benjamin Clapp, a tremendous storm of wind & rain over took us it was exceeding dark we bacame lost in a forest & wecrossed a dangerous stream some 20 times we had a creek to cross, the rain^stream^ had swollen to such an extent by the rain that we could not cross without 
 swimming our horses & several of the company were females & could not consistentlycross the stream he and we undertook to head the stream so that we could crosssufficient to ford it, but in in the attemp in the midst of the darkness of the night& the raging of the wind & rain we became lost in the thick woods we had neither fire,light, or road, but was in the darkness, rain, wind, mud, creeks, & treetops we crossed the stream near twenty times & setting aside our females & horses we made more the appearanceof fishermen than travelers. I thought of Paul's perils by water but the Lord was merciful unto us in the midst of our troubles, for while we were gropeing with in the darkness like the blind for the wall suffering under the pelt cold ^bursts^ & pelting ^hail^ floodsof wind & rain ^of the storms^ & runing the risk of killing both ourselves & animals by riding off steep bluffs, a bright light suddenly shone around about us & revealed untous our perilous situation as were upon the edge of a deep gulf, the light continued with us untill we found a house & got put upon ^learned^ the right road then the light disappeared the darkness returned yet we were enabled to reach the house of Brother Henry Thomas at 9 oclock in the evening, without any harm having rode 20 milesbeing 5 hours in the storm, having forded creeks or [krakes] twenty or moretimes but neither male or female murmured but ^and^ felt to thank God for our preservationoftenI received a letter from Oliver Cowdery at the time that  Warren Parrish was called home.

This grieved Joseph to theheart to have to pass through such perils among fals brethren. But notwithstandingthis thick cloud of darkness which hung over Kirtland Joseph ^He^ remained unmovedin the cause of God and was determined to magnify his calling and leave the evilin the hand of God.

SidneyRigdon followed him as he did several others and sustained him in his positionWarren Parrish spoke against him in the bitterness of his heart as had some of thetwelve before, but the people could discern the difference of the spirit between Joseph andhis enemies.

Mr Benjamin Kent piloted us to the place ^Baptist Meeting House^  when we arrived^occupied by Elder Gideon J Newton pastor of the ownly religious denomination upon the Island. At the^at the door the meeting had begun, I sent for the Deacon who came to the doorsI told him I wished him to inform the minister that there was two servants ^we were servants^ of God at the door who ^and^ wished to deliver a message to that people. He sent wordfor us to come into the pulpit accordingly with valiece in hand we walkedup into the pulpit and took a seat one on each side of him, whenhe closed his discourse he asked me what hour we would like to speakto the people I told him at 5 oclock he gave out our appointment andinvited us to his house to take tea we accepted the invitation on arriving at his house I asked how many school houses there was on the Island hesaid four ^4^ ^four^ and gave me their names ranging from West to East I asked him 
 if they were free for any one of to preach in. He said yes I tookout my Bible, Book of Mormon, & Doctrin & Covenants and laid themall upon his stand he took them up and examined them but asked noquestion ^but said said he said would read them^ the hour of meeting arrived, the house was full I preached tothe people upon the first principle of the gospels and bore testimony that theLord had raised up a prophet and had commenced to establish hisChurch and Kingdom again upon the Earth in fulfillment of the word of God or spoken through the Ancient Prophets and Apostles this was the firstdiscourse ever delivered by any latter Day Saint upon this chain of Islands Elder Hale bore testimony to the truth of what I had said I gave liberty to all presentto make any remarks no one spoke, at the close of the meeting I gave out anappointments for preaching in the four school houses for the next four following eveningsthe people came out in mass to investigate the principles which we taught the first^in^ 14 days of our stay upon the Island we preached 19 discourses. I thus openeda door for baptisms when Capt Justice Ames and his wife came forwardand were baptized by Elder Hale being the first baptized upon those IslandsElder Newton the Baptist Minister with his family attended about a dozen of the ^twelve^first of our meetings, read the Books, and was convinced by the spirit of the Lordthat our Doctrin was true and he had a hard struggle for days in his mindto know which to do either to receive or reject it. He finally resolved toreject it and took a stand against us. He commenced preaching against usalso sent for Mr Douglass the Methodist Minister on the South Island to come overand help him he had been long at variance with Mr Douglas but they now madefriends and united in a war against us but they did not stop the work of Godwe continued preaching daily untill we baptized most of the members of MrNewtons, Church, and those who owned the meeting house. I then followedMr Douglass home to his own Island and commenced preaching to hisChurch and baptized a good share of his members ^A number of those that we baptized were^ they also sent for other^sea Captains,^ Ministers from the Main Land who came over and tryed to put a stop to the workby preaching and lying about us but the work continued to roll on they wishedme to work a miracle to convince them that my Doctrine was true, I told themthey had rejected the truth and they would see signs but not unto Salvation

I laboured mostly upon those Islands during^I labored here during^ the winter of 1837 & 8, and as nearly evry person oupon those Islands had over 10 yearsold had attended my meetings and investigated the principles of mormonism the peoplebegan to ^and^ take sides either for or against, ^us^ and our enemies would gather together attimes to try ^made attempts^ to break up our meetings, while holding a meeting on the NorthIsland. On the evening of the 15 Jan 1838 a company of sailors belonging to theUnited States Revenue Cutter whose business it was while coasting to protect theLives and Liberties of all American citizens as far as they could they hauledon shore a panel of cannon ^Brought on shore^ a swivel and joined the mob and paraded nearthe house where I was speaking ^preaching^ and discharged it several times followed by smallerarms with the intention of breaking up our meeting, but it ownly caused me to preach the longer and louder as some of the mob gathered around to see what effectit would have I warned them in the name of the Lord, and proclaimed the judgmentsof God that awaited the wicked and I shook my garments in the presence of the peopleand told them I was clear of their blood and ^but^ they heard my voice and wordsownly when mingle with the roar of Cannon and musketry, before I had donespeaking they went back on board of the Revenue Cutter taking their arms with ^them^having accomplished nothing ownly showing the wickedness of their hearts, and burningup some powder and grass. at the close of the meeting I baptized 2, also one nextday and while baptizing the mob again commencing^d^ fireing guns but being loaded with 
 nothing but powder they were harmless. The Baptist and Methodist joinedthe mob, ^originated got up^ and tried to stir up the people and lied about us more than proved for theirbenefit.  Mr Douglass the methodist priest on the South Island ^when argument found him^ applyed to the ^to all the^ magistrates for a warrants against me for a lie bill for overthrowing his doctrin but ^they refused to grant them as he had no^ their was not a magistrate on the Islands would issue one to him.^cause of complaint but religious persecution^On the 13th Feb 1838 I left the Islands I crossed in the mail boat to Hampden onthe main Land. I there met with ^ordained^ James Townsend I set him apart to the ministryand we walked together through deep snows to the City of Bangor, preaching eachnight and visited and preached in the Town of searsmont, Belfast, NorthportFrankfort Hampden, and twice in the City Hall in Bangor, to large assemblies, andreturned to the ^Fox^ Islands via Casteme and the Isle of Holt, arived in Vinal Haven the8th March ^Elder Townsend returned home^.

On the 4th April I called at the post office and Mr Kent the post mastershowed me a letter containing two sheets of fools cap signed by Warren Parrishand several of the Twelve who had apostitized and been cut off from the Church theletter was teeming with falshood against Joseph Smith and the Prophet and all that stoodby him it was sent with the intention to of breaking up the work upon these Islands but it did not injure have the do accomplish it or hinder the work.On the 11th April I was visited by Elder Townsend and Milton Holmes whoattended the conference with me upon both Islands and bore their testimony to thepeople, but the spirit of opposition increased to a great hights, untill I felt warnedby the spirit to leave the Island for a season and take a western mission. after visitingthe saints from house to house, and praying with them and incouraging them I leftthem on the 28th April and went to the main land with Elder Holmes & Townsend Mrs Woodruff ^Mrs Woodruff^ had returned to her friends in Scar Fathers house on the 17th April We walkedto Scarborough, I left Scarborough May 7th walked to Bradford where I leftElder Holmes, I walked to Boston and on the 11th I had an appointment to preached at Sister Vose room. But I went to Cambridgeport to visit Elder A. P. Rockwoodwho had been shut up in jail on pretense of debt but in reality out of persecution thejailer shut ^locked^ me in and did not let me out till 10 oclock at night but while it 
 disappointed a congregation of people it gave me a happy visit with Elder Rockwoodin conversing upon the work of God if we were ^although^ in Jail, it was the first time I had evermet with him. On my return to Boston the people were still waiting to hearme speak though at a late hour, I spoke to them a short time. On the 14 I left Boston and walked some 30 miles to Hollistown to Deacon Havens and preached, I walked to Providence RI, took steamer to New York arived on the 18 Met with Br OrsonPratt and attended meetings with him ^un^till the 27.

Ond On the first day of July I baptizedsix persons in Farmington river including my Father, step Mother, and ^my ownly^ sister UnisEunice, also cousin Seth Woodruff and aunt Anna Cossett, and Dwight Webstera Methodist class Leader who was boarding at my Fathers house. When Father Jthe Patriarch Joseph Smith sen gave me my blessing he said I should bringmy Fathers household into the Kingdom of God, I felt that it had been fulfilled thisday. I confirmed those baptized and organized this small branch of the Churchconsisting of 9 members 8 of which were relatives, I ordained Dwight Websterto the office of a Priest and administered the sacrament unto them. On the 3rd of Julyafter committing myself father Aphek Woodruff and his household into the hands of GodI bid them farewell and again ^I^ started for the state of Maine.

On the 9 Aug I received a letter from Thomas B Marsh informing meof my appointment to fill the place in the Quorum of the Twelve of one who had fallenand I was requested to come to Far West as soon as possible to prepare for a missionto England in the spring. I immediately visited all the Saints upon both Islandsand earnestly exhorted them to sell their property and prepare themselves to accompanyme to the body of the Church in Missouri. Several immediately sold their propertybut many were poor and had not the means to. Brother Nathaniel Thomas said he would furnish means to help off all the poor saints upon Fox Islands who wishedto go, and for this purposes went with me to the main land ^on the 13th Aug^ and I assisted him 
 in procuring about two thousand d ollars worth of horses, waggons, tents &c for the company. He paid about $1,500 of the expens himself $1,000 of which was to furnishconveyance for the poor after purchasing the outfit for the company and urging the importanceof their starting as soon as possible not later than the first of Sept. On the 19th AugI left thesaints ^upon the Islands^ returned to town of Camden where we had prepared our outfit and returnedto Scarborough to prepare my own family for the journey, expecting to see the company infew days but here I remained in great suspens untill the 1st Oct when Elder Townsendwent to meet the company. They arived in Scarborough on the 3rd Oct with theirwaggon covers all flying. The company stoped at the house of Sister Sarah B Fosswe went to work nailed down all the covers and painted them and made them waterproof. And in the after noon of the 4th Oct 1838 ^with^ my wife bid her Father Mother &friends fare well ^and with her child two month and a half old in the first stage of the hooping cough^ and we [FIGURE] started upon our journey. The company consisted of53 persons including Brother Townsend & family and myself and family we had 10 waggonsa pair of horses to each waggon, we had now ^before us at this late period^ commenced this gloo 4th day of Oct^Before us^ to start upon a gloomy land journey of two thousand miles from Maine to Missouriwe continued to travel from day to day to day through all the rain, mud, cold, frost, andsnow, untill I arived in Rochester, Sangamont Co Illinos, on the 19th day of Dec.where I stoped and setled my family and company for the winter. My wife hadpassed through a severe course of the brain fever and her s while upon the journeyand her sufferings had been very great her spirit had left her body twice to allhuman appearance and ownly been called back through the prayer of faith and the power ofGod. Our child had also been very sick and I had become so thoroughly chilled through my whole system ^in crossing the bleak prairies^ ^*Brother Thomas had buried one child and^ that it was two months after I stoped before I got sufficiently thawednearly all the company had been sick through their exposures some of them had stoped by the wayout and warmed up to feel natural. ** We continued travelling untill we were obliged toside we had wallowed through much mud and snow had broaken several axeltrees, andstop in consequence of the bad roads and cold weather, I spent the remainder of^we suffered much upon the journey yet &^the winter laboring with my ^hands^ for the support of my family. On the 8th day of March1839 I attended a conference at Springfield Ill. their was present 8 seventies6 Elders 3 priest and 1 Deacon, several were presented on ordination, we ordained2 Elders & one priest. Brother Brewster was presented for ordination and BrotherDunham strongly urged that he be ordained as did several others. I strongly objected to itfor I felt that the spirit the man possessed was not of God, a strong influence wasgot up in his favor in Springfield, I called a vote of the Elders upon the subject andall voted for him to be ordained except 3 of us two besides myself he thencame foreward d and demanded baptism ^ordination^ at my hands ^in the name of Jesus Christ^ I told him he shouldnot be ordained by my consent, for that was not the way God imparted the Holypriesthood to the children of man he was not ordained and I marvelled that somany should have voted for his ordination after seeing the spirit he manifested

Once was while in council with the presidencyand Twelve. my strength left me my breath stoped and I felt as though I was struck withdeath it was with great difficulty that I was brought to by the laying on of hands. aftermy recovery I continued my labours in the printing office. ^Sept 24^ The office took firein the upper story in the midst of a large amount of paper and it came near burning ^up^it to the ground.

On my return home in the fallas the printing office was out of stock I procured means and purchased astock of ^a supply of^ paper and other materials to supply ^sufficit for^ the printing office for more thana year which I took with me and arived in Nauvoo on the 4th Nov.I spent the winter of 1843 & 4 in Nauvoo recieved my Endowments with the Twelveremained in business in the printing office untill the 20th Jan 1844 when I settled my

 (*2nd, Page 6th paper apart)On the 5 day of Oct 1846 while with the Camp of Israelbuilding up Winter Quarter on the west side of the MissouriRiver then Indian Country I passsed passed through one of the mostpainful scenes of my life and serious misfortune of any of my lifeI took my ax and went 2 1/2 miles onto the bluffs to cut some shingletimber to cover my cabin I was acompanied by two other men andwhile falling the third tree ^which was an oak over two feet in diameter^ I steped backed of it some 8 feet and also oneside about the same distance where I thought I was entirely out of dangerbut when the tree fell (being over two feet in diameter) ther being a crookin the body of it, it struck a knowl on the ground and the whole body of the treeshot end ways back of the stump and bounded & the but of the tree struckme in the breast and knocked me several in the air against a standingOak and the falling tree followed me in its bend and caught meagainst the standing tree and I came down between ^the two trees^ them onestanding & the other falling but before reaching the ground I wasliberated from between them and struck the ground upon my feet.It badly bruised my left thigh the whole leangth of it and my hipalso my left arm it also broak my breast bone into also 3 ribson my left side it also bruised my lungs, vitals, and left side ina shocking manor. After the accident I sat upon a log untillMr John Garrison went a quarter of a mile to get my horse. Notwith-standing I was so badly hurt I had to mount my horse and ride2 1/2 miles over a very rough road and had to dismout twice inconsequence of miry places, my breast and vitals was so badly tornto peaces that each step of the horse went through me like an arrowI continued on horsback untill I arived at Turky Creek on theNorth side of Winter Quarters I then became exhausted & was takenoff and carried in a chair to my waggon not having a ^my^ cabin builtI was met in the street by president Brigham Young H. C Kimball, WRichards & others who assisted in carrying me to my family. Before lyingme upon my bed the presidency laid hands upon me rebuked my suffering& distress in the name of the Lord and said I should live andnot die. I was then laid upon my bed in my waggon and asthe Apostles prophesied upon my head so it came to pass I did live andnot die. I employed no physician on this occasion but was administered 
 to by the Elders of Israel and nursed by my wife I lay uponmy bed unabled to move untill my breast bone began to nittogether which commenced on the 9th day I began to walk about in20 days from the time I was hurt and in 30 days from the time I washurt I again commenced hard labour. And It has alwaysappeared miraculous to me that with all the injuries and broken bonesthat I have had, I have not a lame limb about me but havebeen enabled ever since to endure the hardest manual labor,exposure, hardships and injuries have even walked 40, 50 & on one occasion60 miles in a day. However if I over labor or take a severe cold Ifeel it more sensibly in my breast and left side than I didbefore my last injury.  Thus I have occupied considerable space inreferring to those peculiar circumstances which here attending me ^thus far^ during lifeand to sum the matter up it stands about thus. I have broakenboth legs (one twice in two) both arms, both ancles, my breast bone,3 ribs, have been drowned, froze, & scalded. have been in twowater wheels under a full head of water, bitten by a mad dogand passed through a score of other hair breadth escapes. Yet themercies of God have been over me, and my life has thus farbeen preseved upon the Earth for which blessing I feel to renderthe gratitude of my heart with thanksgiving to my HeavenlyFather praying that the remainder of my days, may be spentin his service & the building up of his Kingdom(Page 9th * History) Having embraced the fullness of the Everlasting Gospel ofJesus Christ and seeing in it great beauty, power, glory & salvationI had a great ^great^ desire to teach it to my ^the gospel fellow men, and thisdesire increased upon me and rested with great wait upon mymind but ^which^ I did not reveal this to any man ^person^. But one Sundayevening I retired into the woods alone by myself and called uponthe Lord in earnest prayer to open my way to go and preachthe gospel of Salvation to the children of men ^inhabitants of the Earth^. The Spirit of theLord rested upon me & bore witness unto me that my prayer washeard & should be answered upon my head. I arose from myknees happy & walked some forty rods through a thick wood intoan open road, as I entered the road there stood before meJudge Elias Higby an High Priest with whom I had been 
 closely associated having ^and^ lived in the same house for a numberof months but had never to my recollection said any thing to meabout preaching or ordination. But now as I approached himhe said Brother Wilford the Spirit of the Lord tells me that youshould be ordained & go and preach the gospel ^on a mission^. I said very wellif it is the will of the Lord I am ready.At a meeting of the High Council at Lyman Wights Clay County Missourion the 5th day of Nov 1834 I was ordained to the office of a priest by thedirections of the High Council under the hands of Brother Simeon CarterStephen Winchester & Heman Hyde were ordained priests at the same time.I called upon Bishop Edward Partridge and asked him what mymission should be in what part of the country I should go to preachthe gospel. He replyed that I should ^Bishop Partridge said he would^ like to have some of the Brethren ^me^ go intothe Southern States through Arkansas Tennesee Kentucky &c if I could findany body who had faith enough to go ^with me^ for it would be a hard missionand a hard ^dangerous^ county to travel in at present in consequence of the Missouripersecutions. I told him I was as ready to go South as any where else if hewished it. As Arkansas lay South of Missouri I asked him if Ishould go through Jackson County as it lay direct in our path ^route^ he saidit would be at the risk of ones life & I have not got faith enough toundertake it if you have you can try it, I asked him if I wentthrough Jackson County if I should start without purse or scrip as ingeneral terms that seemed ^according^ to be the law ^of God^. He said that he had not gotfaith enough to start on a mission through Jackson County without moneyand if I dare it I must do it on my own faith. As the commandmentsrequired the Elders to go out without purs or scrip I felt strenous to keepthe commandments so I ^started without money^ resolved that to go without purse or scrip I wished to have some companion go with my ^up^ on my mission I didnot wish to launch forth into the open world alone. I called uponElder Harry Brown (who had accompanied me from Richland New York to Clay CoMissouri) and asked him if he would not accompany me it met hiswishes and Bishop Partridge gave him his mission with me. Andwe immediately ^prepared^ ourselves to start upon our journey And on the 13th day of Jan1835 I recieved the following recommend in connexion with my priests license((Liberty, Clay County, Missouri, Jan 13 1835 This certifies that Wilford Woodruffhas faithfully discharged evry duty required of him in the Camp of the Saintson the 13 day Jan 1835 I received an honorable discharge from Lyman Wight fromthe duties of Zions Camp and 
 in journeying from Kirtland Ohio to this place has been very faithfulin the discharge of his duty since his arival here both temporally and spirituallyis strong in the faith of the Latter Day Saints and worthy of his callingHe is recommended by the Church in this place to any branch where providencemay call him.

May the Lord reward both Mr Jerew & wife &the prysbeterian Minister according to their desires))2nd page 11. ((On the 24th Jan I preached at Mr Nathan Turners in Green County Missouri it being the first time that we had found acongregation during our journey that we could get together and preachto in safety, & the first time that I had ever attempted to, preach thegospel to a congregation in the capacity of a priest or missionary I had good liberty & was followed by Elder Brown ther was a hard snow stormduring the time)) 
 History of Wilford WoodruffIn traceing the history of my Fathers I find it difficult to obtain a satisfactory account of the Woodruff family (from whom I descended) for more than three generation. I learn from the English Book of Heraldry thatWoodruff supposed to be one of my Ancestors was Lord Mayorof the City of London at the time of the great fire in AD 1649 My Great Grand Father Josiah Woodruff lived nearly one hundred years of age and possessed a strong Iron Constitution and performed a great amount of manual labour nearly up to the time of his death. His wifes name was Sarah. He had by her nine children as follows Josiah, Appleton, EldadElisha, Joseph, Roda, Phebe & 2 names not given. One of his daughters marriedmarried a Chase the other a man by the name of NorthMy Grandfather Eldad Woodruff was the third son of Josiah Woodruff. He was born ^in Farmington Hartford County Connecticut^ in 1751. He like his father possessed a strong constitution it was considered ^said^ that he performed the most manual labor for several years of any man in Hartford County Ct. but from over exertion in hewing timber he had asevere ^was^ attack of the ^with^ rheumatism in his right hip which caused asevere lameness in his righ for several years before his deathHe married Dinah Woodford by whom he had 7 children as followsEldad, Elizabeth, Samuel, Aphek, Titus, Hellen, & Ozem. Eldad Married Lewey Woodford, Elizabeth Amasa Frisby. Samuel Miss Case,Aphek Bulah Thompson, & Azubah Hart. Titus Louisa Allan, Hellen AmosWheeler & Ozem Acksa Merrill & Hannah Hart, all of which had anumerous families of children. My Grand Father died ^in Farmington Ct^ with an attack of the^the^ spotted fever in 1806 aged 55 years. My Grand Mother Dinah Woodruffdied in 1824 ^aged the same place^ in Farmington Ct with a cancer in the left breast. Her sufferings were very great.My Father Aphek Woodruff was born in Farmington Hartford County Ct November 11th 1778.  Married Bulah Thompson who was born 1782 Married Nov 29, 1801by whom he had three children, Azmon, born Nov 29 1802. Ozem Thompson born Dec 22nd 1804. Wilford born March 1st 1807. My Mother Bulah Woodruff died with an attack of the spoted fever June 11th 1808 aged 26 years leaving me 15 months old at her death. My Father married for his second wife Azubah Hart Nov born July 31st 18 1792 Married Nov 9th 1810, by whom he had 6 children 
 Philo born Nov 29 th 1811. Died by poison administered by a physician Nov 25 1827 aged 16 years. Asahel Hart born April 11 th 1814. Died ^in Terrahaut In^ October 18th, 1838. Aged 24.  Franklin born March 12 1816 died June 1st 1816 aged 2 months 19 days.  Newton born June 19, 1818 drowned Sept 1820 aged 2 years & 3 months. Julius born April 22nd 1821 died in infancyEunice born June 19th 1820. Married to Dwight I baptized her into the Church of Jesus Christof Latter day Saints July 1st 1838 I married her to Dwight Webster in Farmington CtAug 4th 1841. My Father Aphek Woodruff like his Father was a strong constitu-tioned man, has done a great amout of labour all of his life. He commenced attending a flouring mill & a saw mill at 18 years of age which business he has  nowcontinued in for about 50 years, most of the time he has laboured through the day & one halfof the night. He never made any profession of religion untill I baptized him with all his household into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints on the 1st day of July 1838. Although my Father was not a professor of religion He was a man of great charity, honesty, integrity, & truth. He made himself poor as towealth by giving to the poor & accomodating his fellow man by loaning money and being surety for his neighbor, and always saying yes to evry man who asked a favor at his hand.I was born in the North part of the town of Farmington now called Avon, Hatford ^Hartford^ Co Ct, March 1st 1807. I followed the same occupation of my Fatherthat of a Miller from my youth up until 1831. I assisted my ^Father^ in attending the Farmington Mills untill I was 20 years of age, in the spring of 1827 I tookthe flouring Mill of my Aunt Hellen Wheeler which I attended 3 years. In thespring of 1830 I took charge of the flouring Mill of Mr Collins the Ax manufacturerin South Canton Ct, at the end of one year it was demolished to make way for other Machinery, in the spring of 1831, I took charge of the flouring Mill owned by Mr Richard B. Cowles of New Hartford Connecticut. In the spring of 1832 in company with my oldest brother Azmon Woodruff I went to Richland Oswago County N York & purchased a farm & saw Mill& setled down in business for awhiles.Variant & divers are the lives & fortunes of man in every age of the world. While thepath of some are strewn with flowers & ease from the cradle to the graves withnaught to disturb their peace others apparently are marked victims of variatedmisfortune accidents & dangers. The last named class is the one in whose ranksI have stood through my infancy childhood youth & manhood up to the presenttime so much so that it has seemed as though some invisible power or fate was 
 watching my footsteps in order to find some opportunity to take my life fromthe Earth but I can ownly attribute the continuation of my life on Earthto the present time to a merciful God whose hand has been streched out & rescuedme from death in the midst of the many dangers and hair breadths escapes which I have passed through in life some of which I will here mentionWhen three years of age I fell into a caldron of boiling water was instantly caught out& so badly scalded that is was 9 months before I was considered out of danger. Whenfive years of age I fell from the great beam of a barn upon my face upon the beam floorwhich came near breaking my neck three months afterwards I broke one of myarms falling down a pair of stairs.  I soon broke the other arm falling out of a high stoop across some timber. When six years of age I came near being killedby a surly bull and was ownly saved as it were by a miracle. During the same yearI went into my Fathers saw mill with several other children I got upon the head blockto take a ride while running the carriage back not anticipating any danger but beforeI was aware of it my leg was caught between the head block & fender post & broakboth bones in two below the knee I was taken to the house & lay 9 hours before mybones was set which time was spent amid severe pain: but being young my bonessoon nit together & in few weeks I was again upon my feet attending to the sports ofmy youth. During my confinement with this lameness my brother Thompson was mycompanion in the same room going through with a course of the typus feverWhen 7 years of age I was riding on the top of a load of hay which my UncleOzem Woodruff was driving to the barn when he turned the load over on top of me and before it was I was nearly strangled for the want of air before it was removedfrom me. While 8 years of age I was riding in a one horse waggon with several others to go to our labor the horse took fright ran down a steep hill and turned us over with the waggon on top of us. But again while in the midst of dangermy life was preserved none of us was seriously injured. While 9 years of age I clumb ^climbed^into an Elim tree to obtain some bark. I steped upon a dry tree limb and I fellabout 15 feet upon my back which apparently beat the breath out of my body a cousinran & told my parents I was dead, before they arrived at the spot I came to my sensesarose upon my feet & met my Parents coming to me. At 12 years of age Iwas drowned in Farmington River & sunk in 30 feet of water and was miraculouslysaved by a young man named Bacon, I suffered much in being restored to lifeAt 13 years of age while passing through Farmington meadows in the depth of winter with the roads drifted with snow and in an exceeding blustering day I became 
 Became so chilled & overcome with cold I could not travel, I crawled into thehollow of a large tree to rest me. A man in the distance seeing me go into ithastened to my ^rescue^ realizeing more fully than I did the danger I was in when he arrivedat the spot I had fallen asleep & was nearly insensible, he had much difficulty inarousing me to a sens of my situation. He procured means to convey me to myFathers house and through a kind profidence my life was again preservedAt 14 years of age I split my left instep open with an ax which went nearly through my foot & ^it^ was 9 months getting well. At 15 years of age I was bitten in my left hand by a mad dog in the last stage of the Hydrophobia. He ownly clampedmy hand with his teeth but did not draw blood and I was preserved throughthe mercy of God from an awful death. At the age of 17 I met with an accidentwhich caused me much suffering & came near ending my life. I was riding a veryill tempered horse which I was not acquainted with, and while going down a very steeprocky hill the horse took the advantage of the ground suddenly leaped from the road & randown the steepest part of the hill amid the thicket & the rocks at full speed and he commencedkicking up at the same time & about landing me over his head among the rocks but I lodgedon the top of his head grasped one hand hold of each ear as with a death grasp expecting evrymoment to be dashed to peaces against the rocks while in this position sitting astride his neckwith no bridle to guide him but his ears he plunged down the hill among the rocks with allforce ^speed^ untill he ran against a rock which dashed him to the Earth I went over his head& the rock about one rod & struck the ground square upon my being the ownly thingvisible that saved my life, for had ^I^ struck upon any othe part of my body it must have killed me instantly, as it was my boenes bones crushed from under me as though theywere reeds. It broke my left leg twice in two & put out both of my ancles in a shocking manner, and the horse came nigh rolling over me in his struggles toget up. ^My uncle Titus Woodruff saw^ An uncle of mine saw me fall, hastened to my relief got amist me && carried me to his house in an arm chair, I lay from 2 oclok till 10 at nightwithout ^medical aid^ assistance then my Father arrived bringing Dr T Swift of Farmington with himwho set my bones boxed up my limbs & carried me in his carriage 8 miles that night to my Fathers house my sufferings were very great yet I had good attention& in 8 weeks I was outdoors upon my cruches & soon was all well againIn 1827 while attending the Flouring Mill attempting to clear the ice out of a waterwheel standing upon the wheel with one arm around the shaft a man hoisted the gatelet a full head of water upon it as soon as the water struck it it stopped my feetsliped into [word covered] I immediately plunged head fore most over the rim of the 
 wheel into about 3 feet of water and my weight drew my legsout of the wheel or I should have been drawn under a shaft & crushed to death. In 1831, while having charge of the Flouring Mill in Collinsv-ville Ct I was standing inside of a breast wheel 20 feet in diameterupon one of the arms near the top clearing out the ice when a full head of water was let onto it it immediately started. I dropped my ax and leapedthrough the wheel to the bottom of it by the shaft & arms about 20 feet as I struckthe bottom of the wheel I was rolled out against a ragged stone well with ownly about 2 feet clearance between it & the wheel the wheel caught me & rolled ^me^ outinto the water below where I found myself without any broken bones but withsome bruises & much fright. ^*see paper apart^ In 1833 the day I was baptized into theChurch of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints one of my horses newly calkedkicked my hat of my head & had he struck 2 inches lower would probably have killed me instantly. In 10 minutes afterwards while driving the same horsesdown a hill on a sled without any box the bottom boards sliped forwardunder the roll caught the ground turned endways fell on the horses badlythrowing me between the horses they ran to the bottom of the hill draging meby the lines head foremost with the steed top of me about rods overa smooth snow path I escaped unharmed however in the midst of both dangersIn 1834, while travelling in Zions Camp to Missouri a rifle was accidentallydischarged & the ball passed through three tents with a dozen men in each & lodgedin a waggon axletree with a man standing against it it injured no one. It passed withina few inches of my breast & many others escaped as narrowly as my selfA few months afterwards a musket was accidentally snaped with the muzzle pointing atmy breast within a few feet of me heavily loaded with buck shot but it missed fireand my life was again preserved.  In April 1839 in Rochester Ill I was ridingupon the running gears of a waggon without any box, I was sitting upon the fore wardaxletree and the bolt came out fastening the cupling pole this left the hind wheels & myweight on the forward bolster & tongue turned the coupling pole clear over onto the horsesbacks, turned the stakes upside down & shut me up fast between the boulster & tonguebut in such a manner that my head & shoulders dragged on the ground my horsestook fright and ran out into an open pari prairie & thus draged me in this positionfor about half a mile when I managed so as to guide them with my left hand so as to to run them into a corner of a high worm fence where we landed in a piletogether, I was considerably bruised but landed withou escaped without any broken bones

ButI never made a profession of religion untill 1830, being 23 years of age I did not then join any church ^for the reason that I could not find any^ for the reason body of people or denomination or Church whoshad for their foundation, doctrin, tenets, faith or practice, ^agreed with^ the gospel of Jesus Christ or the ordinances ^&^ gifts & practices which Christ & the Apostles taught  & practiced ^in their day^in there day & generation for the salvation of the children of Man Although the teachers of the day taught that the faith, gifts, graces, miracles, & ordinances which the prophets, Savior & the Apostles enjoyed were done away & no longer needed I did not believe a word of it to be true ownly as they were done away through the unbeliefsof the children of men I believed the same gifts graces miracles & power would be manifest the same in one age of the world as in another when God did have a Church & kingdom upon the Earth, I did not believe that the Church of Christ did exist upon the Earth in an organized form, but I believed there had been a falling awayfrom the Apostolic order of things,  but that the Church & kingdom of God would beesstablished upon the Earth in my day & generation and that I should live to see it. This principle was rivited upon my mind from two causes 1st from the perusal of the Old & New Testament with fervent prayer that the Lord would show me what was right & wrong & lead me in the path of salvation, without any regard to the opinions of man& the whisperings of the spirit of the Lord unto me for the space of three years did teach ^taught^me in accordance with the ^written^ word of God that He was about to set up his Church & Kingdom upon the Earth in the last days ^and that his "righteousness was about to be revealed & his salvation to come forth"^ ^as said the Prophet Isaiah in his 56 chapter^ And secondly I was taught this principle from my youthup to manhood by an aged man by the name of Robert Mason who lived in Simsbury Ct who was frequently called the old prophet Mason, ^who taught^ who did teach me many things which are now coming to pass. He prophesied of many of those events which are now takeplace. He did not believe that any man upon the Earth in the midst of the Christian Nations 
 ^Had authority^ to administer in the ordinances of the House of the Lord but believed that it was ourprivilege through faith, prayer, & fasting to heal the sick, & cast out devils by the laying on of hands which was the case under his administration as numbers could testify.I was living in this state of mind & in this faith & belief looking for the coming forth ofthe Church of Christ when I heard of what was called Mormonism. In 1832 Iwas loudly called upon by the spirit of the Lord to go to the state of Rhode Island one ofmy brother ^Asahel^ was also called to go to the same place & at the same time when we metwe both told our feelings & what the spirit of the Lord had whispered unto us & we marvelled & wondered what the Lord wanted of us in Rhode Island, but as we had made preparations to move to the west we let outward circumstances controll us, and like Jonah instead of going to Ninivah went to Tarshis, so we instead of going to Rhode Island went to Richland Oswego CountyN. York, and there remained until the 29 day of Dec 1833 before I heard a gospel sermonby a latter day saint.  I then soon learned what the Lord wanted of us in Rhode Islandfor at the time we were commanded ^warned^ of the Lord to go there, two of the Elders of the Latter daySaints were preaching there & had we gone we certainly should have embraced thework at that time, but as it was we had to wait for the next callOn the 29th day of Dec 1833, Elder Zera Pulsipher & Elijah Cheeny calledat my house & gave out an appointment for preaching in the school house in thatneighborhood that [illegible] evening I attended as did my brother Azmon WoodruffWe both believed, invited the Elders to our home & offered ourselvesfor baptism the first sermon we heard. We read the Book of Mormon& had a testimony that it was true. And on the 31 day of Dec 1833 I wasbaptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints under the handsof ^by^ Elder Zera Pulsipher & confirmed the same evening under his handsOn the 2nd day of January 1834 I was ordained to the office of a teacher& my eldest brother Azmon Woodruff an Elder & a small branch organizedof 12 members all under the hands of ^by^ Elder Pulsipher. In the month of FebruaryI walked in company with Elder Holton some 60 miles to the town of Fabeus to attend an evening meeting of the Saints in that place where Elder Pulsipher was presiding. here ^I^ saw for the first time the Book of Commandments or revelations given through Joseph Smith and I believed them with all my heart & rejoiced therein & after spending two days with them we returned home rejoicing several days with them &holding several meetings we returned home rejoicing. During the winter we were visited by several of the Elders among whom ^was^ Elder Harry Brown in February. He again called upon us about the first of February ^1834^ accompanied by Elder Parley P. Pratt it being the first
