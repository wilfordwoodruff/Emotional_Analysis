Woodruff Also T D  Brow &amp; John Cook of the missionaries. The Quarter Conference was opened by Prayer by O. Pratt. After Singing P. P. Pratt Addressed the People for 2 1/2 hours Evry missionary present had a cold sore throat &amp; was  hoarse it had came on during the last 24 hours it was a complaint that was quite universal among men women &amp; children many hundreds were Attacked in the same way there was no change in the weather nor any thing in the outward appearance of the Elements to cause it. Elder Pratt was quite unwell He said He did not intend to Preach this fornoon but He had got to Preach or go to bed. He spoke in a vary interesting manner for 2 1/2 hours upon the subject of the birth Life Death &amp; resurrection of Jesus Christ. He took for his text the 10 &amp; 11  verses of the 2nd chapter of St Luke "And the Angel said unto them fear not for behold I bring you good tidings of great Joy which shall be unto all people for unto you is born this day in the City of David   ENDENTRY  Bethlehem of Judea.   whole school if they would tell her whare Jesus was born born &amp; not one of them could tell her it is true they were  mostly small schollars but there was one almost a man grown &amp; he could not tell. I think there is a neglect among  this people in not teaching their children as they should do the Old &amp; New testament the History of the Prophets &amp; Jesus &amp; the Apostles And I think it time to teach the people the simple things of the word of God And this message of Good News is as necessary to this assembly as it was to the people of Judea we and our children should read the Bible more than we do  learn whare Jesus Christ was born &amp; understand his History I wish to come down to the capacity of children &amp; if they can understand me their Parents can. Perhaps  almost evry child in these vallies at 8 years old know it is necessary to be baptized at that age because they have been taught it by their parents or others but many of them do not know what they are baptized for. But was it not for the name of Jesus Christ all our ordinances  &amp; administrations would be in vain &amp; of no Effect, for if we did not Baptize in the name of Jesus Christ our sins  would not be remitted &amp; if we did not lay on hands in his name for the Holy Ghost or the Healing of the sick the candidate would not receive the Holy Ghost nor the sick be Healed for their is no other name given under Heaven whareby men can be saved we have no promise of obtaining any blessing from God except through &amp; in his name. then it is  vary important that we  his life &amp; History. some do not know whether He was born in Asia or America. Jesus Christ told his deciples that He  had other sheep which were not of this fold (those in Jerrusalem) He came to this continant desended from Heaven &amp; stood in the midst of a congregation of saints that were assembled to worship God but He was not born here but He preached  the Gospel here after his death, and holding a three days meeting in Hell &amp; preaching the gospel to the spirits in prison  while his body lay in the tomb then rising from the tomb  &amp; asscending into heaven then He descended to this contin- ant in his immortal body &amp; not ownly preached the Gospel  here among the Nephites but chose twelve Apostles Here &amp; taught many plain simple, Great &amp; glorious things the whole History of which you can read in the Book of mormon He told the people He was Jesus Christ who was born in  Jerrusalem &amp; there crusified for the sins of the world. He told them He had other sheep yet which were not of this Fold neither  at Jerrusalem but were the lost sheep of the House of Israel He must also go &amp; visit them &amp; when we get the record of of the Ten lost tribes of Israel we shall get an account of his visit among them I want to Preach Jesus Christ to you this day   ENDENTRY  of Christ you ar Celestial Glory or to become sons of Perdition. For those who have not received a fulness of the Gospel &amp; the Holy Ghost will not always  remain in hell but be redeemed in the own due time of the Lord  &amp; receive some kind of a glory like the stars in comparison to the  son but whare God &amp; Christ &amp; celestial saints dwell they cannot  come worlds without End but those who have partaken of the fulness of the Gospel &amp; the Holy Ghost &amp; they deny the Lord &amp; shed innocent Blood or give there consent thereto they commit the unpardonable sin &amp; there is no forgiveness in  this world nor in the world to come, and I wish you all to  understand that if you are Baptized &amp; receive the Holy Ghost &amp; your Endowments &amp; are sealed up unto Eternal life against  all manner of sins &amp; blasphemies except  the Holy Ghost that mercy cannot rob Justice that after all  this  it &amp; pay for it in this life &amp; if the sin is great Enough you will  have to be destroyed in the Flesh &amp; if necessary be deliverd over  to the buffitings of satan untill the day of redemption &amp; if your sins are not unto death you may then come forth &amp; be exhal- ted to glory Immortality &amp; Eternal life but it is a great deal better not to sin at all. I want all the children that are 8 years old &amp; all young persons &amp; all old people &amp; strangers that have not been baptized to come foreward &amp; be baptized &amp; also those who have commit sins for which they should  be baptized for that they may begin to be candidats  either for the fulness of Celestial Glory or sons of  perdition. Many other interesting remarks were made by the speaker but no one reporting they were not taken    He took for his text "examine yourselves whether ye be in the  faith or no and said many may think they possess things  which they do not possess &amp; this may be the case with  regard to their faith. do we feel as we once did I think not at least I can say that many are not as faithful as they once were I look upon the saints as subject to a complete warfare the question was asked anciently shall there be faith on the Earth when the Lord comes. I know of No people on Earth that have to make greater exertions to keep from being worldly minded than this people  for we have been broaken up so many times &amp; driven  from place to place that we have had to labour night &amp; day in order to live or to obtain the necessaries of life but in the midst of our labour do we remember our prayers, do we pray three times a day but says one I have to go to the canyons to get wood &amp; I have not time  to stop to pray. But I can say I never knew a great man in the Kingdom of God but what was a praying man Daniel was a great Prophet &amp; business man yet He alway found time to pray 3 times a day &amp; he even kept up this practice when He became prime minister of Babylon &amp; presided over all the princes &amp; business of that great kingdom what a glorious example for this people for let us have ever so much to do we should never neglect our prayers   ENDENTRY  I think that man is in the road to ruin. there is sufficient before our eyes to cause us to pray. I do not think there  ever was a greater miracle than this people coming here &amp; doing what they have done How has this been accomplished by the faith of the faithful of this people &amp; the blessings of the Lord upon us. I have often wondered why so few out of the thousands who hear the testimony of the servants of God have  received it &amp; again why so few remain faithful to the end  who do receive it. it is because they have lost their faith if  they ever had any. we should not ownly have faith but works &amp; treasure up evry useful knowledge within our reach  for I do not believe that the spirit of God will go out of his  course to teach men those things which they are to lazy to learn when they have the means within their reach. I  know that this people can learn more in 3 months than other people can in 12. He spoke of schools and the duty of parents to children  their paintings &amp; sculpture which were preserved as the choice monuments of art &amp; greatness but mothers &amp; teachers  will make an impression upon the mind of youth which  will last long after the painting is worn to threads &amp; the marble crumbles to dust.    the school House &amp; were addressed by Elder T. D Brown addressed the people. He said I am appointed a missionar but in another part of the vineyard I felt a desire to come to this place it does not seem but a short time since I began travelling &amp; preaching. I have thought of the words of Brother Clements Do we believe in God I have thought much upon this subject I have spent most of my time for the last two years among the  Indians I have seen much of the dealings of the Lord  among that people &amp; we have been blessed in admin- istering unto them. I have red of late the History of  in that work is Good &amp; is calculated to do much good the instance of his lameness &amp; under the necessity of having a bone taken from his leg &amp; the doctor wanted to bind him He said no bind me not I can endure what is necessary to be done I do not  wish my mother present as it will cause her pain  to see me suffer &amp; I wish to save her all the sorrow I can this act showed his strong character in the days  of his youth &amp; his Effection for his mother. God has bestowed great blessings upon this People and I would Here ask how many there are in this congregation  that are 8 years old who have not been baptized &amp; there are some parents who do not teach their  children the necessity of it every family should have in their Library the bible Book of Mormon Doctrin &amp; Covenants &amp; the Life of Joseph, &amp; we should learn to practice the preceps of our savior we should love our Brethren feed the poor cloth the naked   ENDENTRY August 29, 1854       ENDENTRY August 30, 1854    for posts spent the night in the canyon 25    ENDENTRY August 31, 1854    FIGURES I received 3 letters &amp; wrote 2 to Bernhisel    ENDENTRY September 1, 1854    a load of post &amp; spent the night at at Brother Lovreigm 25    ENDENTRY September 2, 1854       ENDENTRY September 3, 1854    his mission to the states    ENDENTRY September 4, 1854    Mr Perry for $1300 for 6 months &amp; a half till the 1 for the Government officer who had command of the troops    ENDENTRY September 5, 1854 ~ Tuesday to  ENDENTRY September 9, 1854    &amp; choring &amp; preparing the House for company    ENDENTRY September 10, 1854    Elder O Pratt in the afternoon upon the law of consecration &amp; followed by O Hyde    ENDENTRY September 11, 1854 ~ Monday to  ENDENTRY September 16, 1854    Creek Canyon I hiered Robert  Wheeler for $1 per day &amp; board.

This blessing was sealed upon him  as it belonged to him by right throug the linage of his  Fathers it was recorded in the Historians office taken  from the report of Thomas Bullock.     most of my family &amp; went to the 14 ward school house  the house was filled to overflowing I went into the stand  with the Bishop I felt as though I was full of fire I  was full of that Electric flown through President Young during the day there  was no reporter to record my words, but the following  is a synopsis of my remarks as far as I can recollect    with you &amp; to speak of the things of the Kingdom of God &amp;  to hear from my brethren. I have been full of thought &amp; reflection this day while sitting &amp; hearing from President  Young, &amp; I feel to thank God with all my heart that He has  bestowed upon us such a leader in this dispensation yes president  Young is a leader in Israel &amp; one that is not ashamed to  rebuke sin in high places He will guard well the interest  &amp; salvation of this People reguardless of all consequences  &amp; I feel it my duty as an Apostles of Jesus Christ &amp; an Elder  in Israel to sustain him in his office &amp; back up ^his testimony^ by my faith  &amp; works &amp; I also consider it the duty of evry Apostle  Bishop, Elder, &amp; officer &amp; member in the Church of Jesus  Christ to do the same if we are not willing to do it we are  not worthy of the place we occupy. &amp; when we know that  sin wickedness &amp; improper conduct exhist in any of our  wards we should rebuke that evil &amp; correct it in our own houses &amp; wards &amp; not leave it all for President Young to do. we  have Evils in our own ward we have wicked men who will  blaspheme the name of God &amp; who are striving to destroy our  wives &amp; daughters. I have seen some of those same men  come here to meeting &amp; set &amp; laugh me in the face all the  while I was speaking &amp; they will set &amp; laugh the  Bishop in the face while he is speaking this class of  young men some of them are members of the church yet  they will join with the wicked &amp; come here to meeting &amp;  take a seat in the back part of the house &amp; get together in  a group &amp; gather all the young women &amp; girls around them  they can &amp; then conduct in a rediculous manner instead of  paying attention to the preaching. that class of men should  stay at home for while they conduct as they do I would  rather have their room than their company. they are also  useing evry exhertion to draw away our young women &amp; girls to  parties &amp; would destroy them if they could. shall we sleep  unconcerned as Elders &amp; parents while these scenes are enacted  around us no I will not do it &amp; I feel to exhort this con- gregation to wake up &amp; know what is going on around them  &amp; their families &amp; not suffer your wives &amp; daughters to  mingle with Military officers soldiers, Horslers &amp; cooks &amp; gentils  in balls parties rides &amp; other amusements untill they are defiled   ENDENTRY  fire than to cure them after they are burned. I would  far prefer to bury any wife or child I have than to  have them live to dishonor my name &amp; disgrace themselves  by commiting sin with the gentiles. If the Bishop sees  any member of my family children or wives come here to meeting &amp; take a seat in the back part of the House &amp;  spend the time in play instead of attending to the preaching  I wish him to call them by name &amp; let them be reproved  openly if they will take that course for they all know that  that to be against my council &amp; I wish the Bishop would  pursue that course with all persons who come here &amp; do not  do right. we should not be ashamed or afraid to rebuke  wickedness sin &amp; abominations whence ever we know of  existance in our midst. for by doing right we will ever be supported  by the right hand of the Lord. there is not the least trembling  in my bo resisting &amp; rebuking sin for I would rather die wifeless &amp;  childless &amp; see my dwellings laid in ruins &amp; my own body fall  in the gap than to permit whordoms, wickedness &amp; abominations  to exhist in our families wards &amp; cities unrebuked &amp; unchecked  for we as a people have to sanctify ourselves before the Lord in order to  Lord upon us. It will be far better for us to restrain our  children from Evil than to suffer them to go headlong to ruin  &amp; they will thank God to all Eternity that there parents have  given them good council &amp; restrained them from Evil rather  than to be permitted to plunge into misery sin sorrow &amp; woe  we should treat our wives &amp; children with kindness &amp;  affection &amp; give them good council &amp; when we have done all we  can for them then if they will do ^w^rong &amp; go to ruin our gar- ments are clear &amp; I hope from this time forth that we  may not look upon sin with any degree of allowance of  approbation which may God grant for Christ Amen    Richards Samuel Richards all backed up my  testimony. the spirit of the Lord rested upon us &amp; we had  a good time    ENDENTRY February 19, 1855    evening in the Grammar school.
