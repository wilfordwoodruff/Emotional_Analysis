 shall all be fulfilled. aAnd though Heaven & Earth pass away, my words shall not pass away but shall be fulfilled saith the Lord. These revelations and testimonies you have before you. Let my Saints search the Word of the Lord and treasureup wisdom, and be prepared for that which is to come. As I have Decreed,so shall my Judgments Begin at the House of God. There are those in my Church, who have a name among you, who are Adulterers, & Adulteresses, &those who Blaspheme my Name, and those who love & make a lie and those who revel and Drink with the Drunken, if they do not speedily repent of this wickedness & Abomination they should be severed from the ordinances of my House saith the Lord. And There are many who have need to repentwhose lusts are set upon the things of this world, and ^who^ aspire to the honors ofmen, and do not honor the priesthood aid ^nor^ seek to build up the kingdomof God, as they should. Neither do they learn and comprehend that the rights of the priesthood are inseparably connected with the powers of Heaven, andthat the powers of Heaven cannot be controlled nor handled only upon the principles of Righteousness. Such should repent and turn unto theLord & seek for the Holy Spirit to guide them; Blened are the Judgmentswill begin upon my House, and from thence will they go forth unto the worldand the wicked cannot escape. Blessed are the pure in Heart, for my Blessingsawait them in this Life, and Eternal Life in the world to come.

 I have had some questions asked onein regards to some points on which I didnot feel to answer, it is well known thatamong the world thy prevent ad distroy theirchildren, and works of this nature are in the handsof the people, and those practices are quite common.And on account of these questions being asked me I am lead to ask the following questions.First, will repentance and baptism wash away sins ofpersons that have practised hindering conception and dis-troying the seed before life has entered the child.Second,will repentance and baptism wash away sins of thosewho have distroyed their children before birth or after.Third,Those persons who joined the church and have been awayin the world for 20 or 30 years and have practisedthese things how would their case be.If the above were baptiese, any or either of them, would they be entitled to laying on of hands, and to receive thepriesthood.

 done during the severe winter season in the northerncountry where it is nearly impossible for Elders to get about,as reported by those who are there. But early in the spring coming, present prospect would seem to justify the call for at least a dozen or 20 Elders to engage in missionary work to advantage.One very interesting feature of the work I wouldnot fail to mention, which is the personal and very agreeableacquaintance I have been able to form with Mr Hammond, Editorof the "Brooklyn Eagle," and through this acquaintance a recognitionin the paper of the Latter-day Saints as a christian community; and a presentation in the paper, side by side with other religious denom-inations, of our doctrines and principles as reports of sermons &c.Also to have the time and place of our Sunday meetings appear in the Saturday paper free of charge. The Editor has also expressed a desire through interviews with me to become acquainted with the history of the Mormon people, and of my experience with them &c.The fact that such a paper as the Eagle will recognize and publishour doctines as freely from a "Mormon" Elder, as other doctrines fromthe most noted Rev. of other churches is itself throwing down thegantlet as it were to all other people, and saying, "they are as goodas you," is a mighty sermon of itself; while it will carry our doctrinesand testimony to scores of thousands of people, and in manyplaces where personal testimony might never reach.

 Very good letter. The money—$5575—I supp-ose should be returned to him as soon aspossible. J. F. S.50 Concord St, Brooklyn, N. Y.Augt 19, 1896.President, W. Woodruff,and Council:Dear Bretheren:Permit me to acknowledge receipt of your favor of the 12th inst, with accompanying Blanksfor reports of returning missionaries &c: and to assure you it shall be my pleasure to do all in my powerto assist you in the realization of all that is desired,as expressed therein.This mission has been somewhat unfortunate in havingso many of the missionaries return home before their laborshad become really profitable to the mission, or to themselves.Nearly all of them have been Elders without experience inthe missionary field, and quite a number with very littleknowledge of the Bible, the Gospel, or history of the Church.Very much of this necessary information has to be acquired by carefulstudy after reaching their fields of labor.Not having experienced Elders to labor with and assist thisclass, it is very difficult with them to over come the embarrass-ment which delays their appearing in public, other than bydistributing tracts and having an occasional conversation with individuals.

 some five or six articles have appeared of from half to two-thirdsof a columne in length, while reports of sermons from other churcheshave had only a few inches of space in the same paper.I have called upon the Editor of the "World" twiceand have succeeded in getting 3 or 4 short articles in that paper,but find the Editor very careful about admitting any thing thatwould be likely to encourage discussion or controversy of a re-ligious nature; and he has extended very little encouragementas yet. I intend however to occasionally test his generosity, as bygiving name and address I have already had important personalcorrespondence making further inquiry, even from professional gentlemen.As to this department of my missionary labors, I have alreadyabout as much on my hands as I can well attend to, and findit inconvenient to be away from my office any length of time, with-out an accumulation of inquisative correspondence, both fromElder's and others, who are strangers, extending even to other countries.There are 6 members and some children leaving here forUtah tomorrow, and quite a number more are making ready to leave in the spring. They have friends already there, and are veryanxious to reach them as soon as possible. Can Bro. Spence do anything to assist then by way of reduced fares? I have no occasionto preach or encourage emigration, so long as the mission mustdepend upon its members for financial support, as its resourcesare diminishing greatly by absence of those able to go. 
 50 Concord St Brooklyn, N. Y.January 1st 1897.Prest Wilford Woodruff; & Council:Salt Lake City:Dear Bretheren; Permit meto greet you again with a "Happy New Year," which I am pleased to say we are enjoying here, and I am pleased to hand you herewith Report of our doings in the Eastern States Mission during the past year; both of Church and Financial affairs.The Elders in this Mission are generally well in health,and are enjoying their labors in the Ministry. Many friendsare being made: places are being a pencil for holding meetingsin doors more abundantly than heretofore, and numbersof persons are expressing themselves quite satisfied with theGospel requirements. It is reported to me that quite a number of persons would commence a new life with this"New Year" day by being Baptized.During the past year much time has been employed visiting among the people, distributing tracts, and thereby much prej-udice has been removed, and the first thereof is now ripening.

 The Elders of this Mission, now numbering 27 in all,are mostly engaged in the States of New York and in Pennsylvania, with only two in Rhode Island, and onein Maine. The northern parts of the Mission in winter are so severe as to almost entirely prevent travel among the people, and it has been thought advisable to locate nearpopulous parts of the mission, where winter would leastinterfere with the Elders in getting among the people.At a late Conference of the Elders held at Scranton, theywere found to be so distributed as to anticipate succesfullabors for the wintery season, quite as well as the summer.The removal of Mission HeadQuarters last July from 48 Lands Stto 50 Concord St was a change of considerable advantage to theMission, as well as much more desirable for an Office, and place of meeting; also, for more comfortable as a residence,with room to accomodate calling Elders with Lodgings, savingto them Expensive Hotel Bills, &cA few competent Elders of Experience in Missionary work wouldgreatly aid and encourage the many inexperienced who arealready here. The accompanying Sheets will furnish youstatistical information of additions, removals, and ofthe Missions finances, &c.

 As to the inclosed financial account, the expensesof the Mission will be considerably less the coming yearthan it has been the past: less all the furnishings necessary to enable those here to live at home, and by which Elders passingback & forth can spend a day or two when desirable withoutbeing at the expense of Hotel fare for food and Lodgings.The item of Postage &c in the accounts has been muchof it made by purchaseing postage Stamps with which to makeremittances for the purchase of Books, Tracts, and Cards, whichwill be less till those are disposed of now on hand.In refference to any matter in this communication, or other,I shall be pleased to have any suggestions or instructions whichit may be your pleasure to give for the Mission's welfare, and the entire conformity to your wishes.Myself, Sister R. and Elder Barnes are all in comfortable health, and have joy in our labors among the people. Sister R. is a great advantage to the mission in many ways: not only in making a com-fortable home for those who must be at the office, but especially amongthe sick she is very useful, and by her attention she has securedwarm friends to whom she has been a blessing and comforter.They join with me in best wishes for your welfare, and praying that God may be ever with you.

 50 Concord St., Brooklyn, N. Y.June 16, 1897.Pres't. Wilford Woodruff,Box B, Salt Lake City, Utah.Dear Brother: Enclosed please find financial report of the EasternStates Mission, which is the first three month of my jurisdiction here. I understand that you are desirous of having me report quarterly, our financial condition, and annually the Statistical,which I will continue to do.As you are aware, our mission is yet in its infancey. I have been kept quite bussy engaged since my arriva^l^ here, visitingthe various fields where the Elders are, and organizing them into Conferences, and Branches, and I am pleased to report that thingshere are assuming a prosperous condition. Our Elders are mostly all traveling without money, and they report to me hospitable treatment in nearly all instances. A few are being baptized in all parts of the mission. In Philadelphia we have Nine Elders who are working very zealoulsly, in tracting the City, and holdingmeetings; they rent a house and board themselves. I have fourElders here with me who are w[or]king in Brooklyn and New York: wehold meetings here at 50 Concord St., Sunday aftenrnoon's and a Bible class every Thursday evening.Ever praying for the mutual welfare of "zion" and with love for you and your co-workers, I remain,Your brother, A. P. Kesler

 Brooklyn N. Y.Jan. 4, 1897.By waiting to this date I had hoped I had hopedto receive full reports of Elders up to close of the year,but I will wait no longer, lest financial matters be wanted.There are no wealthy members of the Church in this mission, and when those who work by the day pay theirtithing, it seems all they can well do. Only two persons payregular monthly donations for the mission, and their namesdo not appear on the tithing list. Other small donationsare made by parties as convenient to them.Of Church matters, such as No. Baptized & received, children blessed, number Emigrated &c. with Report of Elderslabors, I will forword soon, when delayed reports are received.I feel truly thankful to Our Heavenly Father for Hisblessing attending the Mission work and for the pleasingprospects of the future which are growing brighter daily.At a "Mission Hall" in this City, I am invited to preachwhen ever I can put in an appearence. Meetings are held nightly.I have been several time in attendance, and spoken with the Minister's apparent appreciation—always saying—"Come again."Praying heaven's blessings ever to attend you my dearbretheren, and the cause to which your watchcare is given.I remain Your's in Covenant Bonds, S.
