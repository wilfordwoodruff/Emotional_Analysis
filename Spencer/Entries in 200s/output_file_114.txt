The Indians are beginning to again be Hostile they have shot at the Elk mountain mission 3 of the brethren viz Edward Edwards and broke up the mission also are makeing disturbance at Green river mission    ENDENTRY October 19, 1855 ~ Friday   19th In company with Elder T. Kington I rode to  Farmington Davis County to attend a quarterly conference  to commence on the 20th inst. I spent the night at Brother Steeds. Distance of the day 16 mils   After retireing to bed I prayed to the Lord to show me what we should teach the People and I received for answer Let my  servants obtain the Holy Ghost and keep my spirit with them and that will instruct them what to teach the people continually  and instruct the people to keep my spirit with them and they  will be enabled to understand the word of the Lord when it is  taught them    ENDENTRY October 20, 1855 ~ Saturday   Oct 20 Saturday morning at 10 oclock the people assembled and there were present of the Twelve O Pratt and  W. Woodruff Also T D  Brow and John Cook of the missionaries. The Quarter Conference was opened by Prayer by O. Pratt. After Singing P. P. Pratt Addressed the People for 2 1/2 hours Evry missionary present had a cold sore throat and was  hoarse it had came on during the last 24 hours it was a complaint that was quite universal among men women and children many hundreds were Attacked in the same way there was no change in the weather nor any thing in the outward appearance of the Elements to cause it. Elder Pratt was quite unwell He said He did not intend to Preach this fornoon but He had got to Preach or go to bed. He spoke in a vary interesting manner for 2 1/2 hours upon the subject of the birth Life Death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. He took for his text the 10 and 11  verses of the 2nd chapter of St Luke "And the Angel said unto them fear not for behold I bring you good tidings of great Joy which shall be unto all people for unto you is born this day in the City of David   ENDENTRY A Saviour which is Christ the Lord" This is the Saviour born in  Bethlehem of Judea. He said one cause of his ^why I^ taking this text was ^is^ that a school teacher in Great Salt Lake City asked her whole school if they would tell her whare Jesus was born born and not one of them could tell her it is true they were  mostly small schollars but there was one almost a man grown and he could not tell. I think there is a neglect among  this people in not teaching their children as they should do the Old and New testament the History of the Prophets and Jesus and the Apostles And I think it time to teach the people the simple things of the word of God And this message of Good News is as necessary to this assembly as it was to the people of Judea we and our children should read the Bible more than we do at least Our children should read it untill they should  learn whare Jesus Christ was born and understand his History I wish to come down to the capacity of children and if they can understand me their Parents can. Perhaps  almost evry child in these vallies at 8 years old know it is necessary to be baptized at that age because they have been taught it by their parents or others but many of them do not know what they are baptized for. But was it not for the name of Jesus Christ all our ordinances  and administrations would be in vain and of no Effect, for if we did not Baptize in the name of Jesus Christ our sins  would not be remitted and if we did not lay on hands in his name for the Holy Ghost or the Healing of the sick the candidate would not receive the Holy Ghost nor the sick be Healed for their is no other name given under Heaven whareby men can be saved we have no promise of obtaining any blessing from God except through and in his name. then it is  vary important that we shand our children should understand  his life and History. some do not know whether He was born in Asia or America. Jesus Christ told his deciples that He  had other sheep which were not of this fold (those in Jerrusalem) He came to this continant desended from Heaven and stood in the midst of a congregation of saints that were assembled to worship God but He was not born here but He preached  the Gospel here after his death, and holding a three days meeting in Hell and preaching the gospel to the spirits in prison  while his body lay in the tomb then rising from the tomb  and asscending into heaven then He descended to this contin- ant in his immortal body and not ownly preached the Gospel  here among the Nephites but chose twelve Apostles Here and taught many plain simple, Great and glorious things the whole History of which you can read in the Book of mormon He told the people He was Jesus Christ who was born in  Jerrusalem and there crusified for the sins of the world. He told them He had other sheep yet which were not of this Fold neither  at Jerrusalem but were the lost sheep of the House of Israel He must also go and visit them and when we get the record of of the Ten lost tribes of Israel we shall get an account of his visit among them I want to Preach Jesus Christ to you this day   ENDENTRY Plainness and simplicity for untill you receive the fulness of the gospel of Christ you arne not a proper candidate either for a fulness of Celestial Glory or to become sons of Perdition. For those who have not received a fulness of the Gospel and the Holy Ghost will not always  remain in hell but be redeemed in the own due time of the Lord  and receive some kind of a glory like the stars in comparison to the  son but whare God and Christ and celestial saints dwell they cannot  come worlds without End but those who have partaken of the fulness of the Gospel and the Holy Ghost and they deny the Lord and shed innocent Blood or give there consent thereto they commit the unpardonable sin and there is no forgiveness in  this world nor in the world to come, and I wish you all to  understand that if you are Baptized and receive the Holy Ghost and your Endowments and are sealed up unto Eternal life against  all manner of sins and blasphemies except the against the sin of the Holy Ghost that mercy cannot rob Justice that after all  this th if you commit any sin you will have to answer for it and pay for it in this life and if the sin is great Enough you will  have to be destroyed in the Flesh and if necessary be deliverd over  to the buffitings of satan untill the day of redemption and if your sins are not unto death you may then come forth and be exhal- ted to glory Immortality and Eternal life but it is a great deal better not to sin at all. I want all the children that are 8 years old and all young persons and all old people and strangers that have not been baptized to come foreward and be baptized and also those who have commit sins for which they should  be baptized for that they may begin to be candidats  either for the fulness of Celestial Glory or sons of  perdition. Many other interesting remarks were made by the speaker but no one reporting they were not taken   At 3 oclock PM. Elder Gilbert Clements addressed the assembly  He took for his text "examine yourselves whether ye be in the  faith or no and said many may think they possess things  which they do not possess and this may be the case with  regard to their faith. do we feel as we once did I think not at least I can say that many are not as faithful as they once were I look upon the saints as subject to a complete warfare the question was asked anciently shall there be faith on the Earth when the Lord comes. I know of No people on Earth that have to make greater exertions to keep from being worldly minded than this people  for we have been broaken up so many times and driven  from place to place that we have had to labour night and day in order to live or to obtain the necessaries of life but in the midst of our labour do we remember our prayers, do we pray three times a day but says one I have to go to the canyons to get wood and I have not time  to stop to pray. But I can say I never knew a great man in the Kingdom of God but what was a praying man Daniel was a great Prophet and business man yet He alway found time to pray 3 times a day and he even kept up this practice when He became prime minister of Babylon and presided over all the princes and business of that great kingdom what a glorious example for this people for let us have ever so much to do we should never neglect our prayers   ENDENTRY when I see a saint eat and lie down and sleep without praying  I think that man is in the road to ruin. there is sufficient before our eyes to cause us to pray. I do not think there  ever was a greater miracle than this people coming here and doing what they have done How has this been accomplished by the faith of the faithful of this people and the blessings of the Lord upon us. I have often wondered why so few out of the thousands who hear the testimony of the servants of God have  received it and again why so few remain faithful to the end  who do receive it. it is because they have lost their faith if  they ever had any. we should not ownly have faith but works and treasure up evry useful knowledge within our reach  for I do not believe that the spirit of God will go out of his  course to teach men those things which they are to lazy to learn when they have the means within their reach. I  know that this people can learn more in 3 months than other people can in 12. He spoke of schools and the duty of parents to children He said that the painter and artest presented their paintings and sculpture which were preserved as the choice monuments of art and greatness but mothers and teachers  will make an impression upon the mind of youth which  will last long after the painting is worn to threads and the marble crumbles to dust.   At 7 oclock in the evening the People again assembled at  the school House and were addressed by Elder T. D Brown addressed the people. He said I am appointed a missionar but in another part of the vineyard I felt a desire to come to this place it does not seem but a short time since I began travelling and preaching. I have thought of the words of Brother Clements Do we believe in God I have thought much upon this subject I have spent most of my time for the last two years among the  Indians I have seen much of the dealings of the Lord  among that people and we have been blessed in admin- istering unto them. I have red of late the History of O Pratt the simple testimony in that work is Good and is calculated to do much good the instance of his lameness and under the necessity of having a bone taken from his leg and the doctor wanted to bind him He said no bind me not I can endure what is necessary to be done I do not  wish my mother present as it will cause her pain  to see me suffer and I wish to save her all the sorrow I can this act showed his strong character in the days  of his youth and his Effection for his mother. God has bestowed great blessings upon this People and I would Here ask how many there are in this congregation  that are 8 years old who have not been baptized and there are some parents who do not teach their  children the necessity of it every family should have in their Library the bible Book of Mormon Doctrin and Covenants and the Life of Joseph, and we should learn to practice the preceps of our savior we should love our Brethren feed the poor cloth the naked   ENDENTRY August 29, 1854 ~ Tuesday   29 Aug I left the canyon and returned to the city 25 m    ENDENTRY August 30, 1854 ~ Wednesday   30 I went into Harkers Canyon and got a load of pine  for posts spent the night in the canyon 25    ENDENTRY August 31, 1854 ~ Thursday   31 I returned home to the city 25 FIGURES I received 3 letters and wrote 2 to Bernhisel    ENDENTRY September 1, 1854 ~ Friday   Sept 1st I went into dry creek canyon and got a load of post and spent the night at at Brother Lovreigm 25    ENDENTRY September 2, 1854 ~ Saturday   2nd I returned home to the city 25    ENDENTRY September 3, 1854 ~ Sunday   3rd Sunday Orson Pratt spoke to the people upon his mission to the states    ENDENTRY September 4, 1854 ~ Monday   4th Sept I rented my dwelling House to day to  Mr Perry for $1300 for 6 months and a half till the 1st May for the Government officer who had command of the troops    ENDENTRY September 5, 1854 ~ Tuesday to  ENDENTRY September 9, 1854 ~ Saturday   5 to 9 I spent this week moving out of my house  and choring and preparing the House for company    ENDENTRY September 10, 1854 ~ Sunday   10th Sunday G A Smith preached and was followed by Elder O Pratt in the afternoon upon the law of consecration and followed by O Hyde    ENDENTRY September 11, 1854 ~ Monday to  ENDENTRY September 16, 1854 ~ Saturday   11th to 16 I spent this week drawing wood out of City Creek Canyon I hiered Thomas Wheeler for $1 per day and board.

He told Brother Pratt to lay aside his Philosofical reasoning and get revelation from God to Govern him and Enlighten his mind more and it would be a great  Blessing to him to lay aside his books and go into the canyons as  some of the rest of us was doing and it would be better for him He said his Phylosophy injured him in a measure many good  things wer said by President Young that we should grow up  in Revelation so that principle would govern evry act of our lives.

At the close of this meeting I returned home and took  most of my family and went to the 14 ward school house  the house was filled to overflowing I went into the stand  with the Bishop I felt as though I was full of fire I  was full of that Electrickt fluid or spirit of God that had  flown through President Young during the day there  was no reporter to record my words, but the following  is a synopsis of my remarks as far as I can recollect   I arose and said I wam thankful for the privilege of meeting  with you and to speak of the things of the Kingdom of God and  to hear from my brethren. I have been full of thought and reflection this day while sitting and hearing from President  Young, and I feel to thank God with all my heart that He has  bestowed upon us such a leader in this dispensation yes president  Young is a leader in Israel and one that is not ashamed to  rebuke sin in high places He will guard well the interest  and salvation of this People reguardless of all consequences  and I feel it my duty as an Apostles of Jesus Christ and an Elder  in Israel to sustain him in his office and back up ^his testimony^ by my faith  and works and I also consider it the duty of evry Apostle  Bishop, Elder, and officer and member in the Church of Jesus  Christ to do the same if we are not willing to do it we are  not worthy of the place we occupy. and when we know that  sin wickedness and improper conduct exhist in any of our  wards we should rebuke that evil and correct it in our own houses and wards and not leave it all for President Young to do. we  have Evils in our own ward we have wicked men who will  blaspheme the name of God and who are striving to destroy our  wives and daughters. I have seen some of those same men  come here to meeting and set and laugh me in the face all the  while I was speaking and they will set and laugh the  Bishop in the face while he is speaking this class of  young men some of them are members of the church yet  they will join with the wicked and come here to meeting and  take a seat in the back part of the house and get together in  a group and gather all the young women and girls around them  they can and then conduct in a rediculous manner instead of  paying attention to the preaching. that class of men should  stay at home for while they conduct as they do I would  rather have their room than their company. they are also  useing evry exhertion to draw away our young women and girls to  parties and would destroy them if they could. shall we sleep  unconcerned as Elders and parents while these scenes are enacted  around us no I will not do it and I feel to exhort this con- gregation to wake up and know what is going on around them  and their families and not suffer your wives and daughters to  mingle with Military officers soldiers, Horslers and cooks and gentils  in balls parties rides and other amusements untill they are defiled   ENDENTRY and destroyed it its much easier to keep your hands out of the  fire than to cure them after they are burned. I would  far prefer to bury any wife or child I have than to  have them live to dishonor my name and disgrace themselves  by commiting sin with the gentiles. If the Bishop sees  any member of my family children or wives come here to meeting and take a seat in the back part of the House and  spend the time in play instead of attending to the preaching  I wish him to call them by name and let them be reproved  openly if they will take that course for they all know that  that to be against my council and I wish the Bishop would  pursue that course with all persons who come here and do not  do right. we should not be ashamed or afraid to rebuke  wickedness sin and abominations whence ever we know of their its  existance in our midst. for by doing right we will ever be supported  by the right hand of the Lord. there is not the least trembling  in my boydy or spirit because of the results that myay arise from  resisting and rebuking sin for I would rather die wifeless and  childless and see my dwellings laid in ruins and my own body fall  in the gap than to permit whordoms, wickedness and abominations  to exhist in our families wards and cities unrebuked and unchecked  for we as a people have to sanctify ourselves before the Lord in order to sanctify have the blessings and approbation of the  Lord upon us. It will be far better for us to restrain our  children from Evil than to suffer them to go headlong to ruin  and they will thank God to all Eternity that there parents have  given them good council and restrained them from Evil rather  than to be permitted to plunge into misery sin sorrow and woe  we should treat our wives and children with kindness and  affection and give them good council and when we have done all we  can for them then if they will do ^w^rong and go to ruin our gar- ments are clear and I hope from this time forth that we  may not look upon sin with any degree of allowance of  approbation which may God grant for Christ Amen   I was followed in my remarks by Bishop Phineas  Richards Samuel Richards all backed up my  testimony. the spirit of the Lord rested upon us and we had  a good time    ENDENTRY February 19, 1855 ~ Monday   19th I spent a part of the day in the Historians office and the  evening in the Grammar school.
