 shall all be fulfilled. aAnd though Heaven & Earth pass away, my words shall not   pass away but shall be fulfilled saith the Lord. These revelations and testimonies   you have before you. Let my Saints search the Word of the Lord and treasure  up wisdom, and be prepared for that which is to come. As I have Decreed,  so shall my Judgments Begin at the House of God. There are those in my   Church, who have a name among you, who are Adulterers, & Adulteresses, &  those who Blaspheme my Name, and those who love & make a lie and   those who revel and Drink with the Drunken, if they do not speedily repent   of this wickedness & Abomination they should be severed from the ordinances   of my House saith the Lord. And There are many who have need to repent  whose lusts are set upon the things of this world, and ^who^ aspire to the honors of  men, and do not honor the priesthood aid ^nor^ seek to build up the kingdom  of God, as they should. Neither do they learn and comprehend that the rights of   the priesthood are inseparably connected with the powers of Heaven, and  that the powers of Heaven cannot be controlled nor handled only upon   the principles of Righteousness. Such should repent and turn unto the  Lord & seek for the Holy Spirit to guide them; Blened are the Judgments  will begin upon my House, and from thence will they go forth unto the world  and the wicked cannot escape. Blessed are the pure in Heart, for my Blessings  await them in this Life, and Eternal Life in the world to come. Thus  Saith the Lord unto you my Servants the Apostles who dwell in the flesh  fear ye not your Enemies Let not your Hearts be troubled I am  in your Midst. I am your Advocate with the Father.

 destruction upon the Wicked, that I will be Enquired of by you to ask the  Father in my Name to do & to perform these things for you, As I told In out  Inc all the House of Israel by my servant Moses that they should ask   at my hand for all those Blessings which I ^the Lord^ have promised unto Israel in  the Latter Days. And as I the Lord ordained mine Apostles who were with  me in my ministry and promised them that they should sit upon Twelve Thrones  Judging the Twelve tribes of Israel, So I say unto you, mine Apostles,   that whom I have raised up in these Last days, that I have ordained you  to bear record of my name, & ^of^ the Gospel of Jesus Christ, to the Gentiles  first & then to the House of Israel. I have also ordained you to sit upon  Thrones and Judge the Gentiles and all of the inhabitants of the Earth  unto whom you have borne ^testimony^ testimny of my name in the day & Generation  in which you Live. Therefore, How Great is your calling & responsibility  before me! Therefore, gird up the loins of your minds and magnify your  calling, in the fear of God, and prepare ye for the coming of the Son of Man  which is nigh ^at^ the door.

Therefore  prepare yourselves O ye Saints of the Most High God, with Oil in your  Lamps for Blessed is he that watcheth for the coming of the Son of Man.  Again Hear ye the word of the Lord O ye mine Apostles whom I have  chosen in these Last days to bear record of my name and to lead  my people Israel untill the coming of the Son of Man, I the Lord

 have raised up unto you My Servant John Taylor to preside over  you, and to be a Lawgiver unto my Church. He has mingled his   Blood with ^that of^ the Martyred prophets. Neverthless, while I have taken my servants  Joseph and Hyrum unto myself, I have preserved my servant John Taylor for  a wise purpose in me.

You do; therefore you hold ^in common^ the keys of the kingdom of God on the  Earth is common in all the world. You each of you have power  to unlock the vail of Eternity & hold converse with God, the Father, & his son  Jesus Christ, and to have the Administration of Angels.

I was informed of the tightness of money  with the church, and I let the matter run and paid  the money out of my own pocket, still forwarding all  the tithing I received to head Quarters as per instructions  from Pres. G. Q. Cannon on ship Alaska; The amt. I  have received of this 180.00 said to be apropariated is as  follows,                 Aug 10, 1893 Chash check to S. B. Young Jr   $30.00      Sept 13 [1893] [Chash check] to myself   30.00      January 27 1894 [Chash check] [to myself] 50.00      Total received -   $110.00       I have paid out for rent one hundred and seventy  Dollars, Sixty Dollars more than I have received.  Seeing that all the corrspondenece in refard to this money  matter had been with Presedent S. B. Young. I still wrote  him on the matter asking him to do me the favour  to get the remaining seventy dollars sent to me.  It was not with any intention of evading you in the  least degree whatever; Now it was not a receipt  of seventy dollars I wanted but a check for seventy Dol  said to have been apropiated, and on the report to me 
 I have had some questions asked one  in regards to some points on which I did  not feel to answer, it is well known that  among the world thy prevent ad distroy their  children, and works of this nature are in the hands  of the people, and those practices are quite common.  And on account of these questions being asked me I   am lead to ask the following questions.    First, will repentance and baptism wash away sins of  persons that have practised hindering conception and dis-  troying the seed before life has entered the child.    Second,  will repentance and baptism wash away sins of those  who have distroyed their children before birth or after.    Third,  Those persons who joined the church and have been away  in the world for 20 or 30 years and have practised  these things how would their case be.    If the above were baptiese, any or either of them, would   they be entitled to laying on of hands, and to receive the  priesthood. Wishing you a happy new year and as  many as you desire, from your Brother in the Gospel  of Christ Job Pingree

 of said apropiation I contracted the debt  and have paid it out of my own packet.   I spend money to fit up the place about 70.00 but the  people have paid me back over half of this amount  and in time will pay it all; but while on this  matter I would like to know what I may depend on  for the future, will you help me out on this matter,  or have I got to carrey it myself. I receive very little   beside Tithing and not very much is paid of that,  but I have sent to head quarters in tithing this  year over one hundred and seventy five Dollars  and whatever money is sent I ask for receipts, and  return them to evey person who pays the tithing.   I will say that myself and my brethren who  labor here with me we have quite an expence in  traveling and most of our other expences we have  to pay ourselves.

 Most of the missionaries in the field have been and   are now young Elders without experience in the ministry, and   have spent their time and labors more freely in the distrebution  of tracts, and in family conversations which have resulted in   removing prejudice and making friends, while very few have  been inclined to connect themselves with such an unpopular  people as the "Mormons" are almost universally recognized to be.    Only a few days since Elders McFarland & Walker, now  in Steuben Co. N. Y. succeeded in Baptizing 14 persons into the  Church, which with 22 or 23 others who had previously been baptized,  mostly in this neighborhood makes the number of additions during  the year by Baptism thirty-five.    There are at present many encourageing features promiseing   increased success to the Mission. There are now several places  where more easy access may be had to the people than have heretofore  been available.    I have at several times expressed my desire for more Elders  in this Mission to members of the Missionary Committee. Prest Cannon  and others, and have late in the season received some assistance  so that now I have nine Elders with after releasing several who  have been called home on account of sickness at home or their  own impaired health. If no more are called away I will be  able with my present help to keep watchful care over the places  where Elders have been laboring, which is about all that can be

 done during the severe winter season in the northern  country where it is nearly impossible for Elders to get about,  as reported by those who are there. But early in the spring coming,   present prospect would seem to justify the call for at least a   dozen or 20 Elders to engage in missionary work to advantage.    One very interesting feature of the work I would  not fail to mention, which is the personal and very agreeable  acquaintance I have been able to form with Mr Hammond, Editor  of the "Brooklyn Eagle," and through this acquaintance a recognition  in the paper of the Latter-day Saints as a christian community; and   a presentation in the paper, side by side with other religious denom-  inations, of our doctrines and principles as reports of sermons &c.  Also to have the time and place of our Sunday meetings appear in   the Saturday paper free of charge. The Editor has also expressed a   desire through interviews with me to become acquainted with the   history of the Mormon people, and of my experience with them &c.    The fact that such a paper as the Eagle will recognize and publish  our doctines as freely from a "Mormon" Elder, as other doctrines from  the most noted Rev. of other churches is itself throwing down the  gantlet as it were to all other people, and saying, "they are as good  as you," is a mighty sermon of itself; while it will carry our doctrines  and testimony to scores of thousands of people, and in many  places where personal testimony might never reach.

 Very good letter. The money—$5575—I supp-  ose should be returned to him as soon as  possible. J. F. S.    50 Concord St, Brooklyn, N. Y.  Augt 19, 1896.    President, W. Woodruff,  and Council:    Dear Bretheren:    Permit me to acknowledge   receipt of your favor of the 12th inst, with accompanying Blanks  for reports of returning missionaries &c: and to assure   you it shall be my pleasure to do all in my power  to assist you in the realization of all that is desired,  as expressed therein.    This mission has been somewhat unfortunate in having  so many of the missionaries return home before their labors  had become really profitable to the mission, or to themselves.  Nearly all of them have been Elders without experience in  the missionary field, and quite a number with very little  knowledge of the Bible, the Gospel, or history of the Church.  Very much of this necessary information has to be acquired by careful  study after reaching their fields of labor.    Not having experienced Elders to labor with and assist this  class, it is very difficult with them to over come the embarrass-  ment which delays their appearing in public, other than by  distributing tracts and having an occasional conversation with individuals.

 some five or six articles have appeared of from half to two-thirds  of a columne in length, while reports of sermons from other churches  have had only a few inches of space in the same paper.    I have called upon the Editor of the "World" twice  and have succeeded in getting 3 or 4 short articles in that paper,  but find the Editor very careful about admitting any thing that  would be likely to encourage discussion or controversy of a re-  ligious nature; and he has extended very little encouragement  as yet. I intend however to occasionally test his generosity, as by  giving name and address I have already had important personal  correspondence making further inquiry, even from professional gentlemen.    As to this department of my missionary labors, I have already  about as much on my hands as I can well attend to, and find  it inconvenient to be away from my office any length of time, with-  out an accumulation of inquisative correspondence, both from  Elder's and others, who are strangers, extending even to other countries.    There are 6 members and some children leaving here for  Utah tomorrow, and quite a number more are making ready to   leave in the spring. They have friends already there, and are very  anxious to reach them as soon as possible. Can Bro. Spence do any  thing to assist then by way of reduced fares? I have no occasion  to preach or encourage emigration, so long as the mission must  depend upon its members for financial support, as its resources  are diminishing greatly by absence of those able to go. 
 50 Concord St Brooklyn, N. Y.  January 1st 1897.    Prest Wilford Woodruff; & Council:  Salt Lake City:    Dear Bretheren; Permit me  to greet you again with a "Happy New Year," which I am   pleased to say we are enjoying here, and I am pleased   to hand you herewith Report of our doings in the Eastern   States Mission during the past year; both of Church and   Financial affairs.    The Elders in this Mission are generally well in health,  and are enjoying their labors in the Ministry. Many friends  are being made: places are being a pencil for holding meetings  in doors more abundantly than heretofore, and numbers  of persons are expressing themselves quite satisfied with the  Gospel requirements. It is reported to me that quite a   number of persons would commence a new life with this  "New Year" day by being Baptized.    During the past year much time has been employed visiting   among the people, distributing tracts, and thereby much prej-  udice has been removed, and the first thereof is now ripening.

 The Elders of this Mission, now numbering 27 in all,  are mostly engaged in the States of New York and in   Pennsylvania, with only two in Rhode Island, and one  in Maine. The northern parts of the Mission in winter are   so severe as to almost entirely prevent travel among the   people, and it has been thought advisable to locate near  populous parts of the mission, where winter would least  interfere with the Elders in getting among the people.    At a late Conference of the Elders held at Scranton, they  were found to be so distributed as to anticipate succesful  labors for the wintery season, quite as well as the summer.    The removal of Mission HeadQuarters last July from 48 Lands St  to 50 Concord St was a change of considerable advantage to the  Mission, as well as much more desirable for an Office, and   place of meeting; also, for more comfortable as a residence,  with room to accomodate calling Elders with Lodgings, saving  to them Expensive Hotel Bills, &c    A few competent Elders of Experience in Missionary work would  greatly aid and encourage the many inexperienced who are  already here. The accompanying Sheets will furnish you  statistical information of additions, removals, and of  the Missions finances, &c.

 As to the inclosed financial account, the expenses  of the Mission will be considerably less the coming year  than it has been the past: less all the furnishings necessary to   enable those here to live at home, and by which Elders passing  back & forth can spend a day or two when desirable without  being at the expense of Hotel fare for food and Lodgings.    The item of Postage &c in the accounts has been much  of it made by purchaseing postage Stamps with which to make  remittances for the purchase of Books, Tracts, and Cards, which  will be less till those are disposed of now on hand.    In refference to any matter in this communication, or other,  I shall be pleased to have any suggestions or instructions which  it may be your pleasure to give for the Mission's welfare, and   the entire conformity to your wishes.    Myself, Sister R. and Elder Barnes are all in comfortable health,   and have joy in our labors among the people. Sister R. is a great   advantage to the mission in many ways: not only in making a com-  fortable home for those who must be at the office, but especially among  the sick she is very useful, and by her attention she has secured  warm friends to whom she has been a blessing and comforter.  They join with me in best wishes for your welfare, and praying   that God may be ever with you. Most sincerely your servant and co-  worker, for Christs sake.    Saml W. Richards, Prest "E. S.

 50 Concord St., Brooklyn, N. Y.  June 16, 1897.    Pres't. Wilford Woodruff,  Box B, Salt Lake City,   Utah.    Dear Brother: Enclosed please find financial report of the Eastern  States Mission, which is the first three month of my jurisdiction   here. I understand that you are desirous of having me report   quarterly, our financial condition, and annually the Statistical,  which I will continue to do.    As you are aware, our mission is yet in its infancey. I   have been kept quite bussy engaged since my arriva^l^ here, visiting  the various fields where the Elders are, and organizing them into   Conferences, and Branches, and I am pleased to report that things  here are assuming a prosperous condition. Our Elders are mostly   all traveling without money, and they report to me hospitable   treatment in nearly all instances. A few are being baptized in   all parts of the mission. In Philadelphia we have Nine Elders   who are working very zealoulsly, in tracting the City, and holding  meetings; they rent a house and board themselves. I have four  Elders here with me who are w[or]king in Brooklyn and New York: we  hold meetings here at 50 Concord St., Sunday aftenrnoon's and a   Bible class every Thursday evening.    Ever praying for the mutual welfare of "zion" and with   love for you and your co-workers, I remain,    Your brother, A. P. Kesler 
 This is a very good letter. Suppose you (bro.  Reynolds) see if bro. Spence can do anything  for the immigrants referred to.    This letter should be read to the Presidency.    J. F. S.    [sideways text] Saml. W. Richards  Dec. 31 [18]95. [end of sideways text] 
 Brooklyn N. Y.  Jan. 4, 1897.    By waiting to this date I had hoped I had hoped  to receive full reports of Elders up to close of the year,  but I will wait no longer, lest financial matters be wanted.    There are no wealthy members of the Church in   this mission, and when those who work by the day pay their  tithing, it seems all they can well do. Only two persons pay  regular monthly donations for the mission, and their names  do not appear on the tithing list. Other small donations  are made by parties as convenient to them.    Of Church matters, such as No. Baptized & received,   children blessed, number Emigrated &c. with Report of Elders  labors, I will forword soon, when delayed reports are received.    I feel truly thankful to Our Heavenly Father for His  blessing attending the Mission work and for the pleasing  prospects of the future which are growing brighter daily.    At a "Mission Hall" in this City, I am invited to preach  when ever I can put in an appearence. Meetings are held nightly.  I have been several time in attendance, and spoken with the   Minister's apparent appreciation—always saying—"Come again."    Praying heaven's blessings ever to attend you my dear  bretheren, and the cause to which your watchcare is given.    I remain Your's in Covenant Bonds, S. W. Richards.    See Over—
