This scenery flung into my hands or  under my superintendancy and care 42 established  places of preaching which were licensed according to  law including one chapel. this has opened the largest  field for labour and increase of numbers of any door  that has been opened in the same length of time since  the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints has  been esstablished. Their was among this number  Baptized some of most all classes and churches, 46  Preachers one clark of the Church of England, one  constable and a number of wealthy farmers, and when  I left this vast field of Labour to go to Preston  to attend the conference their was nearly 200  souls ready to be baptized as soon as an opportun ity offers.

I expect the church will  number several hundred in this region soon. I fou nd on my return that Elder Kington had baptized  10, and Priest John Cheese 20 making the whole No  188 souls. mobs have arisen against me in some  instances, on one occasion they stoned me while  baptizing. see April 9th. I had vast congregat tions attended my meetings and the country was  all stired up, and many priest and people came out  to hear what I had to say and many received  my testimony.

We visited the Ancient noted splended  Worcester Cathedral Which surpasses any thing for spel  splender and architecture mine eyes ever beheld it was about 400 feet in length 800 or 900  years of age it contained many Monuments or portraits of persons which were graven out of marble  and lade over the tombs or vaults of Ancient Bishops,  Lords, and Princis, some of which had lane there for  7 or 800 years. It is said that some of these mon uments with their winding streets which are carved  out of fine marble is as neatly executed as  any thing found in Europe. almost evry thing about  this cathedral from top to bottom is carved out of  solid marble the whole pulpit is carved out of  one solid stone. There was a large Organ  in the building. The Church of England still  worship in this building, they hold a time of  worship twice each day in a year, we stayed there one service. The whole concern is superior  to the architecture of the present generation. from Worcester we rode to Ledbury and on the  ride we passed through the Town of Malvern on  Malvern Hill the most Noted Hills in England in  consequence of they being the highest and the   ENDENTRY most splended prospect of all the surrounging  country for 30 miles, and on some of the highest  peaks are large intrenchments whare men  retreated to in the time of the roman war,  The buildings in the village of Malvern are  splendid standing on the side of these Hills.

P. Pratts remarks upon the "eternal duration  of matter", I commenced assending this noted hill upon the south side of it and after arising several hundred feet I came to the top of an old ancient intrenchment about one mile  in length reaching round all of this part of the hill and meeting   ENDENTRY together. then after rising another hundred feet I entered another Intrenchment like the one below and after this  another and thus Intrenchment lay above Intrenchment  untill we ^I^ reached the top of the hill which was nearly flat  or level and lay in a circle or round and not being more  than one or two acres on the top and thus I stood upon the  top of this Bacon or hill from 10 to 1500 feet in highth  and while surveighing the surrounding Country I could also behold the deep Intrenchments below me which it is  supposed were flung up nearly a thousand years since and  was capable of holding hunderds of thousands of persons  which was the resort of the romans in the times of their  wars, these hills are alltogether bare without timber but covered with grass which is grazed by sheep and asses; several acres on the S.W. side is covered with rabit burrows whil  scores of rabits are running about upon the ground. but I  soon drew my thoughts from the busy rabit, sheep, and asses to the solumn reflections which the ravages of time presen ted before me. O! Malvern thy lofty Hill bares up my feet while mine eyes take a survey of thy deep intrenchments thy mighty bulwarks ^which have^ trembled by the roar of cannon, the  clash of arms, and din of war has reeched around thy brow  and died away in the vale beneath, while the blood of many a roman and Englishman to, have washed thy brow and soaked thy soil while they have fallen to rise no more they sleep in death and time has earth'd them all and they are forgotten  and blotted from the history and memory of man. Notwithst anding O! Malvern thou hast been the Ark or refuge for thousands  in the time of trouble or war, yet Willford is the ownly solitary soul that treads thy soil this day and he alone bends his  knee upon on the highth of thy summet in the midst of the clouds  to offer up the gratitude of his heart unto that God who will  soon level all hills exhalt all valies and redeem the earth from the curse of sin and prepare it for the abode of the Saints of the MOST HIGH. I retired from the hill into  the vale reflecting upon the rise, progress, decline, and fall of the  empires of the earth, and the revolutions which must still transpire before the winding up scene and the comeing of Christ   I preached at candle light at Brother wind point and had the spirit of God and Baptized 4 and confirmed them I spent the night at Mr Joseph Symons distance 5 mil    ENDENTRY May 12, 1840 ~ Tuesday   12th A member of the Weslian Methodist Church came  to me to inquire what she should do to be saved I told her she must be born of the water and spirit, repent and be paptized for the remission of sins. she received my testimony and  wished me to baptize her, I also called upon a woman that tended the gate at Chancys pitch and preached the word unto her   ENDENTRY in the midst of one universal dens mass of brick and Stone buildings, covering about six miles squair of ground while viewing this scenery in a clear day we were  conversing with a Prussian traveller (citizen of Berlin) who had travled much over Asia and other  parts of the world, and he declaired we could not  find another spot upon the face of the earth that  would present to our view as grand a scenery as  the one before us.

The following is inscribed upon  one side of the monument in LATIN  In the year of Christ 1666 the second  day of September from hence at the distance of two hund red and two feet the hight of this column about midnight  a most terrible fire broke out which driven on by a high  wind not ownly wasted the adjacent parts but also places vary remote with incredible noise and fury. It consumed 89 Churches, the gates of the city Guild hall many public struc- tures, hospitals, schools, libraries a vast number of Stately edifices. 13,200 dwelling houses 400 streets of 26 wards it utterly destroyed 15 and left 8 others shattered and half  burnt. The ruins of the city were 436 acres from the  Tower by the Thames side to the Temple Church and  from the North east Gate along the city wall to Holborn  Bridge. To the estates and fortunes of the citizens it  was merciless but to their lives vary favorable (ownly eight being lost). That it might in all things resemble the  last conflog^r^ation of the world. The destruction  was sudden for in a small space of time the same  city was seen most flourishing and reduced to  nothing three days after when the fatal fire  had Baffled all human councils and endeavours,  the opinion of all, as it were, by the will of heaven it stoped and on evry side was extinguished past  6 m.

In fine the whole sectarian  world is in confusion and trouble and knows not what  to do. Mr Akens said in his sermon said that the gentils  with all their present glory would soon be glad to take  hold of the skirt of a Jew and say let us go with you  he also says that most are ignorant of the meaning and  fulfillment of the Bible and will remain so untill it  is revealed by the spirit of God. but notwithstanding  Mr Akins has sum sublime truths yet he is building a great  house without any foundation by rejecting the  first principles of the gospel. We also attended  meeting at Zions Chapel Waterloo Road and herd  Mr Robert Aitken deliver an interesting warning  to the gentiles in the evening, he presented some  of the most sublime truths that I ever herd delivered  by a sectarian priest. also he whiped the present  religionist of the day at a tremendious rate, he said  they would go to Hell as a body for their religion was  ownly a cloke to cover adulterers and evry evil work  he said the judgments of God would spedily overtake  them. he prophesied of many judgments that would  spedily come, he wept over the present state of  things we retired and spent the night at our logings 4 mi    ENDENTRY August 24, 1840 ~ Monday   24th We removed our logings whare we obtained a  room for all three of us at Mr Robert Merryfield  No 15 Gloster row, Grange Road   FIGURE I wrote a letter to Elders Richards we visited St Pauls Cathedral and went all through  the lower court and could see the splender of most of  it. It is the largest and most splended and expensive Church   ENDENTRY in the world at the present time excepting the Vatican ^Church^  at Rome dedicated St Peter. It is 500 feet long from E to W.  and 285 wide from N to S. and 404 fet. high  and it contains 47 monuments of fine marble erected  over the tombs of certain Lords, Bishops, Generals, Earls  and other Titles who have distinguish themselves in the  military service of Great Britiain and otherwise Lord  Nelsons Monument is the largest and most noted. their  Bodies are placed in vaults under the building and their  monuments mostly erected on the floor above. This  Cathedral bears up three lofty Spires and the whole  Building is splended inside and out. It was first built  by St Augustine in the year 610. It was destroyed  by fire in 961 and rebuilt the following year. It was  not till the reign of London became  the metropolis of England and it was to this prince more  perhaps than to any of his predecessors that the cath edral of St Paul was indebted for its permanant esta- blishment and preeminance. In 1086 this cathedral was  again destroyed by fire which also involved the greater  part of the Metropolis in ruin.

Elder Smith informed the people that there was two other Amer- ican preachers present that would address them if they had an oppertunity and when the Calvenist preacher closed, Elder Kimball asked him if there  would be any objection to our preaching there at 3 oclock he says No not all. What denomination do  you belong to? to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, O I have herd of them, they are a bad  people, they have done much hurt, they divide Churches we dont want to hear you. He then got up into his  chair and said to the people I have just herd that the  last man that spoke belongs to the latter Day Saint  and he spoke all manner of evil of us, and scandalized  us before the people without hearing us ^or^ knowing any thing about our principles.

I was then followed by Elder Kimball who   ENDENTRY spoke about the Same length of time the people gave good attention to what we said and seemed to be much interested in what they heard, and we dismissed our  meeting in the midst of good feelings. Mr Corner invited  us home, soon after we arived at his house Elder Kimball felt impressed to returned Back to the place  of preaching, and when he got there he found a large company talking about the things which they  had herd, and they wished him to speak to them again  and he did so and spoke lengthy and several invited him home, and while he was there, a man that was a  preacher came to Mr Corners whare Br Smith and I  was and I gave them a brief account of the great work which God was doing in these last days and they  received the things which I spoke unto them and Mr  Corner offered himself for Baptism which is the  first man that has offered himself for Baptism in the City of London to us we appointed next evening  to administer the ordinance unto him and his houshold or as many as would receive it we took supper  with him and returned home by the way of London  Bridge the whole Bridge and streets was covered with  people so thick that a person could scearcely get along I returned home weary and spent the night at our  logings But was unwell through the night with the Bowel Complaint.

We entered the Tunnel on the  South Side of the Rotherhithe and after going about about 80 feet down into the  earth we entered the archway on the left which  was finished 1120 feet which was beatifully  lighted up with gas we walked through it under the  river Thames, with the river and Shiping over our  heads and in some places not more than 15 feet betw een the top of the arch and the bed of the river there  is two archways the whole length of the tunnel and openings which afford free communication from one archway to the other, this is considered the greatest Piece of Invention and most splended work ever acc omplished by man in modern times. We wrote our  names and profession and residence in a record about und er the centre of the river we then came out of  the Tunnel, and rode in a skiff 2 miles to the Tower  of London which was built by the romans but is now  occupied for the garrison armory and Jewelry of the  British Navy and army andc we did not spend much time it visiting this for it was late and we could not go thr ough the different appartments on our return home we saw near London Bridge exhibited a representation  as large as life in full costume the death of Marco Butzaris Don De Berri, the Infa- nt Don Sebastian, Maroto Cyril and other officers.

Elders Smith went  in to the city to visit the people found some that  harkened to their testimony. London is the hardest  place I ever visited for esstablishing the gospel. It is full of evry thing but righteousness, but we do  not feel discouraged in the least we are determined  in the name of the Lord to set up the Standard of truth in this city and to seek out the honest in heart and the meek from among men and warn all as far as in our  power that the world may be left without excuse   ENDENTRY September 3, 1840 ~ Thursday   3rd I felt some better this morning But am confin ed most of the day to my room Elders Kimball and  Smith took a walked into the City    ENDENTRY September 4, 1840 ~ Friday   4th Elders Debt ford, and I took a walk into the city called upon Br Corner found him in good Spirits.

I conversed with several  others who received my testimony one woman said she would be baptized. I returned home by the way  of the Smithfield Market which occipies about 20  acres of ground, and it was in the time of the fair and I never saw such a scenery before. In fact  it would be a difficult task for a historian to descr ibe the particulars of 20 acres of ground covered  over with Cattle, Sheep, Caravans of Beast, Lions Tigers Leapard Bears, Wolves, Elephants Camels Zabras horned horses, wild Boars, monkeys, serpants, and evry description of beasts, Animal and reptile exhibited in Euro- pe. these connected with large bands of music. men  woman, and children of almost evry grade and rank prostitutes and merchantdize of evry name and nature Oshters, Shrimps, mustles, crabs, lobsters fish, cakes bread, meet, beer, soda, crockery toys clothing of all  kinds old and new, umbrellas, pears, Apples, plums, and grapes and almost evry thing els that anybody ever  saw. A Giant women was exhibited 7 feet high a sheep weighing 600 lbs. and a live serpent 12 feet in length which a women would wind around her bare neck and bosom to show her courage andc.  Should a Missourian from the western wiles of  America whose knowledge extends ownly to his  gun, corn crib and hog pen behold such a scenery he would think he was in another world, what affect it would have upon him I know not but  one thing is certain that any man that loved  virtue peace and retirement would turn from  such a scenery with his heart sicken within him  knowing that virtue peace nor righteousness could  not long dwell in such a sink of confusion and  iniquity 8 m   ENDENTRY September 5, 1840 ~ Saturday   Sept 5th FIGURE Elders Smith, and myself Visited Westminster Abbey  and went through evry appartme nt of it and saw all the tombs and monuments of the Kings, Queens, Princes, Lords, and noted men that have  ever been entombed within its walls one part of  the Abbey was built in the year 600 having stood  over 1200 years most all of the Kings and Queens of England are in this Abbey that have died for the  last 1200 years we saw the perfect likenes of Queen  Pitt and others we saw the full Coronation dress of Queen Ann. We saw the chair and sat in it in which Queen Victoria  was crowned and all the kings and Queens for the last 800 years, this chair is covered with gold tissue It  contains a stone under the seat upon which all the Scottish chiefs and kings were crowned since they wer a people it is reported to be Jacobs pillar this chair has  been in use more than 800 years. This Abbey is composed of Eleven Chapels (ownly seperated by walls or petitions)  viz Henry the Seventh Islip. St Michael. and these Chapels  contain the bodies, tombs and monuments of 13 Kings viz V.â€”VII. Sebert  King of the East Saxons who first built this Church and  Died July 616. Also 13 Queens viz Athelgodo Queen of Sebert who died Sept 13th, 615. And Matilda  Catherine. Queen Anne, and Caroline.

Here we see freequent marks of violence from O. Cromwell in defacing some of the tombs, monuments and brass work with which some of the Abbey was adorned. Here we beho ld the art of man with all its combined force and power spun to  the finest thread and expanded to the fullest extent in the building and finishing of this Abbey as a general whole but more esspecially  that part called Henry Seventh Chapel. And A Visit to this ABBEY is not ownly worthy ot the Attention of all travel- lors but to occupy A place in the Journal of any Historian fond of British ANTIQUITY 6 m   ENDENTRY September 6, 1840 ~ Sunday   6th Sunday I preached in the morning at Bowl  Court 237 Shoreditch was followed by Elders  Smith. Also we held a meeting in  Tabernacle square at 3 oclock and Elders Kimball and Smith  preached in the street and I followed them in  Bearing testimony one man arose and opposed us and  was angry becaus of the truth of God, and conti nued opposing untill the conversation was stoped  by the Police. We met again in the evening at  Bowl Court to preach to the people as we had an  appointments But when we got there, we found  a plan contrived by several of the preachers for  one of them to preach lest some of the peopl would  believe our doctrin and when we saw this we went  our way, and found four other persons that received  our testimony and offered themselves for Baptism 10 m    ENDENTRY September 7, 1840 ~ Monday   7th FIGURE I wrote a letter to Elder Browett and walked to Br Corners and visited several  other friends. {Brother Corner would make me a illegible watch for} 5 10 two offered themselves for Baptism. On  my return home I passed through Smithfield market and it was fare time with them and such a  scenery I never saw before I visited St Pauls Church  or Cathedral after visiting the lower room which  we visited on the 24th Aug. I then walked on circular  stairs into the whispering gallery which is round and  exceding large and a person can hear a whisper distinctly  from any part of it. I nex visited the Cupola  and all parts above it untill I got to the ^FIGURE^ I then went in to  the top of the Brass ball upon which the cross stand whic  is as high as any man can go It brought me 400 feet  in the air over the city. I wrote my name and returned to the Earth On ariving at our boarding hours I found Elder  Smith who had just returned from  a visit with the Rev. R. Aitken A.M. he  treated them kindly acknowledged their doctrin  to be true but was afraid of deception his  mind is in a disturbed state.   We held a meeting  in the Temperance hall in the evening which  was well lighted with gas But we had almost  bear walls to preach to as their was ownly  about 30 persons present. The truth is the  minds of the people here in London are taken up  with evry thing but the things of God and righteous ness. I preached to the people about one hour  and was followed by Elder Kimball. after paying  7/6 for the use of the Hall we returned to our lodgings.   ENDENTRY September 8, 1840 ~ Tuesday   8th FIGURE I spent a part of this day in vis- iting places and things connected with  the Crown.

Built and occupied for many years by  the Celebrated Rev Rowland Hill, whose body now  lies under the Chapel from thence we continued  west to West minster Bridge which we walked over  which brought us direct to West minster Abbey  and to the house of parliment. we walk through the  house of Commons and of Lords We sat in the Chair  whare the speaker of the house of Lords had sat  for many years. In this room all the speaches were  made by Mr William Pitt concerning America before  the Revolution. In this room all the laws were  made that ha now governs from 172,452,000  to 200,000,000 of human beings. As the house of  Commons was burned down about 6 years since this  room is now occipied by the house of Commons and  there is annother house now built which the hous of  Lords at the present time occupy. One would naturly  suppose that a room fitted up to contain the hous of  Lords of Commons would be sumthing extra, grand  expensive and fine but it is not so but the revers it is  exceding plain and undecorated. On entering the room  one would sooner think he was in an American School  house rather than in a house of Lords or of Commons from this we visited St James Park, whare we saw the  a company of 200 foot Soldiers or guards on parade  accompanied by a full band of music. After which we  saw the Queen's Horse guard on parrade one hun dred in number with there bodies covered with Steel  which glissened much in the sun they were all  mounted upon Black mares which were fast and gay we visited the monument erected in honor to His  grace the Duke of York it was 135 in highth. here I  parted with Elders Smith. I walked the  whole length of St James park It has a pool in the  Centre and mansions and pallaces around it. I first visit ed the mansion of Queen DOWAGER widow of the  Late King William IV I next visited the mancion  of the Duke of Southerland which was quite splended I then visited Buckingham Palace one of the  most splendid palaces in Europe or the world this palace is for the Royal family it is now  occupied by her Majesty Queen Victoria and his  Highness Prince Albert, it covers a number of   ENDENTRY acres of ground, and evry door, enterance, and gate  was strongly guarded by armed soldiers. I walk ed nearly around this palace and while there I  had the privilege of seeing his Royal Highness  PRINCE ALBERT While he rode from his  Palace across St James Park he was mounted  on a gray horse was followed by his groom  on a sorrel horse. He was not accompanied by  her Magesty Victoria or any other person except  his groom, he was dressed in a frock coat and  dark pantloons, he looks well fresh and healthy  and in the bloom of life as he is but about 20 years  of age. I did not see her majesty as she was at  Winsor at the present time. I also visited the  National Gallery, and saw all the paintings which  the nations has gathered together which are consi dered the most sublime of any in the world after leaving the gallery and visiting St Martins  Church, I thought I had seen as much as my brain  would contain in one day. I then walked about 3  miles through the City and again met with my Breth ren, at Br St Lukes  London and after spending a little time with the  friends we again returned to our lodgings and spent  the night.

Aitken's A.M. receiving and embr acing the work which will open doors to many  honest souls so I felt to rejoice that our lab ours were not altogether in vain. I took the  Omnibus and rode 3 miles to the great western  rail way Padington Depot. I took the railcar  at 9 oclock and rode 70 miles passed by Winser Castle  with the British flag raised as a token that  her Magesty was there.

But they would not permit  me to go with them lest I should receive an injury from  the shower of stones but several of the Brethren went  themselfs into the midst of the mob and took the name  of the leaders and returned to the house in the midst of  Stones, and Brick bats, though without Injury the mob   ENDENTRY soon broke up and after clearing our rooms of brick stones  and glass we lay down and had a good nights rest 5 mil FIGURE I wrote a letter to Elders Smith    ENDENTRY September 17, 1840 ~ Thursday   17th I spent most of the day in Dymock and in the  evening I walked to Ledbury and spent the night  at Br Pullins 5 miles    ENDENTRY September 18, 1840 ~ Friday   18th I walked to Froom's hill and found the Saints  in good spirits I learned by letter that Elder  Liverpool on the eighth of Sept on board  of the North American with 200 Saints I was inform ed that Benbow and all the Saints left in good spirits I spent the night at Brother John Coles    ENDENTRY September 19, 1840 ~ Saturday   19th I spent the day at Brother Coles in writing    ENDENTRY September 20, 1840 ~ Sunday   20th I preached in the morning at Froomes Hill and also  communed with the Saints at 3 oclock and also with  the Saints at Standly Hill at 6 oclock and I had an  interesting day    ENDENTRY September 21, 1840 ~ Monday   Minutes of the ^Froom's^ Hill CONFERENCE   The Frooms Hill Conference of the Church of  Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints met at Standly  Hill Herefordshire on the 21st of Sept 1840 according  to previous Appointment.

This has been an important year  to myself, to all the saints and to the world at  Large in many respects. Never have I spent a  year with more Interest than 1840 never have  I been called to make greater Blessings Sacrifices  or enjoyed greater Blessings. I have been called to  make a sacrafize of the society of my wife and children  not once beholding their faces, one of which is taken  from time, (Sarah Emma is gone to be seen no more in this  life) The whole year has been spent in a foreign nation  combating error with everlasting truth, meeting with  many contradictions of sinners who oppose themse lves against the the Truth, Being stoned mobed  and opposed, Yet the Lord hath blessed me with a  great harvest of souls as seals of my ministry, many  hundreds have received the word with joy and gladness  and are now rejoicing in the new and Everlasting Covenant  which saints live in a lively hope of meeting in  the celestial glory of our God.

It has bourn its report to  heaven, whether it be good or bad, its secnes  will not again return upon the stage of action  to be presented to the eye of man. To the  reflecting mind it is evident, that no period of the nineteenth centaury hath presented greater  and more important events to the world, and lade a  foundation for still greater things to follow in  quick succession than 1840. It is also equ ally true in various ages of the world that  those subjects and things which have been in  reality of the greatest importance to the whole  world even Subjects upon which the vary tempo- ral existance and prosperity of the Nations of the  Earth hung, have been the most out of sight, the  last to attract the Publick mind, and when discov- erd, considerd of the least consequence, scorned  and ridiculed to the last by a thoughtless multitude  who like the ox going to the slaughter know not  ENDENTRY the day of their visitation. This was evident ly the case in the Days of Cyrus  of the Days of Jesus Christ before the  overthrow of Jerrusalem and the dispersion  of the Jews, among all the gentile nations  whare they have remained Deprived of the  privileges of the land of their fathers untill  the present day. We are informed it will  be in like manner at the Coming of the  Son of Man. What are the signs of the  times in this present generation even in  1840, As it was in the days of Lot and Noah  So it may be now, then the majority of  the world, did not dissern those things that  were of the most interest, but they felt the  most interested in those things that soon- est perished. In like manner the present  generation as a mass among all the gentile  nations do not seem to dissern or take  any interest in any of the signs of the  times of 1840 except those leading  direct, to the Money and stock Exchanges here the zeal, struggle and Interest of  the world seems to centre to Devise  ENDENTRY some means whareby they can devise some means secure unto themselves, dollars and cents, Pounds shillings and pence, and eartly  dominion and power, but in the midst of this  mighty struggle, there is a small portion of  the community among the nations of the  earth, who are looking upon other singns of  this present generation as indicating a day  big with events, even the restoration of pri- mitive Christianity, the proclamation of the ful- ness of the Everlasting gospel among all natio- ns both Gentile and Jew, the restoration of the  Jews to their own land, the rebuilding of  Jerrusalem, great changes, Judgments, wars  and revolutions of the gentile nations, the  Second Advent of the Mesiah in the clouds  of heaven, and the great Millennium or rest  of the Saints of one thousand years all  of which events have been predicted by  the Holy Prophets who have Spoken since  the world began. None feel more interested  in the signs of the Heavens and the earth which  clearly indicate these great and important ENDENTRY events than the Latter Day Saints. Let us for a moment take a survey of 1840  which has been a year of interest among all  Nations. This is the tenth year of the church  of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. the church  has never been as prosperous as through 1840  though she has just passed through a seene  of unparelled persecution by the whole  state of Missouri, who has driven, robed  and murdered many of ther saints, and entirly  expeled from the state about 12,000 of  the Church, but as the persecution at Antioch  proved to spread the work abroad evrywhare  so it has been in this case, it has spread as  it were with tenfold rapidity not ownly  throughout America, but in Scotland  Ireland, some of the Lamanite or  American Indians have began to embrace the  fulness of the gospel which is an important  event in the History of the rise and progress  of the church. While many of the Elders  have been lifting up their voices in the  most noted villages and cities of America  The Twelve have been planting the work and ENDENTRY esstablishing churches in some of the most  notable cities of Europe. During the year  1840 churches have been esstablished in  Worcester, Edingborgh  and many other parts of England Scotland Wales and South  Australia, the Germany more than 4,000 has been added to the church by Baptism in Europe in 1840, and two of the Twelve have Started on a mission from Nauvoo to visit the Jews in the Holy land  of Jerrusalem. This indicates at least that  the Lord has set his hand to prune his vineya- rd one more for the last time to prepare the  way for his second advent, and that he will  make a short work in the Eearth. and cause light and truth to prevail in the midst of this  seenery, the hand of God is evidently began to be lade in a degree upon the nations in Judment In the United States many have suffered The City of Natchez was instantly destroyed  by a whirlwind. Nearly the whole country  from the mouth of the New Orleans ENDENTRY for more than 1,000 miles was inundated  by water which has prooved vary destruct- ive to all that country, and many parts that the  water could not reach Insects have help destroy there has also been great losses sustained in other  parts of that land by storm, hail and fire, and in  additions to many other events in America  1840 has brought a change of Politicks through out that nation which will of course make a  revolution in Government Affairs in many respects. Wars and rumours of wars are among the signs  of England feels at the present time as though she was swaying the sceptre over nearly all the earth, even for the first time  waving the british flag in China, still she  is not without her troubles, she is begining  to share in that distress of nations and which per plexity, which will be prominant among the signs  of the last days, great poverty prevails among  the working class in England and more esspecially in Ireland, much crying for bread is heard in the streets. Erance has had great troubles from  sources she least expected, for while she had ENDENTRY been to great expens in fiting out an army of 500,000 men to assist Mehemit Ali and for other  purposes. Endeavering at the same time to fort ify Paris by surrounding it with a strong wall, but in the midst of this scenery they have been suffering under one constant torrent  of Judgment, the sea has hove itself beyound its bounds the rivers Rhone  overflowed their banks turned out of therr course and these created a flood unparellelled in that land  which washed away both corn and wine into the  french Lake, cities Inundated, villages destroyed Cattle drowned, towns burnt farmers ruined  which created great trouble at home without  war. The French Chambers appropriated 5,000,000  of Frances Francs to relieve the present wants of the suffers  of those inundations. But among the signs  of 1840, none are more prominant than those of the eastern world, even in the Holy Land Mehemit Ali has made much noise in the world by invading Syria and trying to take power  unto himself, and as the Tirkish power was  not sufficient to check him in his progress England with other European Powers have  ENDENTRY interfered, and caused Mehemet Ali to lie passive  at their feet, but the effect of all these  movements have been to prepare the way for the return of the Jews to the land of there  Fathers, and while the Lord is begining to give  the Jews favor in the eyes of Kings that they  may become their nursing fathers and Queens their  nursing mothers, they begin to see it time for  them to make a right use of so favorable an  opportunity and immediately return and rebuild Jerrusalem, and the call is now is now going forth among the Jews in all nations to ret- urn and esspecially among the German continen tal Jews. A call of this Kind is published in  the (Der orient) a German Newspaper and among many other things says "In no country of  the earth are our brethren so numerous as in  Syria, in none do they live in as dens masses  so independant of the surrounding inhabitants in none do they persevere so steadfastly in their  faith in the promise of the Fathers as on the bea- utiful shores of the Orontes. In Damascus  alone live near 60,000. FIGURE The power of  our enemies is gone, the angel of discord has  ENDENTRY long since hown down their mighty hosts, and yet  ye do not bestir yourselves people of Jehovah what hinders, nothing but your own supineness. "People of Jehovah raise yourselves from  your thousand years slumber! Rally round  leaders; have really the will. a moses will not be  wanting. The rights of nations will never grow old, take possession of the land of your fath ers, build a third time the Temple on Zion  greater and more magnificent than ever. Trust  in the Lord who has led you safely through  the vale of misery thousands of years. He  also will not forsake you in your last con flict."  These things are clearly in  fulfillment of the predictions of the Prophets from Moses to Christ, and clearly shows the  present day is big with events. Jews and Christians have now an equal privilege in  Jerrusalem and among other privileges are  permitted to gather their own taxes which  has not before been allowed them. The  eastern world has also sufferd by Earth quake and Storm. Several late Earthquakes in the Ionian Islands many lives have perished ENDENTRY On the 1st of Dec a dreadful storm raged on  the black sea which caused great destruction  of shiping and life, 18 Greek vessels 3 English  and a much greater number, of Austrian  Sardinians, and Napolitans, were utterly lost even in the channel 7 were cast away. Thus the Lord is beginning to vex all nations with whirlwind, flood, war Earthquakes, Fire, and many Judgments, ass well as signs in the Heavens and Earth of the coming of  the Son of Man still the Nations will not learn wisdom neither practice righteousness  by the things which they suffer neither  do they dissern the signs of the times even  of 1840. What 1841 will bring to pass  time must determine. Their will be an  increas of signs in the Heavens and earth, and  still greater losses by storm tempest and Earthquakes, on the land and sea and by fire.  Trouble will be seen in the United States Gover- ernment wars and rumours of wars will increas among all nations, the return of the Jews  will be hastened. The Distress of nations with Perplexity will be felt more than ever throughout ENDENTRY the earth. In fine evry year from this day  henceforth will be attended with an increase  of strange things sights, signs, and wonders  perplexities, tribulations, Judgments, wars  and rumours of wars, Revolutions and changes  overturns and Destructions, attended with  blood, fire and smoke the sun turning to dar- kness the Moon into Blood and the stars falli- ng from heaven, Untill Babylon the great  comes in rememberance before God, and is  cast down to rise no more, and the Son of  Man Desends in the clouds of Heaven to  Deliver Israel and reign with his SAINTS  ENDENTRY The following is from the London weekly  Dispatch Sunday Jan 17th 1841   1st Upwards of 100 seaman connected with  New Castle upon Tine perished in the storm  of Novembem   2nd The American Presidents Message to  Congress, a contrast drawn by the Editor  between England and America which was  interesting   3rd England without a parliament, Publicola   4th The Schooner Veritas burned and one man   5 The Royal Speech  To be deliverd frome the Throne by her  Majesty on the opening of Parliament on the  26th Inst.

He told him it was the cup in  which His Saviour drank new wine in his kingdom  with his disciples and that the figures carved upon  it was intended to signify the union between Christ  and his people implying that the grapes derived  all their beauty and flavour from the vine so  the Saints even in a State of Glory were  indebted for their esstablishment in holyness and  happyness to the union with their head in  whom they are all complete. While they  were thus conversing he herd a tap at the  door and was informed by the Angel that it  was the signal of the Lords Approach and was intend- ed to prepare him for the interview accordingly  in a vary short time he thought our Saviour entered the room and upon his casting himself  at his feet he graciously raised him up and with  a smile of inexpressible complacency assured  him of his faithful services finding acceptance  and as a token of his peculiar regard and the  intimate friendships with which he intended to  honour him, he took the cup and after drinking  of it himself gave it into his hands, the Dr  would have declined at first as two great a  favor but our Lord ^replied^ (as he did to Peter when he  refused to let him wash his feet) if you drink not  with me you have no part with me, this saying  he observed filled him with such transport of  gratitude love and admiration that he was about  to sink under it. his Master seemed sensible  of it and told him that he must leave him for  the present but it would not be long before ENDENTRY he would repeat his visit and that in the mean  time he would find enough to employ his thoughts in reflecting on what had passed and contem- plating the objects around him as soon as our  Lord withdrew and his mind was more composed  he observed the room was hung around with  pictures and examineing more attentively he  discoverd to his great surprised that they contained  the history of his own life the most remarkable  seenes he had passed through these represented in  a most lively manner it may esily be imagined  how much this would effect his mind the  many temptations and trials he had been exposed  to and the signal instances of the divine goodness  to him in different parts of his life which were  by this means all represented at once to his view  excited the strongest emotions of gratitude  esspecially when he reflected that he was  out of the reach of any further danger and that the purposes of divine love and mercy towards him  were at length so happily accomplished, the  exstacy of joy and thankfulness in to which these  reflections threw him were so great that he  awoke but for some considerable time after  he arose the impression continued so lively  that tears of Joy flowed down his cheeks and  he said he never on any occasion remembered  to have felt sentiments of Divine love and  gratitude equally STRIKING   I copied the above from a written Parphment in  LONDON Feb 1st 1841   ENDENTRY The following is a part of the Doctrinal Catechism  of the Church of England   1 who are your lawful spiritual Pastors  The Ministers of the Church of England   2.

At about  the same time the female figure representing  the goddess of liberty on the east side of the  capitol holding the balances in one hand and the cap  of liberty in the other, lost her hand which held  the balances; it broke of itself just below the  elbow and the balances fell.

Scarcely a news paper which is not surcharg- ed with terrible acounts of murder, theft,  robberies, houseburning or the like. Moral  restraints no longer holds men in check.  The ligaments of law are but feble barriers  to licentious man. Ambition, rage revenge, or  lust are the laws by which he is governed.  The most slight insult is a pretext for  shedding a fellow creature's blood, as if the  blood of a murdered man had no voice  before the throne of the Lord God of heav- en and earth. Dirks, Pistols, Bowie-knives,  andc are daily worn by thousandsâ€”worn even  at the plough.  I tremble for the fate of my Countryâ€”for the fate of the human  family! whare will these things end? what a  horrid state of things at this time compared  with the moral situation of the world thirty  years ago! what a recklessness of life! How  Impotent are the laws of God and man in check- ing the mighty tide of crime! What is  to be the state of society; thirty years   ENDENTRY page torn vice should go unchecked at a page tornth the last ten years?â€“ O, heaven! my  page torn sickens! No human being on the earth will  page torne the fact tested. Long before thirty years  the world will be smitten by the strong arm  of Omnipotence! The most imposing events  are hanging over the worldâ€”at the vary doors â€” events which will put all past events in the  shadeâ€” obliterating all the epochs of the  human familyâ€” stamping a new era on the  annals of time! These things are true, and  are come on the world the pulpit is crying  our peace and safety! these things are true  and are come on the world as a snare: aye as a snare or the scripures are not true.  Why as a snare? because the pulpit is crying  "peace and safety"! O what a crash of governments thrones and empires is awaiting the world, and the  pulpit is chaunting lullabies to its slumbering  care! war, pestilence and fire, standing in  dread array against the human family, and  the conservators of its moral weal, hailing  the dawn of universal pieceâ€”hailing the  a millenial dawn, when the harbengers of  war and carnage are standing in bold relief over a guilty world.   They are dreaming about times of refreshing from the presence of the Lord; when we are to have the vials of his wrath! They are  clothing in Brilliant Drapery, the future trium- phs of the gospel when the drama is about to  close and present a theatre of blood. They  are in imagination, smoothly gliding by the  gradual flow of time into a heaven of repose  without once turning an eye to an intervening  vortex, which is to engulph, perhaps, more  than half the human family! They are  spreading a banquet of peace and proclaiming   ENDENTRY the acceptable year of the Lord, when he is  about to deluge the world in fire! This tremen- dious event is passed over by the pulpit as  a doomsday work of Almighty God, when it is  to be pre millennial and probably consummated  on the present generation.   A deluge of water once depopulated the world  for crime; a similar scourge, by a different elem- ent, has a similar mission to perform and for a like  cause. The measure of human crime is coming  to the full, and the arm of Omnipotence lifted  to "shake terribly the earth" and the watch  quarrelling about creeds, territory or gold.  The present Christian dispensation is about to  close like the Jewishâ€”the heavens about to  be rolled together like a scroll; the star in that  heaven about to be thrown from their  orbits, in wild consternation and the indications  overlooked; prophetic allusions to the  terrible wreck, mistaken, misapplied or applyed  to the wreck of Nature; an event without  foundation in holy writ. These things are  true.â€” They are not the freaks of a heated  imagination; but predicated upon a long  candid, cool, unbiassed investigation of  the living oracles; and on the premises we  throw the gontlet to all the clergy, learned  or unlearned on earth!
