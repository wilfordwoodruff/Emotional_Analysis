 Bear River City,   Jan. 19th[18]97.    To Pres. W. Woodruff,  S. Lake City, Ut.    Dear Brother: Allow me to   call your attention to one fact   which is this: Is not the Lehi   Sugar Factory's financial standing  O.K.?  If a party wishes to increase  his sugar shares, can he not do it?    I was given the answer no. by the   company's Secretary, as he told me, they   did not need any more shares.  And now I have been offered to   sell my shares at a price $3.50  below par. The offeer was given  me by Heber J Grant & Co.  Fire Ins. Co., whose Secretary, I   think is also Secretary for the Sugar   Co., I had subscribed to the

Dear Brother:    Yours of the 9th. inst.  was recieved and read, and,  this being my first convenience  to answer I will state that  inasmuch as you are desirous  of me to go to the Southern  States on a mission, I will  with the aid and assistance  of my Heavenly Father gladly  respond to the call made of  me: and will be at the  Historians Office at the time  required, Mar. 23.

 AMERICAN HOUSE  WILL A. COLE, PROPRIETOR.    Fitchburg, Mass., 189    a distant relation   of yours that admires   what you have done.    I have a good position  here that brings me  good salery that I  have got by hard   honest work.    And I hope the name  of wWoodruff will ever  be spoken of as a  honest name.    I wish you the  best he^a^lth and success  in all your work  for the up building   of the people, and 
 Sugar Factory with the intension of   being a shareholder, also to   increase my stock if I so desired.  Now my opinion is, That if a poor man   has acquired a little means, and   when such means are wanted to help   start a certain industry, it is not right   nor just that a rich man or men,  nor any corporation, to induce or try to   buy out such a man with but one or   a few shares only, at a price not  much more than half its value, or  rather to kick him out, so that it   can be in the hands and controled  but by a few rich. Now Brother  Woodruff I respectfully ask your  advice on the matter, as I have   taken the liberty to inform you   about the above scheeme. If your   time will permit I would ask you for   an answer, and oblige. I remain your  brother in the Gospel. H. K. Hansen.   Bear River City, Utah.

 Portland Fby. 28th, 1854    Brother Wilford    I write a line to say that we  are all as well as usual, we are about through with  a long and tedious winter, since the 1st of July, we   have had a severe winter, a great quantity of snow  & intensly cold weather, mercury frequently 20 below  & some times 30 & upwards. I have not heard from you  for a number of months, presume the deep snows in  the mountains has prevented the mail from crossing    We feel very anxious to hear from you all, how you  are getting along, how your stock of provisions are &c.  are you not thinking of comeing to the states the next  season? we should like very much to see you here.    Father comes to Portland occasionally, he is  quite smart, thinks of going to Limerick soon.    Ms. Scamman has been very ill for some  few months since the returned, they did  not expect her to live for some time, she  suffurd very much, is better now, though weak  and very much reduced. Albert, (Ezra) is home  seems well contented, grows finely & learns well.    I suppose we shall never have the pleasure  of seeing Ms. W. home, & it is quite uncertain if we  ever meet again upon the earth. I hope we shall all  meet in heaven where parting is no more known.

Dear Brethren,    Between  2 and 3 o'clock this morning it began to thun-  der and lighten in this City. At 3 o'clock  it commenced to rain, and shortly after  3, the Temple was struck by lightning. The  East Side of the small Octagon under the vane  appears to have been first struck, then the East-  ern face of the octagonal dome, thence cours-  ing down the N.E. rib of the dome on the in-  side, coming out through the cornice under  the dome, thence down the lower Octagon  between the siding and the N.N.E. column, strik-  ing N. along the roof of the square tower  then passing through the tower roof and  after doing so divided making exit,  one part through the E. front of the tower  but the larger part through the N. front

"Quite a chub of a boy." We have seen  many changes, and have passed through may  trying circumstances as the servants and people  of God since that time!

 of the tower. The part which passed out  the E. side made a fracture on the out-  side of the N. centre recess on its N.  side, but the inside is considerably  shattered in the centre of the. E side of  the tower. The outside fracture is about  5 ft long perpendicularly and averaging 6   inches in width. The part which passed  through the N. side of the tower went down  the side of the tower till it reached the  main roof; here it tore the roofing canvas  from the fastenings on the inside of  the main roof parapet, and apparently  went down the roof drain pipe to the  large cistern without doing further  damage.    You will perceive that the damage   is to Dome and Tower, consisting of  woodwork and lash and plaster work.   The main building is all right except  the two upper circular window frames on  the S. side of the tower. These are shattered  and blackened though but one light of 
 glass is fractured.    Herewith please find enclosed Photograph  of the St George Temple which is sent to  aid you in the understanding our descrip-  tion. The red ink marks show the out-  side damage as far as we can.    Shall we repair the damage done  or not? Until we hear from you  we shall use a wagon cover &c to   prevent damage by rain.    We gratefully recognize the providence  of the Almighty in the comparatively  slight damage done, in consideration  of the severity of the shock.    It has not in the least interfered  with our Ordinance work.    With kindest remembrance and  prayers for you and all co-laborers for  Zion.    I remain, as ever,  Yours in the Gospel.  John D. T.

Beloved Brother:  I am reminded through reading the proof of of  matter, which is to appear in a coming number of  the "Millennial Star," treating upon your remarkable  life and labor; that in a few more days you   will have reached your ninetieth birthday. The   saints throughout the world rejoice and thank God  that your life is still preserved, I most heartily  join in their acclamations of joy. Your long  life has been a great blessing to all the Lords people.   Your acquaintance and association with the Prophet  Joseph Smith, and the testimonies you have borne  concerning his teachings, and the revelations the  Lord gave through him have been delivered in  the power and demonstration of the holy spirit, and  have swept away the doubts that have arisen in the   minds of some; bringing the truth of God before them  and assisting them to plant their feet in a firm  and safe place. I have rejoiced in listening to the  testimony you have often borne, concering points  of doctrine, and other matters which some have sought  to wrest or deny, and I am sure that thousands  of others, both old, any young, in the land of Zion

 To the presiding brethirn of the Church.    Excuse me, if in any way, I take up your valuable time  I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day  Saints, and have been, for the last 35 years—Embraced  the Gospel in Norway, Europe—and came here with my family    many 17 years ago. I embraced the Gospel on account of  its true principles and its Godliness. It has taken all  my interest, and I have in my weakness, endeavored to  do what I could for its success. While in my native  land, I labored for a time as a missionary, and after that  besides my proffession (being a machinist by trade) I labored  as a home-missionary and teacher. I divided my means,  and have there and since I came here, endeavored to do  all I could for the spreading of the Truth and the success  of this Gospel, and it is my wish to continue to do so.  I have, since I came into this Church, went through many  trials and tribulations, of which, however, I do not complain  They have brought me to humbleness and experience, which  I hope, will some day be for my own good, I do not  bring these things forward, for the sake of self-conceit, for I do

 not expect any reward in this Life, for what I have done  for the Work of God, but, under my present circumstances  I believe it is necessary, that I should inform you of my  position. I have, since my arrival here, worked at my  trade, but had to give it up, on account of very poor  health. I have for the past 11 years, worked as a book  agent, have sold many publications of this Church and  other good Books. This winter ^and up to the present time^ has been a very hard one  for me, my health has been very poor, and my little  business has come to a stand still for want of means.  I am in debt which is very hard for me, as I want to do  as near right as possible. I hereby take the liberty to  solicit you to be of the kindness to assist me with a  loan of money, that I may be able to pay my pressing  debt, and continue my business, I will refund, as soon  as possible, any amount, that is lent to me, and offer  you my heartfelt gratitude.    Hoping you will excuse thus intruding on your  valuable time and patience. I remain your brother  in the Ever-lasting Gospel.    Paul Christensen.

 Cardston. Aug. 17th 1896.    Presidents. Wilford Woodruff, George Q. Cannon and   Joseph F Smith,    Salt Lake City.    Beloved Leaders of Zion,    There is a subject I feel to lay before you that has occupied  my thought a great deal of late, so much so, that I wrote  the Church Historian, Apostle F. D. Richards, about it, but feel I  should have writen you direct.    It ^is^ concerning some very sacred  objects I once had the honor of calling my own. They are two  Seer Stones, and a flint arrow point. As you know, these choice  relics had once been the property of the Prophet Joseph, and later on,  of my honored fathers. This fact alone tells how I prized  them. Because of their great historical value, and sacred nature,  I was led part with them, and put them where they  properly belonged, into the hands of the President of the Church.    There is a question naturally arises, If they are retained in 
 inform Bro Leithead.  I also think that there is ^no^ need  of useing any more Tithing  towards fixing up the ferry.  The proceeds of the ferry should  certainly be enough to keep every-  thing in repair from this time  on, and leave considerable towards  improving the roads or for some  other good purpose.  Please excuse  me if I am too free in making  suggestions    We have been very busy for  about two months,  Have crossed since the first of August 393  wagons.  I think the rush is  now over for the season    The weather has been very mild and  pleasant during December thus  far.  With kind regards for yourself  and family, thanking you for all  your kindness to me    I remain yours in the Gospel    Warren. M Johnson   
 Copy    Cambridgeport, Mass.,    August 23rd, 1849.    Elder Badlam,    Dear Brother:    We have received two long interesting letters from you, one  from Panama and one after you had been in San Francisco about six days;  also one from Chagress, making three in all. I have written several to  you, which I have sent by private conveyance, in shaips that go around  Cape Horn, and sister Badlam has sent several by steamer; but I have not  seen any she has sent to you, and do not know what she has written, as I  have generally been gone when she has written, and, not knowing how much  church news she has sent you, I feel it to be my duty to fill a sheet to  you and send it by mail, and perhaps I ought to have done it before this.  You have been very diligent in writing to me and your family, and your  letters have been highly interesting. I feel thankful that you have got  along so well and been prospered on your journey and arrived in safety at  San Francisco. I have felt to pray for you continually, from day to  day. Since you left here I have been gone from home most of the time,  and have only remained at home about long enough to answer my correspond-  ing letters, write my journal, and close up such work as seemed necessary  to be done, and then I am off again. I have visited Boston, or even  Cambridgeport, but little since you left, only going and returning from  my journeys. I was much interested in the account you gave me of Pana-  ma and journey from Chagres, also your success on the ship with the pas-  sengers, and the account you gave after you landed.    The New York Herald publishes every week a number of letters from  the gold diggings of San Francisco, but they are very conflicting in thei^r^  statements. I expect dry goods must be very cheap by this time in San  Francisco. In order to do by you as you have done by me, I will go back  to the time you left and give you a ^little^ history of events as they have passed  along with me since we parted. Soon after you left I wrote some lengthy  letters to the Presidency in the Valley, spoke of your course, and the  object of your going to San Francisco, that you went with my counsel to.  We were notified by the keepers of the Boydston Hall that we could have 
 families, as heir-looms, why should they not remain in  the family of Brigham Young? but this answer comes with  great force, has any family a right to retain such important  and clearly, "church property" relics as individual posessions. No  they should be forever retained as church property, "His mouth peice"  being their guardian.    Tell me are my impressions right? "The  right" is my only desire, and in your hands I leave it.    The saints are in excellent health and a  spirit of peace prevails, quite a number of new convert,  and as usual, an excellant crop of "home emigrants."  Good crops, plenty of rain, and nature smiles in her mantle  of green. We are looking forward to ^a^ visit of some of the  brethren for our Sunday School and Quarterly Conferences  with pleasure.    With daily prayers for the blessings of  heaven upon you and yours, and an earnest desire that my  communication will be received in the same spirit I have sought  with prayer to pen it. I am ever your humble and devoted sister   in the gospel, Zina Young Card    see over. 
 In the absence of President Woodruff  I would say that her views were  quite correct on the subject, and   there is now doubt that proper  arrangements will be made  for preserving relics of a sacred  character in the Temple, where  it would seem they could be  most properly cared for.

 To all the Saints in the Eastern States    Greeting    This is to certify that I have recieved late special  instructions from the Presidency of the church who are  located in the valley to gather up all the Saints in the  Eastern States that I possibly can and gather them next  summer to the vally of the great Salt Lake. They want  cotton and woollen manufactorors Iron founders farmers and  machanics of all kinds to come on with-out delay. And I hereby  delegate and apoint Elder Edson Whipple to cooperate with me in  assisting me to carry out the instructions of the presidency in  the gathering of the Saints to Zion from the Eastern States at this  late hour of the day I call upon all the Saints that Elder Whipple  may visit to give heed to his instructions And carry out his  advise and instructions upon the subject of the gathering And the  Blessing of the Lord will rest upon you. Elder Whipple is capable  of instructing and edifying you and of giving you corecct council  upon this subject he has been with me knows my plans in the  gathering and has had the instruction which I have recieved  There will be three companies of Saints leave the Eastern States about  the first of April St Louis. They will start from the three folowing  places Philad N York & Boston all of which will unite together at  St Louis and go to Counsil Bluffs thare prepare our teams and go to the  vally under the organization which belong to the vally camp of  Israel. And now O, all ye Saints of God in any portion of the Eastern  States Both high & Low Both Rich and Poor I call upon you in the nam[e]  of the Lord to go to with all your might And settle up your  business. Pay your [yeaet] debts as far as within you lies And arise  and go out of Babylon and join the company which goes out 
 next spring let evry Latter day Saint who can command  twenty or twenty five dollars each (when their business is closed)  Not tarry behind but go to the west with the Saints as farr  as it will carry you.

 St. George, Utah Apr. 12, 1887    Mrs. Eliza R. Snow Smith,    Beloved Sister, Honored Lady, and Inspired Poetess—    While musing upon my exiled lonely bed last night, my thoughts turned on thee,  and as I cannot visit you in person, I feel disposed to use my pen. I have been  informed that you are in a low state of health and perhaps not likely to recover and  a prospect of your closing your labors here in the flesh, and passing on to your labors  upon the other side of the Veil, I thought if that was the case, I would like to communi-  cate with you before you left. I felt that if there is an immortal spirit dwelling in a morta  mortal body that can lie down in death in sweet repose, it is Sister Eliza. When I  contemplate your life and labors of love to all classes of Latter-day Saints, the inspira-  tion of your pen, which has cheered and encouraged Patriarchs, Prophets and Apostles and  Saints in the deepest hours of their afflictions, sorrows, persecutions and death, and  the army of innocent children, the seed of Joseph, whose minds you have guided into paths  of virtue, truth, and holiness, in the organizations of the Primaries and labor in the  Sabbath Schools, Mutual Improvement Assoc., also your labors in the Relief Societies and   in the Assemblies of the Saints, and your ominous labor in Holy Places for the dead.  And that you have passed through all the afflictions, tribulations, and persecution with  the Saints and have dwelt in the flesh almost three generations, as man counts time, I  say when I reflect upon these things, I feel that you, sister Eliza, an elect Lady of the  Lord, can lay down your mortal body when the time comes without a sting, a pang or a regret  and pass on to your work on the other side of the Veil to a far higher state of glory  where you will find a host of Patriarchs, Prophets, Apostles and Saints, as well as a large  army of children who await your coming and will greet you with joy and rejoicing. I can  say of a truth that your eye hath not seen, your ear heard, neither hath it entered into  your heart to conceive the honor and glory that awaiteth you on the other side of the Veil.  Through the blessing of God you have been enabled to create a name and fame that will never  be forgotten through all time and eternity. Truly you will go down to the grave like a shock  of corn fully ripe. When your spirit leaves your body you will find a host of friends to  greet you who await your coming. I hope when I have finisehed my work I may be found worthy  to meet with the same company that will greet you with joy. I feel that you can contemplate  your change from mortality to immortality with rejoicing. Should you meet with that company o[f]  lo[y]al friends, that Heavenly throng before I do, I have ab a boon to ask of you, that you  will give my kind love to Joseph, Hyrum, Brigham, Heber, Willard, George and the hosts of  brethren you will meet as well as those loyal sisters Mary Ann, Vilate, Phoebe, Margaret and t  to the army of those faithful daughters of the Lord with whom we have both associated here  on earth. As to myself, I have just passed my fourscore years, I am still in very good  health, and as circumstances still deprive me of speaking in public to the living, I am  trying to labor what I can for the dead. I met on the 2nd of March 125 friends in the  Temple of the Lord, 73 of which got endowments for my dead. I addressed them for a short  time. I was sealed while there for 73 couple[s] of dead which makes about 3000 of my dead  which I have done endowments and sealings for and which leaves me about 265 more to work  for before I finish my record which I am in hopes to live to accomplish. I have had a  great anxiety for the redemption of my dead while I dwell in the flesh. I met you in the  Social Hall at the reception on your 80th birthday but I do not recall your present age.  I do not wish to weary you with a lengthy communication, neither do I wish to trouble you  with writing to me not knowing the state of you[r] health, but should your brother Lorenzo  be with you or any friend who could send me a few lines to let me know your state of health,  it would be a consolation to me. I pray God to bless you with joy and peace during your  remaining days and hours and when your hour of departure comes that you may die in the Lord  and sleep in peace which is my earnest prayer.  Your Brother in the New and Everlasting  Covenant.    (Signed, Wilford Woodruff    Any communication from any of my friends to me give to John Jaques at the Historians'  Office, it will r[e]ach me.

 that room no longer without doubling our rent; so we gave it up and have  held no meeting in Boston since. I opened my own hired house for meet-  ings on Sunday and one evening in the week, which I have kept up to this  day, except part of the time on Sunday at brother Bird's. I had full  houses and I baptized a dozen or so. One was Mr. Snow and wife, a Uni-  versalist, and a keeper of one of the engines; another was Andrew Delin,  from Sweden, a smart man and one that I think will be useful in a future  day, in carrying the Gospel to his own nation. Another was father Ezra  Carter, Mrs. Woodruff's father. He was 78 years old, is smart, walked  to the top of Bunker Hill monument with me. He is strong in the faith.  I was truly glad to baptize him, as he has been believing for seven years  Mrs. Woodruff feels that it amply pays her for coming to this country.  Elder Whipple, one of the pioneers forom the Salt Lake Valley, spent sev-  eral days with me, and brought several of his relatives out to meeting.  Father Carter spent about one month with me. Calvin I. Foss, son of  sister Sarah B. Foss, also called upon me, and wished me to assist him  in getting into a good company to go to the gold diggings; so after  looking around, I got him into the Massachusetts Bay Store, Mining and  Trading Company. He left for San Francisco on the ship Acrates, on the  5th of April. I sent letters and papers to you by him. He wrote from  Rio Janeiro, was getting along well. I expect he will call upon you.  Nathaniel Holmes, of Bradford, died on the 20th of February, a Srtrangite.  I left home early in the spring for the west, visited New Haven, New York,  Philadelphia, and many other places. I assisted brother W. I. Appleby  to start off for the Bluffs from Philadelphia, with a company of 80 Saint^s^  50 from the Philadelphia Branch. He arrived at St. Louis all safe with  all his family; baptized four of his family, three sons and one daughter,  the day before he started. But when he arrived in St. Louis, the cholear^a^  was raging in all its horrors, from New Orleans to Galena, and up the  Missour^i^ River, and all over that state, slaying its thousands. Every  steamer on all those rivers was pickled with the cholora, and officers,  crews, and passengers were dying by scores. He went on board of the  steamer Monroe, bound for St. Joseph's, with a company of soldiers or godl^d^  diggers, bound for California, and the cholera was on board when he went   on to it. About a hundred Saints went on with brother Appleby. By the 
 Mrs Emma S. Woodruff 
 time they had arrived at Jefferson City, all the gold diggers, 35, were  dead but two; also the captain, mates, two clerks, one engineer, pilot,  barkeeper, twelve boat hands, and fifteen of the Saints, including child-  ren. The names of the Saints, as far as I can recollect, are as follows:  From Philadelphia, Adams (tobacconist), his wife and two daughters, bro.  Hand, Bro. Lamb, sister Hampton and part of family, sister Brown. From  St. Louis, old mother Bokley, Sabra Granger and Lavina Hodges. When the  boat landed, all the crew that was left, with the passengers, fled int^o^  the city. It was reported in several letters that Elder Appleby was  dead, but it was false. He slipped on board of another boat, and arriv-  ed at the Bluffs with his family and the rest of the company, all well,  and is now on his way to the valley, with a company. I sent all of my  letters and papers on by him.    The cholera has been very fatal at St. Louis. They have had from  one to two hundred deaths in that city daily by cholera, in a population  of 50,000. There has been some 5000 deaths by cholera in that city in  five weeks. It has swept all through Missouri; very fatal at Indepen-  dence. It is said that 35,000 gold seekers, bound for San Francisco,  have gone on to the plains to take the overland route via South Pass of  the Rocky Mountains. They made their rendezvous at Independence, St.  Joseph, Ford Kearney and Kanesville. The greatest number was at Inde-  pendence. The papers say that the cholera was so bad in that town that  the gold diggers all left in a fright, and did not stop to bury their  dead, but piled them up in their winding sheets by the way side in heaps  of five and six together, and the road was strewn with the dead, until it  was awful and horrible in the extreme to behold; so say those who wit-  nessed it. These companies had over 60,000 head of cattle and horses,  and if the history of those companies does not tell a tale for the re-  corder before they reach the gold diggings, then I am mistaken. Thous-  ands of their cattle died before they got to the Black Hills, and many  men, and some thousands, are returning back. Cholera has been fatal at  Alton, Quincy, Carthage, and many parts of Ill. About 5,000 deaths at  Cincinnati by it; about 50 deaths daily in Philadelphia and New York. It  has ranged in Boston from 10 to 78 deaths daily, 78 being the highest  number. It is still all around us, but on the decrease. It has been

In that letter I asked him  to write & tell me what He wanted to build what  kind of a House & at what cost I have asked in  my Letter to you if He received that Letter I have  not received any Answer from any one I told  him in that Letter I would give him to begin  with $200 in cash to help buy material, and I  would get the Church to do the carpenters work  if I could and I would do what Els I could  you want me tell Deferente what I could do  for him that is sumthing I cannot do for  I do not know what that Bill will do if that  Bill will permit probablly can get him $400  in cash But I think you have had acquired  Enough with me to know that I do not promise  Wife children or friends to perform Earnstly &  cannot do I would rather do more than I  promise then to promise more than I can do  I want to know if Asahel got my Letter 
 very fatal on the southern plantations; one man, out of forty blacks,  lost thirty-nine. Many noted men have fallen this summer by the cholera,  among whom are President Polk, General Gains, Worth, Col. Harding, Mrs.  Madison. President Taylor has been attacked, but got better. The chol^-^  era is also raging at the present time, through England, Paris, and most  of Europe. Many deaths are on most of the emigrant ships now landing at  New York. There has been but few deaths among the Saints, considering  the many who have been among it. Capt. Jones and Spencer left Liverpool  in February with a fleet of six ships, with about 1500 Saints. All land^-^  ed safe at New Orleans, and went from there to Council Bluffs in the  midst of the worst time of the cholera. There was about fifty deaths  out of the whole number, mostly on the Missouri River. Jones and Spen-  cer are on their way to the valley. I do not know what success the  Saints will have this season in crossing the mountains, as I should not  think there would be grass enough through the Black Hills for the animals  of the gold diggers alone to stand three tier deep upon. George A.  Smith and E. T. Benson have gone with companies to the valley. Elder  Hyde is left at the Bluffs, still printing the papers and counselling the  people. The Sa[i]nts at Pottawatomie Co. have escaped the cholera this  season, while it has been all around them. Sanducky City, Ohio, had a  population of 4,000, was entirely depopulated with the cholera, until   there was not 400 left; every doctor, lawyer and priest in the place,  with most of the population, died. There was none to attend to the sick  or bury the dead, and the last account, many remained in their houses un-  buried. There have been many calamities taking place in the States  since you left. A mob of some 20,000 gathered at the Astor Place The-  atre, broke in the doors and windows, was fired upon by the military, 25   killed, 50 wounded. Large mobs in Philadelphia once a month, more or  less killed. More than one half of the business part of the City of St.  Louis, Mo, is laid in ashes. It burned 600 ^six^ hundred stores and dwellings,  all the insurance offices, five banking houses, telegraph office, 25  steam boats, and a loss of six million ($6,000,000) dollars. They have  had another fire since; several steam boats and dwellings burned; a mob  raised; some lives lost; the cholera followed the fire, and laid its  thousands in the grave. The Levee at New Orleans has been under water 
 in the House what does that mean and none of the  family capable of getting 10 cts worth of Good pens they  are cheap. Now concerning the fish Hooks I will  say I cant Blame my self for getting fish hooks in my  finger but for travelling though such an immens  thicket of Brush, I think you or most any Els have  gone through that thicket & carried a fish line with  a hook on it you would have got a hook in all  yor fingers it was the worst body of Brush I  Ever attempted to to go through. We will let the hooks  go my fingers have got well. Now concerning coming  South I had talked with Brother Thompson and  me had made up our Mind as follows for   you to Leave S. L. City July 28 friday^Thursday^, spend friday ^Thursday^ night  in provo Sunday Morning ^Friday Afternoon^ take cars & be at Milford  Sunday ^Saturday^ Morning Brother Thompson will take you  in a waggon in the Morning & bring you to Ceder on  Monday ^Sunday^ bring you to Belview & Tuesday ^Monday^ Aug 2 come   to St George.  The reason Brother Thompson  has to take his time off the week He has to be  at the temple Wednesday morning and we want  it to be so arranged that when He goes back it  will be after the close of the Temple at 12 Aug  so He will be at Liberty to go back with you  to Milford when you get ready. Now do you  understand. Now work to that point as Near as   your ^can^ it will be in the middle of the Hotest weather  My Love to all the family As Ever your  L. Allen 
 if He did I want him to answer me and if He  did not then thare is sumthing wrong with the  Mail I can do as much again if the Church  business can go on as I can if it is stoped  I dont want Asahel to look upon the gloomy  side of the question but be hopeful I will do  what I can for him.

 St George Temple Feb 19, 1878  Elder Erastus Snow  Salt Lake City    Dear Brother    I receved your  Welcome letter of Feb 14, and was glad  to lear[n] from you Our work in  the Temple continues mostly up to its  full capacity. On the 12 we baptzed  1582 & on the 5, 1119.  We have had  214 & 226 endowents in a day and the  interest continues on the increase John  W Young has been here near two  weeks I spent Mondy the 11th with him  and a few others rolling down rock &  making a wall on the south side of the  Dug way near Middleton and then  worked at yesterday to finish it up  so teams could not run off there  Dug was North of Washington should  be sent in the same manner I   expect he will start for Salt Lake some  day this week It is a general time of 
 Stanly Buildings Bath Street  Liverpool Jan 30 ^3rd^ 1846    Dear Brother in the Kingdom of God    I once more call upon Uncle  Ozem to read a few words from me of but a few as the  ship is about starting. I have though[t] much of  Uncle Ozem  of late And to cut a long story short I am going to   Nauvoo & there to Cala. I want to take my kindred  with me, as may as will go. My family leaves Liverpool  for Nauvoo via New Orleans the 10 Jan. I leave for New York  the 16th I shall ^call^ upon father Woodruff in Farmington as I   go along. I wish to see you then I think of taking father  & Mother to the west with me & one of the greatest  wishes of my heart is that Unclese Ozem maybe in   our camp & go with us to esstablish a colony I dont  know how Aunt Hannah & your family would feel about  going with us if you or any of our friends that in the  church wish to go with me I will Rendar them any  assistance in my power I will with pleasure give my  Respects to your family should you feel  disposed to go along you will do well to make  any preperations that you can before I can &  the Rest afterwards I shall want to start for  Conneticut the lart of everMarch.

 broke away this spring, and New Orleans has been under water more than a  month, and the loss of property been immense. Watertown, New York, is  burned up. Also $60,000 worth of Milwa^u^kie is also burned, and large  fires in almost every town; many fires in Cambridgeport since you left.  I have just returned from a mission of two months in New Brunswick, Mir-  amichi, Prince Edward's Island, Nova Scotia, &c., and I have seen two  hundred miles square of those provinces either burned over this spring or  burning while I was there. Such fires were never known in that country.  No rain in that country from April to August, and the fires got into the  forest, and burned hundreds of miles over, sweeping fences, dwellings,  barns, mill^s^, lumber yards, towns, cities, &c., all before it, in some in-  stances driving the entire population on to the beach or into the sea. It  seems as though nearly the whole country was ruined, and the fires not  bringing trouble enough, the people have risen in mobs, burned the Par-  liament houses, and government property, stoned and egged the Governor,  and the people seem bent on burning up everything that is left, and kill-  ing each other. The day before I got to St. John's a company of Orange  men were marching in procession, were stoned by the Catholics, a fight  ensued; about twenty were killed and twice that number wounded. They  fought with stones, clubs, rifles, muskets, &c. I was on the ground on  the occasion, and the doors and windows were riddled with bullets and  slugs. The people were much excited the day I was there. I found the  whole country through which I travelled in a horrid state; the people in   a state of starvation. No business going on; all trying to go to the  states for better. The people were leaving with their packs on their  backs. I had a hard journey through that country; was sick part of the  time. I spent one week very pleasantly with Capt. Joseph Russell, of  Miramichi. He owns the whole Island he is on; has expended some $30,00^0^  in buildings; says he will sell the whole at auction on the 5th of Sep-  tember if he does not get ^£^50 for it. He has three new ships not sold,  about 700 tons each, which he will sell in Liverpool market; will go  from Council Bluffs to the valley one year from next spring. He sent up  to brother Hyde of late ^£^330 to help meet those merchant debts. His son,  who held the office of a Priest in the Church, died of late with the con-  sumption, strong in the faith. He has now but two sons living. I

Bleak for that man as He is far  better acquainted with the business and  already has it in [cha[r]ge] Brother Mc-  Allister is anxiously awaiting for an  Answer about the Municipal Election  of this City early in March I wish  to stop here untill the conference on  the 16 of March Among other things  I am trying to get all my Endow[men]ts   work that I have had Done recorded  in my family record while I can  preside over it. We have got our holes  dug mostly thr[ou]gh the Temple Block for the  trees and black Earth drawn to set them  but the trees have not come from Kanab  as snow is on the ground there we are  setting out what trees we can get here  I am sending to H S Eldridg for a 40 gallon  cask of pure olive oil and I hope they  will not send us Lard oil as they

Your family  are all are all well here as far as I can  learn I have not had much time  to visit any where since I came  here as I spend nearly all my time  in the Temple The people are begin[in]g to  garden we have had counsiderable  pains of Late at Hard Cold. Storm to  day I have been watching your  Legislature labor with much interest  but could not see or hear of the  Gaovnor signing many of your  Bills Neither do I learn that He  has vetoed many I hope you may 
 baptized one of them; the other will be baptized by his father, who is  an Elder and presiding over a small branch of the Church, and has a chap-  el in his own house. Brother Russell went with me to Prince Edward's  Island. We called upon William and John Maxfield; both have large  farms, but cannot sell them for anything. John Maxfield's mills have  shared the fate of others in that country, been burned to the ground by  the sweeping fires; they saved their dwellings. Property in the prov-  inces will hardly bring cash at any price at the present time, and pros-  pect of it being worse. I ordained William Maxfield an Elder, and ap-  pointed him to preside over the branch there, of 32 members. There are  but four members left in Charlottetown. I sent word to brother and sis-  ter Foss not to depend upon the fifty dollars left ba^y^ Giddle, until you  returned, for I did not think your family ought to be troubled with it  while you were gone. I did not find but few Saints in that country.  Brother Russell made particular enquiry about your welfare. Sister Bad-  lam may have named to you, in her last letter, that sister Bride died of  late at St. Louis, of cholera. Sister Sayers was with sister ^Sabra^ Granger  when she died. Sister Sayers is well and gone to the valley.    I had an interview, while at New York, with Elder Thomas Brown, from  Liverpool. He paid the fare of 42 families to the Bluffs, and one lady  of Wales paid the fare of 70 families, who went with Capt. Jones. Bro.  Brown sent up 10,000 dollars worth of goods to the Bluffs. When he left  they were baptizing about 1,000 per month in that land. There has been  some terrible ship wrecks on the Atlantic this season. Two ships de-  stroyed by icebergs; 60 froze to death in one night on the ice. Anoth-  er vessel about 200 lives lost. The last trip of the Europa had a col-  lission with a Boston ship loaded with emigrants; the ship sank in four  minutes, 134 lost, 50 killed in the concussion. Many steamboat disas-  ters, and many lives lost on the lakes and rivers, and many railroad dis-  asters. You recollect Sidney Roberts writing a letter to you. He  palmed himself off on the churches as being sent to collect money for the  poor. He collected several hundred dollars, got $70 out of the small  branch in Fair Haven, Ct. Quite a number have been baptized through the  various branches in this country this season. Little and Hardy are  still carrying on their merchandize, but all branches of business are 
 Great Salt Lake City July 31st 1856    Brother Thompson    Dear Sir    As the eastern Mail is about  leaving I improve it by writing a few lines I   wrote you the last Mail but suppose you   have not time to answer my object in writing  at this time is to Request you to forward   me some more grafts for me to set next  Spring. I wrote in season so that you may have  time we have already some good fruit for the   States & Calafornia bought by spring was grafted   & are growing finely but I have none of them yet, then  you have many kinds which we have not got in   this vally. I wish you would cut me some of   your best grafts as you did before Number & name   them so I can get the accoumt of them & if you would   give me a short description of them I would like it I   wish you would put them into a round tin tox fill   it full of grafts then sodden it up air tight &   I think I will get them safe write my Name on   the tin W.

 Norwalk Connecticut Oct 17th 1848    My Dear Phebe    Inasmuch as I cannot hear from you  nor my poor little suffering Pilgrims I feel that I ought to write the  oftener to you, I begin to feel a little Homesick and that you know is a strange  thing for me when I am traveling so much, but I suppose it is becaus I  want to see you, I feel anxious to get home once more but it seems  as though I could not travel ownly about so fast unless I here  things undone that ought to be done I am trying to visit as  many of the Branches on my return as I can find on my way  so as to organized those which are unorganized & leave them in  as good state as I can (anonymous not from R is anonymous your pls say you)  I went to long Island on Saturday Held a meeting on Sunday  with them returned to New York on Monday, visited Mrs. Sloan  & Calvin found them well as usual, visited the Saints. saw  Sister Shelden she sent her best respects to you I saw  Br Holister He made ^me^ a present of 20 shares of stock in the  New Jersey mining Company. the Branch is in good order  at the present time in New York I took boat at N.Y.  & arrived here last Evening their is a Branch of the Church  in this place in a scattered conditions the presiding Elder  is 10 miles from this place I cannot get a meeting untill  to morrow night so I shall attend to it I am right  upon the sea shore whare the got boat loads of round & soft  clams, scallops oysters fish &. I had scollops clams & oysters  fer supper last night, & they were fine the baths though the 
 dull. Brother Barnes lost his youngest child of late. Brother Cannon  has had a good run of business this season; has moved to Cambridgeport  near me. Brother Bird has been dangerously sick for few days, is now  getting about again.    The wars of Europe are still raging with great fury. The French  troops have finally entered Rome. The Hungarian armies are defeating  the united armies of Russia and Austria. Fifty-two thousand Jews are  now fighting with the Hungarians, against the Russians. The Jews have  now Rabbis in America collecting money to lay the foundation of their  temple in Jerusalem. The signs of the times are big with events at the  present day. As concerning your family since you have been gone, I will  say I think they have got along very well, as far as I know; they have  mostly had good health. Alexander was attacked very suddenly with vom-  iting and other sickness. I administered to him by anointing of oil,  laying on of hands and prayer. He was well next day. I dont know of  any other sickness in the family. I have been gone from home so much,  I have not been able to call upon them as much as I would like to. When-  ever I have had an opportunity I have enquired into their circumstances.  I do not think they have had an opportunity of selling but very little  varnish since you went away. I told sister Badlam to let me know her  wants, and I would divide with her. My means has been very limited this  season. I have had as much as I could do to meet my rent, get bread for  my family, and pay my travelling bills. She has never called upon me  for means, only in two or three instances, and then for a little change.  I have always given double the amount called for, and the whole of it put  together would hardly have bought a breakfast at San Francisco. A few  days since she called for twenty five cents, and Mrs. Woodruff gave her  fifty cents, and I gave her $5.00. I wish it had been a hundred, for  I have no doubt that they needed it, but he that has not got cannot give.  Mary had a [blank] little party last evening, and Rhoda and Phebe Foss,  Mrs. Woodruff's nieces, who are at our house, attended, as Mary was going  away on a visit for a while down to Cohasset. Mr. Mc.Clare has conveyed  an idea to me that he intended to assist your family while you were gone,  but do not expect that he has done much yet, except perhaps attending to  some bill or two which was due. Mr. McClane and family have resided in

Father Carter and family are well). Mrs. Woodruff  wishes to be remembered to you. She says she remembers the promise she  made you when you left, and often remembers you, and believes you will  prosper, and return in safety to your family. She says she often sees  sister Badlam, says she keeps up good courage, and gets along well. I  have lately seen the Epistle of the Presidency, which gives an account of  all affairs in the valley, the expected location of some of the Twelve,  &c. I see, from late accounts, that there is much trouble with the In-  dians in Texas, Florida, Arkansaw, and the western tribes. The gold  companies in the western plains have had several fights with the Pawnees  and Sioux, and some killed on both sides.    But I must draw to a close.

 OFFICE OF  The First Presidency  of the  Church of Jesus Christ  of   Latter-day Saints.    P. O. Box B.    Salt Lake City, Utah, June 4, 1897.    Sisters Zina D. Young,  Jane S. Richards,  Bathsheba W. Smith,    City.    Dear Sisters:    The labors which devolve upon Sister Zina in the Temple  and those connected with the presidency of the Relief Society, prompt  us, in consideration of her advanced age, to suggest that she should  have some active help in answering correspondence she receives from  the various branch societies throughout the Church. Sister Zina Y.  Card is visiting here for the present, and we think she would be very  suitable to act as her mother's private secretary to attend to her  correspondence and other labors connected therewith, that you, and all  of you, may be relieved as far as possible from these duties that are  so onerous upon you at your time of life.    Trusting that this suggestion of ours, whiCch is made  solely in the interest of the Relief Society and to benefit each and  all of you, will be received in the spirit in which it is offered, and  praying the Lord to bless you in all your labors, and to preserve your  lives, we remain, with kindest regards,    Your Brethren,    Wilford Woodruff  Geo. Q. Cannon  Jos. F. Smith 
 President Woodruff, who was  present at the conference where the   discourse in question was delivered  and who then endorsed Brother   Smith's statements; was asked the   following question:    "Did you understand Brother Smith  to have any reference to political  matters in his remarks at Provo?"    "Not at all. I understood him to   mean, just as he has now explained.   At the same time I look at the subject  just as Brother Smith does in regard to   leading men of the Church being so  taken up with political matters that   they cannot find time attend to the   duties of their religious callings. I  don't think it would be right.  As to dictating to men with  regard to their political political opinions  or party connections, we don't do any-  thing of the kind. We don't want to  do that, we don't intend to do it, and  if we did want to I don't think it  would be any use. To tell you the  truth I am about tired of myself and  my brethren being accused of inter-  fering with the political concerns of  the people I have frequently stated  my position on the subject as plainly   as I can tell it in words, and if people  insist in pretending not to understand  me, I cannot help it. My actions speak  as plainly as my words. That is  all I care about saying on the subject." 
 to remember you when I go before the Lord. I also wish an interest in  your prayers. I have never seen a time in my day when there has been  such a flood of prophecy and revelation fulfilling as at the present time.  I hope and trust we may live in such a manner as to be prepared for the  events which are rolling like a flood upon the earth, and are startling  to the nations in very deed. I pray that this sheet may reach you in  safety. And that the God of [illegible] Israel will prosper you in your  laudable undertaking, keep you from all harm and danger, return you in  safety to the bosom of your family, is the prayer of your brother and  friend in the kingdom of God,    Wilford Woodruff. 
 At 12:30 ELDER W. WOODRUFF  stood on the upper step of the font  and called the attention of the peo-  ple and said—    "We are this day blessed with a  privilege that but few since the  days of Adam have ever enjoyed.  But few of the sons of Adam have  ever entered into a Temple, built  by the commandment of God, in  which to administer ordinances,  both for the living and the dead.  We have now assembled to dedicate  portions of this Temple unto God,  and I have a request to make of all  the Saints who are present, and I  suppose all who are here profess to  be Saints, for none others should  be here. I realize that this assem-  bly cannot bow the knee in their  crowded condition, but they can  bow their heads and their hearts  unto God. This I want you to do  this day, and those who offer up  prayers in the dedication of this  Temple I want their words repeat-  ed in secret by this assembly before  the Lord, that our prayers may  ascend unto the Ears of the Lord  of Sabbaoth, that they may be   answered upon our heads."    Dedication Prayer offered by Elder  Wilford Woodruff at the St.  George Temple, Jan. 1, 1877.    "Oh God, our Heavenly Father,   Father of Abraham, Isaac, and  Jacob; thou who hast created the  heavens, the earth, the seas, and  the fountains of water, and all  things that dwell therein; accept of  the gratitude of our hearts and the  thanksgiving of thy people that  thou hast preserved our lives to  again enter into another Temple,  which has been built by thy Saints  in these valleys of the mountains,  in which to organize the Holy  Priesthood and to administer the  ordinances of the Gospel of the Son  of God, both for the living and the  dead. Oh, our God, we thy sons  and daughters have assembled to-  gether, in the name of thy Son  Jesus Christ, within the walls of  this Temple, this day, for the pur-  pose of dedicating and consecrating  a portion of this house unto the  Lord our God, that it may be holy  and acceptable in thy sight. May  the prayers of thy people ascend  into thine ears, Oh Lord, and be  heard and answered upon their  heads. We now dedicate this Tem-  ple Block, the land, the water tank,  the fencing and all appertaining  thereto, that it may be holy in thy  sight. We dedicate and consecrate  the foundation upon which this  Temple stands, that it may be holy  unto the Lord our God. This  foundation has been created  through much labor and diligence  of thy servants, and we pray, Oh  God, that thy blessing may rest  upon it, that it may remain as firm  as the foundation of the everlasting  hills, that it may not be moved to  the injury of this Temple which is  built thereon. We dedicate all the  outer walls of this Temple unto thy  name, O Lord, that they may be  holy, and all the materials of which  they are composed—the rock, the  mortar, the sand, the lime, the  plastering inside and out, and every  material that is used in their con-  struction, that they may be sancti-  fied unto the Lord. We dedicate all  the windows belonging to this base-  men story, the sills, the frames,  the sash, the glass, the putty, the  weights, the cords, the fastenings,  and all the materials of which they  are composed, that they may be  holy unto the Lord. We dedicate  all the outer steps and stairways  leading to the Temple, with the  railing, stone, wood, iron, lead and  all materials of which they are  composed. We dedicate unto the  Lord all the inner walls of this  Temple, with all the materials of  which they are composed, that they  may be holy unto the Lord our  God. We dedicate all the doors of  the basement unto the Lord, with  the frames, butts, screws, locks,  and all fastenings, that they may  be holy. We dedicate unto thy  most holy name the font which thy  people have erected for the ordi-  nance of baptism for the living  and the dead. We dedicate the  flagging, the foundation on which  the font stands, unto the Lord. We  dedicate the twelve oxen that bear  up the font, that they may be holy.  We dedicate the font itself, with  the steps leading to it, and the rail-  ing and all materials of which they  are composed, the castings, the  iron, stone, or wood, and we pray  that they may be acceptable unto  thee, O Lord our God. We dedi-  cate the boiler, the engine, and the  pipes leading to the font and wash-  ing baths to warm the water, that they  may be holy. We dedicate  the baths for the washing of thy  people unto thee, O Lord, that they  may be holy. We dedicate the rail-  ing which surrounds the font unto  thee. We dedicate unto thee, O  Lord our God, the rooms which will  be used by thy people for the giv-  ing of endowments and the admin-  istration of the ordinances of thine  house, and all other rooms, includ-  ing the water tank belonging to  the basement story of this Temple  of the Lord our God. We dedicate  all the materials of which these  rooms are composed, the timbers,  joists, flooring, and nails, that they  may be holy unto the Lord. We  dedicate all the frame petitions,  with the curtains and doors thereof,  that they may be acceptable unto   the Lord. We dedicate all the car-  peting which is laid upon the  floors unto the Lord, that the  labor of the mothers and daugh-  ters of Zion maybe accept-  able in the sight of heaven. We  dedicate all the altars, with their  coverings and trimmings, unto the  Lord, praying that they may be  acceptable unto thee. We dedicate  unto the Lord all the chairs,  benches, and all materials which  shall be used in the seating of thy  people in the rooms of this house.  We dedicate unto the Lord all the  furniture made use of in the lower  rooms of this house, the desks,   stands, stoves, pipes, wood boxes,  and all materials thereof, that they   may be holy. We dedicate all the  pillars, and beams resting upon the  pillars, erected in the lower rooms  of this Temple for the support of the  upper rooms that they may be   holy unto the Lord. We dedicate  all the stairways leading from the  basement to the upper rooms, with   the stairs and railing and all mate-  rials made us of construc-  tion, that they may be holy; and  we dedicate all the whitewashing  and painting and plastering, inside  and out, and any material not here-  tofore mentioned in the construc-  tion of the Temple, that it may be  holy unto the Lord our God. And  we ask thee, our Father in heaven,  in the name of thy son Jesus Christ,  that thou wilt accept of this Tem-  ple at the hands of thy Saints, both  male and female who have built  unto thy holy name, and may no  unclean thing be permitted to enter  therein. Wilt thou bless all thy  servants and handmaidens with  the spirit and power of God, who  shall administer in any of the ordi-  nances of life and salvation within  the walls of this house, and ail thy  people who enter the threshold of  this Temple? May they feel thy pow-  er, and be constrained to acknow-  ledge that the power of God rests  upon it. And we ask, in the name  of Jesus Christ, the son of the liv-  ing God, that the prayers offered up  in the further dedication of other   parts of this house this day, or at  any future time in the dedication  of this house, by those holding the  Apostleship or Holy Priesthood,  that their prayers may enter into   the ears of the Lord of Sabbaoth,  and be answered upon the heads of  thy people. O Lord, be not angry  with thy servants while we con-  tinue our supplications before thee  in this the Temple of our God.  Thou hast said that thou wouldst  take unto thyself them whom  thou wouldst take, and preserve  in life them whom thou  wouldst preserve. Thou hast taken  unto thyself thine aged servant, the  patriarch Joseph Smith and his sons  Joseph, Hyrum, Carlos and   Samuel, and many others of thy  servants, but thou hast raised up  unto thyself thy servant Brigham   Young as a law-giver unto Israel   and leader of thy people. Thou  hast taken unto thyself his coun-  sellors Willard, Jedediah, Heber,  and George A., yet thou hast sus-  tained thy servant Brigham for a  generation, as men count time, by  the right hand of thy power. He  has been with thy people through  all their afflications and persecu-  tions, and led them unto these moun-  tains of Israel, and guided and di-  rected the settlement of thy Saints  and all the affairs of Zion, as inspir-  ed by the power of God in this the  last dispensation and fullness of   times, in the which thou hast said  thou wouldst establish thy king-  dom, to be thrown down no more  forever. Therefore, O Lord our  God, we pray that thou wilt give  thy people faith that we may  claim this blessing of thee, the Lord  of Hosts, that thou wilt lay thy  hand upon thy servant Brigham  unto the renewal of his body and  the healing of all of his infirmities,  and the lengthening out of his days  and years; yea, Lord, may he   live to be behold the inhabitants of  Zion united and enter into the holy  order of God and keep the celestial   law, that they may be justified be-  fore thee. May he live to behold  Zion redeemed, and successfully  fight the devils, visible and invisi-  ble, that make war upon thy Saints.  May he live to behold other tem-  ples built and dedicated unto thy  name and accepted of thee, O Lord  our God. And we pray thee, our  Father in Heaven, in the name of  Jesus Christ, if it can be consistent  with thy will, that thy servant  Brigham my stand in the flesh to  behold the nation which now occu-  pies the land upon which thou,  Lord, hast said the Zion of God  should stand in the latter days, that  nation which shed of the blood of the  Prophets and Saints which cry unto  God day and night for vengeance,  the nation which is making war  against God and his Christ, that  nation whose sins, wickedness, and  abominations are ascending up be-  fore God and the heavenly host,  which causeth all eternity to be  pained and the heavens to weep  like the falling rain; yea, O   Lord, that he may live to see that  nation, if it will not repent,   broken in pieces like a potter's ves-  sel and swept from off the earth as  with the besom of destruction, as  were the Jaredites and Nephites,  that the land of Zion may cease to  groan under the wickedness and  abominations of men. We pray   thee, O God our Heavenly Father  that thou wilt bless all the coun-  sellors to thy servant Brigham.  Bless thy servant John W. Young,  his first counsellor, that he may be  clothed upon with the power of  God, that he may be a polished  shaft in thy quiver in the defense of  Zion and her cause. May he com-  fort the heart of his father and have  the blessings of God and thy people  upon his head. Bless the house-  hold of thy servant Brigham,  his wives and children. May his pos-  terity remain upon the earth in  righteousness until the coming of  the Messiah and through the mil-  lennium. Bless thy servant Dan-  iel H. Wells with the spirit and  power of God, and all his house-  hold. Bless all the counsellors  to thy servant Brigham with their  wives and children and all apper-  taining unto them. Bless, O Lord,   thine Apostles, that the spirit and  power of the apostleship may rest  upon them. Bless their wives and   children with salvation and eter-  nal life, and may all the Apostles  of the Lamb of this last dispensa-  tion and fulness of times realize  their responsibilities before God,  angels and men, and magnify their  calling in that way and manner  that they will be satisfied at the  end of their labor. Bless, O Lord,  thy servant George Q. Cannon, who  is our delegate appointed to repre-  sent us in the Capitol of our na-  tion. Clothe him thy power,  O God, and enable him to do thy  will, that his garments may be  clean of the blood of this nation,  that they may be left without ex-  cuse in the day of thy judgements  upon them. O Lord, bless the Pa-  triarchs whom thou hast appointed  in the land of Zion. May they   have power to bless the people by  inspiration, as did the ancients,  that their blessings may be fulfilled  upon the heads of the Saints. Bless  their families and all appertaining  unto them. We pray thee, O Lord,   to bless the High Priests' quorum  throughout the land of Zion. May  the power of the priesthood rest  upon them that they magnify  their calling and have power to  build up the Zion of God on the  earth. Bless their wives and chil-  dren and all appertaining unto  them. We pray thee, our heav-  enly Father, to bless the quorums  of Seventies, with their presidents.  They are called to be special mes-  sengers to the nations of the earth.  Clothe them with the testimony  of Jesus Christ. We pray thee that  they may bring many souls unto  Christ, and be prepared to assist in  binding the law and sealing the  testimony among the Gentiles in  thine own due time. Bless their  wives and children and all their  households. May the blessings of   God rest upon all the Elders of Is-  rael in all the world, with their  families. O our Father in heaven,  we pray thee to remember in  mercy the Aaronic Priesthood,  with their bishops, priests, teachers and  deacons, who are appointed to be  standing ministers unto the church.  Clothe them with the power of  God, salvation and eternal life,  with their wives and children.   Bless we pray thee, thine aged  servant Edward Hunter, who is  called to preside over the bishop-  ric. Thou hast seen he labors and  thou knowest the integrity of his  heart. Clothe him with thy holy  spirit, fill him with the spirit of  council and consolation to his  brethren, and preserve him in the  flesh as long as he shall desire life,  and when he sleeps may he rest in  peace and the works of righteous-  ness follow him. Bless all the or-  ganizations of thy church and  kingdom throughout the world.  May thy people accomplish the  work unto which they are ordained,  build up the Zion of God and  prepare the earth for the coming  of the Son of Man. Bless the  Female Relief Societies throughout  the land of Zion. May they fully  accomplish the object of their or-  ganization by thy servant Joseph.  May they influence the daughters of  Zion to walk in the paths of virtue,  holiness, righteousness, and truth.  May the blessings of Sarah, Hulda,  Hannah, Anna and Mary, the an-  cient prophetesses and holy women  of old, rest upon them. O God of  Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, we ask  thee, in the name of Jesus Christ  thy Son, that thou wouldst remem-  ber thy covenants which thou hast  made with the whole house of Is-  rael; remember them in all their  abidings in these last days. We  pray thee, in this the Temple of our  God, that thou wilt make bare  thine arm of power in the preserv-  ation and salvation of the small  remnant of the Lamanites that are  left in the land. Deliver them, O  God, from the hand of the Gentiles,  who seek to annihilate them from  off the face of the earth. Inspire  their hearts with thy spirit, to re-  ceive the gospel of the Son of God,  that they may be prepared to build  up Zion and fulfil and covenants  and promises made unto them by  their forefathers who inherited this  land. Remember, O Lord, thy cov-  enant people in the north country.  Hasten the day when they shall  come in remembrance before thee,   when the Prophets shall smite the  rocks and the mountains of ice flow  down before them. May the high-  way speedily be cast up in the  midst of the great deep, that they  may come over dry shod. May the  everlasting hills tremble at their  presence and their enemies become  a prey unto them. May they come  forth unto Zion and bow the knee,  that they may be crowned in Zion  under the hands of Ephraim thy  servants. We also pray thee, O  God, that thou wilt remember in  mercy the sons of Judah, upon  whose heads the blood of Jesus  Christ has rested for eighteen hun-  dred years. They have been  trampled under the feet of the  Gentiles and been made a hiss and  by word in fulfillment of the  words of Moses, their law-giver,   and of Jesus of Nazareth, and we  pray thee, oh thou great Eloheim,  that the past may suffice. Inspire  their hearts to return home to Jeru-  salem, the land of their fathers, and  rebuild their city and Temple, that  they may be prepared for the com-  ing of Shiloh, their King. O hear,  O hear us, Lord, in these our peti-  tions, and answer us from heaven,  thine holy habitation, and we will  ascribe all honor, glory, and thanks-  giving unto God and the Lamb,   both now and forever. Amen, and  Amen." 
 42 Clington L'pool Eng.  Aug 20th 1892    Prest Wilford Woodruff—  Salt Lake City Utah    Dear Brother—I have no  disire to increase your burdens God knows  you have enough to bear, but I have been much  exercised concerning a few points contained in  Bro. Roberts lecture ^which he^ delivered before the Mutual Im-  provement Asson on authority of Priesthood.    I quote a few of eseveral items which have come  to my mind, and in all that I say I desire to give  no offence to my brethren in any particular. I can  not say there is one iota of untruth contained in the  lecture, but in my judgement the lecturer does not ex-  plain, sufficiently, points of vital importance. These ^points^  "are a double signifficance at this period of political  excitement; and ^the^ puting forth "liberal" ideas ^in political matters^ which  have brought our Republic to the verge of desolution,  and will ^yet^ prove an important factors in the ultimate  [ov]erthrow of man made governments, vis perfect freedom  [faded text]ie, debauch, the stronger oppress the weak, the rich grow  [ri]cher the poor grow poorer; the spirit shrink and the body  [en]large its beastly propensities, are distressing to contemplate.    Please give any ideas consideration and send me the  [ad]vice and counsel that is necessary to make ^me^ wise as a

 serpent and harmless as a dove.    I have always bileived that, when, when Christs author  ized servants have it revealed unto them that a certain  man was the individual to preside over the Church—His  church, this might be sustained, but not revoked by His peoples.  I have the privilege of showing to God and man that, I am  in harmony with that revelation and my sign of Cove-  nant is the evidence, which I can produce on the spot,  of my unswerving allegiance to Him. All things are done by  common consent which comes through obedience to the  [Lo]rd.    "Joseph presided over the church by the voice of the  people." Very true. And the people were the church  of Christ because they sustained His prophet, which   is equally true.    "Joseph presided over the church etc." "The people chose  to have it so." "He always filled that station by the voice  of the people." These statements are all true but I think  that, with^out^ further explenation they are calculated to mis-  lead the minds of our children. If it is deemed wisdom  to leave these things as they are as they appear in print, I  am content. Please render me a little assistance to put  the break on with a little mode [more] force.    "Ecclesiastical governments as well as civil derive  their just powers from the consent of the governed." I am in-  clined to think that, there is a destinction between to the ^two^ go[vern-]  ments. God calls and authorizes a man, he gathers the people  and they sustani [sustain] him. Men gather and appoint ^or elect^ their  head. One originates in God, the other in man.

 In comparison God has a fine stepper properly harness  to his ^[illegible]^ to assist the brethen; while man has nothing but  a push cart. True, majorities controle in the world &  they ^the wicked^ will seek to push this doctrine upon us, on purpose  to destroy the church. I know their cunning is not equal to  the wisdom of God, and I pray for strength to stand when  these two powers will, apparently, as nearly lie that the boldest  will tremble in the conflict. A bare majority of the people may  reject the prophets of God and by their votes sustain men more con-  genial to their tastes, but in doing this they cut out the only receiving  office on the line through which revelation can come to them. The mi-  nority who sustain the prophet by their votes, are all that is left of the  church of Christ.    The agency of man consists in his having ^had^ power delegated  to him to select his master. I exercise my will power by being  obedient to the chosen of the Lord. I beleive our youth should be  taught to sustain the authorities of the church irrespective of  of numbers. I fix my eyes upon you; I listen to your counsel,  I try to live to have the same spirit that actuates you. The testimony of  the spirit in me is that your mistakes—should you make any—will be  overruled by God for His glory and the good of His people. I beseech  the Father to give me strength to follow you as you follow Christ our Lord.  Will the time ever come when a majority of those claiming mem-  bership in the church—whatever object they have had in forming the  church—will reject the Presidency and apostles by vote in the general  assembly of the people. I beleive the devil has that little game on foot—  that it, the idea, exists in the hearts of men to day.    I am content to leave things as they are for now I feel better. If I  have hurt your feelings in any wise forgive me. I could not rest until I had  chatted with the presidency.    I strive to do my duty in my weak way. In contrast with the brightness  [o]f the more faithful elders, there is much of the old fogy in me I find.    Love to the brethren. God bless you dear brother  I am yours in Christ.

 Mesa Arizona November the 7th 1897    President Wilford Woodruff. Salt Lake City, Utah    Dear Brother in responce to the call I Rec'd  July 31st for a call ^mission^ to the Southeran States I will say that  under my present financial circumstances I do not think  that I could go and do Justice to my mission or the  Church of Jesus Christ with my mind on a mortgaged  Home and the indebtedness which I have become  some considerably involved in. I do not think that Pres-  ident Stokes fully understood my position when he  sent my name in to headquarters    now while do not wish ^to be^ forgotten in ^the^ missionary  labor my feelings are that ^I^ shoud leave to my wife and  little one a Home free from mortage at least    therefore I ask for an extension of time. I have  neglected writing thinking I might be able to fix  my buisness up but the time is drawing nigh when  I should start    I remain as ever your Brother in  the Gospel, Orlando Merrill    Give him what time he needs to fix  his affairs, and when ready he  can report.

 Great Salt Lake City Jan 6th 1861 Ann Cossett Dear Cousin I Received a letter  Uncle Ozem saying that Betsey did not Receive your letter I went down  to her home the day that I got it & Read it to her & she wished me to  say to you that she believed that she had Received all the Letters you had sent to  her she wished me ^also^ to say that about a year ago she had a fellan on her right thumb  which had been a great afliction to her she had a part of her thumb taken  & it had never fully got well & it was a great task for her to write her  health is rather poorly though she does her work. Her Husband Brother Alvord   is also rather feeble in Health yet He does his work. if you wish to send  any litters to her & will address them to her on the Letter then put them  in an Envellop & address that on the outside to W.

 G. S. L. city May 65 1857    To Bishop Clark or Elder Harrison Severe and all to whom  it may concern.    This is to certify that we have had a representation   of the state of affairs and feelings of some of the Indians with you   and would recommend that watchfulness and care be used and found  as far as principle possible, and if by watching there is a chance   to get those three Indians who stole the horses and still threaten to  kill more into custody, it would be well to do so and have them   brought to this city, and have them confined in the Penetentiary. ^until the Presidency return at least^ we   recommend to have William B. Hardy and Enoch R. Dailey to   spend a portion of their time in watching around among the cattle   and herds to see that the stock are not stollen: and should it  require any more let them be employed as herdsmen and watchmen  and they should go armed, and inasmuch as they devote their   time to this purpose they should have their reward, and all men  should be on the watch at the present time so far as possible.   We wish to avoid any war, fight, or quarrel with the Indians   as far as possible in the absence of the Presidency.    Bishop Hunter has requested that the above named brethren  be employed as herein recommended.    W. Woodruff

 New York March 27th 1846    Dear Brother Little    In great Haste I sit  down to say a few words to you before I leave the   City. I had a long interview with Mr Benson  yesterday and He excedingly desires to do business  with us He says if He does it for nothing. I was  much pleased with my interview with him. He  truly seems to be a Gentleman I think it would  be well to keep upon you terms with him as far  as possible I would like to have [Emepatius cating]  as fast as doors are open either by Sea or land but  I think it might for us to see our way clear  in Chartering Ships & get subscriptions among the  Saints for that purpose before running great risks  I like the spirit manifest by Mr Benson And as  far as you can do business as cheap with him as  others I would prefer to continue business with him  as He apparently manifests much interest in our  welfare. I Hope the Lord will open your way  to get a goodly number out by fall if not before  My respects to Sister Little & all the Saints  with    Yours respectfully    W. Woodruff 
 Br Little please take care of the Last letter  I sent you concerning Mr Benson & not let [him]  see it as He may think Hard of me  I saw a strange document in the Hands of  Mr Benson signed by Elder Brannen  pledging himself in behalf of the Latter  Day Saints to deed to Sister Brannen  one Half of all lands & properties the  Saints should possess in Calafornias &c  Br Miles will tell you about it  you will probably Hear from me in  Nauvoo yours respectfully W Woodruff

 Written in L Snows Letter to Br Bernhisel  April 1st [18]50    Brother Bernhisel    I answered your enquiries about  the withdrawing of our petition I do not know whether  you got the Letter or not as I have heard Nothing from  you since I feel to say a few weeks in this sheet  upon the subject as follows. If on consideration you  think it best to withdraw the petition & the committees  or Territories & all other concerned will permit it & let  it drop then it might be well to do so but if by  withdrawing the petition it would not change the action  of Congress But if they would still go on & pass  Laws concerning a Territorial government for Deseret, it  would be better to let the petition remain then  to withdraw it if it made the matter worse  all these things will have to be left to your own  judgment & circumstances    Yours Truly  W Woodruff.

 true copy of a Letter sent to  Middleton & Riley St Joseph  Mo    Great Salt Lake City, July 28th 1853    Messrs Middleton & Riley    Gentlemen    I write to ask a  favor of you which is this I forwarded by Mr Wm  E. Hornon who went East Last fall cash in U.S. gold  $1552.40/100 to be forwarded to the firm of Sanbon &  Carter of portland Maine with a fair promise from  Mr Hornon that He would attend to the business for  me promptly but those Gentlemen up to the first of m[a]y  had not ^received^ the mony or one word from him in any way  & I feel quite Anxious about it.  Mr Kinkade informed  me that He expeted Mr Hornor here soon with a drove of  Cattle for you, but their has been a report here that  He was not coming on this season, that He was in  your employ &c. I have been acquainted with mMr  Homon for several years but Never before done any business  with him, but I had the most implicil[t] confidence  in him as a man of business, integrity & honour from  the recommends which I got concerning him.    Now Gentlemen if you have any knowledge of this affair  if He has made a deposit of this mony with you or made  any arangements with you to pay it, or has communicated  the matter to you in any way you will do me a great  favor to by giving all the information you possess upon the  subject to me the first opportunity by Mail Also to Sanbon  & Carter of portland Main & if you have no knowledge of the 
 Copy of a letter to Middleton & Riley Oct 30th 1853  Great Salt Lake City Oct 30 [18]53    Messrs Middleton & Riley  Gentlemen    I am under still  under the necessity of troubling you once more with  a communication concerning the money which I forwarded  by Wm E. Hornor Hopeing thereby to obtain some information  upon that subject which will be satisfactory to my mind  I also wish to acknowledge the recept of your Letter  saying that you knew Nothing upon the subject. I Now wish  to say that Mr Harmon Has arived in this city his train  one in the Snows in the Moutains Near this city & one  expected in every day Mr Harmon came into the city for corn  to feed the teams to get them in. I Had but a few moments  with him the following is his story upon the subject. that  while going Down last fall the wolves got to his Saddle Bags  & cut it to pieces & destroyed his Amount Book containing the names  of Sanbon & Carter Portland Maine to whom the money should  be [sent] & when He a[rri]v[e]d in the states He had No Address to  Send the money to & He put the money in the hands of His wife  at St Joseph Mo to keep until he should send would what  [disposition] to make of it. He also said that after you got my  Letter He you sent a Letter to him which reached him I think He  said at Fort Cerny He then writes a Letter immediately to Fort  Corny Mr Riley with an order I think to get the Money  of Mrs Harmon & forward it to Sanbon & Carter portland Maine  this story appeared plausible & set My Mind at rest at first

 Livpool Jan 20th 1846    To the Saints in the British Isles greeting  Beloved BFriends    I deem it my Duty  to address a few lines to you through the medium  of the Star Before I take my Departure from  England to returns to America. The shortness of  time & croud of Business forces me to be brief  in my communication. You have already  been informed that the persecutions & banishment  of the Saints west of the Rocky mountains &  a desire to deliver my own family & friends is the  sole cause of my sudden Departure from  your midst, & I now once more appeal unto  you that you let your prayers assend asscend  up before God Day & night in behalf of your  afflicted Brothren in Zion that the Lord may Delievver  them from that persecution &and oppression that  they have long groaned under. Though the edict  of Banishment is past & they are about to make  a sacrafice of there Homes, Lands Homes & the [goos]

Gentlemen by complying with my request you will confer  a great favor upon me    Yours Respectfully    Wilford Woodruff    True copy of a letter sent to Wm E. Hornor June 28th 1853    Brother Hornor    Dear Sir    I take this matter of addressing you  concerning the money which I forwarded by you to be sent to  Santon & Carter Portland Main amount to $1552 40/100 I have  had Letters from them every Mail since your arrival as [state] as  My & they had not received any money from you or any word  either by Letter or Telegraph Neither have I recieved any word from you 
 goods & endure the fatigues of a journey of some  two thousands miles still these pesecuters are  not satisfyed with this but are striving to  stir up every wicked & ungodly character in their  power to palm off all their Black deeds of  infamy & and crime upon the Saints in order  that all the world far & near may varily  think they are doing Gods service while persecuting  the saints. But the day will come when all  men will get there reward for the Deeds done in  the Body. I hope & trust that the Saints through-  out this land will not be weary in welldoing  but sustain the general cause of Zion & each  other by prayer, Love, charity, faith & all good works  My stay in your midst on this mission has  ben limited to one year But I rejoice much at  the progress, prosperity & prospects of the cause during  this peroiod. It has been a year of much interest  to the church in Britain And my prayer to God  as well as in America And I trust that interest  may continue untill the House of Israel are gathered  out together in a manner that their strength & labours  can be condenced ^consentrated^ as the heart of one man 
 by Letter or otherwise upon the subject all of which  seems vary strange to me Neither can I learn from  any source where you are. Mr Kimball seems confident  that you will be here soon with a drive of cattle for Messrs  Middleton & Riley but a report reached me to day saying that  you was not comeing through this season, so upon that rumor  I write to St Josephs Hopeing that this may reach you if  you are there now Brother Hornor if any thing has delayed your  forwarding the money which I sent to you to Santon & Carter  I hope you will attend to it without delay for any long  Detention of the money will be a great Damage to me  both to my honour & derangement of my business. But  Brother Hornor whiclhe I realize that your standing in  the Church & Kingdom of God as well as your high  position in the minds of all business men who know  you as a man of business, integrity, & honour all forbid  any suspicions in the minds of your friends that you would   make any breach of trust by appropriating the money for any  other purpose ownly for which it was sent. yet a delay in  the matter creates a degree of uneasiness to know what is  is come. I have thought it was in consequese of your  Lamenets as I heard you had froze your feet & came  Nigh looseing your Life which I was sorry to learn. if this  reaches you in St Joseph I hope you will write me  immediately without delay & give me a statement of facts as they  are upon the subject 
 Dedication Prayer offered by Elder  Wilford Woodruff at the St.  George Temple, Jan. 1, 1877.    "Oh God, our Heavenly Father,  Father of Abraham, Isaac, and  Jacob; thou who hast created the  heavens, the earth, the seas, and  the fountains of water, and all  things that dwell therein; accept of  the gratitude of our hearts and the  thanksgiving of thy people that  thou hast preserved our lives to  again enter into another Temple,  which has been built by thy Saints  in these valleys of the mountains,  in which to organize the Holy  Priesthood and to administer the  ordinances of the Gospel of the Son  of God, both for the living and the  dead. Oh, our God, we thy sons  and daughters have assembled to-  gether, in the name of thy Son  Jesus Christ, within the walls of  this Temple, this day, for the pur-  pose of dedicating and consecrating  a portion of this house unto the  Lord our God, that it may be holy  and acceptable in thy sight. May  the prayers of thy people ascend  into thine ears, Oh Lord, and be  heard and answered upon their  heads. We now dedicate this Tem-  ple Block, the land, the watertank,  the fencing and all appertaining  thereto, that it may be holy in thy  sight. We dedicate and consecrate  the foundation, upon which this   Temple stands, that it may be holy  unto the Lord our God. This  foundation has been created   through much labor and diligence  of thy servants, and we pray, Oh  God, that thy blessing may rest  upon it, that it may remain as firm  as the foundation of the everlasting   hills, that it may not be moved to  the injury of this Temple which is  built thereon. We dedicated all the  outer walls of this Temple unto thy  name, O Lord, that they may be  holy, and all the materials of which  they are composed—the rock, the  mortar, the sand, the lime, the  plastering inside and out, and every  material that is used in their con-  struction, that they may be sancti-  fied unto the Lord. We dedicate all  the windows belonging to this base-  ment story, the sills, the frames,    the sash, the glass, the putty, the  weights, the cords, the fastenings,  and all the materials of which they  are composed, that they may be  holy unto the Lord. We dedicate   all the outer steps and stairways  leading to the Temple, with the  railing, stone, wood, iron, lead, and   all materials of which they are  composed. We dedicate unto the  Lord all the inner walls of this  Temple, with all the materials of  which they are composed, that they  may be holy unto the Lord our  God. We dedicate all the doors of  the basement unto the Lord, with  the frames, butts, screws, locks,  and all fastenings, that they may  be holy. We dedicate unto thy  most holy name the font which thy  people have erected for the ordi-  nance of baptism for the living  and the dead. We dedicate the  flagging, the foundation on which   the font stands, unto the Lord. We  dedicate the twelve oxen that bear  up the font, that they may be holy.  We dedicate the font itself, with  the steps leading to it, and the rail-  ing and all materials of which they  are composed, the castings, the   iron, stone, or wood, and we pray  that they may be acceptable unto  thee, O Lord our God. We dedi-  cate the boiler, the engine, and the  pipes leading to the font and wash-  ing baths to warm the water, that  they may be holy. We dedicate   the baths for the washing of thy  people unto thee, O Lord, that they  may be holy. We dedicate the rail-  ing which surrounds the font unto  thee. We dedicate unto thee, O  Lord our God, the rooms which will  be used by thy people for the giv-  ing of endowments and the admin-  istration of the ordinances of thine  house, and all other rooms, includ-  ing the water tank belonging to  the basement story of this Temple  of the Lord our God. We dedicate  all the materials of which these  rooms are composed, the timbers,  joists, flooring, and nails, that they  may be holy unto the Lord. We  dedicate all the frame petitions   with the curtains and doors thereof,  that they may be acceptable unto   the Lord. We dedicate all the car-  peting which is laid upon the   floors unto the Lord, that the  labor of the mothers and daugh-  ters of Zion may be accept-  able in the sight of heaven. We  dedicate all the altars, with their  coverings and trimmings, unto the  Lord, praying that they may be  acceptable unto thee. We dedicate  unto the Lord all the chairs,  benches, and all materials which  shall be used in the seating of thy  people in the rooms of this house.  We dedicate unto the Lord all the  furniture made use of in the lower  rooms of this house, the desks,  stands, stoves, pipes, wood boxes,  and all materials thereof, that they  may be holy. We dedicate all the  pillars, and beams resting upon the  pillars, erected in the lower rooms  of this Temple for the support of the  upper rooms, that they may be  holy unto the Lord. We dedicate   all the stairways leading from the  basement to the upper rooms, with  the stairs and railing and all mate-  rials made use of in their construc-  tion, that they may be holy; and   we dedicate all the whitewashing  and painting and plastering, inside  and out, and any material not here-  tofore mentioned in the construc-  tion of the Temple, that it may be  holy unto the Lord our God. And  we ask thee, our Father in heaven,  in the name of thy son Jesus Christ,  that thou wilt accept of this Tem-  ple at the hands of thy Saints, both  male and female, who have built it  unto thy holy name, and may no  unclean thing be permitted to enter  therein. Wilt thou bless all thy  servants and handmaidens with  the spirit and power of God, who  shall administer in any of the ordi-  nances of life and salvation within  the walls of this house, and all thy  people who enter the threshold of  this Temple? May they feel thy pow-  er, and be constrained to acknow-  ledge that the power of God rests  upon it. And we ask, in the name  of Jesus Christ, the son of the liv-  ing God, that the prayers offered up  in the further dedication of other   parts of this house this day, or at  any future time in the dedication  of this house, by those holding the   Apostleship or Holy Priesthood,  that their prayers may enter into  the ears of the Lord of Sabbaoth,  and be answered upon the heads of  thy people. O Lord, be not angry  with thy servants while we con-  tinue our supplications before thee  in this the Temple of our God.  Thou hast said that thou wouldst  take unto thyself them whom  thou wouldst take, and preserve  in life them whom thou    wouldst preserve. Thou hast taken  unto thyself thine aged servant, the  Patriarch Joseph Smith, and his  sons Joseph, Hyrum, Carlos and  Samuel, and many others of thy  servants, but thou hast raised up  unto thyself thy servant Brigham   Young as a law-giver unto Israel  and a leader of thy people. Thou  has taken unto thyself his coun-  sellors Willard, Jedediah, Heber,  and George A., yet thou has sus-  tained thy servant Brigham for a   generation, as men count time, by  the right hand of thy power. He  has been with thy people through  all their afflictions and persecu-  tions, and led them to these moun-  tains of Israel, and guided and di-  rected the settlement of thy Saints  and all the affairs of Zion, as inspir-  ed by the power of God in this the  last dispensation and fullness of   times, in the which thou hast said  thou wouldst establish thy king-  dom, to be thrown down no more  forever. Therefore, O Lord our   God, we pray that thou wilt give   thy people faith, that we may  claim this blessing of thee, the Lord  of Hosts, that thou wilt lay thy  hand upon thy servant Brigham  unto the renewal of his body and  the healing of all of his infirmities,  and the lengthening out of his days  and years; yea, O Lord, may he  live to behold the inhabitants of  Zion united and enter into the holy  order of God and keep the celestial  law, that they may be justified be-  fore thee. May he live to behold   Zion redeemed, and succcessfully  fight the devils, visible and invisi-  ble, that make war upon thy Saints.  May he live to behold other tem-  ples built and dedicated unto thy  name and accepted of thee, O Lord  our God. And we pray thee, our  Father in Heaven, in the name of  Jesus Christ, if it can be consistent  with thy will, that thy servant  Brigham may stand in the flesh to  behold the nation which now occu-  pies the land upon which thou,  Lord, hast said the Zion of God  should stand in the latter days, that  nation which shed the blood of the   Prophets and Saints which cry unto  God day and night for vengeance,   the nation which is making war  against God and his Christ, that  nation whose sins, wickedness, and   abominations are ascending up be-  fore God and the heavenly host,  which causeth all eternity to be  pained and the heavens to weep  like the falling rain; yea, O  Lord, that he may live to see that  nation, if it will not repent,  broken in pieces like a potter's ves-  sel and swept from off the earth as  with the besom of destruction, as  were the Jaredites and Nephites,  that the land of Zion may cease to  groan under the wickedness and   abominations of men. We pray  thee, O God our Heavenly Father,  that thou wilt bless all the coun-  sellors to thy servant Brigham.   Bless thy servant John W. Young,  his first counsellor, that he may be  clothed upon with the power of  God, that he may be a polished  shaft in thy quiver in the defense of  Zion and her cause. May he com-  fort the heart of his father and have  the blessings of God and thy people  upon his head. Bless the house-  hold of thy servant Brigham, his  wives and children. May his pos-  terity remain upon the earth in  righteousness until the coming of  the Messiah and through the Mil-  lennium. Bless thy servant Dan-  iel H. Wells with the spirit and  power of God, and all his house-  hold. Bless all the counsellors to  thy servant Brigham, with their  wives and children and all apper-  taining unto them. Bless, O Lord,  thine Apostles, that the spirit and  power of the apostleship may rest  upon them. Bless their wives and  children with salvation and eter-  nal life, and may all the Apostles  of the Lamb of this last dispensa-  tion and fullness of times realize  their responsibilities before God,  angels and men, and magnify their   calling in that way and manner  that they will be satisfied at the  end of their labor. Bless, O Lord,  thy servant George Q. Cannon, who  is our Delegate appointed repre-  sent us in the Capitol of our na-  tion. Clothe him with thy power,  O God, and enable him to do thy  will, that his garments may be  clean of the blood of this nation,  that they may be left without ex-  cuse in the day of thy judgments   upon them. O Lord, bless the Pa-  triarchs whom thou hast appointed  in the land of Zion. May they  have power to bless the people by   inspiration, as did the ancients,  that their blessings may be fulfilled   upon the heads of the Saints. Bless  their families and all appertaining  unto them. We pray thee, O Lord,    to bless the High Priests' Quorum  throughout the land of Zion. May  the power of the priesthood rest  upon them, that they may magnify  their calling and have power to  build up the Zion of God on the  earth. Bless their wives and chil-  dren and all appertaining unto   them. We pray thee, our heav-  enly Father, to bless the quorums   of Seventies, with their Presidents.  They are called to be special mes-  sengers to the nations of the earth.   Clothe them with the testimony  of Jesus Christ. We pray thee that  they may bring many souls unto  Christ, and be prepared to assist in  binding the law and sealing the  testimony among the Gentiles in  thine own due time. Bless their  wives and children and all their  households. May the blessings of  God rest upon all the Elders of Is-  rael in all the world, with their  families. O our Father in heaven,  we pray thee to remember in  mercy the Aaronic Priesthood, with  their bishops, priests, teachers and  deacons, who are appointed to be  standing ministers unto the church.   Clothe them with the power of  God, salvation and eternal life,  with their wives and children.   Bless, we pray thee, thine aged  servant Edward Hunter, who is  called to preside over the bishop-  ric. Thou hast seen his labors and   thou knowest the integrity of his  heart. Clothe him with thy holy   spirit, fill him with the spirit of  counsel and consolation to his  brethren, and preserve him in the  flesh as long as he shall desire life,  and when he sleeps may he rest in  peace and the works of righteous-  ness follow him. Bless all the or-  ganizations of thy church and   kingdom throughout the world.   May thy people accomplish the  work unto which they are ordained,  build up the Zion of God and  prepare the earth for the coming  of the Son of Man. Bless the  Female Relief Societies throughout  the land of Zion. May they fully  accomplish the object of their or-  ganization by thy servant Joseph.  May they influence the daughters of  Zion to walk in the paths of virtue,  holiness, righteousness, and truth.  May the blessings of Sarah, Hulda,  Hannah, Anna and Mary, the an-  cient prophetesses and holy women   of old, rest upon them. O God of  Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, we ask  thee, in the name of Jesus Christ  thy son, that thou wouldst remem-  ber thy covenants which thou hast  made with the whole house of Is-  rael; remember them in all their   abidings in these last days. We  pray thee, in this the Temple of our   God, that thou wilt make bare  thine arm of power in the preserv-  ation and salvation of the small  remnant of the Lamanites that are  left in the land. Deliver them, O  God, from the hand of the Gentiles,  who seek to annihilate them from  off the face of the earth. Inspire  their hearts with thy spirit, to re-  ceive the gospel of the Son of God,  that they may be prepared to build  up Zion and fulfil the covenants  and promises made unto them by  their forefathers who inherited this  land. Remember, O Lord, thy cov-  enant people in the north country.  Hasten the day when they shall   come in remembrance before thee,  when the Prophets shall smite the  rocks and the mountains of ice flow  down before them. May the high-  way speedily be cast up in the  midst of the great deep, that they  may come over dry shod. May the   everlasting hills tremble at their  presence and their enemies become  a prey unto them. May they come  forth unto Zion and bow the knee,  that they may be crowned in Zion  under the hands of Ephraim thy  servants. We also pray thee, O  God, that thou wilt remember in  mercy the sons of Judah, upon  whose heads the blood of Jesus  Christ has rested for eighteen hun-  dred years. They have been   trampled under the feet of the  Gentiles and been made a hiss and  by word in fulfillment of the  words of Moses, their law-giver,  and of Jesus of Nazareth, and we  pray thee, oh thou great Eloheim,  that the past may suffice. Inspire  their hearts to return home to Jeru-  salem, the land of their fathers, and  rebuild their city and Temple, that  they may be prepared for the com-  ing of Shiloh, their King. O hear,   O hear us, Lord, in these our peti-  tions, and answer us from heaven,  thine holy habitation, and we will  ascribe all honor, glory, and thanks-  giving unto God and the Lamb,  both now and forever. Amen, and  Amen." 
 in building up & beautifying the land of Zion  untill ^her deserts Blossom as the rose^ ^and^ her cities temples & towers point towards  heaven as a token of the fulfillment of the promises of God  unto Israel in the Last dispensation & fulness of  times. It has been Highly gratifying to me from  the beginning to observe the growing unions of the   Saints thoughout the British Isles & their willingness  to abide by ^the^ council of the presidency of the Church  and sustain every man in his office & calling. it is  upon this principle & the principle of unions that Zion  & Jerrusalem will be built up & be prepared  for the coming of the Messiah you have also  nobley responded to the call to assist in rearing unto   the name of the Lord a Temple as the request will show  Also have liberl liberally attendesd to other appeals   that have been made unto you for which you will  not loose your reward.    Elder Reuben Hedlock is again appointed to the [respected]  station of president over the churches in the British  Isles I have every confidence to believe that you  will uphold & sustain him in his office. He has had  much experience in the Church of Christ & will act for  the general good of the cause you will be Blessed in  following his council And upholding him by your faith prayers & good works 
 all is well in this place we had a hard winter & cold spring  grashoppers have destroyed much wheat & corn in the [unclear]  field & crops will be tight flour is Now $20 per bushel  to the Emmigrints.

Their own  works & labours recommend themselves.    I would Advise that the Saints sustain the Star  & give it as wide a circulations as possible for  it is th[r]ough this medium that you obtain complete  informatation Also use your influence to continue  to circulate all our publications as wrote extensively  for they contain truth & truth is mighty & will prevail  Let not the Saints be discouraged because of the   Tribulations & Sacrifizes they are called to pass through  For though the tongue of slander the press & wicked men  send forth as us upon the wings of the wind a flood of   lies ^falshood^ & Bitterness against the Saints yet they will triumph  at last, & God with Eternal truth will gain a victory  over the Devil with his flood of lies & the Earth will  be redeemed from her fall & Mount Zion will yet  enjoy all those Blessings which have been promised  her through the mouth of all the Holy prophets  who have spoken since the world began 
 Before closing this I would advise the Saints to continue  to keep in view the gathering. I have No doubt  but that there will be doors open for the gathering  of the Saints from this land to meet with there  priests who will settle in Calafornia & by uniting  together in wisdom & going by council much may be  done in the continuation of the Emigration    Before closing this address I feel disposed for the  Benefit of the Saints & gratification of the Saints  to lay before you a correct account of the reciepts  for the Temple Donations to myself in complyance  with the appeal made at the Last conference  Also the situation of the printing ^in which I leave the printing^ department in Liverpool

 FIRST LECTURE:    "Utah from 1847 to 1870."    Of this lecture the Deseret Evening News said: "The  lecture was replete with information on the subject handled  by MR. ELLIS; his logic was irresistable, and his sentences were  at times arrayed in the eloquence of an orator who is  conscious of defending the truth in the midst of opposition.  The lecture should be heard throughout the whole United   States."    Of the same lecture the Salt Lake Herald said: "It is  doing MR. ELLIS no more than mere justice to say that he  is the only non-Mormon lecturer who has ever attempted to   do the Mormon people justice. His style of address is most  pleasing and is calculated to hold the attention of an audience.  His subject was handled in a masterly manner.   It is a lecture that should be heard in every town and city  in Utah, and throughout the civilized world."    The Ogden Standard special from Salt Lake: "The  speaker (MR. ELLIS) handled his subject admirably and com-  manded excellent attention."    SECOND LECTURE:    "Utah Liberalism."    The Deseret Evening News said of this lecture: "The   lecturer showed and astounding famliarity with the history  of this Territory from 1870 to date, proving that he had given  the subject careful investigation.  The lecture  ought to be delivered in other parts of the Territory, especially  in the leading towns."

 Wm Jefferies  March 1 [18]97.    Grantsville, Mar. 1, 1897.    Prest. Wilford Woodruff,    Salt Lake City,    Dear Brother:    Your letter of the 23rd ult.,  calling my son Albert on a mission to   the Southern States was duly received  here. I forwarded it to him at Provo.  Today I received his reply, obtained the  Bishop's endorsement thereon, and en-  close is herewith. In the above you will  perceive the reason for the little delay in   replying.    And now I have a convenient opportu-  nity to attend to a little matter which of-   ten comes to my mind. It is this: In May,  1895, I sent you, for your endorsement, Prest.   Gowans's recommend, furnished by Brother   Lyman's suggestion, for me and my wife  to get our second endowments. At the same

MAIN ST., OPPOSITE TABERNACLE    LOGAN, UTAH, Aug 17 1897    President Wilford Woodruff.  Salt Lake City; Utah    Dear Brother.    In answer to your letter of  the 13th inst. I will say that I am well pleased  with the call to the Eastern States to preach  the Gospel. I will have all arrangements made  to start from Salt Lake City, September 18th 97  Hoping to have your faith and prayers, that I may  do a good work, while out in the world; I remain  your brother in the Gospel.

 time I wrote another letter or two, sealed  them up, and sent thew to the Post Office,  forgetting as I did so, to enclose stamps  for return postage. Soon after I remem-  bered the omission, and was bothered  and chagrined in my feelings—I felt  miserable. Later, I spoke to Bro. Lyman  about it, and he said it was all right,  but it would have been all right, too, if  I had enclosed stamps. I now enclose  3 stamps to fill that gap in my history,  and shall feel better for having done so.    I hope my son will fill a mission  that will satisfy you and the Lord.    This morning we celebrated your 90th  birthday. The meeting housewas full—ex-  tra seats had to be furnished. Choir, String  Band, Brass Band, Speakers, and so on,  occupied the time, and the good spirit  helped us out. May you live much long-  er to lead Israel!    Kind regards,    Your Bro. in the Gospel,  Wm. Jefferies.

No doubt you have received  my answer to your letter of 13th inst, by now, without  our bishop having indrosed it; and I hope you  will pardon me for being so forgetful.    As you know by now; I am well satified with the  call to the Eastern States to preach the Gospel.  I will have all arrangements made to leave Salt  Lake City September 18th, 1897.    Your brother in the Gospel.  Will L. McAlister.    P. S. I did not want to put you to so much  trouble in having you sent my other letter back  and that is why I have written this letter.    Bro Woodruff I heartily endorse  this young man, & feel that he will  do honor to the cause of truth.    B M. Lewis Bp Logan 1st wd
