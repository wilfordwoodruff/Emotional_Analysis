There was a large Organ  in the building. The Church of England still  worship in this building, they hold a time of  worship twice each day in a year, we stayed there one service.

O! Malvern thy lofty Hill bares up my feet while mine eyes take a survey of thy deep intrenchments thy mighty bulwarks ^which have^ trembled by the roar of cannon, the  clash of arms, &amp; din of war has reeched around thy brow  &amp; died away in the vale beneath, while the blood of many a roman &amp; Englishman to, have washed thy brow &amp; soaked thy soil while they have fallen to rise no more they sleep in death &amp; time has earth'd them all &amp; they are forgotten  &amp; blotted from the history &amp; memory of man.

It was destroyed  by fire in 961 &amp; rebuilt the following year. It was  not till the reign of London became  the metropolis of England &amp; it was to this prince more  perhaps than to any of his predecessors that the cath edral of St Paul was indebted for its permanant esta- blishment &amp; preeminance.

To the  reflecting mind it is evident, that no period of the nineteenth centaury hath presented greater  &amp; more important events to the world, &amp; lade a  foundation for still greater things to follow in  quick succession than 1840. It is also equ ally true in various ages of the world that  those subjects &amp; things which have been in  reality of the greatest importance to the whole  world even Subjects upon which the vary tempo- ral existance &amp; prosperity of the Nations of the  Earth hung, have been the most out of sight, the  last to attract the Publick mind, &amp; when discov- erd, considerd of the least consequence, scorned  &amp; ridiculed to the last by a thoughtless multitude  who like the ox going to the slaughter know not  ENDENTRY  ly the case in the Days of Cyrus  of the Days of Jesus Christ before the  overthrow of Jerrusalem &amp; the dispersion  of the Jews, among all the gentile nations  whare they have remained Deprived of the  privileges of the land of their fathers untill  the present day.

None feel more interested  in the signs of the Heavens &amp; the earth which  clearly indicate these great &amp; important ENDENTRY  Let us for a moment take a survey of 1840  which has been a year of interest among all  Nations. This is the tenth year of the church  of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. the church  has never been as prosperous as through 1840  though she has just passed through a seene  of unparelled persecution by the whole  state of Missouri, who has driven, robed  &amp; murdered many of ther saints, &amp; entirly  expeled from the state about 12,000 of  the Church, but as the persecution at Antioch  proved to spread the work abroad evrywhare  so it has been in this case, it has spread as  it were with tenfold rapidity not ownly  throughout America, but in Scotland  Ireland, some of the Lamanite or  American Indians have began to embrace the  fulness of the gospel which is an important  event in the History of the rise &amp; progress  of the church. While many of the Elders  have been lifting up their voices in the  most noted villages &amp; cities of America  The Twelve have been planting the work &amp; ENDENTRY  notable cities of Europe. During the year  1840 churches have been esstablished in  Worcester, Edin &amp; many other parts of England Scotland Wales &amp; South  Australia, the Germany more than 4,000 has been added to the church by Baptism in Europe in 1840, &amp; two of the Twelve have Started on a mission from Nauvoo to visit the Jews in the Holy land  of Jerrusalem. This indicates at least that  the Lord has set his hand to prune his vineya- rd one more for the last time to prepare the  way for his second advent, &amp; that he will  make a short work in the Eearth. &amp; cause light &amp; truth to prevail in the midst of this  seenery, the hand of God is evidently began to be lade in a degree upon the nations in Judment In the United States many have suffered The City of Natchez was instantly destroyed  by a whirlwind.

Wars &amp; rumours of wars are among the signs  of England feels at the present time as though she was swaying the sceptre over nearly all the earth, even for the first time  waving the british flag in China, still she  is not without her troubles, she is begining  to share in that distress of nations &amp;  plexity, which will be prominant among the signs  of the last days, great poverty prevails among  the working class in England &amp; more esspecially in Ireland, much crying for bread is heard in the streets. Erance has had great troubles from  sources she least expected, for while she had ENDENTRY  500,000 men to assist Mehemit Ali &amp; for other  purposes.

The French Chambers appropriated 5,000,000  of Frances Francs to relieve the present wants of the suffers  of those inundations. But among the signs  of 1840, none are more prominant than those of the eastern world, even in the Holy Land Mehemit Ali has made much noise in the world by invading Syria &amp; trying to take power  unto himself, &amp; as the Tirkish power was  not sufficient to check him in his progress England with other European Powers have  ENDENTRY  at their feet, but the effect of all these  movements have been to prepare the way for the return of the Jews to the land of there  Fathers, &amp; while the Lord is begining to give  the Jews favor in the eyes of Kings that they  may become their nursing fathers &amp; Queens their  nursing mothers, they begin to see it time for  them to make a right use of so favorable an  opportunity &amp; immediately return &amp; rebuild Jerrusalem, &amp; the call is now  forth among the Jews in all nations to ret- urn &amp; esspecially among the German continen tal Jews. A call of this Kind is published in  the (Der orient) a German Newspaper &amp; among many other things says "In no country of  the earth are our brethren so numerous as in  Syria, in none do they live in as dens masses  so independant of the surrounding inhabitants in none do they persevere so steadfastly in their  faith in the promise of the Fathers as on the bea- utiful shores of the Orontes.

Jews &amp; Christians have now an equal privilege in  Jerrusalem &amp; among other privileges are  permitted to gather their own taxes which  has not before been allowed them.

The most imposing events  are hanging over the worldâ€”at the vary doors â€” events which will put all past events in the  shadeâ€” obliterating all the epochs of the  human familyâ€” stamping a new era on the  annals of time! These things are true, and   our peace &amp; safety! these things are true  and are come on the world as a snare: aye as a snare or the scripures are not true.  Why as a snare? because the pulpit is crying  "peace &amp; safety"! O what a crash of governments thrones &amp; empires is awaiting the world, and the  pulpit is chaunting lullabies to its slumbering  care! war, pestilence and fire, standing in  dread array against the human family, and  the conservators of its moral weal, hailing  the dawn of universal pieceâ€”hailing  a millenial dawn, when the harbengers of  war and carnage are standing in bold relief over a guilty world.    from the presence of the Lord; when we are to have the vials of his wrath! They are  clothing in Brilliant Drapery, the future trium- phs of the gospel when the drama is about to  close and present a theatre of blood. They  are in imagination, smoothly gliding by the  gradual flow of time into a heaven of repose  without once turning an eye to an intervening  vortex, which is to engulph, perhaps, more  than half the human family! They are  spreading a banquet of peace and proclaiming   ENDENTRY  about to deluge the world in fire!

The measure of human crime is coming  to the full, and the arm of Omnipotence lifted  to "shake terribly the earth" and the watch  quarrelling about creeds, territory or gold.  The present Christian dispensation is about to  close like the Jewishâ€”the heavens about to  be rolled together like a scroll; the star in that  heaven about to be thrown from their  orbits, in wild consternation and the indications  overlooked; prophetic allusions to the  terrible wreck, mistaken, misapplied or applyed  to the wreck of Nature; an event without  foundation in holy writ.
