E side ofthe tower. The outside fracture is about5 ft long perpendicularly and averaging 6 inches in width. The part which passedthrough the N. side of the tower went downthe side of the tower till it reached themain roof; here it tore the roofing canvasfrom the fastenings on the inside ofthe main roof parapet, and apparentlywent down the roof drain pipe to thelarge cistern without doing furtherdamage.You will perceive that the damage is to Dome and Tower, consisting ofwoodwork and lash and plaster work. The main building is all right exceptthe two upper circular window frames onthe S. side of the tower. These are shatteredand blackened though but one light of 
 glass is fractured.Herewith please find enclosed Photographof the St George Temple which is sent toaid you in the understanding our descrip-tion. The red ink marks show the out-side damage as far as we can.Shall we repair the damage doneor not?

 Cardston. Aug. 17th 1896.Presidents. Wilford Woodruff, George Q. Cannon and Joseph F Smith,Salt Lake City.Beloved Leaders of Zion,There is a subject I feel to lay before you that has occupiedmy thought a great deal of late, so much so, that I wrotethe Church Historian, Apostle F. D. Richards, about it, but feel Ishould have writen you direct.It ^is^ concerning some very sacredobjects I once had the honor of calling my own. They are twoSeer Stones, and a flint arrow point. As you know, these choicerelics had once been the property of the Prophet Joseph, and later on,of my honored fathers. This fact alone tells how I prizedthem. Because of their great historical value, and sacred nature,I was led part with them, and put them where theyproperly belonged, into the hands of the President of the Church.There is a question naturally arises, If they are retained in 
 inform Bro Leithead.I also think that there is ^no^ needof useing any more Tithingtowards fixing up the ferry.The proceeds of the ferry shouldcertainly be enough to keep every-thing in repair from this timeon, and leave considerable towardsimproving the roads or for someother good purpose.  Please excuseme if I am too free in makingsuggestionsWe have been very busy forabout two months,  Have crossed since the first of August 393wagons.  I think the rush isnow over for the seasonThe weather has been very mild andpleasant during December thusfar.  With kind regards for yourselfand family, thanking you for allyour kindness to meI remain yours in the GospelWarren. M Johnson 
 CopyCambridgeport, Mass.,August 23rd, 1849.Elder Badlam,Dear Brother:We have received two long interesting letters from you, onefrom Panama and one after you had been in San Francisco about six days;also one from Chagress, making three in all. I have written several toyou, which I have sent by private conveyance, in shaips that go aroundCape Horn, and sister Badlam has sent several by steamer; but I have notseen any she has sent to you, and do not know what she has written, as Ihave generally been gone when she has written, and, not knowing how muchchurch news she has sent you, I feel it to be my duty to fill a sheet toyou and send it by mail, and perhaps I ought to have done it before this.You have been very diligent in writing to me and your family, and yourletters have been highly interesting. I feel thankful that you have gotalong so well and been prospered on your journey and arrived in safety atSan Francisco. I have felt to pray for you continually, from day today. Since you left here I have been gone from home most of the time,and have only remained at home about long enough to answer my correspond-ing letters, write my journal, and close up such work as seemed necessaryto be done, and then I am off again. I have visited Boston, or evenCambridgeport, but little since you left, only going and returning frommy journeys. I was much interested in the account you gave me of Pana-ma and journey from Chagres, also your success on the ship with the pas-sengers, and the account you gave after you landed.The New York Herald publishes every week a number of letters fromthe gold diggings of San Francisco, but they are very conflicting in thei^r^statements. I expect dry goods must be very cheap by this time in SanFrancisco. In order to do by you as you have done by me, I will go backto the time you left and give you a ^little^ history of events as they have passedalong with me since we parted. Soon after you left I wrote some lengthyletters to the Presidency in the Valley, spoke of your course, and theobject of your going to San Francisco, that you went with my counsel to.We were notified by the keepers of the Boydston Hall that we could have 
 families, as heir-looms, why should they not remain inthe family of Brigham Young? but this answer comes withgreat force, has any family a right to retain such importantand clearly, "church property" relics as individual posessions. Nothey should be forever retained as church property, "His mouth peice"being their guardian.Tell me are my impressions right? "Theright" is my only desire, and in your hands I leave it.The saints are in excellent health and aspirit of peace prevails, quite a number of new convert,and as usual, an excellant crop of "home emigrants."Good crops, plenty of rain, and nature smiles in her mantleof green. We are looking forward to ^a^ visit of some of thebrethren for our Sunday School and Quarterly Conferenceswith pleasure.With daily prayers for the blessings ofheaven upon you and yours, and an earnest desire that mycommunication will be received in the same spirit I have soughtwith prayer to pen it. I am ever your humble and devoted sister in the gospel, Zina Young Cardsee over. 
 In the absence of President WoodruffI would say that her views werequite correct on the subject, and there is now doubt that properarrangements will be madefor preserving relics of a sacredcharacter in the Temple, whereit would seem they could bemost properly cared for.J.

And I herebydelegate and apoint Elder Edson Whipple to cooperate with me inassisting me to carry out the instructions of the presidency inthe gathering of the Saints to Zion from the Eastern States at thislate hour of the day I call upon all the Saints that Elder Whipplemay visit to give heed to his instructions And carry out hisadvise and instructions upon the subject of the gathering And theBlessing of the Lord will rest upon you.

 St. George, Utah Apr. 12, 1887Mrs. Eliza R. Snow Smith,Beloved Sister, Honored Lady, and Inspired Poetess—While musing upon my exiled lonely bed last night, my thoughts turned on thee,and as I cannot visit you in person, I feel disposed to use my pen. I have beeninformed that you are in a low state of health and perhaps not likely to recover anda prospect of your closing your labors here in the flesh, and passing on to your laborsupon the other side of the Veil, I thought if that was the case, I would like to communi-cate with you before you left. I felt that if there is an immortal spirit dwelling in a mortamortal body that can lie down in death in sweet repose, it is Sister Eliza. When Icontemplate your life and labors of love to all classes of Latter-day Saints, the inspira-tion of your pen, which has cheered and encouraged Patriarchs, Prophets and Apostles andSaints in the deepest hours of their afflictions, sorrows, persecutions and death, andthe army of innocent children, the seed of Joseph, whose minds you have guided into pathsof virtue, truth, and holiness, in the organizations of the Primaries and labor in theSabbath Schools, Mutual Improvement Assoc., also your labors in the Relief Societies and in the Assemblies of the Saints, and your ominous labor in Holy Places for the dead.And that you have passed through all the afflictions, tribulations, and persecution withthe Saints and have dwelt in the flesh almost three generations, as man counts time, Isay when I reflect upon these things, I feel that you, sister Eliza, an elect Lady of theLord, can lay down your mortal body when the time comes without a sting, a pang or a regretand pass on to your work on the other side of the Veil to a far higher state of glorywhere you will find a host of Patriarchs, Prophets, Apostles and Saints, as well as a largearmy of children who await your coming and will greet you with joy and rejoicing. I cansay of a truth that your eye hath not seen, your ear heard, neither hath it entered intoyour heart to conceive the honor and glory that awaiteth you on the other side of the Veil.Through the blessing of God you have been enabled to create a name and fame that will neverbe forgotten through all time and eternity. Truly you will go down to the grave like a shockof corn fully ripe. When your spirit leaves your body you will find a host of friends togreet you who await your coming. I hope when I have finisehed my work I may be found worthyto meet with the same company that will greet you with joy. I feel that you can contemplateyour change from mortality to immortality with rejoicing. Should you meet with that company o[f]lo[y]al friends, that Heavenly throng before I do, I have ab a boon to ask of you, that youwill give my kind love to Joseph, Hyrum, Brigham, Heber, Willard, George and the hosts ofbrethren you will meet as well as those loyal sisters Mary Ann, Vilate, Phoebe, Margaret and tto the army of those faithful daughters of the Lord with whom we have both associated hereon earth. As to myself, I have just passed my fourscore years, I am still in very goodhealth, and as circumstances still deprive me of speaking in public to the living, I amtrying to labor what I can for the dead. I met on the 2nd of March 125 friends in theTemple of the Lord, 73 of which got endowments for my dead. I addressed them for a shorttime. I was sealed while there for 73 couple[s] of dead which makes about 3000 of my deadwhich I have done endowments and sealings for and which leaves me about 265 more to workfor before I finish my record which I am in hopes to live to accomplish. I have had agreat anxiety for the redemption of my dead while I dwell in the flesh. I met you in theSocial Hall at the reception on your 80th birthday but I do not recall your present age.I do not wish to weary you with a lengthy communication, neither do I wish to trouble youwith writing to me not knowing the state of you[r] health, but should your brother Lorenzobe with you or any friend who could send me a few lines to let me know your state of health,it would be a consolation to me. I pray God to bless you with joy and peace during yourremaining days and hours and when your hour of departure comes that you may die in the Lordand sleep in peace which is my earnest prayer.  Your Brother in the New and EverlastingCovenant.(Signed, Wilford WoodruffAny communication from any of my friends to me give to John Jaques at the Historians'Office, it will r[e]ach me. W. W. 
 that room no longer without doubling our rent; so we gave it up and haveheld no meeting in Boston since. I opened my own hired house for meet-ings on Sunday and one evening in the week, which I have kept up to thisday, except part of the time on Sunday at brother Bird's. I had fullhouses and I baptized a dozen or so. One was Mr. Snow and wife, a Uni-versalist, and a keeper of one of the engines; another was Andrew Delin,from Sweden, a smart man and one that I think will be useful in a futureday, in carrying the Gospel to his own nation. Another was father EzraCarter, Mrs. Woodruff's father. He was 78 years old, is smart, walkedto the top of Bunker Hill monument with me. He is strong in the faith.I was truly glad to baptize him, as he has been believing for seven yearsMrs. Woodruff feels that it amply pays her for coming to this country.Elder Whipple, one of the pioneers forom the Salt Lake Valley, spent sev-eral days with me, and brought several of his relatives out to meeting.Father Carter spent about one month with me. Calvin I. Foss, son ofsister Sarah B. Foss, also called upon me, and wished me to assist himin getting into a good company to go to the gold diggings; so afterlooking around, I got him into the Massachusetts Bay Store, Mining andTrading Company. He left for San Francisco on the ship Acrates, on the5th of April. I sent letters and papers to you by him. He wrote fromRio Janeiro, was getting along well. I expect he will call upon you.Nathaniel Holmes, of Bradford, died on the 20th of February, a Srtrangite.I left home early in the spring for the west, visited New Haven, New York,Philadelphia, and many other places. I assisted brother W. I. Applebyto start off for the Bluffs from Philadelphia, with a company of 80 Saint^s^50 from the Philadelphia Branch. He arrived at St. Louis all safe withall his family; baptized four of his family, three sons and one daughter,the day before he started. But when he arrived in St. Louis, the cholear^a^was raging in all its horrors, from New Orleans to Galena, and up theMissour^i^ River, and all over that state, slaying its thousands. Everysteamer on all those rivers was pickled with the cholora, and officers,crews, and passengers were dying by scores. He went on board of thesteamer Monroe, bound for St. Joseph's, with a company of soldiers or godl^d^diggers, bound for California, and the cholera was on board when he went on to it. About a hundred Saints went on with brother Appleby. By the 
 Mrs Emma S. Woodruff 
 time they had arrived at Jefferson City, all the gold diggers, 35, weredead but two; also the captain, mates, two clerks, one engineer, pilot,barkeeper, twelve boat hands, and fifteen of the Saints, including child-ren. The names of the Saints, as far as I can recollect, are as follows:From Philadelphia, Adams (tobacconist), his wife and two daughters, bro.Hand, Bro. Lamb, sister Hampton and part of family, sister Brown. FromSt. Louis, old mother Bokley, Sabra Granger and Lavina Hodges. When theboat landed, all the crew that was left, with the passengers, fled int^o^the city. It was reported in several letters that Elder Appleby wasdead, but it was false. He slipped on board of another boat, and arriv-ed at the Bluffs with his family and the rest of the company, all well,and is now on his way to the valley, with a company. I sent all of myletters and papers on by him.The cholera has been very fatal at St. Louis. They have had fromone to two hundred deaths in that city daily by cholera, in a populationof 50,000. There has been some 5000 deaths by cholera in that city infive weeks. It has swept all through Missouri; very fatal at Indepen-dence. It is said that 35,000 gold seekers, bound for San Francisco,have gone on to the plains to take the overland route via South Pass ofthe Rocky Mountains. They made their rendezvous at Independence, St.Joseph, Ford Kearney and Kanesville. The greatest number was at Inde-pendence. The papers say that the cholera was so bad in that town thatthe gold diggers all left in a fright, and did not stop to bury theirdead, but piled them up in their winding sheets by the way side in heapsof five and six together, and the road was strewn with the dead, until itwas awful and horrible in the extreme to behold; so say those who wit-nessed it. These companies had over 60,000 head of cattle and horses,and if the history of those companies does not tell a tale for the re-corder before they reach the gold diggings, then I am mistaken. Thous-ands of their cattle died before they got to the Black Hills, and manymen, and some thousands, are returning back. Cholera has been fatal atAlton, Quincy, Carthage, and many parts of Ill. About 5,000 deaths atCincinnati by it; about 50 deaths daily in Philadelphia and New York. Ithas ranged in Boston from 10 to 78 deaths daily, 78 being the highestnumber. It is still all around us, but on the decrease. It has been

 very fatal on the southern plantations; one man, out of forty blacks,lost thirty-nine. Many noted men have fallen this summer by the cholera,among whom are President Polk, General Gains, Worth, Col. Harding, Mrs.Madison. President Taylor has been attacked, but got better. The chol^-^era is also raging at the present time, through England, Paris, and mostof Europe. Many deaths are on most of the emigrant ships now landing atNew York. There has been but few deaths among the Saints, consideringthe many who have been among it. Capt. Jones and Spencer left Liverpoolin February with a fleet of six ships, with about 1500 Saints. All land^-^ed safe at New Orleans, and went from there to Council Bluffs in themidst of the worst time of the cholera. There was about fifty deathsout of the whole number, mostly on the Missouri River. Jones and Spen-cer are on their way to the valley. I do not know what success theSaints will have this season in crossing the mountains, as I should notthink there would be grass enough through the Black Hills for the animalsof the gold diggers alone to stand three tier deep upon. George A.Smith and E. T. Benson have gone with companies to the valley. ElderHyde is left at the Bluffs, still printing the papers and counselling thepeople. The Sa[i]nts at Pottawatomie Co. have escaped the cholera thisseason, while it has been all around them. Sanducky City, Ohio, had apopulation of 4,000, was entirely depopulated with the cholera, until there was not 400 left; every doctor, lawyer and priest in the place,with most of the population, died. There was none to attend to the sickor bury the dead, and the last account, many remained in their houses un-buried. There have been many calamities taking place in the Statessince you left. A mob of some 20,000 gathered at the Astor Place The-atre, broke in the doors and windows, was fired upon by the military, 25 killed, 50 wounded. Large mobs in Philadelphia once a month, more orless killed. More than one half of the business part of the City of St.Louis, Mo, is laid in ashes. It burned 600 ^six^ hundred stores and dwellings,all the insurance offices, five banking houses, telegraph office, 25steam boats, and a loss of six million ($6,000,000) dollars. They havehad another fire since; several steam boats and dwellings burned; a mobraised; some lives lost; the cholera followed the fire, and laid itsthousands in the grave. The Levee at New Orleans has been under water 
 in the House what does that mean and none of thefamily capable of getting 10 cts worth of Good pens theyare cheap. Now concerning the fish Hooks I willsay I cant Blame my self for getting fish hooks in myfinger but for travelling though such an immensthicket of Brush, I think you or most any Els havegone through that thicket & carried a fish line witha hook on it you would have got a hook in allyor fingers it was the worst body of Brush IEver attempted to to go through.

 broke away this spring, and New Orleans has been under water more than amonth, and the loss of property been immense. Watertown, New York, isburned up. Also $60,000 worth of Milwa^u^kie is also burned, and largefires in almost every town; many fires in Cambridgeport since you left.I have just returned from a mission of two months in New Brunswick, Mir-amichi, Prince Edward's Island, Nova Scotia, &c., and I have seen twohundred miles square of those provinces either burned over this spring orburning while I was there. Such fires were never known in that country.No rain in that country from April to August, and the fires got into theforest, and burned hundreds of miles over, sweeping fences, dwellings,barns, mill^s^, lumber yards, towns, cities, &c., all before it, in some in-stances driving the entire population on to the beach or into the sea. Itseems as though nearly the whole country was ruined, and the fires notbringing trouble enough, the people have risen in mobs, burned the Par-liament houses, and government property, stoned and egged the Governor,and the people seem bent on burning up everything that is left, and kill-ing each other. The day before I got to St. John's a company of Orangemen were marching in procession, were stoned by the Catholics, a fightensued; about twenty were killed and twice that number wounded. Theyfought with stones, clubs, rifles, muskets, &c. I was on the ground onthe occasion, and the doors and windows were riddled with bullets andslugs. The people were much excited the day I was there. I found thewhole country through which I travelled in a horrid state; the people in a state of starvation. No business going on; all trying to go to thestates for better. The people were leaving with their packs on theirbacks. I had a hard journey through that country; was sick part of thetime. I spent one week very pleasantly with Capt. Joseph Russell, ofMiramichi. He owns the whole Island he is on; has expended some $30,00^0^in buildings; says he will sell the whole at auction on the 5th of Sep-tember if he does not get ^£^50 for it. He has three new ships not sold,about 700 tons each, which he will sell in Liverpool market; will gofrom Council Bluffs to the valley one year from next spring. He sent upto brother Hyde of late ^£^330 to help meet those merchant debts. His son,who held the office of a Priest in the Church, died of late with the con-sumption, strong in the faith. He has now but two sons living. I

 baptized one of them; the other will be baptized by his father, who isan Elder and presiding over a small branch of the Church, and has a chap-el in his own house. Brother Russell went with me to Prince Edward'sIsland. We called upon William and John Maxfield; both have largefarms, but cannot sell them for anything. John Maxfield's mills haveshared the fate of others in that country, been burned to the ground bythe sweeping fires; they saved their dwellings. Property in the prov-inces will hardly bring cash at any price at the present time, and pros-pect of it being worse. I ordained William Maxfield an Elder, and ap-pointed him to preside over the branch there, of 32 members. There arebut four members left in Charlottetown. I sent word to brother and sis-ter Foss not to depend upon the fifty dollars left ba^y^ Giddle, until youreturned, for I did not think your family ought to be troubled with itwhile you were gone. I did not find but few Saints in that country.Brother Russell made particular enquiry about your welfare. Sister Bad-lam may have named to you, in her last letter, that sister Bride died oflate at St. Louis, of cholera. Sister Sayers was with sister ^Sabra^ Grangerwhen she died. Sister Sayers is well and gone to the valley.I had an interview, while at New York, with Elder Thomas Brown, fromLiverpool. He paid the fare of 42 families to the Bluffs, and one ladyof Wales paid the fare of 70 families, who went with Capt. Jones. Bro.Brown sent up 10,000 dollars worth of goods to the Bluffs. When he leftthey were baptizing about 1,000 per month in that land. There has beensome terrible ship wrecks on the Atlantic this season. Two ships de-stroyed by icebergs; 60 froze to death in one night on the ice. Anoth-er vessel about 200 lives lost. The last trip of the Europa had a col-lission with a Boston ship loaded with emigrants; the ship sank in fourminutes, 134 lost, 50 killed in the concussion. Many steamboat disas-ters, and many lives lost on the lakes and rivers, and many railroad dis-asters. You recollect Sidney Roberts writing a letter to you. Hepalmed himself off on the churches as being sent to collect money for thepoor. He collected several hundred dollars, got $70 out of the smallbranch in Fair Haven, Ct. Quite a number have been baptized through thevarious branches in this country this season. Little and Hardy arestill carrying on their merchandize, but all branches of business are

Brother Bird has been dangerously sick for few days, is nowgetting about again.The wars of Europe are still raging with great fury. The Frenchtroops have finally entered Rome. The Hungarian armies are defeatingthe united armies of Russia and Austria. Fifty-two thousand Jews arenow fighting with the Hungarians, against the Russians. The Jews havenow Rabbis in America collecting money to lay the foundation of theirtemple in Jerusalem. The signs of the times are big with events at thepresent day. As concerning your family since you have been gone, I willsay I think they have got along very well, as far as I know; they havemostly had good health. Alexander was attacked very suddenly with vom-iting and other sickness. I administered to him by anointing of oil,laying on of hands and prayer. He was well next day. I dont know ofany other sickness in the family. I have been gone from home so much,I have not been able to call upon them as much as I would like to. When-ever I have had an opportunity I have enquired into their circumstances.I do not think they have had an opportunity of selling but very littlevarnish since you went away. I told sister Badlam to let me know herwants, and I would divide with her. My means has been very limited thisseason. I have had as much as I could do to meet my rent, get bread formy family, and pay my travelling bills. She has never called upon mefor means, only in two or three instances, and then for a little change.I have always given double the amount called for, and the whole of it puttogether would hardly have bought a breakfast at San Francisco. A fewdays since she called for twenty five cents, and Mrs. Woodruff gave herfifty cents, and I gave her $5.00. I wish it had been a hundred, forI have no doubt that they needed it, but he that has not got cannot give.Mary had a [blank] little party last evening, and Rhoda and Phebe Foss,Mrs. Woodruff's nieces, who are at our house, attended, as Mary was goingaway on a visit for a while down to Cohasset. Mr. Mc.Clare has conveyedan idea to me that he intended to assist your family while you were gone,but do not expect that he has done much yet, except perhaps attending tosome bill or two which was due.

Smith,City.Dear Sisters:The labors which devolve upon Sister Zina in the Templeand those connected with the presidency of the Relief Society, promptus, in consideration of her advanced age, to suggest that she shouldhave some active help in answering correspondence she receives fromthe various branch societies throughout the Church. Sister Zina Y.Card is visiting here for the present, and we think she would be verysuitable to act as her mother's private secretary to attend to hercorrespondence and other labors connected therewith, that you, and allof you, may be relieved as far as possible from these duties that areso onerous upon you at your time of life.Trusting that this suggestion of ours, whiCch is madesolely in the interest of the Relief Society and to benefit each andall of you, will be received in the spirit in which it is offered, andpraying the Lord to bless you in all your labors, and to preserve yourlives, we remain, with kindest regards,Your Brethren,Wilford WoodruffGeo.

 President Woodruff, who waspresent at the conference where the discourse in question was deliveredand who then endorsed Brother Smith's statements; was asked the following question:"Did you understand Brother Smithto have any reference to politicalmatters in his remarks at Provo?""Not at all. I understood him to mean, just as he has now explained. At the same time I look at the subjectjust as Brother Smith does in regard to leading men of the Church being sotaken up with political matters that they cannot find time attend to the duties of their religious callings. Idon't think it would be right.As to dictating to men withregard to their political political opinionsor party connections, we don't do any-thing of the kind. We don't want todo that, we don't intend to do it, andif we did want to I don't think itwould be any use. To tell you thetruth I am about tired of myself andmy brethren being accused of inter-fering with the political concerns ofthe people I have frequently statedmy position on the subject as plainly as I can tell it in words, and if peopleinsist in pretending not to understandme, I cannot help it. My actions speakas plainly as my words. That isall I care about saying on the subject." 
 to remember you when I go before the Lord. I also wish an interest inyour prayers. I have never seen a time in my day when there has beensuch a flood of prophecy and revelation fulfilling as at the present time.I hope and trust we may live in such a manner as to be prepared for theevents which are rolling like a flood upon the earth, and are startlingto the nations in very deed. I pray that this sheet may reach you insafety. And that the God of [illegible] Israel will prosper you in yourlaudable undertaking, keep you from all harm and danger, return you insafety to the bosom of your family, is the prayer of your brother andfriend in the kingdom of God,Wilford Woodruff.

Andwe ask thee, our Father in heaven,in the name of thy son Jesus Christ,that thou wilt accept of this Tem-ple at the hands of thy Saints, bothmale and female who have builtunto thy holy name, and may nounclean thing be permitted to entertherein. Wilt thou bless all thyservants and handmaidens withthe spirit and power of God, whoshall administer in any of the ordi-nances of life and salvation withinthe walls of this house, and ail thypeople who enter the threshold ofthis Temple? May they feel thy pow-er, and be constrained to acknow-ledge that the power of God restsupon it. And we ask, in the nameof Jesus Christ, the son of the liv-ing God, that the prayers offered upin the further dedication of other parts of this house this day, or atany future time in the dedicationof this house, by those holding theApostleship or Holy Priesthood,that their prayers may enter into the ears of the Lord of Sabbaoth,and be answered upon the heads ofthy people. O Lord, be not angrywith thy servants while we con-tinue our supplications before theein this the Temple of our God.Thou hast said that thou wouldsttake unto thyself them whomthou wouldst take, and preservein life them whom thouwouldst preserve. Thou hast takenunto thyself thine aged servant, thepatriarch Joseph Smith and his sonsJoseph, Hyrum, Carlos and Samuel, and many others of thyservants, but thou hast raised upunto thyself thy servant Brigham Young as a law-giver unto Israel and leader of thy people. Thouhast taken unto thyself his coun-sellors Willard, Jedediah, Heber,and George A., yet thou hast sus-tained thy servant Brigham for ageneration, as men count time, bythe right hand of thy power. Hehas been with thy people throughall their afflications and persecu-tions, and led them unto these moun-tains of Israel, and guided and di-rected the settlement of thy Saintsand all the affairs of Zion, as inspir-ed by the power of God in this thelast dispensation and fullness of times, in the which thou hast saidthou wouldst establish thy king-dom, to be thrown down no moreforever. Therefore, O Lord ourGod, we pray that thou wilt givethy people faith that we mayclaim this blessing of thee, the Lordof Hosts, that thou wilt lay thyhand upon thy servant Brighamunto the renewal of his body andthe healing of all of his infirmities,and the lengthening out of his daysand years; yea, Lord, may he live to be behold the inhabitants ofZion united and enter into the holyorder of God and keep the celestial law, that they may be justified be-fore thee. May he live to beholdZion redeemed, and successfullyfight the devils, visible and invisi-ble, that make war upon thy Saints.May he live to behold other tem-ples built and dedicated unto thyname and accepted of thee, O Lordour God. And we pray thee, ourFather in Heaven, in the name ofJesus Christ, if it can be consistentwith thy will, that thy servantBrigham my stand in the flesh tobehold the nation which now occu-pies the land upon which thou,Lord, hast said the Zion of Godshould stand in the latter days, thatnation which shed of the blood of theProphets and Saints which cry untoGod day and night for vengeance,the nation which is making waragainst God and his Christ, thatnation whose sins, wickedness, andabominations are ascending up be-fore God and the heavenly host,which causeth all eternity to bepained and the heavens to weeplike the falling rain; yea, O Lord, that he may live to see thatnation, if it will not repent, broken in pieces like a potter's ves-sel and swept from off the earth aswith the besom of destruction, aswere the Jaredites and Nephites,that the land of Zion may cease togroan under the wickedness andabominations of men. We pray thee, O God our Heavenly Fatherthat thou wilt bless all the coun-sellors to thy servant Brigham.Bless thy servant John W. Young,his first counsellor, that he may beclothed upon with the power ofGod, that he may be a polishedshaft in thy quiver in the defense ofZion and her cause. May he com-fort the heart of his father and havethe blessings of God and thy peopleupon his head. Bless the house-hold of thy servant Brigham,his wives and children. May his pos-terity remain upon the earth inrighteousness until the coming ofthe Messiah and through the mil-lennium. Bless thy servant Dan-iel H. Wells with the spirit andpower of God, and all his house-hold. Bless all the counsellorsto thy servant Brigham with theirwives and children and all apper-taining unto them. Bless, O Lord, thine Apostles, that the spirit andpower of the apostleship may restupon them. Bless their wives and children with salvation and eter-nal life, and may all the Apostlesof the Lamb of this last dispensa-tion and fulness of times realizetheir responsibilities before God,angels and men, and magnify theircalling in that way and mannerthat they will be satisfied at theend of their labor. Bless, O Lord,thy servant George Q. Cannon, whois our delegate appointed to repre-sent us in the Capitol of our na-tion. Clothe him thy power,O God, and enable him to do thywill, that his garments may beclean of the blood of this nation,that they may be left without ex-cuse in the day of thy judgementsupon them. O Lord, bless the Pa-triarchs whom thou hast appointedin the land of Zion. May they have power to bless the people byinspiration, as did the ancients,that their blessings may be fulfilledupon the heads of the Saints. Blesstheir families and all appertainingunto them. We pray thee, O Lord, to bless the High Priests' quorumthroughout the land of Zion. Maythe power of the priesthood restupon them that they magnifytheir calling and have power tobuild up the Zion of God on theearth. Bless their wives and chil-dren and all appertaining untothem. We pray thee, our heav-enly Father, to bless the quorumsof Seventies, with their presidents.They are called to be special mes-sengers to the nations of the earth.Clothe them with the testimonyof Jesus Christ. We pray thee thatthey may bring many souls untoChrist, and be prepared to assist inbinding the law and sealing thetestimony among the Gentiles inthine own due time. Bless theirwives and children and all theirhouseholds. May the blessings of God rest upon all the Elders of Is-rael in all the world, with theirfamilies. O our Father in heaven,we pray thee to remember inmercy the Aaronic Priesthood,with their bishops, priests, teachers anddeacons, who are appointed to bestanding ministers unto the church.Clothe them with the power ofGod, salvation and eternal life,with their wives and children. Bless we pray thee, thine agedservant Edward Hunter, who iscalled to preside over the bishop-ric. Thou hast seen he labors andthou knowest the integrity of hisheart. Clothe him with thy holyspirit, fill him with the spirit ofcouncil and consolation to hisbrethren, and preserve him in theflesh as long as he shall desire life,and when he sleeps may he rest inpeace and the works of righteous-ness follow him. Bless all the or-ganizations of thy church andkingdom throughout the world.May thy people accomplish thework unto which they are ordained,build up the Zion of God andprepare the earth for the comingof the Son of Man. Bless theFemale Relief Societies throughoutthe land of Zion. May they fullyaccomplish the object of their or-ganization by thy servant Joseph.May they influence the daughters ofZion to walk in the paths of virtue,holiness, righteousness, and truth.May the blessings of Sarah, Hulda,Hannah, Anna and Mary, the an-cient prophetesses and holy womenof old, rest upon them. O God ofAbraham, Isaac and Jacob, we askthee, in the name of Jesus Christthy Son, that thou wouldst remem-ber thy covenants which thou hastmade with the whole house of Is-rael; remember them in all theirabidings in these last days. Wepray thee, in this the Temple of ourGod, that thou wilt make barethine arm of power in the preserv-ation and salvation of the smallremnant of the Lamanites that areleft in the land. Deliver them, OGod, from the hand of the Gentiles,who seek to annihilate them fromoff the face of the earth. Inspiretheir hearts with thy spirit, to re-ceive the gospel of the Son of God,that they may be prepared to buildup Zion and fulfil and covenantsand promises made unto them bytheir forefathers who inherited thisland. Remember, O Lord, thy cov-enant people in the north country.Hasten the day when they shallcome in remembrance before thee, when the Prophets shall smite therocks and the mountains of ice flowdown before them. May the high-way speedily be cast up in themidst of the great deep, that theymay come over dry shod. May theeverlasting hills tremble at theirpresence and their enemies becomea prey unto them. May they comeforth unto Zion and bow the knee,that they may be crowned in Zionunder the hands of Ephraim thyservants. We also pray thee, OGod, that thou wilt remember inmercy the sons of Judah, uponwhose heads the blood of JesusChrist has rested for eighteen hun-dred years. They have beentrampled under the feet of theGentiles and been made a hiss andby word in fulfillment of thewords of Moses, their law-giver, and of Jesus of Nazareth, and wepray thee, oh thou great Eloheim,that the past may suffice. Inspiretheir hearts to return home to Jeru-salem, the land of their fathers, andrebuild their city and Temple, thatthey may be prepared for the com-ing of Shiloh, their King. O hear,O hear us, Lord, in these our peti-tions, and answer us from heaven,thine holy habitation, and we willascribe all honor, glory, and thanks-giving unto God and the Lamb, both now and forever. Amen, andAmen." 
 42 Clington L'pool Eng.Aug 20th 1892Prest Wilford Woodruff—Salt Lake City UtahDear Brother—I have nodisire to increase your burdens God knowsyou have enough to bear, but I have been muchexercised concerning a few points contained inBro. Roberts lecture ^which he^ delivered before the Mutual Im-provement Asson on authority of Priesthood.I quote a few of eseveral items which have cometo my mind, and in all that I say I desire to giveno offence to my brethren in any particular. I cannot say there is one iota of untruth contained in thelecture, but in my judgement the lecturer does not ex-plain, sufficiently, points of vital importance. These ^points^"are a double signifficance at this period of politicalexcitement; and ^the^ puting forth "liberal" ideas ^in political matters^ whichhave brought our Republic to the verge of desolution,and will ^yet^ prove an important factors in the ultimate[ov]erthrow of man made governments, vis perfect freedom[faded text]ie, debauch, the stronger oppress the weak, the rich grow[ri]cher the poor grow poorer; the spirit shrink and the body[en]large its beastly propensities, are distressing to contemplate.Please give any ideas consideration and send me the[ad]vice and counsel that is necessary to make ^me^ wise as a

 serpent and harmless as a dove.I have always bileived that, when, when Christs authorized servants have it revealed unto them that a certainman was the individual to preside over the Church—Hischurch, this might be sustained, but not revoked by His peoples.I have the privilege of showing to God and man that, I amin harmony with that revelation and my sign of Cove-nant is the evidence, which I can produce on the spot,of my unswerving allegiance to Him. All things are done bycommon consent which comes through obedience to the[Lo]rd."Joseph presided over the church by the voice of thepeople." Very true. And the people were the churchof Christ because they sustained His prophet, which is equally true."Joseph presided over the church etc." "The people choseto have it so." "He always filled that station by the voiceof the people." These statements are all true but I thinkthat, with^out^ further explenation they are calculated to mis-lead the minds of our children. If it is deemed wisdomto leave these things as they are as they appear in print, Iam content. Please render me a little assistance to putthe break on with a little mode [more] force."Ecclesiastical governments as well as civil derivetheir just powers from the consent of the governed." I am in-clined to think that, there is a destinction between to the ^two^ go[vern-]ments. God calls and authorizes a man, he gathers the peopleand they sustani [sustain] him. Men gather and appoint ^or elect^ theirhead. One originates in God, the other in man.

 In comparison God has a fine stepper properly harnessto his ^[illegible]^ to assist the brethen; while man has nothing buta push cart. True, majorities controle in the world &they ^the wicked^ will seek to push this doctrine upon us, on purposeto destroy the church. I know their cunning is not equal tothe wisdom of God, and I pray for strength to stand whenthese two powers will, apparently, as nearly lie that the boldestwill tremble in the conflict. A bare majority of the people mayreject the prophets of God and by their votes sustain men more con-genial to their tastes, but in doing this they cut out the only receivingoffice on the line through which revelation can come to them. The mi-nority who sustain the prophet by their votes, are all that is left of thechurch of Christ.The agency of man consists in his having ^had^ power delegatedto him to select his master. I exercise my will power by beingobedient to the chosen of the Lord. I beleive our youth should betaught to sustain the authorities of the church irrespective ofof numbers. I fix my eyes upon you; I listen to your counsel,I try to live to have the same spirit that actuates you. The testimony ofthe spirit in me is that your mistakes—should you make any—will beoverruled by God for His glory and the good of His people. I beseechthe Father to give me strength to follow you as you follow Christ our Lord.Will the time ever come when a majority of those claiming mem-bership in the church—whatever object they have had in forming thechurch—will reject the Presidency and apostles by vote in the generalassembly of the people. I beleive the devil has that little game on foot—that it, the idea, exists in the hearts of men to day.I am content to leave things as they are for now I feel better. If Ihave hurt your feelings in any wise forgive me. I could not rest until I hadchatted with the presidency.I strive to do my duty in my weak way. In contrast with the brightness[o]f the more faithful elders, there is much of the old fogy in me I find.Love to the brethren. God bless you dear brotherI am yours in Christ.Brigham Young

Hardy and Enoch R. Dailey to spend a portion of their time in watching around among the cattle and herds to see that the stock are not stollen: and should itrequire any more let them be employed as herdsmen and watchmenand they should go armed, and inasmuch as they devote their time to this purpose they should have their reward, and all menshould be on the watch at the present time so far as possible. We wish to avoid any war, fight, or quarrel with the Indians as far as possible in the absence of the Presidency.Bishop Hunter has requested that the above named brethrenbe employed as herein recommended.W.

 Written in L Snows Letter to Br BernhiselApril 1st [18]50Brother BernhiselI answered your enquiries aboutthe withdrawing of our petition I do not know whetheryou got the Letter or not as I have heard Nothing fromyou since I feel to say a few weeks in this sheetupon the subject as follows. If on consideration youthink it best to withdraw the petition & the committeesor Territories & all other concerned will permit it & letit drop then it might be well to do so but if bywithdrawing the petition it would not change the actionof Congress But if they would still go on & passLaws concerning a Territorial government for Deseret, itwould be better to let the petition remain thento withdraw it if it made the matter worseall these things will have to be left to your ownjudgment & circumstancesYours TrulyW Woodruff.

 goods & endure the fatigues of a journey of sometwo thousands miles still these pesecuters arenot satisfyed with this but are striving tostir up every wicked & ungodly character in theirpower to palm off all their Black deeds ofinfamy & and crime upon the Saints in orderthat all the world far & near may varilythink they are doing Gods service while persecutingthe saints. But the day will come when allmen will get there reward for the Deeds done inthe Body. I hope & trust that the Saints through-out this land will not be weary in welldoingbut sustain the general cause of Zion & eachother by prayer, Love, charity, faith & all good worksMy stay in your midst on this mission hasben limited to one year But I rejoice much atthe progress, prosperity & prospects of the cause duringthis peroiod.

ButBrother Hornor whiclhe I realize that your standing inthe Church & Kingdom of God as well as your highposition in the minds of all business men who knowyou as a man of business, integrity, & honour all forbidany suspicions in the minds of your friends that you would make any breach of trust by appropriating the money for anyother purpose ownly for which it was sent. yet a delay inthe matter creates a degree of uneasiness to know what isis come. I have thought it was in consequese of yourLamenets as I heard you had froze your feet & cameNigh looseing your Life which I was sorry to learn. if thisreaches you in St Joseph I hope you will write meimmediately without delay & give me a statement of facts as theyare upon the subject

Andwe ask thee, our Father in heaven,in the name of thy son Jesus Christ,that thou wilt accept of this Tem-ple at the hands of thy Saints, bothmale and female, who have built itunto thy holy name, and may nounclean thing be permitted to entertherein. Wilt thou bless all thyservants and handmaidens withthe spirit and power of God, whoshall administer in any of the ordi-nances of life and salvation withinthe walls of this house, and all thypeople who enter the threshold ofthis Temple? May they feel thy pow-er, and be constrained to acknow-ledge that the power of God restsupon it. And we ask, in the nameof Jesus Christ, the son of the liv-ing God, that the prayers offered upin the further dedication of other parts of this house this day, or atany future time in the dedicationof this house, by those holding the Apostleship or Holy Priesthood,that their prayers may enter intothe ears of the Lord of Sabbaoth,and be answered upon the heads ofthy people. O Lord, be not angrywith thy servants while we con-tinue our supplications before theein this the Temple of our God.Thou hast said that thou wouldsttake unto thyself them whomthou wouldst take, and preservein life them whom thouwouldst preserve. Thou hast takenunto thyself thine aged servant, thePatriarch Joseph Smith, and hissons Joseph, Hyrum, Carlos andSamuel, and many others of thyservants, but thou hast raised upunto thyself thy servant Brigham Young as a law-giver unto Israeland a leader of thy people. Thouhas taken unto thyself his coun-sellors Willard, Jedediah, Heber,and George A., yet thou has sus-tained thy servant Brigham for a generation, as men count time, bythe right hand of thy power. Hehas been with thy people throughall their afflictions and persecu-tions, and led them to these moun-tains of Israel, and guided and di-rected the settlement of thy Saintsand all the affairs of Zion, as inspir-ed by the power of God in this thelast dispensation and fullness of times, in the which thou hast saidthou wouldst establish thy king-dom, to be thrown down no moreforever. Therefore, O Lord our God, we pray that thou wilt give thy people faith, that we mayclaim this blessing of thee, the Lordof Hosts, that thou wilt lay thyhand upon thy servant Brighamunto the renewal of his body andthe healing of all of his infirmities,and the lengthening out of his daysand years; yea, O Lord, may helive to behold the inhabitants ofZion united and enter into the holyorder of God and keep the celestiallaw, that they may be justified be-fore thee. May he live to behold Zion redeemed, and succcessfullyfight the devils, visible and invisi-ble, that make war upon thy Saints.May he live to behold other tem-ples built and dedicated unto thyname and accepted of thee, O Lordour God. And we pray thee, ourFather in Heaven, in the name ofJesus Christ, if it can be consistentwith thy will, that thy servantBrigham may stand in the flesh tobehold the nation which now occu-pies the land upon which thou,Lord, hast said the Zion of Godshould stand in the latter days, thatnation which shed the blood of the Prophets and Saints which cry untoGod day and night for vengeance, the nation which is making waragainst God and his Christ, thatnation whose sins, wickedness, and abominations are ascending up be-fore God and the heavenly host,which causeth all eternity to bepained and the heavens to weeplike the falling rain; yea, OLord, that he may live to see thatnation, if it will not repent,broken in pieces like a potter's ves-sel and swept from off the earth aswith the besom of destruction, aswere the Jaredites and Nephites,that the land of Zion may cease togroan under the wickedness and abominations of men. We praythee, O God our Heavenly Father,that thou wilt bless all the coun-sellors to thy servant Brigham. Bless thy servant John W. Young,his first counsellor, that he may beclothed upon with the power ofGod, that he may be a polishedshaft in thy quiver in the defense ofZion and her cause. May he com-fort the heart of his father and havethe blessings of God and thy peopleupon his head. Bless the house-hold of thy servant Brigham, hiswives and children. May his pos-terity remain upon the earth inrighteousness until the coming ofthe Messiah and through the Mil-lennium. Bless thy servant Dan-iel H. Wells with the spirit andpower of God, and all his house-hold. Bless all the counsellors tothy servant Brigham, with theirwives and children and all apper-taining unto them. Bless, O Lord,thine Apostles, that the spirit andpower of the apostleship may restupon them. Bless their wives andchildren with salvation and eter-nal life, and may all the Apostlesof the Lamb of this last dispensa-tion and fullness of times realizetheir responsibilities before God,angels and men, and magnify their calling in that way and mannerthat they will be satisfied at theend of their labor. Bless, O Lord,thy servant George Q. Cannon, whois our Delegate appointed repre-sent us in the Capitol of our na-tion. Clothe him with thy power,O God, and enable him to do thywill, that his garments may beclean of the blood of this nation,that they may be left without ex-cuse in the day of thy judgments upon them. O Lord, bless the Pa-triarchs whom thou hast appointedin the land of Zion. May theyhave power to bless the people by inspiration, as did the ancients,that their blessings may be fulfilled upon the heads of the Saints. Blesstheir families and all appertainingunto them. We pray thee, O Lord,to bless the High Priests' Quorumthroughout the land of Zion. Maythe power of the priesthood restupon them, that they may magnifytheir calling and have power tobuild up the Zion of God on theearth. Bless their wives and chil-dren and all appertaining unto them. We pray thee, our heav-enly Father, to bless the quorums of Seventies, with their Presidents.They are called to be special mes-sengers to the nations of the earth. Clothe them with the testimonyof Jesus Christ. We pray thee thatthey may bring many souls untoChrist, and be prepared to assist inbinding the law and sealing thetestimony among the Gentiles inthine own due time. Bless theirwives and children and all theirhouseholds. May the blessings ofGod rest upon all the Elders of Is-rael in all the world, with theirfamilies. O our Father in heaven,we pray thee to remember inmercy the Aaronic Priesthood, withtheir bishops, priests, teachers anddeacons, who are appointed to bestanding ministers unto the church. Clothe them with the power ofGod, salvation and eternal life,with their wives and children. Bless, we pray thee, thine agedservant Edward Hunter, who iscalled to preside over the bishop-ric. Thou hast seen his labors and thou knowest the integrity of hisheart. Clothe him with thy holy spirit, fill him with the spirit ofcounsel and consolation to hisbrethren, and preserve him in theflesh as long as he shall desire life,and when he sleeps may he rest inpeace and the works of righteous-ness follow him. Bless all the or-ganizations of thy church and kingdom throughout the world. May thy people accomplish thework unto which they are ordained,build up the Zion of God andprepare the earth for the comingof the Son of Man. Bless theFemale Relief Societies throughoutthe land of Zion. May they fullyaccomplish the object of their or-ganization by thy servant Joseph.May they influence the daughters ofZion to walk in the paths of virtue,holiness, righteousness, and truth.May the blessings of Sarah, Hulda,Hannah, Anna and Mary, the an-cient prophetesses and holy women of old, rest upon them. O God ofAbraham, Isaac and Jacob, we askthee, in the name of Jesus Christthy son, that thou wouldst remem-ber thy covenants which thou hastmade with the whole house of Is-rael; remember them in all their abidings in these last days. Wepray thee, in this the Temple of our God, that thou wilt make barethine arm of power in the preserv-ation and salvation of the smallremnant of the Lamanites that areleft in the land. Deliver them, OGod, from the hand of the Gentiles,who seek to annihilate them fromoff the face of the earth. Inspiretheir hearts with thy spirit, to re-ceive the gospel of the Son of God,that they may be prepared to buildup Zion and fulfil the covenantsand promises made unto them bytheir forefathers who inherited thisland. Remember, O Lord, thy cov-enant people in the north country.Hasten the day when they shall come in remembrance before thee,when the Prophets shall smite therocks and the mountains of ice flowdown before them. May the high-way speedily be cast up in themidst of the great deep, that theymay come over dry shod. May the everlasting hills tremble at theirpresence and their enemies becomea prey unto them. May they comeforth unto Zion and bow the knee,that they may be crowned in Zionunder the hands of Ephraim thyservants. We also pray thee, OGod, that thou wilt remember inmercy the sons of Judah, uponwhose heads the blood of JesusChrist has rested for eighteen hun-dred years. They have been trampled under the feet of theGentiles and been made a hiss andby word in fulfillment of thewords of Moses, their law-giver,and of Jesus of Nazareth, and wepray thee, oh thou great Eloheim,that the past may suffice. Inspiretheir hearts to return home to Jeru-salem, the land of their fathers, andrebuild their city and Temple, thatthey may be prepared for the com-ing of Shiloh, their King. O hear, O hear us, Lord, in these our peti-tions, and answer us from heaven,thine holy habitation, and we willascribe all honor, glory, and thanks-giving unto God and the Lamb,both now and forever. Amen, andAmen."

 FIRST LECTURE:"Utah from 1847 to 1870."Of this lecture the Deseret Evening News said: "Thelecture was replete with information on the subject handledby MR. ELLIS; his logic was irresistable, and his sentences wereat times arrayed in the eloquence of an orator who isconscious of defending the truth in the midst of opposition.The lecture should be heard throughout the whole United States."Of the same lecture the Salt Lake Herald said: "It isdoing MR. ELLIS no more than mere justice to say that heis the only non-Mormon lecturer who has ever attempted to do the Mormon people justice. His style of address is mostpleasing and is calculated to hold the attention of an audience.His subject was handled in a masterly manner. It is a lecture that should be heard in every town and cityin Utah, and throughout the civilized world."The Ogden Standard special from Salt Lake: "Thespeaker (MR. ELLIS) handled his subject admirably and com-manded excellent attention."SECOND LECTURE:"Utah Liberalism."The Deseret Evening News said of this lecture: "The lecturer showed and astounding famliarity with the historyof this Territory from 1870 to date, proving that he had giventhe subject careful investigation.  The lectureought to be delivered in other parts of the Territory, especiallyin the leading towns."

Soon after I remem-bered the omission, and was botheredand chagrined in my feelings—I feltmiserable. Later, I spoke to Bro. Lymanabout it, and he said it was all right,but it would have been all right, too, ifI had enclosed stamps. I now enclose3 stamps to fill that gap in my history,and shall feel better for having done so.I hope my son will fill a missionthat will satisfy you and the Lord.This morning we celebrated your 90thbirthday.
