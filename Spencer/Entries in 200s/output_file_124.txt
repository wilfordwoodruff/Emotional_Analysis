Thus Ends 1869  and it has Been a vary important year in many respects The great National  Pacific was built during this year also the Utah Central  Rail Road was Built from Salt Lake City The first  Rail Road Built By the Latter Day Saints &amp; owned By Them, And  the first Rail Road Built in America. Built By working men  without Assistance from Government, or large capitalist, this  is Built By the Poor Saints &amp; owned By them without assistance from  any one Ex Between Salt Lake City &amp; all the world. We Emigrated about 3000 Saints during this year. We have Lost during the past year One of our Number of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles Viz Albert Carrington was  Appointed in his stead.

Harrison W others have Been cut off from the Church for Aposticy &amp;  they have formed themselve into a New Church the same as other Apostates Have at different times and  they have Become Spiritualist &amp; pretend to receive Rev- ilations. Wickedness is increasing throughout this  whole Nation &amp; Exhertions are making to try to destroy  the kingdom of God. The Nations of the Earth are becoming  more &amp; more fearful of the signs of the times &amp; of the future  Events which await them.
