 as lady-teacher.  The school is well furnished, occupies two commo-tions classrooms in a house within the Tabernacle-enclosure, and wasin fine working order the second day after the inaugaration.  TheGunnison Seminary occupies the Relief Society House, and opened with28 students but with fair prospects of large increase.  An upper roomis being rapidly put into shape for [days purposes] Both principalsof these institutions are earnest and [illegible] expect most school-wor-kers and are endeavering to ma[ke] [3 illegible words] actions perma-nent intending to settle down this [illegible 3 words].The Stake Academy at Ephraim [Alm]a Greenwood Principal,has opened with about 25 students [illegible] of the of the Inter[med]iat and Academic Grades, with expectations of a large attendance duringthe coming winter.  Bro. Greenwood is assisted by Bro. Wm.Winter.  The Stake board owns a large building, occupied atpresent by the District school, but wont take possession nextyear. The course of studies in the Academy is very creditable tothe teachers, both in regard to the spirit, methods, and organiza-tion, as well as to the results.The Mt. Pleasant Seminary, Bro. Geo. Christensen, Principal,and Miss Augusta Erickson, Assistant, has opened its secondschool year with but 24 students, of the Intermediate andPreparatory Grades, occupying at present only one classroomBro. Christensen being one of our best churchschool-teachers,exercises a most beneficent influence over the youth of Mt.Pleasant, and it is only to be feared, that the Authorities theremay overload him with too many appointments, on the 
 continuedprinciple of the "willing ox".  Although the Local Board atManti will have a schoolhouse of its own in another year, when theboard of the School-Trustees expires, some assistance will become ne-cessary, in as much as the Presbyterians are erecting a beautifulAcademy-building, and propose to fit it up with all the appur-tenances of modern education in order to swamp our Seminary.All the Boards of Education in Sanpete, with Pres. Peterson at theirhead, and strongly supported by Apostle Lund, are doing theirutmost to advance the cause of their youth.The Juab Stake Academy, at Nephi, Bro. Wm. H. Jones, Principal, andMiss Mattie Nelson, Assistant, opened Oct. 13. with 37 students intwo Departments, Intermediate and Primary.  The house is well-furnished and reflects much credit upon the energy and goodjudgement of the Stake Board.  The people of Nephi seem to be in earnest to support their churchschool.  Bro. Jones is getting quitereadily into line with our educational system, in which he is ablysupported by Mrs. Nelson, who is as Graduate of the B. Y. A. familiarlady with it.  The attendance at that Academy has increasedconsiderable since opening.The L.D.S. College 18 Ward Seminary, 14 Ward Seminary,and Central Seminary at the Cottonwoods, have also beenvisited by me and found in a flourishing condition.  These 
 four institutions of Salt Lake Stake had a full attendance at the first day of opening, so that many more refused admittance forwant ofo room.  I should suggest that at least two more Seminariesbe organized in S.L. City, one in the northwest and one in thesoutheast, and then another one somewhere over Jordan inthe southwestern part of the county, or at Draper.The new Seminary organized at Parowan, and opened Oct. 13.with Bro Edwin Cutler, Principal, reports very favorable progressand the people of that place seem to be determined to supporttheir own churchschool with all their might.Many causes have combined this year to create a considerableiregularity in the time of opening of our churchschools, and inthe applications for teachers, through which circumstances I havebeen placed several times into very perplexing situations. Withthe help of the Lord, however, these difficulties have been over-come thus far, and all our schools with the exception ofSpringville and Kaysville, are now in working order,Al all together.At a meeting of the Stake Board at Ephraim the question was raised, if donations should be given rather to the Stake Academyrather to the Temple.  I had no authority to give an answer, andsubmit it, therefore, to your decision.  It also was proposedat that occasion to divide the appropriation from theGeneral Board with some Seminary, which is also submittedhere with.An objection to lady-students opening or closing the school 
 continuedwith prayer, when students holding the Priesthood are present,has been raised by one of the Principals.  As I have never madeany distinction in this regard between male and female stu-dents but have called on them from the list of volunteersfor this purpose, I desire to be corrected, if I have been wrong inthis.In conformity with the motion carried at the last session ofthe General Board to organize our ^#1^churchschools into "District-Conventions" for the purpose of mutual improvement of our teach-ers and of the establishment of greater uniformity in the methodsof teaching, I have proceeded in starting this movement; andorganized "Districts" recording their geographical position asfollows:1. "Idaho District," comprising the churchschools at Oakley,Preston, Malad, Rexburg, Paris, and Randolph, with Bro.John H. Miles as temporary chairman, pending a permanentorganization, which will have to determine, times and placeof meeting, program, and appointments.2. "Weber District," comprising the churchschools at Brigham,Ogden, Morgan, and Coalville, with Bro. L. F. Moench as tem-porary chairman, under above stated regulations.3.  "Central District"  comprising the churchschools at 
 Heber, Provo, Springville, Nephi, and Fillmore, with Bro. B. Cluffas chairman. This district has already permanently organized,and holds its first regular session, Saturday Nov. 8, at Provo.4. "Salt Lake District", comprising the L.D.S. College, 18 Ward,14 Ward, and Central Seminaries, Davis Stake Academy, andKaysville Seminary. This district is also permanently organizedwith Bro. J E. Talmage as Chairman. First session was held atthe College, Saturday, Nov. 1. Committees on Program and on Ap-pointments were made.5. "Sanpete District," comprising the churchschools at Hun-tington, Castle Dale, Mt. Pleasant, Ephraim, Manti, and Gunnison,with Bro. Alma Greenwood, as permanent Chairman. Theyare permanently organized, meet monthly at Ephraim or Manti alternately, and their Program is also arranged.6. "Mountain District" comprising the churchschools atRichfield, Fremont, and Panguitch, with Bro. A. R. Cutler astemporary chairman. No report as yet.7. "Southern District" comprising the churchschools in Beaver,Parowan, Cedar, and St. George, with Bro. M. H. Dalley as tempo-rary chairman. They will meet next week to effect a perma-nent organization.8. "Arizona District" comprising the churchschools atSt. Johns, St. Joseph, and Snowflake, with Bro. J. W. Brown astemporary Chairman. No report as yet.In consequence of the very scattered condition of someof those "Districts", as for instance of Idaho and Arizona 
 continued.I have suggested to them to meet perhaps only once a year fora whole week or so, when I should endeaver to meet with thembut that they should fill "written appointments" from time totime. Other "Districts" like the "Mountain District", No. 6.might meet quarterly, but the rest will probably meet monthly.I have suggested to them all that, in making up their programs,they should keep in mind the practice in writing Essays, deliver-ing Discourses and Lectures, Practical Exercises in Objectlessons,Classdrills, Demonstrations on different Methods, Questions and[An]swers, and Reports of their respective schools, and Critics.It has also been suggested that some kind of an organ of communication in regard to the doings of these various "Dis-trict Conventions" for the benefit of all under my editorshipbe selected, and the "Deseret News", the "Juvenile Instructor",and the "Contributor" have been named in this connection.I should be grateful to recieve your instruction on thispoint.In conformity with my calendar of travel through the IdahoDistrict, Coalville, and Heber back to Provo, from Nov. 12 toDec. 132, as submitted to you through Bro. Reynolds, I shallbe at Salt Lake City, Wednesday, Nov. 12, and should be glad, ifPres. Thos Ricks could wait for me until then, so that I could 
 go with him Thursday morning directly to Rexburg, as per ap-pointment. Bro. Ricks will be at Salt Lake next Saturday I under-stand.Pres. A. O. Smoot has informed me that a new Board ofTrustees of the B. Y. Academy has been formed and that I ama member of that Board. All the heirs of the B. Y. Estate havetransferred their claims upon this Board (two excepted), and thenew Board is to meet next Tuesday, Nov. 11. at 10 A.M. to de-liberate upon the feasibility of disposing of real estate be-longing to the Academy, for the purpose of raising meanswherewith the erect the Academy building at the north-end of Provo.Begging your pardon for this lengthy but necessaryreport I remainYour brother in the Gospel,Karl G.

 Provo City, July 1st [189]3President Wilford Woodruff.Dear BrotherBro. Geo. Reynolds' letter of yesterday, enclosing Elder B. Cluff's of the day previous, has been taken into careful consideration.In connection with the subject in hand I enclose Bro. Cluff's letter to me the wording of which seem to convey to me a some-what different shade of meaning from the one contained in the letter to you.  While in the letter to you besides the churchschool education in general, particular stress is laid upon the normal training in the Brigham Young Academy, in the letter to me the "advantages of the Acad-emy" without quedifiation are only mentioned.When we remember the special efforts which the First Presidency is now making through circular letters to all the Stakes of Zion in instructing them to send eligible young people to Provo for normal training in Sunday SchoolWork, M. I.

 Provo, December 10.  [189]2President Wilford Woodruff.Dear Brother,In conformity with the approved program, I left for the first circuit of the present schoolyear for Price station on the D. R. G. Ry, Oct 17, where I was received by a convey-ance from Huntington and taken to the latter place the same afternoon. Pres. Larsen, of Emery Stake, having made the necessary appointments for my labors in his stake,I had to leave for Castle Dale early the next morning, in order to be there at the opening exercises at the Academy.The Principal, Bro. Alexander Jameson, is an earnest workeralthough in some branches somewhat below the average qualifications, but diligently endeavoring to make up his deficiencies. Unfortunately the payment of his salary is very irregular on account of the financial condition of the Academy, and he is obliged to own a little store besides for the support of his family. This is in-jurious to the influence of the Academy, and at the end of the present acad. year other arrangements in this regard must be made.  In a conjoined meeting of the Religionclass Instructors, Sunday School, and M. I. Association Officers, I took occasion to refer 
 credit to their intellectual and spiritual advancement from our churchschools—it seems to me that the Lord is pleased with the educational state of affairs in Zion thus far, and if necessity for further efforts should arise, He would make it known to you in His own way.  To send out teachers from one single institution exclusively might have a tendency to arouse jealousy in others and to break upthat harmony of labor to a common end without which the Spirit of the Gospel cannot be enjoyed.In regard to the Church School Convention and ex-amination of teachers in Arizona, I shall notify all par-ties concerned, that all these exercises will commence the day after the closing of the conjoined conference, and continue the balance of the week.  Please to let me know the date of the conjoined conference.With the daily prayers for your full recovery, I re-main,Your brother in the Gospel,Karl G. Maeser

Alonzo Wall, is a faithful and de-voted teacher, but as the Seminary is running only 12 1/2 terms in the year, he also is obliged to support him-self and family with outside labor, mostly farming. This Seminary is in a far better condition, in attendance as well as in general standing than the Stake Academy.The members of the Local Board are interested in their school and are making great efforts to run the school the full year in future. Bro. Jameson as well as Bro. Wall held their District Convention, attended by many Sunday School Teachers, mostly, and the Religion Classes throughout the Stake are reported in good working order.Uintah Stake.Left Huntington Thursday, Oct. 20, for Price station where I was met by Bro.

He is a very efficient young man both spiritually and intellectually, and bids fair to build up the educational interest in that part of the count4y to high standard. The school is filled already to its utmost capacity, and an Assistant will have to be engaged, which will necessity an enlargement of the building. The Board owns the house. Size of building 36 x 21. x 13. Cost $1000. Dedicated January 15. 1892.The Academy had been running only 5 weeks, and the Principal is busily engaged to get his plans into shape, home Religion classes had not yet been organized, but the Sunday Schools, and M.

 Provo City, January 2nd [189]3President Wilford WoodruffDear Brother,The letter from the First Presidency, dated Dec. 31st 1892,announcing my appointment as one of the trustees of the U-niversity of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints, hasjust been received.

Smith was waiting for me to take me at once to Snowflake, where we arrived about midnight. The Saints at Snowflake where disappointed by my not arriving for their Sunday meetings. This disappoint-ment was caused by the bad and horrible roadbetween Vernal and Price, compelling us to travel three days instead of two, thus disarranging my program by one day. Bro. Edward M Webb, the Principalof the Academy, had not yet commenced his labors to my great regret. It appears that Bro. Webb had concluded to quit teaching altogether and that only a short time ago the Board succeeded in inducing him to resume his labors. Bro. Webb is a fine teacher but thoroughly discouraged for financial reasons, having a large family to support. Meetings for S. S. Teachers, M. I. A. Officers, Primary teachers, & Religionclass In-structors in the forenoon, for the Public in the af-ternoon, and Conjoined Meeting of the M. I.

 Provo. May 27thPresident Wilford Woodruff.Dear Brother,In conformity with the arranged program for the fifthCouncil of which notice had been given to the respective StakePresidents and Principals, I arrived at Logan, Tuesday, April 19;and accordinally received and hospitably entertained byProf. J. H. Paul, Principal of the B.Y. College. Wednesday,April was spent exclusively in attending the classes exercises at theB.Y. College. It is with much satisfaction that I can report thefine condition of this College in regard to intellectual pro-gress as well as to spiritual standing and general disciplinealthough it must be stated that it has been somewhathard at first for Prof. Paul to partake of the spirit of oureducational system; in as much as ^during^ the first few monthsof his labors at the College his usefulness was greatly im-paired by his vigorous participation in the struggles ofthe political drama and his theological instructions beingfixed too much upon the [illegible] philosphies of the age,both of which mistakes Bro. Paul is mainly striving toovercome. It is to be regretted that by the time this efficientteacher, promising^es^ to become such a valuable co-laborerof ours, willing will leave the educational profession and 
 all the branches ofThis grade, including Kindergartenwork, having[ rensined ]her Normal training and been practical teacher for yearsin Holland:  I addressed the students of the College inthe morning of Thursday, April 27; and left for Franklin,Idaho, in the afternoon.  A meeting of the Seminary Boardwas held at the Tithing office at 4 P.M., and the sameinstructions were discussed and unanimnously adoptedthat had been given at all the Boardmeetings during theprevious Circuits.  I regretted exceedingly that the Seminaryhad closed, and the Principal, Bro. Thomas A. Condie, had leftfor his home in Morgan City, taking all the records with himin order to straighten them up before June 30.  Bro. Condiehas written to me once, promising to have them returned [par-]ly made out before June 30.  I have also instructed Bro. JosephG. Nelson, Principal of the Oneida Stake Academy, at Pres-ton, to examine those Records after their arrival, and reportto me their condition.  It appears from the statements by mem-bers of the Board that Bro. Condie has not given entire satis-faction, having been any deficient in discipline.  This SeminaryBoard deserves much credit for their energy in providinga handsome building tolerable well furnished, andthey are determined to keep in the lead in educationalmatters at Franklin, although there is a chance now inIdaho to get reliable trustees and teachers for thedistrictschools. 
 trade his fine talents to law and politics in which pursuitshe expects to find more adequate renumeration.  The College is sustaining a serious loss by the resignation of Bro. Kerr,who has accepted a call as Profesor of Mathematics at theUniversity of Utah, his place is to be filled by Bro. Gowansfrom the B.Y. Academy of Provo.  Prof. Paul is ably sustainedby his Faculty, among whom Bros. Todd and Apperly de-serve especial montion as the chief standard bearers of thespirit of the Latterday Work in the College. A very pleasingfeature of the B.Y. College is the Preparatory Dept. in chargeof Sister Hoving, an experienced Lady and Primary Teacher,and fervant Latterday Saint.  Like many other youngtalented, but ambitious teachers, Prof. Paul was inclinedto build up higher classes for scientific and literarypursuits to the neglect of the foundamental branchesof education. The objection to such a course does not liemerely in the fact that only comparatively for are preparedto take such courses and the expenses of maintening themwould amount in some instances from $150 to $200for each student per annum, but that such studiesrequire the most eficient teachers of the Faculty, whohave to donate their whole time to the instruction ofperhaps 10 to 19 students in all, while their labors aretaken away from about 200 who are just as muchentitled to the benefits of their instructions. In follow-ing up this original inclinations, Prof. Paul intendedyou to dismiss Mrs. Hoving with her whole departmentof from 60 to 75 children in order to make room for 
 Provo, March 29th [189]2President Wilford Woodruff.Dear Brother,In conformity with the program for my fourth circuit, sub-mitted to Bro. G. Reynolds, on March 18th, I started for Ogden the same day and met with the Board of Education of WeberStake at 5 P.M;. ^On the following day, I^ visited the Sunday school of the Second Ward,addressed the public meeting in the afternoon, and the meetingof the Fifth Ward in the evening, on all of which occasionsthe proper training of the youth and the principles ofour educational system furnished me the texts. Monday,March 21, attended the Academy the whole day, met againwith the Stake Board after close of school, and ^by request^ gave a lec-ture to the Seventies in the evening. It is gratifying to reportthat the members of the Weber Stake Board of Educationare all active workers in the cause, and under their ju-dicious management that Academy is forging its wayto the frontrank among our educational institutions. Imade them acquainted with the requirements which,according to the General Circular No. 8, soon to be pub-lished, would constitute a real Academy in our Church-School Organization. They are determined to obtain teach-ers of the required qualifications and grades for next 
 2.Oneida Stake Academy.Having arrived at Preston in the morning of Thursday, April 27.I had the privilege of attending all the exercises of the Stake Academyduring the day.  As the Principal, Bro. Jos. G. Nelson had beenengaged a greater portion of the academic year with princconcerns in order to establish himself permanently at Preston,an Assistant Principal in the person of Bro. David Hansonhas been engaged, assisted by Sister Mete Nelson and Neils [E li]Benson, all of whom were found doing faithful and efficientwork.  The records were in excellent order.  Although many ofthe students have to come daily to school large distances,some of them from 5-6 miles in various kinds of consequen-ces, and even the nearest of them have to walk about ahalf a mile through sleet, snow, and wind in wintertimesthe attendance roll shows a degree of functuality andregularity surpassed only in a few of our churchschoolsThe Academy building is nearing its completion, but the classwork has got to be caried on in the basement.  I haveto offer some severe criticism on the unnecessary ex-penditure for ornamental architcture in that buildingand the Board has accepted my suggestions of turningthe two entirely superfluans side entrances into windows 
 our educational aims and purposes. Arriving at Juarez. Wednesday, Nov. 9, about 5 P.M. we were kindly visited by Apostle Teasdale, but have to go at once to the Academy where all the students had been waiting for our arrival to have the privilege of shaking hands with us. There were 67 of them, with Bro. Dennis Harris, as Principal, and two lady-teachers as Assistants. That evening we addressed by appointment a conjoined meeting of the M. I. A. the house being crowded to overflowing. The next day I spent in the school. Bro. Harris has conducted this schoolat his own risk for several years most successfully and desires to have his school fall into line with the wholeChurchschool Organization. Pres. Teasdale organized a Central Board of Organization for the Mexican Mission, and also authorized  Local Boards of Education to be organized for the Academy at Diaz, and the Seminary at Dublan, the first two Boards have sent in their application for recog-nition already, and Dublan will soon follow.There was another crowded meeting at Juarez, that Wednesday^Thursday^ evening, and the following day, Thursday ^Friday^ morning, we started on our return trip to 
 more academic classes composed of 3 or 4 students each.In my representation of the case to the College Board of Trustees,Prof. Paul was told that the Trustees would find the roomsfor Sister Hoving and her pupils, as ^for as^ many as she could get.As Prof. Paul has practically demonstrated his earnest desire tofall into line with our educational system we fast so he can,It would be unfair to criticise too closely the deficiencies inthe Records to be kept in every one of our churchschools ac-cording to Gen. Circ. No. 7, page 17, the more so as his pre-decessor, Prof. Tanner has not left them in as complete acondition as they should be. I have Bro. Paul's promiseto have them in order by most academic years.  Thursday,April 20, I met with the Trustees of the College, to which meeting by was attended by my, request by President Orson Smithand his counsellors. The organization of a Stake Boardof Education was discussed and effected. The interview wasone exceedingly pleasant one and will probably be practive-tive of much good in the educational interest of thatStake. I had the pleasure of adressing that same evening perounded meeting of studented and patrons of the B.Y. Collegein the aims and spirit of our educational system.By special invitation of Apostle Moses Thatcher I par- 
 year. The Faculty consists of the Principal, three male,and two lady-teachers. Neither of the two ladies, however,had undertaken thus far to qualify herself for the spe-cial instructions enjoined to be given in our churchSchools by lady-teachers, according to Gen. Circ. No. 7, page 18. The Board promised me that this featureshould find ample recognition with the begin-ning of next academic year. This Academy has hadabout 200 students registered during this year, but owingto the late opening will have been in session only 27weeks iat the end of this academic year. The newAcademy-building, although not yet quite finished, iswell of arranged for educational purposes, reflectingmuch credit upon the energy and good judgementof the Board. The Principal and Teachers areearnest workers, and are anxious to fully qualifyfor their work according to instructions in Gen. Circ.No. 7, pages 5-12.Box Elder Stake Academy.According to appointment, I arrived at Brigham City,Tuesday, March 22nd, at 1.30 P.M. and met withPresident R. Clawson, and another member of theBoard, and the Principal, there being no Quorumpresent. The Stake Academy had closed for theyear at the end of the third term, as it was sta-ted to me by President Clawson, on account of toosmall attendance. I called the attention of the bretherento the instructions given on the subject in Gen. Circ. No. 7, 
 them not only saving several hundred hollars of expen-diture, but also obtaining greater comfort to teachers andstudents.  The great hall will be a magnifcent and receptionhall, but as educational auditorium.  There was a Boardmeeting in the afternoon with full attendance, and themembers felt unanimiuously to carry out the instructiongiven in behalf of the General Board.  The Faculty meetingwas also attended by Pres. Parkinson.  The Principalship ofthis Academy is [illegible ] of particular [illegible ]just now, in as much as Bis. G. Nelson, will have [illegible 3 words ]this year his nomination for his Standing Certificate or finish his Nor-mal course first.

To my surprise Iwas in formed that the school had discontinued and the new Seminary building being rent to theDistrict School Trustees. I wrote an explanatory letterto President Parkinson in regard to the mode ofprocedure in such cases and obtained the promiseof proper observance of our regulations for the future.Oneida Stake Academy.After having participated in the meetings of the OneidaStake Conference at Franklin during Sunday and Monday, April 23 & 24, where opportunities two had beengiven me to urge upon the people the necessity oftrue education, I left in company with Pres.

The meeting was crowded to overflowing and addressed by Pres. J. F. Smith, ApostleThatcher and Lyman, and myself. The Stake Academyhad just closed its session, the previous Friday. 
 St. Joseph Stake.I left Deming the same evening for Borine Station at the Southern Pacific Ry, arriving there near midnight and took the stage for Thatcher the next morning, arriving there about 4 P.M. and was very hospitably received by Pres. Christopher Layton. That day, Friday, attended the Academy fore= and afternoon. The Principal, Bro.Geo. Cluff, is assisted by Mrs. Birdno, his sister. There is some splendid work done by those two in that Academy, although is not very largely attended just now, having recieved quite a backset during the recent politicalcampaigne, the Principal having been away on an sta-tioneering tour through Arizona for four weeks. Bro.Cluff is earnestly endeavoring to fill up his scatteredranks. In a Boardmeeting held on Saturday, manyresolutions for the successful carrying on of theAcademy and of the Religion classes were adoptiveand Pres. Layton manifested a deep interest in the matter. A meeting of the conjoined M. I. A.and Sunday School Officers concluded Saturday'sproceedings. The following Sunday was spentat Pima filling three appointments as usual. 
 pages 4-5, that such a step should not be taken withoutconsulting the General Superintendent, who is held res-ponsible to the General Board for his permission.In this connection I feel it my duty to report, thatmany of our Stake and Local Boards seem to be tooin different as yet to the instructions given by the GeneralBoard from time to time, and I should suggest, thatrepeated carelessness of this kind should not be leftunnoticed in any appropriation for such a schoolthe following year, or some other impressive remin-der be adopted, in order to emphasize in such cases,the injunctions of the General Board. This complaintrefers also to the Church School Papers, published byorder of the General Board. Bro. A. Vance, the Principalof the Box Elder S. Academy is a faithful and efficientworker, and he will probably ^make^ his permanent homeat Brigham City, which will prove of great advantageto our educational interests in that Stake.Davis Stake Academy.Wednesday, March 23rd, being unexpectedly at my dis-posal, the Box Elder Stake Academy, having closedits session, I h a filled out the day by going to Farming- 
 3.to address a public meeting by appointment in the L.D.S.Meetinghouse, the congregation being about one half outriders,the building was crowded.  The next morning at 3 o'clock I leftby Oregan Short Line Ry. for [Minnidoke], where I was takenby Bro. Prim to Albion, Cassin Co. to hold a meeting there inthe evening in the Wardmeetinghouse.  Pres. Haight havingjoined me at Albion, we left for Oakley in the morning ofTuesday, May 2nd, where I had also to address a publicmeeting in the evening.Cassin Stake AcademyWednesday, May 3rd, was devoted to visiting the Stake Academyin the forenoon.  The Principal, Bro. A. F. O. Nielson, is a young manof much promise, and has done very faithful labors for threeyears in that Academy. He will take charge the coming schoolyear of the Tooele Stake Academy at Grantsville.  The StakeSuperintendent of Education of Idaho, has procured forBro. Nielson, although entirely unsolicited, a [Lifedipls]of the First Grade, to teach in any educational institutionin the Stake of Idaho, "in appreciation of his ability andefficient labors as an educator."  On this account I amsomewhat arry that Bro. Nielsonleaves that state, as hisremaining there would have given considerable prestige 
 Some of the specimens of maps drawn by several studentswere yet on exhibition around the walls and were the bestever produced of the Land in any of our churchschools. Bro.Joseph G. Nelson, Principal, assisted Miss Mattie Nelson, Pres.Dept. & Ladies Week, and by Bro. John S. Bingham, Pres. Dept. Bro.Nelson has served his second year as Principal and expects to settle permanently at Preston, finishing his Normal Courseas the B.Y. College in Logan next year, but retaining hisPrincipalships at Preston with Bro. Bingham as Deputy.This special arrangement was proposed by me and acceptedby the Oneida S. Board, in conformity with a similararrangement for next year at the Sanpete S. AcademyThe records of the Oneida S. Academy are in perfect order.Malad Stake Academy.Tuesday, April 26, I arrived at West Portage as per appointmentand was hospitably received by Pres. Hoskins, with whom Iattended the following day a meeting of the Stake Boardof Malad and in the evening a public meeting Samaria in the educational interest. The former Sem-inary at Samaria has been discontinued for the presentacademic year and its Principal, joined the StakeAcademy at Malad as Assistant Teacher, by mutual 
 Diaz stopping at Dublan a few hours to address a meeting of the Saints there, who unanimously en-dorsed the motion recommendation of the Central Board to have their school recognized as achurchschool Seminary, with Bro. Anson Call as Principal. The latter will also apply for a License under the usual registrations, as also Bro. Harris, his Assistants, and the lady-teachersat Diaz. We arrived at Diaz, Saturday, Nov. 12, about 3 P. M. just in time to attend the meeting of the Primary.There was also a very crowded meeting of the M.I.A.in the evening. The following Sunday, was occupied with attending the usual three meetings, at which the Saints fully endorsed the appointment of a Local Board for the Academy, and of Bp.W. D. Johnson of Superintendent of the ReligionClasses throughout the Mexican Mission.A meeting of the Local Board was held bet-ween the afternoon and evening meetings.Monday, Nov. 14, we started on our return-trip to Deming where we arrived Wednesday, Nov. 16, about 2 P. M. My most cordial thanks are due to Apostle Teasdale, Bp. Johnson and the Saints throughout the Mexican Mission,for the great hospitality shown me; and for the deep interest they have manifested in our edu-cational movement. 
 ton with the early train for the purpose of visiting theDavis Stake Academy. I found Bro. Woodbury, thePrincipal, and Miss Woodruff, his Assistant, con-ducting an Intermediate and a Preparatory Depart-ment, comprising 38 students in all, a remnantof about 85, attend that attended during the winter.There is good work done by these two teachers, althoughBro. Woodbury, according to his own statement, islacking as yet somewhat in discipline. I havegiven him some pointers which, in connectionwith the instructions he will get in the comingNormal Summer School, may in able himin future to overcome this deficiency. My comingnot having been previously known, was not at-tended by any Boardmeeting, but a public meetingin the evening, enabled me to address a large au-dience on the subject of our Church Schools andReligion-Classes.Morgan Stake Academy.Tuesday, March 24th, found out at Morgan City, whereI spent the evening in conversation with Bro. Geo. JRamsey, the Principal of the Stake Academy, in orderto get posted in regard to the educational conditionof that Stake. The attendance at the school has sunkdown from 45 to 11, and the Principal reports thatthe apathy among the people and of some of the 
 agreement between the Stake and the Local Board Tuesday,April the 26th, spent the whole day in attending the musical atthe Stake Academy, conducted by the Principal alone. Hisschool having diminished very much to a great extent,The Assistant Teacher has taken to his farming and sayinghis last term, leading the Principal alone to conduct allthe class of the 3 4 & 5 Readergrades. Bro. Geo Cole is afaithful worker and is improving professionally ina very satisfactory manner. This school is on a solidfoundation. The Board contemplates to enlarge theaccommendations for the school by proposing aportion of their yet unfinished tabernacle next sum-mer. These improvements can be made at a cour-parstively small expence.  There is yet a very largeamount of local jealousy between Portage and Ma-lad as to the permanent location of the Stake Acad-amy, which is greatly to the disadvantage of theinstututions.  The sooner the General Board wouldgive instructions to have this question definitelysettled the better it would be for the educationalinterest of that Stake. Public meetings at Malad andPortage in the evenings of the Wednesday ^Tuesday^ and ThursdayApril 26 & 28, h in the interest of our churchschoolmovement, have not been, I trust, without somebeneficial results.Cassia Stake Academy.Arriving at Oakley, via Collinston, Pocatello, and Minersvillein the afternoon of Saturday, April 30, where Pres. extendedto me the hospitalities of his home during the time of 
 Maricopa Stake.Monday, Nov. 21, I started for Maricopa, via BowieStation and the Southern Pacific, arriving at Tempe,Wednesday, Nov. 24, where I was received by Pres. Chs. I.Robson, who took me to Mesa City. There was ameeting appointed the same morning, which waslargly attended by the Saints and many outsiders.Thanksgiving Day brought on two more mee-tings, and the following Friday was spent inthe new Academy. Bro. Robert H. Smith, for-merly of Diaz, is the Principal.  Although Bro.Smith was not familiar with our system, andI had some apprehension before meeting him,I must confess that he has surpassed by far myexpectations, both spiritually and intellectually.I had to give him some pointers for his guidancein future, of course, but he is doing good workand carries a good influence with him.He is very humble, teachable, and devoted tohis work. Saturday was a meeting of the StakeBoard. The three meetings on Sunday kept ongrowing in attendance, that I was told that inthe evening meeting there had been as large acongregation outside on the sidewalk and atthe windows as there was inside. The Saints here aswell as in the Mexican Mission and in Uintah seemto be spiritually hungry. 
 leading men is very discouraging, although I found duringmy visit that all are speaking in the highest terms ofthe labors of Bro. Ramsey. Bro. Ramsey is assisted part-ly by one of his lady-students as a tutor, and his ownclasswork, general management and influence is to becommented very highly. At the Board meeting in theafternoon ^of Friday, March 25,^ the general indifference of the people wasmade conspicuous by the report of the Treasurer, thateven leading men were owing yet their tuition for the1. 2. 3. & 4th year. I suggested to the Board the proprietyof carrying on that part of their Academy work uponstrict business principles in future, and that the Treasurerin his Annual Financial Statement to the GeneralBoard on July 15% should not only state the amountof unpaid tuition but also the number of parties among ^from^whom that indebtedness was due, for it might perhapsoccur to the General Board to ask for the names.That shot will sound secure the payment of the greater portionof the amount, as some leading men ^I dared say^ would sooner paytwice the amount then have their names broughtbefore the General Board, in such a way. As it is verydoubtful if the Stake Board will secure the Courthouse at 
 my stay. The great Fastmeeting the next day was spent with the rest of the Saints in a four hours' meeting under the in-fluence of the Spirit of God in a very marked degree, when Ialso found time to perform the duties of my mission.A very pleasant meeting of the Stake Board was held inthe afternoon and evening, after which an adjournmentwas taken to attend a public meeting especially arranged forme. The subject of Religion-Classes formed the chief topicof my remarks. Monday, May 2nd was spent in the Academy.Here the Principal Bro. A. F. O. Nielson conducted the PrimaryDept. inclusive of III & IV Readers alone; the larger students,constituting the Intermediate Grade, having had to quitfor the 11 term on account of farm work. Outside ofthe B. Y. Academy and the B. Y. College I have seen nowhere among our churchschools such splendid primarywork as there is being done by Bro. Nielson. Althoughthe new Academy building is not quite finished, it issufficiently so that both stories can be used by the Ac-ademy to advantage. That small Stake, thinly popu-lated, composed mostly of non settlers struggling withthe arid soil for a living, calls forth my admirationfor their faith and united energy to make their Academy 
 Left Maricopa ^Mesa City^ Monday, Nov. 28, via Phoenix, where I had the pleasure of an hour's conversation with Governor Zulick, who appeared to be warm friend to our people. I arrived at Oakland, Thursday, NovDec. 1st, at 10 P. M. being cordially received by Bro. John L. Dalton, at 16th Str. Station. The next day was spent in visiting Saints in Oakland and San Francisco, and taking a drive to the Cliffhouse in -the midst of a trenching rain. Saturday more visits and some writing. Sunday two meetings to smallcongregations with some strangers. Bro. Dalton is much handicapped in his movements to hunt upsome old members of the church in Las Angeles,Sacramento, and other places for want of funds.I started for home, Monday, Decr. 5, and arrivedTuesday night.Summary.During this circuit I attended 7 Boardmeetings, 29Public Meetings, visited 8 churchschools, and organized several educational Boards, being about from Oct. 17 to Dec. 6, being 50 days in all.With kind regards,Karl G.

 Morgan City for their Academy, ^next acad. year^, it is a matter of veryserious concern what to do in case of such a dis-appointment, the more so, as Bro. Ramsey wouldbe willing to make his stay permanent one,if the people should desire it so. Otherwise, Bro.Ramsey would be a valuable acquisition to anyoneof our churchschools.Summit Stake Academy.Having been previously informed by Pres. W. W. Cluff,that the Summit Stake Academy had closed at theend of the third term with a "handsome attendanceand a very creditable examination", I know that Ishould not have the privilege of visiting the school,but hoped to meet with the Board and withthe Principal, and then got some idea of thecondition of affairs and of the work done. Onmy arrival at Coalville, Saturday, March 26, at 6 P.M.I found that the Principal, Bro. Geo. Middleton, hadleft for his home in the South, and that therecould be no Boardmeeting on account of theabsence of most of the members. Bro. Middletonis going to withdraw from the educational fieldas he wants to go east in the fall to study Medicine.I am sorry for this unceremonious way of quittinga labor which that young man has performedto the benefit of his pupils and much credit to himself.

He desires to pur-sue his studies for qualifying himself in highergrades I shall be crowded for Principals next year, asseveral others have given notice to quit for the samereason, and the sufficient supply of qualifiedpersons for such positions becomes excedinglydoubtful.Bannock Stake Academy.Tuesday, May 3rd found me again on the road in orderto reach Rexburg via Minedoka, Pocatello, and MarketLake, arriving at my destination Wednesday afternoon,May 4th. President Ricks having met me at Market Lake,and made me comfortable at his house at Rexburg.Thursday, May 5th I spent in visiting the Stake Academy, con-ducted by Bro. Chas N. Watkins, as Principal, and Sister Barnes, Assistant. The school has registered for thisII Term about 75 students, all the way from the [Chartclass]to the V Readergrade, although of the latter are only afew left, the rest had to quit on account of farming.Bro. Watkins has infused new life into the educa-tional affairs, and so ably assisted by Sister BarnesThe great drawback for the further development ofthis Stake Academy is the schedule refusal of all the Wards of at the southside of the river to supportthe Academy in any way either by sending studentsor with means. This feeling extends to the public meetingand to Quarterly Conferences. When holding meetingsby appointment at Lewisville and Eagle Rock, which 
 President W. W. Cluff posted me, however, as far as possiblewit in regard to the condition of the school, laid before meall the Records of the Academy, to be kept accordingto Gen. Circ. No. 7, page 17, all of which I found ingood order, and stated to me the difficulties withwhich their Academy had to wrestle from the beginning,having had to change its locality four times alreadysince its organization. There is, however, a prospectof securing either one of two fine houses, well suitedfor schoolpurposes at comparatively low figures, ifthey could hope for some assistance in that direction.As in all the other Stakes visited during this fourthcircuit, the Religion-classes in Summit Stake havebeen sadly neglected in some Wards, in consequence ofwhich I arranged with Pres. Cluff to attend their QuarterlyConference. May 11, 12, & 13, on my return from Idaho,for the purpose of explaining to the Bishops that na-ture and mode of operation of this educational feature.Similar arrangements were made in Ogden andBrigham City.

In conformity, therefore, with my appro[v]ed pro-gram I started on my circuit around the churchschoolsof southern Utah, Saturday, October 21st to Nephi.President Paxman, having to attend court at Provo thatsame day, had left all necessary instructions with theStake Academy Principal, Justin Call, with whom Ispent the afternoon in examining the records of theAcademy and getting posted in regard to the educa-tional conditions of that Stake. By special invitationof Pres. Paxman I had the privilege of attending andaddressing the beautiful Prayercircle, at Nephi, onSunday morning, followed by a visit to the Sunday school 
 evening. Having experienced several chills duringthe day, Pres. Cluff strongly protested against my star-ting to Heber City, via Park the next morning, de-claring that the heavy storms then raging in themountains could not be endured by me inthe situation I was in, and so I had to cancelmy appointment for Wasatch Stake Academy,telephoning to Pres. Abraham Hatch the situa-tion, and returned home, Monday, March 28th, endeavoring to head off any relapse in toInfluence, so that I might be ready forConference.With kind regards,Your brother in the Gospel,Karl G.

 places at the southside of the river, I took occasionto talk privately with the respective Bishops on the subject,and was surprised at the intensity of the feeling existing inthat portion of the Stake. The Bishops declare that it is theunanamimous feeling of the Saints on the south side of theriver, that they are suffering for want of spiritual nourish-ment on account of the geographical location of theirsection of the Stake, and that there be no hope for them untilthey get organized into a Stake for themselves. Althoughthis feature does not belong to my department for discusion,I have to refer to it as it greatly impedes the progress ofthe educational work.  The predecesosr of Bro. Watkinshaving not been very exact in keeping the records re-quired in our schools, Bro. Watkins has great difficultyin straightening up his books, but hopes to have themall in order before opening of the next schoolseason.[7;] The reason of above alluded to a quorum of the Stake Boardcould not be obtained and some informal conversation bet-ween the five members present and myself have in the edu-cational interest had to take its place. Several meetingswith the teachers during Friday and Saturday resultedin arriving at a mutual understanding in regard to 
 This is by far the best organized and conducted Sundayschoolwhich it has been my privilege ever to visit. At the mee-ting of all the Instructors after the close of the school,I explained, by request of Pres. Paxman, the harmony ofaim and methods existing between ^the^ SundayschoolWork and the Religion Class Movement, on thebasis of the Circularletter on the subject, dated Sept. 12.A discourse in the afternoon meeting, and a lectureto the conjoined M. I. Association in the eveningconcluded my labors for that day.Juab Stake AcademyAccording to the suggestion of Pres. Geo. Q. Cannon, tohave our churchschools conducted on the pro rata planduring the present academic year, Bro. Justin D. Call,and his assistant, Miss Mattie Nelson, have assumedall the financial responsibilities of the school, exceptthe fuel, and have met also in this regard withunforeseen success.  The Academy is paying itsway very satisfactorily, the attendance being largeand constantly increasing.  In the Primary Depart-ment, comprising pupils from the First to theFourth Grade, inclusive, all seats were taken. ThisAcademy is rapidly passing to the front among ourchurchschools, and the prospect  is, that the StakeBoard will be under the neccessity of enlargingthe premises, with the disappearance of thefinancial stringency just now prevailing everywhere.

D. S. Seminary at Montpelier.After having filled my appointments made for me byPres. Ricks at Lewisville and Eagle Rock, I leftthe latter place Tuesday, May 10th with the midnight-train and reached Montpelier in the afternoon, Wed-nesday May 11th. The Seminary here has been in chargeof Bro. Martin Winters and his sister Mary, both ofwhom are faithful young people, but notyet beinggraduates, their efficiancy is rather limited in some respects. It was the best, however, that could bedone under the circumstances.  They had to runthe Seminary of their now financial risk, but filledthe house with about 75 pupils this winter. Bp:Rick and his Associates have succeeded finallyto obtain full possession of the grounds andbuilding and contemplatingd to conduct the schoolthe coming academic year in proper shape. We hadvery pleasant meeting of the Local Board theSeminary. The Seminary had closed, and I foundsome of the Records in satisfactory condition, and farto balance missing instructed Bos. Winters, how to keepthem, which he promised me to do. 
 At the meeting of the Stake Board after schoolhours, theestablishment of Religion-Classes on the basis of the Cir-cularletter, was decided upon, and Bro. J. D. Call appoin-ted as Stake Superintendent. The Recordbook of this StakeBoard of Education shows are very punctual attendanceof all the members, regular meetings, and comprehensionof the importance of their mission. By previous ap-pointment I attended and addressed with Pres. Paxmana meeting at Mona, and the following evening atLeban, in the interest of the rising generation and star-ted for Milford, Wednesday, Oct. 25th arriving at Beaveron the day following, where I had the privilege of ad-dressing a large meeting in the Second Ward meeting-house the same evening on the usual topics of mymission.Parowan Stake.Friday, Oct. 27, I left for Paragoonah being met at BuckhornSprings by a conveyance from the former place, as I hadto address the people there in the evening by appointmentfrom Pres.

 Provo, October 5, [189]3President Wilford Woodruff.Dear Brother,In consequence of the great diversity in the nomenclatureof Grades, Departments, and Classes, in many of our church-schools, a great confusion in this respect had arisen, ma-king an estimate of their comparative standing andlabors on my part and a subsequent correct reportto the General Board almost impossible. To obviate thisdifficulty for the future, Church School Papers, No. 20, Juv.Instr. April 15, last, recommended this subject with severalothers to the consideration of all churchschool teachers, pre-paratory to discussion at our Annual Convention.The Annual Convention met at the Brigham YoungAcademy, Provo, August 14, at 11 A.M. The proceedingsof that Convention are reported in the Church School Papers,No. 23, Juv. Instr. Sept. 1st. After much discussion of theabove stated point, it was decided to refer it to the Boardof Examiners for the formulation of a mode of nomen-clature, to be complied with by all our churchschools,as soon that mode of nomenclature should haveobtained the sanction of the General Board ofEducation.

Miles is an earnest worker,his only fault is a lack of gentleness in his dealings with thepupils. Being exceedingly sensitive himself it is strange howhe can be so inconsiderate sometimes with the feelings ofothers. Saturday, May 14th, a meeting of the Stake Board washeld at which the numbers manifested unanimously thedetermination to develop the interests of the Academy andReligion-Classes throughout the Stake.

This subject I have followedup on many other occasions since then.  Passing throughParowan the following day, I arrived at Cedarin the evening, attended Sunday School in themorning of the Sunday, afternoon and eveningmee-tings.  The necessity of a Normaltraining for SundaySchool workers was very apparent in Cedar City.An extenuating circumstances in regard to the back-ward condition of their Sunday schools is the pe-culiar occupation of the majority of the people inthat region of country viz: The dairy business is ta-king young and old during a great portion ofthe year into the mountains, thus braking upday-, church-, and Sundayschools; the youngpeople returning late in the fall educationallydemoralised, and requiring much time to getthem back again into the spirit for studying any-thing.The Parowan Stake Academyat Cedar City, is conducted by Bro.

I attended Sunday School aQuorum Meeting, and a ^two^ Public Meetings, at all of which oc-casion I had to bear my testimony to the inspired me natureof an educational work. Tuesday, May 17, I left for Randolph, where I arrived in the evening, and followedan appointment made for me that same evening toaddress the people in behalf ofThe Rich County Academy.This institution in reality working but a Seminary, and was per-mitted by the General Board with the consent of the BearLake Stake Board to assume the title of "Rich CountyAcademy in view of its isolated geographical position,similar to that at Elba, Cassia Stake, where now an Academy or churchschools building is in progress oferection. The Randolph Churchschool has thus farbeen permitted to occupy the upperom of the Court-house, but doubts are entertained by the LocalBoard in regard to the occupancy the coming school-year, which makes the erection of are own school-building a necessity sooner or later.  Bro. Olaf Larsen,the Principal informed me that the school had closedthe previous Friday, and that he himself desired toresign. Wednesday a Boardmeeting was held in theafternoon at Woodruff, at which all the membersindicated their appreciation of Bro. Larsen's labors with 
 records and the spiritual, intellectual, and dis-ciplinary condition.  The Board hopes, that Bro. Warnermay make his permanent home in Cedar.  The atten-dance in the Intermediate Department was quite lowas yet but a large increase was expected at the begin-ning of the next term. Pres. U. T. Jones has thus farcarried a great part of the financial responsibilitiesof the Board on his own shoulders, a circumstancewhich I have not failed to remind the people of inmy public addresses there. At the meeting of the StakeBoard after schoolhours. I learned that a Bro. Williamsof Kannab, had been appointed Stake Superintendentof Religion-Classes.  I have since communicated withthe new appointee in regard to his duties.

 the hope that he would not resign. Bro. Larsen has takenhis decision under advisement at present. A very crowded mee-ting at Woodruff that night testified to the deep interest whichthe people of that part of the Stake are taking in educationalmatters. I found the Records of theRandolph School in a satisfactory condition. Thursday, May 19th at  o'clock inthe morning I started for Provo via Evanston, Ogden, andSalt Lake, in order to be present at the closing exercises ofThe Brigham Young AcademyFriday, May 20, just 44 years ago the same day that I didgraduate. Since my resignation as Principal of that instu-tion I have deemed it my duty to watch the drift of wants there as closely as time and circumstances would permit. Acknow-ledging to its fullest extent the rapid intellectual progressthat institution is making since its occupation of its [smudge]and well adapted buildings, I look, nevertheless, with seriousapprehension upon the financial condition of the Academyand the gravity of the situation may compel the newPrincipal to curtail to some extent the farreaching shemeswhich he has in contemplation.Some general observations made during this and the previousCircuits of the present schoolyear will best brought forth

A meeting had beenappointed for me here, and was listened to by avery attentive audience, although it appears fromseveral observations that neither Sunday school norM. I.

 Provo City, March 7th [189]3President Wilford Woodruff.Dear Brother,Herewith I submit respectfully the report of my labors in theSecond Circuit, the program of which had been previously ap-proved of by you.The Brigham Young Academy, Provo.After having officially notified the Board of Trustees of this institutionof my intended visit to the Academy, I spent two days, Jan. 10 & 11,in attending the various exercises of the institution, and met withthe Faculty at the regular meeting, Wednesday, Jan. 11, at 7 P.M.This Academy surpasses all other churchschools not only in thenumber of its students (over 900 registered up to date) and ofits regular teachers (23), but also in the complexity of its organiza-tion and in the amount of labor performed there, in consequenceof all of which the influence of that Academy is recognizedthroughout all the Stakes of Zion. Besides the regular de-partments graded according to Gen. Circ. No. 7, pp. 19 to 21, thereare following special organizations: 1. A Kindergarten Classwith about 30 little ones under 6 years of age, with a Normaltraining Class for young ladies to prepare themselves for thatparticular feature of education. 2. A polytechnic Classfor training in practical workmanship. There are over 40 
 schoolhours, as the children are then too tired to take much interest, and especially many boys have to gohome to do chores; neither could all the good be ac-complished on Saturdays for the same reasons as re-gards to the boys and many of the larger girls. Itwas therefore, decided to apply to the School Trustee sto close the district schools one hour at least sooner—one day or two in the afternoon, for the purpose ofletting our children have the privilege of going totheir Religion-Classes.  This plan has met withmuch favor everywhere, that it has been adopted thusfar since, in St. George, Parowan, Beaver, Sevier, andSanpete Stakes. The Stake Academy at St. George hashad to suspend operation for this academic year,and Bro. Nephi Savage, the former Principal, has ad-opted a position as teacher in the Districtschools, buthas been appointed as Stake Superintendent of Religion-Classes. The same evening I filled an appointmentin a meeting at Santa Clara. Saturday, Nov. 4, ad-dressed a conjoined meeting of the M. I. Association ofSt. George, visited the next morning the Sundayschools,and addressed the meeting of the Sunday Schools. 
 students waiting to take part, as only about a dozen only areat work just now, on account of lack of facilities. 3. A classfor military and physical drill, constituting a completemilitary organization, fully uniformed and furnished fromCamp Douglas with a complete stand of arms. 4.a class in Physical Culture for young ladies with Normaltraining in that branch of study. 5. A cClasses in Ladies'Work, Plain Sewing, Fancy, and in all other branchesin tht line, fully graded. 6. A class in the Fine Arts,with Painting and Modeling. 7. A Music Department,consisting of three grades in Instrumental Music,and in a "Choral Society" for Vocal Music. 8. TheCommercial College, with three teachers, just over 50students. 9.The Normal Department with a fouryears' course, counting nearly 250 Normal students.10. The M. I. Association Normal Course. 11. TheSunday School Teachers' Normal Course. In the faceof the immense amount of work which this Insti-tution is performing for the benefit of the youthof Zion, it is greatly to be lamented that the Boardof Trustees of the Brigham Young Academy findsitself drifting irresistibly towards financial break-ers, that threaten a catastrophe too serious in its resultsas that such a possibility could be contempleted withequanimity by any lover of our Youth. 
 at noon; and a public meeting in the Tabernaclein the afternoon, after which we took our de-parture from St. George, having been appointedfor on evening meeting at Washington. That mee-ting there was crowded, and Karl Gottfried Maeser|I noticed with muchsatisfaction the presence and close attention of theyounger portion of that community. Monday, Nov. 6addressed a large meeting in the evening at Toquer-ville. As there are several young people from thisand other places in St. George Stake attending theNormal Course for Sunday School, and M. I. Asso-ciation Work at the Brigham Young Academy, at Provo, a vast improvement in these institutionsthroughout the Stake is looked forward to afterthe return of these Normals. I am sorry to statehowever, that one of them, Bro. Jedediah Larsonof St. George, died at Provo last week, of pneumonia.Tuesday, Nov. 7, we arrived in the afternoon atKannarah, and I addressed as per appointmenta large meeting there in the evening.  It wouldbe ridiculous, if it were not too sad, to notice therestraint ^under^ which the young men felt themselvesobliged to ^be^ in that place, to behave themselves atleast sufficiently during the meeting, in order notto become absolutely offensive.  "You see, Bro. [Maeser],"so said the Bishop to me, "Stockraising is [capacitated to]never to be seen in decent society." 
 Upon the representation of the undersigned, the StakePresidency of Utah Stake with the consent of the High Coun-sil have organized and appointed a "Stake Board of Educa-tion", to whom henceforth the "Board of Trustees of the B.Y.A."will be held accountable.  This new Board sustained the ac-tionof the last Stake Conference, to suspend for the pres-ent academic year the operation of the "Religion Classes" inthis Stake, in order to give the Sunday School NormalClasa a fair share to demonstrate its thoroughgoing influencefor good.  By appointment of Pres. Smoot I filled an appoint-ment in connection with Bp. Booth at Springville, whilethe Principal and teachers of the Academy filled similarappointments in the other Wards of this Stake, in orderto educate the people ^up^ to an appreciation of our educationalaims.Sanpete StakeIn compliance with appointments made for me by Pres.Canute Petersen for the time I had placed myself at hisdisposal, I started for Mt. Pleasant, Tuesday, January 17 to address a public meeting in the educational interest thatsame evening, and to visit the Seminary the next day, andmet with the Local Board.  Bro. Geo. Christensen, the 
 Wednesday, Nov. 8, we returned to Parowan, where the sameevening a meeting of the Seminary Board was held, at whichthe devotion of the members under the wise leadershipof Bp. Charles Adams, manifested itself very markedly.The Seminary had opened five weeks before under thePrincipalship of Bro. Frank Cutler, who has accepted theposition under the conditions of the usual pro rataplan, and has gained already within that short timethe confidence of the community and of his pupils,so that the attendance at his Seminary is daily increas-ing.  His records are in first class order, and his plans,programs, methods, and general progress of his workvery satisfactory, so that he expects to have an assistantbefore long.  His Sstudents comprise the 6, 7, & 8th grades.Much credit is due to the Seminary Board for fittingup and furnishing the Seminaryrooms in such ahandsome and suitable manner.  A reception to addressme by the Authorities and People of Parowan in theevening, I completed only in my capacity as a representativeof the General Board of Education in whose names I thankedand congratulated them for their appreciation of the aimsof that honorable body, and expressing the hope, that 
 Principal, is one of the ^our^ most conscientious and efficientIntermediate teachers, and as such I recommend him tothe consideration of the General Board. This Seminaryis held in one of the former Ward School Houses, but con-tains only one room, in consequences the students arevery much crowded, and soon the engagement of anAssistant Teacher, although much needed, becomesinexpedient. The wise and energetic course of Bp. Lund,the chairman of the Local Board, has made therevival of this Seminary a possibility.  It is questionable,however, if the Seminary will be able to run the  full 40 weeks this year; but the Local Boardare determined to make all possible efforts for afull academic year the next time. They could havenearly 200 students willing to attend, if they could ac-commodate them.Sanpete Stake Academy, Ephraim. Wednesday, Jan. 18,I left for Ephraim with the afternoon train, to address apublic meeting in the evening on the usual topic, andto attend the Stake Academy the whole of the followingday. Bro. Newton Noyes, Principal, with Bro. John PetersonAssistant, no lady-teacher. In the Intermediate dept,every seat was taken, but the Preparatory Dept. had asmall number of students.  This does not reflect, howeverin a derogatory manner upon the faithful labors of 
 At the meeting of the Stake Board after schoolhours, theestablishment of Religion-Classes on the basis of the Cir-cularletter, was decided upon, and Bro. J. D. Call appoin-ted as Stake Superindendent.  The Recordbook of this StakeBoard of Education shows are very punctual attendanceof all the members, regular meetings, and comprehensianof the importance of their mission.  By previous ap-pointment I attended and addressed with Pres. Paxmana meeting at Mona, and the following evening atLeban, in the interest of the rising generation and star-ted for Milford, Wednesday, Oct. 25th arriving at Beaveron the day following, where I had the privilege of ad-dressing a large meeting in the Second Ward meeting-house the same evening on the usual topics of mymission.Parowan StakeFriday, Oct. 27, I left for Paragoonah being met at BuckhornSprings by a conveyance from the former place, as I hadto address the people there in the evening by appointmentfrom Pres. Uriah T. Jones.  The want of reverences & old age,divine and sacred places, things, principles, and times,and for the Priesthood, which has developed among 
 Bro. J. Peterson, but it is only the result of the condition of af-fairs, in as much as children of that grade prefer to availthemselves of the free tuition in the District Schools.The school is in a healthy condition, and thePrincipal with  ^and^his Assistant are much thought of by the Authorities andthe People on account of the influence which they exerciseboth intellectually and spiritually over their students.Manti Seminary: Friday, January 20, I attended the L.D.S.Seminary, at Manti, Bro. Andrew C. Nelson, Principal, andMiss Flora Bean, Assistant. This Seminary occupies its ownbuilding, tolerably commodious as far the Intermediate Dept.is concerned, but the Preparatory Dept. is located upstairs, withan outside entrance and a drafty, riggety, and inconvenientstaircase leading up to it, forcing teachers and students togo to and fro in all kinds of weather, besides losing agreat deal of time, while with a little change in thearchitecture and comparatively small expense, allthese evils could be obviated. The Principal is doing afine work. I had designed him for the Principalshipof the Stake Academy, at Ephraim, which should havebeen his proper place, but he concluded to remain atManti in response to the solicitations and promises 
 our youth almost into a general characteristic, impressed itselfupon my mind very forcibly by many observations in thisregard that evening, and taking as my text "The Fear ofthe Lord is the beginning of Wisdom", gave them someobjectlessons on Reverence.  This subject I have followedup on many other occasions since then.  Passing throughParowan the following day, I arrived at Cedarin the evening, attended Sunday School  themorning of the Sunday, afternoon and evening mee-tings.  The necessity of a Normaltraining for SundaySchool workers was very apparent in Cedar City.An extenuating circumstances in regard to the back-ward conditions of their Sunday Schools is the pe-culiar occupation of the majority of the people inthat region of country viz: The dairy business is ta-king young and old during a great partion ofthe year into the mountains, this braking upday [schools], church [schools], and Sunday schools; the youngpeople returning late in the fall educationallydemoralised and requiring much time to getthem back again into the spirit for studying anything.The Parowan Stake Academy.at Cedar City, is conducted by Bro. Holstein Warnera Graduate of the Brigham Young Academy, andhis assistant Miss Sarah Ann Higbee, volunteer teachers onthe pro rata plan.  I am happy to report the Academyin excellent condition both in regard to the required 
 of the Local Board. It appears, however, that this Boardis not able to meet the just expectations, financially, ofBro. Nelson, who therefore, in justice to his increasingfamily, will have to seek for a better position thenext schoolyear. As his case is not the only one amongour churchschool teachers, but the number of similarcases is bound to increase with every year, thus placingus in the deplorable condition to give young teachersan opportunity to obtain practical experience inour churchschools for a few years, or as long as theyare willing or able to look upon their engagement asa mission, but then have to go into the District SchoolService for better pay, and we start again with freshbeginners, supplying the District Schools with efficientteachers, and keeping in the rear with inexperiencedfaces. I again recommend this matter to the earnestconsideration of the General Board.Saturday, January 21, I returned to Ephraim, in order toattend a meeting of the Stake Board of Education, at10 A.M; a meeting of the Religion Class Instructors ofthe Stake, at 2 P.M; and a meeting of the Church-school Teachers Convention of the Stake, at 7 P.M.It gives me great pleasure to report that meeting of theReligion Class instructors, the only one which I have 
 records and the spiritual, intellectual, and dis-ciplinary condition. The Board hopes that Bro. Warnermay make his permanent home in Cedar. The atten-dance in the Intermediate Department was quite lowas yet but a large increase was expected at the begin-ning of the most term. Pres. U. T. Jones has thus farcarried a great part of the financial responsibilitiesof the Board on his own shoulders, a circumstancewhich I have not failed to remind the people of inmy public addresses there. At the meeting of the StakeBoard after school hours I learned that a Bro. Williamsof Kannab, had been appointed Stake Superintendentof Religion-Classes. I have since communicated withthe now appointee in regard to his duties.  A socialmeeting of the members of the Board, parents, andstudents, in the evening gave me an opportunity ofexplaining the necessity of domestic cooperation inour educational system.St. George Stake.A Bro. John E. Miller, of Parowan, did volunteer for thethird time to take me all the way round betweenParowan and St. George.  I deem it a duty of grateful 
 had the privilege of attending thus far. As Sanpete Stakeof Zion has taken the lead in this great movement and ismaintaining its prestige in this respect as well as inthe number of its churchschools, I cannot speak in toowarm terms of the influence for good observable amongthe young people of that Stake. The Normal Class in theStake Academy is attended by about a dozen students, whoare recognized at the Church Normal Training School, atProvo, as "Junior Normals" as "Normals of the First Year."  Fromthat Normal Class quite a number of teachers have beenprepared for the district schools, and are giving generalsatisfaction. Sunday, Jan.22nd I addressed the Sunday Schoolin the forenoon. Public Meeting in the afternoon, and aconjoined meeting of the M.I. Association in the evening.Gunnison Seminary:-  Monday, Jan. 23 I started for Gunnison,to attend a meeting of the Local Board at 5 P.M. and apublic meeting at 7 P.M. in the interest of their Seminary.The following day was spent in the most part at the Seminary,which is held in the nicely fitted up upper room of theRelief Society building. Bro. John T. Miller, Principal,without any Assistant.  Unfortunately, the exercises weremuch interfered with by many visitors crowding in notwith- 
 appreciation to make mention here of that brother'smanner in working out in part his salvation. We left Cedar for Leeds Tuesday, Oct. 31, and  arrived at thelatter place toward evening. A meeting had beenappointed for me here, and was listened to by avery attentive audience, although it appears fromseveral observations that neither Sunday school norM. I. Associations are in an examplary condition,and the spiritual energy of the people in thatplace is in a low condition. There were three lampsilluminating the poor apology for a schoolhouseduring that meeting. These lamps were brought bysome people from their homes when they came tomeeting. Wednesday, November 1st in the afternoonwe arrived at St. George. After having attendedand addressed the Fastmeeting the next morning,I paid my respects to President David Cannonand to the rest of his colaborers in the Temple,and attended by special invitation a meetingof the district-school-teachers of St. George inthe evening. All of them are interested in theSunday schools and M. I. Associations, andpromised me to take an active part alsoin the Religion-Classes. In meeting with theSt. George Stake Board of Education the followingday, the fact was made apparent, that it was notadvantageous to hold the Religion-Classes after 
 standing my request of the previous evening, to leave me alonewith the school in the forenoon, so that I could get achance to see its every-day working. It is my custom every-where to address the students during last half houror so in the afternoon, at which occasion the mem-bers of the Board and patrons of the school are welcome,but not before. According to all appearance, Bro. Milleris a faithful worker and will grow to be a valuableacquisition to our corps of teachers.  There were 45students of the 5th & 4th Readergrade registered.Sevier StakeFor this Stake I left Monday ^Tuesday^ Jan. 234, with the afternoon train,addressed that same evening a public meeting in Salina,and on the following evening one at Glenwoodwhere I was joined by Pres. Seegmiller.Wednesday ^Thursday^, Jan 26, left for Richfield, where I visited the Stake Academyfor several hours, and met with the Academy Board.At the latter meeting, it was concluded to have thelabors of the Academy Board separated from theStake Board and steps to that effect were taken bythe Stake Presidency. The Stake Academy is presidedover by Bro. John Johnson, assisted by Sister MarindaHalliday, both teachers of a high order. 1500 studentsregistered, among whom 17 Normals of the Junior Grade. 
 schoolhours, as the children are then too tired to takemuch interest, and especially many boys have to gohome to do chores; neither could all the good be ac-complished on Saturdays for the same reasons as re-gards to the boys and many of the larger girls. Itwas, therefore, decided to apply to the School Trustee'sto close the district schools one hour at least sooner—one day or two in the afternoon, for the purpose ofletting our children have the privilege of going totheir Religion-Classes. This plan has madeet withmuch favor everywhere, that it has been adopted thusfar since, in St. George, Parowan, Beaver, Sevier, andSanpete Stakes. The Stake Academy at St. George hashad to suspend operation for this academic year,and Bro. Nephi Savage, the former Principal, has ac-cepted a position as teacher in the District schools, buthas been appointed as Stake Superintendent of Religion-Classes. The same evening I filled an appointmentin a meeting a Santa Clara. Saturday, Nov. 4, ad-dressed a conjoined meeting of the M. I. Association ofSt. George, visited the next morning the Sundayschools,and addressed the meeting of the Sundayschool teachers 
 There is a prospect that this Academy may succeed in servinga permanent Principal with the beginning of next schoolyear, "a consummation devoutly to be wished" not only herebut also in the other churchschools.  By appointment ofPres. Seegmiller, I filled appointments in the educational interestat Monroe, Elsinore, Richfield, and Joseph, during the timefrom Friday, Jan. 27 until Monday, Jan. 30, on which dayI left for Beaver, where I had a preliminary meeting with theStake Board andon  Tuesday, Jan. 31.  On Thursday, Feb 2ndmet with the High Council of Beaver Stake at which occassiona "Stake Board of Education" was appointed, as the AcademyBoard has incorporated under the laws of the territory, andits members are under bonds.Parowan Stake.Friday, Febr. 3rd I left for Parowan, where I had to stay untilTuesday, Febr 7 in the morning when I left for Cedar City.  Duringmy stay at Parowan I met with the Local Board of the Sem-inary, addressed the Sunday School on Sunday morning, andpublic meeting in the evening and one in the afternoon. Monday, Febr 6, attended the Parowan Seminary,Bro. Jos. A. Sill, Principal, but no Assistant.  Bro. Sill is anenergetic young man, very much desirous of improving 
 at noon; and a public meeting in the Tabernaclein the afternoon, after which we took our de-parture from St. George, having been appointedfor an evening meeting at Washington that mee-ting there was crowded and I noticed with muchsatisfaction the presence and close attention of theyounger portion of that community. Monday, Nov. 6,addressed a large meeting in the evening at Toquer-ville As there are several young people from thisand other places in St. George Stake attending.  TheNormal Course for Sunday School and M. I. Asso-ciation Work at the Brigham Young Academy, atProvo, A vast improvement in these institutionsthoughout the Stake is looked forward to afterthe return of these Normals.  I am sorry to statehowever, that one of them, Bro. Jedediah Larsonof St. George, died at Provo last week, of pneumonia.Tuesday, Nov. 7 we arrived in the afternoon atKannarah, and I addressed as per appointment,a large meeting there in the evening. It wouldbe ridiculous if it were not too sad, to notice therestraint ^under^ which the young men felt themselvesobliged to ^be^ in that place, to behave themselves atleast sufficiently during the meeting, in order notto become absolutely offensive.  "You see, Bro. Maeser,"so said the Bishop to me," Stockraising is capacitated tonever to be seen in decent society." 
 improving himself in his profession but being unfamil-iar with our educational system, has had a great manydifficulties to content with at first, from which hehas extricated himself very creditably in a great measure.There seem to be many evil influences bearing uponthe young people all through Parowan Stake, whichis to be accounted for to some extent by the dairy-business which takes the young people into themountains a great portion of the year, duringwhich time they seem to be left without guidanceor restraint.  Our teachers have a hard time of itin such neighborhoods.Parowan Stake Academy, at Cedar. I left Parowan, forCedar, Tuesday, Febr. 7 in the morning and addresseda large congregation at the Tabernacle in the morning.Next day, Febr. 8 attended the Stake Academy, Bro.Homer McCarty, Principal, with Miss Mary Middleton,Assistant.  Bro. McCarty is a very efficient teacher, of aCollege training, and a splendid disciplinarian. I have some misgivings as to his spiritual standing as heis the offspring of an apostate family, but havebeen most agreeably disappointed.  Bro. McCarty hashad the difficult problem to solve, to build up aschool that had been going down to the very verger of 
 Wednesday, Nov. 8, we returned to Parowan, where the sameevening a meeting of the Seminary Board was held, at which the devotion of the members under the wise leadershipof Bp. Charles Adams, manifested itself very markedly.The Seminary had opened five weeks before under thePrincipalship of Bro. Frank Cutler, who has accepted theposition under the conditions of the usual pro rataplan, and has gained already within that short timethe confidence of the community and of his pupils,so that the attendance at his Seminary is daily increas-ing.

 dissolution and accomplished it to his credit.  Someminor details in method in order to harmonize his laborsmore with those of our other churchschools belong to ourmutual correspondence.  There are about 120 students re-gistered.  After the close of the Academy exercises, a Board-meeting was held, at which it was concluded to organizea Stake Board of Education, in order to avoid in futurethat deplorable condition of "Local Jealousy" that in so manyinstances already has obstracted the best interest of our educational organization.St. George Stake.Thursday, Febr. 9, started for St. George, via Leeds, and arrived atmy destination Friday, the 10th at 4 P.M. After havingattended during Saturday a meeting of the High Councilof the Stake in the forenoon, and a funeral in theafternoon, I spend the morning in consultation withPres. McArthur and Principal Nephi Savage about theStake Academy affairs. Sunday, Febr. 12th found me addressingthe Sundayschool in the morning, a public meeting inthe afternoon, a Wardmeeting in the evening, and byspecial invitation a meeting of the District SchoolTeachers after the Wardmeeting.  Monday, Febr. 12, was 
 a turn in the financial affairs of our people wouldenable the General Authorities of the Church to ren-der such assistance to our struggling churchschools, asthey so much desired to be able to. Being met atBughorn Springs by Bro. Shepherd, of Beaver, I ar-rived at the latter place, Friday, Nov. 10.Beaver StakeThe Stake Academy building at Beaver is now underroof and is presenting an imposing appearance fromthe outside.  It consists of two stories, containing anentrance with room for a flight of stairs and asmall office, two classrooms down stairs, and alarge assemblyroom upstairs with a landing outside.Bro. Shepherd has charge of the building work andexpects to get it all finished before spring.Saturday, Nov. 11, I attended a meeting of the Primariesconjoined, and a meeting of the Religion-Classes.Reinhard Maeser, being Stake Superintendent of thelatter. There was a meeting of the Stake and ofthe Local Board of Education held at theTithingoffice that evening, at which the earnestnessof the members in their endeavor to make theirchurch school system a success was demonstratedbeyond a doubt. Sunday, Nov. 12. visited in com-pany with Pres. White and my son Reinhard, theSundayschool Superintendent, the three Sunday-schools of Beaver, and addressed a Sunday School 
 in the Stake Academy, where Bro. Savage is assisted byBro. Charles H. Miles. It is a pity that such excellentwork has to be done under such unfavorable almostunwholesome conditions. Bro. Savage deserves specialcommendation for his devotion to our Church SchoolOrganization and his Stake Academy in particular.He has labored now five years in that position inSt. George under sometimes very discouraging cir-cumstances.  In appreciation of his devoted labors,the members of the Board have secured him nowa desirable home upon their own personal soverinty.The following day a meeting of the Stake Board washeld, at which it became apparent, that there was noneed for the present for organizing a separate StakeBoard.  During that day, I also visited the DistrictSchools, and paid my respects to Pres. McAllister andthe other brothern at the Temple, spending several hourswith them with much profit to myself. In the eveningwent with Pres. McArthur to Santa Clara and addresseda large meeting there, returning to St. George the samenight.  Wednesday, Febr. 15, went with Pres. McArthurto Leeds, where we held a large meeting in the evening.Thursday, Febr. 16, I parted with Pres. McArthur, startingfor Kanarah, where the same evening a large mee-ting was held the next day I started for Beaver, via 
 Teachers meeting at noon on the subject of the "Guide"and the Sunday School Normal Course, at Provo, as thisStake has as yet no representative at the Normal Course.Addresses in the afternoon meeting and ^at^ the conjoinedM. I. Associations in the evening, concluded my laborsin Beaver Stake, and I started the following morningvia Cove Creek toSevier Stake.Arrived at Joseph City in the evening of Monday, Nov. 13,and addressed there a large meeting on the usual topics,leaving the next morning for Monroe, where a meetingwas held at 1 P. M. The district schools adjourned for thesession and filed into the meetinghouse under the leader-ship of their respective teachers, one of whom a gentilelady, and occupying reserved seats.  The Methodministercame on the stand after the meeting and thanked mein behalf of himself and the children for my instruc-tions on "Reverence."  That same evening I addresseda crowded meeting at Elsinore. It is very gratifyingto me to notice in all the places mentioned inthis report, that former students of the BrighamYoung Academy, are honoring their former training

Sunday, Febr. 19, as usual I hadto address the Sundayschool, and after that a meeting of theSundayschool teachers, in the afternoon a public meeting,and in the evening a Conjoined meeting of the M. I. A.Tuesday, Febr. 21, started with Pres. C. White for Minersville,where I addressed a public meeting in the morning inthe interest of the rising generation.Panguitch and Millard StakeAs I have not visited either of these stakes althoug belongingto this circuit,  it is my duty to state here the reason forthis omission.  After some fruitless endeavors to secure a Prin-cipal for Panguitch Stake Academy, I succeeded in obtain-ing a candidate for the position upon the recommenda-tion of Prof. W. Done, endorsed by Dr. Talmage. The person,however, did not suit Pres. Crosby and was dismissedby him after 5 weeks labor.  Thus was brought the acad.year for that Academy to a sudden end. There is a L. D. S.Seminary, at Escalante, of the same stake, in a flourishingcondition, and a petition from that Local Board, en-dorsed by Pres. Crosby in behalf of the Stake Board isherewith enclosed. The Principal of that Seminary, is a

During all my labors in Sevier StakeI had the privilege of enjoying the company of Bro.Clark, counselor to Pres. Seegmiller in whose absencethe former took me around the Stake. Wearrived at Richfield, Wednesday, Nov. 15. in theforenoon, the remainder of which I spent in theStake Academy. Bro. Allen R. Cutler, Principal,and Mrs. Merinda Halliday, Assistant.  They la[bor]like all the rest of churchschool teachers as volunteersunder the pro rata plan, and are keeping a mostexcellent school. Records, organisation, work, pro-gress, and spirit, are everything that can bedesired, and are duly appreciated by the Au-thorities and the people. Here as in all otherschools which I am visiting, I addressed thepupils, and visitors, during the last hour beforeclosing in the afternoon on some essential edu-cational points. By special request I delivered apublic lecture in the evening and turns of as  ^after having^ metwith the Stake Board in the Tithing office afterschool on the subject of Religion-Classes. Bro. AllenR. Cutler was appointed Stake Superintendent.My labors in Sevier Stake concluded with meetingsat Glenwood, Vermillion, Redmond, and Salina, 
 Bro. Lewis J. Bushman, who seems to have obtained thecordial support of the people at Escalante. In regardto the Millard Stake Academy I have to report, that myappointment for that school had been duly forwardedto Pres. I. N. Hinckley, but receiving no answers I happenedto inquire at Sevier from a citizen of that ^Millard^ County,what the matter was with Fillmore. I was informedthat that Academy had broken up at Christmas,and that Alma Greenwood, the Principal, hadgot off the track in bad shape, and that the M. I.Associations of the whole Stake had likewise gonedown. Thereupon I canceled my appointment forMillard Stake in a letter to Pres. Hinckley, to which,however, I have no answer either. As Alma Greenwoodhas applied to me for his Certificate as a ChurchSchool Teacher, I respectfully ask for instructions, whatto do in the matter.Juab Stake AcademyI arrived at Nephi, Thursday, Febr. 23rd with the noon trainfrom Milford, and attended the Stake Academy theday following Principal Justin Call is a rising youngteacher of splendid qualifications, willing to be taught,and very earnest in his work.

But before arriving at Gunnison proper,I had to meet unexpectedly the Sundayschool childrenwith their teacher at the "Gunnison Field" at 11 A. M.and address them, after which we were received at2:30 P.M. at Gunnison by the students of the Seminarywith their teachers, which also necessitated an addressto them at the Seminary, which meeting was attendedby many parents. There had also been announceda lecture for the evening which duty I performedalso to the best of my ability, but I confessed after thatI was somewhat tired for once.

 Elder W. Woodruff addressed the congrega-tion. Said the principles of the gospel are plainand easy of comprehension. At the same time no man can see the kingdom of God unless he isborn of the Spirit. Our enemies have always failed to accomplish their designs and they al-ways will. The means by which they have been defeated are always so simple that they can notcomprehend them. Alluded to the signal triumphsof this people in the last six months. The U. S. government have tried to grapple with Polygamybut they have been foiled, because it is of God.Dedicate your homes to God, and the devil can haveno power there. On the subject of tithing saidthe man who withholds his just tithes robsGod. No man can prosper and get rich by takingsuch a course. On the contrary God more abund-antly blesses those who tithe their property. Celestial marriage is the only order by which we canreceive any blessings behind the vail. Treatnot this sacred subject lightly. 
 Provo, August 10, 1895.President Wilford Woodruff,Dear Brother,Out of the forty churchschools that hadve been organised since the establishment of our Churchschool System only fifteen have been in operation during the last schoolyear.  The reasons of the closing down of so many churchschools have been twofold.  the first is the finan- cial inability of the Boards of Education to continue their schools without some appropriation either from the people or from the General Board, and the second is the inability of the teachers to continue their labors any longer at the pro rata plan, as theinducements to enter the districtschool service for better salaries became too strong for some.Although several were holding on as long their circumstances would allow, and a few are yet faithful to us at the same rate.The schools in operation during last year are as follows:1. [Brigham Young Academy, Provo, Utah County, Utah Territory|Brigham Young at academy, Provo, Prof. B. Cluff.38 weeks.2. Brigham Young College. Logan. Prof. W. J. Kerr. 38 weeks.3.  L. D. S. College.

No there is no prospect that the Stake Board of Emery ever will do anything in the matter of Educa-tion, and the Local Board at Huntington is manifesting much interest and energy, I should suggest, that the latter ^should) be accepted as the Stake Academy.Diplomas. Diplomas.   Upon the recomendation of the Board of Examiners, the General of Education has issued Diplomas to followingpersons in the years of 1893 and 1894:Milton H. Hardy.

 Salt Lake City, Febr 10, [189]7.President Wilford Woodruff.Chairman Gen. Board of Education.Dear Brother,Since my last report of October 10, 1896 I have visited the Brigham Young Academy, Provo; the Latterday Saints College;Salt Lake City, Brigham Young College, Logan; the Weber Stake Academy, Ogden; S and Sanpete Stake Acadeny, at Ephraimbesides held meetings with Religion Classexercises in many Wards of Sanpete and Cache Stakes.  It is my pleasant duty to report a reawakening of the interest in our educational systems both in regard to Churchschools and Religion Classesnot only in the two Stakes named but also in a great many other Stakes.  This statement is based partly upon my own personal observation and partly upon myextensive and continuous correspondence.And these colleges are doing very satisfactory professional work.  The Brigham Young Academy at Provo is a modelinstitution especially in the socalled Training school.since this division of the Academy is occupying its new quarters. I suggest, however, that the ^draft for the^ new plan and Circular for the next schoolyear be submitted first to a Committeeof the of the Local Board for review & approval 
 Highschools. In addition to the already existing three Colleges, that should represent the climax of our educational organization, I should re=spectfully suggest the establishment of same,Highschools with the necessary three years' course,on a plan similar to the one published as suggested thus far by the Territorial Teachers'Convention of Oct. 6, 1894, with such modifications as the General Board may deem proper to make.I suggest that the Stake Academi'es at Ogden, Pres-ton, and Ephraim be enabled to organized in that way.Board of Examiners. The appointment of Dr. Talmage as President of the University of Utah makes his con-tinuance as a member of the Board of Examin-ers inexpedient in several respects, and if the General Board should decide that dby this appointment of Dr. Talmage a vacancy in the Board of Examiners had occurred, I should suggest that Dr. J. M. Tanner, a former mem=ber of said Board, be reinstated.Appropriations. Realizing fully the conditions thathave made appropriations  for our churchschools well nigh impossible for the last year or two, I approach this subject with great reluctance. Butknowing the vast influence for good amoung our rising generation that has been accom=plished thus far already by our church=schools, I feel it my duty, to present to the Gen=eral Board the necessity for some steps by 
 The Brigham Young College in Logan is doing excellentwork as far as it is able to, being subject to great inconve-niences in regard to no recommendation.  Since the partial adoption after my repeated urging, of the theological, domestic, and moniterial systems, this College is now in l completely in line with the spiritand mind of the General Board.  This statement refersmerely to the faculty as I had no opportunity to meetwith that Local Board.  The Latterday Saints' College is doing as good work as far as its present plan [objecties],the incovenient accomodations, and the uncer-tainty in regard to its future condition will permit.There are three Stake Academies that henceforth shouldbe definitely reorgnized as Highschools and have theircharters changed accordingly.  This step is appropriate on account of the work done by them and the in-fluence they are exercising. These Academies are the Stake Academies at Ephraim, Preston; and Ogden.The Stake Academies at Vernal, Paris, Oakley, Rexburg,and Diaz are doing very satisfactory Intermediateand Primary Grade work, while the Academies at Juarez and Mesa City are still laboring under makeshift arrangements.  The Seminary at Huntington has had a very satisfactory run for two terms this schoolyear.This makes 14 churchschools in operation at present.Bro. Geo. Reynolds and myself were appointed at the October meeting of the Gen. Board a Committeeto reviw Gen. Circ. Nos. 7 & 8 in accordance with the requirements of the advanced conditions of our Church School Organization.  In [commencing] our labors for this purpose we soon discovered that 
 Salt Lake City, Oct. 10. [189]6.President Wilford Woodruff.Dear Brother,I herewith submit to you and the General Board ofEducation the statistical report of our churchschools for the academic year 1895–1896, ending June 30th last.A financial report could not be made out as not all schools have reported their financial condition, and some gave only approximate statements.A general review of our churchschools based partlyupon my personal observations and partly upon re-ports from the respective Boards and faculties has given the following results for the past schoolyear:I. Schools.There have been in operation: 3 Colleges, 12 Stake Academies, and 1 Seminary,. They were distributed 23 in Idaho, 9 in Utah, 2 in Arizona, and 2 in Mexico.II Teachers.There have been 86 teachers laboring in our church-schools during the past year, ^of^ whom 8 hold academic diplomas, 18 intermediate certificates, 55 annual li-censes, and 5 special licenses. 
 by  which ^not only^ the closing down of some more of our churchschools can ^may^ be averted, but also the reo-pening of those now closed facilitated, and the establishment of new ones encouraged.Permanency of Teachers' engagements. It is very gratifying to me to report that my endeavors to convince Boards of Education of the great ben-efits of permanent engagement of faithfuland efficient teachers, have been effectual in several instances, in as much as the Principals of our churchschools in Provo, Logan, Salt Lake,Ogden, Preston, and Emphraim, and some of leading teachers have been laboring in their respective positions for several years, and are not desirous of any change.  To encourage this beneficant condition, I should suggest the plan, that at some furture time a portion of the annual appropriation made by the General Board for our churchschools be set apart as a premium for such teachers of ours, ashave remained five years in our service.This premium might be correspondinglyincreased at every fifth year afterwards,until a certain worthiness for the respective teacher's grade be reached.Circular No. 9 and Letterheads.  The Board of Examiners have revised Circulars No. 7 & 8, as instructed by the General Boards, and the manuscript can be made ready for print as Circular No. 9, whenever the General 
 more interpolations and incidental changes in the existing copies of Circulars Nos. 7 & 8 would prove entirely insufficient especially in regard to the requirements for examination of teachers for the various grades, and to the outlines of studies.There will have to be interpolated a whole course of studies for the Highschool Grade, and the Collegiate courses have also to be greatly revised.  I suggest respectfullythat these alterations be furnished every churchschoolin a typewritten copy and published for general information in the Church School Papers as fast as they are required.The Board of Examiners have held several meetingsand have a large lot of applicants for examinationin the several grades before them.  They propose to hold in future one examination for all such applic-ants.  This examination to be held shortly after the schools have closed that is at the latter part of June.I should suggest also the holding of a Church School Con[v]ocation during one week at the same time with the examinations, place, time, and details to be determined by Committees appointed by the Gen. Board.Since the publication of the "Outlines for Religion Class 
 III Studies.there have been 54 different branches taught in 643classes. Some of the latter recited 5 times a week, some 3 times, and some twice.IV Students.The total number of students reported as having at-tended our churchschools during the year is 3112, of whom 1825 are males, and 1287 females. They were re-gistered as 447 Primary Dept; 443 Preparatory; 1016 Inter-mediate; 76 Commercial; 428 Academic; 672 Normal;leaving 20 unaccounted for.V Board of Examiners.In consequence of the appointment of Bro. J. M. Tanneras President of the Agricultural College, his [illegible][illegible] by the General Board of Examiners becomes inconsis-tent and conflicting, in as much as he is now exofficioa member of the Stake Board of Examiners, and thevacancy thus occasioned should be filled by some one else.The Board of Examiners held four regular meetings during the first year, and its members have been en-gaged in examining canidates for diplomas and certificates, some of these examinations are still pending.Following points from the minutes of the last mee-ting of the Board of Examiners are herewith respect-fully submitted for the consideration of the General Board of Education:1. Bro. Wm J. Kerr moved the recommendation to the General Board that in cases where persons 
 Board should desire to order its publication.In consequence of my extensive correspondence,my supply of large letterheads has been exhaus-ted for a long time, as also are the blanks for Statistical Reports. Both items are of some importance in the transaction of our running business, and I would respectfully ask for a new supply.Uintah Stake Academy,  at Vernal, will reopen again this fall, after having been closed for one year. The Board there have erected an addition to their original Academybuilding, consisting of a large classroom and a Principal's office. Their indebtedness amounted in all $695 00, which since last Sunday, they expect to cancel within a week or two by private donation.The people of Uintah Stake are very enthusiastic for their Academy.Religious Classes. It gives me great pleasure to report the Stakes of Utah, Sanpete, Tooele, Beaver, and Box Elder, as energetic and faithful inthe maintenence of the Religion Class move-ment, although even there many obstacles, consisting chiefly in the indifference of the authorities toward it, have to be overcome.In some Stakes the presiding authorities are positively against it notwithstanding my endeavors to plead the cause.Gen. Supt.'s visits and labors. Not having any fundsto defray traveling expenses to the various chu[rch]- 
 Work, a copy of which accompanied by a Circular letter of Dec. 15, was sent to every Stake Presidency in Zion, the Religion Class movement has taken a fresh start.Of the 37 Stakes 18 have answered in the affirmation and I am in communication with their respective Stake Superintendents of Religion Classes, answering questions,sending and recording Licenses for Instanctors, and sending copies of "Outlines."  10 of these 37 Stakes have re-ported that they could not see their way clear for thepresent to introduce these Religion Classes, and 9 have not answered at all as yet.As it will be necessary for me to visit all those Stakes in the first place that have responded to the call for introducing Religion Classes, in order to demonstate by classexercises and explainatory ad-dresses the nature of these classes, and also to urge upon the people the necessity of sustaining our churchschools—the traveling expenses begin to be a point of serious consideration.  My district of labors extends from Alberta to Juarez Stake, and I have traveledall that distance thus far at the expense of the Deseret Sunday School Union as I combined my labors in that organization with those of the Church Schoolinterest.  But these Religion Classes require my visitsat times when I cannot combine them with the Sun-day School work.  I submit, therefore, your instructions in this matter.Your brother in the Gospel,Karl G. Maeser. D. S. DGen Supt. 
 have completed courses and received the bachelor's degree from an institution of recognized standing, the Board of Examiners may at their discretion acceptdiplomas in lieu of examination, and recommend to the General Board the issuance of certificates to teach in any school of the church, and that such certificatesshould entitle such individuals to similar recognition as accompanies a churchschool degree.2. Bro. Benj. Cluff moved that college cheers be restric-ted to special occasions and under proper regulations.VI. Circulars.General Circulars Nos. 7. & 8. have become absolute in some points and a revision of them is indispensable.I should recommend the appointment of a com-mittee for that work with instruction to report at an early date.VII.

 Provo, May 11, 1895.President Wilford Woodruff.Dear Brother,The first Presidency being too busy last Thurs-day to hear my report and to give me some much needed instructions in regard to our churchschool affairs, I feel it Amy duty to ad-dress you in writing on some of the most pressing subjects that need immediate at-tention.1. Referring to Pres. Cannon's instruction to me in regard to Dr. Talmage's retirement from the Board of Examiners, I report, that I had an interview with Bro. Talmage on the subject. He stated to me that he had of-fered his resignation from the membershipin that Board to the First Presidency but that it had not been accepted,. He would prefer now to remain until the question of the conferring of degrees and diplomas by any of the churchschools would have been settled definitely in accordance with the decision of the General Board of Education. He understood that Prof. Cluff was determined to issue degrees [an]d diplomas this coming commence-ment to his graduates in spite of the General Board 
 schools, I have endeavored to unite my visits to them as much as possible with my travels in the Sundayschool interest, and have met with Boards of Education and Localties, held public meetings on the subject wherever achance presented itself. Besides this a very extensive correspondence has been carried on constantly, so as to enable me to keeptrack of the conditions of Boards and Schools.I find that some Stakes have thus far paid no regard at all to the Circular of the General Board of Education, of June 8, 1888, as far as the organization of a Stake Board is concerned,and others that have organized once, have suffered ^it^ to drop out of sight again. If all the General Conference next October, or insome other way the First Presidency wouldurge upon their Stake Authorities the impor-tance of this move, it would prove a greatstimulus to our works.With kind regards,Karl G. MaeserGen. Supt 
 2. In order to ascertain the truth of Bro Talmage's statement I had an interview with Bro. Cluff last night at his office and obtained from him following answer: He had just returned from an audience with the First Presidency, who had approved of his propositions. What those propositions had been, Bro. Cluff did not inform me. In regard to the bestowal of de-grees and diplomas he was resolved to bestow them as he had done for the last three years. When I reminded him of the discussion on the sub-ject in the last meeting of the General Board and the decision arrived at then,and that I would furnish him an extract on that point from the minutes, I said that he did not care for those minutes, and that nothing but a written injunction from the First Presi-dency could stop him.3.

 Provo, Oct. 12th [189]4.President Wilford Woodruff.Dear Brother,Suplementary to my synopsis of the statistics for theacademic year submitted to you under date of Oct. 3rd,I beg leave to make following additional statements:Churchschools discontinued since close of schoolyear:Seminaries: Central, 18th Ward, Gunnison, Huntington, andParowan.  Stake Academies:- Farmington, Castle Dale, Malad,Richfield, Snowflake, and Vernal = Total 11.Uncertain:Stake Academies at Ogden, Coalville, and Preston. = 3.Running:Brigham Young Academy, Brigham Young College,Latterday Saints College, Academics: Rexburg, Oakley,Ephraim, Nephi, Cedar, Thacher, Maricopa, Diaz, andJuarez, = 12.Not yet reported:Manassa. = 1.Boards of Education.Although the various Boards of Education havebeen urged repeatedly both in the Churchschool Papersand by special communnication, to meet regularly 
 Provo City, Decemb. 13, [189]4.President Wilford Woodruff.Dear Brother;Bro. Geo. Reynolds has submitted to me Dr. J. E. Talmage's letter of Nov. 17, addressed to you, containing his requestfor your permission to have the sug-estive outline for a "Course of Study for the High Schools of Utah Territory" dis-tributed among our churchschools for the purpose of obtaining suggestions from our teachers. He also proposes to have this course after its final adoption by the Legislature followed by our church schools for the sake of harmonious education in the secular branches.I have had this matter under con-sideration for some time, have stu-died the "Outline" over very carefully 
 2. has placed me as your agent in such cases, especially as far as the BrighamYoung Academy in Provo is concerned, into a delicate, uncertain positions and forcinged me to pursue a hesitating and passive course, to which an entire release from all connection with that institution would be far more preferable.4. Bro. Cluff informed me also that he had engaged with the full approval of the First Presidency, Geo. Phillips of Ogden as Professor. Having been under the painfulnecessity of investigating that man Phillip's conduct in Bear Lake, Ogden, and Provo,while he was in the churchschool service,and having found him entirely unworthyto be an instructor of our youth, I most emphatically protested against such an engagement. Bro. Cluff told me, that Phillips had been rebaptised and so forth.Knowing the character of absolute unrelia-bility of that man, that state of his does not go far with me, although I shall give him the benefit of my best wishes and hopes for his reformation. I do not think it is wisdom to place that man, so soon after his repentance, asan instructor in the leading church 
 Provo City, Sept. 15, 4.President Wilford Woodruff.Dear Brother,On my returning from my California Mission last month, I found the statistical reports from many of our churchschools still missing notwithstanding the repeated reminders that have been sent into all directions. There are still a few lacking making it impossible for me to submit to the General Board of Education a complete summary of our Church School Organisations for the academic year 1893-1894. I have witten, however, to the few dilatory was urgent letter requesting them to send in their reportwithout fail before the 19th inst. in order to unable us to get up the complete summary one week before October Conference.Schools organised and in running order for the insuing academic yearBrigham Young Academy, Provo, Prof. Benj.

 once in three months for the purpose of deliberatingin regard to the best means for advancing the edu-cational interests in their respective Stakes, in toomany instances this rule has been entirely neglec-ted, and some of them have not met once duringthe whole year.  In consequence of which neglect,several churchschools have closed down that couldhave been saved with comparatively little effortand the Religion-Classes received no attention at all.Teachers.Not too much can be said in praise of many of our churchshoolteachers, who have carried theirrespective schools during the last two years not onlyat their own financial risks at great sacrifice,but also in some instances without any encourag-ing word on the part of their respective Boards.We are losing this year a majority of our bestintermediate teachers that have to [enter] theDistrict School Service, not being able to holdout any longer without the necessary financialand moral support.Revision of Gen. Circ. Nos. 7 & 8.The discontinuance of the Church University andthe changes in our Churchschool Organisation, asset forth in the "Official Announcement" ofAug. 18, last, are making changes in Gen. Circ.Nos. 7 & 8 indispensable, in as much as in theadministration of our affairs constant referenceto there guides has to be made. 
 and will have to suggest some alter-ations as far as our Stake Academies are concerned. I have also sent copies to several of our prominentprincipals and teachers with the request to let me have theirviews on the subject.Thus far I am prepared to state,that a somewhat similar planwill have to be followed by our Stake Academies in the future or else we should be left behind and the secular "Highschools" would absorb our more ad-vanced students. The consequenceof this would be a retrogradation of our schools to the level of dis-trictschools. Instead of branches proposed on that "Outline", that are not essential in our eyes, I should recommend branches in Technics (orManual Labor) for both sexes, and instructions in Agriculture and Horti-culture.With kind regardsKarl G.

Cannonsome years ago in regard to the character of the persons whose names I should submit to Pres. Woodruff for his approval as churchschool teachers.5. A meeting of the General Board of Edu-cation at an early date would be most desirable, as the condition of our Stake Academies requires some steps to be taken in order to place them upon as per-manent basis and raise them to the Highschool standard, without which our whole educational system would be swamped by the new order of things at the approaching statehood.With kind regardsKarl G.

Chairman General Board of Education.Dear Brother,During my last circuit through the Stakes in Mexico, Arizona, and Colorado, that the Saints were desirous more than ever for the advantages of one church school edu-cation. In consequence, therefore, the Juarez Stake Academy takes the lead among the four churchschools in Mexico, namely at Diaz, Dublan, and Pacheco. The Juarez Academy will soon be ready to occupy the newand commodious premises provided for here by the energy and devotion of the authorities and people of that flourishing community.

 17 1/2 Oak Str. San Francisco, July 27. [189]4.President Wilford Woodruff.Dear Brother,Having been set apart for my mission to California,at the Historian's Office, Friday, January 20th last, I started,accompanied by my daughter Ottilie, for my destination,Monday, January 23, and arrived at San Francisco, Wed-nesday, January 25. Elders John L. Dalton and Ezekiel L. Blo-gett recieved us at the landing with whom I shortly afterproceeded to the Midwinter Fair Grounds to present my letterof introduction to Mr. Badlam, Secretary of the ExecutiveCommittee. It gives me much pleasure to report to youthe uniform kindness with which Mr. Badlam has trusted me in consequence of which all preliminary arrange-ments for our educational exhibit was greatly facilita-ted.The Exhibit.A place ^space, 15 x 17 ft^ on the North Gallery of the Liberal Art-Buil-ding, had been assigned us, by th and we proceeded atonce to dedicate that place in a quiet and undemon-strative manner.

 Provo, September 28,President Wilford Woodruff, Chairman General Board of Education.Dear Brother;The continuance of the financial depression [as]been very trying to our churchschools during the acayear 1894–1895. Some of the fifteen remaining stu[dents]have had to struggle not only with the almost ov[er]whelming financial difficulties, but also with unpardonable indifference of many member's onthe Boards, thus throwing the whole burden of [car]rying on the school upon the shoulders of the [teach]ers, some of whom have grown quite discoura[ged]on account of it.Each one of our three colleges is now in a ba[d]condition in regard to attendance as well as [i[nprofessional work than ever before, so are the Stake Academies at Ephraim and Preston. The latter two are preparing for the highschool cors[es]according to the instructions from the General Board, and in due time, will apply for the pro[per]charters. The Academies at Nephi, Rexburg, C.City, St. Joseph, Diaz, and Juarez, have been con[ducted] 
 Provo,  Decemb. 29. [189]4.President Wilford WoodruffDear Brother,After carefully considering the repres-endtations made by Dr. Talmage nthe one hand, and by the Principals ofour three Church Colleges on the other,I have come to the conclusion that theGeneral Board of Education has toadopt a conservative medium bet=ween the two extremes.Der. Talmage insists upon certain re-citations upon all church school forwhich demand he has no foundationsThe "Official Announcement" of Aug. 18,last refers only to the suspsension of theChurch University and to the transfer ofits intended work to the University ofUtah, and making provisious for stu-dents of our faith to desire theologicalinstructious in the L. D. S. College.  Thepeople were exhorted also to support 
 commence our labors in representing to the people the spirit and status of the Education among theLatterday Saints in Utah. To this end the leadinginstitutions of our Church School Organisationhad been communicated with and promisesfor cooperation had been obtained from theBrigham Young Academy, at Provo, and fromthe Latterday Saint College, at Salt Lake. Dr. JamesE. Talmage also contributed from his own privatecollection rare specimens of microsopic views.All these were to be augmented by a large con-signment of the principal publications of ourChurch by Geo. Q. Cannon & Sons.For some unexplained reason much delay wasexperienced in obtaining our boxes from theEast and our exhibit remained empty untilSaturday, Febr. 24, when a portion of them wererecieved, put up and made ready for opening theexhibit on Monday, Febr 26. It was a very incom-plete exhibit, as far as the educational part wasconcerned, for none of the things from theBrigham Young Academy had arrived yet.But the specimens in Drawing and Penman-ship from the Latterday Saint College, andBro. Talmage's photographic views, with the SundaySchool Charts helped me out considerably in thatline, although compared with the other educa-tional exhibits of Santa Cruz County, St. Mary's College,Mills College, Deaf and Dumb Institute, and the 
 Provo, Oct. 3rd, [189]4.President Wilford Woodruff.Dear Brother,In compliance with the regulation I most respect-fully submit herewith a short synopsis of the sum-mary statistical report of our churchschools for the academic year 1893-1894.Distribution of Schools.In Utah 18; in Idaho 4; in Arizona 3; in Mexico 2; Total 27.Grades of Schools.Colleges 3; Stake Academies 19; Seminaries 5; Total 27.Standing of Teachers.By Diplomas 8; by Certificates 29; by Licenses 80; Total 117.RoEngagements of Teachers.Principals 27; Regular Teachers 65; Specialists 25; Total 117.Sex of Students.Males 2080; Females 1750; Total 3830.Grades of Students.Primary Dept. 814; Preparatory 783; Intermediate 11579; Academic 241; Normal 744; Commercial 89; Total 3830.Dr. Karl G.

 very satisfactorily, although changes in the principalship of the academies at Nephi, Cedar Thatcher, and Juarez had become unavailable.Stake Board of Uintah have reopened their Academy with an efficient principal and and fair [pros]pects, so will Emery Stake by because of creating ^changing^ Huntington Seminary into the Stake Academy,advised by the General Board. The Stake Boardat Fillmore also has written for a principal to [illegible] their Academy, but the Stake Boards of [Sum]mit and Parowan have not yet been heard as concerning their intention for the coming [scho]olyear.The schools at Oakley and Paris have had a [sta]gering existence during the past year, the for-mer on account of sickness which spoiled all schools in the place for a season, and the[lat]ter on account of unsuitable locality.Even the new Stake Board of Star Valley is de-[ter]mined to have a churchschool at Afton next [quat]er if possible.In order to carry through more thoroughly [the] aims of our educational system, it will be [ne]cessary, that the circular of the First Presi-[de]ncy of June 8, 1888, respecting the establishment[of] a Board of Education in every Stake of Zion should be enforced more emphatically, so that the provisions of the other circular of the FirstPresidency, dated Oct. 20, 1890, concerning the 
 all those schools may receive more frequent official visits, their teachers can meet and be instructed in methods of teaching, and their labors be placed upon a more harmonious basis. During the summervacation they will hold a two-weeks Con-vention, to which the authorities and members of the respective Boards of Education will be invited. All the Boards of Education in Mexico, ^and^ Arizona have been told by me that there would be no prospect of an appropria-tion for next year and that, therefore, all their calcu-lations must be made with that point in view. The schools in Mexico are in a satisfactory conditionwith the exception of Pacheco. In order to lift that school out of its old rut, the lo[c]al Board of Education has ap-plied to me for a Graduate from the Brigham Young Academy. I have attended the exercises in each of them for one whole day, except at Pacheco where one hour's stay showed me the deplorable condition of that school. I have instructed by special request of the Stake Presidency all the teacher of our schools in Mexico, to pay special attention to the Spanish language, to the Geography, History, and Laws of Mexico, and to conduct their Arith-metic with particular reference to Mexican measures and conditions.Our Schools in Arizona.St. Joseph, Maricopa, and Snowflake Stakes of Zion are determined to reopen their Stake Academies next

In an article on the sub-ject, explanatory to the "Official Au-nouncement; published by order ofthe General Board, under date ofSept. 18, last above my signature, ourchurchschools were instructed toconsider themselves feeders to theState University. The reason for thisis obvious: It is better to have ouryoung people pursue their Univer-sity course at our home institutioninstead of going abroad for thatpurpose away from our controland influence.All this refers enclusively to Univers-sity courses and their preparatory stages.In conformity with this understanding,our Stake Academies are now trying toarrange their curricula according tothe prepared courses for highschoolsas near as possible.  There are, however,three Church Colleges, that are notmere Stake Academies, and havebeen authorized to conduct academiccourses before our Church University 
 University of California, all adjoining ones on thesame gallery, we stood as yet a poor show. The church-works made a fine display though, and were assistedin that by the grand picture of the First Presidency, thelarge picture of the Temple, representations in frameof the Latterday Saint College; the Utah Sugar Works,and a large album with the portraits of our LeadersAll these furnished me abundant material for ex-planations and testimony. Notwithstanding theas yet incomplete representation of our education-al status, visitors commenced to increase daily innumbers and began to manifest greater intresteither pro or con as time went on. After severalweeks of vexations delay the contribations from theBrigham Young Academy finally  ar[ri]ved and lif-ted us at once upon our equal footing, educationally speaking, with the other exhibits on the gallery.Foremost among the B. Y. A. specimens were the two large cases of Carving Work, of the "Pocket Knife Class"as Professor Townshend, who has charge of that de-partment there, calls it. There something like it inthe Midwinter Fair, as claiming to have been done 
 G. B. E.fall, and their written applications, with particulars, for teachers will be in my hands at April Conference. In a long interview with the Territorial Superintendent of Public Instruction of Arizona I obtained the promise that the Normal Diplomas from the Brigham Young Academy would be recognized by him and he would ^without examination^issue to any one thus authorized issue a four years' first class certificate to teach ^without^ in any district school in Arizona. Our people in many localities where they constitute the majority may, therefore, get the opportunity of securing teachers of our own faith for their public school. By special invitation also I visited in company with President Hakes the Territorial Normal School at Tempe.The President Dr. Mc Nadden introduced me to the students whom I addressed for a short time by his request. Heshowed us all over the building.The Academy at Thatcher is well prepared to open again in the fall in regard to building and fixtures, as well as to the intelligant way in which President Kimball and his reorganized Stake Board of Education have taken the matter in hand. The Maricopa Stake Board of Education

He could be the one with whom I could communicate in regard to the instructions of the First Presidency and the General Board of Education and to the Religion classes in his stake.Karl G.

 May 31, [189]7President Wilford Woodruff.Dear Brother,The report of Bro. Allen Frost of Snowflake, Arizona,in regard to his plan for young Latterday Saints to at-tend under certain regulations the Territorial Universityof Arizona at Tucson, his correspondence with PresidentHoward Billman of that institution, and the ac-companying letters of endorsement from PresidentsDavid K. Udall and Jesse W. Smith, have beencarefully considered by me.There are two sides to the proposition of Bro. Frostwhich present themselves to me under following aspects:1. While the attendance of Mormonstudents in acorporate capacity at the University of Arizona would,on the one hand, have a tendency to demonstrate tothe citizens of that territory the loyality of the Saintsfor their home institutions, it would, on the other,be of financial advantage to the students themselves,in as much as the traveling expences in most casescould be reduced considerably.2. I agree fully with the objection of PresidentJesse W. Smith, that the hot climate of Tucson is 
 had been established, and were not re-stricted in their labors after the openingof the Church University.  The "OfficialAnnouncement" nor its explanatory sup-plement of Sept. 18, could have, therefore,no application to our Church Colleges;and aAny restrictions in regard to them asprepared by Dr. Talmage are not justifiedby any documentary evidence, and ^They^ woulddeter our Church School Organization fromdeveloping that system of education whichthe Spirit of God has prompted the FirstPresidency to inaugurate in Zion.On the other hand these three Prin-cipals of our Church Colleges have beenconducting collegiate courses, parallelor of equal grade to some of those atthe State University, and are asking forthe privilege of organising came more.As far as these colleges have duly au-thorized professors to conduct such 
 by beginners in that line of work, and thecomments, on it is not frequent and in a highterms. Specimens of Normal physical diagrams,penmanship, and drawings made up the balance.Our exhibit being thus complete, as short timeof notice, limited preparations and circumstan-ces could possibly make it, a large sign infront of our booth with the legend "LatterdaySaints' Educational Exhibit", gave notice toall visitors who we were. A book of visitorswas opened, into which many, about 1200, haveinscribed their names.  There are names fromJapan, Australia, India, Palestine, Egypt, Italy,Greece, Turkey, France, Germany, Scandinavia,England, the United States, and SandwichIslands, names of many creeds, and of allclasses of society in it. With very few exceptions,each one of them had heard my testimony, anda great many more, that did not write theirnames. Our exhibit was opened daily at 9 AMand closed at 5 P.M. as all other educationalexhibits did. We did not open on Sundays,as I had been instructed to do as Bro. Cummings,who should alternate with me Sundays, was calledhome, and I had none else competent to betrusted with that work and my labors cannot be indispensable at our Sunday meetings andSunday schools. 
 is negotiating for the lease of a very suitable building under exceedingly favorable terms at Mesa City, and the Snowflake Stake Board of Education has succeeded in collecting already the greater part of six Thousand Dollars for their new bAcademy building, for which I have drawn their plan.By correspondence during the last three months from the Brigham Young Academy, Brigham Young College, L. D. S. College, and the Stake Academies at Ephraim, Ogden, Preston, Coalville, Oakley, Rexburg, Paris, Vernal, and Cedar City, and from the Huntington Seminary, I learn that that they are in a more prosperous condition than ever before with the exception of the one at Cedar City, which is placed at disadvantage by the establishment of the State Normal Branch School there.The Academies at Provo, Logan, Vernal, Paris, and Ephraim, have either completed or are engaged in com-pleting their new or additions to the old buildings, while Emery Stake Board of Education continues dilatory in finishing their Academy building commenced several years ago.Conventions.In conformity with the devision of the General Board of Education I have divided our churchschools into several districts, each to be provided over by one of the Presidents of the three Colleges, as Inspector. These Inspectors 
 illy adapted for a university. Besides this arises anotherserious objection and that is, that the environmentsof that pronounced catholic town with its largeMexican population do not offer sufficient guaren-tee against questionable influences upon ouryoung people that should go there.It is a well known fact, that this last mentionedpoint in regard to questionable influences does notconstitute a strong factor of consideration in themanagement of American High Schools.It is a mere question of time when it shallbecome imperative upon the General Board ofEducation to create one of our Stake Academies inArizona into a High School for preparatory coursesto one of our own colleges. Such a step would ob-viate the necessity for our young people to go toTucson in as much as that institution is neithernow nor ^will be^ for a long time to come [illegible] ourregular High School grade.Your brother in the GospelKarl G.

 classes, the General Board ought togrant their request in conformity withGen. Circ. No. 8, pages 4 & 5, para 3.These three Principals petition furtherfor the right of conveying degrees withcorresponding diplomas, as results ofexaminations held by themselves, Thisright has been reserved there for to theGeneral Board, with the exception ofthe Brigham Young Academy, at Provo,who, as it appears, has acted arbitrarilyin this matter, once or twice, andshould be prohibited from repeatingthis irregularity.  The diplomas issuedfrom that institution thus far, oughtnot to be recognised by the GeneralBoard.But as there are many students desiringto finish their academic courses in thesecolleges, where they have commencedthem, provided that institution is dulychartered to conduct such courses,it would be well to uncourage theseinstitutions by issuing charters to thateffect, but with such catre as the im-portance of the case required.Professers and teachers holding 
 The Fair closed officially on July 4th at midnight.  Asall educational exhibits commenced packing upthe day following and nothing but confusion andnoise, dust, and turmoil was going on in the gallery.I was obliged to follow suit and closed up also Withthe assistance of Bros. Blodgett and Williams, our twomissionaries here, Bro. Mortensen who had put upour fixings, packed up the boxes and I had themconveyed to the Territorial Exhibit in charge of SisterCaine at the Manshire Hall, from where they willgo to Utah with the rest.The Mission.Soon after my arrival at San Francisco I found thatthe California Mission was in an unsatisfactory con-dition which had just a few days before an [illegible]ted in the disgraceful episode of Greenwell's convic-tion for defrauding his employers. He was the Presi-dent of the Branch and Bro. Dalton had manifes-ted such lively interest in Greenwell that he laidhimself open to suspicion among the Saints.

College, Logan, I learn that hedesires to bestow certain diplomas and degrees uponGraduates from his College, during the commence-mentexercises on Thursday, June 13th. As this is pre-visely the same case as we had under considera-tion in regard to Prof. Cluff's, of the B. Y. Academy,Provo, plan, and for which I asked your consentin my letter of May 20, I suggest that you author-ize me, as it was above at Provo, to bestow thesedegrees to the Graduates at Logan, "in the nameof the General Board of Education".  This oughtto be done with the understanding that thisaction should establish no precedent bindingthe General Board of Education in formulatinga final decision regarding this matter 
 G. B. E.have been instructed to make periodical visits to the schools under their charge, attend the Commense-ment exercises, and examinations of Graduates, and make their reports to me. By this means our educational system is making a very great step in advance. I respect-fully suggest, that I be authorized to call district con-ventions for the respective school districts at Poca-tello, Sale Lake, and Provo, sometime during the summervacation, at which occasions the examina-tions for churchshoolteachers, whose licenses have expired, could be held also.All our Church school Boards have been instructed by me according to the decision of the General Board to have ^keep^ their financial records in shape so that I can examine them at my periodical visits.Religion Classes.Religion Classes are now in running order in Bannock, Bingham, Bear Lake, Cache, Box Elder, Summit, Utah, Tooele, Sanpete, Emery, Sevier, Wayne, Beaver, Parowan, St. Johns, Snowflake, and San LuisStakes of Zion, while Juab, Millard, St. George, and 
 such diplomas and certificates whoshould apply for any position in ourChurch School Organization should re-port to the Church Board of Examinersfor examination in Theology and givesuch ^additional^ evidences of their qualification asthat Board may deem advisable inorder to obtain a corresponding Diplomaor Certificate from the General Board.In this connection it is my duty toreport that in the opinion of the ma-jority of the members of the Board ofExaminers the position of Dr. Talmageas a member of the Board of Examinersis not conducive to the best interests ofour churchschools.  They think that itwould be but natural for the Presidentof the University to discount the efficien-cy of Church School Examinands infavor of Graduates from the University.Dr. Karl G. Maeser Gen.

 the upperhand here; made the most of it. Ourmeeting place, 927 Mission Str, was in an undigni-fied locality, with crowds of loafing and smok-ing Socialist to holding their meetings on the ground-floor at the same time, and crowding at theentrance, thus forcing ladies wanting to come toour meetings, to push their way through the bestthey could. The Saints saw discouraged throughhaving to carry ^in part^ the family of the President, for which the small Branch was not prepared.To the credit of Bro. Dalton it must be stated,however, that he has labored hard and unceasing-ly to work up this mission. His misfortune wasthat he had a family on his hands, when heshould have been free from such anxieties, andthat he had called for more missionaries thenthere was work for them, and finally that neitherhe nor his missionaries, with the exception ofBro. Cummings and to some extent, Bro. Williams,were exactly the kind of men needed in thispeculiar field of labor. Of great assistance tous were our visitors to the Midwinter Fair fromZion who rendered us financial help by theirliberal contributions. But above all the visitsof Apostles Thatcher, Young, Smith, and Lyman, andof Elders ^Goddard^ Reynolds and Roberts have been of greatbenefit to us. 
 I have written Prof. Kesr, that with your per-mission I should bestow these degrees "in thename of the General Board of Education" and,as he has invited me, to deliver the Bacealar-cate address on that occasion.I have no blanks anymore for statisticalreports for all our churchschools.  The prin-cipals are clamaring for it. It is necessarythat some should be printed to help me andof the difficulty.With kind regards,Karl G. Maeser Gen. SuptP.S.

 Office of the General Board of Education.Provo, February 6, 1896.President Wilford Woodruff,Dear Brother:Since my last report the prospects of our church schools have brightened in many respects, so that the resumption of several ^church^ schools, that have been temporarily suspended,can be looked for with much confidence in the next academic year.As already stated in my former report, my visits to the various church schools, with the exception of the three colleges, had to be confined to opportunities afforded me at my Sunday School appointments.This difficulty I have endeavored to partially overcome by an extensive and to some degree exhaustive correspondence and by the monthly Church School Papers in the Juvenile Instructor.The Stake Academies at Rexburg, Preston, and Paris, Idaho are re-ported in a very flourishing condition, but are urgently requesting my personal visit before April conference.  I have not seen them for two years past; and at several points in their organization and methods are reported as neading my personal attention.The Stake Academy at Ogden has recently taken quite a start up-wards, but Pres. Shurtliff and the Stake Board feel reluctant to assume the responsibility of starting the High School course, and will not apply for such a charter at present.The Stake Academies at Nephi, ^&^ Ephraim have made their mark in the educational affairs of their respective localities and are looked upon by the people as leaders in this respect.The Brigham Young Academy at Provo has reached the highest actual attendance she ever had, and is also in spiritual matters conforming closer to the main object of our educational system than of late years.

 Our Sundayschool has been reorganised and broughtinto greater conformity with the pl instructionsgiven by the S. S. Union Board and General Super-intendancy. My efforts in organising a ReliefSociety here, have thus far not been successful, butwe are conducting now a testimony meeting everyThursday evening, which is also attended by strangers.The removal of our meetings to our new [gnatcters] tothe "California Mission Chapel" 29 Eleventh Str,has been a great step in advances, and our mee-tings are well attended now by strangers, and in-quiring friends. A Choir has been organised, taught and conducted until last week by my daughter, Ot-tilie. Since her return home, I have had to take chargeof it myself the best way I could in singing andplaying the organ, being assisted in this work byBro. Hyde, of Ogden, who is attending here the MedicalCollege. As the rent for this little chapel is $30.00 permonth and nearly $5.00 more for the rest of the organs-gas, and water, but Bro. Mortenson is paying $10.00out of it for seat of the basementrooms, there arestill $25.00 to be raised monthly. $15.00 have 
 Although there are yet two points in that institution with which I cannot reconcile myself. The first is the promiscuous use of the title "Professor" on official publications of that institution by various instructors, that are not authorized by the General Board of Education to use that title officially, according to Gen. Circ. No. 8, page 6.The second is, the use of so called "Academy yells", notwithstanding my repeated remonstrances, and the public censure of Apostle Brigham Young,President of the Academy Board.The Brigham Young College, at Logan, under the judicious managementof Prof. Kerr is giving great satisfaction in every respect. It is to be hoped that any remarks to the faculty and private conversation with Bro. Kerr in regard to emphasizing the Apirit of the Latter-day Work somewhat more, will be followed up in future. I object to the use of "Christian Evidences" as textbooks during the finishing course in Theology. We have publications of our own which cover that ground far more satisfactorily.The Latter-day Saints College has been filled to, overflowing this year, and needs more room for the next academic year, or the institution will have to retrogade, which would be a calamity, and reflect disad-vantageously upon this stake of Zion.The Stake Academy at Maricopa had to be carried on this year on the "makeshift" principle.  The Superintendents of the Y. M. M. I. A. volunteering to conduct the school as best he can for the time being.During my next visit there, it is to be hoped, better arrangements for the future will be effected.The Stake Academy at Thatcher is rapidly assuming influential proportions, and promises to become in the near future the centre of our educational system in Arizona.The Juarex Academy in Mexico has been place at a great disadvant- 
 been subscribed for thus far as monthly con-tributions by members of this Branch, one halfof whom are women, either widows or marriedto outsiders. This will be a serious question to besolved, as thus far the assistance rendered ^us^ so[matterrally] runderus by visiters to the Mid-winter Fair and $9.00 Tithing monthly fromSister Caine will cease. As there are severalparties investigating the Gospel and some areready for baptism, some hope is entertainedthat an increase of contributions can belooked for at an early day. The work has nowbegun, and many that have drifted intothe Josephite Church are beginning to reflectand discover that they are on the wrong sideof the fence. Much now depends how this Awa-king is kept up, and that the Lord by HisHoly Spirit may bless and assist the labors ofHis servants in this mission in the future to thesalvation of many souls, is the prayers ofYour brother in the Gospel,Karl G.

 age this year through the retirement of Bro. Dennis Harris from the educational field, the faithful principal for several years. The appointment of Bro. Webb, of Snowflake, as his successor fell through by the miscarriage of letters, and Sister Romney has taken temporary charge of the institution.I am now engaged in assisting the respective Boards of Education in resuming operations for the next academic year in the Stake Academies,at Richfield, Coalville, Castle Dale (see note at end of letter), Beaver,and Snowflake.The Board of Examiners has held two sessions since my last report,and is now engaged in examining a number of church school instructors for certificates of the Intermediate Grade, and some for diplomas. The results of these exam^i^nations will be reported to the General Board in due time with the recommendations required in each case.The Presidents of our three colleges have also been appointed by the Board of Examiners to submit the course of studies for all those branches for which they have been authorized by the General Board to issue diplomas and to confer degrees. Also to submit a suggestive High School plan for those Stake Academies that have been notified by the General Board to apply for a High School Charter, if they choose to.The subject of a Church School convention to be held some time duringthe summer vacation has been discussed at great length at the last meeting of the Board of Examiners, and a notice to that effect has been inserted in the February number of the Church School Papers, requesting our fellow laborers in the Church School organization to give us the benefit of their ideas on the subject.The religion classes have assumed a more definite form of late in Sevier, Sanpete, Cache and Tooele Stakes, by a method of primary teach-ing exhibited by me in several places. A lecture on this subject was 
 P.S.After the departure of Bro. Cummings for home, the Branchat Sacramento was left in charge of Bro. Keller whose personalacquaintance I made several weeks later. Bro. Keller beingentirely inexperienced in writing, it was with much difficult-ty that I could gather some informal news about the conditionof the Saints there the moreso as it was impossible for meunder the circumstances to pay them a visit. It appears,however, that the little life existing in that Branch wentgradually down as soon Bro. Cummings had left, andBro. Keller utterly discouraged, hence my request forhis return. Two efficient elders may be able under divineguidance to revive the work.Bros. Williams and Maycock, laboring in San Bernar-dino and vicinity, reported to me regularly their labors.From their letters it became apparent however, that theJosephites were facing things their own way in SouthernCalifornia, and that these young missionaries weresimply walked over. This opinion was shared by EldersLyman and Roberts during their visit in SanBernardino, Los Angeles, and San Diego. Both youngbrothers, therefore, by your instruction, were transferred 
 recently given by me in the 14th Ward meeting house, which seemed to have met the approval of several of my leading co-laborers present on the occasion.The growing pressure of outside influences upon our youth is a constant source of much anxiety to me. To counteract this evil still more with my feeble efforts, I have yielded to the solitations of former students and of present co-laborers of mine, to consolidate all my educational views into one book, and thus place myself on record before the people in regard to my views on the educational effordts of our people, their history, their final aims, and their methods. This work is about being completed. Before publishing it, however, I would respectfully beg the General Board to appoint a committee of at least three, to whom I could submit the manuscript for any corrections,alterations, or amendments they should desire to be made.I remain, with kind regards, Your Brother in the Gospel,Karl G. Maeser,Gen. Supt.Note: I suggest that the General Board reconsider its resolution to create the Huntington Seminary, the Emery Stake Academy, and grant the request of Pres.

As the steamer stayed at Beyrout one whole day I landed also to see to such business as we had in that city. I wvisited the U. S. Consulate. The officials seemed pleased to see me & offered their servises in our behalf when needed. At Beyrout I also called on the Printer, Mr. Khalil Sarkis. He seemed very anxious for our work and told me he had counted the type on us as our property in his first esti-mate. I did not so understand it. But when he heard I had been to Stamboul & was more familiar with prices he seemed anxious not to loose the job.Next, I called on Mr. Tueni & Co. They offered us the Gire' property, with good titlle about 25,000 dollars less than Selim Khory. They own 2/3 of the property & Mr Khory only 1/3. If the property is wanted it can be had much chea-per I think. At the office of Mr. Tueni & Co, a Jew Mr. Osso-vetsky was introduced to me. He offered me land near Mt Tabor. This I expect also to visit. He holds a good titlle & claims good climate & good land & water for his land.Mr. Tueni gave me a letter of introduction to one 
 Mr Farezli their Agent at Haifa. With him I visited Gire'. I found the country looking very dry. This was to be expected it is the dry season of the year. It does not resemble the green rich looking hills we saw in April. The country looks white with lime stones & boulders strewn over a great deal of the hills. These were covered with grain, grass and weeds when we saw it in the spring, but now the whole country is cleared off by man, beasts & the heat. The low lands on the Kishon were also naked & the land hard as a brick. The whole nature is slumbering in the heat patiently await-ing the early rains which are due now in a week or two. Clouds have already been threatning rain for some days. When the early rains arrive every thing partakes of new life & the farmers will prepare for the next season's crops.I found water in Sseveral plasces. The spring by the villige good though small. There was water enough for house use and cattle but not for irrigation. The Kishon is completely dry from Hartich & up. That is 3 or 4 miles west of Gire-Kamon. The Manager of Gire-Ka-mon & the fellahs generally claimed they were all well and free from Malaria. They all looked well. It is my impression that there is not much Malaria & Sickness. the fellahs or more troubled with eye diseases. The heat is not so opressive though it ranges often between 80 & 100 degrees in the shade. With all the Arabs carry their Winter cloak 
 and wrap their stomachs & heads heavily. ^(A cool breeze is continually blowing from the sea.)^ I obtained a few samples of Grain, which I will forward for your inspection. Mr. Farezli took me to the Delieh & Roha, two villages on the top of the hills toward Samaria, hence nearly south of Gire'. I did not go over all the property, but it look^ed^ like a more gentle rolling hill country. The water suply rather better than the Gire'. But owning to presence of more water they have also more sickness. The fellahs claimed the streams were alowed to spread in the Valleys below and that the Malaria had its origin there. As soon as the Water was confined to its proper chan-nals then it would relieve them of Malaria. As the they are several miles from the Crocodile river and bottoms it seems impossible that they should suffer from that scourse. They are, however, on the head waters of that Malarious stream. The soil of either or all of these properties does not look very rich. It appeared much better in the wet season. The cattle look fair in flesh. Their cattle is of a very small breed.The trees and vegatation in and around Haifa looks much better than I had expected considering the long summer heat & no water. Fig trees, Olive trees, Pomegranites & some Apple trees. Allso every greens & ornamental trees of various kinds, are all looking green & well. They await the rain, & cold weather to follow, to strip them of their foliage. It is wonderful how nature is provided here whereby vegitation can sustain life without Water. 
 Visit to Dr G. Schumacher U. S. Vice Consul.Last week I called on Dr. Schumacher U. S. Vice Consul to Haifa. He is at least a real Gentleman. He at onece warned me against the whole Sursuk property and against the Gire' in particular. He said the whole property was in question & that only part of the Gire' property was secure, the Government claimed the medows. Sursuk by the agressive policy permitted here, had by degrees crow-ded the beduins off by buying a part of the land from the Government. Had it been safe the Germans as well as the Jews had long sinse bought it. He also spoke of the land as being inferior in grade and the country generally un-healthy. He said the Germans had been thankful several times that they did not buy it. They had tryed the Kishon country & had lost many lives. To prove that the property was in dispute he said that one of Mr. Khori's sons desired to be his first dragoman but the Government ob-jected to his appointment on the grounds of the law suit. I have no reasons to mistrust the Consul but I will take steps to assertain more about it in time. Should it, however, prove true, it would, of course, stop all negotiations for the present relating to that property. But they do not own the whole of Palestine, their is still a nicke chunk left of Syria.In speaking of our intentions of settling Palestine Dr. Schumacher said that he and the colonies would be only too glad to assist us in our interprise, this had been their aim & mission & that they would gladly as- 
 sist in any move which looked toward the ful-fillment of the promises to the hHouse of Israel.He refered to the mistakes they had made in not buying more land in the Hauran & in land. They had spendt their strength here on the coast where there was no room for expansion. He said if ^we^ wished they would sell us land here for building a coast or trading post, a place for the reception of emigrants & for imports & exports. And that we might be co-buyers with them in property at Tabor where they were contemplating to make a purchase for a midway villige to the Hauran. He advised to settle the Hauran, it is nowbeing opened up. The Jews have already three settlements. The land is cheap. Good land for 6 francs pr acre, all fees included. Elavation from 1500 to 3000 feet above the level of the sea with a fine climate & good water and plenty of it. It is generally a flat plateau country except the Jebel ed druid [Mount Lebanon], the mountain where the druses live. Dr. Shumacher spoke of the Druse trouble as some thing of the past, that the Government had the control,and that the great plains of the Hauran are perfectly safe. The Consul ought to be good authority. He has Surveyed the whole country for the Government for the Palestine Exprloration Fund, and English society. His works are published & I will try to procure copies of these valuable books for your perusal and 
 send them to you. He appeared very anxious to have us engage with them in obtaining land. He offered to take a trip with me to the Hauran after the Kaiser's visit. I would like to aquaint my self with that country personally, and if I hear nothing to the contrary I shall probably make the trip sometime this fall if I can arrange my business there with. Now that the Girè property is in doubt and no special objective point for a settlement ^being^ in view I am left in doubt as to what course to pursue until I hear from you. In reading our letter of instructions it appears to me that we have are yet far from being thoroughly familiar with every portion of the land that would be likely to furnish a suitable place for gathering." We have followed largely the popular routes, but the out of theway places which offer better oppertumities for development by improving the roads & transportation facilities we do not nknow anything about. The Consul smiled at the idea of the Government refusing to allow roads to be built. He said that was chiefly against the Jews in order to hinder their advancement & to squeeze money out of them. Yet I know personally that the Government often prevents the natives from building roads. I supose there are difficulties but I believe they can be overcome by patience and the help of the Lord.Respecting titles, he said that we could safely buy and receive good titles without much trouble. We had to be care 
 ful to see that our titles were properly issued at first and the limits well defined. Then if any local officer would object to the transfer the Consul would fix the rest by ordering the transfer through the Vali. We have better treaty rights than other nations said Dr. Schumacher & we have no trouble in maintaining them. He said Their worst trouble was with the U. S. Minister in Constantinople. For many years no there was no question of their pass ports. But Minister Terril, a former Minister had raised a point that America had no colonization policy and that those who intended to reside permanently abroad would not be protected. They had only saved themselves by stating that they were herein the Spiritual interest of the people. Should this be found an objection to us we could probably have that ar-ranged by our representatives in Congress.The reception I have received from Vice Consul Schumacher has been a surprise to me. I hope it will take no unfavorable reaction. I hope it is based on some understanding between him and the leading Elders of the Colony; as he has made several unreserved propositions to cooperate with us. I believe the colonists have done fairly well this year. Brother Gran grow & Brother ^Hilt^ say they have done well in wine. I claim continually that this Temple society with all their oddities and old country, old fashioned way have proved beyound a doubt the possibility of inha- 
 biting and living fairly well in Palestine. How much better cannot we do it who are farmore advanced in the method of agriculture and progress in general and less wraptin old superstions and traditional ways.At present I would not advise any Elder sent here ^to labor among the Germans.^ I think that when we commence to gather here the Lord will move upon the people to receive the Gospel. The old fellows will not listen to the Gospel, they have partially rejected it, but the coming generation is different, and if we raise no opposition at present by trying to convert their children to a faith which they fancy is the worst of all, Then it seems to me we can probably work in harmony with them and when we are established in the land the Lord's are bound to come to Him as they are as a comunity decaying & ^the aged^ old dying off gradually. We will preach more effectually with our works, and I believe we have much to gain among these honest, wellmeaning people.Hoping you may be able to find some good in my feeble efforts & something worthy of your consi-deration in my reports from time to time, and further that you will instruct me how to proceed I remain as ever your humble fellowlaborenr in the everla-sting covenant.F.

 Apostle W. Woodruff quotes "A poor wayfaing man" &cSaid that was the last song that Joseph & Hyrum Smithlistened to. It was sung to them by our present Pres-ident John Taylor just before the mob madetheir break upon the jail.Spoke on the follney of riches. Rehearsed the storyof Nebuchadnezzar, Told how he gloried in his wealthand greatness and of his fate. ##Daniel 3## We can put no trust inriches.  Hoped the Lord would never give him so muchriches that he couldnt pay his tithing ^and offerings^ out of it.It is a living miracle to see this great people inthese mountains and yet many of us forget whowe are and the work we have to do. 
 President Woodruff said the Lord has neverundertaken a work he has not been able to perform.This is God's work and we shall not be disappointedin its progress and final issue. Had no fearsin regard to these things. It is not in the power ofman to stop this work. God has command withthe Gentiles that they may be left without ex-cuse in the day of God's power. His workamong the house of Israel will also roll on. Chil-dren will be born after the 1st of Jany Edmundsbill or no Ed. bill. No power can stop it orthe onward progress of this Kingdom. Desiredto see the Saints humble themselves before the Lordand do their duty. 
 Isaiah, the Prophet, ages ago, wrote in great plainness thehistory of this people. He plainly foretold all the scenesthrough which we have passed. We are here in directfulfillment of the prophesies of this great man. Wehave laid the foundation of the greatest work ever com-menced on this earth. Would to God that the veilmight be taken off the faces of this people for justone five minutes that they might get a glimpseof their position as it is. We do not realize thework that is before us. 50,000,000,000 of our race inthe Spirit world and looking to us for salvation. Jos.Smith and hundreds of others who have gone behindthe veil with the priesthood are preaching the Gospel tothem and it is for us to provide temples and worktherein for the dead. We are connected with the greatdispensation of the Fulness of Times. In view of thesethings will we act the fool by turning away fromthe truth. We are all too far from the Lord. It istime for us to draw near to him and to keephis commandments. Had had a great deal of sor-row in his time but had never sorrowed to followa good man to the grave. Could never see anycause for sorrow in such an event. When aman apostatizes that is a time to mourn. Did notwant to live long enough to apostatize.Felt very anxious about the youth & maidens ofthis people. Desired very much to see them exercizingfaith in God. The signs of all heavens & earth pro-tend the near coming of the Son of Man. We shouldbe preparing for this glorious event. Dont forget whoyou are and dont forget your duties as Saints (26 ms)

ARTICLE 11.The Sublime Porte may establish S h a h b e n d e r s (Consuls)in the United States of America, and the United States may appoint their citizens to be Consuls or Vice-Consuls at the commercial places in the dominions of the Sublime Porte where it shall be found need-ful to superintend the affairs of commerce. These Consuls or Vice-Consuls shall be furnished with b e ra t s  or f i r m a n s ; they shall enjoy suitable distinction, and shall have necessary aid and protection.1597. ARTICLE 1V.If litigations and disputes should arise between subjects of the Sublime Porte and citizens of the United States, the parties shallnot be heard, nor shall judgments be pronounced, unless the AmericanDragoman be present. Causes in which the sum may exceed five hundredpiasters shall be submitted to the Sublime Porte, to be decided accord-ing to the laws of equity and justice. Citizens of the United Statesof America, quietly pursuing their commerce, and not being charged or convicted of any crime or offense, shall not be molested; and even when they may have committed some offense they shall not be arrested and put in prison by the local authorities, but they shall be tried by their Minister or Consul, and punished according to their offense,following, in this respect, the usage observed toward other Franks. 11598.

 prietors.Protocol concluded August 11, 1874 (Right of Foreigners to holdreal estate in the Ottoman Empire).1600.  PROTOCOL.The law granting foreigners the right of holding real estate does not interfere with the immunities specified by the treaties, and which will continue to protect the person and the movable property of foreigners who may become owners of real estate.As the exercise of the right of possessing real property may induce foreigners to establish themselves in larger numbers in the Ottoman Empire, the Imperial Government thinks it proper to anticipate and to prevent the difficulties to which the appli-cation of this law may give rise in certain localities.  Such is the object of the arrangements which follow.The domicile of any person residing upon the Ottoman soil being inviolable, and as no one can enter it without the consent of the owner, except by virtue of orders emanating from the compe-tent authority and with the assistance of the magistrate or fun-ctionary invested with the necessary powers, the residence of foreign-ers is inviolable on the same principle, in conformity with the treaties, and the agents of the public force cannot enter it with-out the assistance of the Consul or of the delegate of the Consul of the power on which the foreigner depends.By residence we understand the house of inhabitation and its dependencies: that is to say, the out-houses, courts, gardens, and neighboring inclosures, to the exclusion of all other parts of the property.In the localities distant by less than nine hours' journey from the Consular residence, the agents of the public force cannot enter the residence of a foreigner without the assistance of a Con-sul, as was before said.On his part the Consul is bound to give his immediate assistance to the local authority, so as not to let six hours elapse between the moment which he may be informed and the moment of his departure, or the departure of his delegate, so that the action of the author-ities may never be suspended more than twenty-four hours.In the localities distant by nine hours or more than nine hours of travel from the residence of the Consular Agent, the agents of the public force may, on the request of the local  authority, and with the assistance of three members of the Council of the El-ders of the Commune, enter into the residence of a foreigner, with-out being assisted by the Consular Agent, but only in case of urgency, and for the search and the proof of the crime of murder, of attempt at murder, of incendiarism, of armed robbery either with infraction or by night in an inhabited house, of armed rebellion, and of the fabrication of counterfeit money, and this entry may be made whether the crime was committed by a foreigner or by an Ottoman subject, 
 and whether it took place in the residence of a foreigner or not in his residence, or in any other place.These Regulations are not applicable but to the parts of the real estate which constitute the residence, as it has been heretofore defined.Beyond the residence, the action of the police shall be exercised freely and without reserve; but in case a person charged with crime or offense should be arrested, and the accused shall be a foreigner, the immunities attached to his person shall be observed in respect to him.The functionary or the officer charged with the accomplishment of a domiciliary visit, in the exceptional circumstances determinedbefore, and the members of the Council of Elders who shall ass^i^st him,will be obliged to make out a procès-verbal of the domiciliary visit,and to communicate it immediately to the superior authority under whose jurisdiction they are, and the latter shall transmit it to the nearest Consular Agent without delay.A special regulation will be promulgated by the Sublime Porte to determine the mode of action of the local police in the several cases provided heretofore.In localities more distant than nine hours' travel from the residence ofthe Consular Agent, in which the law of the judicial organ-ization of the Velayet may be in force, foreigners shall be tried, without the assistance of the Consular Delegate, by the Council of Elders, fulfilling the function of justices of the peace, and by the tribunal of the canton, as well for actions not exceeding one thousand piasters as for offenses entailing a fine of five hundred piasters only at the maximum.Foreigners shall have, in any case, the right of appeal to the tribunal of the arrondissement against the judgments issued, as above stated, and the appeal shall be followed and judged with the assist-ance of the Consul, in conformity with the treaties.The appeal shall always suspend the execution of a sentence.In all cases the forcible execution of the judgments, issued onthe conditions determined heretofore shall not take place without the co-operation of the Consul or of his Delegate.The Imperial Government will enact a law which shall determine the rules of procedure to be observed by the parties in the applica-tion of the preceding regulations.Foreigners, in whatever locality they may be, may freely submit themselves to the jurisdiction of the Council of Elders or of the tribunal of the canton without the assistance of the Consul in cases which do not exceed the competency of these councils or tribunals, resreserving always the right of appeal before the tribunal of the arrondissement, where the case may be brought and tried with the assistance of the Consul or the Delegate.The consent of a foreigner to be tried, as above stated, without the assistance of his Consul, shall always be given in writing and in advance of all procedure. 
 It is well understood that all these restrictions do not con-cern cases which have for their object questions of real estate, which shall be tried and determined under the conditions estab-lished by the law.The right of defense and the publicity of the hearings shall be assured in all cases to foreigners who may appear before the Ottoman tribunals, as well as to Ottoman subjects.The preceding dispositions shall remain in force until the revision of the ancient treaties, a revision which the Sublime Porte reserves to itself the right to bring about hereafter by an understanding between it and the friendly powers.If I under^stood^ General Dickensen right— all questions of title to real estate are handled by our Legation in behalf of United States Citizens.F.

 Report on PrintingPresident Woodruff & CounsellorsDear Brethern.  From Apostle Lund I learn that the printing of some tracts have been considered & that the probable cost would be$400. 00/100  I beg leave to report that Bro. Binyad has called the President of the Censor Board and is informed that for about $250. 00/100, (not to exceed thisamount) we can get a general or full permission to print any and all of our works, subject, of course, to the sensor counscil the same as all others.  But when the Permission is given by the Minister of Public instruction & those whose business it is to sign; Then we are recognized as publishers & can open our own printing press etc.  We can also publish our pamplets & books here much cheaper so that I think that there is no question but that we will be able to get the Permission & also print all four tracts suggested for the $40000 here in Constantinople.  I should recommend this course. No money until permission is ready for signature & complete.  This much alone would be a great help. That one branch of the Government assists the other in recognizing us.  Printing permits also shows the officers in the Country that we are recognized.I am informed that the recognition by the 
 government does in no case include the printing privilidge which is independantly controled by the Minister of Public instruc-tions & the Censor Councill. We will therefore need this permit in all cases and will have to make the petition seperately.Brother Binyad has experience in these matters as he had a permission nearly ready for us once but when the Elders here could not furnish the money the Seventh-day Ad-vents got it and now have it although they are not recognized. The President of the Censor board was not pleased with it as he would rather we should have had it as the Advents have been offensive in their publcations for which several were arrested. Bro. Binyad had a couple of days of it before he could prove he was no Advent. This because his name had been connected with the permit.Please give me your instructions in regard to this matter at your earliest convinience so that I may proceed accordinglyRespectfullyF. F.

 Investigation of correspondence be-tween the U.S.Legation & the PortePresident Woodruff & Counsellors.Dear Brethern,I called at the Legation to investigate the assertion of U.S. Marshall Allaimby. That the Legation of the U.S. had of-fered its good office to help supress Mormonism.  I found the Marshall was correct.  It appears that in Oct 1887, the Turkish Government had been stuffed about us opening a printing press & that the editor Mr. Hintze lived at Kom Kapoo,and that they wished the legation to supress it.  Oct 30, 1887 Someone whose name is not attached, came near forgetting the complaint in his attempt to blackmail Mormonism.  He tells the Porte that Mormism was a Statuary crime in America & a disgrace upon civilization, & that they would do all in their power to help supress Mormonism & to prevents its spread in Turkey.  It is an interesting peice of deplomacy, cheifly because of its cowardly attack.  The writer wanted to stigmatize polyga-my but did not dare to mention it where^fore^ he beats around the corner with interesting eloquence.  On Nov 30. the Consulswrites that he has been notified that the government had re-peeded its complaints, telling the Consul that they did not complain of the subject matter, it was only the unlawful printing without permission they opposed.  Consul General Mr. Pringle then tells the Legation that he had seen Mr. Hintze & that it was was all settled by Mr. Hintze delivering up the tracts.(The tracts in question were a few german tracts published by Elders Spori, Tanner & myself.  The publisher assured us it was allright & that no one would question it. But an Armenian betrayed us)With this explanation the affair was settled.  About that time I had had a number of visits with different high of- 
 ficials and they were somewhat informed on Mormonism. And Mr. Allaimby is authority for the statement, that the Porte snubed ^the^ Minister by telling him that the Mormons would be protected as others & hadthe same right: The Turks saw the sceme and they were too smart to be caught. I could not get a copy. When Mr Riddle saw the nature of it, it made him a little nervous and he said with a smile: "Well, I guess that is all burried, is it not? I, of course repyed it was. I saw he was ashamed of it so I did not press it. And although we can ge it through the State deparment at Washington, I think it best to leave it til later on. It ^will^ makes a little history someday. It is very encouraging right now to know that the Porte has taken our part even when attacked by our own. Representation.Upon solicitation I explained our faith to Mr. Riddle. He listened with attention & interest. Also Consul General Dickensen gave me a lengthy audience.Marshall Allaimby loves to speak of his stay in Utah.He speaks in high terms of our people. He remembers PresidentsWoodruff, Cannon & Smith. Also Dr. Park and others.He has offered me his servises several times. He also refers to Mr. Strauss, the coming Minister, as a liberalminded & fair & just man. Mr. Strauss is a Hebrew & as such may do us much good. The reply itself from the Porte I did not see, but Con. Gen. Pringles letter I saw and it bears out the claim of Mr. Allaimby.RespectfullyF. F. Hintze.

 ^6 Febr. 1890^President Wilford Woodruff & Councillors,Salt Lake City, Utah.Dear Brethern.In compliance with your request I cheer-fully place on paper my report of the Turkish mis-sion, and hope I may be able to so write as to give you a proper and comprehensive understand-ing of the work of the Lord in that part of His vineyard.I left Utah for my field of labor in Turkey on the first day of Nov. 1886 and arrived in Constantiple on the 16th of Jan. 1887 remaining about 6 weeks in England in order to obtain a passport. Shortly af-ter arriving at Constantinople I was appointed by Prest. Jacob Spori & Elder J. M. Tanner to the Armenian quarter of Stanboul there to live and study the Turkish language and to become better aquainted with ^the^ natives and their customs.I at once began studying the Turkish langu-age which I was quite successful in acquiring for the purposes required. We, however, found but little response among the people in Constantinople, but it soon became evident that we could do some work in the interior of Asia Minor, wherefore, I recommended 2 more Elders to come to my assistance. Shortly after, about Nov. 1887, Elder James Clove arrived, who after staying about 2 year became sick and was 
 released to return home. In the winter between 1887 & 1888, at the reuquest of Brother Markow I went to Hungaria to baptize his parents. His brother and sister-in-law, but as they needed some more information I waited a couple of days during which time I and Brother Markow testified to many in the villige of Serb Czernia, Hungaria.But on the third day I was called before the preist, a Greek orthodox, and then sent to the magistrate by whom I was ordered to leave the country forthwith. I failled in my attempt to open ^up^ the gospel in that land at that time, but I firmly believe that good will yet be realized from my labors there.I there ordained Brother Markow and Elder and appointed him to labor as best he could and thus intdirectly my labors resuleted in the Gospel being ope-ned up in Belgium. Of the work done at Antwer-ben you are, I beleive, fully advised. Brother Markow has since been been requested to come to Hungaria to baptize his parents. In the latter part of Aug. 1888 I left Constantinople for a trip through Asia Minor with a veiw to see the people and what the prospects were for opening up the door of life there, and also to visit the saints in Palestine. In the spring of 1889 in company with Elder J. M. Sjödahl I visited the Holy land, Palestine, and in the summer the 
 same year I returned to Constantinople preaching by the way. I baptized 6 persons on this trip, I3 of which were local preachers and one a young teacher.  I baptized was released in Dec. to returnhome by President George Teasdale having been in Turkey 3 years within a few days. Altogether I injoyed my mission very much and felt I was very much blessed of the Lord and feel sure that our united labors in that field will yet result in much good.Several elders have been sent to labor in Turkey since I arrived, but according to the best of my knowledge most of them are either released or soon will be, some because of sickness others because of lack of means and, perhaps, but little faith in that mission. There has been about 30 baptisms in that mission and we have many warm freinds.The difficulties in establishing the Gospel in Turkey are many. In order to preach the Gospel success-fully there we should be recognized by the Government. We have petitioned for recognition but have obtained none cheifly because no means were at our command to pay our way.Printing could not be done to any appriciable extent because we were not recognized.While wvisiting Palestine I became convinced 
 that in order to successfully preach the Gospel in the orient and to do those people any marked good that it would be nessesary to colonize there. Some of my reasons for this wevirew are these. The Turkish ^mission^ is so far from our mountain home in Utah that the expences to thouroughly prosecute a long and successful mission are very heavy, hence Elders are few who can meet that demand, and the expences toge-ther with the strange customs and habits of the natives tend to discourage the brethern. Then it is far for the poor saints to emigrate, and they are but poorly prepared to come to Zion as they are but not at all acquainted with our customs and mode of living. Again, it is prohibited by law to emigrate from Turkey; and that to-gether with the jealousy of our own nation would be against oriental emigration to Zion. But on the other hand could we obtain a home in that ancient land of promise, we could there educate the saints to our ways and prepare them to receive both temporal and spiritual progress. The saints there are fully imbued with the spirit of gathering, wherefore they are anxiously looking forward to the day they may be priveleged to gather with the saints to Zion. That land is also the destiny of the Jews, and inasmuch as we are destined to do a great work ffor them, we will be there prepared to do them 
 good and to assist them in every way at our command.My impressions respecting Palestine as a land to sustain life are very good, and though but little can be said of the signs of the fruitfulness of the landreturning, yet there are sufficient demonstrations that if God had a people there whom he felt to especially bless the land would be a good land much to be desired. There is a good deal of vacant land in various parts of Gallelee and altoalso on the Jordan and on the other side in the country that Reuben, Gad & the half tribe of Manassa inherited. [##Deuteronomy 29:8##] This land may be obtained by ferman from the Sultan, and much easier if it can be had through the natives as we will be able to do, as the Turks are more or less afraid of foreignors.There is no price on land in Turkey. It is cheifly disposed off in Turkey as gifts and in order to obtain these land gifts, backshish, or money gifts are nessesary. The heaviest expences are here, hence we have no certainty how much it may cost. It will, however, not depend on the quantity of theLand only to advance the backshish.I have no idea that we can do much less than 30,000 dollars and it may take much more. And then it will take something to cover expences pending the transaction which generally takes 
 long in Turkey as they are a slow, easy-going people.First a permit would be nessesary to go to Palestine to locate land and to make the nessesary surveys.Then we would have to return to Constantinople to finish negotiations which would take some time because in obtaining land and title it would be nessesary to have our rights and privileges as a religious body properly defined.Should an effort on our part to build up the land of Israel at this time be right before the Lord and His servants, I would suggest that the Brethern appointed to locate lands and to negotiate for their purchase make it a point to be there about March or April, because the heat is oppressive in summer and the country almost impassable in the rainy season in the winter. Some time would also be necessary to obtain the nessesary papers from the Sultan & Sorte to travel and locate lands, for this reason time should be alowed from home in order to prevent rushing.For the good of the work of the Lord in the Orient, I would respectfully ask your earlyconsideration regarding this matter, as I do not see how we can do much there until we do something permanantly for the redemption of the Land of Israel and thus come into closer communication 
 with the people. There are many millions of peo-ple to whom we can testify, and for whom we cando much good if we become in closer contact with them; and then we could do much of the mission work with native help.I feel that a sufficient number of good familyies should be called from Zion to go to Palestine to settle permanantly & not expect to return very soon at any rate. The land is good and a land of promise, and I see nothing to which any one in terested in this great Latter-day-work could ofbject to so far as moving there to live is concerned. It will furnish a new and interesting feature in our mission work, and if honestly & faithfully engaged in cannot fail to bring down the smiles and approbations of our heavenly Father.In conclusion let me say I feel specially blessed and privileged in my labors and that I feel indevidually much benifited and hope God will give me grace to put it to good use.Praying God ever to bless you with His Holy Spirit and to protect you from all evil,and ever praying God to deliver His oppressed people, I am as alway your humble servant,F.

 Aintab, Turkey6th February 1890.To the Ffirst Presidency of the Church ofJesus Christ of Latter day Saints:Beloved Brethren,It becomes my painful duty to commnu-itcate to you the sor^r^owful news, that ourdear Brother in Christ, and fellow laborer,Elder Edgar D. Simmons, departed this life day before yesterday, Tuesday, ^the^ 4th of February 1890at 2 p.m. after sickness of 2 weeks, of which the last 8 days have been very painful.He died onf the small pocksx, his last moments,however, were peaceful. His voice began to failhim ^gradually^ during the last days of his sickness, and during the last day he was allmostunable to speak, but he was able to understandquestions put to him.This is a sorrowful event for the wholeChurch of Jesus Christ as also for the relativesof the deceased, but it is a consolation to us all, 
 that he died as a faithful member in thechurch of Jesus Christ.. The funeral tookplace yesterday, February 5th at 3 p.m. in theArmenian cemetery. The Protestant Priesttold Brother "Vezirian," that, provided wewished it so, he would speak at the services;and on account of my inability to make a speech in the Turkish language, I gave myconseant. At the a^p^pointed time he came, andafter the body was put in the coffin, he spokein the house as well as also afterwards at the grave.I have dressed our departed brother as wellas I had understanding to do, and ordered the coffin painted white. I found at thearrival of the coffin, that it was covered withwhite cloth, tacked all over it, and on the corners and edges were black strips and blackrosettes, fastened with brassheaded nails.On account of it being allready over the abovethe allotted time to keep a corpse, we had to hurry to put the body into the coffin, and left every thing the same way as described. 
 I do not the address of BrotherEdgar D. Simmons' relatives, therefore I ask you, the first Presidency of the Church, tokindly inform them as also likewise to express to them my best regards and condolence.It would have given me great satisfactionif Bro. Simmons could have returned tohis beloved ones at home, but God had ordained it otherwise. It was a hard time for the departed, because he had the malady inthe very worst degree.Just now I received a telegram from mystepfather G. Grau, at Haifa, ^Syria,^ to leave this place, and therefore, as fast ^soon^ as I can makeit possible to go, I shall do so, and will take Bro. Simmons' effects with me to Haifa, andhis relatives can write to me there their address and directions concerning his things.Please let this suffice, as theis letter has to be posted right away. My best regards to the first Presidency, hoping this letter may findYou all well. Your Brother in the GospelFriedrich Dieterle.address:HaifaSyria.

 Jaffa October 10, 1889SirWhilst I acknowledge the receipt of your welcome letter I regret to say that that letter did not remain long in my possession thinking it would be but right that my friend Mr Sjodahl shouldread its contents so that two days after I had received it I gave it to him for that purpose but to my great disappointment I learned from him few days after that he lost it and that he could n't tell how it happened but I attributed its loss to his having been very much engaged with several of the latter day Saints whoTo Wilford Woodruff, Esq[illegible]Salt Lake CityUtah 
 who had arrived about that time at Jaffa however I consolemyself for its temporal loss by entertaining a hope that you will kindly furnish me with a copy of the samePlease to accept my most sincere thanks for the book you kindly sentme of the life of Joseph Smith which lately and only lately I have begun to read having been prevented from doing so earlier by serious illness which lasted several weeks and even now I cannot fairly say I am quite convalescent but am glad to say that during all the time of my sufferings I always felt very happy and cheerful by the help of my Redeemer. I am also very thankful to the good MrSjodahl for having visited me often during my sickness. 
 You must have heard ere thisthat he with the aid of some of the Saints have Baptized about a fortnight ago two of my country-men who for a long time past are very desirous to go to Utah and if they could be pecuniarly helped in attaining that object I am fully persuaded that when they return they will be of great use not only to those who have been their benefactors but also to their own country-men. I was glad to hear that the scheme mentioned in my letter to you with regard to the establishment of a Colony and a mission in Palestine has ben set before you for consideration and should ever such a project be carried out I shall not only endeavorer to forward Your interest as much as liethin power but I hope to be 
 able also at the time to present you (as a gift) in virtue of a legal title Deed a suitable plot of ground for a cemetery for a Mission House and a garden joining it—Six Thousand square pics or ^about^ one and a half English acre would be necessary. The locality of the suggested Colony should not be farther than twelve of Fifteen miles from this TownThe price of land for building purposes varies according to situation and distance from the town of Jaffa for instance at a quarter miles' distance is from five shillings to ten shillingsthe square pic (a square picis equal to two thirds of an English yard farther on from one to five shillings from square pic. The prices here given are these of the land 
 which is situated on the South of Jaffa where Christians mostly liked for being the healthiest locality in the neighbourhoodThe price of land for a colony is from 35 to 50 Thirty Five to Fifty shilling each acre and I would before going further draw your attention to the fact that the Heads of the Christians Churches here are apt to make great difficulties and opposition to any new settlers coming here to buy lands in Palestine whatever their persuasion may be therefore these Prelates will be very injurious to the cause if they knew before hand what your purposes are consequently I would hereby suggest that if ever it should come to pass that you should decide to buy land here please to send out for the execution of the same one of 
 the latter day Saints known amongst you as being wise,cautious and discreet otherwise the whole plan (hoped for) will prove totally a failure but I think that if Mr Sjodahlshould remain in Palestine until such a time comes he would be just the person to carry it outPlease remember me kindly to all the Bishops Elders and Patriarch of your church and with kind regards to yourselfBelieve me to be Respectfully and most truly YoursM.
