Man also will have to be sealed to Man untill the chain is united from Father Adam down to the last saint this will be the work of the Millennium and Joseph Smith will be the Man to attend to it or to dictate it He will not administer in person But He will receive his resurrected Body and will dictate to those who dwell in the flesh and tell what  is to be done for He is the Last Prophet who is called to lay the  foundation of the great fullness of times  some have thought it strange what Adam But the period will come when this people of faithful will be willing to adopt Joseph Smith as their prophet seer Revelator and God But not the father of their spirits for that was our Father Adam Many questions are asked about divorces I will say that many men and women want to be sealed that should not be for they will not stay together.

Thus Ends 1869  and it has Been a vary important year in many respects The great National Highway, the Central  Pacific was built during this year also the Utah Central  Rail Road was Built from Salt Lake City The first  Rail Road Built By the Latter Day Saints and owned By Them, And  the first Rail Road Built in America. Built By working men  without Assistance from Government, or large capitalist, this  is Built By the Poor Saints and owned By them without assistance from  any one Expcept the Lord. This opens a communication wi  Between Salt Lake City and all the world. We Emigrated about 3000 Saints during this year. We have Lost during the past year One of our Number of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles Viz Albert Carrington was  Appointed in his stead. President G A. Smith  St Charles   ENDENTRY Washington County and President Brigham Young Preached during these Journies 43 Hours and 12 minutes according to the time I kept as recorded in my  Journal. We also Esstablished the Joint Merchantile Coop- eration as a general whole sale store also ward stores.  we have had sent unto us By the general Government the  most wicked set of Judges and all government officers that have Ever Been sent in Utah Territory, they are doing all they can to stir up the general Government to make war  war upon us and to destroy us from off the Earth. We have had some L. E. Harrison Eli B. Kelsey and some  others have Been cut off from the Church for Aposticy and  they have formed themselve into a New Church the same as other Apostates Have at different times and  they have Become Spiritualist and pretend to receive Rev- ilations. Wickedness is increasing throughout this  whole Nation and Exhertions are making to try to destroy  the kingdom of God. The Nations of the Earth are becoming  more and more fearful of the signs of the times and of the future  Events which await them. We have had peace in these  vallies since we came here as pioneers in 1847 with the Exception of the Buchannan war which cost the Nation  $40,000000 dollars and cost us 40 miles travel and Back again we have also had some Indians wars which has cost  some lives and considerable property. The wicked of this Nation are determined if possible to destroy and scatter  the saints during the year 1870 But the Saints are in the  Hands of God as they Ever have Been, and God will  defend them and fight their Battles if they will ownly be faithful and trust in him. 1870 will be an Eventful year in many respects. In fact Every year is Eventful  now in this fast age God has set his hand to Esstablish Zion and his Kingdom and he will accomplish in spite of  Earth and Hell, wicked men and devils He will overthrow  the wicked the, scorners, the Hipocritt, and unbelievers and save his Saints   ENDENTRY A Synopsis of my labors in 1869   I travelled 2172 Miles   I Attended 200 Meetings   I Preached 83 Discourses 83 discourses   I Attended 2 general Conferences 2 Conferences   I Attended Prayer Circles with Presidency and 12 22 Meeting   I Attended Prayer Circle with W.
