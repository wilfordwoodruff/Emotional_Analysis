 ELIJAH FARR,  ATTORNEY AT LAW,  OFFICE: Room 315 Utah Loan & Trust Bld'g.    Ogden, Utah, May 11 1894    Pres. Wilford Woodruff  Salt Lake City    I write for information in re-  gard to an alleged prophecy  made by Joseph Smith the phrophet  I notice in an edition of the   Doctrine and Covenants published  by S. W. Richards in Liverpool  in 1854. That there is no reference  made whatever ^relative^ to the commen-  icement of the late civil war  and that the prophecy is only  contained in editions sub-  sequent to the war.    The question has been recently  agitated in our religious meetings  and there has been no sattisf-  actory solution in accounting  for the omission of the prophecy  in the editions of the Doctrine & Covenants  previous to the war. Awaiting Yours respect,    I Remain Your Bro. in the Gosple    Elijah Farr 
 think it is very doubtful about its taking place very  soon, as the present King is very much opposed to it.  He think that the inhabitants of the Islands will be  considered no better than negros by Americans from the  fact that while traviling in the United States he was  once called a niger by some one that did not know him,  the King is about 21 years old but looks much older.  The laws of this Kingdom do not appear to be such, as the  necessities of the people require, but tend rather to promote  the very evils they were intended to prevent.    A word of councill or advice would be thankfuly received by  me, if  you could find the time & opportunity of writing.  Bro. Molen wishes to be remembered to you.    Praying that the blessings of the Lord may attend you  I subscribe myself respectfuly your Brother in  the Gospel    Edward Partridge    PS    I had like to have forgoten to mention my relatives  that reside upon these Islands. I saw my cousin  at Honolulu but did not have much conversation with  him, as he is quite deaf and did not appear very much  rejoiced to see me, my Aunt lives on this Island.  I have not been to see her yet, but shall in the cource  of a few weeks.    E. P. 
 6    show by our acts that we think ourselves above other men made in the image of God, then   we are offering an insult to man, and dishonor to God, which is a sin. I have never   received my endowments from no man, God gave me my endowments and the Keys of  knowledge and power, when I received the Gifts of the Holy Ghost. Have you lived   all these years, trusting in the things that others received? Instead of reaching forth your   hand by the power of faith and partake of the blessings of life freely, this was your priviledge.   The power that comes through the gifts of God would enable the Saints to stand valiant for   the work of God against all the temptations of the world, the flesh, and the devil, it would en-  able to discern between right and wrong in all things, and to seperate truth from error   wherever found. They would be known because their intelligence would shine forth,   as the stars of heaven, do upon the surrounding darkness, they would be the light of the world  and the salt of the earth.  They would attract the attention of all respectable people by   their undersanding, wisdom, love, mercy, justice, righteousness, truth, power, and  judgement. They would reign with God forever and ever, because they would be one   with Him and His Son Jesus Christ. What can you do with the promise of Joseph   the prophet that God would send one, to set His house in Order, this work is sadly needed now.  And again the promise as follows: "Behold I say unto you, the redemption of Zion must   needs come by power; therefore, I will raise up unto my people a man, who shall lead them  like as Moses led the Children of Israel," [##Doctrine and Covenants 103:16##] and so forth. I am pleading with you for the   restoreation of the original order of the house of God, and also the restoreation of the   same power and blessings, that was manifested in the administration of Jesus Christ,   and His Apostles in former days. How long do you suppose that you will be suffered by   the Almightly to stop His work to go forward on the earth? The reason for writeing to   you so plain and direct, is in order to penetrate the thick darkness, that has enveloped   the slumbering condition of your Souls. The Almighty has according to His mercy

I fear so much  for my mind for it is ^in^ a dreadful  state & it seems impossible to endure  it much longer unless the Lord  looks down in tender mercy upon  me & restores me to health; which   I have had faith He would do  for the sake of my helpless children  & because of long labor among the  children of the Saints which has con-  tinued more or less from the time  I was 15 yrs old.

 and goodness, promised to raise a man for your deliverance, from the bondage that you   have brought on yourselves through transgression. Will you continue to try to stop the ful-  fillment of the above promise? That would raise or lift you up out of the mass of corruption,   that has made itself manifest in the Church in this generation. If you have any portion   of the spirit of God abiding in you, then you will understand, and see the necessity of re-  ceiving the things I have written unto you, for these things are true and faithful, and will   stand forever. But if you do not receive these things and continue to hinder and stop the   work I have described to you, if this will be your course of action against the Lord,   you shall be mooved out of the way by Him. Yea and all the bitter and stifnecked ones   in the Church will if they do not repent be moved out of the way, even all the high, proud,   and exalted branches that produce nothing but wild grapes, they have drawn to them-  selves the substance and strength of the more humble vines in the vineyard of the Lord.   The Lord's time is at hand and nothing can remain to hinder Him. I ask you as   I would a father, to turn away from all that is evil, while there is a way open for   you. I desire in the name of Jesus Christ that this letter will be consecrated by the Almighty   for the salvation of many souls.    Respectfully David M. Williams   Malad City Idaho Ter.

I am   happy to say I enjoy excellent health;  I am still in the great City; I have been   delivering a course of lectures this winter;  we had 5,000 hand bills circulated, and   the meetings are well attended by stran-  gers, & some are believing, & obeying, I am   going to day to baptise. I have also sent   the proclamations to some of the members   of parliament as you commanded me; and   I intend to send it ^to^ more of them.   But I have never heard a whisper   from any source about what they think   of it. I seal them up in an letter   envellope & write their private address   with the word "private" on it, so I think   there can be no mistake but what they   recieve them in person

I am still in  possession of more valuable data  and facts which the Church would  be perfectly welcome to, were it  wanted for Church purposes alone;  but as I understand from your  letter already referred to that the  information is wanted for Bp    Whitney's history of Utah about to be  published, I think I am justly

 I have also been triming up the tree   in London.  we have cut off two or three   dozen dead snags, & are not quite done   yet.  We ^have^ already seen the good effects of   the triming. the Church is more united,  & strangers flock to hear, & listen   without being anoyed by bad mem-  bers. I expect to go to Birmingham for   a short time; Father Crook has got him  self into difficulty, with the gin, and   the women; the two greatest snares of the    unwary; he has run away to escape an   exposition. I expect to travel through   the country considerable this Summer  but not to leave London intirely   There is great excitement here about   war with America.

 Gentile valley Idaho July 29th 1882  Elders Woodruff, Richards, and others of the committee  considering the subject of Titles to church property.  As I find it a little uncertain whether I  shall be able to get back to committee meeting  on Tuesday as I intended, I beg to offer a few of my  reflections upon the subject of our church estates.  1st I will say that the former arrangements of circutitous  titles, through several individuals, was never in  my Judgement a very wise & safe arrangement  and has I fear in to many instances been poorly  carried out and is unsatisfactory to those persons  whose names are used in covering real estate.  and if the courts should investigate these affairs  they would be liable to be declared fraudulent  and void and involve many in difficulties.  2nd In view of the many difficulties surrounding  the whole questions, I am in favour of the Trustee  selling all real estate, not essential to Legitimate  ecclesisstical administration, such as church farms  and rented town property, turning it into pursonal

I was on the  point of following you when a rush of deputies  toward the door prevented, and I remained and  talked with Captain Greenman while his asso-  ciates were searching the premises. Ireland was  not among those who came to that building.  They were evidently ignorant of my presence in the  city and were not prepared with papers for me.  But I was told by a friend who was in their  confidence, that as soon as ^Mr.^ Ireland learned  of my being there, he hastened to the Clerk's office  to swear out a warrant.

The americans may flatter themselves & say   "they tried us twice, & failed" when Jonathin   was only only a boy, but now he is a man,   but it must be remembered that at that   time England was at war with France and   indeed with almost all Europe, now she is   comparitively at peace, & with a fleet   & army five times as formidable as in   the last war, & in case of a war now   America must feel her full strength.  and I am convinced they will be decievd  in the military arm of England.  The war will not be in oregon, but   England will strike at the verry vitals of   the nation, they will arm the slaves and   the Lamanites, & exert her utmuost streng-  th, at the onset, in order to consummate   the struggle, speedily.

 I have put away all foolish nonsense   of life and have retired into an Italian   village, called Giais-Selva, where the suitable   climate for orchards and the raising of fruit,  as also the utter retirement from the noise   of the world, corresponds with my feelings, and   where I have obtained my own property.  Here, at the foot of the Venetian Alps -- only   surrounded by peasants, I have found, that   the spirit of man gains that freshness and   strength necessary to distinguish Truth from Error.  To be short, I can say that the Church of Jesus   Christ of L. D.

I was very sorry that you was unable to  keep your Government officers there as their  report to the President here creates considerable   prejudice against you, they of course after  returning made as plausable a story as  possible in their part which report I pre-  sume you have seen as this.    We have nothing of interest worth com-  municating, Mrs. C's health is some better than   it has been. Father and the children are quite  well, and your friends generally here. Father  was much pleased with his letter.    Mrs. C. wishes to be kindly remembered to you,  Mrs. Woodruff and all of our friends in Utah,  hoping to see you soon when we shall have an   oppertunity of reviewing past occurences. I remain very Truely Yours    I. F. Carter    [sideways text] Dect. B. has not paid Gov. T's order, says he is expecting money from England  [end of sideways text] 
 DAY OF MEETING: EVERY ALTERNATIVE FRIDAY AT 12 o'C  J. DERRY  CLERK.    Lichfield Union.  Union Offices, Lichfield.  16 Sep: 1887.    Sir,    I shall feel greatly   obliged if you will kindly  send me, at the earliest  possible moment, a  certificate of the Marriage  of Thomas Cook and  Phillis Mary Bailye, which  took place at the Mormon  Church, Salt Lake City, on  or about the 20th October  1866.    The ceremony was  performed by Wilford 
 there would be many, who would join this   Church. There are also in Europe many   nice poor children -- (I could and would   adopt many.) my estate is large enough,   that many could live therein, food and   plain clothing costs not much; I would   bring them up in the spirit of the Latter day   Saints, would teach them in horticulture and   farming, in short, I would in a quiet and   practical way work for the ^interests of the^ Church of Jesus   Christ of Latter day Saints.    My residence is closed to everybody, I live   with an adopted child and one who shares   my ideas, entirely secluded; we produce for   ourselves everything necessary, and allow not   even a Servant (neither male nor female)  in the house, in order that we way live so,   as we choose to do.    It is a disgrace for the so called Republic   of North America ^to persecute^ the Church of J. C. of L. D. S.  so unjustly and to the detriment of all humanity.  If the Gentiles did not fear so much the   conquering power of Truth and Reason, they  would not have persecuted the Church of J. C.  of L. D. Saints so much and in such a manner,  as to defy all sense of justice.

If you base it upon the claim  that the kingdom was set up,  never more to be thrown down,   "his holiness"(?) has the advantage  of you there also, for the Lord  promised the former day church  that the gates of hell should not  prevail against it. We understand  this promise, and every other  one to be on condition of faith-  fulness on the part of the Church.    Joseph Smith said that 56  years would "wind up the scene,"

They have not yet arrived, but I doubt  not that they will be very fine indeed, as Utah has a reputation of  raising potatoes equal to any in the world.

 I was sorry to hear that there is so little dem  and for goods and at so reduced rates with you,  hope the market will improve, if for the best.    I have felt some anxiety about the result of   that investment as it might aid me materially  in getting this load off my shoulders and leave   me to act independently. I fear that affair with  Munroe will terminate disasterously, he represented  himself as being a partner of his Uncles (Col. Reis)   when he contracted to take your goods through. I   supposed of course that he was, a I should not  made any arrangements with him. I see by the  papers that he was shot this side of the valley,  if it is a possible thing to get the amount advanced  him a any part of it you will be likely to do it.  he wrote me a long letter before leaving Kanesville   stating his reasens for not taking the goods, that he  had waited some time for them and could learn  nothing of them, that when they did arrive his  teams were across the river and in their way  and it was entirely out of his power to forward  them at that late season of the year, and   that he would pay the money to you when   he arrived in the valley or soon after. I think   that if he had reached the Valley he would   have done something about it, but how it will

 How many Spirits are waiting, to clothe themselves  with mortality! oh what a Sinner am I,   to be 28 years old, and have not yet been   married, and brought forth an ofspring.  Like a heavy weight lies this sin upon   my soul, and I realize that, although perfectly   healthy, I am just as likely to be swept   away from life by an accident, and then   be doomed to live alone through the   immeasurable spaces of the creations.  In asmuch as I am healthy, well build   and young, I could have had many chances   to marry a Gentile girl, but I am very  careful, and SComparatively speaking well   experienced for my age, and know, that   habit and education make inextinguishable   marks upon mankind.  Even a young  Gentile girl of 17 or 18 years is so educated   in the ways of the Gentiles, that it might be   impossible for me, as husband even, to convert   her to the Church of Jesus Christ of L. D. Saints,  and if I would undertake to labor here in   Europe in the interests of said Church,

 be now is a matter of doubt with me. I will hope  for the best. As you advised me about those goods at   Kanesville I wrote to Elder Hyed to sell them if he   could do so without much loss. he writes me   since his return from the valley that the goods  are entirely different from what is sold in their   market, that they are much better and he thinks  he would not be able to get near the cost of them   at auction which is the only way he has of dispo  sing of them. in answer I instructed him to sell   them unless the sacrifice was [vicious], reserving   and forwarding to you one chest best quality im  perial tea, bag coffee and one [Bbc] sugar as you  directed. it will require some time to advertise  them and get them ready so that if I should   make up my mind to go out this spring, I can  get there before the sale takes place and un  less I hear something from you in the mean  time should not think of taking any across the  plains, it seems that such goods as those  ought to bring near their value, being neces  saries of life and in daily demand. Should   your market warrant a small invoice of goods  at any time you wish them sent please  inform me and it shall be attended to, those  now there I leave entirely discretional with   yourself together with this affair of Munroes.    Could a person with a small capital do any   thing at any kind if manufacturing at your place   do you think? please write me on the subject.

 such a spouse might even turn a Traitor,   and in that case the laws of Europe would   place power into her hands, to make it   mighty uncomfortable for me. Consequently   there are only two ways, either to adopt   a little girl ^without relatives,^ about 4 or 5 years, and bring   her up entirely excluded from all outside   controlle entirely in the spirit of the Church  of J. C. of L. D. Saints, and then, when arrived   at the suitable age, to be "sealed together,"   or else I would have to marry a girl   raised in Salt Lake City or in Utah, (or   two or three of them.)    I am fully convinced of the doctrine  of plurality, and after my emigration to   Utah and after my baptism into the Church,   (should it ever meet with Your consent,   most Reverend President,)I would not hesitate   to form a plurality in celestial marriage.

God is making another cove-  nant with his people, to take  the place of the one that has   been broken.    Christ has visited the Laman-  ites and has chosen a quorum  of twelve among them, to stay  at the head of the twelve tribes  when they shall be "raised up."  (See Isa. 49:6.)

 case would pass as relatives, cousins etc.  and You could depend on full secretiveness   on my part.    Perhaps it would be advisable for You to   send to my residence one of Your Swiss Missionaries,   so I could talk with him.    If it would be ^deemed^ advisable, I could come   at my own expense next Summer to Utah  and present myself to You, and I could   return after some months stay to Europe.  Should my proposed missionary labors   prove a failure, I could sell my estate  in Italy to emigrate for good to Utah.    Excuse me, Reverend Sir, I have poured   out my soul to You with enthusiasm and   truthfully.    On account of the importance of this   affair I beg You speedily for an answer  (please translate in the German language.)

Furthermore, an angel of God  appeared to me on evening  of the 4th of February 1891, just  before the scene was wound up,   and with a pen and ink, he  wrote the name of the Father  in my forehead in Hebrew  letters. (See Ezek. 9, & Rev. 7 & 14.)    Afterwards the Lord appeared to  me in a vision, and told me  to join myself to the Indian  movement.    But I am not to go alone.  He says in Isa. 49:8, "I will give  thee for a convenant of the peo-  ple." This is Israel (v. 3.) who was  to be given for a "light to the Gen-  tiles." (v. 6.)

Please do not rashly throw this  aside with contempt, until you have  accorded it a thoughtful perusal, when  I tell you that, just such a man as  the preceding paragraph calls for,  I claim to be.    To just such conclusions, as those  of Solomon, have I been forced.  I have no doubt that Solomon in  his day settled the disputes be-  tween the religious and irreligious  elements of his people by con-  vincing each of its necessity for  the other and according to each  its just deserts    Without religion civilization would  never have been; without skepticism  it never would have been very

 Claremont January 23rd, 1850    Brother Woodruff    Dear sir—Your kind favour came  duly to hand in due time, and I have carefully Examined  its contence, with pleasure—although much of the information  which it contains, I had already obtained, through the Fronteir  Gardian, and from other sources, for although I have been far  distant from the Saints, I have taken pains to keep myself  informed of their doings, and its gives me much pleasure  to here of there prosperity, at there newe home.    You ask me to settle up my bussness in the States and go  with you company to the Salt Lake next spring, if I  could see my way clear to do so, I think I should be  much inclined to make the attempt, but the situation of   my famely is such, together with my bussness affaies  that it will not be practible, for me to go for a yeare or  two yet, you may think by these Excuses that I do not intend  to Ever go, but if I know myself which I acknowlage is much  for a man to know, I do intend, to make anothr trial to  git an inheritance among the Saints, at some futer time  to myself yet unknown, my makeing the attempt once  has not dishartened me, although I was betrayed by  men, who I had fed & Lodged in my House, and made them  welcom, thinking I was doing the will of him who sees all  over 
 much: whilst the former predominates  civilization will rise, when the latter  gains the ascendency down she will  go again: we are evidently about the  turning point.    "There is a time to build up and  a time to tear down!"    Your people have suffered long & severe  ly are you ready to succor one who is prepared to succor you.    "The people will not hear without  a preacher; how can one preach ex-  cept he be sent" how can he produce  any great change if any existing so-  ciety send him and dictate to him  what he must say.    I am ready to assume the part that  the present situation demands but it  will impose upon me a condition  of mind closely bordering upon in-  sanity, one painful even to con-  template, hence for me to attempt   it without backing would be as great  folly as it would have been for  Columbus to have attempted his voy-  age of discovery in a bark canoe.

Still I was deceived  and cheated by them, but it has never changed my mind  as to the trouth of the principals which I imbrace, bad  men are to be found in all companys, and why not   among the Mormmons. You speak of my going to the  Valley to assist in starting Wooling Manufacturey, this branch   of Manufacture I am not acquainted with, and should be  but litle, if any better, of an account of my knowlege of Cotton  Manufacture, and I have not yet learned that cotton  can be raised in the Valley, and of coarse ^it^ would not be  practible to start cotton Machienry in a place whare  cotton could not be had. You speak of starting Iron  Foundres, and this branch of bussness I think will Eventually  succeed in that place, as Iron it is wanted in Every branch  of bussness, in its commencment, allmost Every thing can be made  of Iron—Rail Roads, Machinery of Every kind, Tools of all kinds, Dweling Houses  Meeting Houses &c &c.

Having  read of late in the Deseret News,  of the inconvenience and   unpleasantness attending the journey  of our people from New York to Salt  Lake City, and having had a number   of years experience in managing and   conducting excursion parties, also  being well acquainted with Railroad  matters in general, I felt that I  could offer a few suggestions that   would remedy the difficulties complained   of by our people, and would also be the   means of saving them considerable expense.

 New Orleans Oct 28th [18]45    Beloved Brother Woodruf    In compliance with your request at parting  with ^you^ for the land that all the Saints are so anxiouce to be gathe[r]ed  to. aAfter encountering many hardships and Trials in crossing the Atlantic  I can Fully rejoice and say that the Saints one and all are so  overjoyed now we are landed and about to move further up the River  from the City of Joseph I need not entrer into a detail of all the  ups and downs there is to encounter in crossing the sea you having gone  so many times back and forward upon the same Errand.  I find that Paitenc is in the greatest demand upon the Voiage  but upon the whole we have had pretty good health in  Generall with the exception of one famly. Some were sick  about a fortnight and then Recoved I think there was only  another and myself that was not sick through the whole  Voyage. the famly that was sick was Brother ^Wm^ Robinsons  famly they had the English Cholelera the little girl Ellen  died upon thursday night Oct 23rd and was Burried upon the Day  following. Brothe Robinsons wife continues very poorly but the famly  are all got well. We have had a pleasent and prosperr  passage. A great deal of fine wether and we all consider a  quick Voiage we arrived here from Loiverpool in six week and  three Days. I cannot describe to you the Joy and gladness of all  hearts when we beheld the land we had left our homes for  So that we might gather together to Build ^up^ the waste places  of Zion and help to lengthen her cords and strengthen her stakes  and prepare homes and shelters for all that sheuld come after us in  fullfillment of the same commands so that all things might be  gathered together in One and bring about the restitution of all things  which has been spoken by the mo^u^ths of all the holly prophets  Beloved Brother I wish I could but find Language to describe both the  feellings of the hearts of all the Brothers & Sisters there all so

Whilst it is no trouble for me to wade  deep into mathematics or what is more  trying still into the mysteries of the  metaphysical nature of man, I am so  helpless in the way of business that  were I thrown upon my own resourses  I expect I should starve or go mad.    There is certainly very little in me to  be proud of, nevertheless, weak as I  am, with my good wife's consent, I  have not the slightest fear of my  ability to down the doubting world  with its own weapons.    I have no idea of acting without my  wife's consent  I had better live and  die in peaceful obscurity "a quiet spec-  tator of this interesting scene".    We are not in abject poverty but  Mrs. F's health is quite indifferent  and we are slowly retrograding finan-  cially.    Under these circumstances I think a  few dollars per month paid to Mrs

 place the complaint.    The conductor, or agent, could also  make arrangements at suitable points  en-route, for the purchase of supplies,   provisions &c, and thus secure whole-  sale prices; by this means considerable  money could be saved the emigrants,  and also secure for them a better class  of supplies. The conductor being   posted at what points they would have  to change from one line to another,  could arrange to have the proper  number of cars ready for their  accommodation, by telegraphing  ahead, and thus save considerable  time, also in many other ways he  could make the trip pleasanter for  our people, and add to their comfort  and convenience.    You no doubt will readily see  the advantages that such an   arrangement would give our people.

 Washington May 8, 1852    Dear Brother,    I have had the pleasure of receiving   your favor of the 30th of January, and a kind   and encouraging letter from brother George   A.

"The effectual   fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much,"   and no one needs the prayers of the righteous   more than I do.

For the news I beg to refer   you to Governor Young. Enclosed you  have a receipt from the Hon John Appleton   agent of Messrs Sanbon & Carter.

 New York October 17, 1851    Dear Brother,    I have just now dilivered to   the agent of Mr Carter the money which   you sent by me. The foreign coin consisted  of one 20 frank, worth here $3.87, two ten guilders  and two five guilders worth $12.30 and one ten  dollar California piece, making in all $26.3017  andinsted of $26.80 as marked in the memoran-  dum. And ^I^ deeply regret to inform you  that ^the^ Deseret coin fell short on counting  it just ten dollars. The United States coin  was exactly right according to the momoran-  dum. The circumstance of the Deseret coin   not holding out annoys me very much;  The conveying of the money from your goodly  City to this place gave me a good deal  of anxiety, & I intended to charge Mr Carter   ten dollars for bringing it, but as it  fell short theI did not charge him any thing.  In the course of next month I expect to   recieve some money on tithing, and I  will then pay the order of President Young  for $1237.52. I should be glad to hear from  you, direct to Washington City. Please to excuse   haste. Make my kind regards to Sister Woodruff  and accept for yourself the ossurances of your friend  John M.

Wheelock called on me stating that you wished him to  collect such items relative to the incarceration and assassination  of Joseph Smith the Prophet and his brother Hiram the Patriarch,  as would be interesting to future generations, and gleaned  from those who accompanied them during the last  few days of their impriso^n^ment in the Carthage Jail.  And having had the privilege of remaining with them  nearly the entire time of their incarceration, I feel called  upon to state such facts as came under my own obser-  vation, as briefly and in as compact a shape as, in my  judgement, would make them both interesting and in-  telligable to the future reader: Bro. Wheelock having gone  some days ago; upon consideration, therefore, I concluded to  direct my statement to you in person, where it would  be safely preserved until wanted    By way of preface, I will begin my narative  by stating, that although I had been with the Prophet a  great deal since my first acquaintance with him; was in  his company and employ, in his office and in his store  over a year, and acted also at times as his private secre-  tary, ^but^ at the time of his going with Hiram to Carthage to  deliver themselves up for trial, I was at my farm some four  miles from Nauvoo with my family, and did not hear of  his movement for a day or so until Tuesday morning the

I saw two of them  last night. "Saul" the oldest & the one, says he must  have 125 first class cows the 15th of Nov. without  fail, if those are furnished he will give un  til next May for the bal. about 475. If they  are paid after May 1st they must have calves  with them. He would blike bro Tenney and I  to take the 475 for five years, by paying  double the number at the end of the five years.  We could take them if thought best and  thus get more time if you & the Brethren think  best. The 125 cows must be paid. Would it not  be best to have that number driven down  by some of the Brethren this fall. I am quite  sure bro Tenney cannot make the payment  & it is almost out of the question to expect  those poor people who have settled there, to  pay anything like that amount, and Bro J. N.

After din-  ner, of which Josep and Hiram partook, Captain Smith  (of the Carthage Greys)—the Magestrate—called the case of  Joseph and Hiram Smith for "riot", for examination; they  being considered as prisoners, togther with some fifteen of  the City Council and policemen, who were also prisoners;  all of whom, after every effort was made to prevent it,  on the part of the prosecution, succeeded in giving Bonds  to answer to the charges before the next circuit court.   I offered my name as Bondsman among others, and was   accepted; and I think I placed it on the prophet's Bond;  I distinctly recollect that his Bond called for more than  double the maximum of the liability in case of conviction;  this little incident confirmed it in my mind that   my name went on his Bond. They were then all dis-  charged. But this was hardly effected before a mit-  imus was served on Joseph and Hiram, and ^in^ it, the consta-  ble was directed to confine them both in jail, this  was alredy after dark. It is worthy of note, that they  had not yet been brought before the justice on the charge  of Treason, on which they were arrested, for examination,  The illegality of their imprisonment was therefore urged  by their Counsel, Esqr. Reed; but the Magistrate was Captain  of the mutinous "Carthage Greys", as well as Justice of the  Peace; so he had them forced to jail, notwithstanding the  protests of their counsel, or the Governor's pledge, and the  honor of the State that they should be protected from all illegality or violence. 
 OFFICE OF  J. J. WHITAKER,                            BUILDER.    Called to Tahiti    Ogden, Utah, April 12 1892    President Woodruff.  Salt Lake City.    Dear Brother:  I note with pleasure that  I should be thought worthy of being called  on a mission to preach the everlasting   ghosple; but my present circumstances  will not in any way permit me to take  the step at so early a date.    For the past few years, I have been engaged  in building; and just now, I have incurred  obligations that must be met—buildings  just begun which will take sometime  to complete.    About three years ago when I  was 19 yrs. of age I completed my  studies at the B. Y. A. and since then  have been working hard to obtain money  enough to further persue the same Studies

 and our feelings during our separation. But,  latterly, strange and ominous tidings of  persecutions, privations, bloody scenes, devastations  and of death in every shape have discursively  arrived, and, to heighten our expectations and  suspense to anxiety and fear, my absent  aunt has been long, long silent. Since a   little while previous to the at departure of  the Saints from Nauvoo, not a definite  word have we received either from her  or about her. At one time she is de-  clared dead, at another alive and married,  and then we are told she might have died of  fever, of ague, or of privations in the persecution,  and mights be's and might be's is all we hear,  which only serves to heighten our perplexity.  We have written letters, we have sent messages,  and we have made inquiries, and all this  fruitlessly. We know nothing beyond   conjecture, and therefore now appeal to  you as one who is most likely to be  a sure friend, and who, we believe, sincerely,  would exert himself in our behalf by  procuring the desired information. Can  you tell us what is become of her?  Is she dead or alive? Do the records  of the Church or the communications of 
 Smith has order on the Bishops, for more  than the tithing stock will come to. I Know  that nothing is expected of me in the matter  not even my suggestions, altho' you told me  when last we talked, to try & back up what  you had started—which I have tried faithfully  to do. Not one letter written by yourself, or,  any of the Brethren has even refered the peo-  ple to me in any matter, but on the contrary  things have been said, espicially in this rail-  road matter, which I consider some uncall-  ed for & unjust.    The contract first taken Bro. J. N. Smith A.  M. Tenney & myself were associated together as  partners. We took the work at 18¢ per cubic yd.  Waste & borrow. We have let it out to the people  at 15¢ furnishing them everything on the ground  with sna small advance above prices here & cost of  freight. We completed the organizations of the  Board of Trade at Snowflake & the prices were  set according to their sanction. Winter drawing  near bro Smith felt he must go in & build  for his family last from Utah. The Board of Trade  feel that bro Tenney & myself are the ones to take  the contracts & before bros Smith & Man his connector  left camp they with several of our best men  fixed the prices we are to pay the people in 
 for the present. I continued  to labor that way untill two  years past last September.   at which time I found myself  (owing to some severe financial  reverses) without Machine or  other resourses or revenues. in the  spring of 1882, I receive an order  to draw on the Tithing Office  in the amount two hundred  dollars per annum, on which I  have drawn at the rate of A  little over one dollar per day  for the actual time spent at  the Temple. as I have no mode  help, and as I have A family  of six souls,—two wives and  three small children—I find  the amount inadequate to  meet my absolute necessities,  as I have quit mixing business  since last september.

 Salt Lake City, Oct. 14 [18]80    Br Wilford Woodruff,    Dear Sir,    Br Hyrum Mikesell, a man  who has been with us a number of years, had  been employed by Br Brigham to work on the   Temple Block for five years. To work for  nothing and find himself; which he did  faithfully and got nothing in return. He  is very poor and broken. There are many  things pertaining to this case, which I will  not here mention; but your oft' repeated   declarations of your sense of justice and  magnanimity, prompts me to believe, that  you would acquiesce in, and even suggest  something to the Presidency, which would  induce them to render a little assistance to  Br Mikesell's family. It reminds me of the  Savour's Golden Rule.    I am prompted to take this step, because 
 I had the honor of being admitted into the jail with  the prisoners that night; we were ushered into the  lower north room, where there was no bed, cot,  or chair that I can recall to mind, and here, if I  recollect aright, we spent the night ^amusing ourselves^ as best we could.    The next morning the gentlemanly jailor called  us to breakfast; and after partaking with him and  family of a well prepared meal, he conducted us  into an upper room, being the South East room, in  which the prisoners, Joseph, Hiram, and bro. Taylor were   afterwards shot.    The party thus imprisoned were, the prophet,  his brother Hiram, John Taylor, Dr. Willard Richards,  Stephen Markham, I think Dan Jones, and a gentle-  man friend from Texas, whose name I have forgotten,  and (myself) John S. Fullmer.    It was on wednesday the 26th that the Governor redeemed  his pledge to give "General Smith" a personal interview. This he  did in company of a friend of his, when the prophet, like  Paul, had the privilege of answering for himself. He rehearsed  all the detailes of the causes which led to the present crisis;  reminded his Excellency that "the question in dispute was a  civil matter, and, to settle which, needed no resort to  arms, and that he was at any time, and had always  been, ready to answer to any charge in the premises that  might be preferred against him, either as Mayor of the  City, or as a private individual, in any Court of Justice,  unintimidated by a mob or military array, and make  all the satisfaction that the laws required, if any," &c.  His Excellency stated that he "had not called out the force at hand

We afterwards learned that he designed to march  his troops, (that is, those who had assembled for mobocratic  purposes, and ^in the place of dismissing and rebuking them,^ whom he had mustered into service) into Nauvoo  to gratify them, and that the prisoners should accompany   them, and then return again to attend a trial before  the said magistrate already refered to. Several hours  after the interview mentioned, an officer arrived with a  requision from the Magistrate then in Court, for the  two prisoners, Joseph and Hiram to forthwith appear before  his Hon's court on the charge of Treason; their counsel  plead, that as they had been imprisoned, the examination  would be informal, and therefore they were not bound to  appear. A posse soon afterwards appeared, headed by  Lieutenant Worrel; opened a hollow Square with fixed  bayonets, before the door of the prison, and demanded  the prisoners, with a stern, defiant mien: Joseph hesitated;  Hiram took him by the arm, saying, there is no getting  round it, Joseph, we had better go. They walked down  staires arm in arm into the hollow square which  closed as soon as they had entered; according to my recol-  lection no one else was admitted into that square; in that  manner they were quickly marched into the ^court^ house, where  Captain Smith of the Carthage Greys held his court.  Apostles Dr. Richards and John Taylor, who is now the Pres-  ident of the Church, also Stephen Markham and myself,  ^remained^ in attendance the whole time

 The prisoners having no witnesses on hand, preparatory  for trial, their counsellor Esqr. Reed claimed, and with  difficulty succeeded in obtaining time until next day  noon, to subpoena some two dozen witnesses in Nauvoo,  and have them in Carthage by that time; it being already  about five o'clock p.m. The prisoners were accordingly re-  manded to prison again; the Brethren, Richards, Taylor,  Markham and myself still remained with them. I had  secreted a single barrel pocket pistol, about six inches in  length, silver mounted, which I carried unobserved in my  boot top, and after arriving in the jail, I handed it to Brother  Joseph for his protection if necessary. My attention was  called to it several times by Bro. Geo. A. Smith in the Historian's  Office, and I recognised it as the identical one I handed  to the prophet. We remained that night in the same  room that we had been occupying. In retiring to rest for  the night, two of those present, I think they were Dr.  Richards and Bro. Hiram Smith occupied the bed which  stood in the south east corner of the room, Joseph  declined to occupy it, although pressed to do so. He laid  down on the floor side by side with the rest of the  brethren; he lying on the east side of the row as they  were down, their heads to the south against the wall;  He asked me to lay down by his side; he stretched out  his right arm and told me to lay my head upon it,  which I did, feeling grateful for the privelege, but  which I esteem since his martyrdom as one of the greatest  privileges of my life. He encircled me in his arm, and we  engaged for a length of time in low conversation upon private  affairs and the circumstances we were then passing through;
