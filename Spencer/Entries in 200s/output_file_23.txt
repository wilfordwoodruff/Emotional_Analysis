Pardon me for intruding on your  valuable time and perhaps wearying  your patience, but I feel that I  must yet have advice from you  before deciding the matter in regard  to the Samoan Mission. In order  that you may be the better able to  decide I will make a plain state- ment of our affairs and then act  according to your decision.  In November our baby died, that being  the second time we had been bereaved, and having no other children; soon  after came letters in regard to the  mission and in my intense sorrow  ENDENTRY I think bro. Seegmiller should get his endowment before he goes on his mission.

As to finance,  my husband has now recieved pay  for his winters work, and after  paying all his debts is in posses- sion of about $100 in cash.  We own our home, a small place  worth about $500, what little  furniture we have in it and a  cow, and these constitute our  worldly possessions. I do not think we could sell the place even if we  were to try, but might perhaps  rent it for three or four dollars  per month. Could we do so that  would be our only income.

Doubtless you will remember last September I received a letter of inquiery in relation to me filling a Mission to my native home Switzerland I frankly laid before you the circonstances of my aged Mother, invalid Sister and also fully explained the course I propose to persue Vis: get my Mother confortably situated, save money and depart abroad, soon after this a New feature made its appearance, vis my wife infedelity, her marriage etc., the abuse of the new  husband to my two children etc. I wrote fully to you all of the aforesaid Circonstances.  Now I have worked exceedingly hard and have on hand to day something like $90 or $100 to start on, and see me through my mission, which amount will barely carry me to my field of Labor.  Brethren, I dont by any means wish to be understood as offering the foregoing as excuses, for God knows I desire to honorably fill my mission, the only trouble is as you see, my own flesh and blood are apparantly left to the mercy of a Cold hearted people. If I send $100 as suggested in the letter Enclosed, this leaves me without one Cent to proceed to preach the Gospel. ENDENTRY W. A. Head 27 Feb. 1892 Recd 29 Feb. 1892  Accepts Mission ENDENTRY E. A.

Dear Sir:  The object of this letter is to inquire if in the service of the Church or in your own individual service there is a position vacant which you wish to fill with a man on whose ability, fideli- ty, courage and integrity you can always rely?  If so, to respect- fully request that you consider me an applicant. If there is not any way which I can serve you here, I shall be pleased to come to Salt Lake City or to go to any place which you may direct.  I am a young man, 27 years old; have been a student at the Johns Hopkins University, and am a graduate of the Law Dept. of the  University of Maryland.  I am at present employed, but my position is in many ways not congeniel, but being dependent upon it and having a mother to look after, has in a great measure precluded me from securing another situation more suited to my taste.  In the event of employing me, there is no doubt but that you will find me valuable to you. I do not say this is the spirit of conceit, but because I know that a man of any ability, who is an honorable man, as I trust I am; and who will be as loyal to your interests as I shall be, is always a valuable man.  If you decide to give me a trial, I shall give you satisfacto- ry reference as to my character, mental qualifications andc.  I solicit your careful consideration for the above, and am sat- isfied if you decide to take me into your service that you will not regret having done so.

He cannot correspond very well in English so I promised to write for him.  His financial circumstances are such that he cannot arrange to go just now, nor would I deem it wise to urge him to go at present.
