 ELIJAH FARR,ATTORNEY AT LAW,OFFICE: Room 315 Utah Loan & Trust Bld'g.Ogden, Utah, May 11 1894Pres. Wilford WoodruffSalt Lake CityI write for information in re-gard to an alleged prophecymade by Joseph Smith the phrophetI notice in an edition of the Doctrine and Covenants publishedby S. W. Richards in Liverpoolin 1854. That there is no referencemade whatever ^relative^ to the commen-icement of the late civil warand that the prophecy is onlycontained in editions sub-sequent to the war.The question has been recentlyagitated in our religious meetingsand there has been no sattisf-actory solution in accountingfor the omission of the prophecyin the editions of the Doctrine & Covenantsprevious to the war. Awaiting Yours respect,I Remain Your Bro. in the GospleElijah Farr 
 think it is very doubtful about its taking place verysoon, as the present King is very much opposed to it.He think that the inhabitants of the Islands will beconsidered no better than negros by Americans from thefact that while traviling in the United States he wasonce called a niger by some one that did not know him,the King is about 21 years old but looks much older.The laws of this Kingdom do not appear to be such, as thenecessities of the people require, but tend rather to promotethe very evils they were intended to prevent.A word of councill or advice would be thankfuly received byme, if  you could find the time & opportunity of writing.Bro. Molen wishes to be remembered to you.Praying that the blessings of the Lord may attend youI subscribe myself respectfuly your Brother inthe GospelEdward PartridgePSI had like to have forgoten to mention my relativesthat reside upon these Islands. I saw my cousinat Honolulu but did not have much conversation withhim, as he is quite deaf and did not appear very muchrejoiced to see me, my Aunt lives on this Island.I have not been to see her yet, but shall in the courceof a few weeks.E.

 6show by our acts that we think ourselves above other men made in the image of God, then we are offering an insult to man, and dishonor to God, which is a sin. I have never received my endowments from no man, God gave me my endowments and the Keys ofknowledge and power, when I received the Gifts of the Holy Ghost. Have you lived all these years, trusting in the things that others received? Instead of reaching forth your hand by the power of faith and partake of the blessings of life freely, this was your priviledge. The power that comes through the gifts of God would enable the Saints to stand valiant for the work of God against all the temptations of the world, the flesh, and the devil, it would en-able to discern between right and wrong in all things, and to seperate truth from error wherever found. They would be known because their intelligence would shine forth, as the stars of heaven, do upon the surrounding darkness, they would be the light of the worldand the salt of the earth.  They would attract the attention of all respectable people by their undersanding, wisdom, love, mercy, justice, righteousness, truth, power, andjudgement. They would reign with God forever and ever, because they would be one with Him and His Son Jesus Christ. What can you do with the promise of Joseph the prophet that God would send one, to set His house in Order, this work is sadly needed now.And again the promise as follows: "Behold I say unto you, the redemption of Zion must needs come by power; therefore, I will raise up unto my people a man, who shall lead themlike as Moses led the Children of Israel," [##Doctrine and Covenants 103:16##] and so forth. I am pleading with you for the restoreation of the original order of the house of God, and also the restoreation of the same power and blessings, that was manifested in the administration of Jesus Christ, and His Apostles in former days. How long do you suppose that you will be suffered by the Almightly to stop His work to go forward on the earth? The reason for writeing to you so plain and direct, is in order to penetrate the thick darkness, that has enveloped the slumbering condition of your Souls. The Almighty has according to His mercy

I fear so muchfor my mind for it is ^in^ a dreadfulstate & it seems impossible to endureit much longer unless the Lordlooks down in tender mercy uponme & restores me to health; which I have had faith He would dofor the sake of my helpless children& because of long labor among thechildren of the Saints which has con-tinued more or less from the timeI was 15 yrs old.

 and goodness, promised to raise a man for your deliverance, from the bondage that you have brought on yourselves through transgression. Will you continue to try to stop the ful-fillment of the above promise? That would raise or lift you up out of the mass of corruption, that has made itself manifest in the Church in this generation. If you have any portion of the spirit of God abiding in you, then you will understand, and see the necessity of re-ceiving the things I have written unto you, for these things are true and faithful, and will stand forever. But if you do not receive these things and continue to hinder and stop the work I have described to you, if this will be your course of action against the Lord, you shall be mooved out of the way by Him. Yea and all the bitter and stifnecked ones in the Church will if they do not repent be moved out of the way, even all the high, proud, and exalted branches that produce nothing but wild grapes, they have drawn to them-selves the substance and strength of the more humble vines in the vineyard of the Lord. The Lord's time is at hand and nothing can remain to hinder Him. I ask you as I would a father, to turn away from all that is evil, while there is a way open for you. I desire in the name of Jesus Christ that this letter will be consecrated by the Almighty for the salvation of many souls.Respectfully David M. Williams Malad City Idaho Ter.

 I have also been triming up the tree in London.  we have cut off two or three dozen dead snags, & are not quite done yet.  We ^have^ already seen the good effects of the triming. the Church is more united,& strangers flock to hear, & listen without being anoyed by bad mem-bers. I expect to go to Birmingham for a short time; Father Crook has got himself into difficulty, with the gin, and the women; the two greatest snares of the  unwary; he has run away to escape an exposition. I expect to travel through the country considerable this Summerbut not to leave London intirely There is great excitement here about war with America. The English aredetermind never to yield their claim to Oregon.  They say if the American govern-ment cannot protect her own citisens it ought to ^be^ broken to attoms, & framed anew, & they are prepared to do it.And although the Americans may notbe aware of the fact, it is nevertheless true that John Bull has at this

 I have put away all foolish nonsense of life and have retired into an Italian village, called Giais-Selva, where the suitable climate for orchards and the raising of fruit,as also the utter retirement from the noise of the world, corresponds with my feelings, and where I have obtained my own property.Here, at the foot of the Venetian Alps -- only surrounded by peasants, I have found, that the spirit of man gains that freshness and strength necessary to distinguish Truth from Error.To be short, I can say that the Church of Jesus Christ of L. D. Saints is the only true religion for humanity in this time and age of the world,that ^said^ Church must be victorious in the end and I can foresee that the time is not far, when she will come out conqueror over the Gentiles.I have the plan or scheme, to work here in Europe, here on my Estate, quietly in the interests of the Church of Jesus Christ of L.

 there would be many, who would join this Church. There are also in Europe many nice poor children -- (I could and would adopt many.) my estate is large enough, that many could live therein, food and plain clothing costs not much; I would bring them up in the spirit of the Latter day Saints, would teach them in horticulture and farming, in short, I would in a quiet and practical way work for the ^interests of the^ Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints.My residence is closed to everybody, I live with an adopted child and one who shares my ideas, entirely secluded; we produce for ourselves everything necessary, and allow not even a Servant (neither male nor female)in the house, in order that we way live so, as we choose to do.It is a disgrace for the so called Republic of North America ^to persecute^ the Church of J. C. of L. D. S.so unjustly and to the detriment of all humanity.If the Gentiles did not fear so much the conquering power of Truth and Reason, theywould not have persecuted the Church of J. C.of L. D.

As you advised me about those goods at Kanesville I wrote to Elder Hyed to sell them if he could do so without much loss. he writes me since his return from the valley that the goodsare entirely different from what is sold in their market, that they are much better and he thinkshe would not be able to get near the cost of them at auction which is the only way he has of disposing of them. in answer I instructed him to sell them unless the sacrifice was [vicious], reserving and forwarding to you one chest best quality imperial tea, bag coffee and one [Bbc] sugar as youdirected. it will require some time to advertisethem and get them ready so that if I should make up my mind to go out this spring, I canget there before the sale takes place and unless I hear something from you in the meantime should not think of taking any across theplains, it seems that such goods as thoseought to bring near their value, being necessaries of life and in daily demand. Should your market warrant a small invoice of goodsat any time you wish them sent pleaseinform me and it shall be attended to, thosenow there I leave entirely discretional with yourself together with this affair of Munroes.Could a person with a small capital do any thing at any kind if manufacturing at your place do you think? please write me on the subject.I recd a letter (an interesting one) from Sarah E.short time since and will write to some ofthe family soon. I recd. a letter a few days sincefrom Calvin, he was well ad has recd a letter fromsome of the family so that he knows they are there.please say to Mrs. W. that I shall write to her assoon as she answers my last and perhaps before. hopethat little girl grows well Mouther wishes to be very kindly remembered to Ms. W. yourself and all our friendsthere will write when she feels able much love to alllet us hear from you often I.

 such a spouse might even turn a Traitor, and in that case the laws of Europe would place power into her hands, to make it mighty uncomfortable for me. Consequently there are only two ways, either to adopt a little girl ^without relatives,^ about 4 or 5 years, and bring her up entirely excluded from all outside controlle entirely in the spirit of the Churchof J. C. of L. D. Saints, and then, when arrived at the suitable age, to be "sealed together," or else I would have to marry a girl raised in Salt Lake City or in Utah, (or two or three of them.)I am fully convinced of the doctrineof plurality, and after my emigration to Utah and after my baptism into the Church, (should it ever meet with Your consent, most Reverend President,)I would not hesitate to form a plurality in celestial marriage.Here in Europe I pass as a German, residing in Italy, in a village, entirely stranger to everybody -- nobody ^would^ Knows anything about my family affairs, and my wives in that

 Claremont January 23rd, 1850Brother WoodruffDear sir—Your kind favour cameduly to hand in due time, and I have carefully Examinedits contence, with pleasure—although much of the informationwhich it contains, I had already obtained, through the FronteirGardian, and from other sources, for although I have been fardistant from the Saints, I have taken pains to keep myselfinformed of their doings, and its gives me much pleasureto here of there prosperity, at there newe home.You ask me to settle up my bussness in the States and gowith you company to the Salt Lake next spring, if Icould see my way clear to do so, I think I should bemuch inclined to make the attempt, but the situation of my famely is such, together with my bussness affaiesthat it will not be practible, for me to go for a yeare ortwo yet, you may think by these Excuses that I do not intendto Ever go, but if I know myself which I acknowlage is muchfor a man to know, I do intend, to make anothr trial togit an inheritance among the Saints, at some futer timeto myself yet unknown, my makeing the attempt oncehas not dishartened me, although I was betrayed bymen, who I had fed & Lodged in my House, and made themwelcom, thinking I was doing the will of him who sees allover 
 much: whilst the former predominatescivilization will rise, when the lattergains the ascendency down she willgo again: we are evidently about theturning point."There is a time to build up anda time to tear down!"Your people have suffered long & severely are you ready to succor one who is prepared to succor you."The people will not hear withouta preacher; how can one preach ex-cept he be sent" how can he produceany great change if any existing so-ciety send him and dictate to himwhat he must say.I am ready to assume the part thatthe present situation demands but itwill impose upon me a conditionof mind closely bordering upon in-sanity, one painful even to con-template, hence for me to attempt it without backing would be as greatfolly as it would have been forColumbus to have attempted his voy-age of discovery in a bark canoe.Continued on page [2]

 Washington May 8, 1852Dear Brother,I have had the pleasure of receiving your favor of the 30th of January, and a kind and encouraging letter from brother George A. Smith and yourself, dated February 29th.I am gratified to learn that I am con-stantly remembered before the Lord. "The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much," and no one needs the prayers of the righteous more than I do. My time is much occupied that I am obliged to write briefly, but I hope that both of you will continue to write me frequently, even if I should not find leisure to answer you. For the news I beg to refer you to Governor Young. Enclosed youhave a receipt from the Hon John Appleton agent of Messrs Sanbon & Carter.Mr Mayor Grant is still in New York, but will probably leave there next week on hisreturn to the "far west." Mr Clay has not, I think been in the Senate Chamber since the commencement of the present session, and he 
 New York October 17, 1851Dear Brother,I have just now dilivered to the agent of Mr Carter the money which you sent by me. The foreign coin consistedof one 20 frank, worth here $3.87, two ten guildersand two five guilders worth $12.30 and one tendollar California piece, making in all $26.3017andinsted of $26.80 as marked in the memoran-dum. And ^I^ deeply regret to inform youthat ^the^ Deseret coin fell short on countingit just ten dollars. The United States coinwas exactly right according to the momoran-dum. The circumstance of the Deseret coin not holding out annoys me very much;The conveying of the money from your goodlyCity to this place gave me a good dealof anxiety, & I intended to charge Mr Carter ten dollars for bringing it, but as itfell short theI did not charge him any thing.In the course of next month I expect to recieve some money on tithing, and Iwill then pay the order of President Youngfor $1237.52. I should be glad to hear fromyou, direct to Washington City. Please to excuse haste. Make my kind regards to Sister Woodruffand accept for yourself the ossurances of your friendJohn M. Bernhisel

 25th June, and then that he and others had gone to Car-thage on the day before; I immediately mounted myhorse and hastened to Carthage, alone; I arrived at Ham-ilton's tavern just as dinner was announced. After din-ner, of which Josep and Hiram partook, Captain Smith(of the Carthage Greys)—the Magestrate—called the case ofJoseph and Hiram Smith for "riot", for examination; theybeing considered as prisoners, togther with some fifteen ofthe City Council and policemen, who were also prisoners;all of whom, after every effort was made to prevent it,on the part of the prosecution, succeeded in giving Bondsto answer to the charges before the next circuit court. I offered my name as Bondsman among others, and was accepted; and I think I placed it on the prophet's Bond;I distinctly recollect that his Bond called for more thandouble the maximum of the liability in case of conviction;this little incident confirmed it in my mind that my name went on his Bond. They were then all dis-charged. But this was hardly effected before a mit-imus was served on Joseph and Hiram, and ^in^ it, the consta-ble was directed to confine them both in jail, thiswas alredy after dark. It is worthy of note, that theyhad not yet been brought before the justice on the chargeof Treason, on which they were arrested, for examination,The illegality of their imprisonment was therefore urgedby their Counsel, Esqr. Reed; but the Magistrate was Captainof the mutinous "Carthage Greys", as well as Justice of thePeace; so he had them forced to jail, notwithstanding theprotests of their counsel, or the Governor's pledge, and thehonor of the State that they should be protected from all illegality or violence.

 and our feelings during our separation. But,latterly, strange and ominous tidings ofpersecutions, privations, bloody scenes, devastationsand of death in every shape have discursivelyarrived, and, to heighten our expectations andsuspense to anxiety and fear, my absentaunt has been long, long silent. Since a little while previous to the at departure ofthe Saints from Nauvoo, not a definiteword have we received either from heror about her. At one time she is de-clared dead, at another alive and married,and then we are told she might have died offever, of ague, or of privations in the persecution,and mights be's and might be's is all we hear,which only serves to heighten our perplexity.We have written letters, we have sent messages,and we have made inquiries, and all thisfruitlessly. We know nothing beyond conjecture, and therefore now appeal toyou as one who is most likely to bea sure friend, and who, we believe, sincerely,would exert himself in our behalf byprocuring the desired information. Canyou tell us what is become of her?Is she dead or alive? Do the recordsof the Church or the communications of

Not one letter written by yourself, or,any of the Brethren has even refered the peo-ple to me in any matter, but on the contrarythings have been said, espicially in this rail-road matter, which I consider some uncall-ed for & unjust.The contract first taken Bro.

 Salt Lake City, Oct. 14 [18]80Br Wilford Woodruff,Dear Sir,Br Hyrum Mikesell, a manwho has been with us a number of years, hadbeen employed by Br Brigham to work on the Temple Block for five years. To work fornothing and find himself; which he didfaithfully and got nothing in return. Heis very poor and broken. There are manythings pertaining to this case, which I willnot here mention; but your oft' repeated declarations of your sense of justice andmagnanimity, prompts me to believe, thatyou would acquiesce in, and even suggestsomething to the Presidency, which wouldinduce them to render a little assistance toBr Mikesell's family. It reminds me of theSavour's Golden Rule.I am prompted to take this step, because 
 I had the honor of being admitted into the jail withthe prisoners that night; we were ushered into thelower north room, where there was no bed, cot,or chair that I can recall to mind, and here, if Irecollect aright, we spent the night ^amusing ourselves^ as best we could.The next morning the gentlemanly jailor calledus to breakfast; and after partaking with him andfamily of a well prepared meal, he conducted usinto an upper room, being the South East room, inwhich the prisoners, Joseph, Hiram, and bro. Taylor were afterwards shot.The party thus imprisoned were, the prophet,his brother Hiram, John Taylor, Dr. Willard Richards,Stephen Markham, I think Dan Jones, and a gentle-man friend from Texas, whose name I have forgotten,and (myself) John S. Fullmer.It was on wednesday the 26th that the Governor redeemedhis pledge to give "General Smith" a personal interview. This hedid in company of a friend of his, when the prophet, likePaul, had the privilege of answering for himself. He rehearsedall the detailes of the causes which led to the present crisis;reminded his Excellency that "the question in dispute was acivil matter, and, to settle which, needed no resort toarms, and that he was at any time, and had alwaysbeen, ready to answer to any charge in the premises thatmight be preferred against him, either as Mayor of theCity, or as a private individual, in any Court of Justice,unintimidated by a mob or military array, and makeall the satisfaction that the laws required, if any," &c.His Excellency stated that he "had not called out the force at hand

For teams from 4$ to 5$per day they furnesh themselves at a cost of about$1050 per week. Men from 1$ to 2$ per day andboard. Those prices are almost double what othercontractors are paying.

Several hoursafter the interview mentioned, an officer arrived with arequision from the Magistrate then in Court, for thetwo prisoners, Joseph and Hiram to forthwith appear beforehis Hon's court on the charge of Treason; their counselplead, that as they had been imprisoned, the examinationwould be informal, and therefore they were not bound toappear. A posse soon afterwards appeared, headed byLieutenant Worrel; opened a hollow Square with fixedbayonets, before the door of the prison, and demandedthe prisoners, with a stern, defiant mien: Joseph hesitated;Hiram took him by the arm, saying, there is no gettinground it, Joseph, we had better go. They walked downstaires arm in arm into the hollow square whichclosed as soon as they had entered; according to my recol-lection no one else was admitted into that square; in thatmanner they were quickly marched into the ^court^ house, whereCaptain Smith of the Carthage Greys held his court.Apostles Dr. Richards and John Taylor, who is now the Pres-ident of the Church, also Stephen Markham and myself,^remained^ in attendance the whole time

 The prisoners having no witnesses on hand, preparatoryfor trial, their counsellor Esqr. Reed claimed, and withdifficulty succeeded in obtaining time until next daynoon, to subpoena some two dozen witnesses in Nauvoo,and have them in Carthage by that time; it being alreadyabout five o'clock p.m. The prisoners were accordingly re-manded to prison again; the Brethren, Richards, Taylor,Markham and myself still remained with them. I hadsecreted a single barrel pocket pistol, about six inches inlength, silver mounted, which I carried unobserved in myboot top, and after arriving in the jail, I handed it to BrotherJoseph for his protection if necessary. My attention wascalled to it several times by Bro. Geo. A. Smith in the Historian'sOffice, and I recognised it as the identical one I handedto the prophet. We remained that night in the sameroom that we had been occupying. In retiring to rest forthe night, two of those present, I think they were Dr.Richards and Bro. Hiram Smith occupied the bed whichstood in the south east corner of the room, Josephdeclined to occupy it, although pressed to do so. He laiddown on the floor side by side with the rest of thebrethren; he lying on the east side of the row as theywere down, their heads to the south against the wall;He asked me to lay down by his side; he stretched outhis right arm and told me to lay my head upon it,which I did, feeling grateful for the privelege, butwhich I esteem since his martyrdom as one of the greatestprivileges of my life. He encircled me in his arm, and weengaged for a length of time in low conversation upon privateaffairs and the circumstances we were then passing through;
