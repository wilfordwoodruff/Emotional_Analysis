In the chain of valleys that lies across the breast of Utah and Idaho, there are none fairer than Cache. No other valleys within the Territory or State can show such verdant hills, such sparkling streams, such fertile soil. To describe its won- derful and picturesque surroundings requires time and space not at the disposal of the writer. Suffice it to say that a fairer spot, more varied scenery or finer climate exists not on the face of the earth. The Valley is an oblong basin, of which the Wasatch mountains form the rim. It is 15 miles in width, and 60 miles in length, 4200 feet above the level of the sea, can cultivate a hundred thousand acres, and supports a population of 20,000 souls. There are more than a dozen towns and villages presented to view, each having from one to three thousand inhabitants, Logan, the county seat, being the largest, with over six thousand. Cache Valley is first above all other western places; the climate is all that be desired, short, mild winters and the balance of the year such as cannot be surpassed. For fruit this valley cannot be beat for flavor, quality, quantity, size or productiveness, and the finest wheat is raised here without irrigation, yielding heavy crops. Onyx and all the precious metals are in the surrounding mountains and  for investments in real estate this Valley cannot be excelled. Cache Valley has at present but one railroad, the Union Pacific. The academy in the  northern part of the valley, built by the people of Oneida Co., is a noble institution and worthy of patronage. All lines of business are represented, such as lumber yards, planing mills, flouring mills (roller process), machine shops, mercantile of every description, the finest creamery and cheese factories in the west, the best show and plow factories, nurseries, etc., The only Woolen Factory in Idaho is located at Franklin, where is being turned out a class of yarns, blankets and linseys, etc., that is not excelled in the east or west in quality or price. To the tourist and health seeker we say come and enjoy this wonderful land, that has not a peer for beauty and healthfulness, and for those seeking investment and homes where all the blessings of life can be en- joyed without a single drawback, we say come and you will never seek further. Letters of inquiry addressed to any of the advertisers on the back of this will receive a prompt reply.  The Oneida Mercantile Union, DEALERS IN GENERAL MERCHANDISE.

There is a  medical school in Louisville, Ky that opens on Feby 1st at which I would like to take my first years course. It will coust me about $30000/100 for this  year. Although I have some realty at Logan, I  cannot well despose of it or give it as security at presant without considerable ^loss^ or expense. If you can  assist me to^in^ getting about $300.00/100 for six or eight months at reasonable inte^r^est, it would greatly oblige me. Previous to going on my mission, I was book- keeping and clerking for W. C. Morris, who is now deceased. At presant I have no work and would ENDENTRY to the property. I am in this land for the express purpose of making a home FIGURES and I want a good foundation to build that house on it.  I am fully prepared to remit in full, any time you will endow ^endow^ some person here with authority to transact the bussiness.  I trust this will meet with your aproval, and that I will reci^e^ve a prompt answer with some one duly author- ised, to make the necessary transfer; which will greatly oblige your brother and Co laborer in the Gospel of Christ  David A. Stevens  adress Colonia Juarez Canton Galeana Chihuahua Mexico ENDENTRY DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR UNITED STATES GEOLOGICAL SURVEY  WASHINGTON, D. C. March 4, 1892.  To the President of the Church of the Latter-Day Saints Salt Lake City, Utah.  Dear sir:  A letter has come to this office from Prof. A. Krassnoff of the University of Kharkof, Russia, containing the following inquiry:  "Can you not tell me whether there may be got anywhere in Washington plans of the famous "Tabernacle" in Salt Lake City, Utah, that is to say, plans or an exact description of this wondrously fine hall. If these may be bought anywhere, please write me where and when it may be done, and if it costs no more than $50, I will at once send money there in order to get the plans. It is intended to have a similar building erected in Moscow, and I hope that you as an American will be pleased to see an American invention on Russian soil."  Mr. Krassnoff is a distingished scientist whose works on plant geography have a wide reputation. He attended the Inter- national Congress of Geologists in Washington last August, and afterward took part in the great geological excursion through the West. It was on that occasion that the Tabernacle attracted his attention. ENDENTRY most High, more so than I am able to do at present, for it makes me feel as if I was on the outside when there are donations called and my name cannot be found among the donors. Therefore Bro. Woodruff I write asking you as the Trustee in Trust for the Church, if you could help me to procure a pair of these Artificial Limbs, so that I can try to be along with the rest of my Brethren in rolling on this great work in these Latter Days. If you can do something for me it will be a Blessing both for me and my family, and we will ever pray for your welfare.

When I heard through a former friend of Miss Field that she was in your City I very naturally asked for her address which was freely given.

ENDENTRY I spent several years in and near Salt Nake City, in the in- vestigation of Lake Bonneville, the ancient predecessor of Great Salt Lake, so that I am well acquainted with the unique struct- ure which Mr. Krassnoff desires to see reproduced in the historic city, the former capital of his fatherland.  I infer from his inquiry that his purpose will be served if he obtains any statement of dimensions ^mode of construction, form of truss,^ etc.^,^ which will enable an architect to copy the building with a near approach to accuracy.  If you desire to communicate with Mr. Krassnoff direct, his address is: A. Krassnoff, University of Kharkof, Russia. You may write him in English, as he is well conversant with that language.

My bowels had become hardened and stiff through the effects of so much purging medicines which I had taken to get them to move, until they lost all power and completely refused to act. This was about two months ago and very fortunately for me I at last obtained a little relief. By subjecting myself to the most rigid diet, in connection with a little medicine to aid digestion I have been improving a little, but it is very slow work.

President Of The Morman Church.  Dear Sir:  I am assisting a relative in looking up the genealogy of the Presby or  Presbrey family. Years before I was born, during the Mormon excitement in the East, two of my New Hampshire married Mormons and went West, while the Mormans were at Mary Ann Presby married William M. Parker in New Hampshire. I think they had been married a num- ber of years before they joined the Mormon church. Mary Ann Presby was born in Chicago or Nauvoo Ill in 1845, not long, I think, after she and her husband went West with the Mormons. Mr. and Mrs. Parker had children before they joined the Mormon church. There is now lying before me a letter which William M. Parker wrote to  my father, dated at Chicago Feb. 7, 1845, and he signs his name as an Elder in the Mormon chucrch. Will you please be so kind as to have some one look up your records and inform me about the family of William M. Parker. Can you inform me about his children by my aunt, giving their names, who they married, andc. Will you please give me the names and addresses of one or two of their decendants from whom I might be most likely to get the genealogical information which I need. Please also inform me about the subsequent history of William M. Parker, date of his death andc.  My father also had a younger sister, Colista Presby, who joined the Mormon church and went West soon after her sister above named did. We know nothing of her subsequent history. Can you tell me who she may have married, and anything about her decendants, if she has any. Any information from your records, or which you may help me to obtain from decendants of the aunts I have referred to will be very thankfully received. Please let me hear from you as soon as convenient. I inclose a stamp fop for reply.  Very Truly Yours.  J. W. Presby.  REV. J. W. PRESBY, PH. D. PASTOR OF THE METHODIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH, MOOERS, N.
