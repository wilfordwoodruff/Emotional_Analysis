 things of this world, who aspire to   the honors of men, and do not   honor the priesthood, nor seek to   build up the Kingdom of God as   they should. Neither do they  learn and comprehend that the   rights of the priesthood are in-  separably connected with the   powers of heaven, and that the   powers of heaven cannot be con-  trolled nor handled only upon   the principles of righteousness.   Such should repent and turn   unto the Lord, and seek for the   Holy Spirit to guide them. Judg-  ments will begin upon my house,  and from thence will they go   forth unto the world, and the   wicked cannot escape. Blessed  are the pure in heart, for my   blessings await them in this   life, and eternal life in the world   to come.

 We trolled with lines 125 feet long at the stern of the boat, and  caught several Spanish Mackerel. I caught 2 and Bro Cannon   1. We went onto the Jew fish ground but caught none, they   weigh from 100 to 400 lbs each. The boatman took us to a place   where it is said there is a flat stone of some 200 yards wide   and about 500 yards in length, and at a depth of about  650 feet. We cannot anchor, but the captain labors to   keep over the rock. We used lines 650 feet long and   at the end is fastened about 1 dozen short lines and   hooks, and on the end of the line fastened a rock about   3 lbs weight to sink the line to the rock, the hooks  were baited with Sardines. We cast over these   lines and Asahel's got caught in the Stern of the  Steamer and lost the whole 650 feet. The one I had  went to the bottom, and it was too hard work for me  to pull up 20 or 30 lbs of fish 650 feet. I only pulled up   once with some 12 or 15 lbs weight of fish. I then gave  it to Asahel. The man with us, James Gardner, helped   him let out the line and haul it up and brought up  6 fish which would weigh about 40 lbs. The next time   he had 4 on about 25 lbs. It takes a long time to make  a haul. The fish will weigh from 6 to 15 lbs each, nearly   as red as blood, and they are dead when they get to the  top of the water. Their bladders burst; being relieved   from the pressure of water causes this. They are  said to be good to eat. The name of this fish is Grooper.  There must be thousands upon the rock, for the hooks

We   saw large trees of it 50 feet under water, with branches   growing out from the main body. We could see all   the fish swiming in the midst of this growth. We   saw more gold fish in the water than any other kind.   I wrote a letter to Owen giving him an account  of our fishing and saying that we start for home   tomorrow. The two Steamers both left the Island.

 Statement of Miss ^Mary^ Alice Woodruff made on Sunday evening, August   22nd, 1897.    About seven o'clock this evening, whilst I was lying on my bed, my  father and mother and members of the family were out on the porch, Bro.  Wm. McEwan was sitting near the bed. Bro. Louis Cannon, Edward Jenkins,  Libbie Cutler, Joseph and Blanch Daynes called in to see me, they only  stayed a few minutes, saying they were willing to help me all they  could, but as all arrangements were made for my comfort, they said they  would pray for me. As they left, I felt very sad with a feeling that I  would never see them again, so I commenced to cry bitterly. William  endeavored to comfort me with encouraging words. As he was talking I  beheld a brilliant light, which frightened me. I held on to William  and called "fatherm, father." I then saw a most glorious personage  standing near the foot of the bed, his feet were off the floor. On my  calling for father, Will went out passing by this personage, almost  touching his clothing, and father and the family came in. I motioned  them all to go out but father as I thought he might also see this per-  sonage as I did. I sat up in my bed, quite awake, he stretched out his  arms over my head and said in a distinct but under tone of voice, "The  Lord has sent me to bless you, you shall be healed from this time forth.  The Lord seals his blessings upon you." He then came to the side of the  bed and said I must go to the Temple and there I should receive something  (I have forgotten what it was I should receive) and further said the  prayers of the circles in the heavens have been heard in your behalf,  and the prayers of the circles here upon the earth, also the prayers of  the saints have been heard; that I should stay here and be blessed in my  life; that I should have joy and pleasure in my union, be blessed as a  mother, having posterity. Said you are a daughter of Israel and shall  stand as a representative (f) in your father's kingdom. The Lord will  give you health and strength and bless you so that you may love him and 
 ice bergs, from very large ones down to   small ones. The sea was covered in   this way a far as the eye could see.   We stayed three hours at the glacier. The  young people went on shore, and climbed  on top of the glacier. Most of us stayed   on board. The body of ice measured 400  feet high, and 1700 feet under water. There   were huge bodies of the glacier contin-  ually breaking off, it is said that   from 100 to 1000 tons sometimes break  off at once. It is supposed that this   has been going on for thousands of  years, and yet it appears to make no   difference to the glacier. It is from these  glaciers that the ice bergs come that  fill the ocean. We started back. I   felt that I had seen in the wonderful   glacier one of the finest sights of my   life.      July 19, 1895 ~ Friday      19th We arrived at the Takoo Glaciers   at 8:30. Here also we saw most   beautiful scenery in ice. We stopped   for several hours at Juno.
