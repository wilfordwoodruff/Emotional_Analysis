ENDENTRY  No other valleys within the Territory or State can show such verdant hills, such sparkling streams, such fertile soil. To describe its won- derful and picturesque surroundings requires time and space not at the disposal of the writer. Suffice it to say that a fairer spot, more varied scenery or finer climate exists not on the face of the earth. The Valley is an oblong basin, of which the Wasatch mountains form the rim. It is 15 miles in width, and 60 miles in length, 4200 feet above the level of the sea, can cultivate a hundred thousand acres, and supports a population of 20,000 souls. There are more than a dozen towns and villages presented to view, each having from one to three thousand inhabitants, Logan, the county seat, being the largest, with over six thousand. Cache Valley is first above all other western places; the climate is all that be desired, short, mild winters and the balance of the year such as cannot be surpassed. For fruit this valley cannot be beat for flavor, quality, quantity, size or productiveness, and the finest wheat is raised here without irrigation, yielding heavy crops. Onyx and all the precious metals are in the surrounding mountains and  for investments in real estate this Valley cannot be excelled. Cache Valley has at present but one railroad, the Union Pacific. The academy in the  northern part of the valley, built by the people of Oneida Co., is a noble institution and worthy of patronage. All lines of business are represented, such as lumber yards, planing mills, flouring mills (roller process), machine shops, mercantile of every description, the finest creamery and cheese factories in the west, the best show and plow factories, nurseries, etc., The only Woolen Factory in Idaho is located at Franklin, where is being turned out a class of yarns, blankets and linseys, etc., that is not excelled in the east or west in quality or price. To the tourist and health seeker we say come and enjoy this wonderful land, that has not a peer for beauty and healthfulness, and for those seeking investment and homes where all the blessings of life can be en- joyed without a single drawback, we say come and you will never seek further.
