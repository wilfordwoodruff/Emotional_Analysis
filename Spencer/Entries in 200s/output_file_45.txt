 Statement of Miss ^Mary^ Alice Woodruff made on Sunday evening, August 22nd, 1897.About seven o'clock this evening, whilst I was lying on my bed, myfather and mother and members of the family were out on the porch, Bro.Wm. McEwan was sitting near the bed. Bro. Louis Cannon, Edward Jenkins,Libbie Cutler, Joseph and Blanch Daynes called in to see me, they onlystayed a few minutes, saying they were willing to help me all theycould, but as all arrangements were made for my comfort, they said theywould pray for me. As they left, I felt very sad with a feeling that Iwould never see them again, so I commenced to cry bitterly. Williamendeavored to comfort me with encouraging words. As he was talking Ibeheld a brilliant light, which frightened me. I held on to Williamand called "fatherm, father." I then saw a most glorious personagestanding near the foot of the bed, his feet were off the floor. On mycalling for father, Will went out passing by this personage, almosttouching his clothing, and father and the family came in. I motionedthem all to go out but father as I thought he might also see this per-sonage as I did. I sat up in my bed, quite awake, he stretched out hisarms over my head and said in a distinct but under tone of voice, "TheLord has sent me to bless you, you shall be healed from this time forth.The Lord seals his blessings upon you." He then came to the side of thebed and said I must go to the Temple and there I should receive something(I have forgotten what it was I should receive) and further said theprayers of the circles in the heavens have been heard in your behalf,and the prayers of the circles here upon the earth, also the prayers ofthe saints have been heard; that I should stay here and be blessed in mylife; that I should have joy and pleasure in my union, be blessed as amother, having posterity. Said you are a daughter of Israel and shallstand as a representative (f) in your father's kingdom. The Lord willgive you health and strength and bless you so that you may love him and 
 ice bergs, from very large ones down to small ones. The sea was covered in this way a far as the eye could see. We stayed three hours at the glacier. Theyoung people went on shore, and climbedon top of the glacier. Most of us stayed on board. The body of ice measured 400feet high, and 1700 feet under water. There were huge bodies of the glacier contin-ually breaking off, it is said that from 100 to 1000 tons sometimes breakoff at once. It is supposed that this has been going on for thousands ofyears, and yet it appears to make no difference to the glacier. It is from theseglaciers that the ice bergs come thatfill the ocean. We started back. I felt that I had seen in the wonderful glacier one of the finest sights of my life.July 19, 1895 ~ Friday19th We arrived at the Takoo Glaciers at 8:30.
