To the Saints Scattered Abroad, Greet- ing:  DEAR BRETHREN:-I feel desirous to  express myself upon the present con- dition of Zion and its inhabitants. The history of which we are making as Latter-day Saints is strictly in fulfil- ment of the revelations of God, as  given through the mouths of Prophets and inspired men to the inhabitants  of the earth in every dispensation  when God has had an acknowledged  people on the earth. The God of  heaven, who created this earth and placed His children upon it, gave  unto them a law whereby they might  be exalted and saved in a kingdom of  glory. For there is a law given unto  all kingdoms, and all things are governed by law throughout the  whole universe. Whatever law any- one keeps he is preserved by that  law, and he receives whatever re- ward that law guarantees unto him. It is the will of God that all His chil- dren should obey the highest law, that they may receive the highest  glory that is ordained for all immor- tal beings. But God has given all  His children an agency to choose  what law they will keep.  These two principles do exist— good and evil; God and the Devil.  Whatever leads to good and to do good is of God. Whatever leads to  evil and to do evil is of the Devil. God has labored from the creation of  man to lead him to keep the celestial  law, that he may inherit a celestial  glory and partake of eternal life, the greatest of all the gifts of God to man:  while the Devil, with all the fallen angels, has labored from the creation  to lead man astray, to lead him down to the perdition of ungodly men, that  he may have dominion over him.  These two principles have governed and controlled the acts of all the chil- dren of men, and laid the foundation for all the history of the whole world for the last six thousand years, or  from the creation of man. This  power of the Devil, and of all the  fallen angels, who are represented to  have been one-third part of all the hosts of heaven, who were cast down from heaven to earth, has been at  war against God and His Christ, and  against every Prophet and Apostle and inspired man whom God has raised up, from the creation of the  world to the present day. The first  man, Adam, under the influence of  the Devil, transgressed a law by  which death came into the world. God the Eternal Father gave His only begotten Son, as a great sacrifice, to  shed His blood to redeem man from  death. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.  The God of heaven, whom we wor- ship, is represented as the Father,  the Son and the Holy Ghost. The Father and Son have tabernacles, and  they created man after their own image. But the Holy Ghost is a spirit and a witness and a testimony  of the Father and the Son. This  Holy Ghost and witness are promised unto all men who will obey the law  of the Gospel, which God has re- vealed to the human family. This  Holy Ghost rested upon Adam when  he blessed in posterity in Adam- ondi-Ahman, three years previous to  his death.  The Lord gave unto Adam and  many of his sons the Holy Priest- hood, whereby they could administer  in the ordinances of the Gospel of life and salvation. The Lord has  raised up men in every dispensation,  when He has had a people on earth unto whom He has given the Priest- hood, and all people have been  blessed when they hearkened to  the voice of the Lord. On the other hand, when the inhabitants of the  earth have become wicked, and have transgressed the law of God, they  have been chastised, and when they have become ripened in iniquity they have been cut off from the earth, as  in the case of Noah and Lot, and “as  it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of  Man.” The righteous were saved while the wicked were destroyed.  The whole history of the dealings  of the Lord with man has shown the benefits and blessings of obeying the Lord and keeping His command ments. The history of the dealings  of the Lord with ancient Israel shows that He blessed the righteous and  cursed the wicked and brought His  judgements upon them. Whenever Israel hearkened to the teachings of  Moses and the prophets, they pros- pered, and their enemies were a prey unto them. But when they depart- ed from the Lord and set up altars to  Baal, and committed sin, the Lord  forsook them, as in the case of Judah and Jerusalem, in the days of Zede- kiah the King. He forsook the Lord, and led the people astray. They  were full of blood and murder and  whoredom and all manner of abomi- nations, and the Lord warned them  through His Prophets, Isaiah, Jere- miah and Ezekiel. These Prophets  told the king and the people what judgments would come upon them,  and the Lord said by Ezekiel unto  the king and the people, “What I  have spoken shall be done.” Now  all that these Prophets said came to pass. Not one jot nor tittle fell un- fulfilled. The Jews put to death the Savior and the Apostles and rejected  the Lord and the Gospel; and all that Moses, Jesus, the Apostles and the  Prophets spoke concerning Israel,  Judah and Jerusalem, came to pass to  the very letter.  All the Prophets and Apostles who  have written since man was placed  upon the earth have seen our day,  and have prophesied of the events  which were to take place on the earth in the last dispensation and fullness  of times. They have seen the Church of God, the Zion of God, and the  Kingdom of God established on the  earth, and the gathering of the peo- ple from all nations to build them up,  and the judgments of God which  were to rest, in the last days, upon all nations who should fight against Mount Zion and the people of God. Now, I wish to ask the Latter-day  Saints if they can for a moment think that the Lord will fail in these days in fulfilling His promises any more than He has in other dispensations?  No; He will not.  In fulfillment of his sayings through the mouths of those ancient Apostles  and Prophets, the Lord has set His hand once more, for the last time, to prune His vineyard and to establish His Church and Kingdom upon the earth, to be thrown down no more forever. He has raised up His Pro- phets and Apostles and revealed unto  them the fulness of the everlasting  priesthoods of Aaron and  of Melchisedek. Joseph Smith was  raised up by the power of God, and  the administration of angels, and he  brought forth the Book of Mormon,  the record and stick of Joseph in the hands of Ephraim, as spoken of by  the Prophet Ezekiel in the 37th chap- ter. This Prophet of God, Joseph Smith, had power to organize the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day  Saints, according to the ancient or- der of the Church of Christ, with  Apostles and Prophets, Evangelists,  Bishops, Pastors and Teachers. And  the Church has been led continually  by living oracles and the revelations  of God from Heaven until the present day. It has now stood fifty-six years  since its organization, and its history is before the heavens and the earth. The Prophets and Apostles and many  Elders have gone forth and preached the Gospel of Jesus Christ to many  nations, and tens of thousands of the  inhabitants of the earth have em- braced the Gospel, been baptized for the remission of their sins, have re-  ceived the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands, and have been gathered home to Zion from many nations, in fulfillment of the ancient Prophets,  who spoke as they were moved upon  by the Holy Ghost. Earth and hell  have been combined to stop the little  stone from rolling, and from becom- ing a mountain and filling the whole earth, as Daniel said it should in the last days. Joseph Smith, his brother  Hyrum, with several of the Apostles  and Elders and many Saints, have  already sealed their testimony with thir blood, and to-day prisons are crowded with the Elders of Israel for keeping the commandments of God, and many others have been driven  into exile for the same cause.  Many of the inhabitants of the land are stirred up and are desirous to de- stroy the Church and Kingdom of  God from off the earth. But they  know not the thoughts of the Lord, neither understand they His ways.  The Gentile or Christian world to-day can no more commit sins, and be  guilty of lying, stealing, blasphemy, whoredoms, or murder, or commit  any abominations, and escape the  wrath of God, than could Sodom and  Gomorrah, or the antediluvian world,  or ancient Israel. The word of the  Lord has been proclaimed against the Gentiles and all the inhabitants of  the earth in the last days who com- mit sin, and it will as assuredly be fulfilled as in ancient days. The Lord has a controversy with this genera- tion, and He will judge the inhabi- tants according to the deeds done in  the body, and none can stay His  hand.  I want to say to the Saints of God who dwell in the flesh to-day, that  the 56 years which have passed away since the organization of the Church  of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, have taken into the spirit world all  our Prophets, Apostles, Elders and Saints, who have finished their testi- mony in the flesh. Their voice is hushed in death and their testimony  is closed. They are mingling with  the spirits of the righteous and wait- ing for the great day of the coming of the Son of Man, when Jesus Christ will come in the clouds of heaven to  reward every man according to the  deeds done in the body. But though they have passed away, is the work  of God finished on the earth? Verily no. Has the warning voice ceased to be heard by the inhabitants of the  earth? It has not. All of us who remain in the flesh are under as much obligation to lift the warning voice  and reap while the day lasts as  were those who have passed away.  The Lord said to Ezekiel, “I have  made thee a watchman unto the  House of Israel.” “When I say unto  the wicked, Thou shalt surely die;  and thou givest him not warning, nor  speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine  hand. Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall  die in his iniquity; but thou hast de- livered thy soul.” This is precisely our condition to-day. As Apostles,  Seventies, High Priests, and Elders,  we and all men who bear any portion of the Holy Priesthood, are watch- men upon the walls of Zion and mes- sengers to all the inhabitants of the  earth, and all of us will be held re- sponsible if we donot improve ourtime  and lift the warning voice, as far as we have opportunity, and warn this  generation of the judgments of God  which await them.  I know the judgments of God are  very nigh unto the door of this na- tion and this generation, and they  will overtake the world before it is prepared for that time. Even the  coming of the Son of Man is nigh, and he will come as a thief in the night. Who is prepared to abide  the day of His coming? It is our  duty to labor and reap. Then every man should be diligent in that sphere in which he is called to act, that his  garments may be clean from the  blood of all men.  I do not believe there was ever a  generation of men who inhabited the  earth who were more wicked, or who  were practising greater abominations,  or who were sinning against greater  light and knowledge, or who had a  greater flood of judgments proclaimed  against them by the word of the Lord, than the generation in which we live. Therefore, as Saints of the living God,  who bear the Holy Priesthood, we shall be under condemnation if we do  not lift up the warning voice against the evils and abominations which ex- ist, so far as we have opportunity.  How many woes the Prophets  and Apostles have proclaimed against  those who fight against Zion. “Woe  unto all those who discomfort my  people, and drive and murder them, and testify against them, saith the Lord of hosts. A generation of vipers shall not escape the damnation of  hell. Behold, mine eyes see and  know all their works, and I have in reserve a swift judgment, in the sea- son thereof, for them all. For there  is a time appointed for every man, according at his work shall be.”  I will say to the Apostles, our re- sponsibility is very great. The  Prophets who organized the Church and laid the foundation of this last dispensation, with a whole quorum of Apostles, have finished their testi- mony had gone into the spirit world. We have been called to take their  places. What manner of men ought  we to be? The whole earth is ripen- ing in iniquity, and the Zion of God should be prepared for the coming of the bridegroom. We should humble ourselves before the Lord and be in a position to be filled with the spirit of our calling, with the Holy Ghost, and with the revelations of Jesus Christ,  that we may know the mind and will  of God concerning us, and be pre- pared to magnify our calling and  bring to pass righteousness, and be valiant in the testimony of Jesus Christ to the end of our pilgrimage, here in the flesh. The Prophets,  Apostles, and all the heavenly hosts are watching over us. There never  was a time when the work of God re- quired a more faithful testimony and labor from the Apostles and Elders than to-day.  I would say to the Saints, who stand connected with the quorum of the Twelves Apostles, as messengers  to the nations of the earth, it has  fal,en to your lot to go forth and  assist to prune the vineyard once  more, and for the last time, before the coming of the Son of Man. The Lord said, fifty seven years ago, that  the field was white for the harvest,  and He had set His hand to prune  the vineyard once more, and for the last time. The Elders were com- manded at that day to thrust in their sickle and reap while it was called to-day, for soon night would come,  when no man could reap. Brethren, it is much nearer night now than it  was fifty seven years ago. The Savior said at that day, that the angels were  crying day and night for the privilege to go forth and reap  down the earth. He informed them they must wait a little season until the harvest was fully ripe. The na- tions must be warned, Zion must be  established, and the wheat, or the  Saints, be gathered into the garner,  then the angels might go forth and reap the tares, gather them in bun- bles and prepare them for the burn- ing.  Since that day many thousands of  the Saints have been gathered to  Zion from the nations of the earth.  But you are called upon at this late day to still go forth and warn the  Gentiles with the proclamation of the Gospel. Therefore, brethren,  you who are called to go into the  vineyard, whether Apostles, High Priests, Seventies, or Elders, do not  be weary in well doing. Remember, you are messengers of salvation. Keep yourselves pure and spotless  before God and all men. Seek to  bring to pass righteousness, and save the souls of men. Labor faithfully that your garments may be clean  from the blood of all men, and that the nations may be left without ex- cuse in the day of God’s judgments upon the wicked, which is nigh at hand, and those judgments will be poured out without measure.  All the messengers in the vineyard  should be righteous and holy men, and call upon the Lord in mighty  prayer, in order to prevail. It is the  privilege of every Elder in Israel,  who is laboring in the vineyard, if he will live up to his privileges, to have dreams, visions, and revelations, and the Holy Ghost as a constant  companion, that he may be able tho- roughly to gather out the blood of  Israel and the meek of the earth and bring them into the fold of Christ.  It is true that the Elders who are  called to bear record of the Gospel of  Christ to the nations of the earth are  many times called to pass through  prosecutions for the Gospel’s sake,  and in some instances to lay down  their lives, as did the ancient Saints, and quite a number in our day, for  Christ’s sake. But there seems to be a special crown of glory laid up for every man who is martyred for Christ’s sake and the Gospel’s. No  matter in what age of the world he lays down his life for Christ’s, he will find it again, and eternal life in the  world to come. Therefore, brethren,  let us be diligent in our labors in this  last hour in the vineyard. The Lord said to Oliver Cowdery, if he labored  all the days of his life and saved but  one soul, how great would be his joy  in the Kingdom of Heaven with that  one soul. We have everything to en- courage us in our labors in the vine- yard of the Lord.  While this labor is going on among the nations of the earth, there is a great labor and responsibility resting upon the whole ministry who dwell in Zion. There is labor sufficient for every man who bears any portion of  the Holy Priesthood in the various capacities in which the brethren are  called to act. The High Priests, whose calling is to preside, are called upon to officiate in Zion as High  Councilors, Presidents of Stakes and Counselors, Bishops and Counselors, Superintendents of Sabbath Schools  and mutual improvement associa- tions. In every capacity in which  they are called to act, they have an immense field in which to improve their talents and magnify their call- ings. Here is where the High Priests  are mainly called to preside, officiate and labor.  There never was a time when the Holy Priesthood, in all its various  branches, offices and labors, had a greater work to perform than in our  day. The searching out of iniquity,  the purifying, sanctifying and cleans- ing of the people, the uniting of the Saints and the general perfecting of Zion resting upon the brethren and  the Holy Priesthood who dwell in  Zion.  The whole Church, both priest and people, should give diligent heed to the late Epistle of the First Presiden- cy, which has been published to the  world. The counsel they have given  upon the various items they have re- ferred to should be strictly carried  out. The breaking of the Sabbath  day and pleasure excursions upon that day should not be indulged in  by the Latter-day Saints. The Pres- idents of Stakes and their counselors, the Bishops and their counselors, whose immediate duty it is to watch over the stakes and wards, have a great responsibility and duty to per- form. Iniquity must be sought out.  Zion cannot prosper when sin and in- iquity are permitted to dwell in her  midst.  One of the most important and re- sponsible fields of labor in Zion is that committed to the care of those who preside over and teach in the  primaries, Sabbath schools, and im- provement associations, and those who are teaching private day schools among the Latter-day Saints. Who can comprehend the result of the la- bor performed by the Elders of Israel  in these branches? No man, unless filled with the revelations of Heaven and the inspiration of Almighty God.  We send out hundreds of Elders, who go to the nations of the earth to  preach the Gospel of Christ. After  spending two of three years as mis- sionaries, if they have converted a dozen souls and brought them into  the Church, they think they have done a good work, which they cer- tainly have. But here, the Elders  who are presiding over and teaching in these institutions in Zion, filled with the children of the Saints, have an army of immortal souls before  them to guide and teach, and to di- rect their minds, that they may  be qualified to step forth and take hold of the Church and kingdom of  God and build it up and bear it off  triumphantly, after their fathers and  elders are laid in the tomb. O what a mission is given to the sons of Eph- raim, the Elders of Israel, the Latter- day Saints! To warn the whole world of the judgments which are to come, preach the Gospel to all people, gath- er the saints from all nations, build  up Zion, and prepare for the coming  of the Son of Man, standing in holy  places, while judgments waste the  wicked.  There is one admonition of our Savior that all the Saints of God should observe, but which, I fear, we  do not as we should, and that is, to  pray always and faint not. I fear, as a people, we do not pray enough, in  faith. We should call upon the Lord in mighty prayer, and make all our  wants known unto Him. For if He  does not protect and deliver us and  save us, no other power will. There- fore our trust is entirely in Him.  Therefore our prayers should ascend into the ears of our heavenly Father day and night.  I want to say a few words to our brethren who are in prison, or under bonds, or driven into exile for our  religion, or for keeping the command- ments of God. You should not think  that any strange thing has happened  unto you. Persecution is a legacy  that has been handed down from father Adam to our day. It was said of old that all men who lived godly  in Christ Jesus should suffer perse- cution. If we meet with no persecu- tion in our day, we shall hardly feel  at home when we go into the spirit  world and meet with the ancient  prophets and with Christ and the Apostles, who passed through  much persecution and tribulation. Many  of them were crucified or otherwise put to death. They sealed their tes- timony with their own blood, as was  the case with Joseph and Hyrum and several of the Apostles, Elders, and Saints in our day.  As Elders of Israel, while we are passing through these afflictions, let us  not cherish revenge or hatred  in our hearts towards our persecutors. “Vengeance is mine; I will repay,  saith the Lord.” Jesus Christ, the Son of God, when nailed to the cross, and while in the agony of death, cried,  “Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.” Why did He say this to His Father in Heaven? Because the Son of God knew full  well what would be the result of His death upon the heads of His mur- derers. He knew what awaited the whole Jewish nation, when that peo- ple said, “Let His blood be on us  and on our children.” He fully com- prehended the great suffering that  awaited the Jews and their posterity  for the next eighteen hundred years. He knew that all that Moses and the Prophets, as well as what He had spoken Himself, against the Jewish nation, would come to pass; for God  had spoken it through them, and  his words never fail.  No infidel on earth can deny the  fact that Jerusalem was overthrown, the foundation of the Temple dug up  and not one stone left upon another.  The Jews fell by famine, by pestilence and by the sword, until twelve hun- dred thousand dead bodies were car- ried through the gates outside of the  walls of Jerusalem during the dis- tress of the siege under Titus, and a  remnant was taken captive and scat- tered throughout the world among  the Gentile nations, and the Jews have been a hiss and a byword, and have been trampled under the feet of the Gentiles until the present day, and the end is not yet, the yoke is not yet broken from off their necks.  All this has come to pass in fulfil- ment of the Word of God to the  Jewish nation. So I say to all my brethren who are in exile, or in prison, for the Gospel’s sake, or for keeping the commandments of God, do not harbor any vengeance of ha- tred against this nation, or against  those who have aided or abetted in your sufferings, but rather go before the Lord and pray that He will sof- ten the hearts of the rulers of the na- tion, that they will give unto the  Latter day Saints the same rights and  privileges in the worshiping of God  according to the dictates of their own consciences as are guaranteed by the  Constitution of our Government,  which was given by the inspiration of the God of heaven for a wise pur- pose in Himself.  If I am asked why I make this re- quest of my brethren, I answer,  for the same reason that Jesus said,  “Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.” For as the God  of heaven fulfilled all His words which He spoke concerning Judea and Jerusalem, so will He fulfill all  that He has spoken concerning the  Gentiles and all the nations of the earth in the last days.  I will here say, as truly as the God of  heaven lives, and has established  His throne on high, just so truly  will He bring to pass the fulfilment  of His words. He will pour out that  flood of judgments upon our nation and upon all the nations of the earth, which has been proclaimed by every  inspired man since the world began. The seals will be opened, the plagues poured out, and Great Babylon will fall. This generation has been warn- ed for the last fifty years by inspired  and righteous men, and after their testimony will come the testimony of  thundering, of lightning, of floods,  of earthquakes, and of pestilence,  and famine, and war, and the flames of devouring fire, for by fire and by sword will the Lord plead with all  flesh and the slain of the Lord will  be many. For the Lord has said,  “My sword is bathed in heaven, and it shall fall upon Idumea, or the  world: and who is able to stand?”  No power on earth can stay the  hand of God in this work. The God  of heaven will teach this nation and all other nations on earth, that He is stronger than man. He pays no re- gard to nations or numbers, in the fulfillment of his purposes, for He holds in His hand the destiny of all  men and nations, and no power be- neath the heavens can hinder His work. The God of Israel has set his  hand to gather His people from all  nations and build up His Church and establish Zion in all that beauty,  power, and glory which Isaiah and  other Prophets saw, and to build up His kingdom, which shall fill the  whole earth, and in which Jesus of  Nazareth will establish his throne  and sit thereon, and reign over the earth for one thousand years, as the Prophet David and other Prophets  have declared. And it will come  to pass in spite of earth and hell and all  the unbelief of the whole Christian  Gentile world. If our nation or the Gentiles do not believe this, let them  wait and see, and they will not have to wait long before they will see the signs manifest of the beginning of these things. So far as the Saints are  concerned, the Spirit of God will bear  record to their spirits as they read  these testimonies, of their truth.  I will close by quoting the testi- mony of Ezekiel in the 24th chapter 14th verse— "I the Lord have spoken it; it shall come to pass, and I will do it; I will not go back, neither will I  repent; according to thy ways, and according to thy doings, shall they  judge thee, saith the Lord God.”  WILFORD WOODRUFF.

I feel it my duty to adress you these few lines, as it appears, there is something in the way, which prevents me, from enjoying the preveleges, and blessings of the Gospel; and I am at a loss to learn what it is. My reason for the above is as follows. Abouth a year ago the seventies quorum of which I am a member was called to furnish four missionaires for different contries including the Netherlands.  The presidenci of my quorum consulted with me and accepted me and forwarded my name to Salt Lake as being fully competent as a missionaire for the Nether lands and as in goed standing in my quorum. I belive bishop Stratford of whose ward I am a member, and alsoo the presidt of the stake bro L. W. Shurtliff endorsed my name. All of the four names forwar- ded to Salt Lake as missionaires at that time have been accepted and are now on missions except mine; and I have wonderd ever since what could be the cause of my rejection. Dear brother as far  as I am aware of my former mission has been  approved of the Lord and blessed with fruits upon  myn labors.
