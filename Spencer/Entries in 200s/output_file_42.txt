The grass was like velvet under   the feet. The grounds are most extensive immediately   around the hotel, and the building itself is exceedingly   large and occupies a lovely position. We are told there   is a very beautiful maze in the grounds, which, however we   did not visit. It was arranged last night that we   should get up and have breakfast and be ready to start by   eight o'clock. Mr Badlam had arranged for a vehicle   to carry us all. There were four seats, and they were   sufficiently wide for three of us to fit comfortably together.  To this four spirited horses were attached. There were   thirteen of us, including the driver. The object in starting  at eight oclock was to make the drive of seventeen miles  upon the company's grounds. Probably no finer drive   could be found anywhere. The Southern Pacific Railroad   company found this extensive tract of land in the possession   of one person and with wise forethought and discrimina-  tion, they had purchased the entire tract. It borders on the   Ocean and besides furnishing extensive stretches of   beautiful forest, there are long reaches near the margin  of the ocean furnishing beautiful views of the Bay of   Monterey and the ocean outside.

We saw a Chinese   [Junk], and there were a number of Italian fishermen   in their vessels, which carry lateen sails, such as are   used in the Mediterranian. These Italians do a great   deal of fishing here. The Chinese also gather abalone   shells. The meat of this shell fish they dry in large quan-  tities. It is said to be very palatable when dried. They   use large quantities of it in this country, and, we are  told, ship large quantities, as well as shrimps, to China.   The principal timbers of this valuable tract of land is of   a variety of pine and cypress and is very rare. In  fact botanists say that there is no cypress other  than this to be found on this continent, and to see this   variety one must visit the Holy Land. The pine,   also, is peculiar to this region. Botanists praise   the Judicious course taken by the Southern Pacific   company in purchasing this tract and preserving these   varieties of trees. of course, pains are now taken to pro-  pagate them extensively, and in many places along  the coast, and especially in San Francisco, they are   largely cultivated for ornament. We stopped at several   points on the sea-shore, some of the party gathering shells,  and at many places we saw large numbers of seals.   Mr Badlam had a camera with him, and took a   large number of instantaneous views of the scenery, of   some chinese characters that we met, and also of our own  party. This was a drive long to be remembered, and was

 Sept 25 1890  Official Declaration  To whom it may concern  Press dispatches having been sent for Political purposes  from Salt Lake City which have been widely published   to the Effect that the Utah Commission in their resent   report to the secretary of the interior allege that plural   marriages are still being solemnized and that forty or   more such marriages have been contracted in Utah   sinc last June or during the past year, also that in public   discourses the Leaders of the Church have taught Encourged  and urged the continuance of the practice of Poligamy   I therefore as president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter   Day Saints do hereby in the most solemn manner declare   that these charges are fals. We are not teaching poligamy   or plural marriage nor permitting any person to   Enter into the practice and I deny that Either forty   or any other number of plural marriages have during   that Period been solemnized in our temples or in   any place in the territory. One case has been reportd  in which the parties alleged that the marriage was perf-  ormed in the Endowment House in Salt Lake City   in the Spring of 1889, but I have not been able   to learn who performed the cerimony what Ever was done   in the matter was without my knowledge in consequence of this   alleged occurance the Endowment [House] was taken down by my instruction   without Delay Inasmuch as laws have been Enacted by congress forbidding   plural marriages which laws have been pronounced constitutional   by the court of the last resort. I hereby declare my intention to submit   to those laws and to use my influence with the members of the Church   over which I preside to have them do likewise There is nothing in my   teachings to the Church or those of my Associates during the time specified   which can reasonably be construed to inculcate or Encourage poligamy and   when any Elder of the Church has used language which appeared to convey  such teaching he has been promptly reproved And I now publicly declair that   my advice to the Latter Day Saints is to refrain from contracting any   Marriage forbidden by the Law of the land Wilford Woodruff   president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints
