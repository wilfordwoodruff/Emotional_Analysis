Mr Badlam accompanied us. on the cars was Senator Stanford. I had a conver-sation with the Senator. He is very kindly disposed and cherishes a very warm regard for President Young,and our people generally, and I believe he is a true friend of ours. He got off the train at Menlo Park. The line of railway from San Francisco to Monterey runs through a most beautiful country. The San Mateo Co.Santa Clara, and San Jose and Pajaro Valleys are very lovely we reached Del Monte, as the hotel and and station is called, (120 miles), in the evening,and were driven in the omnibus to the hotel, whichwas only a short distance. To avoid being interviewed Mr Badlam had us registered in his own peculiar way and we had rooms assigned to us in a verybeautiful part of the house. The manager of the hotel is an old friend and partner of his, and this was an advantage to us. The dining room is very large, and though simply furnished, is very beautiful. We had a very good dinner. The drawing rooms of this hotel open to the public, are very beautifully furnished and very spacious. It is said to be the best appointed hotel in the world and certainly everything that money could purchase in fitting it up and providing it with every modern improvement has been done.

 April 18, 1889 ~ ThursdayThursday, April 18th 1889Enjoyed an excellent nights rest, and the morning is lovely. The beauties of this place exceed discription.Grand old trees of the live oak variety, which nature had planted, were on every hand, making the scenery very park-like. The profusion with which flowers growis indiscribably beautiful. The grass was like velvet under the feet. The grounds are most extensive immediately around the hotel, and the building itself is exceedingly large and occupies a lovely position. We are told there is a very beautiful maze in the grounds, which, however we did not visit. It was arranged last night that we should get up and have breakfast and be ready to start by eight o'clock. Mr Badlam had arranged for a vehicle to carry us all. There were four seats, and they were sufficiently wide for three of us to fit comfortably together.To this four spirited horses were attached. There were thirteen of us, including the driver. The object in startingat eight oclock was to make the drive of seventeen milesupon the company's grounds. Probably no finer drive could be found anywhere. The Southern Pacific Railroad company found this extensive tract of land in the possession of one person and with wise forethought and discrimina-tion, they had purchased the entire tract. It borders on the Ocean and besides furnishing extensive stretches of beautiful forest, there are long reaches near the marginof the ocean furnishing beautiful views of the Bay of Monterey and the ocean outside.

 Sept 25 1890Official DeclarationTo whom it may concernPress dispatches having been sent for Political purposesfrom Salt Lake City which have been widely published to the Effect that the Utah Commission in their resent report to the secretary of the interior allege that plural marriages are still being solemnized and that forty or more such marriages have been contracted in Utah sinc last June or during the past year, also that in public discourses the Leaders of the Church have taught Encourgedand urged the continuance of the practice of Poligamy I therefore as president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints do hereby in the most solemn manner declare that these charges are fals. We are not teaching poligamy or plural marriage nor permitting any person to Enter into the practice and I deny that Either forty or any other number of plural marriages have during that Period been solemnized in our temples or in any place in the territory. One case has been reportdin which the parties alleged that the marriage was perf-ormed in the Endowment House in Salt Lake City in the Spring of 1889, but I have not been able to learn who performed the cerimony what Ever was done in the matter was without my knowledge in consequence of this alleged occurance the Endowment [House] was taken down by my instruction without Delay Inasmuch as laws have been Enacted by congress forbidding plural marriages which laws have been pronounced constitutional by the court of the last resort. I hereby declare my intention to submit to those laws and to use my influence with the members of the Church over which I preside to have them do likewise There is nothing in my teachings to the Church or those of my Associates during the time specified which can reasonably be construed to inculcate or Encourage poligamy and when any Elder of the Church has used language which appeared to conveysuch teaching he has been promptly reproved And I now publicly declair that my advice to the Latter Day Saints is to refrain from contracting any Marriage forbidden by the Law of the land Wilford Woodruff president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints
