 Jaffa, Palestine,   June 23rd 1889  President Wilford Woodruff  Salt Lake City  Dearly beloved and much esteemed brother,  It has been upon my mind these last days  that I should write you a few lines and  let you know that I am alive and happy in  the discharge of my duties, although they are  widely different from what I formerly was  accustomed to, as a clergyman of the world.  But  I thank God for His mercy towards me and  especially for the light He has given me through   His chosen servants of the gospel.    When I came here to Palestine, I was soon  made aware of the fact, that I was placed face  to face with millions of human beings, to  whom the latter-day message has never sounded.   I mean the Arabian speaking nations, who are  scattered all over Syria, Arabia, Egypt and a large  part of Africa.  And my prayer to God was that  He would lead me and make an opening by  which the light of His gospel would shine through.   And it appears to me that the prayers are now  being answered, in as much as I have ^found^ several 
 friends who diligently inquire into the  principles of the gospel and some have already  applied for baptism -- One of these inquirers  I would like to make you and the brethren  at home nearer acquainted with.  He is Mr.  Mousa Tannus, a man of high cultivation  and much influence among his people.  He  knows perfectly besides his own tongue (the Arabic)  Turkish, French, English and Greek.  A few years  ago, during a persecution which the Protestants  suffered in Syria, he rendered eminent service  in inducing the Turkish government to remove  the instigators of the persecution from their of-  fices.  I am now almost a daily guest at the  house of this gentleman, and he has intro-  duced me to ma^n^y people here in Jaffa and  also to a relative of his, the English Proconsul  of Jerusalem, thus giving me a chance to bear  my humble testimony in many places where  I otherwise would have found no enterance.   Yesterday I was called to a prominent family  and asked to lay my hands on and pray for a sick   child.  I did so, and hope God will answer my  prayer, to the honor of His name.  --Now Mr.   Tannus has asked me, if it would not be con-  sidered improper for him to put himself  in connection with the brethren at home by 
 the means of correspondence.  I have told  him, I think not.  I suppose, on the contrary,   that, if he would find time to write to you  about the country here, its inhabitants and  prospects of evangelisations, it would be per-  used with interest, and that you would  also find time to send him a friendly an-  swer, encouraging him to go forward and  take the step fully out, as Saint of God.  For  a man in his position, it is no small thing  to become a "Mormon" in this country, and I   do not know, whether the Spirit can prevail  over him or not.  But he is certainly very  "nearly persuaded".  A word from home might  materially assist him.  I would also be very  glad, if some one at home would be kind enough  to present him with President G. Q. Cannon's  Life of Joseph Smith.  Because that is the  very book which he now aught to read.  I   have not got it myself, or, I would gladly  have given it to him.  I have given him  "The Voice of Warning" and "Orson Pratt's works"  I would also like to have the "Deseret News"   come to him.  If the News Company will send  him the Weekly for one year, that can be charged  to my account with the News.  His address  is: Mousa Tannus, Esq.  Jaffa, Palestine, Syria. 
 With respect to those Arabs who have asked  to be baptized, I have thought ^but^ to [be] go slowly.   I have formed a bible class and they come every  day and we read the Word of God and talk it  over.  If they prove faithful, they will be bap-  tized.  They are men of bright intellects, but no information.    Well, I suppose I must no make my epistle  too long.  I with that ^God^ may bless you abundantly.  I   also wish to be very kindly remembered to Apostles  F. D. Richards, Moses Thatcher, Henry Smith, whom I   have the honor of personally knowing.    If I may hope for a few words from you, my  present address is J. M. Sjodahl, care of Henry Vocken-  roth, Jaffa, Palestine, Syria.  Your humble Servant  J M Sjodahl 
 Jaffa June 26, 1889.    Dear Sir    Little did I think few months ago, nor  could I have even dreamed that I should  now be writing to the Honorable President  of the latter day Saints of Salt Lake City  Utah which fact I look upon as being  of a predestinated character inasmuch  as am made to feel that I am in duty  bound to be one of the Instruments in the  forwarding to a certain extent the cause  of the latter day saints in Palestine relative  to the speedy Advent of our Lord Jesus and  the necessity of true repentance which  I will endeavour by Gods' help to infuse  into the minds of the natives upon every  available opportunity: as regard myelf  I dont see as yet the necessity of baptism  though on the other hand I think it is  right that enquirers should be baptised  in due time in conformity with the  ordinances of the Church of the latter day  Saints.    Before I was acquainted with Mr  Sjodahl I knew hardly any thing about  the Mormons until I read the books which    To   Wilford Woodruff Esqr.  Salt Lake City, Utah Tar  U. S. of America 
 which he kindly sent me from Caiffa and   after having carefully read them I was   pleased to find that I became enlightened   upon various subjects of which I was totally   ignorant before, and now before going   further to another subject I must here   mention that for the last four or five   weeks I have seen much of Mr Sjodahl   and consequently I introduced him to   several respectable families whom we   visited several times in their respective   houses and on each visit I could not   help admiring the zeal and quiet   manner ^which^ he exhibited in the propagation   and elucidation of the truths of the   Holy Scriptures and I was much gratified   to find that his hearers were impressed   by his teaching and therefore I am   fully persuaded that by God's help   the latter day Saints of Utah will live to   see before long the fruit of the labours   of their good Missionearies in Palestine   fully realized provided that this all   important testimony of the Advent of   Christ will not cease from being speedily   born to the millions who in these   counties live ignorant therof in, 
 inasmuch as the teachings of the   ecclisiastics of the Greek Orthodox   Church and that of any other   denomination except the Protestant  Churches have hardly any good   impression upon the people.    Vices are not exhibited as such,  and what wee need is, men who   by the power of God can teach the   people the necessity of repentance   on the strength of the Advent of   our Lord. Being in this country,   and having had during a long life   much experience among my country-  men, if I am allowed to make any   suggestion as to the means that   should be adopted inorder to secure   success here I would as one important   requisite mentioned that the Church   should found here in Jaffa, a   Centrum for their missionary work,  a lot should be bought to sufficient   for the erection of a meeting house   or a school inorder that the   people might thereby be brought   into close contact with your people.    Without 
 Without a meeting place it is not   easy to reach the people, then if   possible a tract of land should be   procured large enough for establishing   a Colony of Saints. There are already   ^a^ few who express themselves as ready   for baptism and more would be   likely to follow when it become known   that the work of the Church was   really established here and the colo-  nization would, I have no doubt,   in course of time not only be the   means of doing much spiritual   good but also more than pay its   expenses.    There are several reasons why   I suggest that Jaffa should be   the centrum for missionary work  and why an eventual colony not   far from here.    Jaffa is the principal Port of   Jerusalem, Nablos (the capital   of Samaria) and Gaza the most   Southern City of Palestine and on the 
 the highway to Egypt. The Jews have   already several Colonies round about   here some of which cultivate yearly   vast tract of land with vines and   there is no doubt that the same will   secure for them in due time immense   profits. The number of pilgrims   which pass through here to Jerusalem  amount to many thousands yearly.    Jaffa is a great mercantile place.  From here is exported to England,   Russia, Austria, and Constantinople  millions of Oranges in boxes of a  hundred each of large size every   year. Formerly great quantities of   grain used also to be exported to   different part of Europe but of late   years owing to the great export from   America our export became insigni-  ficant    Jaffa although like some Oriental   Cities almost utterly neglected by the   Municipal Authorities is one of   the most healthy places in the   Turkish Empire, meats, chickens,  and vegetables can be procured at   any 
 any time of the year at reasonable   prices. The air outside the City   particularly in the South, is very   healthy. There is another point   which in my jugdgment would be   of great importance to a prosperous   mission work among the people   here. If you could by any means   help a few of the natives over to Utah   where they might find some work to do   and in the mean time receive   full instructions in the principles   of the Gospel, some of them might   by the help of God be of the greatest   use in spreading the light of truth   in the interior of the Country among   the Villagers working under the   direction of your own missionaries   from Utah. What an unspeakable   pleasure it would give me to see   some of these men return and   bring about a thorough conversion   of some so called Christians to   know the true God and seek   repentance as I have already 
 seen in a case of a native lady  in whom I have observed such a   great change since the Visits of   Mr Sjodahl to her house and the   testimony he has born of the truth   of the Gospel. When I speak of   helping them over, "I do so, because   I know that without help they   cannot go.    Any assistance that I can lend   in the furtherance of this cause   I shall be glad to do    Please mention me very kindly   to the Apostles who are at home   and allow me to say that a few   lines from you in reply to this,   will be very much appreciated    Believe me to be   Yours most respectfully    M.

 Prest. Woodruff endorsed Bro. Mae-  ser's remarks and commended his pray-  erfulness as a worthy example for all   teachers in the Church Schools. He   referred to the tendency of the schools of the   land towards infidelity, and exhorted   the teachers to prepare themselves by   humility and prayerfulness to combat this   tendency by making our denominational   schools successful 
 Prest. Woodruff said whatever leads to good is of  God, and if good, is to come from this direction all is good.   Satin [Satan] is on the alert and the practices spoken of are laying  the foundation for evil to future generations.  The parents  do not realize this is of importance to children.  If this lady   is gifted and can instruct mothers employ her.  Was will-  ing to add his influence to anything that would put   mothers and children on their guard. 
 Constantinople July 6th 1892    President Wilford Woodruff  Salt Lake City   Utah    My beloved Brother!    I am just in receipt of a letter from  President Young in answer to one I wrote stateing that it   prehaps would be a good idea to leave this city for a season   and go in to the interior of Asia Minor whare our   saints are, and whare, as I understand it, there is   a greater chance of dooing good. Our saints, I urged, need   visiting and encourageing and besides I would have a   better chance of mastering the language. And again   there is an old sister in Haifa who is desireious   of helping the work of the Lord and has promiced to   pay to any one, authorized to receive the same, one thous-  and franks to be used in the Turkish Mission   besides a years' tithing. But Prest Young is cautious   a bout accepting this money as the sister's children   are not members of the church and they might   raise some serious objections and, it may be,  cause us some trouble. Since my letter I sugested   it would be a good idea to visit this sister and as-  certain just how matters stand, and if it would   be unwise to accept the money we can explain   to the good sister, and on the other hand, if every   thing is all right we can receive the money.  President Young thinks the idea a good one   and I have, therefore, decided to leave Constanti-  nople in a few days. But before starting I thought   to pen you a few lines relative to the out look in   this part of the vineyard, and, at the same time,   to render an account of the funds sent here 
 to and in the furtherance of this righteous cause   would not be out of the way.    Long ere this, and, no doubt, with deep   regret, you have received Elder Herman's report of   our failure in accomplishing what at one time   seemed so certain. But as I dident arrive here   untill after Bro H's failure and as I dont know   what he reported I have nothing much to write   on this point. And as opinions are cheap it may   be wisdom for me to keep mine to myself, but   what I would like to say is this. That Elder Stauffer's   going home, as he did, just when success was   a bout to crown his labors and leaveing inexperienced   Elders, Elders unacquainted with the maners and   language of the people, was rather a mistake.  And might I offer a suggestion. I would say   send an Elder to this mission every six months,  so that in the future there will always be some   one here who can speak the language for before   we are acquainted with the language we can   accomplish nothing. I have great faith in the   Turkish people if we could only reach them and   I dont think the day is far distant when things   will be so changed that we can reach them   just as good as we can any other people  and our labors will be attended with greater   success. Even now our Elders can go and come   just as they please and can preach just whare   and when they please, and I beleave the Government   will yet grant us the rights we are so anxious   to obtain. I dont think it would be wisdom to   try to do anything more regarding the publishing   at present. It would be better to wait untill next   year when I hope to be able to speak the language 
 and we can work more intelligently.    After learning that the Government had refused   us permission to publish our tracts in this lan-  guage I decided to have some published any how   for I thought by useing discretion we could circulate   a few thousand a moung the people with whome we   came daily in contact with out running any un-  due risk and, at the same time, keep the work al-  ready begun slowly moveing a long untill such   time when we can enjoy more freedom.  Accordingly I got questions from a Vienna house   and place a trial order for two thousand tracts printed   in the Armena Turkish language. The price, 8 1/2 pounds,  I considered very expensive but it was the best   I could do. After placeing my order, I learned that   all second class mail was subject to examination   by Turkish officials and when found to contain   something the Government would not sanction   it was confiscated. Now the only ^way^ I could do was to   write and order our pamphlets sent by letter   postage at an extra cost of 5 1/2 pounds. This makes  our tracts very expensive still I think the money   thus spent has been well invested.    The enclosed statement with a few explanations   will be easly understood. Prest Young said the mission   would pay my railroad fare from Berlin 3rd  class but as the ride was 78 hours long I thought   I had better travle second class and I did so   paying the extra charges out of my own pocket  744.00 Ps being 3rd class. "Our necessary liveing expences"  enclude what we have had to pay out for food.  "Subscription to Osen Post." This a friendly German   news paper and I thought it policy to subscribe   for it and will charge the account to myself

 Uintah, Alleppo Feby, 17th 91    Pres. Wilford Woodruff and Consulars    P.O. Box B. Salt Lake City Utah.    Dear Brethern, Your in-  teresting epistle of 10th ulto. was duly recived and contents  noted with much pleasure. President Brigham Young had   preveoiously informed us that you had authorized him  to assist us by sending some elders and also with means  for the purpose of publishing tracts, etc, both of which are  are much in need of to be successful in spreading the Gospel  among these anxious, but benighted peple. In regards  to the subject of procureing Government grant which will  privilage us to preach and circulate tracts openly etc, I can  give no reliable answere as to what it will cost and how it  may be obtained, as that can only be learned at the capitol.  I have, however, lately been informed of some points which  may modify the ideas conveyed in my recent letters to  Pres. Young concuring the matter. For some time the American  Protestants exerted themselfves to stir up the people against us  and to accuse us before the government to the end that they  might banish, or otherwise get rid of us, but as they did  not succeede in getting the other Christian sects to join them  in their false accusation (which was neccessary to take effect,)  they had to drop their plan, and thus we are left at liberty  to continue our labors as before. The point I wish to make  is this, that all the different Protestant sects work on one   government grant, which is possessed by the English Epis-  copal Church. This grant privileges all Non-Catholic 
 Churches to proselyte throughout the Ottomen Empire,   previding they can make such arrangements with the  Episcopal Church, which holds the grant. This, then, is one  way for pocureing a right to poselyte in Turkey. To obtain a  grant directly from the government (from what I learn) will  require considerable means (the am't cannot be asertained un-  til the task is undertaken, as bribery is the common law.)  The priveleges of a grant are effectual throughout the empire  so far as preaching is concurned, but special grants are required  for building churches or school: hence I conclude that for   colononizing ^also^ seperate grant would be required. As for publish-  tracts, I learn that all that is necessary is to make arrange-  ments with some printer, who, if there be nothing to interfere  with Turkish politics, receives the right for printting and  distributing (tracts) may then be done without any danger  of trouble as far a the government is concurned, unless stired  up by Christians. This printing also can only be attended  to in Constantinople...    We are pleased that our suggestions in regards to   calling local brethern in to the ministry, were favorably accept-  ed. There are several good faithful brethern who are becomming  well informed in the principles of the Gospel. To have one of them  accompany each of the Utah elders will certainly prove a  great help. There is indeed a great field of labor before   us in this land and therefore room for a good number of elders  The people in many places are anxiously awaiting the arrival  of some "Mormon" elders, to teach them in the ways of life. 
 Since my arrival in this place our numbers have been steadi-  ly increasing. Have added eleven members to the Church by  baptism and there are prospects for many more. We are quite  regularly organized. Hold two meetings on each Sabath at  my room, and two during the week which are quite well at-  tended. On Thursday Feby. 5th, we held our first Fast meeting  Most of the Saints were presant and brought their offerings.  They pay a tithe of all their earnings weekly or monthly as the  case may be. There is a good feeling generally among us and  thus we hope to be able to teach by example as well as by pre-  cept. ...Though none of the saints here are wealthy, they are  all industrious and as yet only one has been in need of a little  assistence. It is strange to say that all of our members in this  branch are males and most of them heads of families. We have  no poper place to receive dladies at our meetings, owing to the  necessity of two seperate departments for males and females to  conform to the customs of the Orient. We are often envited  out to teach at evenings which is the only opertunity offorded  for ladies to hear our teaching (probably lady missionaries  could do much good.)    The saints in other branches of this mission were all feeling well  when I heard from them last. For a while the "Cholera" was the   cause of much sorrow in these parts; but now good health pevales  generally. The saints join me in sending greeting to you and  the Church in general. Craveing Your assistence and  prayers for in behalf of the Work of God in Turkey,    I sign myself, Your Brother.  Fredk. Stauffer

 #833 7th St  Louisville Feby. 28 [18]92    President, Woodruff & Counselors,    Dear Breothern,  I have just received a long letter   from our friend and brother Binyad from  Constantinople, the substance of which  is that he has succeeded in getting   rights for our church, that is the   Sublime Porte has ruled that our   appeal for liberty to worship and   preaching the Gospel is in accordance   with there laws and that the efforts   of the Christian sects in opposing   us were unconstitutional. He says   that the cost of court and making  out the Charter are about $2575 00/100 i. e.   6500 piasters, which must be paid, then   they can have as much printing done   as they please, and have a representative   at the Porte who will be paid from   the Government. The right for building   any house of worship would have 
 to be procured separatly. This charter   will alow the cChurch to proselyte   and distribute printed matter any-  where in the empire. I suppose that   Bro Schoenfeld has written you of   the matter. Bro. Binyad has worked   very faithfully for nearly a year without   any pay, nor does he require anything   for his labor. He requested me to try to   get some one to make him a lone of   about four or five hundred dollars   which he will return with interest   in a few months after receipt. He has   had a law suit with his uncles   for about ($25000-00/100) twenty five thousand   dollars, which was decided in his favor   by the Supreme courte after fighting   it for seven or eight years. Now it   requires about four or five hundred   dollars to get a settlement. He is a   charatiable fellow and I firmly believe   that he will do much to help the 
 cChurch financially if he can but   be assisted a little. Many of his   aquaintences there would loan him   money but for his religeous vi^e^ws.  If you can do any thing for him   I believe it would be safe and   and also a great help to him.    I know of nothing further to write   you con curning the matter, but as   I have had something to do with work   there and still have the interest of the   Orientals at herart, I felt it my duty   to make the above statements.    Am getting along nicely with my   study of medecine,    I Am as ever   Your Bro. in the cause of Truth  Fred. Stauffer

 Jos. F. Schoenfeld  Albert Herman.  Constantinople:  January 27th 1892    To the First Presidency:  Salt Lake City.    Dear brothern,    Yesterday we had a   thorough investigation by the aid of   an Interpreter how Bro. Binyad, is   proceeding with our case. In obtaining   a charter, and the right to print  in the Turkish language our Church   works, so we have learned the   following. That he must have im-  mediately Three Pounds: which we gave   him, to pay for the translation of the   Book of Mormon, and the Doc. & Cov.  Which he says had to done in   order that the Turks could under-  stand what our religion consisted of. 
 And last Saturday he says that   they gave the decision in our favor   to teach our religion, and print our   Church works in the Ottomane Empire.  But now to obtain the papers and   to go through all the ceremonies of   recording them will require Sixty   five (65) Pounds more. Makeing a   totale sum of Sixty eight (68) Pounds.  Which he says will finish the work.  But now the question arises what   we shall do? The three hundred   dollors which you have sent for the   Mission is equivolent to Sixty six-42/100  66-42/100 Turkish Pounds makeing   nearly tow (2) Pounds short of the   sixty eight. (68) which we need to   obtain the Charter. Say nothing   about the ten pounds for Bro  Binyads services. And the amount 
 what will be required to have the   printing done, and what it will take   for bakh-sheesh, which is demanded   by the Turks. So takeing every thing   into consideration, to gather with   unforseen changes, which might take   place in the Turkish Administration,   for you never can tell what a thing   is going to cost here, when its started   untill it is finished, And then to   have a little on hand to sustain   some local Elders, as Bro. Stauffers  letter says, whom we might call into   the Ministrey after we have obtained   the rights, will require nothing short   of 20000 or 25000 Dollars more,  so we have left the matter at   present, with the understanding   that we would write to you for   further information concerning 
 this case. Bro. Binyad, has also  written to Bro. Stauffer stateing   how the affair stands at present.  And we will wait anxiously   for an answere from you, at your   earliest convenience. Dear brothern,  I am sorry that I must inform you   that on account of my continueal  ill health, Prest. Young did not   think it wise for me to remain here.  So he has transferred me to Switzer-  land. So you may address your   letter of instructions to Bro. A  Herman. This is about all we have   to say at present. Hopeing it will   meet your approveal, please accept   our kindest regards, And we   remain as ever Your brothern in the faith,    Joseph F. Schoenfeld.  Albert Herman. 
 W. H. Smart  20 May 1890.  (Recd. 23 May).    Logan, May, 20 [18]90.    Pres. Wilford Woodruff:    Dear Brother:    Please find en-  closed a letter from an  Armenian Bro. George  A. Vezirian of Aintab,  Turkey. I thought it  might be interesting to  you to read a communica-  tion from that land.    This Bro. is one of the  few whom I met there  who seemed honest in  spirital matters. He la-  bored zealously, during  our stay in Aintab, as  an interpreter of the prin- 
 ciples of the gospel which  we explained to him.  His written sentiments,  I am pleased, reflect  still sincerily, and a de-  sire to be useful in  bringing about salvation  to souls.    He touches upon  points out of my juris-  diction to answer, and  as he is alone in a  far off land, I thought  it advisable to send  you his letter so that,  should you deem it  necessary, you could or-  der a letter written him.    Your humble servant  in the gospel of Christ:    W. H. Smart.

 521 1/2 6th Street   San Francisco Nov 21, 1893    Prest. W. Woodruff & Councilors,    Dear Brethren: Lasst Thurs-  day the 16th inst. I baptized Seven, Two new,   one rebaptism & 4 children. Please answer the   following question.    Josiah Watson, joined our Church, Was   ordained an Elder. His health was very   poor, the Dr told him to go to California   he did so. After he got here he joined   the Josephites. After joining them he be-  gan to Study the Doctrin & Covenants, became   dissatisfied with them. He hunted me up   I talked to him. He was convinced that he   was wrong, and decided to come back. He was   not cut off the Church. Question is his   a new baptism, or a renewal of covenants?   If the latter does he Still hold the Priesthood?  My descission was a new baptism and   of course if he lost his membership he   lost his Priesthood.    We hold meetings 11 a m & 7 p m on   Sundays & at 7 p. m. Thursdays. We have   Sunday School at 10 a. m. Sundays   Our meetings are fairly well attended, a   number of strangers are reading our 
 books, we do more by fireside chat than   any other way. Our prospects are Growing   brighter a good Spirit is with the Saints  and it is on the increase. But we felt   a little Slighted when Prest. Cannon, was   here, and also thought he gave us a "black   eye" oin his opening remarks at conference   on the 6th ult.    I have good reports from the Elders   in the Southern part of the State also   from Sacramento. I enclose a letter from   the latter So you can See.    There are a good many people out   here members of the Church, (Charlie   Savage calls them "Old fossels") The   most of them have become dried up but   with constant labor & prayer, new life  is moving among them, many of them   are poor, and some have had to be helped   from the fast day donations, Others their   husbands are not in the Church and are   very bitter. And the Sisters can't do as   much as they would like to. But they   are all feeling much better. There has   been quite a little Sickness among the   Saints, but in every instance where the   Elders have been called in the blessings 
 of the Lord has followed our administra-  tion. So we feel that we are greatly blessed   by our Heavenly Father.    I need more Elders, I need some   good experienced ones, and they must be   men with sufficient means to support   themselves, I want you to send me   more Elders. There are 56 large counties   in this State, without going into Oregon,   I want to devide the State up into con-  ferences, with from Six to ten traveling   Elders, and a conference President in each   conference, So I can do very well with a   good live, energetic, experienced, Elder  with plenty of means to Preside over   each conference, for he can (if he has means   so he can travel) get around among the   Elders and Show them how it is done. I   need at least five more Elders for the   external Southern part of the State at once.    Our financial condition here is not as   good as I would like it. I have not been   able to visit to the Elders going to lack of   means. I will give you a brief account of   our circumstances. While in prosperity   in Ogden I was trying to place money so 
 that the dividends would be ample for the   Support of my family's at home and to help   me on my mission, for as soon as I had   accomplished this I intended to report my-  self ready for I love to work in the   ministry where-ever the Sevan Servants   of God Say to go. I secured stock &   it was fully paid up, in Z. C. M. I., First   National Bank, of Ogden, and the U. L. & T. Co.  Bank of Ogden So that the dividends brought   me anualy $676. It felt that this was hardly   enough, So I invested in the Mercantile bus-  iness, with brethren that I had confidence in   to do this I had to borrow money. Well owing   to the missmanagement, of others & dull times   coming on, I lost it all about $15000. And   Some debts still not paid. I feel know it was   a loss but I think that it was robery   under the cover of law, and not only did   the money go but my name also, but I   feel to say in the language of Job, The   Lord giveth & the Lord taketh away and   blessed be the name of the Lord. The   result is I have no income for myself ^& family^ here  nor my family at home.    I hope you will not think that I write   thus by way of complaint, but that you may 
 {shorthand}    521 1/2 6th Street San Francisco Cal.  Oct 6th 1893    Presidents Woodruff and Smith    Dear Brethren: Yours of  Sept 30th to hand. In reply will say, that  I was not aware that Brother Cummings  had written to Bishop Preston untill I  got your letter.    Although you failed to find any record  of a letter sent me giving me instructions  about the disposition of the tithing, I received  the letter all right, dated March 20 1893 &  Signed Geo Reynolds Sec, which reads   as follows: "Replying to your favor of the  15th inst. I am instructed to say that no  Tithing or Temple Donations Should be read  by any member of the Priesthood into whose  hands it is paid except on an order from  the trustee in Trust or the Presiding Bishop;  and a record should be kept in each  mission, in which all the tithing paid  should be recorded."    I will be as brief as I can and explain  what I have done.    On March 5 1893 I wrote Prest. Seymour  B. Young, and ask permission to use the  tithing that might be paid by the saints; 
 ^know^ the condition of things.    The Lord softened and opened the heart of   Bro. (Dr) VanDerBergh. So that we have a shelter   over our heads and a hall to hold meetings in   free of rent, which has made it possable for   us to stay and open a mission here, otherwise   we could not have done it but how long the   Drs heart will remain open I don't know   for he is a very queer man. I must not   omit to mention Bro. Seymour B. Young   who has sent me $130, So that we have   been able to nearly live, when I say   nearly I mean that we found friends   here. We are owing Some here yet.    I never felt better in the Gospel in my   life. And I am Satasfied that a good work   can be done here. As I Said I can begin   to See a little of the result of our labors  and I want to continue laboring in the   cause of Christ.    Please send me more Elders right ay   away. I learn that there are Saints enough   in Los Angeles for a branch organization   and as I have not the means to go there I want a   good Elder to send there to preside so that he can   attend to it. Kind regards to all. Your brother    J. L. Dalton 
 at the time I wrote Sister Dalton was living  at Bro. James T. Garlick's in Sacramento, I ask  Bro Young if it would be right for me  to credit Bro. Garlick on tithing, for keeping  my wife. hHe answered me yes ^to both questions.^ And he  added that I was to keep a record as you  say in your letter, should be done, all of which  I have done, Bro. Young letter bears date 15  March 1893. A few days later I received Bro Geo.  Reynolds' letter lrefered to above dated 20 March  1893. On March 31st I sent a ^ful detailed^ report of  all tithing & Temple Donation, to Bro.  Young, with a request that an appropriation  be made for the amount ($41.20/100) for the  benefit of the California Mission. All the  Temple donations I have received I sent  the money to Bishop Preston & hold his  receipt for the same. This $41 20/100 includes  $10. I credited Bro Garlick with for my  wife staying with them one month. I   credited Bro. Garlick, on april 7 1893 an other  $10. for my wife; This is all the tithing  I have received up to date. I have received  mission fund from the Saints here since  August 22nd 1892, the sum of $51 25/100 I have  also received a little money from visiting members  of the church. 
 J. S. Dalton  Nov. 21 [18]93. 
 I received a letter from Pres. S. B. Young  acknowledging the receipt of the report of  the tithing but he did not say whether an  appropriation had been made of the amount  for this mission or not. If the appropriation  has not been made, I would be pleased if  you would make it so that all may be kept  straight. That there may be no mistake I send  you the report again. This is a copy of the report  sent to Bro. Young.                 Nov 20, ^1892^ J. P. Jorgensen,   Fruitval Alameda co. Cal.

 Orderville, Kane County  Utah, Sept 25, 1880.    Elder Wilford Woodruff,    Dear Brother    Soon after   the death of my Brother Joseph W Young   the Trustee in Trust of the Church caused   to be filed in the Probate Court of Washington   County an account against the Estate   to the amount of Four Thousand three hundred  Eighty five dollars and Seventy one cents (4,385.71)    The greater part of this amount was   for Substance drawn through the St George   Tithing Office. There were other claims   presented against the Estate to the amount   of 18 00 dollars by persons who had been   in Joseph W's employment, or who had   loaned him small amounts. the Estate has   paid 20 cts on the dollar in Stock—in the   Canaan Co-op Herd—to these Parties,  and have 8 00 dollars in said Herd that   I am ready to pay to the Trustee in Trust   if it is desired. But when I remember   how dilligently Joseph W. sought to honor   his calling, and how much of his life was   given in building Zion, I am constrained   to ask my Brethren to forgive him this 
 indebtedness, and to cancel the amount   on File against him on the Records of the   Probate Court.    Dear Brother Woodruff    Will you please enquire into this matter.  I have written several times to Prest E Snow   and once to Elder L. J. Nuttall, but duties of a   more pressing nature seem to claim their   time. I am anxious to have the affairs   of the Estate settled & hope to hear from you.    Praying my Heavenly Father to Bless   You with life and victory over Your   Enemies, I remain    Respectfully Your Brother    John R Young    [sideways text]  John R. Young   on Estate of   Jos W.

Your kindness to me while with you I   can never forget. I was happy and contented   in your home. Since I have been in   the North I have had the privilege of administering   to my wife Phebe and Blessing her before her death  and Anointing her for her burial, which   was a great satisfaction to me. I have also had   the privilege of meeting with most of my   family and spending considerable time with   quite a Number of my Children and many   others my Daughter from Iowga whom I did   not look for. I have had much satisfaction   in my visit with my family which was an   unlooked for privilege so soon when at your  Home. I feel to send my Love & blessings   to you & all your family. I wish to be rem-  embered to them, & John Squire (Concerning  that grave you speak of anything Needed to be   done so as not to Loose its Identity would be   thankfully Received.

June 8, 1888    Dear Brother & Sister Cottam    I received Brother   Cottams Letter of May 3, & read it   with much interest I am very glad   if my Photograph is of any Satisfaction to   Any body at Least my friends My health   is about as usual I have gone cold in   my head which affects my Hearing some   you see we have had to bury Brother Snow  we done all we could to save him but   He had to go, when I see so many going   I feel as though my turn cannot be   a great way off but I hop to be prepared   I am still overwhelmed in business, my   family are as well as usual Emma   wishes to be remembered to you & all the families 
 I will say to Father & Mother Cottam should   providence call me again to St George I   certainly should be happy to accept of your   kind offer In calling upon you for   I never felt more at home or happier than   while thare. And I very Highly Appreciate   such Kindness and more Esspecially while in   Exile. Yes Brother Cottam I have had many   a happy Meal at Mother Cottams Table and   spent many a happy hour in her Chamber   which my record will show often my spirit    mingles with friends in the spirit world   It may be thought strange for me to remark  that it was a great relief to my spirit when   my wife Phebe went to rest, she had become   so feeble and worried so much about me,   and the times, that she could no longer enjoy  Life and almost the last word she spoke   when dying she enquired if I was safe, her   whole trouble seemed to be about me, and what-  ever troubles I may be called to pass through   I would rather pass through them alone than   for Her to any Longer share them with me. I thank the   Lord she is safe through her pilgrimage and rejoicing   with her Children, parents & friends in the spirit   world and she will ownly have time to visit awhile   with them before I shall Join her. I pray the Lord to   Bless you with health, Strength and peace that you may   Live as long as you desire Life Your Brother in the Gospel L Allen 
 We had a good time in the dedication of   the Temple I dedicated it first   but did not stay to the public   Dedication but the Saints had a glorious   time and many manifestations of the   power of God I expect Brother McAllister   will be with you again soon. I have   now in the Historian Office a Jerman Jewish   Rabbi who has Lately joined the Church translating  the Book of Mormon into the Jewish Language   and when it is translated He wants to go   on a Mission to the Jews and preach the   Book of Mormon & the Gospel to the House   of Judah He is deeply engaged in the work   Dyer the Receiver is still hunting for   Church property. He wants all the Church   has ever owned since 1862 He says the   Earth is the Lords and the fulness thereof and   He is the receiver But I dont think He   will take much of [it] with him down   to the pit. God Bless you is the prayer of yer   Brother Lewis Allen 
 Dear Brother Cottam    We did not know that Alice was   writing to you, we dont want  you to send her the likenesses  she asks for A child don't know  what she asks for when she asks  for such things she can have ours  when we have done with them I have  just got up from a weeks sickness  with the Lagrip I was quite sick but  I am at my post again Emma  sends Love & will send you one   of her likenesses. We are all as well  as usual. Now We have been having  a good deal of snow rain & mud but   it is now Drying up Give my  our love to Wm & family not forgetting  Amelia or the Cottams Your Brother    W. Woodruff 
 The following Remarks were made by  Wilford Woodruff:    I feel to endorse the remarks and counsel given by   Pres. Young, and the brethren, on this occasion. I do not   believe that it is designed by our Father in Heaven that  any thing that has been given or organised for the buil-  ding up of this Church, is ever to decrease, but to increase.    While Pres Young was speaking of the little   time we have to spend here, and of the great purposes   of God to be accomplished, the thought struck me,  how few there are, upon the face of the ^whole^ earth that   have this work to do. When we compare the Saints of   God with the world; our numbers are very few.  Out of   twelve hundred millions of people who live upon the   face of the earth we have perhaps, a hundred thousand   of this people to-day, perhaps a few more taking women   and children. A great work in this last dispensation 
 rests upon these few men and women, for the littl time   we have to spend.    A Female Relief Society was organised in   the days of Joseph Smith for a purpose. I believe the Lord   had a motive in view in inspiring Pres. Young to organise   these Societies; they should increase. The Sisters have a great   deal to do in this kingdom; and a great many things   that are committed to their charge will prove a blessing   to them, and to the community, and to the kingdom, of  when properly carried out.    Pres. Young has referred to the subject of our fash-  ions. I consider that the fashions of this people rest   with the Sisters; especially with those that belong to   the Relief Societies.  This counsel given to us concerning   our lives and our acts is for our good and we should   carry it out. There is allways something for the sisters   to do. There is scarcely a month that passes but   what something arises where a united effort of the sisters   is good for the building up of the Kingdom.    There is something coming now. You have the   priviledge of uniting with the brethren in building   the Temple of the Lord. You can help in this; and you   have manifested in the past, by your works, that you can   do something. There is a great deal to do. We want   to build a Temple in Salt Lake City; and this is a   work that the Lord requires at our hands; and the sisters   can assist in this, as in all other works in the Kingdom   of God.    I never expect to see the time while I live in   the flesh — there will no time — but what this kingdom   will increase, and arise. God has decreed it: And no   matter what position we are in persecution, in drivings,   and with the wrath and indignation of the world   upon us — it has increased and it will do so 
 When I look through this Territory, it does   appear to me that the gentiles themselves cannot come   here and look upon this Territory and people, without   feeling that God is here, whether they acknowledge   it or not. There is something besides the ingenuity   of man; and I believe the Testimony of the Elders,   the Spirit of God, bears record to our enemies, while   here, of this work, that God is with it. This testimony   come with it, more or less, wherever the Elders go  It is true the world reject it; and hence the Lord takes   His Spirit from them; but the Lord does bear record by the   Holy Ghost to them of this work. The building up of his   Kingdom has to be accomplished. Zion has to prosper and   be built up, and become a strong nation; and there will   be no end to it until Christ comes.    I feel to bless the sisters, as a Society, in this   place. They have done well here; and their labors are worthy   and the blessings of God will rest upon them. We have   to be united together in the erection of this Church   and the kingdom. We have the whole earth against us,   and if the Lord has any friends on earth, they are   here in the vallies of these mountains.    I feel that we shall be protected in our   homes and our rights, if we will do the will of God,   no matter what that will may be. This people have   never had the protection as a church, from the time   of the translation of the Book of Mormon to the   present day, as they have had since the Lord revealed   and published the Patriarchol Order of Marriage  The Lord says you shall obey this. The world says you   shall not do it. But in carrying it have we not been   blest. We have had more protection since we have   been in the valleys of the Mountains than before;   and I feel that the Lord will protect us in doing right 
 and keeping his commandments. Woe be to that man   or family or people that fight against Zion. Every weapon   shall be broken that is raised against Zion. The Lord has   sustained us over and over again against the opposition   of forty million of people. He is laboring by faith. He   has preserved us to the present time. Now this should   be an evidence to us and to the world that the Lord has a   hand in this work; and that He will protect this people    Let us unite ourselves together, and the   blessings of the Lord will be over us. We have been a   little slow, perhaps, in carrying out the counsel to further   the home products. I do not think that we, as a people,   shall be any too soon independent of the products of   babylon.  May God bless us, and may we receive   these counsels, and carry them out in our lives. Amen

Woodruff & Counselors,  Salt Lake City Utah,    Dear Brethren:    I have turend everything over   to Bro. Maeser, and in an other week   will be ready as far as the mission is   conserened to start home, but my circum-  stances are such that I cannot go home   nor live here, without a little means,   I am owing about $80, here, I have only   the one Suit of cloths you so kindly   sent me, under cloths shoes, & hat all worn out,   wife & children destitute of cloths, Will you lend   me $150, till such time that I can pay it? Our   rent is due on the 20th if we stop over that time   & pay an other months rent we might as well re-  main the month out, till about the 20th Mch.   I would prefer to do this for two reasons, 1st   the weather in Utah will be getting warmer,   2nd Sister Dalton & the children have the whoop  -ing cough. And I fear to take them in-  to the cold climate of ^Pocatello^ Idaho, that it would   go hard with them. I have no means at 
 home that I can draw from, I can put  in my time to good advantage in the  mission till the middle of March.    Besides needing cloths I need money to pay  freight on house hold goods, for unless we  Ship what we have here have Sister Dalton  will not have anything at all for her use  when she gets home for everything ^she has^ in  the furniture line is here.    The larges bill I owe is due on the   19th inst. And if it is paid: on or before  that date it will be $44. 76/100 but if it runs over  that date it will be $51. 95/100 this being the  discount I will get if paid when due, $7. 19/100    With kind regards to all and hoping  to hear from you be return mail  I am Your Brother    J. L. Dalton    P. S. Sister Dalton, will go to Pocatello Idaho  where her parents live & remain there for the,  present. I shall return to Ogden.  J. L. D.    Please hand the enclosed to bro.

 131 1/2 Gough Street  San Francisco Jan 2d 1894  Prest. Wilford Woodruff & Counselors,    Dear Brethren:  I enclose   Financiel & Statistical reports for the year   ending December 31st 1893.    Dr J. P. P. Van Den Bergh, told me a little   over a year ago that we could have a room to hold  meetings in rent free,  January 8th 1893 we held   our first meeting in his house, and continued   to hold them every sunday as well as week nights   till December 17 1893.    Last Spring we were in ^living^ Sacramento. I had   to move from there,  I had no money to pay rent, so   I ask the Dr if he would allow meus to live in  the rooms we held meeting in here in S.  F. rent free, he said yes, and he put some  furniture into the rooms. (We had no furniture)  On the 7th of last April I brought my wife   down from Sacramento, and lived there ^in the Drs house^ till  the 20th last month.  On the 4th of last month   the Dr gave me notice to leave, I ask him his   reasons, he said that he had nothing at all  against me, nor my wife, nor children, but he   did not want the meetings there any longer,  farther than this he did not wish to say any   thing only he wished to withdraw from the 
 Branch, and he wanted to have his wifes name   withdrawn also.  He gave us two weeks to move  in.  We have rented a house, at the above address   wWe have rented a nice hall at # 927 Mission Street  We are much better situated than we were be-  fore, but we have rent to pay, and all our people   are poor  we have about twenty active members  including children and of these some are sisters   ^some^ widows, some with sick husbands, and some with   their husbands out of the Church ^& are very much opposed to us^ and some of   ^the^ brethren are out of work. So it will be hard work   to keep up the rent ^ourselves^. Can you allow & send   us $20 per month, to pay rent with? Untill   we are able to take care of ourselves, which   will be when our brethren obtain employ-  ment.  The Saints do all the can for the support   of the mission, but now we have an extra ex-  pence on us, and before we had rent to pay   we had all we could do to live and unless we   can get a little, to help us with the rent I   fear we will not be able to pay it and live.    Kind regards to all, Your brother   J. L. Dalton    I understand an allowance has been   made to cover the above named rent.  J. F. S.    [sideways text]J. S.

 131 1/2 Gough Street  San Francisco Jan 23 1894    Prests Woodruff and Counselors,    Dear Brethren: Yours of the 15th  releasing me is to hand.  I cannot say   that I feel thankful for it, for  the reason that I have labored under  very adverse circumstances, and it does  not look like I have done anything.  I am just begining to see a little of  the result of my labors, and to leave it  just now it looks like I have not   accomplished any thing, I would have  much prefered to have remained here   an other year, But I have made it  a rule of my life to do, in the church-  as I have been told, so I bow in sub-  jection to what you say but not with  a thankfull heart, but with many   regrets. I will abide your council and  do as you have said.    With kind regards to all,  your brother  J.L. Dalton.    It is not usual that an elder receives his   release to come home with unthankfulness, I   think it is an indication that his release is timely.  J.F.S

In consideration of this decision and after having   conferred with Sister Margaret A. Caine, in charge   of the Utah Territorial Exhibit, I have arranged   with our Missionaries to assist me in packing   up the things belonging to our Educational Exhibits,   commencing the day following and hoping to   finish it all in one day. It will all come back   in charge of the Territorial Exhibit and be labeled   accordingly, including the things from the Brigham   Young Academy, Provo, everything to go to Salt Lake City.  Sister Caine says, there will be no special charge for our   boxes. It may take sometime, however, before the turn  for the Utah Exhibit comes, to be shipped, until that   time one of our Missionaries, if I should not be here   then anymore, would have to see to the loading of   our things into the car.    I shall have a correct invoice of all the articles  and books shipped back, and settle with the

 firm of Geo. Q. Cannon & Sons for the books sold,  at my return to Salt Lake. The large picture of the   Salt Lake Temple, framed, but glass cracked across   the middle, is a sermon in itself, and would do   a great deal of good in the San Francisco Mee-  tinghouse. Could it be left here? Tracts and   Deseret News sent here for distribution, will   be left with the San Francisco Branch, thus re-  ducing considerable weight in our freight, and   doing good here. The record of daily visitors at   our Exhibit will be submitted to you on my   return. It contains names of people from every   clime upon the earth almost, and of some   eminent men and women, all of whom   have received my testimony in some   shape or another, and the most of them   have been presented with tracts. I take the   liberty of suggesting, that a copy of "Analysis   of the Book of Mormon" should be given with   aevery copy of the Book of Mormon to be sold,   and also the "Story of the Book of Mormon"  urgently be recommended to the purchaser.  I have found here these two ^to be^ great auxiliaries   to my testimonies concerning the authenticity   of the Book of Mormon. Among the tracts placed   at the disposal at this Fair; I have found, "The   Modern Prophet" and "The Plan of Salvation"  to be the most available.

REYNOLDS, SECRETARY.    17 1/2 Oak Str. San Francisco, July 27, 1894.    President Wilford Woodruff.    Dear Brother,    Having been set apart for my mission to California,  at the Historian's Office, Friday, January 20th, last, I started,   accompanied by my daughter Ottilie, for my destination,  Monday, January 23, and arrived at San Francisco, Wed-  nesday, January 25. Elders John L. Dalton and Ezekiel L. Blod-  gett recived me us at the landing with whom I shortly after   proceeded to the Midwinter Fair Grounds to present my letter   of introduction to Mr. Badlam, Secretary of the MidExecutive   Committee. It gives me much pleasure to report to you   the uniform kindness with which Mr. Badlam has trea-  ted me in consequence of which all preliminary arrange-  ments for our educational exhibit were greatly facilita-  ted.    The Exhibit.    A place ^space, 15 x 17 ft^ on the North Gallery of the Liberal Art Buil-  ding, had been assigned us, by th and we proceeded at   once to dedicate that place in a quiet and undemon-  strative manner. One of the bretheren of the San Fran-  cisco Branch was engaged to put up the fixings under  contract, and in a few days we were ready to

REYNOLDS, SECRETARTY.    The California Mission has at present beside my-  self, Bros. Williams, Keller, and Blodgett, as Missio-  naries, of whom the latter two ought to be released  to return home. These bretheren, although faith-  ful man, are, it seems to me, entirely nonsuited  for this peculiar field of labor. There is a spirit  of selfsufficiency prevailing among the people of  California, and San Franciscan in particular, that  causes people to look with supercilious contempt  upon any man attempting to teach or preach that  does not come up to their standard of intelligence.  A man, laboring here as Missionary, needs much  wisdom and some experience, or else, he is simpl-  ly "walked over". Bro. Williams would do as a  valuable assistant to a President of the Mission  that would be able to carry on a vigorous cor-  respondence with scattered members throughout  California, engage the attention of men of edu-  cation and refinement, and exercise a kind of  magnetic influence upon the public meetings  of the Saints. If this Mission shall ever be strong  and extensive, great care will have to be 
 commence our labors in representing to the people   the spirit and status of the Education among the  Latterday Saints in Utah. To this end the leading   institutions of our Church School Organisation   had been communicated with and promises  for cooperation had been obtained from the   Brigham Young Academy, at Provo, and from  the Latterday Saint College, at Salt Lake.  Dr. James   E. Talmage also contributed from his own private   collection rare specimens of microscopic views.  All of these were to be augmented by a large con-  signment of the principal publications of our   Church by Geo. Q. Cannon & Sons.    For some unexplained reason much delay was  experienced in obtaining our boxes from the   East and our exhibit remained empty until   Saturday, Febr. 24, when a portion of them were   received, put up, and made ready for opening the   exhibit on Monday, Febr. 26. It was a very in com-  plete exhibit, as far as the educational part was   concerned, for none of the things from the   Brigham Young Academy had arrived yet.     But the specimens in Drawing and Penman-  ship from the Latterday Saint College; and   Bro. Talmage's photographic views, with the Sunday   School Charts helped me out considerably in that   line, although compared with the other educa-  tional exhibits of Santa Cruz County, St. Mary's College,  Mills College, Deaf and Dumb Institute, and the 
 taken in the selection of the suitable men for  this somewhat peculiar field of labor.    The Local Priesthood with Bro. Mortensen,  as Branch President, at their head, are beginning  to be aline to their duties, in which Bro. Mar-  tensen is leading out most energetically. The large  majority of the Saints, 43 registered, are people  that have drifted away from Zion for some  reason or another, and are being labored with  according to circumstances, to bring them to a  realisation of the requirements of the Gospel. The  "Josephites" have been exercising a most per-  nicious influence among them formerly.  There are several people investigating the   principles of Mormonism, and the attendances  of strangers at our meetings is gradually in  creasing. It will be a hard pull, financially,  for this Branch to raise their monthly rent  after the Midwinter Fair is over, as the con-  tributions from visiting Saints from Utah  and Sister Caine's Tithing will then cease, all  of which have been the main source of income  thus far. I am now anxiously awaiting your   instructions in regard to what is to be done  after July 4th with this Mission.    With kind regards,  Your brother in the Gospel,  Karl G. Maeser

REYNOLDS, SECRETARY.    189    University of California, all adjoining ours on the   same gallery, we stood as yet a poor show. The church-  works made a fine display though, and were assisted   in that by the grand picture of the First Presidency, the   large picture of the Temple, representations in frame   of the Latterday Saint College; the Utah Sugar Works,   and a large album with the portraits of our Leaders.  All these furnished me abundant material for ex-  planations and testimony. Notwithstanding the  as yet incomplete representation of ours education-  al status, visitors commenced to increase daily in  numbers and began to manifest greater interest  either pro or con as time went on. After several  weeks of vexatious delay the contributions from the  Brigham Young Academy finally arrived and lif-  ted us at once upon an equal footing, educationally  speaking, with the other exhibits on the gallery.  Foremost among the B. Y. A. specimens more the two  large cases of Carving Work, of the "Pocket Knife Class"  as Professor Townshend, who has charge of that de-  partment there, calls it. There was nothing like it in  the Midwinter Fair, as claiming to have been done 
 by beginners in that line of work, and the   comments on it were frequent and in high   terms. Specimens of Normal ^and^ physical diagrams,  penmanship, and drawings made up the balance.  Our exhibit being thus complete, as short time   of notice, limited preparations and circumstan-  ces could possibly make it, a large sign in   front of our booth with the legend "Latterday  Saints' Educational Exhibit", gave notice to   all visitors who we were. A book of visitors   was opened, into which many, about 1200, have   inscribed their names. There are names from   Japan, Australia, India, Palestine, Egypt, Italy,   Greece, Turkey, France, Germany, Scandinavia,   England, the United States, and Sandwich   Islands, names of many creeds, and of all   classes of society in it. With very few exceptions,   each one of them has heard my testimony, and   a great many more, that did not write their   names. Our exhibit was opened daily at 9 AM  and closed at 5 P. M. as all other educational   exhibits did. We did not open on Sundays,   as I had been instructed to do, as Bro. Cummings,   who should alternate with me Sundays, was called   home, and I had noone else competent to be   trusted with that work and my labors seemed to   be indispensable at our Sunday meetings and   Sunday school.

REYNOLDS, SECRETARY.    189    The fair closed officially on July 4th at midnight. As  all educational exhibits commenced packing up   the day following and nothing but confusion and   noise, dust, and turmoil was going on on the gallery,   I was obliged to follow suit and closed up also. With   the assistance of Bros. Blodgett and Williams, our two   missionaries here, Bro. Mortensen who had put up   our fixings, packed up the boxes and I had them  conveyed to the Territorial Exhibit in charge of Sister   Caine at the Mecashine Hall, from where they will   go to Utah with the rest.    The Mission.    Soon after my arrival at San Francisco I found that   the California Mission was in an unsatisfactory con-  dition which had just a few days before culmina-  ted in the disgraceful episode of Greenwell's convic-  tion for defrauding his employers. He was the Presi-  dent of the Branch and Bro. Dalton mhad manifes-  ted such lively interest in Greenwell that he laid   himself open to suspicion among the Saints.  The   papers were full with articles against this "Mormon   scandal", and the Josephites, who thus far had 
 the upperhand here, made the most of it. Our   meeting place, 927 Mission Str, was in an undigni-   fied locality, with crowds of loafing and smok-  ing Socialists holding their meeting on the ground-  floor at the same time, and crowding at the   entrance, thus forcing ladies wanting to come to   our meetings, to push their way through the best   they could. The Saints were discouraged through   having to carry ^in part^ athe family of the President, for   which the small bBranch was not prepared.    To the credit of Bro. Dalton it must be stated,  however, that he has labored hard and unceasing-  ly to work up this mission. His misfortune was   that he had a family on his hands, where he   should have been free from such anxieties, and   that he had called for more missionaries than   there was work for them, and finally that neither   he nor his missionaries, with the exception of   Bro. Cummings and to some extent, Bro. Williams,   were exactly the kind of men needed in this   peculiar field of labor. Of great assistance to   us were our visitors to the Midwinter Fair from   Zion who rendered us financial help by their   liberal contributions. But above all the visits  of Apostles Thatcher, Young, Smith and Lyman, and   of Elders ^Goddard^ Reynolds and Roberts have been of great  benefit to us.

REYNOLDS, SECRETARY.    189    Our Sundayschool has been reorganised and brought   into greater conformity with the  pl instructions   given by the S. S. Union Board and General Super-  intendency. My efforts in organizing a Relief   Society here, have thus far not been successful, but   we are conducting now a testimonymeeting every   Thursday evening, which is also attended by strangers.  The removal of our meetings to our new quatrters to   the "California Mission Chapel" 29 Eleventh Str,   has been a great step in advance, and our mee-  tings are well attended now by strangers, and in-  quiring friends. A Choir has been organised, antaught,   and conducted until last week by my daughter Ot-  tilie. Since her return home, I have had to take charge   of it myself the best way I could in singing and   playing the organ, being assisted in this work by   Bro. Hyde, of Ogden, who is attending here the Medical   College. As the rent for this little chapel is $3000 per  month, and nearly $500 more for the rent of the organ,  gas, and water, but Bro. Mortensen is paying $1000  out of it for rent of the basementrooms, there are   still $2500, to be raised monthly. $1500 have 
 been subscribed for thus far as monthly con-  tributions by members of this Branch, one half   of whom are women, either widows or married   to outsiders. This will be a serious question to be   solved, as thus far the assistance rendered ^us^ so  materially rendered us by visitors to the Mid-  winter Fair and $900 Tithing monthly from  Sister Caine, will cease. As there are several  parties investigating the Gospel and some are  ready for baptism, some hope is entertained  that are increase of contributions can be  looked for at an early day. The work has now  begun, and many that have drifted into  the Josephite Church are beginning to reflect  and discover that they are on the wrong side  of the fence. Much now depends how this awa-  kening is kept up, and that the Lord by His  Holy Spirit may bless and assist the labors of  His servants in this Mission in the future to the  salvation of many souls, is the prayer of    Your brother in the Gospel,  Karl G.

REYNOLDS, SECRETARY.    189    P. S.    After the departure of Bro. Cummings for home, the Branch  at Sacramento was left in charge of Bro. Keller whose personal  acquaintance I made several weeks later. Bro. Keller being  entirely inexperienced in writing, it was with much difficul-  ty that I could gather some information about the condition  of the Saints there the more so as it was impossible for me  under the circumstances to pay them a visit. It appears,  however, that the little life existing in that Branch went  gradually down as soon Bro. Cummings had left, and  Bro. Keller was utterly discouraged, hence my request for  his release. Two efficient elders may be able under divine  guidance to revive the work.    Bros. Williams and Maycock, laboring in San Bernar-  dino and vicinity, reported to me regularly their labors.  From their letters it became apparent however, that the  Josephites were having things their own way in Southern  California, and that these young missionaries were  simply walked over. This opinion was shared by Elders  Lyman and Roberts during their visits in San  Bernardino, Las Angeles, and San Diego. Both young  bretheren, therefore, by your instruction, were transferred 
 to San Francisco, and Bro. Maycock shortly after released  to return home, where he suddenly died of heart disease.  Bro. Williams is now laboring with me here, and is proving  himself a faithful man, engaging the confidence and  respect of the Saints. His strength shows itself chiefly  in his visits among the Saints, as he is not a fluent  speaker in public. Bro. Blodgett has gone home with  his honorable release, where his presence is urgently  needed.    By the kindness of Apostle Brigham Young I have  been regularly supplied of late with the Daily Deseret  News; while Apostle Lund has sent me regularly the  Millennial Star; all of which has been of much  comfort and assistance to me, and has been  gratefully appreciated.    Bro. Jas. H. Crockwell, the photographer, now here on  business, has kindly taken photographic views of  our Educational Exhibit at the Fair, and of the  California Mission Chapel, the negatives for which  are now in the hands of Bro. Savage for reproduc-  tion.    As the San Francisco newspapers charge invariably  for a short church notice 60 cents, we had soon to  give up advertising in that way, the more so as we  did not notice any particular attention being paid  by the public to that mode of advertisement. We have  now cards printed for distribution with the aArticles  of Faith on one side and a polite invitation with  place and times of meetings on the other.    Karl G. Maeser.    [sideways text] K.

 On the 22nd day of July 1839, Joseph the prophet having been  sick for several days, & his home & Door yard containg many   of the sick saints who had Been driven from Missouri. Joseph   arose from his bed with the power of God Resting upon him   And He took the sick by the hand & in a loud voice  commanded them in the Name of Jesus Christ to   arise & be made whole & he healed all that were   in his house & around about He then took some   of the Twelve with him & walked up the River bank  about a mile & healing all that were sick as he went   along & they were may among the Number was Elder   Sherwood who lay at the point of Death. He crossed   the River to Montrose went into the Home where Brigham  Young lay sick & healed him, who walked out of the   Home & followed him. The prophet came to where I was   standing & told me to follow him I did so we   then went into the Home of Elijah Fordham who   was at the point of Death, his friends had looked   for him to breath his Last for several hours. He   had lost his speech & nearly his breath. we walked  into the Room Brother The prophet Joseph took brother  Fordham by the Hand & looking the dying man in   the Eyes for several moments. He them said Brother Fordham,  in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth I comnd  you to arise & be made whole. The voice of the prophet   was like the voice of God it seemed as though the whole   Home shook from its very foundation And the man   leaped from his bed & was made whole instaneously   He kicked his pettiees off from his feet, dressed himself   Eat a Roll of bread & milk & followed us out of the House   & went into the House of Bates Nobles who was also   very sick the prophet Healed him & we knelt down & pryd   & gve thanks to God. The wicked became alarmed at the seeing  the power of God and followed to see what the End would  be After the propht Had healed, all the sick saints in   Montrose He with several of the Twelve & S. Rigdon went 
 to the ferry to Return to Nauvoo. A Gentile   came to him & asked him if He would not   go out into the country some two miles & heal   a pair of Twinn chldren about 3 months old both   of which were vary sick. He said I cannot go but   I will send a man, who will do just as well. He   Turned The prophet Turned to me & said you go   with this man & teach him & his Houshold the princples  of faith in Christ then lay your hands upon   the Chldren & heal them in the name of the Lord   At the same time handing me a silk Bandanna   red Hankerchief & said wipe their faces with that   Handkerchief & they shall get well ^and as long as you will keep  this Handkerchief it shall ever remain as a league between you & me^ then the prophet returned  home & I went & done as I was Comma[nded] & the   children were healed. The deeds of this day showed me more   of the power of God in healing of the sick than I ever   before saw in the Church & kingdom of God in any day  of my life.

 London Oct 18, 1840, Sunday G. A. Smith & myself met at   Father Cornors & held three meetings though the day and Evening  we red in the book of Mormon, broke bread to the   Saints. I felt the Spirit of God bore testimony to   me that there would be a great work in London  We retired to rest in good season. I felt well in   my mind and slept untill about 12 oclok at night   I awoke and meditated upon the things of God untill  about 3 oclok in the morning and while forming a Determina-  tion to warn the Inhabitants of London, & overcome   the powers of darkness which were besetting us day by   day and trying to overcome us. As I was forming   this determination in my own mind A personage appeared  unto me which I considered was the prince of Darknss  darkness or the Devil. he made war with me and attemptd  to take my life He laid hold of me like a strong   armed man. I felt like the wait of a heavy man   lying upon my body and he caught me by the thoat   with a strong grip and choaked me nearly to death   I struggled with him as one man would struggled  with another I felt as though this destroyer would ovecom  me & that I must die as I saw no way that I could  Escape his grasp, at that instant the thought came to me   why do you not pray, & call upon the Lord for help. I them   asked the Lord in the name of Jesus Christ to deliver   me from the powers of the Devil & preseve my life  instantly three personages came through the door drapd   in white with considerable light surrounding them they   came up to the bed side where I was lying in the grasp  of the Enemy & they laid their hands upon my head & in  the twinkling of an Eye I was liberated & the spirit of God   vibrated my whole body from the crown of my head to the souls  of my feet and I was instantly covered all over in a light   state of perspiration water stood upon ^me^ in drops As soon   as I could speak I spoke to GBroth G A Smith &   I foud that he had been Laboring under the same 
 difficulty the same power of the Destroyer had been   seeking his Life as well as my own, and he was   delivered in the same way. The three personages that   appeared unto me one was a tall man I shoude think   over six feet the other middle one was anothe man was   medium size & the 3rd was a short man they wee all dressed   alike Neither of them spoke a word to my hearing but   as soon as they laid hands upon my head & I was   delivered they disappeared. I felt thankful to God for   the presirvation of my life. (Brother Tullage Record this   in one of the Blank pages & Refer to the page)    Oct 7th 1840. In company with the Twelve and many  other Saints I attended a Discussion in the Evening held   at the Carpenters Hall, Garrett Road, Manchester.  One Mr  Barrett had tried hard for a length of time to get  some of the Twelve to hold a discussion with him. th[r]ough   his continued teazing president Brigham Young told him  the Twelve would not stoop to discuss any subject   with him but if he must discuss the subject of Mormonsm  He would appont some bo[d]y to meet him as Mr Barry   would not take no for an answer Brothe Alfred Corden  was apponted to meet him Brother Cordon as it were was   a Beardless boy yet he had been ordand an Elder &   possessed much of the Spirit of the Lord And they met   for this purpos at Early candle light. The Stand was   occupied on one side by many Methodist priest, & on the   othe side by the Twelve Apostles & Elders. The Home was light  by 3 chandeliers with 12 lights in each lighted with   gass there was some 1500 people present. Mr Barrett pledged him-  self to prove the Book of Mormon Fals & water Baptism   ^not^ Essential to Salvation while Brother Cordon pleged   himself to prove the Book of Mormon true & water  Baptisms essential to Salvation. As Mr Barrytt arose   & declgaired to the Assembly that He would prove the Book of   Mormon Fals & watter baptism not essential to   Salvation 4 ^glass^ chimney in each of the chanderliers burnt 
 to peaces & the glass flew among the congregation  And the man who had tended the gass in that Hall and  for twenty years said he had never know  any weirder of the kind. the chimneys were replasced   & the discussions went on I set by the side of Doctor  W Richards and at the commencement of the meeting  A very interesting old gentleman apperd in the congrega-  tion he sat at the end of a seat going the ally near  the platform. He made me think if what he s is said of  the Ancient of Days his hair was white as wool & rested  in a large white roll upon his shoulder, he was a noble  looking man he Eyed us with great interest &  penetrations, he occupied his seat to our view for  some half an hour I called the attentions of Doctor  Richards to him we both looked at him with feelings  of both Interest, some little disturbance in another part  of the Home attracted our attention & when we   returned our eyes to the seat of our interestng visitor  as we found his seat vacant, & he had disappeard  then for the first time we felt that we had been  visited by John the Revelator or one of the thee   Ancient Nephite, However the discussion went on  Mr Barrytt was confounded, & Elder Cordan gained  the victory, & quite a number of the methodist who  attended that discussion wer Baptized & joind the Latter  Day Saints. 
 Autobiography of Wilford Woodruff    The remaining months of   the year 1841 was spent by the   Twelve, after their return from   their successful mission in G  to Great Britain, in settling   their families in Nauvoo and   taking charge of the affairs of   the affairs Church. Several   noteworthy events took place at this   time among which were the   dedication of the baptismsmal font   in the Temple by the Prophet and   the Twelve and the first adminis-  trations of the ordinance of

IT was the merchants of Utah who first  brought the Mormon community  fairly into socialistic importance. And   this affirmation is true of them, both in  their results at home and in the influence  which they exercised abroad for the good  of the people and the glory of Utah.  Moreover, in the general sense of the pub-  lic weal, this affirmation is as true of the   Walker Brothers and Godbe and Law-  rence, as it is of Jennings and Hooper or  Eldredge and Clawson. The very con-  struction of society and the necessities  and aims of commerce convert the enter-  prises and life work of this class of men  into the public good. Over a quarter of  a century, for instance, the Walker Broth-  ers and Godbe and Lawrence have been   identified with the material prosperity and  destiny of this Territory. The welfare  of the country is their own good as a   class;—the glory of the commonwealth  glorifies their houses and augments their  own fortunes. Of all men, the life-work  and enterprise of the class who establish  commerce, build railroads, develop the  native mineral resources of the country,  and construct the financial power of the  State, must per force tend to the public  prosperity as well as conserving and pre-  serving society. And if this is the case  with those influential men of commerce  and great enterprises who have gone out-  side the pale of the Church, yet are still  identified with the community in all their  essential interests, how much more,  specially speaking, is it the case with those  men who have remained inside the pale  of the Church and built up her commer-  cial and financial power? The Church  owes to her apostles of commerce and fin-  ance more than many would like to con-  fess; and yet in this point of their extra-  ordinary service to the Church is at once  the significance and potency of "Zion's  Co-operative Mercantile Institution."  This will be strikingly illustrated in the  circumstantial history of "Z. C. M. I.,"  towards which we are traveling in these  preparatory commercial views.    Often has it been told what the com-  munity has done for the merchants, and  as often have those same merchants—who  built up the commercial and financial  power of the Church—been ungraciously  twitted that they have made their money  out of "this people." Let us look at  the other side now, and ask something  of what the merchants have done for the  community, and what "this people"  have made out of the merchants? And  this line of review of our commercial  history is very necessary to be under-  stood, insomuch as it will be suggestive  of what the community already owe to  the existence  of "Z. C. M. I." And,  furthermore, the remarkably successful  example of that unique Institution dur-  ing the last twelve years, under the  united incorporation of these apostles  temporal with the apostles spiritual, will  foreshadow the vast results which the  community will derive in the future in  the growth and augmentation of the pow-  er and resources of said Institution.    A cursory view has been given of the   destitute condition of the Mormon peo-  ple during the first period of the settle-  ment of these Valleys. As late as 1856,  there was famine in Utah, and the  community was barely preserved by the  leaders wisely rationing the whole and  dividing among the people their own  substance. But it was neither the econ-  omy and wisdom of the leaders, nor the  plentiful harvests that followed, that re-  deemed Utah from the depths of her  poverty, and the anomalous isolation of  a people reared in lands of civilization  and plenty.

 TULLIDGE'S  QUARTERLY MAGAZINE.    No. III.—APRIL, 1881.—Vol. I.    UTAH'S COMMERCE AND CO-OPERATION.    CHAPTER I.    THE INITIAL VIEW OF OUR COMMERCE.    THE history of Utah commerce is  very unique. In some respects,  there is not a State or Territory in  America whose commercial history will  compare with that of our Territory. Its  character has been as peculiar as its com-  monwealth, and that has given to it a  typing quite uncommon in its genius;  yet the typing in accord with the co-op-  erative policies which the age has de-  vised in solving the problem between  capital and labor. There is also much  stirring romance in its history. Its  story and incidents are almost as roman-  tic as the commerce of Arabia whose  mammoth caravans, in their journeys  across the deserts, have given subject and  narrative to the most gorgeous romances  in the whole range of literature. The  journeys of the trains of these merchants  of the West over the Rocky Mountains  and the vast arid plains between Salt  Lake City and the Eastern States, and  their arduous task and adventurous ex-  periences will fitly compare with the his-  tory of the merchants of the East in old-  en times when civilization herself was  fostered by commerce; and, moreover,  in the early days of Utah, it took as  much commercial courage, perseverance  and ability to establish the commerce of  this Territory as it did that of any na-  tion known in history. On the very  face of the record, we may discern that  the men who did this work were no or-  dinary men. They were capable of mak-  ing their mark in any land; and if Utah,  in the early days, afforded them great op-  portunities, it was their boundless ener-  gies and commercial ambitions that first  created those opportunities and made a  people comparatively affluent who had  been buried in isolation and in the  depths of poverty. Thus considered,  the biographies of our commercial men  have a peculiar charm of interest which  gives a dignity to the personal record of  their lives far above that of the ordinary  history of self-made men and successful  financiers. Indeed, the history of our  commercial men is substantially the his-  tory of Utah commerce.    But the initial exposition of Utah com-  merce is undoubtedly that derived from   her peculiar commonwealth, and the ex-  traordinary history of the Mormon peo-  ple who settled these valleys; and this  will lead us directly through various  phases of development to the commercial  culmination to be illustrated in "Zion's  Co-operative Mercantile Institution."  To type our commercial history for the  popular understanding, it may be de-  scribed as Israelitish; and so its char-  acteristic inscription of "Holiness to the   Lord" is neither fanciful nor presumptu-  ous, but fundamental and typical. It  may be confessed that the inscription has  been often burlesqued by the "Gentile;"  but the sociologist would quickly read in  it a volume concerning the genius and  commonwealth of a people expressed in  a gigantic commercial institution which,  in its vast activities, influence and special  methods, may become famous as the  greatest marvel in the history of modern  commerce.    And, just in this initial view, we must  keep in sight the men who founded the  Institution and especially those who are  the proper representatives of the com-  merce of the Mormon people. It would  be a very false-sighted view to consider  "Z. C. M. I." as a colossal commer-  cial monument of the Church apart from  those commercial founders. That insti-  tution, in fine, is the organic embodi-  ment of the life-activities of such men as  William Jennings, William H. Hooper,   Horace S. Eldredge, Hyrum B. Clawson,  William C. Staines, Godbe and Mitchell 
  Pres. Woodruff then addressed the con-  gregation; commenced by saying—good morning,  God bless you all. Some sixty years ago I first  heard the sound of the gospel of the son of God.  I invited the Elders home with me to spend the night.  I read the Book of Mormon most of the night, and  in the morning went to a stream of water and was  baptized: had been taught under Presbyterian  ministers all through childhood, but hungered   for the gospel of Christ and His apostles; and  would have walked hundreds of miles to behold  an Apostle. Contrasted his visit through the state  of Illinois during the past summer, with the dri-  vings and persecutions of the saints in the year 1834.  Exhorted the sisters to diligence and faithfulness  in their labors, though they are sometimes heavy  all the organizations are of God; the younger gene[page torn]  ation must bear off the kingdom; Let us be care-  ful and watchful of their teachings. He closed  his remarks by asking the blessing of our heavenly  Father upon all. 
  Pres. Woodruff said the church of Christ  has been set us again for the last time, it has been or-  ganized for 63 years, and yet we are only a handful  compared with the world at large. But the eye of God  upon us, and the hosts of heaven and of this world too,  are watching us. Then what manner of men, women,  and children should we be; we should be saints indeed,  and strive to live every righteous principle, in an ac-  ceptable manner before God.    The Relief Society was organised by the  Prophet Joseph Smith in an early day, for a purpose:  that of love and charity for the sick and hungry; and  they are doing a noble work in this direction. The  sisters have rights which the brethren should sustain.  They have been called by revelation to store wheat against  the time of famine, and we should sustain them in this call.    We must improve our time, for we know not the  day nor the hour when we will be called to labor beyond  the vail. The evil one is ever watching to lead away and  deceive the young and inexperienced; and we must be  prayerful and humble and on our guard at all times  and shun vice and even the appearance of evil.    We have one of the most glorious blessing that  any people can enjoy; that of working for the dead. I have  had the privilege of working for the redemption of over  four thousand of my relatives and friends in the spirit  world. I exhort you to faithfulness in this grand work,  an in every labor you are called to perform. 
 CALIFORNIA  MISSION    612 VanNess Ave. SanFrancisco Cal.  Jan. 1st 1897    President Wilford Woodruff  Salt Lake City Utah.    Dear Brother;    I arrived in SanFrancisco nov. 15th and was cordially recei-  ved by President Tanner; who started for home Nov. 24th. Untill  then I took no active part; but proceeded to make myself as well  acquanted with the situation as the circumstances would admit of,   in that length of time: I found that the Elders were    Grouped together,    in places about as follows. Seven at SanFrancisco; five at San  Diego, five at Los Angeles, four at San Jose, four at Sacramen  to, two at Latorobe, and two at River-side. They were hiring their  own Rooms, in each place; buying their own food, and in some instan-  ces cooking it. The actual time spent among the people distribut-  ing cards, and Tracts, was from three to four [illegible] hours [illegible]  each day. It did not seem to me that this was the most profitable  way to work: accordingly as soon as President Tanner bid us adeau  I got the Elders together who were laboring here and discussed wi[th]  them the situation, laying before them the necessity of traveling  in the Lords own appointed way.    With-out purse or scrip.    After this I went to San Jose and aroused the Elders there on the  same question; I then went to Sacramento and took up a labor the[r]e  with the Elders. On my return I issued a circular letter to all  the Elders, of which I here-with enclose you a copy that you may se  see by what means I have reached the preasant conditions. The re-  ssult was, that several of the Elders anounced themselves ready to  take the field. We met together, and after prayer and supplication  before the Lord, two were appointed from San Francisco, to Salinas,  Monteray County; Two from San Jose, to Hollister, SanBenito Coun-  [illegible] ty; and two from Sacramento, to Napa City, Napa County.    Opening up new fields.    This was all new ground upon which the Elders had not trod.  In the lower part of the State alike course was persued; the group-  es have been scattered by 2's, the head-quarters have been broken  up; and now, six pairs of Elders are traveling absolutely with-out  purse or scrip. All the others are moveing steadily in that direct-[ion].  The reports that have reached me from those Elders that have aris-  en to the true standard of Missionary life and labor, are of the  most incourageing nature; they are often entertained at the best  Hotels. Opera-houses, Churches, Halls, and School-houses, have  been provided repetedly. News-papers have advertised their Meet-  ings free. Friends have been raised up who administered to their  wants and on their departure bid them wellcome to return. Many  have listened to the truth that could not have been reached by the  other system.    The Elders declare they have not gone hungry, or needed a 
 CALIFORNIA MISSION    532 Castro St. San Francisco Cal.   March 1st, 1897.    President Wilford Woodruff,  Salt Lake City, Utah.    Dear Brother;    With a desire to let you know the presant condition of the  Mission I write. On the 9th of January I started on a tour South  and visited that part of the State. I found that the Elders were  all traveling in the Lords appointed way, traveling without purse  or scrip, except such as had their Wives with them, who ofcourse we  were keeping house. I visited all the Elders, and examined their  mode of presenting the Gospel, and gave them such instructions as  seemed to be necessary, that they might be able to handle the Scrip  tures into the best advantage in teaching the doctrines of the Church,  all now testify that it has helped them much and that a more effect-  ual work will be performed in the future.    At Los Angeles the Branch is in a good condition. Agood  spirit prevails. The Saints meet together in testimony meetings, &  rejoice in the Gosplel. They expect to lead six or eight down into  the waters of Baptism dureing the coming week. They have been hold-  ing outdoor meetings on the Streets when the weather would admit,  and have good sized congregations and fairly good attention. Two of  those about to be Baptized, a Lady and a Gentleman will be added to  our numbers as a direct result of Street preaching: this is quit an  incouragement to the Elders in that line of labor. A similar satate-  ment may be made of the situation in San Diego only that the Bran-  ch is not so strong. At Sacramento the Branch is about to receive  an increase of several new members by Baptism, and a goodytly numbere   of strangers are attending our meetings trhere, and the spirit of in-  vestigation seems to nbe growing.    The Elders who went out into new ground, as shown in my last  report, have met with all the incouragement that was hoped for. One  report from the southern part of the State says among other things,   "If one wants to get well fed, travel without purse or scrip, Itel   I tell you, they will nearly cram you to death". The report from  Napa County says, they get three meals a day and a good bed at nigh   night; and are generally invited to retursn. From San Benito and  Monteray Counties a similar voice is heard. I havejust returned  from Salinas in Monteray County, where we preached in a Hall and on  the streets last Sunday; a good feeling prevails towards the elders  and the prospects are good for a bright for a good work to be done  there.    At San Jose the Elders have been laboring for some time with a nu   number of investigators and they expect to Baptize 7 or 8 in the n  near furture. As soon as the weather woill admit I sahall go out there  and heplp the Eldesrs in their outdoor preaching and make things as  lively as I can posable possible.    Here in San Francicsco the work is steadily moving along; 
 bed; and they are spending their whole time among the people inst-  ead of from three to five hours out of the twenty four. All are  are rejoicing in the new move, and testify that the blessings that  they daily receive in the opporations of the Holy Spirit are rich  and rare beyond anything they have ever expeariensed before.    The Hall at San Jose has been discontinued; as I believe it  stood in the way of a better mode-that of secureing meetings in  private houses, and thereby giving us a better chance to reach the  people. It has also cut off some expense.    Many good earnest people are investigating the truths of the  gospel, and as time rolls on we hope to gather them into the fold;  and I fully expect the California Mission to become self-suporting  in the near future.    The whole State  lies before us, and all that is necessary to handle it, is a suf-  ficient number of Elders. There is room for a pair of Elders in  every county, and in each large City in the State; and if it  should be the mind and will of the Lord to send us twice or three  times the number of Elders that we now have, we can soon put this  Mission in a prosperous condition. I have not a doubt that they  can travel in every part of the State, with-out purse or scrip:  and be treated as gentlemen where ever they go. And now Dear Bro-  ther, if you will kindly indulge me, I will say, that well educat-  ed, bright, and inteligent young men, are the only ones that can  hope to sucseed in theis mission.    Out-door preaching  is now being pushed with vigor by the Elders in San Diego; and as  a consequence their hall every Sabath envening is filled to over-  flowing. This mode of preaching the Gospel has been resorted to in  some instances in this northern part of the State, and will become  general as soon as the rainy season is past and the weather becom-  es more pleasant. Our Hall here in San Francisco is well filled r  every Sunday night and sometimes standing room is in demand.    The News-papers  throughout the State are treating us with fair consideration. In  many instances publishing a synopsis of our sermons, and also oth-  er articals that we prepare for them, all of which is having a good  effect, and paving the way for us, through-out the State.    The Southern-Pacific Company  Mr J. C. Stubbs, 3 rd Vice President, and general Freight Agent of  the Company invited me to an interview, for the purpose of talking  over the dificulties that existed between the Rail Road people ^hear^, &  the Brethren at Salt Lake City, in relation to the transportation  of the Elders over the Southern Pacific to and from San Francisco.  The interview, however was interupted before it was concluded, by  his with-drawing from [illegible] the room, and we retired. I afterward  wrote him, stating our situation, the work we are doing, and  that which we expect to do; and that it was verry desirable that I  should be able to travel all over the State, to look after the Elders 
 many strangers attend our meetings and we have all the investigator^s^  at presant that we are able to attend to with our limited force of  Elders. Four have been baptized since my last report, and a number  of others have announced themselves as about ready to come into the  fold.    I deeply appreciate the courtesies extended to me by the Southern  Pacific Company which greatly facilitates my movements, and thus  enables me to visit all the Elders in every part of the State and  assist them in the prosecution of their missionary labors.    A great field lies before us. The Harvest is indeed greta^t^  and the laborers are few; and in the distribution of new missionar-  ies we devoutly hope that 40 or 50 will fall to our portion. We  can comfortably take care of that number dureing the coming spring.    I earnestly congratulate you Dear Brother on your having lived  to behold the ushering in of the 91st year of your life, and de-  voutly hope that you may be spared as long as this life shall be  sweet unto you.    Ever praying for your welfare I remain,  Your Brother in the Gospel,    E. H. Nye    [in pencil:  Very good report. Read to Prests.  Woodruff & Cannon who were much  pleased with it. J. F. S. 
 and to embrace every opportunity to place more of them in the  State; and in order that I might do this more effectually I desir-  ed a free anual Pass over all their Roads in the State, as well  as a regular Half Fare Clergyman's Permit for any of the Elders wh   at any time that I might desire to move them from place to place.  In answer to this letter I received another yesterday from Mr  Stubbs regretting the fact that the interview was interupted and  inviting me to call on him again, next tuesday. I took the liber-  ty to say to Mr Stubbs, that if I could report to the Presidency  at Salt Lake City, that the Southern Pacific Company, was treat-  ing me and our Elders in this State with courtesy and considerat-  ion, it would have the immediate effect of turning all the travel  of our Elders to and from San Francisco, over their road.    I fully expect to get my pass, and I need it very much  that I may travil through-out the State, and encourage the Elders  in the good work of spreading the Gospel. I will let you know immed-  iately, wheather I sucseed or not.    I devoutly hope that the course I have persued will  meet your approbation, and any sugestions you have to offer, or any  instructions that you may see fit to favor me hwith, I will do my  utmost to carry them out, according to the Spirit and the ltetter  there-of    I here-with submit you our financial and Tithing report for the la[st]  six weeks, trusting that it will meet your approval    And now with profound respect  I remain your Brother in the Gospel   E.

 CALIFORNIA  MISSION    532 Castro St. San Francisco, Cal.    Feb. 19th, 1897.    President Wilford Woodruff    Salt Lake City, Utah.    Dear Brother:    There is a couple living in Sacramento, Members of the Church;  who had their Endowments and were Married in the Endowment house:  they afterward came out here and the husband has a good position in  the R. R. Shops. They are good faithfull Latter-day-Saints; their  house has been a home for the Elders for years. The Sister is a most   most devout member of the Church. Her health is very poor; she desi^res^  to make a trip to Salt Lake City, and work in the Temple, and after  wards return to Sacramento. As there is no Bishop here, to give  her a recomend, is there any way by which she can secure the need^-^  ed Recomend to admit her to the Temple? The Branch at Sacramento  is not fully organized; it has but a presiding Elder over it; and  there are the traveling Elders laboring there. If there is any way  that this Sister can be admited to the Temple to work for her dead  and gain a blessing for her self, please instruct me. She is said to  to be, by the local President and the traveling Elders, worthy of all  acceptation. She lives in hopes of being healed, if she can be per-  mited to go into the Temple.    All is well in the Mission and our prospects are bright  for bringing many honest Souls into the fold.    Praying that you may live long, Your Brother, E. H. Nye

You ask for the individual names of tith   payers. I have arranged for the presidents of   Branches to receipt to Members for tithing & I   receipt to the Presidents. This saves much of the   labor incident to the other way & secures a record in   each Branch of the individual status of each   member by keeping a Record in each Branch  of all that is paid by each member, which   had not been done prior to my arrival. There   is no record in the Mission that will show   the standing of the members on the Tithing ques-  tion prior to my arrival. But each Branch   record now does this. If this is not sat-

Dear Brother:    In my last letter I asked for instructions on the following  matter. There is a coupple in Sacramento members of the Church;  who had their Endowments in the Endowment House years ago, and were  married there; they afterward came uout here and the Husband has a  good posoition in the R. R. Shops. They are good faithfull Latter-Day-  Saints. Their House has been a home for the Elders for years. The  Sister is a most devout member of the Church, and worthy of all  acceptation. Her Health is very poor. She desires to make a trip  to Salt Lake City and work in the Telmple; to be baptized for her  health and work for her dead, and afterwards return to Sacramento.  Is there any way by which she can secure the needed recom^m^end to  admit her to the Temple? The Branch at Sacramento is not fully or-  ganize d, it has but a Presiding Elder over it and the traveling  Elders laboring there. If there is any way that this Sister can be  admited to the Temple to work for her dead and gain a blessing for  herself, Please instruct me.    .Praying for the blessings of the Lord upon his servant W  Wilford, and upon all his associates, I remain very respectfully,    Your Brother in the Gospel,   E.

 isfactory, please instruct me & I will  carry out such instructions.    The authority you sent me sometime   ago to recomend a certain sister from Sac-  ramento to the Temple, was that intended   to be general, or only for her case? There are   others here who hope to visit the Temple  in the near future, worthy of all acceptation,  am I at liberty to recomend such also? in  the way you indicated?

 CALIFORNIA MISSION  532 Castro St. San Francisco Cal.  Jan. 30th, 1897.    President Wilford Woodruff  Salt Lake City, Utah.    Dear Brother:  I greatly fear that my letter of the 8th to you, has con-  veyed a wrong impression in relation to my arrangement with the  Southern Pacific Company. Such at least, Brother Reynolds letter of  the 12th seems to indicate. I was aware before I came here that  some trouble had existed between the Company and the Brethren at  Salt Lake City about the transportation of our Elders over their  Road. When I was introduced by President Shurtliff to Mr J. C.   Stubbs he refered to that difficulty and invited me to an interview  for the purpose of talking it over; and if possable bring about  a better understanding on the subject. When I went to that interviwew  I asked no favors; I promised nothing. I went with the determinat-  ion to secure the best conditions possable for all our Elders mov-  ing from place to place throughout the State or traveling to and  from Ogden. I stated that all we asked for all our Elders was the s   same priveileges freely accorded to all other ministers of all ot-  her donominations—the Clergymans half-fare-permit. But in relation  to my self, having been appointed President of this Mission it was  necessary that I should travel all over the State, and to facilitat^e^  my movements and enable me tovisitevery town and city through^ou^t the  State and thus open up new fields to preach the Gospel and by so  doing be enabled to place many more of our Elders in the Missionary  service, a free annual pass would be of great benifit to the work  in which I was engaged, and would result in greatly increased tra-  vel of our Elders over their Road. That all these Elders had to  come from Utah ^,I said^ "they can come over your raoad from Ogden, they  can go the other way, I have got a man to send home to morrow mor-  ning, I can send him the other way" Mr Stubbs and Mr Donalson wh^o^  was with him then refered to the unpleasantness that occured some  time ago, evidently with some feeling, and appearantly with deep  regret; stating that such occurances must be avoided in the fut-  ure: that they would issue the half-fare-permits to such as were e  entitled to them who applied directly through me; this they requir-  ed for their protection and to this I agreed. I had suggested that  if they treated me and my fellow laborers with consideration and  courtesy it would have the effect of removing the unpleasantnesses  of the past and would doubtless secure the good will of the Pre-  sidency at S. L. C. Mr Stubbs then said he would recomend to his c   committee that the pass be issued for six months. It was expressly  understood, that all Elders, wheather they were returning home  from this, or from any of the Iland Missions, desiring to obtain  the half-fare-permit, must apply for it through me; this was the  only condition made. I said nothing that could in any way bind the

 See over    CALIFORNIA MISSION    612 Van Ness Ave. San Francisco, Cal.  Jan. 8th, 1897    President Wilford Woodruff  SaltLake City, Utah.  Dear Brother:    I take great pleasure in reporting the fact to you, that I   have just completed arrangments with the Southern Pacific Company   by which they have issued to me a —:Free aannual Pass:—and ^will call^ to all   our Elders throughuout the State and to and from Ogden a Clergy-man^'s^  half-fare-permit; under the following conditions. That in all^ ^cases   either for Elders laboring in this mission directly under my control^,^  or Elders reteurning from any of the Ilands Missions who desire to   avail themselves of this privelege s theyshall make application to   the Company directyly through me; and for whom-so-ever I ask this   favor, they will grant it. After a long interview with Mr. J. C.  Stubbs 3rd Vice-President, on the 5th, and another with Mr. Donald-  son his assistant, to day, this is the result. They requir the   conditions above refered to as a protection to them against any of   our people who might under-take to secure th^e^se privelegeds without   being justly entitled to them. They hope, in consideration of the   favors thus extended by them to us, especially the free annuall pass   to me over all their roads in the State, that the good will of the   Presidency at Salt Lake City will be secured and tha t all the   Elders traveling to and from the Ilands as well as such as come to   this mission will patronize their Road from Ogden to San Francisco.  I hope Dear Brother, that what I have done in this matter will   meet your Iapprobationorrow for Los Angeles your approbation.    I start to morrow for Los Angeles to visit the Elders in   the Southern part of the State. I expect to be gone two or three ^weeks,^  if you have any word for me, kindly send it to this place and it   will be forwarded to me.    All the Elders but five in this mission are now traveling   with out purse or scrip and the finest reports continue to come in   from them. tThey declare they are are treated royally on allmost   every hand. Spending their whole time among the people and making   many friends. All the Elders are full of praise and thanksgiving   to the almighty for the change that has been made and are looking   for rich returns in the future as a result of the presant mode of   laboring among the people.    Four of the presant force of Elders in the mission will   have been here two years in the Spring. We shall need others to fil  their place^s^; beside this, there are 56 Counties in the State;  there is room for a pair of Elders in every County. I am fully per-  suaded sway^ua^ded that the elders can travil in every part of the Stt  State without purse or scrip and be treated as Gentlemen. I am red  ready to use any number of elders that you may  see fit to send me.  Devoutly praying for blessings upon you all, your Brother E.H.Nye 
 Presidency or any of the Brethren to travel this way, when it was   desirable to go the other, or at all, only so far as to state, that   the good will of the Presidency  and the Brethren generally could   be secured by kind treatment on the part of the company of our El-  ders in this Mission. I did not consider that I had any authority  to make any promises that could hamper or bind the Presidency, and,  made none. I deeply regret that my letter was so worded as to con-  vey the impression that I had exceeded the bounds of propriety  and I sincerely trust that this statement of the situation will be   satisfactory. I candidly confess that I was highly elated at my  sucsess in securing my pass all over the State for one year (it is   a regular annual pass) and a pleasant arrangement with the company   by which I could move the Elders all over the state with out any   friction with the company, on the half-fare-permit: in fact, all   the benifits are ours, while we are under no obligations.    The tracts refered to we obtained from President   E. S. Kimball of the Southern States Mission and have paid the cash   for them. President Tanner Gave me no information in relation to   obtaining Tracts; ha^e^nce I was wholly ignorent upon that point and v  very thankful to know that you can supply us; can you also supply us   with the Voice of Warning? we now get them from the South post paid   at 12/2 cents; we are very much in need of a good supply of them.    We now have 28 elders and three Sisters in the Miss  sion. 8 of the Brethren and the Sisters, are according to the gen-  eral rules entitled to a release in the near future, the Brethren   having been in the Mission from 19 to 22 22 months. This Mission   here-to-fore has been a heavy expense to the Elders and some of   them feel that it is a hardship to hold them here much longer; es-  pecially in view of the fact that from some source they have been   led to believe that this Mission would release them in 18 months   because of its having been so expensive.    If it is designed to push matters forward in this Missin   I can proffitably use 40 or 50 new Elders in the next three months   and still more as the time wears on. Will you kindly let me know wa  what I may look for in relation to this matter.    In San Diego there is a Negro who desires to be Baptised  he is a Minister, a whole-souled fellow; will you please instruct e   me what to do in relation to him.    Our prospects are very bright, the most encouraging repot^rts^   continue to come in from all parts where the elders are laboring.    I released Elder A. N. Murdock on the 14th to   return home on account of poor health and bodily afflictions.    And now dear Brother, praying for heavens richest blessin^g^  to rest upon you and with the most profound respect    I remain your Brother  E. H. Nye    [sideways text]  X- I think we should furnish him half the number he calls for, say 20 Elders. We are   perfectly satisfied with his explanation about Rail Road matters and   we are glad he has succeeded so well. The elders should not attempt  [end of sideways text]    to draw the line at 18 months, nor at 2 years. They   should be willing to serve two years or more if the  work of the ministry in the mission requires  it. I think he should get his tracts &c. where    [sideways text]  he can get them the cheapest.

 CALIFONIA MISSION    508 Fulton St. San Francisco, Calif.   April 9th, 1897.    President Wilford Woodruff,  Salt Lake City, Utah.    Dear Brother;    I here with enslose you a financial report of the^i^s  Mission for last month. After carefull consideration we find that  it is cheaper to rent unfurnished Rooms and provide our own Fur-  niture than to rent furnished rRooms: Hence we have bought some Fur-  niture and in so doing, we have had to borrow from some of the  Elders, who are now in need of their money. The Tithing last month  fell considerably short of what it was the two months previous, but  we feel sure that it will come up again much better as the time rooll^s^  on; especially as a goodly number of good a desirable class of   people have recently been baptized. If you will kindly help us out  to the amount of our deficiency so that we can pay the Brethren  what we owe them, it will relieve us of our embarrassment and will  I assure you be deeply appreciated.    Our Northern Conferance will convene in this City, Sunday  Morning April 11th, and our Southern Conferance in San Diego April  25th after which I will send you a full report of our condition.    Ever praying the choicest blessings of heaven upon you  I remain, Very truly your Brother,    E. H. Nye

 Haifa Palestine Sept 16th 1892    The First Presidency   Salt Lake City    My dear Brethern!    Your highly appreciated   letter of July 29th came to hand just as I was leaveing   Constantinople. You will understand from this that   I dident leave when I first expected to, but was, for   several reasons, delayed. The principle reason   of my delay was the fact the tracts I had ordered in  Vienna did not turn out as I had expected  they would. Shortly after my writing my last letter,  I was informed, through Mr Baichel, the agent   through whom I had ordered, that the tracts   had been confiscated before leaveing the Vienna   house. "The manuscript" said B "Has been saved  and sent to Leipzig whare the tracts will be re-  printed without any extra cost to you." A   day or so after bringing this intellegence, Mr. B.   called again this time to say he had been sus-  pected as being the one who sent the orders to   the Vienna house and, as a consiquence had   been summoned to appear before an investi  gating board of Turkish Officials, whare, to shield   himself and me, he denied all knowledge of   the same, whare upon, th board telegraphed to 
 have the Vienna firm arrested and made to dis-  close who sent in the order. The firm were   placed under arrest and bonds were fixed   at 12 pounds. They were given two days to answer   in. The Vienna people wired B to learn if he would  forfeit the 12 pounds or have his name revealed.  "And now" Said B "I have come to find out if your   will pay the forfeiture." As I was tired of paying   out money on those tracts I told him no I certainly   would not pay a nother cent on them. He said   "Mr Musser if you dont pay that fine I will send   in your name as being the one who gave   me the manuscript" "I will get off all right"  said he "but you will have four or five years to   stay in Turkey" I told him I had no objections   to his dooing just as he felt was right all that   I would insist upon was his furnishing   me the tracts I had paid for, and on his return-  ing to me 6 pounds I had loned him while he   was in distress and for I held his note. At   this he became very boisterous and left threatening   to telegraph my name right off to Vienna  I hardely knew what to do. I thought it was   possible he could get me in to trouble still  I felt sure he was acting dishonestly and that   it would be a sin to meet his demands 
 Jaffa April 2and 1893    First Presidency   Salt Lake City   U.S.A.    Dear Brethern:    I am in receipt of your   favor of Feb. 14th. with enclosed Imperial   Ottoman Bank draft No. 2887 for 500.00, Five   hundred, francs.  In your above refered   to letter you ask me to send you a   few copies of the tracts I have had prin-  ted.  Oon the 15th of last September I addressed   a communication to you, in which   I explained how it was I was unsuc-  cesful in obtaining the tracts I had   ordered, and paid for, at Austria. Since   then I have heard nothing of them.  Through   the kindness of a Mr Heilpern I have a   letter of introduction to a publishing   house in Jerusalem whare, I am   assured by Mr. Heilpern, I will be able   to get our tracts printed without dif-  ficulty and at the usual charges.  As soon as practicable I will go to   Jerusalem and see what I can   do.    I am pleased to hear we are   to have a nother missionary in   this part of the field, and that there   are steps being taken at home in   the way of educateing elders for this

The Christians of Jerusalem  would not permit them  under any consideration  though I gave them all   a chance. It was through   the kindness of Mr. Jos. Schore   a Jewish proselyte and   manager of the Church of 
 England press at the   "Holy City" that I was success  ful in getting the Jew   to permit them.    Bro Huish   has been here for some time   and we have decided that   he should return with   Bro Herman, who has also   been here for a week or so,   to the north and labor in   and a bout Aintab.  I   think we need a German   speaking Elder in this   part of the vineyard   just as soon as ^is^ possible  to get one Bro Herman re-  ports very good success   from in Aleppo and   Aintab.  A number have   recently embraced the truth   and the saints are enjoying 
 for more money. I wrote President Young for   instructions and decided in the mean time   to let matters run there course. Prest Young ad-  vised me to go Haifa but at this time Haifa   was quarantined on account of cholera hence   I had to remain in Constantinople four or five weeks   longer. In the meantime Bro Haag arrived from  Schwitzerland. Bro Herman had taken his depart-  ure for Aintab some time before this. I had tried   several times to see Mr Baichel but was unsuccess  ful untill one day I ran across him on the   street. He surprised me by saying he had   fixed everything "OK" in regards the tracts and   that they would be here in the course of a week   or ten days. Two weeks after this I was informed   by the steam ship company that the quarantine   at Haifa had been raised I had not yet received   the tracts and could get no trace of Baichel  so I decided I had been defrauded and rather  then waste any more time I would take Bro Haag   and go into Palestine. The morning we left   B. called on us to ask what he should do with   the tracts when th came, as he was expecting   them everyday I told him when they came he  could forward them to my address in Palestine  This he promised to do. It is now over four weeks 
 Mount Carml Hospital  near Haifa, ^Turkey^ Oct 4th 1892    The First Presidency   Salt Lake City   My dear Brethern!    Refering to the desmise   of our beloved Brother & fellow worker in the cause   of truth, Adolf Haag, I will say he died of typhus   yeasterday morning at five minutes past four.  On the 16th of September, the day after I addressed you   my last letter, Bro Haag was a gain taken ill   and, not withstanding every thing, that human   love and skill could suggest for his good, being   done, he gradualy sank lower & lower untill   the Angle of rest was sent to loosen the bands   holding him to this earth of sorrow & pain, and   bid his soul "Assend on high and be rewarded  for the labors you have so willingly, and faith-  fuly preformed." I was with him from th time   he was taken sick untill his spirit was wafted  above, and not once did I hear him complain   I did not, I could not think he was so seriously ill.  Not even when he got so weak I had to feed him and   lift him from one bed to the other, did I realize I  would soon have to part with my energetic &   noble companion. And even now, after seeing 
 mission.    I will send part of the   500.00 frs. to Elder Herman who, by the   by, is well and reports some success   in Aintab and there a bouts.    With many thanks for your   consideration,    I remain  Your Brother   Don C. W. Musser    Just so.  J. F. S.    [sideways text]  D. C. W. Musser  Apr. 2nd 1893.  [End of sidways text] 
 the blessings of the Gosp^e^le  Before Bro Gran left Haifa   he gave me an order   on a gentleman that has   charge of his property here   with which I can draw   what money I need.  On this account I have   paid Bro Herman up   to date 457.99 francs. Of course   this amount I will have   to report to Bro Gran who   is now on his way to   Utah and he will be very   apt to visit you with   this report and you   will under stand   from this, what it is.  I realize I have no au-  thority to pay the expenses   of traveling elders in  this mission. But as 
 since then and I have heard nothing of the   tracts or Mr Baichel.    I was told by all the steam ship agents that   the cheapest way I would possibly get to Haifa   was via Alexandria and Port Said. I purchased   tickets to Alexandria. Upon our arrival here we were   told we would have to wait five days before we could   get a ship for Palestine. We therefore decided to go by   way of Cairo and see the Pyramids thence direct   up the celebrated Sues Canal to Port Said. Arriving   at Port Said in we had three more days to wait dooring   which time I was very sick. On Saturday the ship   arrived at Port Said and just at the last minute  the agent at this place received a telegram say-  ing the quarantine had not yet been raised at   Haifa and cansiquently not to sell tickets for   this station. So the nearest we could get to our   destination was Jappa, two days journey with   horses. I fear my letter is getting rather long so I   will close. I will add however that our ride from   Jappa to Haifa cost us 100.00 frs. Bro Haags health   is not good I have written particulars to Prest Young  and I think Bro Haag will be removed from this to   the German mission. In which case we would   need another German speaking Elder here. I am   very pleased with the outlook here in this part of

My dear Brethern:    You, doubtless, would like   to hear something from the "Turkish Mission."  I   am sorry to have kept you waiting so long, but   the fact of the matter is, I have had nothing of   importance to communicate, and, therefore, thought   it best not to write.  Shortly after my companion's   death I had the pleasure of baptiseing two souls,  sisters, at Haifa. I then came to Jaffa whare I   baptised a nother sister, a blind lady.  These are   all germen people.  I havent, as yet, adminis-  tered baptisn to any of the native Aribs, though   I have had one or two applicants.  After Bro Haag's   dismiss I thought I had better stay in this   part of the country as our saints here have been   left a long time with out an elder.  Preveious   to this I had been studying the turkish language.  But as that is not spoken here, Arabic being the   tongue, I droped the former and took up the   latter study, which I find extremely difficult.  Unlike other languages, one must first learn  the grammer before he can read correctly.  My   desire was, and still is, to master this language  that I might become proficient to teach others it.  With this in view I employed a teacher, but   after a short time, on account of my finances,   I was forced to dispense with him.  Since   then my progress has been slow.    Since comeing here I have made a 
 his thin pleasant face fixed in death, after our long   ride to the cemetery listening to the doleful music   of the villi^a^ge bell made to toll as a mark of respect   for the man of God, who had left all behind to fallow   Jesus. After beholding the body of clay being returned to   mother earth, and seeing the flowers that were so   loveingly prepaired to strew on his grave, it is hard   for me to realize that he is gone and I am a lone.  Bro Haag, though here but a short time, had made   a host of friends as evidenced by the large concourse  of people, all anxious to share ^there^ sympathies by coming   to the funerall. Amomg whom I saw the German   Consulate & his wife, who by th by have been very kind to   us, the Mayer of Haifa who entertamed us all one  afternoon listening to our testimonies and, in   fact, nearly every one in the colony was in attendance    You will see by the heading of this letter that   I am in the hospital. This is a house built on  top of Mount Carml whare people came to get   the benifits of the fresh mountain air. By order   of the Doctor, I brought Bro Haag here but it dident  seem to be just the thing for him so last Friday the  Dr had us move him back to the colony whare he could  get to see him oftener, and where he afterwards hid  in Bro Gran's house. After the funeral the Doctor  said it would be absolutely necessary for me 
 long as the Elders stand   in need and ask for   help and I have some   way of getting money   I am a fraid I will   have to render assistence.    Hopeing that my actions   in this respect will be   approved    I remain  your Brother in truth   Don C. W. Musser    P.S.   I would add that the   enclosed tracts are not   printed by permission   of the Turkish Government   D. C. W. M.    J. F. S.    [upside-down text]  Don C. W. Musser  July 24 [18]93.

 the mission. We have three, and perhaps more,  babtisems to preform in the near future.    I should have written at an earlier date but was   waiting something definite to write a bout.  I am   extremely sorry a bout those tracts as we need  them very much. We have so much liberty otherwise   in this country.    Ever praying for the blessings of the   Lord to be with you.    I remain Your Brother   Don. C. W. Musser    P.S. I will have to ask you to please wait untill   I return to Constantinople for a Financial   report of this mission as I left the books   there.  I will say the funds have all been used   besides cunsiderable other money I have had  sent me from home.  I am ^also^ owing the mission  some.    Respectfuly  D. C. W.

 prayful study of the condition ant out look of   this mission, which is not yet opened up.  A few Aribs in this country, i.e. three, have been bap-  tised.  One of them, a sister, died in the church   the other two, brethern, are still in Jaffa and as   unfameliar with the requirements and bless-  ings of the Gospel as it was possible for   them to be before they were baptised.  They both  claim they were were promiced means to eme-  grate with on con ditions that they would be   baptised.  This seems to have been there only ob-  ject.  One of them is very dishonest and an   an ideler from the word go.  He has said a great   many meen things about our church, and   lately avoids me, almost as much, if not   quite, as he would a serpent.  When I do get a chan  ce to talk with him, which is not often, I cant   make him understand, though he speaks a   little english.  I will have to wait untill I can  talk his language before I can do any thing   with him.    There is an enormous work to be   done here, and I feel confident that now is   the time to be dooing it.  But how to make an   opening, seems to me to be the all important   question.  Might I offer a suggestion I would   say send out more missionaries, say six   for palestine, with instructions to proceed to   Jaffa, there employ a teacher and devote   your whole time to the study Arabic.  Our   elders could master the lang uage enough,   in one year, to enable to preach and con-  verse.  At the end of the first year send out six 
 to return to the mountain unless I wanted   to get sick, and, as I felt that this was the case,  I decided to com right up. I shall stay here   a week or so to rest and recruit up.    I have just finished letters to Prest Young and   to Bro Richard Haag of Salt Lake and as I know   of nothing more of importance to communicate at   present I will bring my brief to a close    Praying the Lord to bless you I remain your   Brother in the covenant of truth    Don C. W. Musser    I will add that Bro Herman is well and re  ports everything in good condition at Aintab  D. C. W. M.

 more elders with the same instructions  One of the first six would be able to teach those   who arrived last thereby cutting off one ex-  pense.  After a person learns the language   he can live here as cheap as any other part   of the world.  And after the mission began to   be opened up it would be more self surporting    The various missionaries in Palestine are   meeting with but poorl success.  They buy what   converts they get and pay high prices for   them.  The Catholics & Greeks haveing the most   money get the most converts.  Of course when   the pure Gospel of Christ, with its blessings   and gifts is introduced by humble and   authorized servants there will be a great many   of the honest brought to light.  A great many of   those who are anxious to serve the Lord for I beleave   they are here.  If the above course was persued, I   think in three years time the turkish mission  would be self surporting.  But if things are left  as they are at present, with one elder in this   whole reagion, and be unfameliar with   the language. I beleave the turkish mission   will remain undeveloped.  I trust you will   please pardon these few suggestions.    Now I wish to say a few words regarding   my labor which, at times, seems almost   to be in vain.  My progress is slow and the   opposition I encounter would be discourage-  ing did I not know I am engaged in the   Lord's cause.  My expences have been very high   and are high at the present writing, but it   seems I cant better matters in this respect. 
 D. C. W. Musser  Oct. 4 [18]92. 
 On the 30th of November I wrote to Prest Young setting   forth my desire to travel with out Purse & Scrip.  I said, among other things, that if he thought it   wisdom, I would send him what money   I had.  I havent received a reply from Prest   young but I have learned I cant travel with   out money.  I dont doubt the Lord for I know   I am the recepient of rich blessings from Him   every hour in the day, and were it not for His   spirit I enjoy, I could not stay here.  As I  said in one of my previous letters, I love   to tell people we mormon elders travel on our   own means, We pay all of our expenses from   our own pockets. We do not "preach for money and   devine for hire."  But my means have long since   been exhausted and I have no way of obtaining   more.  I am perfectly willing to give my   note for every cent of Church money I use,  while engaged in this work.  And I hope  that on this condition you will kindly   advance me more money.    Bro Herman is laboring with the Turks  and Armenians at Aintab & there a bouts.  He reports   everything "OK" though he needs a companion   the worst kind.  It is not necessary for   missionaries, laboring in that part of the field,  to understand German.    Hopeing to here from you soon, and begging   your pardon for this lengthy letter, and praying   the Lord to bless you I remain    Your Brother in the Gospel    Don. C. W. Musser  Jaffa

My dear Brother:    Your very welcome favor of the 20th instult.  came duly to hand. I was very glad to receive it. I have  written very fully to the President, and I thought it like-  ly that you would hear them ^letters^ read. It is scarcely   clear yet as to what Congress will do in our case.  The bill before the House is to give us a new  election law. This is a "Ring" Bill and iswas brought  or sent down by my contestant. I do not want to   see it or any other Bill ^of theirs^ become law. We are capable   of governing ourselves. The result to be gained by  the passage of these Bills is not concealed. The "ring"  say to Congress, "give us the legislation we want and  we will control Utah and settle the Mormon question  which vexes the nation." In other words, "Bind the Mor-  mon people hand and foot, give us control of them and  we will dispose of them." If the Lord is willing that   this shall be done, Congress, no doubt, will enact the necessary 
 legislation. But I have not yet received any intimation  that the Lord is willing to sSuffer any such evils to fall  upon us.    I have watched your proceedings in the As-  sembly with great interest. You have had, appa-  rently, a quiet time. If there be any conflict, I   suppose we shall hear of it toward the close of   the Session. I trust that your labors will be of   benefit to the Territory and satisfactory to yourselves.  The war against us will go on, I expect, until we are vic-  torious. But I do earnestly desire and yearn for the   time to come when we shall enjoy our full rights as   citizens under the Constitution; when we shall be free  from the yoke that our enemies seek to fasten us. The  Lord has made it light to us, or it would be unbearable.  Now for 28 years we have been in the Mountains, and   we have shown our capacity for self-government and we   should have the privilege of electing our own officers. I  believe the day is not far distant when we shall have greater  liberty than we have at present. Enclosed please find a letter  for Bro. Erastus Snow, which oblige me by handing to him if in the city;  if he has left, please send to him. I send it open that you may read some   items that may be of interest to you. With love to yourself and our mutual  friends and kind regards to your family, I am Your Brother, Geo. Q. Cannon

 Excellent letter. J.F.S.    CALIFORNIA MISSION   915 Golden Gate Ave. San Francisco, Calif.  Jan. 1st, 1898.    President Wilford Woodruff,  Salt Lake City, Utah.    Dear Brother;    I take pleasure in reporting to you the condition of the  California mission at the presant and for the year 1897 just closed.    There are now two well organized Branches; one in this city and   one in Los Angeles. These have a President with his counselors,  Elders, Priest Teachers and Deacons. Ladies relief and Mutuel Impr-  vement Associations, and Sabbath Schools. Sacramento has a Branch wi  with a Presiding Elder, but is without helps as there are not suitable   men to fill the offices at presant, but we hope to be able to com-  pleate the organization as the time rolls on; it has a good ladies   relief association and a good little Sabbath school. San diego has   a goodly number of Saints but is as yet unorhganized; though they ha  have a good sabbath school. There is also a Sabbath Sachool at Lat-  trobe in Eldorado county, composed ocf children of non membes   presided over by one of our local elders and hassisted by his wife  Their tsutuddies are entirely from our works obtained from Geo.Q.   Cannon & Sons Company.    During the year we have led into the waters of Baptism one  hundred and forty nine; these have been principally in the cities of   San Francisco, Sacramento, Los Angeles and San Diego; with a few in S  San Jose and Oakland.    The Elders are now traveling without purse or scrip in 20   counties; 13 of which have been opened up during the last year,   and while we are used well in most instances in all the localities   refered to yet aso far, but few baptisms have been recorded in any   of these counties; still there are many friends rising up on every   hand, and a warm welcome extended to the Elders in many places.    The Josephites are our most active opponants. Two of the El-  ders were recently 'Trap'd' by them. They were overtaken one day by   a carriage with two occupants and asked to ride; and on learning who   they were an invitation was given to attend a meeting at which it wa  was thought they would be able to speak to the people. On reaching th  the meeting house and the one who invited them began to speak they   discovered that he was the gGreat 'Elder Daily' of the 'Reorganized'  church, and our bitterest enemy. His whole speach consisted of a   string of horrors, laid at the door of the Mormons. At the clost ofw  which, Elder knight reached and took him by the hand and shook him  heartily and while doing so, turned to the audience and repeted the   wordsof the Saviour, Mat.5.44. At the close of the meeting many of   the audience came tand shook the boys heartily and asked them to   their houses while Mr. Daily looked and acted as though he had made   a mistake.    The News Papers have been fair in their treatment towarxds us   throug^ou^t the state in most instances; notably the 'Call' and 'Post'   of this city and the 'Fresno Republican' and several others in the 
 CALIFORNIA MISSION.    915 GOLDEN Gate Ave. San Francisco, Calif.    June 1st, D 1898.    President Wilford Woodruff,   Salt Lake City, Utah.    Daer Brother;    On my return from the general conferance at Salt Lake City, we  held our conferance in this city; April 17th and 18th. Quite a number  came from Oakland San Jose and Sacramento, and the meetings were well a  attended during both ^days^ of our conferance. The spirit of the Lord rested   upon the Elders, the Saints were instructed and the strangers haeard the  the Gospel.    After our Priesthood meeting, and the buisness affairs of the con-  ferance where adjusted I went to Los Angeles and there we held another  two day's conferance, April 24, & 25 which was another Grand sucsess.  I then visited San Diego and there we organized a branch, a Ladies re-  lief society and a primary association. There are about 60 members in   the branch which would have been organized some time ago but for the l  lack of suitable material of which to form a presidency. It is now in   good condition and ^has^ bright prospects before it.    The Los Angeles branch is becoming thrifty and strong; at this   lanst monthly Priesthood meeting there was 19 members of the local Pt  Priesthood president. They have a fine ladies Relief society, a mutual-  Improvment association, that has a weekoly attendance of 60 or 70 per-  sons, many of whom are investigators.  They have a good sunday School  and on the occasion of my last visit they had 29 little children and   larger boys and girls and Teachersa, about 50 all told. We cannot speak  so waell of San Francisco the middle and northern parts of the state   as of the southern portion. Why we do not know. The Elders are work-  ing hard and faithfully but an indifferance seems to exist and as a   consequence progress is slow. Some of the counties in the great wheat   producing parts of the state we have had to adbandon for the presant   on account of the terrible drouth that prevails all through that   portion of the state as so many of the people have had to leave for   other parts in order to make a living for the season. Of course it is t  the working classaes as a rule that are our best friends, and they a^are^   the ones that have had to seek employment else where.    On my return from the southern part of the mission I   went to San Jose and had an interview with Brother Keller the author 
 CALIFORNIA MISSION  508 Fulton St. Saln Francisco, Calif.  May, 10th, 1897.    President Wilford Woodruff,   Salt Lake City, Utah.    Dear Brother:  I take great pleasure in reporting to you the presant condit-  ion of thids Mission. Since my last report I have visited many parts  of the State and labored with the Elders in their several fields.  We held Conferance in San Francisco on the 11th of April and on  the 25th in San Diego. Reports from all the Elders make clear the  fact, that traveling in the Lords appointed waly-without purse or  scrip-is by far the most desirable; by it the Elders have access to  people they could reach in no other way and they are being treatd  well. They find no difficulty in reaching the people. Occasionally  they meet a 'Crank' or a 'Sore-head' barely enough to give var-  iety to missionary life.    The wokrk at Los Angeles has grown rapidly since my last  report. About 18 or 20 have been Baptized. On the 21st of April we  had the pleasure of organizeing the Branch there; prior to that tim  there had been but a presiding Elder there, but they now rejoice  in a Branch with a President and his councilors and members of  the lesser priesthood all in good working order. On the 7th of May  we organized the Ladies Relief association, and the Mutual Improve-  men association on the same evening; and as there is a good sunday-  school there, Los Angeles can now be said to be in a good, prosperous  condition. The Branch has 57 dgood active members and a bright pros-  pect for a number being added in the near future.    I have been out with the Elders in several parts fo  the mission, shareing with them the joys and fatigues ovf the missio  ary work; waklking and visiting by day and Preaching to good congre-  gations at night; and seeing for myself the way in which our Elders  are received and treated by the people; and it seems to me that a  wonderfull future lies before us and the only thing necessary to be  done, to bring hosts of good people into the fold, is, aided by the  spirit of the Lord, to work, work, work.    We now have a continuous line of Elders from San Francisco  to San Diego in the Coast Counties; and as the time rolls on, hope  to gather the fruits of our labors in the form of many souls brought  into the fold.    In the southern part of the State the Josephites, in Ogrange  county, haveing invited us to speak in their meeting-house, desired  that I should ^speak^ on the "Sucsession of the Presidency", at the close  the District President arose and said that he wanted all his local  authorities to give us therir meeting-houses in which to preach and   come out in force to hear us; that they wanted all the light there  was to be had on the matter. A most cordial invitation was extended  to us to preach in their meeting-house at any time:.
