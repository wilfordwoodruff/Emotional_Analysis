 Jaffa, Palestine, June 23rd 1889President Wilford WoodruffSalt Lake CityDearly beloved and much esteemed brother,It has been upon my mind these last daysthat I should write you a few lines andlet you know that I am alive and happy inthe discharge of my duties, although they arewidely different from what I formerly wasaccustomed to, as a clergyman of the world.  ButI thank God for His mercy towards me andespecially for the light He has given me through His chosen servants of the gospel.When I came here to Palestine, I was soonmade aware of the fact, that I was placed faceto face with millions of human beings, towhom the latter-day message has never sounded. I mean the Arabian speaking nations, who arescattered all over Syria, Arabia, Egypt and a largepart of Africa.  And my prayer to God was thatHe would lead me and make an opening bywhich the light of His gospel would shine through. And it appears to me that the prayers are nowbeing answered, in as much as I have ^found^ several 
 friends who diligently inquire into theprinciples of the gospel and some have alreadyapplied for baptism -- One of these inquirersI would like to make you and the brethrenat home nearer acquainted with.  He is Mr.Mousa Tannus, a man of high cultivationand much influence among his people.  Heknows perfectly besides his own tongue (the Arabic)Turkish, French, English and Greek.  A few yearsago, during a persecution which the Protestantssuffered in Syria, he rendered eminent servicein inducing the Turkish government to removethe instigators of the persecution from their of-fices.  I am now almost a daily guest at thehouse of this gentleman, and he has intro-duced me to ma^n^y people here in Jaffa andalso to a relative of his, the English Proconsulof Jerusalem, thus giving me a chance to bearmy humble testimony in many places whereI otherwise would have found no enterance. Yesterday I was called to a prominent familyand asked to lay my hands on and pray for a sick child.  I did so, and hope God will answer myprayer, to the honor of His name.  --Now Mr. Tannus has asked me, if it would not be con-sidered improper for him to put himselfin connection with the brethren at home by 
 the means of correspondence.  I have toldhim, I think not.  I suppose, on the contrary, that, if he would find time to write to youabout the country here, its inhabitants andprospects of evangelisations, it would be per-used with interest, and that you wouldalso find time to send him a friendly an-swer, encouraging him to go forward andtake the step fully out, as Saint of God.  Fora man in his position, it is no small thingto become a "Mormon" in this country, and I do not know, whether the Spirit can prevailover him or not.  But he is certainly very"nearly persuaded".  A word from home mightmaterially assist him.  I would also be veryglad, if some one at home would be kind enoughto present him with President G. Q. Cannon'sLife of Joseph Smith.  Because that is thevery book which he now aught to read.  I have not got it myself, or, I would gladlyhave given it to him.  I have given him"The Voice of Warning" and "Orson Pratt's works"I would also like to have the "Deseret News" come to him.  If the News Company will sendhim the Weekly for one year, that can be chargedto my account with the News.  His addressis: Mousa Tannus, Esq.  Jaffa, Palestine, Syria. 
 With respect to those Arabs who have askedto be baptized, I have thought ^but^ to [be] go slowly. I have formed a bible class and they come everyday and we read the Word of God and talk itover.  If they prove faithful, they will be bap-tized.  They are men of bright intellects, but no information.Well, I suppose I must no make my epistletoo long.  I with that ^God^ may bless you abundantly.  I also wish to be very kindly remembered to ApostlesF. D. Richards, Moses Thatcher, Henry Smith, whom I have the honor of personally knowing.If I may hope for a few words from you, mypresent address is J. M. Sjodahl, care of Henry Vocken-roth, Jaffa, Palestine, Syria.Your humble ServantJ M Sjodahl 
 Jaffa June 26, 1889.Dear SirLittle did I think few months ago, norcould I have even dreamed that I shouldnow be writing to the Honorable Presidentof the latter day Saints of Salt Lake CityUtah which fact I look upon as beingof a predestinated character inasmuchas am made to feel that I am in dutybound to be one of the Instruments in theforwarding to a certain extent the causeof the latter day saints in Palestine relativeto the speedy Advent of our Lord Jesus andthe necessity of true repentance whichI will endeavour by Gods' help to infuseinto the minds of the natives upon everyavailable opportunity: as regard myelfI dont see as yet the necessity of baptismthough on the other hand I think it isright that enquirers should be baptisedin due time in conformity with theordinances of the Church of the latter daySaints.Before I was acquainted with MrSjodahl I knew hardly any thing aboutthe Mormons until I read the books whichTo Wilford Woodruff Esqr.Salt Lake City, Utah TarU. S. of America 
 which he kindly sent me from Caiffa and after having carefully read them I was pleased to find that I became enlightened upon various subjects of which I was totally ignorant before, and now before going further to another subject I must here mention that for the last four or five weeks I have seen much of Mr Sjodahl and consequently I introduced him to several respectable families whom we visited several times in their respective houses and on each visit I could not help admiring the zeal and quiet manner ^which^ he exhibited in the propagation and elucidation of the truths of the Holy Scriptures and I was much gratified to find that his hearers were impressed by his teaching and therefore I am fully persuaded that by God's help the latter day Saints of Utah will live to see before long the fruit of the labours of their good Missionearies in Palestine fully realized provided that this all important testimony of the Advent of Christ will not cease from being speedily born to the millions who in these counties live ignorant therof in, 
 inasmuch as the teachings of the ecclisiastics of the Greek Orthodox Church and that of any other denomination except the ProtestantChurches have hardly any good impression upon the people.Vices are not exhibited as such,and what wee need is, men who by the power of God can teach the people the necessity of repentance on the strength of the Advent of our Lord. Being in this country, and having had during a long life much experience among my country-men, if I am allowed to make any suggestion as to the means that should be adopted inorder to secure success here I would as one important requisite mentioned that the Church should found here in Jaffa, a Centrum for their missionary work,a lot should be bought to sufficient for the erection of a meeting house or a school inorder that the people might thereby be brought into close contact with your people.Without 
 Without a meeting place it is not easy to reach the people, then if possible a tract of land should be procured large enough for establishing a Colony of Saints. There are already ^a^ few who express themselves as ready for baptism and more would be likely to follow when it become known that the work of the Church was really established here and the colo-nization would, I have no doubt, in course of time not only be the means of doing much spiritual good but also more than pay its expenses.There are several reasons why I suggest that Jaffa should be the centrum for missionary workand why an eventual colony not far from here.Jaffa is the principal Port of Jerusalem, Nablos (the capital of Samaria) and Gaza the most Southern City of Palestine and on the 
 the highway to Egypt. The Jews have already several Colonies round about here some of which cultivate yearly vast tract of land with vines and there is no doubt that the same will secure for them in due time immense profits. The number of pilgrims which pass through here to Jerusalemamount to many thousands yearly.Jaffa is a great mercantile place.From here is exported to England, Russia, Austria, and Constantinoplemillions of Oranges in boxes of ahundred each of large size every year. Formerly great quantities of grain used also to be exported to different part of Europe but of late years owing to the great export from America our export became insigni-ficantJaffa although like some Oriental Cities almost utterly neglected by the Municipal Authorities is one of the most healthy places in the Turkish Empire, meats, chickens,and vegetables can be procured at any 
 any time of the year at reasonable prices. The air outside the City particularly in the South, is very healthy. There is another point which in my jugdgment would be of great importance to a prosperous mission work among the people here. If you could by any means help a few of the natives over to Utah where they might find some work to do and in the mean time receive full instructions in the principles of the Gospel, some of them might by the help of God be of the greatest use in spreading the light of truth in the interior of the Country among the Villagers working under the direction of your own missionaries from Utah. What an unspeakable pleasure it would give me to see some of these men return and bring about a thorough conversion of some so called Christians to know the true God and seek repentance as I have already 
 seen in a case of a native ladyin whom I have observed such a great change since the Visits of Mr Sjodahl to her house and the testimony he has born of the truth of the Gospel. When I speak of helping them over, "I do so, because I know that without help they cannot go.Any assistance that I can lend in the furtherance of this cause I shall be glad to doPlease mention me very kindly to the Apostles who are at home and allow me to say that a few lines from you in reply to this, will be very much appreciatedBelieve me to be Yours most respectfullyM.

 Prest. Woodruff endorsed Bro. Mae-ser's remarks and commended his pray-erfulness as a worthy example for all teachers in the Church Schools. He referred to the tendency of the schools of the land towards infidelity, and exhorted the teachers to prepare themselves by humility and prayerfulness to combat this tendency by making our denominational schools successful 
 Prest. Woodruff said whatever leads to good is ofGod, and if good, is to come from this direction all is good. Satin [Satan] is on the alert and the practices spoken of are layingthe foundation for evil to future generations.  The parentsdo not realize this is of importance to children.  If this lady is gifted and can instruct mothers employ her.  Was will-ing to add his influence to anything that would put mothers and children on their guard. 
 Constantinople July 6th 1892President Wilford WoodruffSalt Lake City UtahMy beloved Brother!I am just in receipt of a letter fromPresident Young in answer to one I wrote stateing that it prehaps would be a good idea to leave this city for a season and go in to the interior of Asia Minor whare our saints are, and whare, as I understand it, there is a greater chance of dooing good. Our saints, I urged, need visiting and encourageing and besides I would have a better chance of mastering the language. And again there is an old sister in Haifa who is desireious of helping the work of the Lord and has promiced to pay to any one, authorized to receive the same, one thous-and franks to be used in the Turkish Mission besides a years' tithing. But Prest Young is cautious a bout accepting this money as the sister's children are not members of the church and they might raise some serious objections and, it may be,cause us some trouble. Since my letter I sugested it would be a good idea to visit this sister and as-certain just how matters stand, and if it would be unwise to accept the money we can explain to the good sister, and on the other hand, if every thing is all right we can receive the money.President Young thinks the idea a good one and I have, therefore, decided to leave Constanti-nople in a few days. But before starting I thought to pen you a few lines relative to the out look in this part of the vineyard, and, at the same time, to render an account of the funds sent here 
 to and in the furtherance of this righteous cause would not be out of the way.Long ere this, and, no doubt, with deep regret, you have received Elder Herman's report of our failure in accomplishing what at one time seemed so certain. But as I dident arrive here untill after Bro H's failure and as I dont know what he reported I have nothing much to write on this point. And as opinions are cheap it may be wisdom for me to keep mine to myself, but what I would like to say is this. That Elder Stauffer's going home, as he did, just when success was a bout to crown his labors and leaveing inexperienced Elders, Elders unacquainted with the maners and language of the people, was rather a mistake.And might I offer a suggestion. I would say send an Elder to this mission every six months,so that in the future there will always be some one here who can speak the language for before we are acquainted with the language we can accomplish nothing. I have great faith in the Turkish people if we could only reach them and I dont think the day is far distant when things will be so changed that we can reach them just as good as we can any other peopleand our labors will be attended with greater success. Even now our Elders can go and come just as they please and can preach just whare and when they please, and I beleave the Government will yet grant us the rights we are so anxious to obtain. I dont think it would be wisdom to try to do anything more regarding the publishing at present. It would be better to wait untill next year when I hope to be able to speak the language 
 and we can work more intelligently.After learning that the Government had refused us permission to publish our tracts in this lan-guage I decided to have some published any how for I thought by useing discretion we could circulate a few thousand a moung the people with whome we came daily in contact with out running any un-due risk and, at the same time, keep the work al-ready begun slowly moveing a long untill such time when we can enjoy more freedom.Accordingly I got questions from a Vienna house and place a trial order for two thousand tracts printed in the Armena Turkish language. The price, 8 1/2 pounds,I considered very expensive but it was the best I could do. After placeing my order, I learned that all second class mail was subject to examination by Turkish officials and when found to contain something the Government would not sanction it was confiscated. Now the only ^way^ I could do was to write and order our pamphlets sent by letter postage at an extra cost of 5 1/2 pounds. This makesour tracts very expensive still I think the money thus spent has been well invested.The enclosed statement with a few explanations will be easly understood. Prest Young said the mission would pay my railroad fare from Berlin 3rdclass but as the ride was 78 hours long I thought I had better travle second class and I did so paying the extra charges out of my own pocket744.00 Ps being 3rd class. "Our necessary liveing expences"enclude what we have had to pay out for food."Subscription to Osen Post." This a friendly German news paper and I thought it policy to subscribe for it and will charge the account to myself

 Uintah, Alleppo Feby, 17th 91Pres. Wilford Woodruff and ConsularsP.O. Box B. Salt Lake City Utah.Dear Brethern, Your in-teresting epistle of 10th ulto. was duly recived and contentsnoted with much pleasure. President Brigham Young had preveoiously informed us that you had authorized himto assist us by sending some elders and also with meansfor the purpose of publishing tracts, etc, both of which areare much in need of to be successful in spreading the Gospelamong these anxious, but benighted peple. In regardsto the subject of procureing Government grant which willprivilage us to preach and circulate tracts openly etc, I cangive no reliable answere as to what it will cost and how itmay be obtained, as that can only be learned at the capitol.I have, however, lately been informed of some points whichmay modify the ideas conveyed in my recent letters toPres. Young concuring the matter. For some time the AmericanProtestants exerted themselfves to stir up the people against usand to accuse us before the government to the end that theymight banish, or otherwise get rid of us, but as they didnot succeede in getting the other Christian sects to join themin their false accusation (which was neccessary to take effect,)they had to drop their plan, and thus we are left at libertyto continue our labors as before. The point I wish to makeis this, that all the different Protestant sects work on one government grant, which is possessed by the English Epis-copal Church. This grant privileges all Non-Catholic 
 Churches to proselyte throughout the Ottomen Empire, previding they can make such arrangements with theEpiscopal Church, which holds the grant. This, then, is oneway for pocureing a right to poselyte in Turkey. To obtain agrant directly from the government (from what I learn) willrequire considerable means (the am't cannot be asertained un-til the task is undertaken, as bribery is the common law.)The priveleges of a grant are effectual throughout the empireso far as preaching is concurned, but special grants are requiredfor building churches or school: hence I conclude that for colononizing ^also^ seperate grant would be required. As for publish-tracts, I learn that all that is necessary is to make arrange-ments with some printer, who, if there be nothing to interferewith Turkish politics, receives the right for printting anddistributing (tracts) may then be done without any dangerof trouble as far a the government is concurned, unless stiredup by Christians. This printing also can only be attendedto in Constantinople...We are pleased that our suggestions in regards to calling local brethern in to the ministry, were favorably accept-ed. There are several good faithful brethern who are becommingwell informed in the principles of the Gospel. To have one of themaccompany each of the Utah elders will certainly prove agreat help. There is indeed a great field of labor before us in this land and therefore room for a good number of eldersThe people in many places are anxiously awaiting the arrivalof some "Mormon" elders, to teach them in the ways of life. 
 Since my arrival in this place our numbers have been steadi-ly increasing. Have added eleven members to the Church bybaptism and there are prospects for many more. We are quiteregularly organized. Hold two meetings on each Sabath atmy room, and two during the week which are quite well at-tended. On Thursday Feby. 5th, we held our first Fast meetingMost of the Saints were presant and brought their offerings.They pay a tithe of all their earnings weekly or monthly as thecase may be. There is a good feeling generally among us andthus we hope to be able to teach by example as well as by pre-cept. ...Though none of the saints here are wealthy, they areall industrious and as yet only one has been in need of a littleassistence. It is strange to say that all of our members in thisbranch are males and most of them heads of families. We haveno poper place to receive dladies at our meetings, owing to thenecessity of two seperate departments for males and females toconform to the customs of the Orient. We are often envitedout to teach at evenings which is the only opertunity offordedfor ladies to hear our teaching (probably lady missionariescould do much good.)The saints in other branches of this mission were all feeling wellwhen I heard from them last. For a while the "Cholera" was the cause of much sorrow in these parts; but now good health pevalesgenerally. The saints join me in sending greeting to you andthe Church in general. Craveing Your assistence andprayers for in behalf of the Work of God in Turkey,I sign myself, Your Brother.Fredk. Stauffer

 #833 7th StLouisville Feby. 28 [18]92President, Woodruff & Counselors,Dear Breothern,I have just received a long letter from our friend and brother Binyad fromConstantinople, the substance of whichis that he has succeeded in getting rights for our church, that is the Sublime Porte has ruled that our appeal for liberty to worship and preaching the Gospel is in accordance with there laws and that the efforts of the Christian sects in opposing us were unconstitutional. He says that the cost of court and makingout the Charter are about $2575 00/100 i. e. 6500 piasters, which must be paid, then they can have as much printing done as they please, and have a representative at the Porte who will be paid from the Government. The right for building any house of worship would have 
 to be procured separatly. This charter will alow the cChurch to proselyte and distribute printed matter any-where in the empire. I suppose that Bro Schoenfeld has written you of the matter. Bro. Binyad has worked very faithfully for nearly a year without any pay, nor does he require anything for his labor. He requested me to try to get some one to make him a lone of about four or five hundred dollars which he will return with interest in a few months after receipt. He has had a law suit with his uncles for about ($25000-00/100) twenty five thousand dollars, which was decided in his favor by the Supreme courte after fighting it for seven or eight years. Now it requires about four or five hundred dollars to get a settlement. He is a charatiable fellow and I firmly believe that he will do much to help the 
 cChurch financially if he can but be assisted a little. Many of his aquaintences there would loan him money but for his religeous vi^e^ws.If you can do any thing for him I believe it would be safe and and also a great help to him.I know of nothing further to write you con curning the matter, but as I have had something to do with work there and still have the interest of the Orientals at herart, I felt it my duty to make the above statements.Am getting along nicely with my study of medecine,I Am as ever Your Bro. in the cause of TruthFred.

Stauffers letter, to the best of my Judgment and understanding. Our case is still pending in the Sultans Court, and I think it will be decided now in a few days, and I shall let you know with pleasure, when we have received a definite answere, wheather we have gained the object we have sought for, or not. I feel well spiritualey, and feel like filling the call made upon me to the best of my abileity, the only complaint I have at present is my health.

 Jos F. Schoenfeld 25 Jan. 1892 
 Jos. F. SchoenfeldAlbert Herman.Constantinople:January 27th 1892To the First Presidency:Salt Lake City.Dear brothern,Yesterday we had a thorough investigation by the aid of an Interpreter how Bro. Binyad, is proceeding with our case. In obtaining a charter, and the right to printin the Turkish language our Church works, so we have learned the following. That he must have im-mediately Three Pounds: which we gave him, to pay for the translation of the Book of Mormon, and the Doc. & Cov.Which he says had to done in order that the Turks could under-stand what our religion consisted of. 
 And last Saturday he says that they gave the decision in our favor to teach our religion, and print our Church works in the Ottomane Empire.But now to obtain the papers and to go through all the ceremonies of recording them will require Sixty five (65) Pounds more. Makeing a totale sum of Sixty eight (68) Pounds.Which he says will finish the work.But now the question arises what we shall do? The three hundred dollors which you have sent for the Mission is equivolent to Sixty six-42/10066-42/100 Turkish Pounds makeing nearly tow (2) Pounds short of the sixty eight. (68) which we need to obtain the Charter. Say nothing about the ten pounds for BroBinyads services. And the amount 
 what will be required to have the printing done, and what it will take for bakh-sheesh, which is demanded by the Turks. So takeing every thing into consideration, to gather with unforseen changes, which might take place in the Turkish Administration, for you never can tell what a thing is going to cost here, when its started untill it is finished, And then to have a little on hand to sustain some local Elders, as Bro. Stauffersletter says, whom we might call into the Ministrey after we have obtained the rights, will require nothing short of 20000 or 25000 Dollars more,so we have left the matter at present, with the understanding that we would write to you for further information concerning 
 this case. Bro. Binyad, has alsowritten to Bro. Stauffer stateing how the affair stands at present.And we will wait anxiously for an answere from you, at your earliest convenience. Dear brothern,I am sorry that I must inform you that on account of my continuealill health, Prest. Young did not think it wise for me to remain here.So he has transferred me to Switzer-land. So you may address your letter of instructions to Bro. AHerman. This is about all we have to say at present. Hopeing it will meet your approveal, please accept our kindest regards, And we remain as ever Your brothern in the faith,Joseph F. Schoenfeld.Albert Herman.

 521 1/2 6th Street San Francisco Nov 21, 1893Prest. W. Woodruff & Councilors,Dear Brethren: Lasst Thurs-day the 16th inst. I baptized Seven, Two new, one rebaptism & 4 children. Please answer the following question.Josiah Watson, joined our Church, Was ordained an Elder. His health was very poor, the Dr told him to go to California he did so. After he got here he joined the Josephites. After joining them he be-gan to Study the Doctrin & Covenants, became dissatisfied with them. He hunted me up I talked to him. He was convinced that he was wrong, and decided to come back. He was not cut off the Church. Question is his a new baptism, or a renewal of covenants? If the latter does he Still hold the Priesthood?My descission was a new baptism and of course if he lost his membership he lost his Priesthood.We hold meetings 11 a m & 7 p m on Sundays & at 7 p. m. Thursdays. We have Sunday School at 10 a. m. Sundays Our meetings are fairly well attended, a number of strangers are reading our 
 books, we do more by fireside chat than any other way. Our prospects are Growing brighter a good Spirit is with the Saintsand it is on the increase. But we felt a little Slighted when Prest. Cannon, was here, and also thought he gave us a "black eye" oin his opening remarks at conference on the 6th ult.I have good reports from the Elders in the Southern part of the State also from Sacramento. I enclose a letter from the latter So you can See.There are a good many people out here members of the Church, (Charlie Savage calls them "Old fossels") The most of them have become dried up but with constant labor & prayer, new lifeis moving among them, many of them are poor, and some have had to be helped from the fast day donations, Others their husbands are not in the Church and are very bitter. And the Sisters can't do as much as they would like to. But they are all feeling much better. There has been quite a little Sickness among the Saints, but in every instance where the Elders have been called in the blessings 
 of the Lord has followed our administra-tion. So we feel that we are greatly blessed by our Heavenly Father.I need more Elders, I need some good experienced ones, and they must be men with sufficient means to support themselves, I want you to send me more Elders. There are 56 large counties in this State, without going into Oregon, I want to devide the State up into con-ferences, with from Six to ten traveling Elders, and a conference President in each conference, So I can do very well with a good live, energetic, experienced, Elderwith plenty of means to Preside over each conference, for he can (if he has means so he can travel) get around among the Elders and Show them how it is done. I need at least five more Elders for the external Southern part of the State at once.Our financial condition here is not as good as I would like it. I have not been able to visit to the Elders going to lack of means. I will give you a brief account of our circumstances. While in prosperity in Ogden I was trying to place money so 
 that the dividends would be ample for the Support of my family's at home and to help me on my mission, for as soon as I had accomplished this I intended to report my-self ready for I love to work in the ministry where-ever the Sevan Servants of God Say to go. I secured stock & it was fully paid up, in Z. C. M. I., First National Bank, of Ogden, and the U. L. & T. Co.Bank of Ogden So that the dividends brought me anualy $676. It felt that this was hardly enough, So I invested in the Mercantile bus-iness, with brethren that I had confidence in to do this I had to borrow money. Well owing to the missmanagement, of others & dull times coming on, I lost it all about $15000. And Some debts still not paid. I feel know it was a loss but I think that it was robery under the cover of law, and not only did the money go but my name also, but I feel to say in the language of Job, The Lord giveth & the Lord taketh away and blessed be the name of the Lord. The result is I have no income for myself ^& family^ herenor my family at home.I hope you will not think that I write thus by way of complaint, but that you may 
 {shorthand}521 1/2 6th Street San Francisco Cal.Oct 6th 1893Presidents Woodruff and SmithDear Brethren: Yours ofSept 30th to hand. In reply will say, thatI was not aware that Brother Cummingshad written to Bishop Preston untill Igot your letter.Although you failed to find any recordof a letter sent me giving me instructionsabout the disposition of the tithing, I receivedthe letter all right, dated March 20 1893 &Signed Geo Reynolds Sec, which reads as follows: "Replying to your favor of the15th inst. I am instructed to say that noTithing or Temple Donations Should be readby any member of the Priesthood into whosehands it is paid except on an order fromthe trustee in Trust or the Presiding Bishop;and a record should be kept in eachmission, in which all the tithing paidshould be recorded."I will be as brief as I can and explainwhat I have done.On March 5 1893 I wrote Prest. SeymourB. Young, and ask permission to use thetithing that might be paid by the saints; 
 ^know^ the condition of things.The Lord softened and opened the heart of Bro. (Dr) VanDerBergh. So that we have a shelter over our heads and a hall to hold meetings in free of rent, which has made it possable for us to stay and open a mission here, otherwise we could not have done it but how long the Drs heart will remain open I don't know for he is a very queer man. I must not omit to mention Bro. Seymour B. Young who has sent me $130, So that we have been able to nearly live, when I say nearly I mean that we found friends here. We are owing Some here yet.I never felt better in the Gospel in my life. And I am Satasfied that a good work can be done here. As I Said I can begin to See a little of the result of our laborsand I want to continue laboring in the cause of Christ.Please send me more Elders right ay away. I learn that there are Saints enough in Los Angeles for a branch organization and as I have not the means to go there I want a good Elder to send there to preside so that he can attend to it. Kind regards to all. Your brotherJ. L. Dalton 
 at the time I wrote Sister Dalton was livingat Bro. James T. Garlick's in Sacramento, I askBro Young if it would be right for meto credit Bro. Garlick on tithing, for keepingmy wife. hHe answered me yes ^to both questions.^ And headded that I was to keep a record as yousay in your letter, should be done, all of whichI have done, Bro. Young letter bears date 15March 1893. A few days later I received Bro Geo.Reynolds' letter lrefered to above dated 20 March1893. On March 31st I sent a ^ful detailed^ report ofall tithing & Temple Donation, to Bro.Young, with a request that an appropriationbe made for the amount ($41.20/100) for thebenefit of the California Mission. All theTemple donations I have received I sentthe money to Bishop Preston & hold hisreceipt for the same. This $41 20/100 includes$10. I credited Bro Garlick with for mywife staying with them one month. I credited Bro. Garlick, on april 7 1893 an other$10. for my wife; This is all the tithingI have received up to date. I have receivedmission fund from the Saints here sinceAugust 22nd 1892, the sum of $51 25/100 I havealso received a little money from visiting membersof the church. 
 J. S. DaltonNov. 21 [18]93. 
 I received a letter from Pres. S. B. Youngacknowledging the receipt of the report ofthe tithing but he did not say whether anappropriation had been made of the amountfor this mission or not. If the appropriationhas not been made, I would be pleased ifyou would make it so that all may be keptstraight. That there may be no mistake I sendyou the report again. This is a copy of the reportsent to Bro. Young.   Nov 20, ^1892^ J. P. Jorgensen, Fruitval Alameda co. Cal.

 Orderville, Kane CountyUtah, Sept 25, 1880.Elder Wilford Woodruff,Dear BrotherSoon after the death of my Brother Joseph W Young the Trustee in Trust of the Church caused to be filed in the Probate Court of Washington County an account against the Estate to the amount of Four Thousand three hundredEighty five dollars and Seventy one cents (4,385.71)The greater part of this amount was for Substance drawn through the St George Tithing Office. There were other claims presented against the Estate to the amount of 18 00 dollars by persons who had been in Joseph W's employment, or who had loaned him small amounts. the Estate has paid 20 cts on the dollar in Stock—in the Canaan Co-op Herd—to these Parties,and have 8 00 dollars in said Herd that I am ready to pay to the Trustee in Trust if it is desired. But when I remember how dilligently Joseph W. sought to honor his calling, and how much of his life was given in building Zion, I am constrained to ask my Brethren to forgive him this 
 indebtedness, and to cancel the amount on File against him on the Records of the Probate Court.Dear Brother WoodruffWill you please enquire into this matter.I have written several times to Prest E Snow and once to Elder L. J. Nuttall, but duties of a more pressing nature seem to claim their time.

I have also had the privilege of meeting with most of my family and spending considerable time with quite a Number of my Children and many others my Daughter from Iowga whom I did not look for.

 PRESIDENT'S OFFICECHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST. OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS, GIBSON MILLER & RICHARDSON. OMAHA.P.O. BOX B.Salt Lake U. T. June 8, 1888Dear Brother & Sister CottamI received Brother Cottams Letter of May 3, & read it with much interest I am very glad if my Photograph is of any Satisfaction to Any body at Least my friends My health is about as usual I have gone cold in my head which affects my Hearing some you see we have had to bury Brother Snowwe done all we could to save him but He had to go, when I see so many going I feel as though my turn cannot be a great way off but I hop to be prepared I am still overwhelmed in business, my family are as well as usual Emma wishes to be remembered to you & all the families 
 I will say to Father & Mother Cottam should providence call me again to St George I certainly should be happy to accept of your kind offer In calling upon you for I never felt more at home or happier than while thare. And I very Highly Appreciate such Kindness and more Esspecially while in Exile. Yes Brother Cottam I have had many a happy Meal at Mother Cottams Table and spent many a happy hour in her Chamber which my record will show often my spirit  mingles with friends in the spirit world It may be thought strange for me to remarkthat it was a great relief to my spirit when my wife Phebe went to rest, she had become so feeble and worried so much about me, and the times, that she could no longer enjoyLife and almost the last word she spoke when dying she enquired if I was safe, her whole trouble seemed to be about me, and what-ever troubles I may be called to pass through I would rather pass through them alone than for Her to any Longer share them with me. I thank the Lord she is safe through her pilgrimage and rejoicing with her Children, parents & friends in the spirit world and she will ownly have time to visit awhile with them before I shall Join her. I pray the Lord to Bless you with health, Strength and peace that you may Live as long as you desire Life Your Brother in the Gospel L Allen 
 We had a good time in the dedication of the Temple I dedicated it first but did not stay to the public Dedication but the Saints had a glorious time and many manifestations of the power of God I expect Brother McAllister will be with you again soon. I have now in the Historian Office a Jerman Jewish Rabbi who has Lately joined the Church translatingthe Book of Mormon into the Jewish Language and when it is translated He wants to go on a Mission to the Jews and preach the Book of Mormon & the Gospel to the House of Judah He is deeply engaged in the work Dyer the Receiver is still hunting for Church property. He wants all the Church has ever owned since 1862 He says the Earth is the Lords and the fulness thereof and He is the receiver But I dont think He will take much of [it] with him down to the pit. God Bless you is the prayer of yer Brother Lewis Allen

 The following Remarks were made byWilford Woodruff:I feel to endorse the remarks and counsel given by Pres. Young, and the brethren, on this occasion. I do not believe that it is designed by our Father in Heaven thatany thing that has been given or organised for the buil-ding up of this Church, is ever to decrease, but to increase.While Pres Young was speaking of the little time we have to spend here, and of the great purposes of God to be accomplished, the thought struck me,how few there are, upon the face of the ^whole^ earth that have this work to do. When we compare the Saints of God with the world; our numbers are very few.  Out of twelve hundred millions of people who live upon the face of the earth we have perhaps, a hundred thousand of this people to-day, perhaps a few more taking women and children. A great work in this last dispensation 
 rests upon these few men and women, for the littl time we have to spend.A Female Relief Society was organised in the days of Joseph Smith for a purpose. I believe the Lord had a motive in view in inspiring Pres. Young to organise these Societies; they should increase. The Sisters have a great deal to do in this kingdom; and a great many things that are committed to their charge will prove a blessing to them, and to the community, and to the kingdom, ofwhen properly carried out.Pres. Young has referred to the subject of our fash-ions. I consider that the fashions of this people rest with the Sisters; especially with those that belong to the Relief Societies.  This counsel given to us concerning our lives and our acts is for our good and we should carry it out. There is allways something for the sisters to do. There is scarcely a month that passes but what something arises where a united effort of the sisters is good for the building up of the Kingdom.There is something coming now. You have the priviledge of uniting with the brethren in building the Temple of the Lord. You can help in this; and you have manifested in the past, by your works, that you can do something. There is a great deal to do. We want to build a Temple in Salt Lake City; and this is a work that the Lord requires at our hands; and the sisters can assist in this, as in all other works in the Kingdom of God.I never expect to see the time while I live in the flesh — there will no time — but what this kingdom will increase, and arise. God has decreed it: And no matter what position we are in persecution, in drivings, and with the wrath and indignation of the world upon us — it has increased and it will do so 
 When I look through this Territory, it does appear to me that the gentiles themselves cannot come here and look upon this Territory and people, without feeling that God is here, whether they acknowledge it or not. There is something besides the ingenuity of man; and I believe the Testimony of the Elders, the Spirit of God, bears record to our enemies, while here, of this work, that God is with it. This testimony come with it, more or less, wherever the Elders goIt is true the world reject it; and hence the Lord takes His Spirit from them; but the Lord does bear record by the Holy Ghost to them of this work. The building up of his Kingdom has to be accomplished. Zion has to prosper and be built up, and become a strong nation; and there will be no end to it until Christ comes.I feel to bless the sisters, as a Society, in this place. They have done well here; and their labors are worthy and the blessings of God will rest upon them. We have to be united together in the erection of this Church and the kingdom. We have the whole earth against us, and if the Lord has any friends on earth, they are here in the vallies of these mountains.I feel that we shall be protected in our homes and our rights, if we will do the will of God, no matter what that will may be. This people have never had the protection as a church, from the time of the translation of the Book of Mormon to the present day, as they have had since the Lord revealed and published the Patriarchol Order of MarriageThe Lord says you shall obey this. The world says you shall not do it. But in carrying it have we not been blest. We have had more protection since we have been in the valleys of the Mountains than before; and I feel that the Lord will protect us in doing right 
 and keeping his commandments. Woe be to that man or family or people that fight against Zion. Every weapon shall be broken that is raised against Zion. The Lord has sustained us over and over again against the opposition of forty million of people. He is laboring by faith. He has preserved us to the present time. Now this should be an evidence to us and to the world that the Lord has a hand in this work; and that He will protect this peopleLet us unite ourselves together, and the blessings of the Lord will be over us. We have been a little slow, perhaps, in carrying out the counsel to further the home products. I do not think that we, as a people, shall be any too soon independent of the products of babylon.  May God bless us, and may we receive these counsels, and carry them out in our lives. Amen

 131 1/2 Gough StreetSan Francisco Jan 2d 1894Prest. Wilford Woodruff & Counselors,Dear Brethren:  I enclose Financiel & Statistical reports for the year ending December 31st 1893.Dr J. P. P. Van Den Bergh, told me a little over a year ago that we could have a room to holdmeetings in rent free,  January 8th 1893 we held our first meeting in his house, and continued to hold them every sunday as well as week nights till December 17 1893.Last Spring we were in ^living^ Sacramento. I had to move from there,  I had no money to pay rent, so I ask the Dr if he would allow meus to live inthe rooms we held meeting in here in S.F. rent free, he said yes, and he put somefurniture into the rooms. (We had no furniture)On the 7th of last April I brought my wife down from Sacramento, and lived there ^in the Drs house^ tillthe 20th last month.  On the 4th of last month the Dr gave me notice to leave, I ask him his reasons, he said that he had nothing at allagainst me, nor my wife, nor children, but he did not want the meetings there any longer,farther than this he did not wish to say any thing only he wished to withdraw from the 
 Branch, and he wanted to have his wifes name withdrawn also.  He gave us two weeks to movein.  We have rented a house, at the above address wWe have rented a nice hall at # 927 Mission StreetWe are much better situated than we were be-fore, but we have rent to pay, and all our people are poor  we have about twenty active membersincluding children and of these some are sisters ^some^ widows, some with sick husbands, and some with their husbands out of the Church ^& are very much opposed to us^ and some of ^the^ brethren are out of work. So it will be hard work to keep up the rent ^ourselves^. Can you allow & send us $20 per month, to pay rent with? Untill we are able to take care of ourselves, which will be when our brethren obtain employ-ment.  The Saints do all the can for the support of the mission, but now we have an extra ex-pence on us, and before we had rent to pay we had all we could do to live and unless we can get a little, to help us with the rent I fear we will not be able to pay it and live.Kind regards to all, Your brother J. L. DaltonI understand an allowance has been made to cover the above named rent.J. F. S.[sideways text]J. S. DaltonJany 2 [18]94 [end of sideways text]

I cannot say that I feel thankful for it, forthe reason that I have labored undervery adverse circumstances, and it doesnot look like I have done anything.I am just begining to see a little ofthe result of my labors, and to leave itjust now it looks like I have not accomplished any thing, I would havemuch prefered to have remained here an other year, But I have made ita rule of my life to do, in the church-as I have been told, so I bow in sub-jection to what you say but not witha thankfull heart, but with many regrets. I will abide your council anddo as you have said.With kind regards to all,your brotherJ.L.

It will all come back in charge of the Territorial Exhibit and be labeled accordingly, including the things from the Brigham Young Academy, Provo, everything to go to Salt Lake City.Sister Caine says, there will be no special charge for our boxes. It may take sometime, however, before the turnfor the Utah Exhibit comes, to be shipped, until that time one of our Missionaries, if I should not be here then anymore, would have to see to the loading of our things into the car.I shall have a correct invoice of all the articlesand books shipped back, and settle with the

 firm of Geo. Q. Cannon & Sons for the books sold,at my return to Salt Lake. The large picture of the Salt Lake Temple, framed, but glass cracked across the middle, is a sermon in itself, and would do a great deal of good in the San Francisco Mee-tinghouse. Could it be left here? Tracts and Deseret News sent here for distribution, will be left with the San Francisco Branch, thus re-ducing considerable weight in our freight, and doing good here. The record of daily visitors at our Exhibit will be submitted to you on my return. It contains names of people from every clime upon the earth almost, and of some eminent men and women, all of whom have received my testimony in some shape or another, and the most of them have been presented with tracts. I take the liberty of suggesting, that a copy of "Analysis of the Book of Mormon" should be given with aevery copy of the Book of Mormon to be sold, and also the "Story of the Book of Mormon"urgently be recommended to the purchaser.I have found here these two ^to be^ great auxiliaries to my testimonies concerning the authenticity of the Book of Mormon. Among the tracts placed at the disposal at this Fair; I have found, "The Modern Prophet" and "The Plan of Salvation"to be the most available.

San Francisco, July 27, 1894.President Wilford Woodruff.Dear Brother,Having been set apart for my mission to California,at the Historian's Office, Friday, January 20th, last, I started, accompanied by my daughter Ottilie, for my destination,Monday, January 23, and arrived at San Francisco, Wed-nesday, January 25. Elders John L. Dalton and Ezekiel L. Blod-gett recived me us at the landing with whom I shortly after proceeded to the Midwinter Fair Grounds to present my letter of introduction to Mr. Badlam, Secretary of the MidExecutive Committee. It gives me much pleasure to report to you the uniform kindness with which Mr. Badlam has trea-ted me in consequence of which all preliminary arrange-ments for our educational exhibit were greatly facilita-ted.The Exhibit.A place ^space, 15 x 17 ft^ on the North Gallery of the Liberal Art Buil-ding, had been assigned us, by th and we proceeded at once to dedicate that place in a quiet and undemon-strative manner. One of the bretheren of the San Fran-cisco Branch was engaged to put up the fixings undercontract, and in a few days we were ready to 
 Office of theGeneral Board of Educationof the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.WILFORD WOODRUFF, PRESIDENT.KARL G. MAESER, D. L. D., GEN. SUPERINTENDENTGEO. REYNOLDS, SECRETARTY.The California Mission has at present beside my-self, Bros. Williams, Keller, and Blodgett, as Missio-naries, of whom the latter two ought to be releasedto return home. These bretheren, although faith-ful man, are, it seems to me, entirely nonsuitedfor this peculiar field of labor. There is a spiritof selfsufficiency prevailing among the people ofCalifornia, and San Franciscan in particular, thatcauses people to look with supercilious contemptupon any man attempting to teach or preach thatdoes not come up to their standard of intelligence.A man, laboring here as Missionary, needs muchwisdom and some experience, or else, he is simpl-ly "walked over". Bro. Williams would do as avaluable assistant to a President of the Missionthat would be able to carry on a vigorous cor-respondence with scattered members throughoutCalifornia, engage the attention of men of edu-cation and refinement, and exercise a kind ofmagnetic influence upon the public meetingsof the Saints. If this Mission shall ever be strongand extensive, great care will have to be 
 commence our labors in representing to the people the spirit and status of the Education among theLatterday Saints in Utah. To this end the leading institutions of our Church School Organisation had been communicated with and promisesfor cooperation had been obtained from the Brigham Young Academy, at Provo, and fromthe Latterday Saint College, at Salt Lake.  Dr. James E. Talmage also contributed from his own private collection rare specimens of microscopic views.All of these were to be augmented by a large con-signment of the principal publications of our Church by Geo. Q. Cannon & Sons.For some unexplained reason much delay wasexperienced in obtaining our boxes from the East and our exhibit remained empty until Saturday, Febr. 24, when a portion of them were received, put up, and made ready for opening the exhibit on Monday, Febr. 26. It was a very in com-plete exhibit, as far as the educational part was concerned, for none of the things from the Brigham Young Academy had arrived yet.   But the specimens in Drawing and Penman-ship from the Latterday Saint College; and Bro. Talmage's photographic views, with the Sunday School Charts helped me out considerably in that line, although compared with the other educa-tional exhibits of Santa Cruz County, St. Mary's College,Mills College, Deaf and Dumb Institute, and the 
 taken in the selection of the suitable men forthis somewhat peculiar field of labor.The Local Priesthood with Bro. Mortensen,as Branch President, at their head, are beginningto be aline to their duties, in which Bro. Mar-tensen is leading out most energetically. The largemajority of the Saints, 43 registered, are peoplethat have drifted away from Zion for somereason or another, and are being labored withaccording to circumstances, to bring them to arealisation of the requirements of the Gospel. The"Josephites" have been exercising a most per-nicious influence among them formerly.There are several people investigating the principles of Mormonism, and the attendancesof strangers at our meetings is gradually increasing. It will be a hard pull, financially,for this Branch to raise their monthly rentafter the Midwinter Fair is over, as the con-tributions from visiting Saints from Utahand Sister Caine's Tithing will then cease, allof which have been the main source of incomethus far. I am now anxiously awaiting your instructions in regard to what is to be doneafter July 4th with this Mission.With kind regards,Your brother in the Gospel,Karl G. Maeser

REYNOLDS, SECRETARY.189University of California, all adjoining ours on the same gallery, we stood as yet a poor show. The church-works made a fine display though, and were assisted in that by the grand picture of the First Presidency, the large picture of the Temple, representations in frame of the Latterday Saint College; the Utah Sugar Works, and a large album with the portraits of our Leaders.All these furnished me abundant material for ex-planations and testimony. Notwithstanding theas yet incomplete representation of ours education-al status, visitors commenced to increase daily innumbers and began to manifest greater interesteither pro or con as time went on. After severalweeks of vexatious delay the contributions from theBrigham Young Academy finally arrived and lif-ted us at once upon an equal footing, educationallyspeaking, with the other exhibits on the gallery.Foremost among the B. Y. A. specimens more the twolarge cases of Carving Work, of the "Pocket Knife Class"as Professor Townshend, who has charge of that de-partment there, calls it. There was nothing like it inthe Midwinter Fair, as claiming to have been done 
 by beginners in that line of work, and the comments on it were frequent and in high terms. Specimens of Normal ^and^ physical diagrams,penmanship, and drawings made up the balance.Our exhibit being thus complete, as short time of notice, limited preparations and circumstan-ces could possibly make it, a large sign in front of our booth with the legend "LatterdaySaints' Educational Exhibit", gave notice to all visitors who we were. A book of visitors was opened, into which many, about 1200, have inscribed their names. There are names from Japan, Australia, India, Palestine, Egypt, Italy, Greece, Turkey, France, Germany, Scandinavia, England, the United States, and Sandwich Islands, names of many creeds, and of all classes of society in it. With very few exceptions, each one of them has heard my testimony, and a great many more, that did not write their names. Our exhibit was opened daily at 9 AMand closed at 5 P. M. as all other educational exhibits did. We did not open on Sundays, as I had been instructed to do, as Bro. Cummings, who should alternate with me Sundays, was called home, and I had noone else competent to be trusted with that work and my labors seemed to be indispensable at our Sunday meetings and Sunday school.

REYNOLDS, SECRETARY.189The fair closed officially on July 4th at midnight. Asall educational exhibits commenced packing up the day following and nothing but confusion and noise, dust, and turmoil was going on on the gallery, I was obliged to follow suit and closed up also. With the assistance of Bros. Blodgett and Williams, our two missionaries here, Bro. Mortensen who had put up our fixings, packed up the boxes and I had themconveyed to the Territorial Exhibit in charge of Sister Caine at the Mecashine Hall, from where they will go to Utah with the rest.The Mission.Soon after my arrival at San Francisco I found that the California Mission was in an unsatisfactory con-dition which had just a few days before culmina-ted in the disgraceful episode of Greenwell's convic-tion for defrauding his employers. He was the Presi-dent of the Branch and Bro. Dalton mhad manifes-ted such lively interest in Greenwell that he laid himself open to suspicion among the Saints.  The papers were full with articles against this "Mormon scandal", and the Josephites, who thus far had 
 the upperhand here, made the most of it. Our meeting place, 927 Mission Str, was in an undigni- fied locality, with crowds of loafing and smok-ing Socialists holding their meeting on the ground-floor at the same time, and crowding at the entrance, thus forcing ladies wanting to come to our meetings, to push their way through the best they could. The Saints were discouraged through having to carry ^in part^ athe family of the President, for which the small bBranch was not prepared.  To the credit of Bro. Dalton it must be stated,however, that he has labored hard and unceasing-ly to work up this mission. His misfortune was that he had a family on his hands, where he should have been free from such anxieties, and that he had called for more missionaries than there was work for them, and finally that neither he nor his missionaries, with the exception of Bro. Cummings and to some extent, Bro. Williams, were exactly the kind of men needed in this peculiar field of labor. Of great assistance to us were our visitors to the Midwinter Fair from Zion who rendered us financial help by their liberal contributions.

REYNOLDS, SECRETARY.189Our Sundayschool has been reorganised and brought into greater conformity with the  pl instructions given by the S. S. Union Board and General Super-intendency. My efforts in organizing a Relief Society here, have thus far not been successful, but we are conducting now a testimonymeeting every Thursday evening, which is also attended by strangers.The removal of our meetings to our new quatrters to the "California Mission Chapel" 29 Eleventh Str, has been a great step in advance, and our mee-tings are well attended now by strangers, and in-quiring friends. A Choir has been organised, antaught, and conducted until last week by my daughter Ot-tilie. Since her return home, I have had to take charge of it myself the best way I could in singing and playing the organ, being assisted in this work by Bro. Hyde, of Ogden, who is attending here the Medical College. As the rent for this little chapel is $3000 permonth, and nearly $500 more for the rent of the organ,gas, and water, but Bro. Mortensen is paying $1000out of it for rent of the basementrooms, there are still $2500, to be raised monthly. $1500 have 
 been subscribed for thus far as monthly con-tributions by members of this Branch, one half of whom are women, either widows or married to outsiders. This will be a serious question to be solved, as thus far the assistance rendered ^us^ somaterially rendered us by visitors to the Mid-winter Fair and $900 Tithing monthly fromSister Caine, will cease. As there are severalparties investigating the Gospel and some areready for baptism, some hope is entertainedthat are increase of contributions can belooked for at an early day. The work has nowbegun, and many that have drifted intothe Josephite Church are beginning to reflectand discover that they are on the wrong sideof the fence. Much now depends how this awa-kening is kept up, and that the Lord by HisHoly Spirit may bless and assist the labors ofHis servants in this Mission in the future to thesalvation of many souls, is the prayer ofYour brother in the Gospel,Karl G.

S.After the departure of Bro. Cummings for home, the Branchat Sacramento was left in charge of Bro. Keller whose personalacquaintance I made several weeks later. Bro. Keller beingentirely inexperienced in writing, it was with much difficul-ty that I could gather some information about the conditionof the Saints there the more so as it was impossible for meunder the circumstances to pay them a visit. It appears,however, that the little life existing in that Branch wentgradually down as soon Bro. Cummings had left, andBro. Keller was utterly discouraged, hence my request forhis release. Two efficient elders may be able under divineguidance to revive the work.Bros. Williams and Maycock, laboring in San Bernar-dino and vicinity, reported to me regularly their labors.From their letters it became apparent however, that theJosephites were having things their own way in SouthernCalifornia, and that these young missionaries weresimply walked over. This opinion was shared by EldersLyman and Roberts during their visits in SanBernardino, Las Angeles, and San Diego. Both youngbretheren, therefore, by your instruction, were transferred 
 to San Francisco, and Bro. Maycock shortly after releasedto return home, where he suddenly died of heart disease.Bro. Williams is now laboring with me here, and is provinghimself a faithful man, engaging the confidence andrespect of the Saints. His strength shows itself chieflyin his visits among the Saints, as he is not a fluentspeaker in public. Bro. Blodgett has gone home withhis honorable release, where his presence is urgentlyneeded.By the kindness of Apostle Brigham Young I havebeen regularly supplied of late with the Daily DeseretNews; while Apostle Lund has sent me regularly theMillennial Star; all of which has been of muchcomfort and assistance to me, and has beengratefully appreciated.Bro. Jas. H. Crockwell, the photographer, now here onbusiness, has kindly taken photographic views ofour Educational Exhibit at the Fair, and of theCalifornia Mission Chapel, the negatives for whichare now in the hands of Bro. Savage for reproduc-tion.As the San Francisco newspapers charge invariablyfor a short church notice 60 cents, we had soon togive up advertising in that way, the more so as wedid not notice any particular attention being paidby the public to that mode of advertisement. We havenow cards printed for distribution with the aArticlesof Faith on one side and a polite invitation withplace and times of meetings on the other.Karl G. Maeser.[sideways text] K. G.

 On the 22nd day of July 1839, Joseph the prophet having beensick for several days, & his home & Door yard containg many of the sick saints who had Been driven from Missouri. Joseph arose from his bed with the power of God Resting upon him And He took the sick by the hand & in a loud voicecommanded them in the Name of Jesus Christ to arise & be made whole & he healed all that were in his house & around about He then took some of the Twelve with him & walked up the River bankabout a mile & healing all that were sick as he went along & they were may among the Number was Elder Sherwood who lay at the point of Death. He crossed the River to Montrose went into the Home where BrighamYoung lay sick & healed him, who walked out of the Home & followed him. The prophet came to where I was standing & told me to follow him I did so we then went into the Home of Elijah Fordham who was at the point of Death, his friends had looked for him to breath his Last for several hours. He had lost his speech & nearly his breath. we walkedinto the Room Brother The prophet Joseph took brotherFordham by the Hand & looking the dying man in the Eyes for several moments. He them said Brother Fordham,in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth I comndyou to arise & be made whole. The voice of the prophet was like the voice of God it seemed as though the whole Home shook from its very foundation And the man leaped from his bed & was made whole instaneously He kicked his pettiees off from his feet, dressed himself Eat a Roll of bread & milk & followed us out of the House & went into the House of Bates Nobles who was also very sick the prophet Healed him & we knelt down & pryd & gve thanks to God. The wicked became alarmed at the seeingthe power of God and followed to see what the End wouldbe After the propht Had healed, all the sick saints in Montrose He with several of the Twelve & S. Rigdon went 
 to the ferry to Return to Nauvoo. A Gentile came to him & asked him if He would not go out into the country some two miles & heal a pair of Twinn chldren about 3 months old both of which were vary sick. He said I cannot go but I will send a man, who will do just as well. He Turned The prophet Turned to me & said you go with this man & teach him & his Houshold the princplesof faith in Christ then lay your hands upon the Chldren & heal them in the name of the Lord At the same time handing me a silk Bandanna red Hankerchief & said wipe their faces with that Handkerchief & they shall get well ^and as long as you will keepthis Handkerchief it shall ever remain as a league between you & me^ then the prophet returnedhome & I went & done as I was Comma[nded] & the children were healed. The deeds of this day showed me more of the power of God in healing of the sick than I ever before saw in the Church & kingdom of God in any dayof my life. I still keep the Handkerchief in memory of the prophet Joseph 
 London Oct 18, 1840, Sunday G. A. Smith & myself met at Father Cornors & held three meetings though the day and Eveningwe red in the book of Mormon, broke bread to the Saints. I felt the Spirit of God bore testimony to me that there would be a great work in LondonWe retired to rest in good season. I felt well in my mind and slept untill about 12 oclok at night I awoke and meditated upon the things of God untillabout 3 oclok in the morning and while forming a Determina-tion to warn the Inhabitants of London, & overcome the powers of darkness which were besetting us day by day and trying to overcome us. As I was forming this determination in my own mind A personage appearedunto me which I considered was the prince of Darknssdarkness or the Devil. he made war with me and attemptdto take my life He laid hold of me like a strong armed man. I felt like the wait of a heavy man lying upon my body and he caught me by the thoat with a strong grip and choaked me nearly to death I struggled with him as one man would struggledwith another I felt as though this destroyer would ovecomme & that I must die as I saw no way that I couldEscape his grasp, at that instant the thought came to me why do you not pray, & call upon the Lord for help. I them asked the Lord in the name of Jesus Christ to deliver me from the powers of the Devil & preseve my lifeinstantly three personages came through the door drapd in white with considerable light surrounding them they came up to the bed side where I was lying in the graspof the Enemy & they laid their hands upon my head & inthe twinkling of an Eye I was liberated & the spirit of God vibrated my whole body from the crown of my head to the soulsof my feet and I was instantly covered all over in a light state of perspiration water stood upon ^me^ in drops As soon as I could speak I spoke to GBroth G A Smith & I foud that he had been Laboring under the same 
 difficulty the same power of the Destroyer had been seeking his Life as well as my own, and he was delivered in the same way. The three personages that appeared unto me one was a tall man I shoude think over six feet the other middle one was anothe man was medium size & the 3rd was a short man they wee all dressed alike Neither of them spoke a word to my hearing but as soon as they laid hands upon my head & I was delivered they disappeared. I felt thankful to God for the presirvation of my life. (Brother Tullage Record this in one of the Blank pages & Refer to the page)Oct 7th 1840. In company with the Twelve and manyother Saints I attended a Discussion in the Evening held at the Carpenters Hall, Garrett Road, Manchester.  One MrBarrett had tried hard for a length of time to getsome of the Twelve to hold a discussion with him. th[r]ough his continued teazing president Brigham Young told himthe Twelve would not stoop to discuss any subject with him but if he must discuss the subject of MormonsmHe would appont some bo[d]y to meet him as Mr Barry would not take no for an answer Brothe Alfred Cordenwas apponted to meet him Brother Cordon as it were was a Beardless boy yet he had been ordand an Elder & possessed much of the Spirit of the Lord And they met for this purpos at Early candle light. The Stand was occupied on one side by many Methodist priest, & on the othe side by the Twelve Apostles & Elders. The Home was lightby 3 chandeliers with 12 lights in each lighted with gass there was some 1500 people present. Mr Barrett pledged him-self to prove the Book of Mormon Fals & water Baptism ^not^ Essential to Salvation while Brother Cordon pleged himself to prove the Book of Mormon true & waterBaptisms essential to Salvation. As Mr Barrytt arose & declgaired to the Assembly that He would prove the Book of Mormon Fals & watter baptism not essential to Salvation 4 ^glass^ chimney in each of the chanderliers burnt 
 to peaces & the glass flew among the congregationAnd the man who had tended the gass in that Hall andfor twenty years said he had never knowany weirder of the kind. the chimneys were replasced & the discussions went on I set by the side of DoctorW Richards and at the commencement of the meetingA very interesting old gentleman apperd in the congrega-tion he sat at the end of a seat going the ally nearthe platform. He made me think if what he s is said ofthe Ancient of Days his hair was white as wool & restedin a large white roll upon his shoulder, he was a noblelooking man he Eyed us with great interest &penetrations, he occupied his seat to our view forsome half an hour I called the attentions of DoctorRichards to him we both looked at him with feelingsof both Interest, some little disturbance in another partof the Home attracted our attention & when we returned our eyes to the seat of our interestng visitoras we found his seat vacant, & he had disappeardthen for the first time we felt that we had beenvisited by John the Revelator or one of the thee Ancient Nephite, However the discussion went onMr Barrytt was confounded, & Elder Cordan gainedthe victory, & quite a number of the methodist whoattended that discussion wer Baptized & joind the LatterDay Saints. 
 Autobiography of Wilford WoodruffThe remaining months of the year 1841 was spent by the Twelve, after their return from their successful mission in Gto Great Britain, in settling their families in Nauvoo and taking charge of the affairs of the affairs Church. Several noteworthy events took place at this time among which were the dedication of the baptismsmal font in the Temple by the Prophet and the Twelve and the first adminis-trations of the ordinance of

 TULLIDGE'SQUARTERLY MAGAZINE.No. III.—APRIL, 1881.—Vol. I.UTAH'S COMMERCE AND CO-OPERATION.CHAPTER I.THE INITIAL VIEW OF OUR COMMERCE.THE history of Utah commerce isvery unique. In some respects,there is not a State or Territory inAmerica whose commercial history willcompare with that of our Territory. Itscharacter has been as peculiar as its com-monwealth, and that has given to it atyping quite uncommon in its genius;yet the typing in accord with the co-op-erative policies which the age has de-vised in solving the problem betweencapital and labor. There is also muchstirring romance in its history. Itsstory and incidents are almost as roman-tic as the commerce of Arabia whosemammoth caravans, in their journeysacross the deserts, have given subject andnarrative to the most gorgeous romancesin the whole range of literature. Thejourneys of the trains of these merchantsof the West over the Rocky Mountainsand the vast arid plains between SaltLake City and the Eastern States, andtheir arduous task and adventurous ex-periences will fitly compare with the his-tory of the merchants of the East in old-en times when civilization herself wasfostered by commerce; and, moreover,in the early days of Utah, it took asmuch commercial courage, perseveranceand ability to establish the commerce ofthis Territory as it did that of any na-tion known in history. On the veryface of the record, we may discern thatthe men who did this work were no or-dinary men. They were capable of mak-ing their mark in any land; and if Utah,in the early days, afforded them great op-portunities, it was their boundless ener-gies and commercial ambitions that firstcreated those opportunities and made apeople comparatively affluent who hadbeen buried in isolation and in thedepths of poverty. Thus considered,the biographies of our commercial menhave a peculiar charm of interest whichgives a dignity to the personal record oftheir lives far above that of the ordinaryhistory of self-made men and successfulfinanciers. Indeed, the history of ourcommercial men is substantially the his-tory of Utah commerce.But the initial exposition of Utah com-merce is undoubtedly that derived from her peculiar commonwealth, and the ex-traordinary history of the Mormon peo-ple who settled these valleys; and thiswill lead us directly through variousphases of development to the commercialculmination to be illustrated in "Zion'sCo-operative Mercantile Institution."To type our commercial history for thepopular understanding, it may be de-scribed as Israelitish; and so its char-acteristic inscription of "Holiness to the Lord" is neither fanciful nor presumptu-ous, but fundamental and typical. Itmay be confessed that the inscription hasbeen often burlesqued by the "Gentile;"but the sociologist would quickly read init a volume concerning the genius andcommonwealth of a people expressed ina gigantic commercial institution which,in its vast activities, influence and specialmethods, may become famous as thegreatest marvel in the history of moderncommerce.And, just in this initial view, we mustkeep in sight the men who founded theInstitution and especially those who arethe proper representatives of the com-merce of the Mormon people. It wouldbe a very false-sighted view to consider"Z. C. M. I." as a colossal commer-cial monument of the Church apart fromthose commercial founders. That insti-tution, in fine, is the organic embodi-ment of the life-activities of such men asWilliam Jennings, William H. Hooper, Horace S. Eldredge, Hyrum B. Clawson,William C. Staines, Godbe and Mitchell 
 Pres. Woodruff then addressed the con-gregation; commenced by saying—good morning,God bless you all. Some sixty years ago I firstheard the sound of the gospel of the son of God.I invited the Elders home with me to spend the night.I read the Book of Mormon most of the night, andin the morning went to a stream of water and wasbaptized: had been taught under Presbyterianministers all through childhood, but hungered for the gospel of Christ and His apostles; andwould have walked hundreds of miles to beholdan Apostle. Contrasted his visit through the stateof Illinois during the past summer, with the dri-vings and persecutions of the saints in the year 1834.Exhorted the sisters to diligence and faithfulnessin their labors, though they are sometimes heavyall the organizations are of God; the younger gene[page torn]ation must bear off the kingdom; Let us be care-ful and watchful of their teachings. He closedhis remarks by asking the blessing of our heavenlyFather upon all. 
 Pres. Woodruff said the church of Christhas been set us again for the last time, it has been or-ganized for 63 years, and yet we are only a handfulcompared with the world at large. But the eye of Godupon us, and the hosts of heaven and of this world too,are watching us. Then what manner of men, women,and children should we be; we should be saints indeed,and strive to live every righteous principle, in an ac-ceptable manner before God.The Relief Society was organised by theProphet Joseph Smith in an early day, for a purpose:that of love and charity for the sick and hungry; andthey are doing a noble work in this direction. Thesisters have rights which the brethren should sustain.They have been called by revelation to store wheat againstthe time of famine, and we should sustain them in this call.We must improve our time, for we know not theday nor the hour when we will be called to labor beyondthe vail. The evil one is ever watching to lead away anddeceive the young and inexperienced; and we must beprayerful and humble and on our guard at all timesand shun vice and even the appearance of evil.We have one of the most glorious blessing thatany people can enjoy; that of working for the dead. I havehad the privilege of working for the redemption of overfour thousand of my relatives and friends in the spiritworld. I exhort you to faithfulness in this grand work,an in every labor you are called to perform. 
 CALIFORNIA  MISSION612 VanNess Ave. SanFrancisco Cal.Jan. 1st 1897President Wilford WoodruffSalt Lake City Utah.Dear Brother;I arrived in SanFrancisco nov. 15th and was cordially recei-ved by President Tanner; who started for home Nov. 24th. Untillthen I took no active part; but proceeded to make myself as wellacquanted with the situation as the circumstances would admit of, in that length of time: I found that the Elders wereGrouped together,in places about as follows. Seven at SanFrancisco; five at SanDiego, five at Los Angeles, four at San Jose, four at Sacramento, two at Latorobe, and two at River-side. They were hiring theirown Rooms, in each place; buying their own food, and in some instan-ces cooking it. The actual time spent among the people distribut-ing cards, and Tracts, was from three to four [illegible] hours [illegible]each day. It did not seem to me that this was the most profitableway to work: accordingly as soon as President Tanner bid us adeauI got the Elders together who were laboring here and discussed wi[th]them the situation, laying before them the necessity of travelingin the Lords own appointed way.With-out purse or scrip.After this I went to San Jose and aroused the Elders there on thesame question; I then went to Sacramento and took up a labor the[r]ewith the Elders. On my return I issued a circular letter to allthe Elders, of which I here-with enclose you a copy that you may sesee by what means I have reached the preasant conditions. The re-ssult was, that several of the Elders anounced themselves ready totake the field. We met together, and after prayer and supplicationbefore the Lord, two were appointed from San Francisco, to Salinas,Monteray County; Two from San Jose, to Hollister, SanBenito Coun-[illegible] ty; and two from Sacramento, to Napa City, Napa County.Opening up new fields.This was all new ground upon which the Elders had not trod.In the lower part of the State alike course was persued; the group-es have been scattered by 2's, the head-quarters have been brokenup; and now, six pairs of Elders are traveling absolutely with-outpurse or scrip. All the others are moveing steadily in that direct-[ion].The reports that have reached me from those Elders that have aris-en to the true standard of Missionary life and labor, are of themost incourageing nature; they are often entertained at the bestHotels. Opera-houses, Churches, Halls, and School-houses, havebeen provided repetedly. News-papers have advertised their Meet-ings free. Friends have been raised up who administered to theirwants and on their departure bid them wellcome to return. Manyhave listened to the truth that could not have been reached by theother system.The Elders declare they have not gone hungry, or needed a 
 CALIFORNIA MISSION532 Castro St. San Francisco Cal. March 1st, 1897.President Wilford Woodruff,Salt Lake City, Utah.Dear Brother;With a desire to let you know the presant condition of theMission I write. On the 9th of January I started on a tour Southand visited that part of the State. I found that the Elders wereall traveling in the Lords appointed way, traveling without purseor scrip, except such as had their Wives with them, who ofcourse wewere keeping house. I visited all the Elders, and examined theirmode of presenting the Gospel, and gave them such instructions asseemed to be necessary, that they might be able to handle the Scriptures into the best advantage in teaching the doctrines of the Church,all now testify that it has helped them much and that a more effect-ual work will be performed in the future.At Los Angeles the Branch is in a good condition. Agoodspirit prevails. The Saints meet together in testimony meetings, &rejoice in the Gosplel. They expect to lead six or eight down intothe waters of Baptism dureing the coming week. They have been hold-ing outdoor meetings on the Streets when the weather would admit,and have good sized congregations and fairly good attention. Two ofthose about to be Baptized, a Lady and a Gentleman will be added toour numbers as a direct result of Street preaching: this is quit anincouragement to the Elders in that line of labor. A similar satate-ment may be made of the situation in San Diego only that the Bran-ch is not so strong. At Sacramento the Branch is about to receivean increase of several new members by Baptism, and a goodytly numbere of strangers are attending our meetings trhere, and the spirit of in-vestigation seems to nbe growing.The Elders who went out into new ground, as shown in my lastreport, have met with all the incouragement that was hoped for. Onereport from the southern part of the State says among other things, "If one wants to get well fed, travel without purse or scrip, Itel I tell you, they will nearly cram you to death". The report fromNapa County says, they get three meals a day and a good bed at nigh night; and are generally invited to retursn. From San Benito andMonteray Counties a similar voice is heard. I havejust returnedfrom Salinas in Monteray County, where we preached in a Hall and onthe streets last Sunday; a good feeling prevails towards the eldersand the prospects are good for a bright for a good work to be donethere.At San Jose the Elders have been laboring for some time with a nu number of investigators and they expect to Baptize 7 or 8 in the nnear furture. As soon as the weather woill admit I sahall go out thereand heplp the Eldesrs in their outdoor preaching and make things aslively as I can posable possible.Here in San Francicsco the work is steadily moving along; 
 bed; and they are spending their whole time among the people inst-ead of from three to five hours out of the twenty four. All areare rejoicing in the new move, and testify that the blessings thatthey daily receive in the opporations of the Holy Spirit are richand rare beyond anything they have ever expeariensed before.The Hall at San Jose has been discontinued; as I believe itstood in the way of a better mode-that of secureing meetings inprivate houses, and thereby giving us a better chance to reach thepeople. It has also cut off some expense.Many good earnest people are investigating the truths of thegospel, and as time rolls on we hope to gather them into the fold;and I fully expect the California Mission to become self-suportingin the near future.The whole Statelies before us, and all that is necessary to handle it, is a suf-ficient number of Elders. There is room for a pair of Elders inevery county, and in each large City in the State; and if itshould be the mind and will of the Lord to send us twice or threetimes the number of Elders that we now have, we can soon put thisMission in a prosperous condition. I have not a doubt that theycan travel in every part of the State, with-out purse or scrip:and be treated as gentlemen where ever they go. And now Dear Bro-ther, if you will kindly indulge me, I will say, that well educat-ed, bright, and inteligent young men, are the only ones that canhope to sucseed in theis mission.Out-door preachingis now being pushed with vigor by the Elders in San Diego; and asa consequence their hall every Sabath envening is filled to over-flowing. This mode of preaching the Gospel has been resorted to insome instances in this northern part of the State, and will becomegeneral as soon as the rainy season is past and the weather becom-es more pleasant. Our Hall here in San Francisco is well filled revery Sunday night and sometimes standing room is in demand.The News-papersthroughout the State are treating us with fair consideration. Inmany instances publishing a synopsis of our sermons, and also oth-er articals that we prepare for them, all of which is having a goodeffect, and paving the way for us, through-out the State.The Southern-Pacific CompanyMr J. C. Stubbs, 3 rd Vice President, and general Freight Agent ofthe Company invited me to an interview, for the purpose of talkingover the dificulties that existed between the Rail Road people ^hear^, &the Brethren at Salt Lake City, in relation to the transportationof the Elders over the Southern Pacific to and from San Francisco.The interview, however was interupted before it was concluded, byhis with-drawing from [illegible] the room, and we retired. I afterwardwrote him, stating our situation, the work we are doing, andthat which we expect to do; and that it was verry desirable that Ishould be able to travel all over the State, to look after the Elders 
 many strangers attend our meetings and we have all the investigator^s^at presant that we are able to attend to with our limited force ofElders. Four have been baptized since my last report, and a numberof others have announced themselves as about ready to come into thefold.I deeply appreciate the courtesies extended to me by the SouthernPacific Company which greatly facilitates my movements, and thusenables me to visit all the Elders in every part of the State andassist them in the prosecution of their missionary labors.A great field lies before us. The Harvest is indeed greta^t^and the laborers are few; and in the distribution of new missionar-ies we devoutly hope that 40 or 50 will fall to our portion. Wecan comfortably take care of that number dureing the coming spring.I earnestly congratulate you Dear Brother on your having livedto behold the ushering in of the 91st year of your life, and de-voutly hope that you may be spared as long as this life shall besweet unto you.Ever praying for your welfare I remain,Your Brother in the Gospel,E.

 and to embrace every opportunity to place more of them in theState; and in order that I might do this more effectually I desir-ed a free anual Pass over all their Roads in the State, as wellas a regular Half Fare Clergyman's Permit for any of the Elders wh at any time that I might desire to move them from place to place.In answer to this letter I received another yesterday from MrStubbs regretting the fact that the interview was interupted andinviting me to call on him again, next tuesday. I took the liber-ty to say to Mr Stubbs, that if I could report to the Presidencyat Salt Lake City, that the Southern Pacific Company, was treat-ing me and our Elders in this State with courtesy and considerat-ion, it would have the immediate effect of turning all the travelof our Elders to and from San Francisco, over their road.I fully expect to get my pass, and I need it very muchthat I may travil through-out the State, and encourage the Eldersin the good work of spreading the Gospel. I will let you know immed-iately, wheather I sucseed or not.I devoutly hope that the course I have persued willmeet your approbation, and any sugestions you have to offer, or anyinstructions that you may see fit to favor me hwith, I will do myutmost to carry them out, according to the Spirit and the ltetterthere-ofI here-with submit you our financial and Tithing report for the la[st]six weeks, trusting that it will meet your approvalAnd now with profound respectI remain your Brother in the Gospel E.

R. Shops. They are good faithfull Latter-day-Saints; theirhouse has been a home for the Elders for years. The Sister is a most most devout member of the Church. Her health is very poor; she desi^res^to make a trip to Salt Lake City, and work in the Temple, and afterwards return to Sacramento. As there is no Bishop here, to giveher a recomend, is there any way by which she can secure the need^-^ed Recomend to admit her to the Temple? The Branch at Sacramentois not fully organized; it has but a presiding Elder over it; andthere are the traveling Elders laboring there. If there is any waythat this Sister can be admited to the Temple to work for her deadand gain a blessing for her self, please instruct me. She is said toto be, by the local President and the traveling Elders, worthy of allacceptation. She lives in hopes of being healed, if she can be per-mited to go into the Temple.All is well in the Mission and our prospects are brightfor bringing many honest Souls into the fold.Praying that you may live long, Your Brother, E.

I have arranged for the presidents of Branches to receipt to Members for tithing & I receipt to the Presidents. This saves much of the labor incident to the other way & secures a record in each Branch of the individual status of each member by keeping a Record in each Branchof all that is paid by each member, which had not been done prior to my arrival. There is no record in the Mission that will show the standing of the members on the Tithing ques-tion prior to my arrival. But each Branch record now does this. If this is not sat-

 CALIFORNIA MISSION532 Castro St. San Francisco Cal.Jan. 30th, 1897.President Wilford WoodruffSalt Lake City, Utah.Dear Brother:I greatly fear that my letter of the 8th to you, has con-veyed a wrong impression in relation to my arrangement with theSouthern Pacific Company. Such at least, Brother Reynolds letter ofthe 12th seems to indicate. I was aware before I came here thatsome trouble had existed between the Company and the Brethren atSalt Lake City about the transportation of our Elders over theirRoad. When I was introduced by President Shurtliff to Mr J. C. Stubbs he refered to that difficulty and invited me to an interviewfor the purpose of talking it over; and if possable bring abouta better understanding on the subject. When I went to that interviwewI asked no favors; I promised nothing. I went with the determinat-ion to secure the best conditions possable for all our Elders mov-ing from place to place throughout the State or traveling to andfrom Ogden. I stated that all we asked for all our Elders was the s same priveileges freely accorded to all other ministers of all ot-her donominations—the Clergymans half-fare-permit. But in relationto my self, having been appointed President of this Mission it wasnecessary that I should travel all over the State, and to facilitat^e^my movements and enable me tovisitevery town and city through^ou^t theState and thus open up new fields to preach the Gospel and by sodoing be enabled to place many more of our Elders in the Missionaryservice, a free annual pass would be of great benifit to the workin which I was engaged, and would result in greatly increased tra-vel of our Elders over their Road. That all these Elders had tocome from Utah ^,I said^ "they can come over your raoad from Ogden, theycan go the other way, I have got a man to send home to morrow mor-ning, I can send him the other way" Mr Stubbs and Mr Donalson wh^o^was with him then refered to the unpleasantness that occured sometime ago, evidently with some feeling, and appearantly with deepregret; stating that such occurances must be avoided in the fut-ure: that they would issue the half-fare-permits to such as were eentitled to them who applied directly through me; this they requir-ed for their protection and to this I agreed. I had suggested thatif they treated me and my fellow laborers with consideration andcourtesy it would have the effect of removing the unpleasantnessesof the past and would doubtless secure the good will of the Pre-sidency at S. L. C. Mr Stubbs then said he would recomend to his c committee that the pass be issued for six months. It was expresslyunderstood, that all Elders, wheather they were returning homefrom this, or from any of the Iland Missions, desiring to obtainthe half-fare-permit, must apply for it through me; this was theonly condition made. I said nothing that could in any way bind the

 See overCALIFORNIA MISSION612 Van Ness Ave. San Francisco, Cal.Jan. 8th, 1897President Wilford WoodruffSaltLake City, Utah.Dear Brother:I take great pleasure in reporting the fact to you, that I have just completed arrangments with the Southern Pacific Company by which they have issued to me a —:Free aannual Pass:—and ^will call^ to all our Elders throughuout the State and to and from Ogden a Clergy-man^'s^half-fare-permit; under the following conditions. That in all^ ^cases either for Elders laboring in this mission directly under my control^,^or Elders reteurning from any of the Ilands Missions who desire to avail themselves of this privelege s theyshall make application to the Company directyly through me; and for whom-so-ever I ask this favor, they will grant it. After a long interview with Mr. J. C.Stubbs 3rd Vice-President, on the 5th, and another with Mr. Donald-son his assistant, to day, this is the result. They requir the conditions above refered to as a protection to them against any of our people who might under-take to secure th^e^se privelegeds without being justly entitled to them. They hope, in consideration of the favors thus extended by them to us, especially the free annuall pass to me over all their roads in the State, that the good will of the Presidency at Salt Lake City will be secured and tha t all the Elders traveling to and from the Ilands as well as such as come to this mission will patronize their Road from Ogden to San Francisco.I hope Dear Brother, that what I have done in this matter will meet your Iapprobationorrow for Los Angeles your approbation.I start to morrow for Los Angeles to visit the Elders in the Southern part of the State. I expect to be gone two or three ^weeks,^if you have any word for me, kindly send it to this place and it will be forwarded to me.All the Elders but five in this mission are now traveling with out purse or scrip and the finest reports continue to come in from them. tThey declare they are are treated royally on allmost every hand. Spending their whole time among the people and making many friends. All the Elders are full of praise and thanksgiving to the almighty for the change that has been made and are looking for rich returns in the future as a result of the presant mode of laboring among the people.Four of the presant force of Elders in the mission will have been here two years in the Spring. We shall need others to filtheir place^s^; beside this, there are 56 Counties in the State;there is room for a pair of Elders in every County. I am fully per-suaded sway^ua^ded that the elders can travil in every part of the SttState without purse or scrip and be treated as Gentlemen. I am redready to use any number of elders that you may  see fit to send me.Devoutly praying for blessings upon you all, your Brother E.H.Nye 
 Presidency or any of the Brethren to travel this way, when it was desirable to go the other, or at all, only so far as to state, that the good will of the Presidency  and the Brethren generally could be secured by kind treatment on the part of the company of our El-ders in this Mission. I did not consider that I had any authorityto make any promises that could hamper or bind the Presidency, and,made none. I deeply regret that my letter was so worded as to con-vey the impression that I had exceeded the bounds of proprietyand I sincerely trust that this statement of the situation will be satisfactory. I candidly confess that I was highly elated at mysucsess in securing my pass all over the State for one year (it is a regular annual pass) and a pleasant arrangement with the company by which I could move the Elders all over the state with out any friction with the company, on the half-fare-permit: in fact, all the benifits are ours, while we are under no obligations.The tracts refered to we obtained from President E. S. Kimball of the Southern States Mission and have paid the cash for them. President Tanner Gave me no information in relation to obtaining Tracts; ha^e^nce I was wholly ignorent upon that point and vvery thankful to know that you can supply us; can you also supply us with the Voice of Warning? we now get them from the South post paid at 12/2 cents; we are very much in need of a good supply of them.We now have 28 elders and three Sisters in the Misssion. 8 of the Brethren and the Sisters, are according to the gen-eral rules entitled to a release in the near future, the Brethren having been in the Mission from 19 to 22 22 months. This Mission here-to-fore has been a heavy expense to the Elders and some of them feel that it is a hardship to hold them here much longer; es-pecially in view of the fact that from some source they have been led to believe that this Mission would release them in 18 months because of its having been so expensive.If it is designed to push matters forward in this Missin I can proffitably use 40 or 50 new Elders in the next three months and still more as the time wears on. Will you kindly let me know wawhat I may look for in relation to this matter.In San Diego there is a Negro who desires to be Baptisedhe is a Minister, a whole-souled fellow; will you please instruct e me what to do in relation to him.Our prospects are very bright, the most encouraging repot^rts^ continue to come in from all parts where the elders are laboring.I released Elder A.

We are perfectly satisfied with his explanation about Rail Road matters and we are glad he has succeeded so well.

 CALIFONIA MISSION508 Fulton St. San Francisco, Calif. April 9th, 1897.President Wilford Woodruff,Salt Lake City, Utah.Dear Brother;I here with enslose you a financial report of the^i^sMission for last month. After carefull consideration we find thatit is cheaper to rent unfurnished Rooms and provide our own Fur-niture than to rent furnished rRooms: Hence we have bought some Fur-niture and in so doing, we have had to borrow from some of theElders, who are now in need of their money. The Tithing last monthfell considerably short of what it was the two months previous, butwe feel sure that it will come up again much better as the time rooll^s^on; especially as a goodly number of good a desirable class of people have recently been baptized. If you will kindly help us outto the amount of our deficiency so that we can pay the Brethrenwhat we owe them, it will relieve us of our embarrassment and willI assure you be deeply appreciated.Our Northern Conferance will convene in this City, SundayMorning April 11th, and our Southern Conferance in San Diego April25th after which I will send you a full report of our condition.Ever praying the choicest blessings of heaven upon youI remain, Very truly your Brother,E.

 Haifa Palestine Sept 16th 1892The First Presidency Salt Lake CityMy dear Brethern!Your highly appreciated letter of July 29th came to hand just as I was leaveing Constantinople. You will understand from this that I dident leave when I first expected to, but was, for several reasons, delayed. The principle reason of my delay was the fact the tracts I had ordered inVienna did not turn out as I had expectedthey would. Shortly after my writing my last letter,I was informed, through Mr Baichel, the agent through whom I had ordered, that the tracts had been confiscated before leaveing the Vienna house. "The manuscript" said B "Has been savedand sent to Leipzig whare the tracts will be re-printed without any extra cost to you." A day or so after bringing this intellegence, Mr. B. called again this time to say he had been sus-pected as being the one who sent the orders to the Vienna house and, as a consiquence had been summoned to appear before an investigating board of Turkish Officials, whare, to shield himself and me, he denied all knowledge of the same, whare upon, th board telegraphed to 
 have the Vienna firm arrested and made to dis-close who sent in the order. The firm were placed under arrest and bonds were fixed at 12 pounds. They were given two days to answer in. The Vienna people wired B to learn if he wouldforfeit the 12 pounds or have his name revealed."And now" Said B "I have come to find out if your will pay the forfeiture." As I was tired of paying out money on those tracts I told him no I certainly would not pay a nother cent on them. He said "Mr Musser if you dont pay that fine I will send in your name as being the one who gave me the manuscript" "I will get off all right"said he "but you will have four or five years to stay in Turkey" I told him I had no objections to his dooing just as he felt was right all that I would insist upon was his furnishing me the tracts I had paid for, and on his return-ing to me 6 pounds I had loned him while he was in distress and for I held his note. At this he became very boisterous and left threatening to telegraph my name right off to ViennaI hardely knew what to do. I thought it was possible he could get me in to trouble stillI felt sure he was acting dishonestly and that it would be a sin to meet his demands 
 Jaffa April 2and 1893First Presidency Salt Lake City U.S.A.Dear Brethern:I am in receipt of your favor of Feb. 14th. with enclosed Imperial Ottoman Bank draft No. 2887 for 500.00, Five hundred, francs.  In your above refered to letter you ask me to send you a few copies of the tracts I have had prin-ted.  Oon the 15th of last September I addressed a communication to you, in which I explained how it was I was unsuc-cesful in obtaining the tracts I had ordered, and paid for, at Austria. Since then I have heard nothing of them.  Through the kindness of a Mr Heilpern I have a letter of introduction to a publishing house in Jerusalem whare, I am assured by Mr. Heilpern, I will be able to get our tracts printed without dif-ficulty and at the usual charges.As soon as practicable I will go to Jerusalem and see what I can do.I am pleased to hear we are to have a nother missionary in this part of the field, and that there are steps being taken at home in the way of educateing elders for this 
 Haifa July 24th. 1893First PresidencySalt Lake CityUtah.Dear Brethern:I have at last succeeded in get-ting some of our tracts printed in the arabic language a few coppies of which I herein enclose They were printed at Jerusalem by a Jew at a cost of 100.00 frs per 2000.The Christians of Jerusalemwould not permit themunder any considerationthough I gave them all a chance. It was through the kindness of Mr. Jos. Schore a Jewish proselyte and manager of the Church of 
 England press at the "Holy City" that I was successful in getting the Jew to permit them.Bro Huish has been here for some time and we have decided that he should return with Bro Herman, who has also been here for a week or so, to the north and labor in and a bout Aintab.  I think we need a German speaking Elder in this part of the vineyard just as soon as ^is^ possibleto get one Bro Herman re-ports very good success from in Aleppo and Aintab.  A number have recently embraced the truth and the saints are enjoying 
 for more money. I wrote President Young for instructions and decided in the mean time to let matters run there course. Prest Young ad-vised me to go Haifa but at this time Haifa was quarantined on account of cholera hence I had to remain in Constantinople four or five weeks longer. In the meantime Bro Haag arrived fromSchwitzerland. Bro Herman had taken his depart-ure for Aintab some time before this. I had tried several times to see Mr Baichel but was unsuccessful untill one day I ran across him on the street. He surprised me by saying he had fixed everything "OK" in regards the tracts and that they would be here in the course of a week or ten days. Two weeks after this I was informed by the steam ship company that the quarantine at Haifa had been raised I had not yet received the tracts and could get no trace of Baichelso I decided I had been defrauded and ratherthen waste any more time I would take Bro Haag and go into Palestine. The morning we left B. called on us to ask what he should do with the tracts when th came, as he was expecting them everyday I told him when they came hecould forward them to my address in PalestineThis he promised to do. It is now over four weeks 
 Mount Carml Hospitalnear Haifa, ^Turkey^ Oct 4th 1892The First Presidency Salt Lake City My dear Brethern!Refering to the desmise of our beloved Brother & fellow worker in the cause of truth, Adolf Haag, I will say he died of typhus yeasterday morning at five minutes past four.On the 16th of September, the day after I addressed you my last letter, Bro Haag was a gain taken ill and, not withstanding every thing, that human love and skill could suggest for his good, being done, he gradualy sank lower & lower untill the Angle of rest was sent to loosen the bands holding him to this earth of sorrow & pain, and bid his soul "Assend on high and be rewardedfor the labors you have so willingly, and faith-fuly preformed." I was with him from th time he was taken sick untill his spirit was waftedabove, and not once did I hear him complain I did not, I could not think he was so seriously ill.Not even when he got so weak I had to feed him and lift him from one bed to the other, did I realize Iwould soon have to part with my energetic & noble companion. And even now, after seeing 
 mission.I will send part of the 500.00 frs. to Elder Herman who, by the by, is well and reports some success in Aintab and there a bouts.With many thanks for your consideration,I remainYour Brother Don C. W. MusserJust so.J. F. S.[sideways text]D. C. W. MusserApr. 2nd 1893.[End of sidways text] 
 the blessings of the Gosp^e^leBefore Bro Gran left Haifa he gave me an order on a gentleman that has charge of his property here with which I can draw what money I need.On this account I have paid Bro Herman up to date 457.99 francs. Of course this amount I will have to report to Bro Gran who is now on his way to Utah and he will be very apt to visit you with this report and you will under stand from this, what it is.I realize I have no au-thority to pay the expenses of traveling elders inthis mission. But as 
 since then and I have heard nothing of the tracts or Mr Baichel.I was told by all the steam ship agents that the cheapest way I would possibly get to Haifa was via Alexandria and Port Said. I purchased tickets to Alexandria. Upon our arrival here we were told we would have to wait five days before we could get a ship for Palestine. We therefore decided to go by way of Cairo and see the Pyramids thence direct up the celebrated Sues Canal to Port Said. Arriving at Port Said in we had three more days to wait dooring which time I was very sick. On Saturday the ship arrived at Port Said and just at the last minutethe agent at this place received a telegram say-ing the quarantine had not yet been raised at Haifa and cansiquently not to sell tickets for this station. So the nearest we could get to our destination was Jappa, two days journey with horses. I fear my letter is getting rather long so I will close. I will add however that our ride from Jappa to Haifa cost us 100.00 frs. Bro Haags health is not good I have written particulars to Prest Youngand I think Bro Haag will be removed from this to the German mission. In which case we would need another German speaking Elder here. I am very pleased with the outlook here in this part of 
 [sideways text]D. C. W. MusserJan. 7 [18]93.[end of sideways text]Jerusalem January 7th 1893First PresidencySalt Lake CityUtah U. S. A.My dear Brethern:You, doubtless, would like to hear something from the "Turkish Mission."  I am sorry to have kept you waiting so long, but the fact of the matter is, I have had nothing of importance to communicate, and, therefore, thought it best not to write.  Shortly after my companion's death I had the pleasure of baptiseing two souls,sisters, at Haifa. I then came to Jaffa whare I baptised a nother sister, a blind lady.  These are all germen people.  I havent, as yet, adminis-tered baptisn to any of the native Aribs, though I have had one or two applicants.  After Bro Haag's dismiss I thought I had better stay in this part of the country as our saints here have been left a long time with out an elder.  Preveious to this I had been studying the turkish language.But as that is not spoken here, Arabic being the tongue, I droped the former and took up the latter study, which I find extremely difficult.Unlike other languages, one must first learnthe grammer before he can read correctly.  My desire was, and still is, to master this languagethat I might become proficient to teach others it.With this in view I employed a teacher, but after a short time, on account of my finances, I was forced to dispense with him.  Since then my progress has been slow.Since comeing here I have made a 
 his thin pleasant face fixed in death, after our long ride to the cemetery listening to the doleful music of the villi^a^ge bell made to toll as a mark of respect for the man of God, who had left all behind to fallow Jesus. After beholding the body of clay being returned to mother earth, and seeing the flowers that were so loveingly prepaired to strew on his grave, it is hard for me to realize that he is gone and I am a lone.Bro Haag, though here but a short time, had made a host of friends as evidenced by the large concourseof people, all anxious to share ^there^ sympathies by coming to the funerall. Amomg whom I saw the German Consulate & his wife, who by th by have been very kind to us, the Mayer of Haifa who entertamed us all oneafternoon listening to our testimonies and, in fact, nearly every one in the colony was in attendanceYou will see by the heading of this letter that I am in the hospital. This is a house built ontop of Mount Carml whare people came to get the benifits of the fresh mountain air. By order of the Doctor, I brought Bro Haag here but it didentseem to be just the thing for him so last Friday theDr had us move him back to the colony whare he couldget to see him oftener, and where he afterwards hidin Bro Gran's house. After the funeral the Doctorsaid it would be absolutely necessary for me 
 long as the Elders stand in need and ask for help and I have some way of getting money I am a fraid I will have to render assistence.Hopeing that my actions in this respect will be approvedI remainyour Brother in truth Don C. W. MusserP.S. I would add that the enclosed tracts are not printed by permission of the Turkish Government D. C. W. M.J. F. S.[upside-down text]Don C. W.

 the mission. We have three, and perhaps more,babtisems to preform in the near future.I should have written at an earlier date but was waiting something definite to write a bout.  I am extremely sorry a bout those tracts as we needthem very much. We have so much liberty otherwise in this country.Ever praying for the blessings of the Lord to be with you.I remain Your Brother Don. C. W. MusserP.S. I will have to ask you to please wait untill I return to Constantinople for a Financial report of this mission as I left the books there.

 prayful study of the condition ant out look of this mission, which is not yet opened up.A few Aribs in this country, i.e. three, have been bap-tised.  One of them, a sister, died in the church the other two, brethern, are still in Jaffa and as unfameliar with the requirements and bless-ings of the Gospel as it was possible for them to be before they were baptised.  They bothclaim they were were promiced means to eme-grate with on con ditions that they would be baptised.  This seems to have been there only ob-ject.  One of them is very dishonest and an an ideler from the word go.  He has said a great many meen things about our church, and lately avoids me, almost as much, if not quite, as he would a serpent.  When I do get a chance to talk with him, which is not often, I cant make him understand, though he speaks a little english.  I will have to wait untill I cantalk his language before I can do any thing with him.There is an enormous work to be done here, and I feel confident that now is the time to be dooing it.  But how to make an opening, seems to me to be the all important question.  Might I offer a suggestion I would say send out more missionaries, say six for palestine, with instructions to proceed to Jaffa, there employ a teacher and devote your whole time to the study Arabic.  Our elders could master the lang uage enough, in one year, to enable to preach and con-verse.  At the end of the first year send out six 
 to return to the mountain unless I wanted to get sick, and, as I felt that this was the case,I decided to com right up. I shall stay here a week or so to rest and recruit up.I have just finished letters to Prest Young and to Bro Richard Haag of Salt Lake and as I know of nothing more of importance to communicate at present I will bring my brief to a closePraying the Lord to bless you I remain your Brother in the covenant of truthDon C. W. MusserI will add that Bro Herman is well and reports everything in good condition at AintabD. C. W. M.

 more elders with the same instructionsOne of the first six would be able to teach those who arrived last thereby cutting off one ex-pense.  After a person learns the language he can live here as cheap as any other part of the world.  And after the mission began to be opened up it would be more self surportingThe various missionaries in Palestine are meeting with but poorl success.  They buy what converts they get and pay high prices for them.  The Catholics & Greeks haveing the most money get the most converts.  Of course when the pure Gospel of Christ, with its blessings and gifts is introduced by humble and authorized servants there will be a great many of the honest brought to light.  A great many of those who are anxious to serve the Lord for I beleave they are here.  If the above course was persued, I think in three years time the turkish missionwould be self surporting.  But if things are leftas they are at present, with one elder in this whole reagion, and be unfameliar with the language. I beleave the turkish mission will remain undeveloped.  I trust you will please pardon these few suggestions.Now I wish to say a few words regarding my labor which, at times, seems almost to be in vain.  My progress is slow and the opposition I encounter would be discourage-ing did I not know I am engaged in the Lord's cause.  My expences have been very high and are high at the present writing, but it seems I cant better matters in this respect. 
 D. C. W. MusserOct. 4 [18]92. 
 On the 30th of November I wrote to Prest Young setting forth my desire to travel with out Purse & Scrip.I said, among other things, that if he thought it wisdom, I would send him what money I had.  I havent received a reply from Prest young but I have learned I cant travel with out money.  I dont doubt the Lord for I know I am the recepient of rich blessings from Him every hour in the day, and were it not for His spirit I enjoy, I could not stay here.  As Isaid in one of my previous letters, I love to tell people we mormon elders travel on our own means, We pay all of our expenses from our own pockets. We do not "preach for money and devine for hire."  But my means have long since been exhausted and I have no way of obtaining more.  I am perfectly willing to give my note for every cent of Church money I use,while engaged in this work.  And I hopethat on this condition you will kindly advance me more money.Bro Herman is laboring with the Turksand Armenians at Aintab & there a bouts.  He reports everything "OK" though he needs a companion the worst kind.  It is not necessary for missionaries, laboring in that part of the field,to understand German.Hopeing to here from you soon, and begging your pardon for this lengthy letter, and praying the Lord to bless you I remainYour Brother in the GospelDon.

Feb'ry. 9th, 1876.My dear Brother:Your very welcome favor of the 20th instult.came duly to hand. I was very glad to receive it. I havewritten very fully to the President, and I thought it like-ly that you would hear them ^letters^ read. It is scarcely clear yet as to what Congress will do in our case.The bill before the House is to give us a newelection law. This is a "Ring" Bill and iswas broughtor sent down by my contestant. I do not want to see it or any other Bill ^of theirs^ become law. We are capable of governing ourselves. The result to be gained bythe passage of these Bills is not concealed. The "ring"say to Congress, "give us the legislation we want andwe will control Utah and settle the Mormon questionwhich vexes the nation." In other words, "Bind the Mor-mon people hand and foot, give us control of them andwe will dispose of them." If the Lord is willing that this shall be done, Congress, no doubt, will enact the necessary 
 legislation. But I have not yet received any intimationthat the Lord is willing to sSuffer any such evils to fallupon us.I have watched your proceedings in the As-sembly with great interest. You have had, appa-rently, a quiet time. If there be any conflict, I suppose we shall hear of it toward the close of the Session. I trust that your labors will be of benefit to the Territory and satisfactory to yourselves.The war against us will go on, I expect, until we are vic-torious. But I do earnestly desire and yearn for the time to come when we shall enjoy our full rights as citizens under the Constitution; when we shall be freefrom the yoke that our enemies seek to fasten us. TheLord has made it light to us, or it would be unbearable.Now for 28 years we have been in the Mountains, and we have shown our capacity for self-government and we should have the privilege of electing our own officers. Ibelieve the day is not far distant when we shall have greaterliberty than we have at present. Enclosed please find a letterfor Bro. Erastus Snow, which oblige me by handing to him if in the city;if he has left, please send to him. I send it open that you may read some items that may be of interest to you. With love to yourself and our mutualfriends and kind regards to your family, I am Your Brother, Geo. Q. Cannon

These have a President with his counselors,Elders, Priest Teachers and Deacons. Ladies relief and Mutuel Impr-vement Associations, and Sabbath Schools. Sacramento has a Branch wiwith a Presiding Elder, but is without helps as there are not suitable men to fill the offices at presant, but we hope to be able to com-pleate the organization as the time rolls on; it has a good ladies relief association and a good little Sabbath school. San diego has a goodly number of Saints but is as yet unorhganized; though they hahave a good sabbath school. There is also a Sabbath Sachool at Lat-trobe in Eldorado county, composed ocf children of non membes presided over by one of our local elders and hassisted by his wifeTheir tsutuddies are entirely from our works obtained from Geo.Q. Cannon & Sons Company.During the year we have led into the waters of Baptism onehundred and forty nine; these have been principally in the cities of San Francisco, Sacramento, Los Angeles and San Diego; with a few in SSan Jose and Oakland.The Elders are now traveling without purse or scrip in 20 counties; 13 of which have been opened up during the last year, and while we are used well in most instances in all the localities refered to yet aso far, but few baptisms have been recorded in any of these counties; still there are many friends rising up on every hand, and a warm welcome extended to the Elders in many places.The Josephites are our most active opponants. Two of the El-ders were recently 'Trap'd' by them. They were overtaken one day by a carriage with two occupants and asked to ride; and on learning who they were an invitation was given to attend a meeting at which it wawas thought they would be able to speak to the people. On reaching ththe meeting house and the one who invited them began to speak they discovered that he was the gGreat 'Elder Daily' of the 'Reorganized'church, and our bitterest enemy. His whole speach consisted of a string of horrors, laid at the door of the Mormons. At the clost ofwwhich, Elder knight reached and took him by the hand and shook himheartily and while doing so, turned to the audience and repeted the wordsof the Saviour, Mat.5.44. At the close of the meeting many of the audience came tand shook the boys heartily and asked them to their houses while Mr. Daily looked and acted as though he had made a mistake.The News Papers have been fair in their treatment towarxds us throug^ou^t the state in most instances; notably the 'Call' and 'Post' of this city and the 'Fresno Republican' and several others in the 
 CALIFORNIA MISSION.915 GOLDEN Gate Ave. San Francisco, Calif.June 1st, D 1898.President Wilford Woodruff, Salt Lake City, Utah.Daer Brother;On my return from the general conferance at Salt Lake City, weheld our conferance in this city; April 17th and 18th. Quite a numbercame from Oakland San Jose and Sacramento, and the meetings were well aattended during both ^days^ of our conferance. The spirit of the Lord rested upon the Elders, the Saints were instructed and the strangers haeard thethe Gospel.After our Priesthood meeting, and the buisness affairs of the con-ferance where adjusted I went to Los Angeles and there we held anothertwo day's conferance, April 24, & 25 which was another Grand sucsess.I then visited San Diego and there we organized a branch, a Ladies re-lief society and a primary association. There are about 60 members in the branch which would have been organized some time ago but for the llack of suitable material of which to form a presidency. It is now in good condition and ^has^ bright prospects before it.The Los Angeles branch is becoming thrifty and strong; at this lanst monthly Priesthood meeting there was 19 members of the local PtPriesthood president. They have a fine ladies Relief society, a mutual-Improvment association, that has a weekoly attendance of 60 or 70 per-sons, many of whom are investigators.  They have a good sunday Schooland on the occasion of my last visit they had 29 little children and larger boys and girls and Teachersa, about 50 all told. We cannot speakso waell of San Francisco the middle and northern parts of the state as of the southern portion. Why we do not know. The Elders are work-ing hard and faithfully but an indifferance seems to exist and as a consequence progress is slow. Some of the counties in the great wheat producing parts of the state we have had to adbandon for the presant on account of the terrible drouth that prevails all through that portion of the state as so many of the people have had to leave for other parts in order to make a living for the season. Of course it is tthe working classaes as a rule that are our best friends, and they a^are^ the ones that have had to seek employment else where.On my return from the southern part of the mission I went to San Jose and had an interview with Brother Keller the author 
 CALIFORNIA MISSION508 Fulton St. Saln Francisco, Calif.May, 10th, 1897.President Wilford Woodruff, Salt Lake City, Utah.Dear Brother:I take great pleasure in reporting to you the presant condit-ion of thids Mission. Since my last report I have visited many partsof the State and labored with the Elders in their several fields.We held Conferance in San Francisco on the 11th of April and onthe 25th in San Diego. Reports from all the Elders make clear thefact, that traveling in the Lords appointed waly-without purse orscrip-is by far the most desirable; by it the Elders have access topeople they could reach in no other way and they are being treatdwell. They find no difficulty in reaching the people. Occasionallythey meet a 'Crank' or a 'Sore-head' barely enough to give var-iety to missionary life.The wokrk at Los Angeles has grown rapidly since my lastreport. About 18 or 20 have been Baptized. On the 21st of April wehad the pleasure of organizeing the Branch there; prior to that timthere had been but a presiding Elder there, but they now rejoicein a Branch with a President and his councilors and members ofthe lesser priesthood all in good working order. On the 7th of Maywe organized the Ladies Relief association, and the Mutual Improve-men association on the same evening; and as there is a good sunday-school there, Los Angeles can now be said to be in a good, prosperouscondition. The Branch has 57 dgood active members and a bright pros-pect for a number being added in the near future.I have been out with the Elders in several parts fothe mission, shareing with them the joys and fatigues ovf the missioary work; waklking and visiting by day and Preaching to good congre-gations at night; and seeing for myself the way in which our Eldersare received and treated by the people; and it seems to me that awonderfull future lies before us and the only thing necessary to bedone, to bring hosts of good people into the fold, is, aided by thespirit of the Lord, to work, work, work.We now have a continuous line of Elders from San Franciscoto San Diego in the Coast Counties; and as the time rolls on, hopeto gather the fruits of our labors in the form of many souls broughtinto the fold.In the southern part of the State the Josephites, in Ograngecounty, haveing invited us to speak in their meeting-house, desiredthat I should ^speak^ on the "Sucsession of the Presidency", at the closethe District President arose and said that he wanted all his localauthorities to give us therir meeting-houses in which to preach and come out in force to hear us; that they wanted all the light therewas to be had on the matter. A most cordial invitation was extendedto us to preach in their meeting-house at any time:.
