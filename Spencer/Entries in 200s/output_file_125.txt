But I told the people the day would come  when the world would be flooded with Revelation, but from the devil. This began by a woman being put to sleep &amp; gave Revelation. Spiritualism began in this way all their Revel- ations go to deny Jesus Christ, the gospel &amp; the Atonement There are a few thousands who do know that God lives I  with this people know it &amp; are witnesses of it, &amp; there never was a people as much blessed as this people on Earth We have the privilege of Attending to the ordinances of the House of God for the dead, did the Zion of Abram  Twelve Apostles in the days of Christ No they did not. But we are the people that are called to do this work. What other people have been called to do this  work I do not know of any, if this is our work what state  of Mind are we in, are we after the world &amp; the things of the world this should not be. those who have turned away from  their callings &amp; seek for the things of the world will turn away from the Church &amp; Apostitize. The world are com- bined against &amp; seek our destruction. they do not see the  things of God, but we do, this is the difference between them and  us. We know the things of God, but they do not, it is our duty  to gather the poor &amp; build up Zion, while they seek to destroy  us. God will save all the Inhabitants of the Earth in some kingdom except the Sons of perdition. We are called to do that that No other people were Ever called to do. We are called to  keep the Mount Zion All  the Merchants who have got riches among us I cannot controll  them, &amp; if they do not repent they will be damned &amp; go to Hell. Can you not see your position that you are called to Redeem the dead. In the days of Joseph He felt vary  Bad to see a Man Apostitize But now I feel if a man   ENDENTRY June 22nd 1870    &amp; the least we say about the Apostates or the officers of Government  the Better, &amp; Mr Grant has been on a bed of Nettles to know what the Mormons were agoing to do if they  Passed the Collum Bill. I have told them I did not know but God will tell us what to do &amp; if we do it He will protect us in all things. We have No time to spare Not a Moment do all in our power to save ourselves &amp; redeem our dead. you may think things are going  slow but we are doing all we can. Now be kind to  your families dont scold at them But pray in your families &amp; do your duty to them. D H Wells spok 51 Minutes W Woodruff spoke 17 Minutes &amp; said we did not realize our  Privileges, if none of the Ancients Redeemed the dead we still  have a greater work to do. I would not like to go into the  spirit world &amp; meet my friends who have died without the gospel &amp; have them reproach me for not doing my duty towards them it is a great reponsibility to be a Prophet, Apostle or  Elder. the saints should take the council given them, the Ancients are not Perfect without us nor we without them then let us labor diligently to fulfill our mission &amp; do our  duty &amp; not sell our Birthright or make ship wreck of faith.

Those who follow Brigham Young will be  much richer than those who do not we should feel that all we  have is on the Altar to build up the Kingdom of God with. there is Nothing more glorious than to see an old man who has grown Gray in the service of God, &amp; in building up his work as we grow older we should grow better &amp; more kind to our fam- ily. President Young says Politeness is in the heart &amp; not in Bowing &amp; scraping. When Moses came out the people came out to see  him &amp; did not come out with Banners &amp; flags flying to greet him as they do President Young. When we were called to go  South we united as the Heart of one Man &amp; were ready to  Burn up Evry thing we had, the Lord tryed us in this But when He found we would do as we were told he with- held our hand from burning up our property &amp; restored it to us again in this I acknowlede the Hand of God in all things I was drowned in the Pacific &amp; it cured me of a Head  ake I had from my childhood.
