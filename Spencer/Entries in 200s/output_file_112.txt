 September 19, 1836 ~ MondaySept 19th Is a day long to be remembered by me & others in Consequence of the interesting scenes transpired with the Saints of God in the South. Isaiah & others of the Ancient Prophets testify to us of the great events of the last days esspecially of the literalgathering of Israel. They say the Saints shall gather from the East & from the West & that the North shall give up and the South keep not back. This interesting day had now arived yea the 19th of Sept 1836 when Some of the Saints of God in the South began to take their families their Charriots Waggons, their Oxen, their Horses their Tents their Armour and moove towards Zion as the children of Israel according to the command of God As followsed Arose in the morning at Br Camps & breakfas'ed at his house after which we reparded to the Bank of a stream whare Prayers were offered up unto God when President Marsh led a young man into the waters of Baptism & he was confirmed upon the bank of the stream under the hands of Presidents Marsh, Patten, & Grooves then we all stood upon our feet &receieved great Blessings confirmed upon our heads with uplifted hands of the three above named Brethren President Marsh being speaker We then all took the parting hand with these Beloved servents of God & with Sister Patten also these four friends took their seat in a waggon & set their faces as a flint towards Zion not waiting for those that on the same day ware to follow their example but with Ox teams Soon after the above named Brethren left us Br Albert Petty came to us from Cyprus Branch with his waggon & familyto join those of the Taropen Branch who ware going to Zion After spending a short time in aranging the waggons & teems the company were Prepared to move forward the company consisted of four ^4^ families with three Elders as follows

I immediately set before her the danger of returning to Babylon and encouraged her and she became reconciled and continued her journey.} I rode with them this first Days travel as far as the South fork of Mayfield whare we all camped for the night after pitching our tents & taking supper I assembled this small Camp of Israel together at Br Albert Petty's tent to address them for the last time & after they were assembled I arose to address them & although the rain desended in torrents so that we were wet through a good tent yet my soul was vibrated & fired with emotions & feeling of no ordinary nature I endeavord to lay before them the worth and value of the cause they were ingaged in & that they were the first in fullfiling the Prophets who spake of the South's giving up ^or keeping not back^ & that it would be recorded upon theArchives of heaven to be read in the day of eternity that they were the first fruits of the South who had spread their tents for Zion. I also instructed them about travling by the way they all covenanted to give heed to Elder Boydstuns Preceps as they had chosen him as their leader. When I closed I was followed By Elders Boydstun, Cathcart, & Clapp who spake in the spirit of God & with feeling of the deepest interest When this edifying interview closed by our kneeling & I addressed a throne of grace & imploredthe mercy of God to rest upon the camp that they might all reach Zion in Peace {distance} 8 miles

Mr Palmer being a decided Deist his object in this workwas to overthrow the vailidty & testimony of the scriptures or Prophet & Apostles And after ende-avouing to take the advantage by gathering together in one combined mass all the inconsistences, folies,& eviles af a sectarian generation & heaping them upon the true Church of Christ When ther is nomore concord or connection between the two now than between the Pharasees, SauseesHerodians, & Christ & the Apostles eighteen hundred years ago. He then says that the testimonyof Christ has failed & not fulfilled according to his word & for proof of his assertion hevoted the 24th Chapter of Math & says that in that Chapter Christ prophesied that the fall ofJerusalem The Comeing of Christ & the end of the world Would take place in the generation & he declares it did not take place & in consequence of this Mr Palmer makes the seceepingconclusion that the Bible is fals & Jesus Christ an imposter But let Mr Palmer holduntill that the Prophesy is fulfilled according to the declaration of Jesus Christ & all will be well& the world will feel the power of natuers God See Page 100 [FIGURE] Preached at ColRowletts at candle light I followed Elder SmootNovember 6, 1836 ~ Sunday6th Sunday Rode to William Smoot's Preached at his house distance of the day 7 milesNovember 7, 1836 ~ Monday7th Sold one Book of Mormon's & Rode to Owenton, Owen County, KY on the day of the election to vote for President &c at first they endeavor'd to Deprive Elder Smoot & myself from voting because we were strangers but after employing some Judges &Col J.

O time how swift & how precious thou art. How great the events that are bourn upon thy wings, esspecially in the dispensation of the fullness of times. 1836 is gone it cannot be recalled. Europe hath began to tremble at thy departure. The endowment of the Latter Day Saints hath bespake a God in Israel & is sufficient to show that though the heavens & the earth Pass away the word of God spake through the Prophets must all be fulfilled. It is true that the thought of man may now retrace his footsteps through 1836 that is Past. But who can tell whare the end of 1837 will leave him. Yea that important year that is mounting the wheels of time to stand upon the stage of exhistance to do its Perfect work. Will not its gigantic operations, & its magna works stand upon the Archieves of heaven as great events. Will this gentile generation still sleep in this late hour if so sleep on & take thy rest which is short for thy end is come & the day is broke that Israel must be awoke from his slumber for the last time & Prepare himself for the Bridegroom then let 1837 finish its work with speed & let its departure say who is gone to the tomb. & what Kingdom overturned & what Kingdom esstablished. Yea let 1837 Report (as it departs) that Zion with her stakes indicates tha God will rule in her midst with Power Strength & Glory 
 January 3, 1837 ~ TuesdayJan. 3rd 1837 At early Candle light I repared to the house of the Lord in company with Elder Milton Holm^e^s for the purpose of Meeting with the quorum of the Seventies.President Aldrich opened the meeting by Prayer & after a few appropriate remarks from President Coltrin about twenty of the third Seventy was ordained to the high Priesthood & as members of the third Seventy ^{under the hands of the above named Presidents.}^ After this ordinance was Performed Elder Holms & myself was called upon by the above named Presidents to come foreward to be ordained as members of the first Seventy Elders of Israel to bear the name of Jesus to the nations of the earth. The first Seventy was Chosen out of the Camp that went up to Zion for the redemption of our brethren in the Spring of 1834. but as we were not present when they were chosen we were afterwards chosen in the second Seventy but their now being two vacancies in the first we were chosen to fill them. President Aldrich ordained Edder Holms to this appointment & Pronounced great blessings upon his head. President Zebedee Coltrin Ordained me as a member of the first Seventy & Pronounced great Blessings upon my head by the spirit of Prophecy & Revelation Some of them I will mention which are as follows THAT my enemies would confine me in prisions & chains & that I should rend the prisions & chains in twain in the name of JESUS & that the Lord would give meGreat Power, Knowledge, & wisdom that I should heal the sick cause the blind to seethe lame to leap, the Deaf to hear, stop the mouths of Lions, rase the dead waft myself from river to river from sea to sea & that I should stand before Kings &Princes & that they would send for me to receieve wisdom, Knowledge, & instruction at my mouth because they consider'd me wiser than they in like manner as the Egyptians sought wisdom at the hand of JOSEPH And that 
 God would give me a multiplicity of blessings that I should Preach to the nations of the Earth & the inhabitants upon the Islands of the sea & that I should then return & stand upon Mount Zion in the flesh even in Jackson County Missouri at the Cumming of Christ & that I should be cought up to meet him in the clouds of heaven for he said thus was the word of God unto me & Also that I should visit COLUB & Preach to the spirits in Prison & that I should bring forthfrom the Terrestrial Kingdom all my Kinsman ^who had Died^ by Proclaiming the gospelunto othem. These & many other Blessings were Pronounced upon my head& further said that I should be annointed & my life sealed up & thentheir would be still greater blessing Pronounced upon my head. I felt much of the Power of God rest upon me in this ordinance & bear witness of the truth of the above PROCLAMATION See May 29th 1836 in this Journal 
 VISIONI Willford Woodruff being in the spirit on the eve of the 2nd Day of Jany AD 1836 mine understandingwas enlightened and mine eyes were opened to look within the veil and behold the things that are tocome, things which must yet be fulfilled. an angel said unto me look and I looked and beheld greatand marvelous things that are to transpire spedily many in this generation. I saw a Judgment thatdoth await Babylon the great. I saw signs in the east as a warning to the nations and to fullfull theProphets III X II [FIGURES]I beheld the sun turn to darknes and the Moon to Blood and the horizon covered with burningCities as is to come upon Babylon I saw seven golden Lions sit in the heavens as burningbrass but the meaning was taken from me. I saw the resurrection of the Celestial Kingdomor the inhabitants theroff whose glory was that of the first born they were arayed in whitegarment of fine lining most beautiful & fair. I saw the resurrection of the Terrestrial Kingdomwhose glory was lesser than the Celestial. The earth hove from its capacious bed that Immor-tality might rest upon them and they came forth out of their graces. Great peace, joy, happiness,and glory immortality and Eternal Life reigned in the Celestial and Terrestrial KingdomsGreat and marvelous were the things shown unto me while in the spirit I beheld a personageappear in the Clouds of heaven and while looking at the greatness and majesty and thestory of these things the veil was closed from my view and I awoke and my rest was seelunto me And if I cannot write all that I saw I testify that what I have written is true

 Eastern States Mission,Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints,No. 50 Concord Street,Brooklyn, N. Y.Brooklyn, Dec 15, 1897. 189Prest. Wilford Woodruff,Salt Lake City,Utah.My dear Brother: With pleasure I hand you herewith our financialreport for the past three months. You see we are able to keep ourhead above water, and we have a very nice office to invite ourstrangers in to see us, such as news paper reporters ect. IndeedI am happy to say we have a very comfortable conference house.I am prepared to receive our brethern as they come totheir fields of labor. We have about 120 Elders in this field andit seems as though we could use that many more to a good advantageWehave only baptized upwards of 100 people since my time here, butI think that is fairly good when we consider that nearly all ofour Elders are new in the field. Our Neophites, what we have aregood inteligent people, and we are educating them hiow to paytithing and live their religion.I have been all through the field twice and have organizedEleven Conferences. Our Elders are full of faith and determinedto do their duty. Part of them travel without money. Recentlywhile I was at Boston holding conference I met an old member ofour Church who was Baptized by Prest. Young and he has not seenone of our Elders before for 45 Yrs. With love to your self andCoworkers, I remain, with prayers for "Zion's" triumph,Your brother,  A P KeslerVery good letter.J. F. S.

 Eastern States Mission,Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints,No. 50 Concord Street,Brooklyn, N. Y.Brooklyn, Sep 15, 1897.  189Prest. wilford woodruff,Salt Lake City, Utah.My dear Brother:With much pleasure I hand you here-with our financialreport of this mission for the past quarter ending on this date.Our efforts in this part of "Zion" asmissionaries seem to be al-most with-out success, but still I do not feel to complain, as Ibelieve that god is with this workand if we are persistant andprayerful we shall be led to the honest in heart.  Since my ar-rival in this mission -six monthe ago- we have only baptizedSeventy persons; this is but a small number when compared with thegreat multitude that yourself and Uncle Orson Pratt immersedwhile you were in WEngland.Our brethern here mostly travel without money, andespecially is this the case in the rural districts.  There seemsto be a slight spirit of investigation in the New England StatesOur Elders have recently baptized a family in Main that Prest.Cannon referred me to.  Some little intrest is manifest on FoxIsland and near Boston also.  Our Brethern are received very kind-ly by the people in the West and south of Pa.Ever praying for the welfare of our Church and solicitingany suggestions that you may have to offer, I remain,Your brother,A.P. Kelser

 Wonder if Cousin Azmon really thought that your Father & Mother would go there in preferanc to Nauvoo. True he made them a very goodoffer but I presume he did not expect they would accept it. Henry Woodford has frequently told me that Azmon was no better off as to propertythan he was when he left Connecticut. I suppose he knows as well respecting his situation as any one of his friends[sideways text] Do continue to intercide the Throne of Grace in behalf of my poor afflicted Mother & if you can get faith for her recovery do get it:Mother generally rests tolerably well nights, & has quite an appetite this is what seems to keep her up—her nervous system is most exciteable I ever saw. My Brother is tolerably well. [end of sideways text]Farmington June 28th 1845Cousins Wilford & PhebeWhile enjoying the pleasure of a visit with your dearparents in Farmington, in company with my Mother & being favored with moreleisure time than has been my privilege for a long season, I thought I would improve afew moments in addressing a few lines to you. I have not ^much^ of interest to communicatebut I wish to acknowledge the receipt of your letter and some papers, (the "Star," which weregratefully received.) as also to give you some information respecting Mother's present ofstate health &c. It gave us all pleasure to learn that you were still in the enjoymentof good health & spirits & that so good a degree of prosparity attended your labors in the ministryand we will ever esteem it a privilege to hear from you by letter & know of your prosprtyboth in temporal, & spiritual things, & I doubt not but you feel equally desirious to knowconcerning the welfare of your kindred & friends in this land. Your Mother has nearlycompleted a letter to you in which she will give an account of herself & family & things appertaining to them & I will inform you a little respecting our family &co. There has been no verymaterial change with mother since I wrote, nor since you visited us last fall. I have howeverconsidered her rather on the decline, indeed I know that her health in general is has notbeen near as good as it was last summer. Her situation has been such for a long time thatthat it has often appeared to me that we must all perish together for the want of strength to endureNot long since we came to the conclusion that somthing must be done, some new measureadopted, & we finally decided to procure some good place & hire Mother boarded a short seasonwe accordingly engaged a place, but when the time arrived for her to go she was determinedagainst it & manifested feelings of such a kind that we could not, neither would we urge her,but thought we might adopt some better plan or at least more congelial to her feelings.It was next proposed that I should accompany her on a visit to Farmington, & we finallysucceeded in that thing. We hired a horse & chaise, rode very slow, made a number of callsbut when we arrived here, she was quite fatigued, more so I presume on account ofher being lo[a]th[e] to come & worrying all the way about it. What effect this visit will have 
 July 3upon her I am not able to say. One week has now expired since we came here &I cannot say that I think she is any better though not quite as noisy, yet she is beginningto worry and tease in the usual strain, even now she is in a panic while I am stealinga moment to write in my chamber, I had not thought it would be so when I comm-enced these lines but I find she will not allow me to be out of her sight a momentand might as well attempt to read or write in Bedlam as with her. I must now quitbut will give a little further account by & by.I find Aunt Woodruff's letter abut ready for Mailing & as I intend enclosingthis in her sheet I must hasten its completion, & omit any further particularsrespecting Mother. You will ^be^ able to discover that she is about the same aswhen you left. As it regards my own health it still remains quite poor as is thecase with Sister Ann's, but by the goodness & mercy of God we have been ennabled tokeep about & take ^care^ of our poor afflicted Mother—notwithstanding we often feel thatwe must sink beneath the weight of our afflictions.Since I came here I have been informed respecting Uncle Ozem & family, they areall in comfortable health excepting Francis, he has been confined a long time witha lingering disease & it is thought by his physicians that he will not recover—none of them have visited Farmington since you were here. I long to see thembut cannot have the privilege. I shall expect to return home in the course of 2 or 3 daysif my Brother can make it convenient to come after us. I would like to make a longervisit, but I fear that we should be burdensome. Aunt Bulah has finally made us a visitfor the first time since you left & is enjoying comfortable health, she has be^e^n very poorduring the winter & spring—but is now quite well. Please write as often as you can. It trulydoes our souls good to hear from absent friends especially while under deep affliction. I havesomtimes thought we were almost forgotten because far away. Cousin Webster has never writtenus & I do wonder very much as we have always been so good friends. You would be more excuseablebecause of your many responsibilities, but I think it must be the want of a disposition in them.I must close by wishing you health peace & prosperity. Your CousinBetsey.The prophet is to be discontinued a short season if they can get few hundred additional subscribers it will again make its appearance.Betsey CossettFarmington June 28 1845[sideways text]Your parents appearto enjoy themselves exc-cedingly well. I doreally think they havea delightful situation,their house muchbetter & more conven-ient than the one theyformerly occupied.Your Father appearsto be rather failing, hehas some po[o]r turnsbut still does provideall the comforts of life& has assisted CousinDwight & Euniceconsiderable.I have neither seen norheard anything fromBr.

 Nauvoo, May 8, 1845Elder Wilford WoodruffBeloved BrotherYours of the 1st ult. post marked the 4th, was receivedyesterday, also one from Elder Hedlock containing a schedule of the business andsituation of the office, 36 Chapel Street, also one from Wm and Charles Millerof Manchester, ^to B. Young^ all of which We propose briefly to answer on this sheet to save time, forWe are somewhat busy with a variety of matters.We rejoice at the cheering intelligence you communicate concerning thework of the Lord in the Old World, and pray unceasingly for your prosperity, andare satisfied with your printing, and securing the Copy right of the book of Doctrinesand Covenants, and if it is possible for you, it is wisdom also to forestall our—enemies in France, and Germany; and secure the copy right in those ^or any other^ countries, andalso the Book of Mormon, in the name of Brigham Young, President of the Churchof Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.We are satisfied with Elder Hedlock's proceedings, and have been satisfied, anddoubt not he has done the best he could; You intimate that you think it notbest "to send any more poor, gratis." It is more than a year since, we notified ElderHedlock to send us more Emigrants at our expence. And it was one of thepositive instructions given to yourself, before your departure from Nauvoo, to sendno man, woman, or child to America at the expense of the office, and we trustthat this last repetition of these instructions, at the 11th hour, will suffice. If anyone has paid Pratt or Fielding, or Clark, or any body else, Let that body furnishthe passage according to contract.We are glad if Elder Ward has made enough by printing to sustain himself,and that he is ready to co-operate with you in all things: If he were disposed to claimthe continuance of the privilege of printing, on account of the licence given him by ElderPratt; all queries might be easily solved, by the simple question. Who gave ElderPratt the privilege of printing in England? Yourself or any one acquainted withthe circumstances can solve this problem.William Miller in his letter, wished me ^(B. Young)^ to do him "the favor to hand over£5 which I have, of his, to his brother Thomas Miller at sight." In reply I can trulysay, I have no recollection of any £5 of his, or any other amount in my hands, whichhe will probably understand if he will think a moment. William Miller sent £5to Elder Kimball to purchase a piece of Land. And Elder Kimball purchased the land— 
 according to his request; and at a subsequent period, Elder Kimball gave ThomasMiller one sovereign or more on William's account, but the Land is here yet, and if William Miller wants the money for it, he had better authorize Elder Kimball or anyone he chooses, to sell it for him, the money can then be forwarded to William orgiven to Thomas if he can be found. The last news from him, we heard he was atSt Louis. Brother Charles Miller's writing, breathes the Spirit of the Gospel, we havenot time to answer them now. please inform them as above.^Sent a copy of the above to Wm Miller^Should Greenhow, or any of Rigdon's satellites arrive in your midst; you canby anonymous communication, through the Post office, inform the police, how Rigdon,their leader, declared on the public stand at Nauvoo, "that he held the keys ofconquest, and that he would conquer England, and take little Vic by the nose,and lead her out of her palace &c &c" as you heard it, and brother Clark also.this will be sufficient to cause him to be closely watched by police in citizensdress, and if he does not keep himself pretty strait, the proper authorities willattend to his case.^[FIGURE]^ It is a part of our religion, to support any government, wherever wemay be, that will protect us in common with other citizens, for to this end governmentsare instituted. And as England has ever been true and faithful to us as apeople, in common with others: The Elders cannot be too particular to enjoinon all Saints, to yield obedience to the laws, and respect every man in his office.Letting politics, entirely, totally  and absolutely alone, and preach the first—principles of the gospel of salvation, for to this end were they ordained andsent forth. ^[FIGURE]^We are for peace, we want no contention with any person or government,and should war commence between England and America &c &c It will probablybe wisdom, for you, and all the American Elders, to return immediately home, andleave all parties to fight their own battles. ^[FIGURE]^Some of the caps are placed on the pilasters of the Temple, and all willbe completed in 3 or 4 weeks, with our usual prosperity. The stone are in rapidprogress, for the new font. The wall for the foundation of the pickets, or railing,around the Temple Block, and the block west of the Temple (to be in one) is alsocommenced. The brick are making for the Nauvoo House—140,000 feet of pinelumber were received last Saturday, for our public buildings; another raft is expectedsoon, and we anticipate they will all be enclosed early in the fall. The arsenal isrising on the first story above the basement. Emigration has been greater than usual 
 this season, means are more plenty: and if you succeed in your joint stockcompany, as you anticipate; a world of business may be done here next season;should ^that^ perfect peace, and union continue, which now prevails. Rigdonismhas run its race in this country. It appears quite harmless when let alone,we have heard of but one they have baptized in America as yet, and that wasan old apostate, and all that Rigdon has gathered out of the Church, are of noaccount, they have ever been doubtful at the best, no honest man can bedeceived by such foolish sophistry and lies. We have killed it, by letting italone. Brother Webster is lame, but out. Sister Webster is better than whenyou left, "Little Willie" was at Dr Richards last week, bright as a dollar. It isa time of health in the "City of Joseph." The circuit court sits week after next.The mob are preparing to try to raise an excitement of some kind, we dont knowwhat, but confidently hope and believe they will have little power over us. In God, is our hope. We have little praying circles frequently, and your request has beenattended to.Elder Reuben Hedlock will make a safe, judicious, and trustworthyagent for the English Joint Stock Co, and we recommend him to the Stock hold[ers] [wax seal]for that purpose.We forward you with this, in a package a letter of Attorney, constitutingyou an agent to transact all necessary business for the Church in theUnited Kingdom of Great Britain, and on the continent of Europe.Wishing you every blessing, we subscribe ourselves, your brethrenin ChristBrigham Young President—Willard Richards Clerk—N.B. We have it might be very agreeable to the feelings of the English brethren to furnish a bell for the Temple. If thisis their pleasure, you can forward it the first conveyance & wewill have it hung as the building is going up. We arebut little acquainted with the weight of bells, we have thought of 2000 pounds, but we leave this to your judgmentwe want one that can be heard night or day. If the dutieson such castings are too high, you will act accordingly to give us notice. B. Y.W. R.

 W. Woodruff wished to express his feelings. I consider it to be my duty to bear in afew words my test[imony] this da[y]—while I have heard the remarks of my brother this morn[ing]this is what Jesus s[ai]d anciently can not ye discern the signs of the times [##Matthew 16:3##] - if [yo]u cannotit it is bec[ause] they walk in darkness - it [h]as sometimes been a mystery how the L D Shave been gov[erned] ^?^ - even when the P[rophet] was living - when they [h]av[e] taken awa[y] your chu[rch]? tell uswhy they heed your counsel - it is not bec[ause] the P[rophet]. S[eer]. & R[evelator] was here [againd] by a Rod of Iron 
 W. Woodruff--rejoice. & feel happy to see so many of the Saints together, who can enjoy the Blessing among us but the Saints. Now I must Bring into My Store House your tythes & offerings. & see if I will not Pour out a Blessing in Building a Temple unto God why I thought Looking on this Vast Congregation if they only Pd their tything how different with the appearance of things be in one yearwhy the Elders that you Sent forth from this place, they were full of the fire of the Lord and we felt it. when they came among us in the East I hope that the Building of the Seventie Hall will go on Worthy of this Great People, and the templeof the Lord progress rapidly among us. 
 but bec[ause] they [h]av[e] [h]ad a deg[ree] of that li[gh]t & bec[ause] they have seen the hand of God – hereagain we [h]av[e] only one dissenting voice – it is bec[ause] they see the Ke[y]s of the K[ingdom] – thedevil [h]as [h]ad [h]is da[y] & [h]ad [h]is dominion – the Ld now agn makes bare his arm& restores the P[riesthood] of the order of Melchizedek & Aaron & r called to bear off the K[ingdom]. – so man shall glory in His presence – Moses s[ai]d wh an I that I sh[oul]d be called to lead the p[eo]pl[e] [##Exodus 3:11##]the Ld God hath called men from the plow &c to round up their shoulders & in thename of the Ld God they r able & will carry it off & God will fulfil his promisesI test[ify] that this work is of God & whil[e] I see the arm of God made bare & when I seethe d[e]v[i]l trying to lead away the chil[dren] of men – men look upon the wrong side of thequ & the 1st thing they see is they [a]r[e] gone they [a]r[e] on the brink of destrcn – an I see menturn to the rit & the left & I know that they r as the wa[y] to damnation when I see Shayism & every other ism that is broken off from the prin[ciples] of truth, they go the way that os av done,& they will feel it & theyre is no or plan of Saln—I warn all men be careful of whatwav for I tell you that as the Lord God lives the Sword is ab[ou]t to fall on the fall ^South^ they[h]av[e] got to foot the bill & that is the reason why they [a]r[e] driving away the LDS thatthey may be hidden up – unite with the p[eo]pl[e] that God [h]as chosen – it matters notwho it is Moses or Joseph I leave the consequence with God who is able to alld to his arm[his] hand will go with his people while those who oppress this p[eo]pl[e] shall be oppressedwith what measure they mete shall be measured again. Why is all the South in arms agsthe LDS bec[ause] they [a]r[e] stirred up by the devil – the hearts of men [a]r[e] moved upon lestthe Saints should rule – the Ld is now going to work to set up his work & will accomplish it—evenI see America covered with cities, & begin to drive the Sts & shed their blood & refuse the cries of thep[eo]pl[e] that [a]r[e] offered up to them – the die is casts their doom is sealed & the LDS [a]r[e] not the onlyp[eo]pl[e] that will suffer by a p[eo]pl[e] who profess Christianity—I ask it will they escape judg-& escape their reward. I had rather fall in the mire & find a grave in the [wind] of beans 
 & said: I feel to withdraw my cit[izenship] from the nation I wod never manifest myfeelings in the [nation] – I will never vote for a P[rophet] as a [lyarv]? or any on. tarry notthe judgts [a]r[e] sure – the heavens [a]r[e] full of them & as the Ld God lives they will bepoured out on this nation – bear it patiently – J. C. came – the Jews rejected theirprinc[e] & crucd him – if they [a]r[e] exalted they [h]av[e] got to be exalted by the same Keysthat they have trodden under foot – altho they [h]av[e] killed Joseph Smith – they willhave something more to do with him, he will [h]av[e] something to do he will stand there &judge that p[eo]pl[e] he will judge Carthage – Tho he is d[ea]d he lives – he is ourSenator there he is our Rep. there – it is time that the pra[ye]rs of the LDS shdnot be offd to this [nation] lest that place where there cries will be heard. let notyour heart faint – the greater your trial & affln &c the greater will be yourexaltn – & bless this p[eo]pl[e] 
 Elder Wilford Woodruff said he wished to bear testimonyto what had been said and to say he considered the Companywho were going with hand carts ought to call on the greatand the learned the high as well as low & the Time had goneby when Elders had to go in at the back door and preachin the out houses and back houses, but he considered they were qualified to go in at the front door, and to preach in themost respectable places & churches wherever they went. he consideredthat they were going to bind up the law and seal up theTestimony to a portion of the Lords vineyard, and if theywent faithful & were right in the sight of the Lord theirtestimony would be followed by the power of God related aninstance of his going to Fox islands and going right to the Deaconof the congregation and telling him he had a message from the Lordand went in and baptized every man that owned a dollar in thatchurch.

 Anthy Lund live is apt to grow & morningMan is growing,W Woodruff, Melord in duality with thispeople began as with little children. At first youcould not get a man to go five miles only he first wentto bro Joseph, inquire of it to the will of the Lord, Butso now they are called to go to the Nations. Isles of the the Sandwich Isles, & they go without asking bro B to geta revelation about it. The people therefore on the [advice] they are improving. If this is an importantera in the K of G, & I am glad that the words sent tothe house of Israel, to esteem this the greaterpriviledge to go to on a mission to them rather than tothe nations that have shed the the blood of the Prophets.If we have the spirit of this I shall understand thesigns of the times & want to go to Cala. The judgmentof this I am going to visit the Earth, he will plead with them with the sound, with famine & pestilence, & he willsend messengers to them that cannot rebuke, they willfulfil their mission. The spirit has been deemed a burdenwhile [ashort] realized that [dont] grown here has been sentas much as the mannaa was to the C of I, I have nofears for the saints of the Lord if we are faithful & seek hisspirit. All the improvements & blessings the world has receivedhas been given by inspiration of the Lord, & they do not acknowledge his hand & He is angry with them. So they the acknowledgehis hand & we shall be blessed. It is wonderful to see thismanifestation of his power this people have received you cantpoint out another place where there are as may helping as thereare here. We have evil in our midst but the majority aretrying to do right, & we are not [andested] in ^our understanding of the^one would of DelightLord.I am glad to be here to see your place faces to be travelingsouth, with them Co. You have not the privilege of meetingwith the Presidency every sunday but you can have theLord with your, and his spirit among you
