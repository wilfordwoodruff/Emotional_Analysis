Woodruff  One family letter, the other personal   On the return of the brethren from meeting they informed me  that President Brigham Young had preached one of the greatest sermons he had ever deliverd on earth the following are the items Delivered to me of his sermon by Jonathan C Wright  ^but mostly from Thomas Bullocks report which was copied from his report^   FIGURES He Arose and said By our acts  we have said to the world we are  Christs and we have exhibited it more than any other (of the  Christian world). Evry thread and tie that binds man to man has been broaken assunder (in consequence of receiveing the fulness  of the Gospel of Christ.) Men have left their wives, wives their husbands children their parents and parents their children (Brothers  their sisters and sisters their Brothers in order to be gathered with the saints of God that they might partake of salvation). This people  have proven to the world by their acts that they have a knowledge of  the way of life and salvation. This people have proven (to all men)  that they can sacrafize evry endearment (in this life) for (Eternal)   ENDENTRY life and salvation and we prove that we bear this principle through evry difficulty (which we are called to pass through) it is our duty  to make evry sacrafice that is required of us so that our Father  in heaven, the Holy Angels, and all Just men who sit enthroned in glory power, and dominion may look upon us in this capacity ie that  is that they may see in their Kingdoms that we do prove to them that we are willing to make evry sacrafize ^if i may call it a sacrifize^ on Earth endearing to man in order that we may secure a seat with them in  Eternal light and glory. (But not withstanding all the light and knowledge we have of life and salvation) do you not see how easy it is for us  to turn away to the right and to the left and say and do many things which we afterwards regret and wish we had not done is it not the case with us all more or less, it is. I see a thousand weakness in myself that I ^now^ regret and it is so with all those who have the light of the spirit of God they can see their weaknesses (and regret them and they will try to over come them I can not ownly see these things  in myself but I can see them in my brethren for when I learn myself and Brigham I learn my brethren by this rule I know all of you) we give way to temptation and angry feelings against  our Brother and want to be revenged on them. I ask is this a righteous feeling, No it is not, and yet we live day by day and  week byafter week and year after year in this year way, the People will be guilty of a little lying a little swareing a little deceiving and a little stealing. do you think that you can repent of all your sins and be forgiven in a moment. no you cannot, evry latter day  saint knows better, this would be sectarianism, the religion of the world is that a man may commit Murder and when on the  gallows he can repent and be forgiven and go right straight to Abrah- ams bosom but this is fals doctrin it is not true. Some say that I cannot over come my passions when I am tempted and  tried I cannot help giving way to my feelings I must  give vent to them and scold and sometimes Sswear swear and  I cannot help it. But I tell you that you can help it you have got to help it sometime or other or you cannot be saved you have got to begin to learn to over come, you should begin to im- prove day by day. Shun the errors as you see them and improve  upon them be better men and women tomorrow than you are to day Continue to improve there is not a man or woman here  but what can do better here than they do. But says one  Brother Brigham says hard words. So I do use harsh  words. I am Death and Hell on the wicked, but you never hear me speak evil of my brethren. But I will reprove wickedness among the Human family. As your leader I will say let us try to improve our lives. Let us overcome evrery  temper and evil passion that arises within you you can shut your mouth and keep your tongue still and quiet, and the next time you are tempted you can overcome it easier. Keep  silence and it will give you a great victory. Mothers when you  are cross and attempt to correct your children conquer your- selves first. Fathers when you feel any of the evil passions  of your natures arise then you need the grace of God to help bring yourselves into subjection that you may go in the spirit of meekness untill you get the victory over your feelings. we  are liable to get out of the way we should not do wrong knowingly   ENDENTRY for if we say or do things which are wrong we are under obligation to confess our faults, it would be a hard matter for me to confess that I had done wrong knowingly. You should be governed by righteousness. Let every Elder in Israel look upon his brethren  and sisters like little children. when a person does a wrong in his foolish weekness look upon it as such. (we see the children of man laboring hard to obtain wealth they labour night and day to obtain this object) but wealth will not give you wisdom, but  if you will shun evil and extend the hand of charity to evry living  being and do good to all (as far as you have an opportunity) this will  grow in you and you will increase (in wisdom and knowledge) we  should live so as to enjoy the spirit of Revelation that we may know the will of God concerning us in all things. You should  not live for yourselves alone for if your Affections are not  placed on the Lord Jesus Christ and do not possess charity you will mis the gate (and not enter into the glory of God yourselves) for you will not receive the spirit of the gospel, your hearts should be  empted of evry thing but the spirit of the gospel. (that you may be  filled with the spirit of Revelation that you may know the voice of the good shepherd for if this people was to loose the spirit  of revelation and turn from righteousness they would be liable  to be led down to hell but while the people keep the spirit of God and of Revelation with them they would know the voice of the good shepherd.) If I was to get out of the way  would not all that had the spirit of God see it, as they did Sidney  and Wm Smith, yes they would. When Sidney Rigd- on claimed to be the shepherd and leader of this people the people knew not his voice. But when the true shepherd spoke unto  them they knew his voice and they followed him. It is the duty of this people and their privilege to live in such a manner that  they cannot be deceived by any deceiver. It is your duty to  live your religion. No man can magnify the priesthood and their  calling unless they live their religion, unless they are filled with the spirit of revelation, of the Holy Ghost, and of the Holy Priesthood then they can magnify their calling and do their duty to their Neighbor and to all men then their would be an end to Bishops and High Councils trials. Parents are under the deepest obligation  to live their religion And the young men and women also that when you get married your children may be begotten in Holiness and born in Holy^iness^ Brought forth into the world in Righteousness and then you cannot make any thing but Saints of them. Begin  your work right Carry it on right. Bring up your children right then when they are old they will not depart from it.  This is the coven- ant which God made with Abraham that to his seed there should be no end. And this promise was made to him when he was childless He received this covenants from the Lord and desired to see them fulfilled upon the Earth. Abraham was driven from his Father's house after  he was driven f had received the Priesthood. The Lord Bestowed his Priesthood upon him by a man whose name was Melchisedek when Abraham received the Presthod the people were so wicked  that no man would receive him but the Lord promised him a seed through whom the Holy Priesthood should be perpetuated  forever and that to the increase of his seed there should be no end The Lord promised to Abraham this great blessing A man can  have no greater Blessing than was promised to him that He should   ENDENTRY have Children who should have the priesthood. I would not  ask the Lord for any greater blessing than this for myself the  Lord Promised him that the various ordinances of his Kingdom  should be administered through his posterity forever where ever the kingdom of God existed. Then let evry child for the future  be begotten in Holiness and remember this one thing live your religion I now want to speak of another thing. A vary small portion of  our time was spent in the Nauvoo whare we began to ad- minister the ordinances according to the words of Malachi in the 4th ch 5th and 6 verses "Behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the  coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord." "And He shall turn  the Hearts of the Fathers to the children and the hearts of the children to  their Fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse" Abram received the promise from the Lord that his seed should  be saved. And all the seed of Abraham in all the Gentile Nations or  among the uncontaminated of the house of Israel will be gathered That have signned they have changed the Ordinances, and broaken their covenants, or you would not see the children of these Mountains  in the degredation in which we now find them. The Lamanites upon  this continant are Manassehites almost exclusively, their is but  little of the seed of Ephraim among them, they are counted as  the seed of Abraham and they must be saved or they would  not have become so loathsome as they are, they are punished  in the flesh to make an attonement in the flesh for their  sins and transgressions, and when they pass through the veil the  enemy has no power over them. In the day of the Lord Jesus Christ  all the particles of the Blood of Abraham will be gathered together  The seed of Abraham has not been counted for many years  nor never will be again. If an Angel was to commence now to number them all when he had got the numbers together before  they could be computed there would be a great number more  born during the time of there numerration so they could not be  numbered and this is the reason why his seed cannot be numbered Brethren and sisters you are of the seed of Abraham and you should live  your legio religion that you may claim the promises of Abraham This priesthood will turn the hearts of the children to the Ancient  Fathers and the children to the Fathers now and those which are to  come will be made perfect this chain must not broaken for  mankind cannot be saved any other way. This Priesthood must  be linked together so that all the children may be linked to Father  Adam. It may be asked when will this work be done, it will be  done in Temples in our day and in the days of our children. we shall  go into the Temples and be pillars therein and go no more out and we shall  plant trees and vineyards and eat the fruit thereof. I will call it the Millennium. I carry it in my heart I say it has begun   evry saint carries it with him then let us increase in evry  good thing and we will extend this influence from Zion untill  it roots out evry evil and brings iall in subjection to the Kingdom of our God. We will administer in the Temple which we have now  begun and that is one point gained and we will sealed men  to men by the keys FIGURE of the Holy Priesthood this is the  highest ordinance it is the last ordinance of the Kingdom of God  on the earth and above all the endowments that can be  given you it is a finall sealing an Eternal Principle   ENDENTRY and when once made cannot be broaken by the Devel  when we return to Zion and build the great Temple which Joseph  saw and the centre of Zion is Esstablished the glory of God  will rest upon it by day and by night and those that are prepared  will see the face of the sun of man and they will see Joseph and  Hiram in the flesh in their resurrected bodies. Then will the  armies of Israel be terrible to all Nations then will one chase  a thousand and two put ten thousand to Flight. Who will resurrect  Joseph's Body? It will be Peter, James, John, Moroni, or some one  howho has or will receive the keys FIGURE of the resurrection it will proba- bly be one of those who hold the keys of this dispensation and has  deliverd them to Joseph and you will see Jesus and he will eat peaches  and Apples with you but the world will not see it or know it for  wickedness will increase. Joseph and Jesus will be there they will  walk and talk with them at times and no man mistrusts howho they  are. Joseph will lead the Armies of Israel whether He is seen  or not, whether visible or invisible as seemeth him good Joseph has  got to receive the keys of the resurrection for you and I. After he is  resurrected he will go and Bresurrect Brother Brigham Brother Carloss, and when that is done then He will  say now go Brother Brigham and resurrect your wives and children and  gather them together while this is done the wicked will know nothing  of it though they will be in our midst and they will be struck with  fear this is the way the resurrection will be all will not be raised at once  but it will continue in this way untill all the righteous are res- urrected. After Joseph comes to us in his resurrected body He will  more fully instruct us concerning the Baptism for the dead and the sealing  ordinances. He will say be baptized for this man and that man and that  man be sealed to that man and such a man to such a man, and  connect the Priesthood together. I tell you their will not be  much of this done untill Joseph comes. He is our spiritual Father  Our hearts are already turned to him and his to us. This is the order of  the Holy Priesthood and we shall continue to administer in the ordin- ances of the kingdom of God here on Earth. Joseph will not officiate  in this low capacity any more neither did Jesus after his Resur- rection if so he would have baptized Saul but he was exhalted above  the Earth and he told Saul to go to a certain man in a certain street  and he would administer to him the ordinances upon the Earth. I say  to you dont hurry in the ordinances dont do what you ought  not it is not time to hurry we should not under take to do now  what we ought to do 50 years hence. what have we to do to day. Purify  your hearts that you may receive the manifestation of the spirit  of God. When you sow your wheat you prepare the ground then sow your wheat and watch it untill the hearvest it is Just so in the  priesthood you will be just as busy as you can be to do the things  which are to be done to day. Now dont be in a hurry I say we are going  to have time enough. I say I will be on the Earth to do all I can. And after I die and get my body again my resurrected body I mean to come  back to the Earth again and fight the Devils and be here at the winding up  scene I want to see righteousness prevail and the saints have peace on the earth   I wish now to speak upon another subject I am here as the  Governor of this Territory. And I wish to commence my remarks  upon this subject with the President of the United States. Is he the  Master of the United States no he is not. He is selected to sit there   ENDENTRY as one of our servants to act for us to do what we wish to have done  so it is with the congress and the Governors of the several States and  I am here as one of them as the servant of the people. Congress has prepared a constitution for this Territory which they call  the organic act and have granted certain rights to this people as  a community. They have said this Territory should be organized  thus and so with a Govornor and Legislative Assembly and the  right is given to the people to select 26 Representatives and 13  councellors Annually this body may enact Laws to controll each  of us and all the inhabitants of this Territory including the governor  the Judges the Secretary the supreme coart the District court  and the Probate court. they have said they shall have all the  power given to them by the Legislative assembly we have a Legislative  Assembly and Magistrates courts congress will send certain men to hold supreme courts and send other men as officers to the Territory  of Utah to transact business for the Territory of Utah so as to  make it as easy as possible. The United States Judges are not  here as Kings or Monarchs but as servants of the people  And when you see a Judge puting a city under Martial Law they  manifest Boyism and you should pitty them and give them a peace of  cake. If a man wants to be what he is not it is certain that He  wants to get out of his sphere. when some men know a  hundred words He thinks he knows all of webster some will try to study a hundred sciences of the day and then know no  more than a child. when a person studies Divinity 5 years they are ownly fit to be put down upon the ground as a block  to stand upon to get upon your horses. I see some here who  have come 50 or 100 miles at the squawking of a goose crow and  dont you know if you want a court had there that the  Judge should go there and hold it. And if a Judge dont know this  it is because he is vary ignorant And He ought to   learn his  duty. I am perfectly asstonished at these my Brethren to think  that if a man takes a pumpkin and says it is an Apple you must acknowledge that it is an Apple and swallow it as such or if they  take a rotton potatoe and say it is a peach then cram it down your  throat as a peach. when you see a rotton Potatoe why dont you  acknowledge it is a rotten potatoe. Now I say to you Jurymen  and witnesses pack up your dudds and go home and stay there till you  have business. If I come here and act the tyrant insted of a Gover- nor you ought to kick me out and all officers ought to be  served in the same way when they get out of the way and act the fool  or els let the people swallow the rotten potatoe and call it a peach  I know the meaning the marrow and the pith of the Laws and the  vary principle upon which they are built much better than the  Judges do I know the meaning of them and the Duty of all the officers in this Territory I say this for your instruction   To see men come here at the calling of a foolish boy, freezing  your toes and killing your horses in the cold month of December is foolish- nesh when you want him send for him and pay your respects to  him but they do not understand the Law. take some of the  boys and learn them sumthing and treat them as Gentlemen and make  them treat you as a Gentleman. when I see Lawyiers and Judges rising  up here and saying that our laws are not right and we should not  be governed by them, It puts me in mind of the Anecdote of the   ENDENTRY of the fox that went to a hen coop to cketch some chickens the owner had  had put a cord from the platform to a Bell overhead so as soon as the  platform was tuched the bell would ring as soon as the fox jumped  onto the platform the bell rung and away the fox run with all his might but  on looking behind him he saw nothing so he went back to the coop and examined to see what the matter was He touched the cord with his foot and it rung but  did no hurt so he jumped into the coop and got his chicken He looked up  and saw the bell was hollow and had a longue tongue and the Fox exclaimed  you are a poor miserable hollow headed Devil. Lawyiers and Judges should  be made to keep the Laws of this Territory as well as other citizens and if they  wont do it put them in a the way that they will be made to. And I  say to evry man who has no business here pack up your goods and go home  Let the Judges honor me, and our laws and the officers of this Territory  or they will not receive any honor from me.   I see one man on my right who will go strait and tell the judges  what I have said he is a kind of perpetual Telegraph and if any man come to me and says Brother Brigham do you mean me I will  say you are the Man.

Pratt said that He believed  the Gods had a knowledge at the present time of evry thing that ever  did exhist to the endless ages of all Eternity. He believed it as much  as any truth that he had ever learned in or out of this church. President  Young remarked that he had never learned that principle in the Church  for it was not taught in the church for it was not true it was fals doctr- in. For the Gods and all intelligent Beings would never scease to learn  except it was the sons of perdition they would continue to decrease  untill they became dissolved back into their native Element and lost  their Identity.

Preached a good discourse. He told the bishop to cut off all the  Liars thieves, Adulterers, and profane swarers from the church for they  would rot the body if they continued on it. and many wicked men  would stick by the church but they would never repent of their  sins their was a time when men could repent and have the spirit  of God but when that time was past men might pray till their  knees were callaced and they could not get the spirit of God. How long did  the people that were destroyed in the flood have to wait before they could have  the offer of the spirit of God or the gospel, they had to wait more than two  thousand years till after Christ came and was crusiphfied. He then went  and preached to the spirits in Prision. the gospel was then offered unto  them. And how has it been with the Jews they once saw the day when the   ENDENTRY gospel was offered unto them but when they put to death  their king and savior the gospel was taken from them and given to the  gentiles it was also given to the Lamanites and ten tribes of Israel. the  first were to be last and the last first it will now come to the gentiles  first then to the ten tribes of Israel and to the Lamanite before it will go  to the Jews they will be the last to received it who has ever herd  of the Jews having the spirit of God, or the Gospel, or kingdom of God  offered to the Jews since they put to death Jesus Christ and the kingdom  went to the Gentiles. No one for it has never been done. they will go  home in unbelief and wickedness and rebuild Jerrusalem in that state and they  will be so far from the gospel that when the Gentiles come against them  to battle rifle their houses ravish their women and carry half of their  city into captivity and Jesus Christ comes and delivers them in the midst  of this hour ^of^ perrill and trouble they will not know him or even imagin  Ho he is till they ask him about his wounds and he tells them that  the gospel has to be preached to them and they repent and are baptized and receive  the first principles of the gospel.   He also said their was a promise  that the three Nephites and angels should visit the Lamanites but they could not be sent to them with messages to receive and obey the Mormons untill  all the Mormon Missionaries were righteous men and would not steal, lie,  sware or commit Adultery for if the Angels were to tell them to obey  the Mormons and they found the Mormons to do wickedly they would loose  confidence in both the Mormons and the Angels    ENDENTRY February 18, 1856 ~ Monday   18th I spent the day in the committee room to work at Books    ENDENTRY February 19, 1856 ~ Tuesday   19 I spent the day in the committee room I attended a party at  Mrs Kimballs school house with her schollars the evening was spent  in dancing and speaking    ENDENTRY February 20, 1856 ~ Wednesday   20 I spent this day in the committe room    ENDENTRY February 21, 1856 ~ Thursday   21st I spent this day in the committee room and the evening in the seventies Hall with the Polosophical society and herd many good  Essays speeches, songs and musical entertainment we had a good time    ENDENTRY February 22, 1856 ~ Friday   22nd I spent the day in the committe room and attended two meeting  in the evening one the Horticultural society and chose J.

His blood was shed and  that Nation had to be chastized in consequence of it and  they deserved it for they were worthy we know the  Blood of Christ was shed for the redemption of mankind He spoke of the Endowments in the temple said the people always were afraid of the truth and always prejudiced against the profits of God but that did not stop the spread of the work of God, some  say shall we stay here long I do not know but I can say that we shall stay as long as we wish to. If all the Nations of the  Earth were to come against us they could not drive us away  if we doing our duty before the Lord and put our trust in him and do unto all men as we would wish to be done by in all things and if all will do this we shall not have much trouble in the kingdom of God some think that we have not as much faith as we used to have I cannot believe this I believe we are advanceing in the kingdom of God. some are much tryed  because all are not healed that they lay hands upon but I do not feel so I had a case during conference concerning the case of  Sister Baris she was sick and I laid Hands upon her and blessed her with life and helth and went to meeting in an hour I had  word that she was dead. it did not try me. the Lord saw fit to take her and all is right. there is many duties devolving upon us and one of these duties are to pay our debts if I owe a man  and He comes to me and says you owe me so much and I need it  in my family I will pay that man to the full extent of  my power I will divide the last loaf with him. I consider  this one of our duties and I will say I never knew  a man get rich by taking great Interest neither  do I ever expect to. He requested the Brethren to remember the Twelve and administer in temporal things while they Administered in spiritual things   Sunday PM. Elder O. Pratt addressed the Assemb He arose and said I should have been pleased to have heard from Brother Woodruff and others if I had not been caled upon to speak I dont know when I have been mor Edifyed than in the discourses I have heard at this  conference esspecially the discours of Brother Parley  yesterday morning it was so plain and simple I tried  to enter into the feelings of the speaker. I tryed to bring myself to this scene and fancied to myself how I would feel in Hearing the message of Glad tidings that a savior was born and also in being associated with him in life then the sorrow of his being taken away and crucified  then the great Joy in his resurrection and his teachings while in his Immortal body. but when I think of the greater things which are to take place in our day I do not regret that I did not live in that day for there are greater things to come forth than was manifest in that day. For that kingdom of God of which all the prophets have spoken since the world began has now  come forth as a preparation for the second coming of Christ not coming to be born in a manger but He will   ENDENTRY come From Heaven clothed with all that great Glory and power of which the prophets have spoken no are we preparing for th^i^se great Event now if a stranger was to come to us they would not suppose that we were preparing for this great Event but was merely cultivating the Earth to raise potatoes corn wheat andc. I do not believe for a moment  that is the case for I do believe that this people are preparing for the Coming of Christ. what will take place at that time I have red in the book of mormon what that book says will take plase we can read the great things that are spoken in that Book. (He read some unto the people) I will take it to myself I will ^having^ not been as diligent in reading that Book as I should have been I have red many other books of late but not so much in the book of Mormon as formerly I have seen the time that I could read nearly whole Books in the book of Mormon without looking upon that book I am  trying to get all the sayings in the Books in my own mind  that are spoken concerning the signs of the times in the day  in which we live for I am well aware that it will over- take many as a thief in the night in the midst of the saints now let us look at the tokens or signs of the times that are passing before us as many as present themselves  to our minds. I will read a revelation given to P P Pratt and others "Jesus Christ will not come in the form of  a woman nor like a man walking upon the face of the Earth. but look forth for the Heavens to be shaken and the mountains to be laid low andc. when shall thes things be when the Angel shall sound his trumpet two events will take place at the same time, also the Lord said the La- manites shall Blossom as the rose in the wilderness now  we know that this will not take place in a moment  for we know it will take some time to prepare the  Lamanites for this work it will require a great miracle to bring that people to that state or it will take some great changes to bring it about this is but  one of the Events that is to take place before the coming of Christ. I am glad to hear the account of the brethren who have gone among that people I am satisfied that  that people will not be prepared to receive the blessings of God untill they cultivate the Earth and when this is done we  shall Have accomplished the great work but ^not^ untill that  time is done then sumthing will be done then we will be inspired to teach them. and ther children and  all men will be blessed who labour faithfully to bring  them to this state of things. Jacob shall flourish in  the wilderness the Lamanites shall blossom as the rose we shall hear of Israel and of their prophets and Revelations  in other parts of the Earth. I do not say that they will  have the priesthood from this people nor I do not  say they will not for there are other men who hold the FIGURE keys of the kingdom of God on the earth the Revela- tor and the three Nephits hold the keys of the kingdom of God and they will administer unto the children of men Zion shall flourish upon the Hills and rejoice excedingly   ENDENTRY upon the mountains when this revelations was given there was no gathering at all Kirtland I have no idea that the prophet himself knew at that  time whare this would be. we are now here in the mountains in fulfillment of that Prophesy and  Revelation. Also in the 40th chapter of Isaiah com- forting words were spoken concerning the Jews and Jerrusalem they were to go to Jerrusalem for they had received double reward for all their sins now comfort them a did all thes things take place in the wilderness in Zion and in Jerrusalem in the days of the ^Birth of the^ Savior No they did not then that same John Had yet to do a great work in the  Earth in the last days who first delivered the priesthood  to Joseph Smith the prophet and founder of the Church of  Christ in this dispensation it was this same John the  Baptist so he has fullfilled a part of his last day mis- sion. O Zion get thee up into the High mountains that bringest good tidings we say that this was not  done at its first organization. why shall Zion get  up into the High mountains why to Judge the Nations of the Earth. this people will know righteous Judgment this people will be protected and shall Judge the people  of the Earth. it is said God will pour out knowledge  and power upon Zion these are some of the things that will take place before the coming of Christ. now that we may know that this is the case see what the Lord says Behold the Lord will come He will gather his people and carry them in his arms. we have come up Here in these mountains. well now have we flourished yes we have, we have flourished yet not as much as we shall. the Lord has said that we shall be the rival of all people yet we are cautioned to beware of pride  lest we become like the Nephites of old and some prophets have said that we should be chastized that the church wandered in the wilderness were faint and ready to fall down this people from the commencement have passed through oppression and difficulty we that have not been in the church from an Early day and do not know the History of it can learn it by reading the News published  in Salt Lake City and we can Just as well read the future History and events of this church by reading the prophets that have spoken concerning us. shall we be in these mountains when Christ comes No at least head quarters will not be here it will have to be on more ground it will be in Jackson Co Mo we may leave some Millions here but the Head quarters will be on more ground where shall we go to the new  Jerrusalem whare there will be built a great Capitol and Temple and we have got to build it, we and all our children  who are 8 years old know that when we have tryed to build a city the Lord has suffered it to be thrown down so that we may have experince so that we shall know  how to build up a New Jerrusalem so that it will be exceptable unto the Lord so that it will never be thrown down but be saved and taken into Heaven   ENDENTRY and preserved in Eternity and when that is done Jesus Christ  will come to visit it Angels will come that will be  before the great day of Christ coming and our dwellings will  be overshadowed bwith a cloud by day and a pillow of fire  by night so we can see to get home without stumbling it will be the most improved plan of lighting up our  City. How will it be with the Lamanites they will  be the most important actors in the scene we shall  be secondly in that work they will be so delightful  and have such great knowledge of Architecture that  they will be able to build up a New Jerrusalem  then we shall go out throughout all the land to  gather all the remnant of Jacob the Lamanites to come  to the New Jerrusalem what For why that they may  be prepared to be caught up to meet Christ in the clouds  of Heaven then Christ will come and stand in the midst  of this people and they will be prepared to be caught up to  meet Jesus Christ in the air then do I want to have  lived in the day when Christ was born no I do not  I would rather live in this age now some of us may  live in that day to see the seed of Israel gathered what  should you expect we should expect to see Jesus come  but should we see him come without any sign No we  should see Angels flying through the Heavens crying  to all the Earth to prepare for the great day of Judgment  is coming what next should we see there will be a  sign that all people will see in all the Earth as Israel  made a calf to worship so will there be five foolish  virgins in the midst of all these signs. what shall  we hear then. we shall hear another Trumpet  sounded saying that the great day of God will come  upon Babylon that her bands are made strong so  that No man can loose them then shall the curtain  of Heaven be unfolded as a scroll so you can see  it as you would gaze upon a map then you may  know the time has come for the saints of God to be  caught up into Heaven that will be the great day for  the saints of God, but awful to the wicked then the  Earth will reel to and fro like a drunken man it will  be the greatest Earthquake there ever has been  On Earth what next will take place the graves of  the saints will be opened and they will come forth  out of their gravs clothed with glory Immortality  and Eternal life and Enter in to the cloud Jesus Christ  does not come yet for there is other signs to take  place. The Angels are to sound there Trumpets O  what must be the feelings of the people of all the Earth  when they see the Heavens opened and the New Jerrusa- lem with all its inhabitants and the resurrected saints all  asscend into the cloud while they are left upon the Earth  there feelings must be awful. there are many more  things I might speak of but time will not permit.  There is many of the greatest things to take place in our  day that has ever taken place on Earth are we prepared  I think not I mourn over this people to see them so   ENDENTRY stupid I feel that there hearts are more set upon the  things of their farms than they are to prepare for the  great day of the Lord. I pray the Lord to Bless us and  give us his Holy spirit to prepare us for his kingdom and  comeing for Christ sake Amen   at 7 oclock in the evening the people again assembled and  filled the House and they were addressed by W. Woodruff who  said Brethren and Sisters I am truly glad to meet with you in  the capacity of a quarterly conference and visit you as a mission  I am truly thankful that I have a mission appointed me in con- nextion with Orson Pratt two of the Twelve Apostles for  it is the first time since the organization of this church and Quorum  that I have had this privilege of being associated together with  those two men on a preaching mission ownly as we have met  ain a conference from time to time to transact business as a Quorum  I called them Apostles, is it true that they are apostles it is either true or false, if it false then your faith is vain your religion is  vain you have not the Kingdom of God with you nor the priesthood  with the blessings have you. but if you they are true Apostles  then you have the kingdom of God with you the Priesthood and the  keys of the kingdom of God and a presidency who hold the keys of the  kingdom of God on the Earth and govern that kingdom for the benefit  of the people then you are bound to listen to our words and teaching and  to the teaching of the presidency of this Church. when I arived in this  place I spent the night at Brother Steeds after I retired to  rest I prayed to the Lord to show me what he wished me to teach  to the people the spirit of the Lord said to me teach the people  to obtain the Holy spirit that they may receive teaching  then let the missionaries keep the spirit of the Lord with them and that will constantly dictate them what to teach  you have had a flood of light poured out upon you since the  commencement of this conference and we should listen to it  we should pay particular attention to our children and teach  them good things and not permit them to spend their time  in reading novels and filling their minds with fals hood and  folly and things wharein there is no profit which will lead  them asstray and make them fit subjects for destruction  when this is the case through the parents neglect they will  have to answer for that sin. The Bible Book of Mormon  and Doctrins and Covenant should be read by our children  instead of negro songs for whatever seed  is sown in the minds of our children the same kind of fruit  will be produced rest of page blank   ENDENTRY October 22, 1855 ~ Monday   Oct 202 I returned home to salt Lake City distance 15 mils    ENDENTRY October 23, 1855 ~ Tuesday to  ENDENTRY October 27, 1855 ~ Saturday   23 to 27 I spent the week at home.

W. Woodruff addressed the people and  said that when I look upon the mountains and vallies and hills and  dales and both in the Heavens and on Earth I behold a great  variety in all the works of God and in looking upon the portr- ait of the Presidency and Twelve I see no two men or things  look alike and what constitutes a part of the glory of God  is the great variety of his works so in the preaching of the  Presidency and Twelve each man might preach upon a different  subject and Handle it in a different manner yet all by the  same spirit and will edify the people. so I feel incouraged to think  that notwithstanding such a great flood of light and truth  has been presented to this people since the commencement of this  conference that the Lord will still give me sumthing that may edify the people this evening. I would warn the people to give  heed to the strong teachings and exertations which they have   ENDENTRY had presented to them during this conference this people should  give themselves to the studying of the revelations of God as con- tained in the Bible book of Mormon and Doctrin and Covenants   Some have thought they should follow the living Oracles and  neglect the study of all other Revelations but this is not  so all men should follow and harken to the living Oracles of  God but they should not neglect the study of the scriptures for  God has commanded it and any man that will search the  revelations of God thouroughly will be far better prepared  to carry out the council of the living oracles at all times   their is another subject that I wish to speak of and that is the  principle of recording the dealings of God with us here on  the Earth while all other prophets and Apostles record the dealings  of God with them why should not the Elders of this last dispensation  it is true that the Prophet Joseph wrote the History of the church  in his day and that testiment is now gladdening the harets hearts of  thousands while the testator is dead so with the Presidency  of the Church who are now leading us they keep a History  of the dealings of both God and man with them the History of  which will be interesting to millions of future generations  but does this excuse the many thousands of Elders and High  priest and Apostles who have travelled for many years and built  up this church and kingdom and had the gifts of the Holy Ghost  with them so they have had power to heal the sick and cast  out devils open the eyes of the blind unstop the ears of the deaf  cause the lame to leap as an heart and commanded the Elements  and they obey them. and have had guardian Angels to preserve  them from Danger and Death I say shall the Elders be blessed  with these things and not count them worth recording not  even make the mark of a pen to leave the Account on  record for their children and future generations to read I say  they should. I think the Lord requires this at our hands  and it is a Rich and Holy legacy which is Justly due our posterity And I do desire that the Elders of this church would keep a  history and Journal of their lives I also wish that our young  men would become acquainted with Phonography that we may  have one thousand reporters whare we have one now that  they may report the teachings of the servants of God and the work  of God in this generation many other remarks I made to the  people concerning the gathering of Israel and other subjects and was  followed by Elder Orson Pratt the spirit and power of God  rested us all during the conference I laid on hands upon a  sick woman with Brother Orson Pratt    ENDENTRY November 19, 1855 ~ Monday   19th In company with Orson Pratt I administered to 2 of  Bishop Stokers children who were sick with the mountain fever we then returned to P.
