Evry thread &amp; tie that binds man to man has been broaken assunder (in consequence of receiveing the fulness  of the Gospel of Christ.) Men have left their  husbands children their parents &amp; parents their children (Brothers  their sisters &amp; sisters their Brothers in order to be gathered with the saints of God that they might partake of salvation). This people  have proven to the world by their acts that they have a knowledge of  the way of life &amp; salvation. This people have proven (to all men)  that they can sacrafize evry endearment (in this life) for (Eternal)   ENDENTRY  evry difficulty (which we are called to pass through) it is our duty  to make evry sacrafice that is required of us so that our Father  in heaven, the Holy Angels, &amp; all Just men who sit enthroned in glory power, &amp; dominion may look upon us in this capacity  is that they may see in their Kingdoms that we do prove to them that we are willing to make evry sacrafize ^if i may call it a sacrifize^ on Earth endearing to man in order that we may secure a seat with them in  Eternal light &amp; glory. (But not withstanding all the light &amp; knowledge we have of life &amp; salvation) do you not see how easy it is for us  to turn away to the right &amp; to the left &amp; say &amp; do many things which we afterwards regret &amp; wish we had not done is it not the case with us all more or less, it is. I see a thousand weakness in myself that I ^now^ regret and it is so with all those who have the light of the spirit of God they can see their weaknesses (&amp; regret them &amp; they will try to over come them I can not ownly see these things  in myself but I can see them in my brethren for when I learn myself &amp; Brigham I learn my brethren by this rule I know all of you) we give way to temptation and angry feelings against  our Brother &amp; want to be revenged on them. I ask is this a righteous feeling, No it is not, and yet we live day by day &amp;  week  People will be guilty of a little lying a little swareing a little deceiving &amp; a little stealing. do you think that you can repent of all your sins &amp; be forgiven in a moment. no you cannot, evry latter day  saint knows better, this would be sectarianism, the religion of the world is that a man may commit Murder &amp; when on the  gallows he can repent &amp; be forgiven &amp; go right straight to Abrah- ams bosom but this is fals doctrin it is not true. Some say that I cannot over come my passions when I am tempted &amp;  tried I cannot help giving way to my feelings I must  give vent to them and scold &amp; sometimes  I cannot help it. But I tell you that you can help it you have got to help it sometime or other or you cannot be saved you have got to begin to learn to over come, you should begin to im- prove day by day. Shun the errors as you see them and improve  upon them be better men &amp; women tomorrow than you are to day Continue to improve there is not a man or woman here  but what can do better here than they do. But says one  Brother Brigham says hard words. So I do use harsh  words.  hear me speak evil of my brethren. But I will reprove wickedness among the Human family. As your leader I will say let us try to improve our lives. Let us overcome ev temper and evil passion  your mouth and keep your tongue still and quiet, and the next time you are tempted you can overcome it easier. Keep   are cross &amp; attempt to correct your children conquer your- selves first. Fathers when you feel any of the evil passions  of your natures arise then you need the grace of God to help bring yourselves into subjection that you may go in the spirit of meekness untill you get the victory over your feelings. we  are liable to get out of the way we should not do wrong knowingly   ENDENTRY  to confess our faults, it would be a hard matter for me to confess that I had done wrong knowingly. You should be governed by righteousness. Let every Elder in Israel look upon his brethren  &amp; sisters like little children. when a person does a wrong in his foolish weekness look upon it as such. (we see the children of man laboring hard to obtain wealth they labour night &amp; day to obtain this object) but wealth will not give you wisdom, but  if you will shun evil and extend the hand of charity to evry living  being &amp; do good to all (as far as you have an opportunity) this will  grow in you &amp; you will increase (in wisdom &amp; knowledge) we  should live so as to enjoy the spirit of Revelation that we may know the will of God concerning us in all things. You should  not live for yourselves alone for if your Affections are not  placed on the Lord Jesus Christ and do not possess charity you will mis the gate (&amp; not enter into the glory of God yourselves) for you will not receive the spirit of the gospel, your hearts should be  empted of evry thing but the spirit of the gospel. (that you may be  filled with the spirit of Revelation that you may know the voice of the good shepherd for if this people was to loose the spirit  of revelation &amp; turn from righteousness they would be liable  to be led down to hell but while the people keep the spirit of God &amp; of Revelation with them they would know the voice of the good shepherd.) If I was to get out of the way  would not all that had the spirit of God see it, as they did Sidney  &amp; W on claimed to be the shepherd &amp; leader of this people the people knew not his voice. But when the true shepherd spoke unto  them they knew his voice and they followed him. It is the duty of this people &amp; their privilege to live in such a manner that  they cannot be deceived by any deceiver. It is your duty to  live your religion. No man can magnify the priesthood &amp; their  calling unless they live their religion, unless they are filled with the spirit of revelation, of the Holy Ghost, &amp; of the Holy Priesthood then they can magnify their calling and do their duty to their Neighbor &amp; to all men then their would be an end to Bishops &amp; High Councils trials. Parents are under the deepest obligation  to live their religion And the young men &amp; women also that when you get married your children may be begotten in Holiness &amp; born in Hol then you cannot make any thing but Saints of them. Begin  your work right Carry it on right. Bring up your children right then when they are old they will not depart from it.  This is the coven- ant which God made with Abraham that to his   He received this covenants from the Lord &amp; desired to see them fulfilled upon the Earth. Abraham was driven from his Father's house after  he  his Priesthood upon him by a man whose name was Melchisedek when Abraham received the Presthod the people were so wicked  that no man would receive him but the Lord promised him a seed through whom the Holy Priesthood should be perpetuated  forever and that to the increase of his seed there should be no end The Lord promised to Abraham this great blessing A man can  have no greater Blessing than was promised to him that He should   ENDENTRY  ask the Lord for any greater blessing than this for myself the  Lord Promised him that the various ordinances of his Kingdom  should be administered through his posterity forever where ever the kingdom of God existed. Then let evry child for the future  be begotten in Holiness and remember this one thing live your religion I now want to speak of another thing. A vary small portion of  our time was spent in the Nauvoo whare we began to ad- minister the ordinances according to the words of Malachi in the 4 5 coming of the great &amp; Dreadful day of the Lord." "And He shall turn  the Hearts of the Fathers to the children &amp; the hearts of the children to  their Fathers lest I come &amp; smite the Earth with a curse" Abram received the promise from the Lord that his seed should  be saved. And all the seed of Abraham in all the Gentile Nations or  among the uncontaminated of the house of Israel will be gathered That have si their covenants, or you would not see the children of these Mountains  in the degredation in which we now find them. The Lamanites upon  this continant are Manassehites almost exclusively, their is but  little of the seed of Ephraim among them, they are counted as  the seed of Abraham and they must be saved or they would  not have become so loathsome as they are, they are punished  in the flesh to make an attonement in the flesh for their  sins &amp; transgressions, and when they pass through the veil the  enemy has no power over them. In the day of the Lord Jesus Christ  all the particles of the Blood of Abraham will be gathered together  The seed of Abraham has not been counted for many years   to number them all when he had got the numbers together before  they could be computed there would be a great number more  born during the time of there numerration so they could not be  numbered &amp; this is the reason why his seed cannot be numbered Brethren &amp; sisters you are of the seed of Abraham &amp; you should live  your  This priesthood will turn the hearts of the children to the Ancient  Fathers &amp; the children to the Fathers now &amp; those which are to  come will be made perfect this chain must not broaken for  mankind cannot be saved any other way. This Priesthood must  be linked together so that all the children may be linked to Father  Adam. It may be asked when will this work be done, it will be  done in Temples in our day &amp; in the days of our children. we shall  go into the Temples &amp; be pillars therein &amp; go no more out &amp; we shall  plant trees &amp; vineyards &amp; eat the fruit thereof. I will call it the     good thing &amp; we will extend this influence from Zion untill  it roots out evry evil &amp; brings  our God. We will administer in the Temple which we have now  begun &amp; that is one point gained &amp; we will seal to men by the keys FIGURE of the Holy Priesthood this is the  highest ordinance it is the last ordinance of the Kingdom of God  on the earth and above all the endowments that can be  given you it is a finall sealing an Eternal Principle   ENDENTRY  when we return to Zion &amp; build the great Temple which Joseph  saw &amp; the centre of Zion is Esstablished the glory of God  will rest upon it by day &amp; by night &amp; those that are prepared  will see the face of the sun of man &amp; they will see Joseph &amp;  Hiram in the flesh in their resurrected bodies. Then will the  armies of Israel be terrible to all Nations then will one chase  a thousand &amp; two put ten thousand to Flight.    bly be one of those who hold the keys of this dispensation &amp; has  deliverd them to Joseph and you will see Jesus &amp; he will eat peaches  &amp; Apples with you but the world will not see it or know it for  wickedness will increase. Joseph &amp; Jesus will be there they will  walk &amp; talk with them at times &amp; no man mistrusts  are. Joseph will lead the Armies of Israel whether He is seen  or not, whether visible or invisible as seemeth him good Joseph has  got to receive the keys of the resurrection for you &amp; I. After he is  resurrected he will go &amp; Bresurrect Brother Brigham Brother Carloss, and when that is done then He will  say now go Brother Brigham &amp; resurrect your wives &amp; children &amp;  gather them together while this is done the wicked will know nothing  of it though they will be in our midst and they will be struck with  fear this is the way the resurrection will be all will not be raised at once  but it will continue in this way untill all the righteous are res- urrected. After Joseph comes to us in his resurrected body He will  more fully instruct us concerning the Baptism for the dead &amp; the sealing  ordinances. He will say be baptized for this man &amp; that man &amp; that  man be sealed to that man &amp; such a man to such a man, and  connect the Priesthood together. I tell you their will not be  much of this done untill Joseph comes. He is our spiritual Father  Our hearts are already turned to him and his to us. This  the Holy Priesthood and we shall continue to administer in the ordin- ances of the kingdom of God here on Earth. Joseph will not officiate  in this low capacity any more neither did Jesus after his Resur- rection if so he would have baptized Saul but he was exhalted above  the Earth and he told Saul to go to a certain man in a certain street  &amp; he would administer to him the ordinances upon the Earth. I say  to you dont hurry in the ordinances dont do what you ought  not it is not time to hurry we should not under take to do now  what we ought to do 50 years hence. what have we to do to day. Purify  your hearts that you may receive the manifestation of the spirit  of God. When you sow your wheat you prepare the ground then sow your wheat &amp; watch it untill the hearvest it is Just so in the  priesthood you will be just as busy as you can be to do the things  which are to be done to day. Now dont be in a hurry I say we are going  to have time enough. I say I will be on the Earth to do all I can. And after I die &amp; get my body again my resurrected body I mean to come  back to the Earth again and fight the Devils and be here at the winding up  scene I want to see righteousness prevail &amp; the saints have peace on the earth    Governor of this Territory.

He is selected to sit there   ENDENTRY  so it is with the congress &amp; the Governors of the several States and  I am here as one of them as the servant of the people. Congress has prepared a constitution for this Territory which they call  the organic act and have granted certain rights to this people as  a community. They have said this Territory should be organized  thus &amp; so with a Govornor &amp; Legislative Assembly and the  right is given to the people to select 26 Representatives &amp; 13  councellors Annually this body may enact Laws to controll each  of us &amp; all the inhabitants of this Territory including the governor  the Judges the Secretary the supreme coart the District court  &amp; the Probate court. they have said they shall have all the  power given to them by the Legislative assembly we have a Legislative  Assembly &amp; Magistrates courts congress will send certain men to hold supreme courts &amp; send other men as officers to the Territory  of Utah to transact business for the Territory of Utah so as to  make it as easy as possible. The United States Judges are not  here as Kings or Monarchs but as servants of the people  And when you see a Judge puting a city under Martial Law they  manifest Boyism &amp; you should pitty them &amp; give them a peace of  cake. If a man wants to be what he is not it is certain that He  wants to get out of his sphere. when some men know a  hundred words He thinks he knows all of webster some will try to study a hundred sciences of the day &amp; then know no  more than a child. when a person studies Divinity 5 years they are ownly fit to be put down upon the ground as a block  to stand upon to get upon your horses.

I tryed to bring myself to this scene &amp; fancied to myself how I would feel in Hearing the message of Glad tidings that a savior was born &amp; also in being associated with him in life then the sorrow of his being taken away &amp; crucified  then the great Joy in his resurrection &amp; his teachings while in his Immortal body. but when I think of the greater things which are to take place in our day I do not regret that I did not live in that day for there are greater things to come forth than was manifest in that day. For that kingdom of God of which all the prophets have spoken since the world began has now  come forth as a preparation for the second coming of Christ not coming to be born in a manger but He will   ENDENTRY  of which the prophets have spoken no are we preparing for th^i^se great Event now if a stranger was to come to us they would not suppose that we were preparing for this great Event but was merely cultivating the Earth to raise potatoes corn wheat &amp;c. I do not believe for a moment  that is the case for I do believe that this people are preparing for the Coming of Christ. what will take place at that time I have red in the book of mormon what that book says will take plase we can read the great things that are spoken in that Book. (He read some unto the people) I will take it to myself I  that Book as I should have been I have red many other books of late but not so much in the book of Mormon as formerly I have seen the time that I could read nearly whole Books in the book of Mormon without looking upon that book I am  trying to get all the sayings in the Books in my own mind  that are spoken concerning the signs of the times in the day  in which we live for I am well aware that it will over- take many as a thief in the night in the midst of the saints now let us look at the tokens or signs of the times that are passing before us as many as present themselves  to our minds. I will read a revelation given to P P Pratt &amp; others "Jesus Christ will not come in the form of  a woman nor like a man walking upon the face of the Earth. but look forth for the Heavens to be shaken &amp; the mountains to be laid low &amp;c. when shall thes things be when the Angel shall sound his trumpet two events will take place at the same time, also the Lord said the La- manites shall Blossom as the rose in the wilderness now  we know that this will not take place in a moment  for we know it will take some time to prepare the  Lamanites for this work it will require a great miracle to bring that people to that state or it will take some great changes to bring it about this is but  one of the Events that is to take place before the coming of Christ. I am glad to hear the account of the brethren who have gone among that people I am satisfied that  that people will not be prepared to receive the blessings of God untill they cultivate the Earth &amp; when this  shall Have accomplished the great work but ^not^ untill that   will be inspired to teach them. &amp; ther children and  all men will be blessed who labour faithfully to bring  them to this state of things. Jacob shall flourish in  the wilderness the Lamanites shall blossom as the rose we shall hear of Israel and of their prophets &amp; Revelations  in other parts of the Earth. I do not say that they will  have the priesthood from this people nor I do not  say they will not for there are other men who hold the FIGURE keys of the kingdom of God on the earth the Revela- tor &amp; the three Nephits hold the keys of the kingdom of God &amp; they will administer unto the children of men Zion shall flourish upon the Hills &amp; rejoice excedingly   ENDENTRY  there was no gathering at all Kirtland I have no idea that the prophet himself knew at that  time whare this would be. we are now here in the mountains in fulfillment of that Prophesy and  Revelation. Also in the 40 forting words were spoken concerning the Jews &amp; Jerrusalem they were to go to Jerrusalem for they had received double reward for all their sins now comfort them  &amp; in Jerrusalem in the days of the ^Birth of the^ Savior No they did not then that same John Had yet to do a great work in the  Earth in the last days who first delivered the priesthood  to Joseph Smith the prophet &amp; founder of the Church of  Christ in this dispensation it was this same John the  Baptist so he has fullfilled a part of his last day mis- sion.

W. Woodruff addressed the people &amp;  said that when I look upon the mountains &amp; vallies &amp; hills &amp;  dales &amp; both in the Heavens &amp; on Earth I behold a great  variety in all the works of God &amp; in looking upon the portr- ait of the Presidency &amp; Twelve I see no two men or things  look alike &amp; what constitutes a part of the glory of God  is the great variety of his works so in the preaching of the  Presidency &amp; Twelve each man might preach upon a different  subject &amp; Handle it in a different manner yet all by the  same spirit &amp; will edify the people. so I feel incouraged to think  that notwithstanding such a great flood of light &amp; truth  has been presented to this people since the commencement of this  conference that the Lord will still give me sumthing that may edify the people this evening. I would warn the people to give  heed to the strong teachings &amp; exertations which they have   ENDENTRY  give themselves to the studying of the revelations of God as con- tained in the Bible book of Mormon &amp; Doctrin &amp; Covenants    neglect the study of all other Revelations but this is not  so all men should follow &amp; harken to the living Oracles of  God but they should not neglect the study of the scriptures for  God has commanded it and any man that will search the  revelations of God thouroughly will be far better prepared  to carry out the council of the living oracles at all times    principle of recording the dealings of God with us here on  the Earth while all other prophets &amp; Apostles record the dealings  of God with them why should not the Elders of this last dispensation  it is true that the Prophet Joseph wrote the History of the church  in his day &amp; that testiment is now gladdening the harets hearts of  thousands while the testator is dead so with the Presidency  of the Church who are now leading us they keep a History  of the dealings of both God &amp; man with them the History of  which will be interesting to millions of future generations  but does this excuse the many thousands of Elders &amp; High  priest &amp; Apostles who have travelled for many years &amp; built  up this church &amp; kingdom &amp; had the gifts of the Holy Ghost  with them so they have had power to heal the sick &amp; cast  out devils open the eyes of the blind unstop the ears of the deaf  cause the lame to leap as an heart &amp; commanded the Elements  &amp; they obey them. &amp; have had guardian Angels to preserve  them from Danger &amp; Death I say shall the Elders be blessed  with these things &amp; not count them worth recording not  even make the mark of a pen to leave the Account on  record for their children &amp; future generations to read I say  they should. I think the Lord requires this at our hands  &amp; it is a Rich &amp; Holy legacy which is Justly due our posterity And I do desire that the Elders of this church would keep a  history &amp; Journal of their lives I also wish that our young  men would become acquainted with Phonography that we may  have one thousand reporters whare we have one now that  they may report the teachings of the servants of God &amp; the work  of God in this generation many other remarks I made to the  people concerning the gathering of Israel &amp; other subjects &amp; was  followed by Elder Orson Pratt the spirit &amp; power of God  rested us all during the conference I laid on hands upon a  sick woman with Brother Orson Pratt    ENDENTRY November 19, 1855 ~ Monday    Bishop Stokers children who were sick with the mountain fever we then returned to P.
