 September 19, 1836 ~ Monday      Sept 19th Is a day long to be remembered by me & others in Consequence of the interesting   scenes transpired with the Saints of God in the South. Isaiah & others of the Ancient   Prophets testify to us of the great events of the last days esspecially of the literal  gathering of Israel. They say the Saints shall gather from the East & from the   West & that the North shall give up and the South keep not back. This interesting   day had now arived yea the 19th of Sept 1836 when Some of the Saints of God in the   South began to take their families their Charriots Waggons, their Oxen, their Horses   their Tents their Armour and moove towards Zion as the children of Israel   according to the command of God As followsed Arose in the morning at Br Camps   & breakfas'ed at his house after which we reparded to the Bank of a stream whare   Prayers were offered up unto God when President Marsh led a young man into the   waters of Baptism & he was confirmed upon the bank of the stream under the   hands of Presidents Marsh, Patten, & Grooves then we all stood upon our feet &  receieved great Blessings confirmed upon our heads with uplifted hands of the   three above named Brethren President Marsh being speaker We then all took   the parting hand with these Beloved servents of God & with Sister Patten also   these four friends took their seat in a waggon & set their faces as a flint   towards Zion not waiting for those that on the same day ware to follow   their example but with Ox teams Soon after the above named Brethren left   us Br Albert Petty came to us from Cyprus Branch with his waggon & family  to join those of the Taropen Branch who ware going to Zion After spending a short   time in aranging the waggons & teems the company were Prepared to move forward the   company consisted of four ^4^ families with three Elders as follows

I immediately set before her the danger of returning to Babylon and encouraged her and she became reconciled and continued her journey.} I rode   with them this first Days travel as far as the South fork of Mayfield whare we all camped   for the night after pitching our tents & taking supper I assembled this small Camp of Israel   together at Br Albert Petty's tent to address them for the last time & after they were assembled   I arose to address them & although the rain desended in torrents so   that we were wet through a good tent yet my soul was vibrated & fired with   emotions & feeling of no ordinary nature I endeavord to lay before them the worth and   value of the cause they were ingaged in & that they were the first in fullfiling the   Prophets who spake of the South's giving up ^or keeping not back^ & that it would be recorded upon the  Archives of heaven to be read in the day of eternity that they were the first fruits of the   South who had spread their tents for Zion. I also instructed them about travling by   the way they all covenanted to give heed to Elder Boydstuns Preceps as they had chosen   him as their leader. When I closed I was followed By Elders Boydstun, Cathcart, & Clapp   who spake in the spirit of God & with feeling of the deepest interest When this   edifying interview closed by our kneeling & I addressed a throne of grace & implored  the mercy of God to rest upon the camp that they might all reach Zion in Peace {distance} 8 miles

Mr Palmer being a decided Deist his object in this work  was to overthrow the vailidty & testimony of the scriptures or Prophet & Apostles And after ende-  avouing to take the advantage by gathering together in one combined mass all the inconsistences, folies,  & eviles af a sectarian generation & heaping them upon the true Church of Christ When ther is no  more concord or connection between the two now than between the Pharasees, Sausees  Herodians, & Christ & the Apostles eighteen hundred years ago. He then says that the testimony  of Christ has failed & not fulfilled according to his word & for proof of his assertion he  voted the 24th Chapter of Math & says that in that Chapter Christ prophesied that the fall of  Jerusalem The Comeing of Christ & the end of the world Would take place in the gener  ation & he declares it did not take place & in consequence of this Mr Palmer makes the seceeping  conclusion that the Bible is fals & Jesus Christ an imposter But let Mr Palmer hold  untill that the Prophesy is fulfilled according to the declaration of Jesus Christ & all will be well  & the world will feel the power of natuers God See Page 100 [FIGURE] Preached at Col  Rowletts at candle light I followed Elder Smoot      November 6, 1836 ~ Sunday      6th Sunday Rode to William Smoot's Preached at his house distance of the day 7 miles      November 7, 1836 ~ Monday      7th Sold one Book of Mormon's & Rode to Owenton, Owen County, KY on the day of the   election to vote for President &c at first they endeavor'd to Deprive Elder Smoot & my  self from voting because we were strangers but after employing some Judges &  Col J.

O time how swift & how precious thou art.   How great the events that are bourn upon thy wings, esspecially in the dispensation of the fullness   of times. 1836 is gone it cannot be recalled. Europe hath began to tremble at thy departure. The   endowment of the Latter Day Saints hath bespake a God in Israel & is sufficient to show that   though the heavens & the earth Pass away the word of God spake through the Prophets must   all be fulfilled. It is true that the thought of man may now retrace his footsteps through   1836 that is Past. But who can tell whare the end of 1837 will leave him. Yea that important   year that is mounting the wheels of time to stand upon the stage of exhistance to do its   Perfect work. Will not its gigantic operations, & its magna works stand upon the Archieves of   heaven as great events. Will this gentile generation still sleep in this late hour if so sleep on   & take thy rest which is short for thy end is come & the day is broke that Israel must be awoke   from his slumber for the last time & Prepare himself for the Bridegroom then let   1837 finish its work with speed & let its departure say who is gone to the tomb. & what   Kingdom overturned & what Kingdom esstablished. Yea let 1837 Report (as it departs) that   Zion with her stakes indicates tha God will rule in her midst with Power Strength & Glory     
 January 3, 1837 ~ Tuesday      Jan. 3rd 1837 At early Candle light I repared to the house of the Lord in company with   Elder Milton Holm^e^s for the purpose of Meeting with the quorum of the Seventies.  President Aldrich opened the meeting by Prayer & after a few appropriate remarks   from President Coltrin about twenty of the third Seventy was ordained to the high   Priesthood & as members of the third Seventy ^{under the hands of the above named Presidents.}^ After this ordinance was Performed   Elder Holms & myself was called upon by the above named Presidents to come   foreward to be ordained as members of the first Seventy Elders of Israel to bear   the name of Jesus to the nations of the earth. The first Seventy was Chosen out   of the Camp that went up to Zion for the redemption of our brethren in the Spring of   1834. but as we were not present when they were chosen we were afterwards   chosen in the second Seventy but their now being two vacancies in the first we   were chosen to fill them. President Aldrich ordained Edder Holms to this appointment   & Pronounced great blessings upon his head. President Zebedee Coltrin Ordained   me as a member of the first Seventy & Pronounced great Blessings upon my head   by the spirit of Prophecy & Revelation Some of them I will mention which are as   follows THAT my enemies would confine me in prisions & chains & that I should rend   the prisions & chains in twain in the name of JESUS & that the Lord would give me  Great Power, Knowledge, & wisdom that I should heal the sick cause the blind to see  the lame to leap, the Deaf to hear, stop the mouths of Lions, rase the dead waft   myself from river to river from sea to sea & that I should stand before Kings &  Princes & that they would send for me to receieve wisdom, Knowledge, &   instruction at my mouth because they consider'd me wiser than they in like   manner as the Egyptians sought wisdom at the hand of JOSEPH And that     
 God would give me a multiplicity of blessings that I should Preach to the nations of the   Earth & the inhabitants upon the Islands of the sea & that I should then return   & stand upon Mount Zion in the flesh even in Jackson County Missouri at   the Cumming of Christ & that I should be cought up to meet him in the clouds   of heaven for he said thus was the word of God unto me & Also that I should   visit COLUB & Preach to the spirits in Prison & that I should bring forth  from the Terrestrial Kingdom all my Kinsman ^who had Died^ by Proclaiming the gospel  unto othem. These & many other Blessings were Pronounced upon my head  & further said that I should be annointed & my life sealed up & then  their would be still greater blessing Pronounced upon my head. I felt   much of the Power of God rest upon me in this ordinance & bear witness of   the truth of the above PROCLAMATION See May 29th 1836 in this Journal     
 VISION  I Willford Woodruff being in the spirit on the eve of the 2nd Day of Jany AD 1836 mine understanding  was enlightened and mine eyes were opened to look within the veil and behold the things that are to  come, things which must yet be fulfilled. an angel said unto me look and I looked and beheld great  and marvelous things that are to transpire spedily many in this generation. I saw a Judgment that  doth await Babylon the great. I saw signs in the east as a warning to the nations and to fullfull the  Prophets III X II [FIGURES]  I beheld the sun turn to darknes and the Moon to Blood and the horizon covered with burning  Cities as is to come upon Babylon I saw seven golden Lions sit in the heavens as burning  brass but the meaning was taken from me. I saw the resurrection of the Celestial Kingdom  or the inhabitants theroff whose glory was that of the first born they were arayed in white  garment of fine lining most beautiful & fair. I saw the resurrection of the Terrestrial Kingdom  whose glory was lesser than the Celestial. The earth hove from its capacious bed that Immor  -tality might rest upon them and they came forth out of their graces. Great peace, joy, happiness,  and glory immortality and Eternal Life reigned in the Celestial and Terrestrial Kingdoms  Great and marvelous were the things shown unto me while in the spirit I beheld a personage  appear in the Clouds of heaven and while looking at the greatness and majesty and the  story of these things the veil was closed from my view and I awoke and my rest was seel  unto me And if I cannot write all that I saw I testify that what I have written is true

My dear Brother: With pleasure I hand you herewith our financial  report for the past three months. You see we are able to keep our  head above water, and we have a very nice office to invite our  strangers in to see us, such as news paper reporters ect. Indeed  I am happy to say we have a very comfortable conference house.    I am prepared to receive our brethern as they come to  their fields of labor. We have about 120 Elders in this field and  it seems as though we could use that many more to a good advantage  Wehave only baptized upwards of 100 people since my time here, but  I think that is fairly good when we consider that nearly all of  our Elders are new in the field. Our Neophites, what we have are  good inteligent people, and we are educating them hiow to pay  tithing and live their religion.    I have been all through the field twice and have organized  Eleven Conferences. Our Elders are full of faith and determined  to do their duty. Part of them travel without money. Recently  while I was at Boston holding conference I met an old member of  our Church who was Baptized by Prest. Young and he has not seen  one of our Elders before for 45 Yrs. With love to your self and  Coworkers, I remain, with prayers for "Zion's" triumph,    Your brother,    A P Kesler    Very good letter.  J. F. S.

My dear Brother:    With much pleasure I hand you here-with our financial  report of this mission for the past quarter ending on this date.  Our efforts in this part of "Zion" asmissionaries seem to be al-  most with-out success, but still I do not feel to complain, as I  believe that god is with this workand if we are persistant and  prayerful we shall be led to the honest in heart.  Since my ar-  rival in this mission -six monthe ago- we have only baptized  Seventy persons; this is but a small number when compared with the  great multitude that yourself and Uncle Orson Pratt immersed  while you were in WEngland.    Our brethern here mostly travel without money, and  especially is this the case in the rural districts.  There seems  to be a slight spirit of investigation in the New England States  Our Elders have recently baptized a family in Main that Prest.  Cannon referred me to.  Some little intrest is manifest on Fox  Island and near Boston also.  Our Brethern are received very kind-  ly by the people in the West and south of Pa.    Ever praying for the welfare of our Church and soliciting  any suggestions that you may have to offer, I remain,  Your brother,    A.P. Kelser

 Wonder if Cousin Azmon really thought that your Father & Mother would go there in preferanc to Nauvoo. True he made them a very good  offer but I presume he did not expect they would accept it. Henry Woodford has frequently told me that Azmon was no better off as to property  than he was when he left Connecticut. I suppose he knows as well respecting his situation as any one of his friends    [sideways text] Do continue to intercide the Throne of Grace in behalf of my poor afflicted Mother & if you can get faith for her recovery do get it:  Mother generally rests tolerably well nights, & has quite an appetite this is what seems to keep her up—her nervous system is most exciteable I ever saw. My Brother is tolerably well. [end of sideways text]    Farmington June 28th 1845    Cousins Wilford & Phebe    While enjoying the pleasure of a visit with your dear  parents in Farmington, in company with my Mother & being favored with more  leisure time than has been my privilege for a long season, I thought I would improve a  few moments in addressing a few lines to you. I have not ^much^ of interest to communicate  but I wish to acknowledge the receipt of your letter and some papers, (the "Star," which were  gratefully received.) as also to give you some information respecting Mother's present of  state health &c. It gave us all pleasure to learn that you were still in the enjoyment  of good health & spirits & that so good a degree of prosparity attended your labors in the ministry  and we will ever esteem it a privilege to hear from you by letter & know of your prosprty  both in temporal, & spiritual things, & I doubt not but you feel equally desirious to know  concerning the welfare of your kindred & friends in this land. Your Mother has nearly  completed a letter to you in which she will give an account of herself & family & things apper  taining to them & I will inform you a little respecting our family &co. There has been no very  material change with mother since I wrote, nor since you visited us last fall. I have however  considered her rather on the decline, indeed I know that her health in general is has not  been near as good as it was last summer. Her situation has been such for a long time that  that it has often appeared to me that we must all perish together for the want of strength to endure    Not long since we came to the conclusion that somthing must be done, some new measure  adopted, & we finally decided to procure some good place & hire Mother boarded a short season  we accordingly engaged a place, but when the time arrived for her to go she was determined  against it & manifested feelings of such a kind that we could not, neither would we urge her,  but thought we might adopt some better plan or at least more congelial to her feelings.    It was next proposed that I should accompany her on a visit to Farmington, & we finally  succeeded in that thing. We hired a horse & chaise, rode very slow, made a number of calls  but when we arrived here, she was quite fatigued, more so I presume on account of  her being lo[a]th[e] to come & worrying all the way about it. What effect this visit will have 
 July 3    upon her I am not able to say. One week has now expired since we came here &  I cannot say that I think she is any better though not quite as noisy, yet she is beginning  to worry and tease in the usual strain, even now she is in a panic while I am stealing  a moment to write in my chamber, I had not thought it would be so when I comm-  enced these lines but I find she will not allow me to be out of her sight a moment  and might as well attempt to read or write in Bedlam as with her. I must now quit  but will give a little further account by & by.    I find Aunt Woodruff's letter abut ready for Mailing & as I intend enclosing  this in her sheet I must hasten its completion, & omit any further particulars  respecting Mother. You will ^be^ able to discover that she is about the same as  when you left. As it regards my own health it still remains quite poor as is the  case with Sister Ann's, but by the goodness & mercy of God we have been ennabled to  keep about & take ^care^ of our poor afflicted Mother—notwithstanding we often feel that  we must sink beneath the weight of our afflictions.    Since I came here I have been informed respecting Uncle Ozem & family, they are  all in comfortable health excepting Francis, he has been confined a long time with  a lingering disease & it is thought by his physicians that he will not recover—  none of them have visited Farmington since you were here. I long to see them  but cannot have the privilege. I shall expect to return home in the course of 2 or 3 days  if my Brother can make it convenient to come after us. I would like to make a longer  visit, but I fear that we should be burdensome. Aunt Bulah has finally made us a visit  for the first time since you left & is enjoying comfortable health, she has be^e^n very poor  during the winter & spring—but is now quite well. Please write as often as you can. It truly  does our souls good to hear from absent friends especially while under deep affliction. I have  somtimes thought we were almost forgotten because far away. Cousin Webster has never written  us & I do wonder very much as we have always been so good friends. You would be more excuseable  because of your many responsibilities, but I think it must be the want of a disposition in them.    I must close by wishing you health peace & prosperity. Your Cousin  Betsey.    The prophet is to be discontinued a short season if they can get few hundred additional subscribers it will again make its appearance.    Betsey Cossett  Farmington June 28 1845    [sideways text]  Your parents appear  to enjoy themselves exc-  cedingly well. I do  really think they have  a delightful situation,  their house much  better & more conven-  ient than the one they  formerly occupied.  Your Father appears  to be rather failing, he  has some po[o]r turns  but still does provide  all the comforts of life  & has assisted Cousin  Dwight & Eunice  considerable.    I have neither seen nor  heard anything from  Br. Sparks since I wrote  you. Br. Burnham  from Windsor who ac-  companied him to  our house last  winter has been  to weatogue once or  twice as I have been  informed but did  not call upon us. I  wonder much, he is  married & I think it  must be to some one  in Weatogue, a law-  yer in that place said  to my Brother the other  day Mr B. has been ^here^ of  late, he is married.  I says, to whom: he  replied ^to^ a lady just  below here. I think  it must be Jerry Enos  daughter of that place  I am not acquainted  with the family but  have understood that  they were friendly &  freely entertained those  Brethren when they  preached there  I hope it is the case [end of sideways text] 
 Nauvoo, May 8, 1845    Elder Wilford Woodruff    Beloved Brother    Yours of the 1st ult. post marked the 4th, was received  yesterday, also one from Elder Hedlock containing a schedule of the business and  situation of the office, 36 Chapel Street, also one from Wm and Charles Miller  of Manchester, ^to B. Young^ all of which We propose briefly to answer on this sheet to save time, for  We are somewhat busy with a variety of matters.    We rejoice at the cheering intelligence you communicate concerning the  work of the Lord in the Old World, and pray unceasingly for your prosperity, and  are satisfied with your printing, and securing the Copy right of the book of Doctrines  and Covenants, and if it is possible for you, it is wisdom also to forestall our—  enemies in France, and Germany; and secure the copy right in those ^or any other^ countries, and  also the Book of Mormon, in the name of Brigham Young, President of the Church  of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.    We are satisfied with Elder Hedlock's proceedings, and have been satisfied, and  doubt not he has done the best he could; You intimate that you think it not  best "to send any more poor, gratis." It is more than a year since, we notified Elder  Hedlock to send us more Emigrants at our expence. And it was one of the  positive instructions given to yourself, before your departure from Nauvoo, to send  no man, woman, or child to America at the expense of the office, and we trust  that this last repetition of these instructions, at the 11th hour, will suffice. If any  one has paid Pratt or Fielding, or Clark, or any body else, Let that body furnish  the passage according to contract.    We are glad if Elder Ward has made enough by printing to sustain himself,  and that he is ready to co-operate with you in all things: If he were disposed to claim  the continuance of the privilege of printing, on account of the licence given him by Elder  Pratt; all queries might be easily solved, by the simple question. Who gave Elder  Pratt the privilege of printing in England? Yourself or any one acquainted with  the circumstances can solve this problem.    William Miller in his letter, wished me ^(B. Young)^ to do him "the favor to hand over  £5 which I have, of his, to his brother Thomas Miller at sight." In reply I can truly  say, I have no recollection of any £5 of his, or any other amount in my hands, which  he will probably understand if he will think a moment. William Miller sent £5  to Elder Kimball to purchase a piece of Land. And Elder Kimball purchased the land— 
 according to his request; and at a subsequent period, Elder Kimball gave Thomas  Miller one sovereign or more on William's account, but the Land is here yet, and if   William Miller wants the money for it, he had better authorize Elder Kimball or any  one he chooses, to sell it for him, the money can then be forwarded to William or  given to Thomas if he can be found. The last news from him, we heard he was at  St Louis. Brother Charles Miller's writing, breathes the Spirit of the Gospel, we have  not time to answer them now. please inform them as above.    ^Sent a copy of   the above to Wm Miller^    Should Greenhow, or any of Rigdon's satellites arrive in your midst; you can  by anonymous communication, through the Post office, inform the police, how Rigdon,  their leader, declared on the public stand at Nauvoo, "that he held the keys of  conquest, and that he would conquer England, and take little Vic by the nose,  and lead her out of her palace &c &c" as you heard it, and brother Clark also.  this will be sufficient to cause him to be closely watched by police in citizens  dress, and if he does not keep himself pretty strait, the proper authorities will  attend to his case.    ^[FIGURE]^ It is a part of our religion, to support any government, wherever we  may be, that will protect us in common with other citizens, for to this end governments  are instituted. And as England has ever been true and faithful to us as a  people, in common with others: The Elders cannot be too particular to enjoin  on all Saints, to yield obedience to the laws, and respect every man in his office.  Letting politics, entirely, totally  and absolutely alone, and preach the first—  principles of the gospel of salvation, for to this end were they ordained and  sent forth. ^[FIGURE]^    We are for peace, we want no contention with any person or government,  and should war commence between England and America &c &c It will probably  be wisdom, for you, and all the American Elders, to return immediately home, and  leave all parties to fight their own battles. ^[FIGURE]^    Some of the caps are placed on the pilasters of the Temple, and all will  be completed in 3 or 4 weeks, with our usual prosperity. The stone are in rapid  progress, for the new font. The wall for the foundation of the pickets, or railing,  around the Temple Block, and the block west of the Temple (to be in one) is also  commenced. The brick are making for the Nauvoo House—140,000 feet of pine  lumber were received last Saturday, for our public buildings; another raft is expected  soon, and we anticipate they will all be enclosed early in the fall. The arsenal is  rising on the first story above the basement. Emigration has been greater than usual 
 this season, means are more plenty: and if you succeed in your joint stock  company, as you anticipate; a world of business may be done here next season;  should ^that^ perfect peace, and union continue, which now prevails. Rigdonism  has run its race in this country. It appears quite harmless when let alone,  we have heard of but one they have baptized in America as yet, and that was  an old apostate, and all that Rigdon has gathered out of the Church, are of no  account, they have ever been doubtful at the best, no honest man can be  deceived by such foolish sophistry and lies. We have killed it, by letting it  alone. Brother Webster is lame, but out. Sister Webster is better than when  you left, "Little Willie" was at Dr Richards last week, bright as a dollar. It is  a time of health in the "City of Joseph." The circuit court sits week after next.  The mob are preparing to try to raise an excitement of some kind, we dont know  what, but confidently hope and believe they will have little power over us. In God,   is our hope. We have little praying circles frequently, and your request has been  attended to.    Elder Reuben Hedlock will make a safe, judicious, and trustworthy  agent for the English Joint Stock Co, and we recommend him to the Stock hold[ers] [wax seal]  for that purpose.    We forward you with this, in a package a letter of Attorney, constituting  you an agent to transact all necessary business for the Church in the  United Kingdom of Great Britain, and on the continent of Europe.    Wishing you every blessing, we subscribe ourselves, your brethren  in Christ    Brigham Young President—    Willard Richards Clerk—    N.B. We have it might be very agreeable to the feelings   of the English brethren to furnish a bell for the Temple. If this  is their pleasure, you can forward it the first conveyance & we  will have it hung as the building is going up. We are  but little acquainted with the weight of bells, we have   thought of 2000 pounds, but we leave this to your judgment  we want one that can be heard night or day. If the duties  on such castings are too high, you will act accordingly to give us notice. B. Y.  W. R.

 W. Woodruff wished to express his feelings. I consider it to be my duty to bear in a  few words my test[imony] this da[y]—while I have heard the remarks of my brother this morn[ing]  this is what Jesus s[ai]d anciently can not ye discern the signs of the times [##Matthew 16:3##] - if [yo]u cannot  it it is bec[ause] they walk in darkness - it [h]as sometimes been a mystery how the L D S  have been gov[erned] ^?^ - even when the P[rophet] was living - when they [h]av[e] taken awa[y] your chu[rch]? tell us  why they heed your counsel - it is not bec[ause] the P[rophet]. S[eer]. & R[evelator] was here [againd] by a Rod of Iron 
 W. Woodruff--rejoice. & feel happy to see so many of the Saints together, who can enjoy the Blessing among us but the   Saints. Now I must Bring into My Store House your tythes & offerings. & see if I will not Pour out   a Blessing in Building a Temple unto God why I thought Looking on this Vast Congregation   if they only Pd their tything how different with the appearance of things be in one year  why the Elders that you Sent forth from this place, they were full of the fire of the   Lord and we felt it. when they came among us in the East I hope that the   Building of the Seventie Hall will go on Worthy of this Great People, and the temple  of the Lord progress rapidly among us. 
 but bec[ause] they [h]av[e] [h]ad a deg[ree] of that li[gh]t & bec[ause] they have seen the hand of God – here  again we [h]av[e] only one dissenting voice – it is bec[ause] they see the Ke[y]s of the K[ingdom] – the  devil [h]as [h]ad [h]is da[y] & [h]ad [h]is dominion – the Ld now agn makes bare his arm  & restores the P[riesthood] of the order of Melchizedek & Aaron & r called to bear off the K[ingdom]. – so man   shall glory in His presence – Moses s[ai]d wh an I that I sh[oul]d be called to lead the p[eo]pl[e] [##Exodus 3:11##]  the Ld God hath called men from the plow &c to round up their shoulders & in the  name of the Ld God they r able & will carry it off & God will fulfil his promises  I test[ify] that this work is of God & whil[e] I see the arm of God made bare & when I see  the d[e]v[i]l trying to lead away the chil[dren] of men – men look upon the wrong side of the  qu & the 1st thing they see is they [a]r[e] gone they [a]r[e] on the brink of destrcn – an I see men  turn to the rit & the left & I know that they r as the wa[y] to damnation when I see Shayism &   every other ism that is broken off from the prin[ciples] of truth, they go the way that os av done,  & they will feel it & theyre is no or plan of Saln—I warn all men be careful of what  wav for I tell you that as the Lord God lives the Sword is ab[ou]t to fall on the fall ^South^ they  [h]av[e] got to foot the bill & that is the reason why they [a]r[e] driving away the LDS that  they may be hidden up – unite with the p[eo]pl[e] that God [h]as chosen – it matters not  who it is Moses or Joseph I leave the consequence with God who is able to alld to his arm  [his] hand will go with his people while those who oppress this p[eo]pl[e] shall be oppressed  with what measure they mete shall be measured again. Why is all the South in arms ags  the LDS bec[ause] they [a]r[e] stirred up by the devil – the hearts of men [a]r[e] moved upon lest  the Saints should rule – the Ld is now going to work to set up his work & will accomplish it—even  I see America covered with cities, & begin to drive the Sts & shed their blood & refuse the cries of the  p[eo]pl[e] that [a]r[e] offered up to them – the die is casts their doom is sealed & the LDS [a]r[e] not the only  p[eo]pl[e] that will suffer by a p[eo]pl[e] who profess Christianity—I ask it will they escape judg-  & escape their reward. I had rather fall in the mire & find a grave in the [wind] of beans 
 & said: I feel to withdraw my cit[izenship] from the nation I wod never manifest my  feelings in the [nation] – I will never vote for a P[rophet] as a [lyarv]? or any on. tarry not  the judgts [a]r[e] sure – the heavens [a]r[e] full of them & as the Ld God lives they will be  poured out on this nation – bear it patiently – J. C. came – the Jews rejected their  princ[e] & crucd him – if they [a]r[e] exalted they [h]av[e] got to be exalted by the same Keys  that they have trodden under foot – altho they [h]av[e] killed Joseph Smith – they will  have something more to do with him, he will [h]av[e] something to do he will stand there &  judge that p[eo]pl[e] he will judge Carthage – Tho he is d[ea]d he lives – he is our  Senator there he is our Rep. there – it is time that the pra[ye]rs of the LDS shd  not be offd to this [nation] lest that place where there cries will be heard. let not  your heart faint – the greater your trial & affln &c the greater will be your  exaltn – & bless this p[eo]pl[e] 
 Elder Wilford Woodruff said he wished to bear testimony  to what had been said and to say he considered the Company  who were going with hand carts ought to call on the great  and the learned the high as well as low & the Time had gone  by when Elders had to go in at the back door and preach  in the out houses and back houses, but he considered they were   qualified to go in at the front door, and to preach in the  most respectable places & churches wherever they went. he considered  that they were going to bind up the law and seal up the  Testimony to a portion of the Lords vineyard, and if they  went faithful & were right in the sight of the Lord their  testimony would be followed by the power of God related an  instance of his going to Fox islands and going right to the Deacon  of the congregation and telling him he had a message from the Lord  and went in and baptized every man that owned a dollar in that  church.

 Anthy Lund live is apt to grow & morning  Man is growing,    W Woodruff, Melord in duality with this  people began as with little children. At first you  could not get a man to go five miles only he first went  to bro Joseph, inquire of it to the will of the Lord, But  so now they are called to go to the Nations. Isles of the   the Sandwich Isles, & they go without asking bro B to get  a revelation about it. The people therefore on the   [advice] they are improving. If this is an important  era in the K of G, & I am glad that the words sent to  the house of Israel, to esteem this the greater  priviledge to go to on a mission to them rather than to  the nations that have shed the the blood of the Prophets.  If we have the spirit of this I shall understand the  signs of the times & want to go to Cala. The judgment  of this I am going to visit the Earth, he will plead with   them with the sound, with famine & pestilence, & he will  send messengers to them that cannot rebuke, they will  fulfil their mission. The spirit has been deemed a burden  while [ashort] realized that [dont] grown here has been sent  as much as the mannaa was to the C of I, I have no  fears for the saints of the Lord if we are faithful & seek his  spirit. All the improvements & blessings the world has received  has been given by inspiration of the Lord, & they do not acknow  ledge his hand & He is angry with them. So they the acknowledge  his hand & we shall be blessed. It is wonderful to see this  manifestation of his power this people have received you cant  point out another place where there are as may helping as there  are here. We have evil in our midst but the majority are  trying to do right, & we are not [andested] in ^our understanding of the^one would of Delight  Lord.    I am glad to be here to see your place faces to be traveling  south, with them Co. You have not the privilege of meeting  with the Presidency every sunday but you can have the  Lord with your, and his spirit among you
