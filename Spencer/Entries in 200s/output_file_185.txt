After we left Monterey we passed through a piece of woods where the Methodists hold their  camp meetings, and the frames of their canvas  houses stood ready to be occupied when the  summer-time should come again. We got back to the salt water swimming baths at half past eleven. Mr Badlam informed us that the ocean water is  rather too cold, as a general thing, for bathing. It  comes down along the coast from the Arctic Regions This bath-house, which has been arranged by the  Southern Pacific Co. is an elegant place for bathing.  There are three large plunge baths under the one  roof divided by partitions. One compartment con- tains cold sea water, the next to it, water a little warmer,  and the next to that, water still warmer. The bather  can take his choice. The baths are surrounded by seats,  flowering shrubs, and various adornments, and  is beautifully lighted. There are private rooms where the  bathers undress, and bathing dresses are furnished them. Both sexes indulge in these baths, and we were told that  there are ladies who perform astonishing feats as divers  and swimmers, who frequently are seen in the baths.  Our carriage came for us. We returned to the hotel and at one o'clock took lunch, and from there went to the  station to meet the train at two o'clock to carry us back to San Francisco. Everything that wealth can command to make  this place that we visited charming and attractive had been   ENDENTRY WILFORD, WOODRUFF'S JOURNAL FOR 1886   ENDENTRY April 18th 1889 furnished. The spirit of Babylon rests in such places. The people who frequent this hotel value each other, ap- parently, by their wealth. Everything is gazed at and  measured according to the observer's idea as to their position  in life. We saw nature in her most beautiful aspects. We  saw places that made one thingk of Eden. Pride of life was  there. The love of the world; the lust for the things of the  world were there, but the love of God, reverence for Him  and His laws and His righteousness we did not see.

Brother Cannon laid his hands upon my  head and administered in prayer. I received  much benifit therefrom, as well as a cup of tea which  I drank. After dinner we took stage for 16 miles  to the Geysers. There were four horses on the stage and twelve passengers and the driver. The road is  a canyon road, and in places is very dangerous.

The scenery  was very grand, the mountains covered with vurdure  and timber, and beautiful spots occuring from time to  time. Mr Badlam is one of the liveliest and most witty of men, full of fun and anecdote and quite intelligent.  His friend Mr Swan is still more so. A capital story- teller, an excillent imitator of dialects, a wonderful  punster and capable of imitating every animal, he  furnished us constant amusement.

The rest of the party started up  the opposite ^side^ of the mountain, and examined all  the geyser springs, which were very interesting.  Steam issued from crevices from the sides of the mountain to a great extent, other places boiling  water came forth, and in other places there were pools  when the water boiled with violence, as it would in a  pot over a very hot fire. I leaned upon the arm of  Brother Wilcken who aided me greatly by assisting me up the mountain. It gave Brother Wilcken a  good sweating to do so. We descended by another path,  which was much easier than the one we climbed. It is remarkable that all these geyser springs are  all on the one side of the creek. We spent the day  very quietly. Mr Badlam and Mr Swan returned  with about a hundred trout, which they had caught in time for dinner, which we ate about six oclock. Before dinner, Bro. Cannon and Bro.

There were two vehicles, in one of  which one of Bro Badlams  daughter Maud and myself rode in one. We rode about  ten miles up the canyon, passing some very beautiful spots. Two or three places there were very fine water  falls. It was a dangerous journey in some respects From the summitt we had a very extended view.  On clear days the driver said he could see the ocean.  Our descent was rapid, and we passed through  a beautiful country, reaching Calistoga a little  before one o'clock. This place was at one time con- sidered a very fine watering place. Samuel  Brannan is said to have spent about half a million of dollars to make this an attractive place,  but it is now a place of no particular note. After  dinner at the hotel we took train for Benecia. At  Benecia we took steamer across some water to  reach the train for Oakland, and at Oakland we crossed the bay by steam ferry to San Francisco,  where we reached at about 7 in the evening.

This company have 1000 acres of ground laid  off into salt beds which are filled with water from the  Salt Lake. They extract the soda and mangnesia from the salt by drainage. They have a large building in which  is machinery run by an engine, for bringing in the  salt from the dump outside, grinding it, drying  again grinding it fine, sacking, or carrying to the Railway cars where it is loaded in sacks or in bulk. They make an excellent article of fine table salt  99 2/10 % pure. The water from the Lake is brought in  a canal some 400 yards long and is pumped by a  centrifugal pump 15 or 16 feet high in a quantity to  cover 100 acres 1 inch deep in 10 hours. They have a capacity of grinding and sacking 50 tons of salt per day, and have several 100 tons now on hand. It is no  doubt a grand enterprise.
