It  comes down along the coast from the Arctic Regions This bath-house, which has been arranged by the  Southern Pacific Co. is an elegant place for bathing.  There are three large plunge baths under the one  roof divided by partitions. One compartment con- tains cold sea water, the next to it, water a little warmer,  and the next to that, water still warmer. The bather  can take his choice. The baths are surrounded by seats,  flowering shrubs, and various adornments, and  is beautifully lighted. There are private rooms where the  bathers undress, and bathing dresses are furnished them. Both sexes indulge in these baths, and we were told that  there are ladies who perform astonishing feats as divers  and swimmers, who frequently are seen in the baths.  Our carriage came for us. We returned to the hotel and at one o'clock took lunch, and from there went to the  station to meet the train at two o'clock to carry us back to San Francisco.
