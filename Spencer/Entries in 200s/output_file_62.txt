Dear Brother:  Last July I promiced to take a mission to the Southern States on or before July next. The principal reason that I asked for a year was to cure myself of a secret disease, spermatorreah. The cause of the di- seas was, I think, the discontinueation of work and going to school.  I still have it, not bad, but worse than I feel safe with. I am strong, active and hearty. Sound in mind and body I think. I am twenty-four years old and unmarried.  I hated to speak of this, but thought it  necessary. I would not like for the people of town to know it. I have consulted a doctor.  I am now at your disposal.
