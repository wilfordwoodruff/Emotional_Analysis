 my financial embarrassments.  I feel in duty bound, notwithstand-  ing the dreads, fears, and many  weaknesses of the "flesh," to cheerfully  respond.    If all continues to prosper in  the direction of my preparation,  I have "faith" that my "family" will  be left agreeably comfortable, and  "finances" satisfactorily arranged.

 TO THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES,  GREETING.    THERE IS NOW READY FOR DELIVERY,  COLONEL RALPH DE CLAIRMONT'S  GREAT BOOK    REFORM,    An Essay on the Political, Financial and Social Condition of the  United States, showing Dangers, Defects  and Remedies.    Bound in cloth, gilt lettering, price $1.25. Copyrighted.    The book embraces the following important matter: Preface. Chapter I.  Caveat Patria: II. Law and Justice; III. Legislation; IV. Press; V. Religion;  VI. Education; VII. Finance; VIII. Federal Government; IX. United States  Army. Appendix: Constitution of the United States: Constitution of the Swiss  Confederation.    The various subjects contained in this book are treated in an entirely impartial manner, from  an independent and lofty standpoint, free from all bias and party spirit. The author has only the  welfare of the United States in general and that of the people at heart.  The book is written in a bold and fearless style, pointing out all the dangers and evils of the  present period and of the future, at the same time indicating the corresponding remedies. The style  of the book, though frequently sarcastical and full of indignation at the most flagrant abuses, is chaste  and may be read by all, old and young, for their benefit and instruction; it is easy to comprehend  by all classes of our people, from the merchant prince to the humble laborer.    The last chapter, highly eulogistic of and recommending an increase of the United States Army  to fifty thousand men, besides advocating other important changes and improvements in the service,  will be of the highest interest to the Officers of the Army.  They will find among other interesting  topics an account of the model organization of the army of Switzerland and reference to other  European systems.    The author begs to refer to the following flattering endorsement of his book by one of the  principal staff officers of the U.S. Army:    San Francisco, October 11, 1894.    "I commend to my brother officers and the public generally Colonel Ralph de Clairmont's book on  the POLITICAL, FINANCIAL AND SOCIAL CONDITION OF THE UNITED STATES. It is a trenchant  and vigorous essay on the times by an author of wide learning, extensive and accurate knowledge of history,  vast experience in our national and in foreign affairs, and, above all, keen insight into the events of the  day. It is a spicy survey of the existing conditions of our country, and wholly worthy of attentive perusal  and study. And while it touches upon vital questions, it yet carries the reader along as delightfully as  any sensible romance. It gives me sincere pleasure to heartily commend the work to others."    The first edition is nearly all disposed of. In order to secure a copy of this great book, please  send your order by bearer, or by postal card, to R. de Clairmont, No. 6 Eddy Street, San Francisco,  Cal., and it will be promptly forwarded to you upon payment of $1.25.

 REFORM.—Colonel Ralph de Clairmont,  a master of languages, a traveler and  writer, who for many years has been a  resident of this city, has just issued a book  of over 260 pages, which is an essay on the  political, financial and social condition of  the United States. The essay is bold and  it points to dangers and defects and sug-  gest remedies for existing evils. The  writer, who has devoted to the subject of  his book a great deal of close attention,  and has studied it from every point of  view. gives his impression in plain but  comprehensive language in different chap-  ters which treat of caveat patria, law and  justice, legislation, the press, education,  religion, finance, the Federal Government  and the United States army. He dwells  upon the various abuses that he has en-  countered in the pursuit of his subject and  for each has a suggestion for a correction  of the same. With a view to compariosn,  the author presents the constitution of  the United States together with the one of  the Republic of Switzerland. The latter  is based on that of the United STates. In  it are lacking features which the Moun-  tain Republic has, after many years of  careful watching, concluded could be  omitted and for which it has substituted  others which are deemed superior. In the  chapter on the army there are many valu-  able suggestions. [San Francisco: Pub-  lished for the author.]

 16 Wellesley Road  Croydon  England  Tuesday Dec 17 [18]94    Honored Sir  I am advocating   the legalization, and return   to the practice of polygamy   in this country.  My argument   shortly is: that the present   practice of Monogamy depreciates  the estimation of woman, leads   to improvident marriages and   the disastrous fecundity of the   lower classes and of the labourers,   so lowering wages and producing  poverty and vice.    The most serious objection to the   practice, here, seems to be

Phillips who has been  called to the southern states; the time appointed for him to leave is  October nesxt. He has been up to see me and explained his circumstances  which are as follows: He has a wife and two schildren and is in possess  ion of a small home ^on^ which he has just succeeeded in clearing off the  debt. We are not able to give him constant work, and he is employed  probably 8 months out of 12, and he says that he has not means at  present; but as the sugar campaign is about commencing, with economy  he could save a little money and be prepared to go on his mission  April next. As this ward like all other wards just now, is heavily  taxed to meet all demands on it, if it m^e^ets with your approbation,  I should certainly reccommend that he be realesed until then.

Dear Sir—    Will you please to  send me your autograph on   the enclosed slips at your con-  vience. would it be asking   you too much if you could   give me the name of three  or four books on the history,   etc. of the Mormons. Was there   ever a book written in the per-  sonal history- of Joseph Smith   and Brigham Young? Thanking   you for your kindness,    I remain  very truly yours  Edwin H Frost 
 HUGH S. GOWANS,  Attorney at Law.    Tooele City, July, 11, 1895.    Pres. Wilford Woodruff,  Salt Lake City.    Dear brother:    On the 9th. of this month I received a letter signed  by your name stating that I had been named   and accepted as a missionary to the Southern States  and to be ready to start by the 24th. of August 1895.  Now in regard to going; I am perfectly willing and   desire to go on my mission, but would like if   possible to have a little more time to prepare, as I   hardly think I can be ready by the time stated in   your letter, and if you can let me off until about   October I would be very much pleased, but I am   willing to do as you say.    Respectfully   Your brother in the Gospel  Alonzo Gowans.    [sideways text] Alonzo Gowans  July 11 [18]95. [end of sideways text]

 Steamer Buenavista Feby 5th 1850    Elder Woodruff    Dear Sir I presume you have learned sometime since  of the diversified appointments of the Elders who came from the valley this winter  & all other general intelligence from the valley of our homes, which if you have  not you will obtain of br G. B. Wallace. Brothers Gates, Higbee, Johnson, Lebaron  Young & Smith are on board with me. Some 3 or 4 of them are unwell & myself  also but we think we are recovering slowly. I sincerely hope you & your family   are enjoying good health and I feel to congratulate you upon your release from that  field of labor; for I feel as if I would prefer almost any othee nation on the earth to the  United States as a field of labor.    My particular object in writing you at this time is to make request of you concerning  a young sister Lucy Fox who came over with Littlefield Day & others to N. York her  mother did not know the spirits they were of or she would not have let her come with them  Her oldest sister Charlotte Fox is in the valley & a member of my family, she feels  very anxious about Lucy lest she may have fallen into the society of such as would lead her  astray & bring a lasting reproach upon her character. She thinks of Lucy with many tears.    Would you be so kind br Woodruff as to ascertain how it is with her and if  you could get her a place with a family wanting help, that for her services would bring her  with them to the valley, she could serve them till it was sufficient, till they were satisfied; you  would be doing good perhaps saving a soul from death & I should feel myself under lasting  obligation to you and be most happy to reciprocate your kindness in any way which  opportunity might present. The family all belong to the church & were of excellent moral  character which I hope still is the case. Be so kind as write me at all events to the  Star Office Liverpool as soon as you are prepared to give me what information you may  obtain about Lucy's situation, & chances of going west. Please also give me something of  your prospects at gleaning Grapes after the Vintage is done, & any thing you may feel to  bestow I shall be happy to receive; iIt has been sometime since we had communion with each other.    With many good wishes to yourself & family I subscribe myself Y[ou]r fellow Servant    F. D. Richards

Dear Brother:    I am in receipt of  your letter of the 20 Inst. wherein you  wish to know my feelings in regard  to performing a mission at Samoa.    I am here taking care of  one of my Fathers wives who has no  children and is getting old and very poorly  in health.    I have just got married  and have not got a house built yet.  Were I to take in consideration my  circumstances it would seem  impossible for me to leave.    I cant see where I can raise the  money unless I can sell my team  and wagon which I am willing to do.

 Honeyville, Box Elder County, Utah.  July 25th, 1894.    President W. Woodruff,    Dear Brother:—    I am informed that Bro. David  Loveland, of Honeyville, is to go on a mission to the Southern States in  the month of September. And I felt it my duty as presiding elder of that  ward to inform you of his financial situation.    I signed the letter which he wrote to you some time ago,  but having only just been called there to preside, his financial situation  was misrepresented to me by himself and I thought it my duty to inform  you how he is situated at the present time.    He has quite a large family to support and they have  nothing to depend upon only what he earns by laboring for other people by  days' work having scarcely any land of his own, and he is in debt about  $200.00 for the house and land where he resides at the present time and  I know that his family is quite destitute at the present time both for  food and clothing, and I realize his wife would not be able to send him  any means during his absence from home. And having found out his true  situation I felt it my duty to inform you.    Hoping this will be satisfactory to you, and not having  any desire to do Bro. Loveland any injury.    I remain,    Your Brother in the Gospel of Peace,  THOMAS WHEATLEY JR.   Presiding Elder.

 Aug 27 1894    Bro. W. F Tanner is a young  man just turned Twenty one  years of age, and of himself  is unable financially to go  on this mission.    I have confered with his parents  on the matter, and understand  from them that it would be  very difficult for them to give him  the needed financial assistance    If no other arrangement  can be made, and it is still  required of them, I think all  would do the best they can    Respectfully  J.

We have no means  to assist him with, and unless he  can raise the means or the  ward can do it for him, he  will have to be released for  the present as least.  J. F. S.

 CACHE VALLEY "the granary of Utah." in the chain of valleys that lies across the breast of Utah and Idaho, there are none fairer than Cache.  No other valley within the Territory or State can show such verdant hills, such sparkling streams, such fertile soil. To describe its won-  derful and picturesque surroundings requires time and space not at the disposal of the writer. Suffice it to say that a fairer spot, more varied  scenery or finer climate exists not on the face of the earth. The Valley is an oblong basin, of which the Wasatch mountains form the rim. It is 15   miles in width, and 60 miles in length, 4200 feet above the level of the sea, can cultivate a hundred thousand acres, and supports a population of 20,000  souls. There are more than a dozen towns and villages presented to view, each having from one to three thousand inhabitants, Logan, the county  seat, being the largest, with over six thousand. Cache Valley is first above all other western places; the climate is all that can be desired, short, mild  winters and the balance of the year such as cannot be surpassed. For fruit this valley cannot be beat for flavor, quality, quantity, size or productiveness,  and the finest wheat is raised here without irrigation, yielding heavy crops. Onyx and all the precious metals are in the surrounding mountains and  for investments in real estate this Valley cannot be excelled. Cache Valley has at present but one railroad, the Union Pacific. The academy in the  northern part of the valley, built by the people of Oneida Co., is a noble institution and worthy of patronage. All lines of business are represented, such  as lumber yards, planing mills, flouring mills (roller process), machine shops, mercantile of every description, the finest creamery and cheese factories  in the west, the best shoe and plow factories, nurseries, etc., The only Woolen Factory in Idaho is located at Franklin, where is being turned out a class  of yarns, blankets and linseys etc., that is not excelled in the east or west in quality or price. To the tourist and health seeker we say come and enjoy  this wonderful land, that has not a peer for beauty and healthfulness, and for those seeking investment and homes where all the blessings of life can be en-  joyed without a single drawback, we say come and you will never seek further. Letters of inquiry addressed to any of the advertisers on the back of  this will receive a prompt reply.    W. M. WEBSTER & CO.

 CACHE VALLEY "the granary of Utah." In the chain of valleys that lies across the breast of Utah and Idaho, there are none fairer than Cache.  No other valley within the Territory or State can show such verdant hills, such sparkling streams, such fertile soil. To describe its won-  derful and picturesque surroundings requires time and space not at the disposal of the writer. Suffice it to say that a fairer spot, more varied  scenery or finer climate exists not on the face of the earth. The Valley is an oblong basin, of which the Wasatch mountains form the rim. It is 15   miles in width, and 60 miles in length, 4200 feet above the level of the sea, can cultivate a hundred thousand acres, and supports a population of 20,000  souls. There are more than a dozen towns and villages presented to view, each having from one to three thousand inhabitants, Logan, the county  seat, being the largest, with over six thousand. Cache Valley is first above all other western places; the climate is all that can be desired, short, mild  winters and the balance of the year such as cannot be surpassed. For fruit this valley cannot be beat for flavor, quality, quantity, size or productiveness,  and the finest wheat is raised here without irrigation, yielding heavy crops. Onyx and all the precious metals are in the surrounding mountains and  for investments in real e state this Valley cannot be excelled. Cache Valley has at present but one railroad, the Union Pacific. The academy in the  northern part of the valley, built by the people of Oneida Co., is a noble institution and worthy of patronage. All lines of business are represented, such  as lumber yards, planing mills, flouring mills (roller process), machine shops, mercantile of every description, the finest creamery and cheese factories  in the west, the best shoe and plow factories, nurseries, etc. The only Woolen Factory in Idaho is located at Franklin, where is being turned out a class  of yarns, blankets and linseys etc., that is not excelled in the east or west in quality or price. To the tourist and health seeker we say come and enjoy  this wonderful land, that has not a peer for beauty and healthfulness, and for those seeking investment and homes where all the blessings of life can be en-  joyed without a single drawback, we say come and you will never seek further. Letters of inquiry addressed to any of the advertisers on the back of  this will receive a prompt reply.    W. M. WEBSTER & CO.

I have not answered them  and shall not do so till I hear further from you. You understand the whole   situation and can without doubt throw light upon points which appear mysterious  to him. If your health would permit, and you had time, I would like you to reply  to those parts of his letters which refer to the contract for the emigration.    We have regretted exceedingly to hear of your ill health and the   manner in which you have been afflicted. We were quite disappointed yi^e^sterday  morning at not meeting you, as we understood you had recovered sufficiently to  gi^e^t around. We hope that your improvement continues, and that you will soon be  able to move around as freely as ever. It is a very painful disease that from  which you are suffering, and you have our warmest sympathies for you in your  affliction. We trust that the acute pains have ceased, as they are very hard  to bear.

Richards,  Washington, D. C.    Dear Brethren:    Your esteemed favor of the 12th. inst. reached me two  or three days ago, upon my return from a visit to Manti. Since its receipt I have not  had the opportunity of submitting it to the Council, to whom, with myself, you ad-  dressed it, and therefore can only write to you my own views upon the subject men-  tioned in your letter. All the brethren of the Council, with two or three exceptions,  are at Manti.    I agree with you that it is important that every-  thing that can be done should be done to prevent anything inimical being inserted in  the platform of either parties, particularly in that of the Democractic party. We   shall do what we can through our friends to have the Republican platform kept free  from any injurious declaration concerning us. But this is a matter regarding which we  do not feel very hopeful, as the party has considered it a duty for a long time to  have something to say on every occasion respecting us.    We have been desirous to have the help of Brother  Richards in legal matters here and have missi^e^d him considerably, and we telegraphed 
 PRESIDENT'S OFFICE,  Salt Lake City, Utah, May 22, 1888.    Bishop Orson F. Whitney,    Dear Brother:    Your esteemed favor of the 18th. inst., informing  me of the progress that you are making in preparing the manuscript of the life of your  grandfather, the late President Heber C. Kimball, has been received and perused with in-  terest.    I am glad that steps have been taken to prepare   his life. It is one that will be read with profit by all Latter-day Saints and will be  encouraging to our young men. Your grandfather was a mighty man in bringing people to a  knowledge of the truth, and the Lord crowned his labors with great success. The record of   the labors of the faithful Elders should be preserved in the memories of the people of  God.    You mention the names of Brother Moses Thatcher  and Brother George Reynolds as two brethren who io^n^ your opinion would be suitable to go  through the work with you before it is published. I see no objection to either or both  of them; but Brother Moses Thatcher, I scarcely think, is in a position to do anything of  this kind at the present time. He is not in the city now and is not likely to be, as there  are duties which he has to attend to that will necessarily require his absence for some  time. Brother Reynolds is here, and any arrangement that you and he can make to read the  manuscript together will be agreeable to me, and any person whom you two decide upon to

 to know if he could be spared. Under the circumstances, however, we think it better  for him to remain till you close up your business, and your presence at St. Louis as  you return will doubtless be of benefit. We have been doing what we could through   other agencies to have the platform kept free from any declaration inimical to us.  If P. L. Williams could have his way, however, we should have something very bitter.    The news of the dedication of the Manti Temple you  will get through the public journals. Everything up to last accounts was passing off  in a most delightful manner there, and the Elders and Saints were having a very en-  joyable time. The Temple itself is a very magnificent structure, and its finish is   elegant. It exceeds in the superiority of its finish any building we have ever erect-  ed of a public character and will bear the closest scrutiny. The joiner work and  painting are exceedingly creditable.    Brother Erastus Snow improved very much after our  administration to him about two weeks ago; but during our absence at Manti he had a   relapse, brought on by Dr. Benedict being compelled to be absent himself in attendance  upon a very serious case that he had. Since then Brother Snow has not been so well.  We visited him last night and administered to him; found him very clear in his mind  and full of hope; but his condition physically was very serious. It will require the  utmost care in nursing and in managing his case to restore him to usefulness.    With love and praying the Lord to bless you,  I remain, Your Brother,    Wilford Woodruff 
 With love, in which Brother H^G^eorge Q. joins, and trusting that your   family is enjoying good health, and that we shall soon see you yourself,    I remain,  Your Brother,    Wilford Woodruff

WEST VIRGINIA  LUBRICATING  OIL.  VOLCANO, WEST VA.  As the distance from our wells at West Virginia is long and delays frequent on the  Railroads, and in order to facilitate trade and accomodate customers, we have made  arrangements with leading merchants in all the larger places in this country and abroad  to act as agents for the sale of our product. They will keep a stock on hand and sell at  our quotations, adding freight to their places of business. We shall do all we can to pro-  tect and facilitate our business relations. Our friends can get the Zero, Sweetser's and   Producer's brands of oil, of the various gravities, from    FOSTER, WALKER & CO.,  226 La Salle Street, CHICAGO.        We desire to call your attention to the article of pure, natural West Virginia Oil, produced by  us and sold under the above brand.        This oil, when produced, contains considerable earthy matter and water in emulsion. To  remove these and at the same time to make the oil of a satisfactory gravity, the oil is put into tanks  and subjected to steam heat for about ten days and nights. This causes the oil to become perfectly  clean, and at the same time makes it heavier through the expulsion of benzine and other detrimental  volatile substances by from one to two degrees or gravity,        We can recommend this oil as a perfect lubricator during the months from March to December  in the more Northern latititudes, while in the Southern latititudes not subject to extreme cold, we can  ALWAYS recommend it. We guaurantee it to stand a cold test of from ten to thirty degrees Fahrenheit,  without becoming too thick to flow readily and always to flow more readily than lard oil, to which it  is superoir as a lubricant.        We claim for this oil,  First—Freedom from water, grit or any impurity.  Second—Lasting qualities, it being superior in this respect to Sperm and Lard Oil.  Third—Not gumming or staining working parts of machinery.    Information regarding prices and rates of freight, etc., cheerfully given.    The following out of the railroads using our Oil have kindly permitted us to refer to them  regarding the quality of the oil we supply them, viz.:    The Philadelphia & Reading Railroad Co.  The Boston & Maine Railroad Co.  The Union Pacific Railroad Co.  The Portland & Rochester Railroad Co.  The Rock Island & Pacific R. R. Co.  The North-Western Railway Co.    The Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R. R. Co.  The Maine Central R. R. Co.  The Chicago, Alton & St. Louis R. R. Co.  The European & North American Co.  The Washington, Alexandria & Richmond R. R. Co.  The Inter-Colonial Railroad Co, Canada.    In fact nearly all the Railroads in this country and Europe are using West Virginia Oils.    Respectfully,    STILES & SWEETSER.

A Dewey of this place calling   him to fill a mission to the Southern States.    This (the Cambridge) ward has lately been  reorganized and Bro Dewey was selected by   myself as first Counselor in the Bishopric,  and I believe that had it been known that he   was to be selected his name would not have   been handed in for a missionary.    Cambridge ward has for a long time been in   poor condition owing to the sickness &^a^nd   subsequent death of Bp Coffin, and I have   felt that there is much room for Earnest   work here in getting the ward again into good   running order. We are very short of suitable material  and while Bro Dewey I believe to be admirably adapted to  his present position I know of no other in the ward  whom I could take to fill his place.

Bro Dewey has a wife who is almost  an invalid and he is confined at home  much of the time, but I do not believe this   would deter him from accepting the call  if the good of the work demanded it.    I would never knowingly interpose an  obstacle in the way of the growth or progress  of the work and believe that the good of this ward  will be subserved by allowing Bro Dewey to   remain at home.    Very truly   Your Bro in the Gospel  Wm A Hyde    Bro. Dewey's name was suggested by   the Presidency of the Stake    I see no reason why bro. Dewey could not take hold   as a counselor and help for a time to get the ward in   good shape, and then take a mission. This would leave   the Bp. & one counselor—a majority—to look after the ward  until he returned.    J. F. S.

Wm Cameron in which he gives a detailed  statement of his financial condition. Brother  Cameron is a young strong healthy man  and his family consists of a wife and one  child, is a native of Scotland. If he is   sent on a mission at all he would prefer to   go to his native country, but it would probably   be better to defer sending him for the present   on account of his indigent circumstances, and   he does not seem to exhibit that degree of faith   and willingness to respond that is generally  manifested by the brethren when they receive  letters of inquiry from the First Presidency  in relations to their willingness to go on mission.    Very respectfully your brother  Robt Morris  Bp 11th Ward    Unless bro. Cameron has faith   and means to respond to this call  as other Elders do, we do not want  him to go, but if he has not, I am sorry   for him J. F. S.

 St. George 1st Jan 1893    Elder Jos. D C Young  Temple Block  Salt Lake City    Dear Brother    Yours of the 28th instant. In regard to chairs for seating, Creation, Garden, Telestial and   Terrestrial rooms in Salt Lake Temple, and suggestions in relation to font asked for, came to   hand today. -[Above line]- -{There are no objections stated I know of in using the seat referred to}- I  think the iron chairs will do very well for the creation room. [redacted text]    In regard to the font, the one in Manti Temple is the style you expect to follow. Very   good. But should not be as deep as to expose the person being baptized to the gaze of spectators  on the side or at the end in clothing becoming disarranged by the pull of the water.    Suggest seats for witnesses as well as Recorder and confirmers be so arranged so that all can see  as well as hear the blessing. As no steps were cast in the present temples by which to assist into  the confirmation chair, I would suggest that this be done. The steps may be added after the   baptismal font is in place. Enclosed plans to find what care considered practicable. The place for  desk here given for the Recorder -[Words erased]- will perceivably put him in the most  comfortable position to perform the duty enjoined upon him in the Doctrine and Covenants 
 OFFICE OF  The First Presidency  of the  Church of Jesus Christ  of  Latter-day Saints    P.O. Box, B. Salt Lake City, Utah. March 19th, 1894.    Elder Cornelius D. Schettler,    Dear Brother:    I have taken it upon myself to write a few lines to our young  Elders who went together from Salt Lake upon their first mission to  Germany. We have had a number of letters from Owen, and I have liked  very much the spirit of them.    Mrs. Woodruff and myself took supper with your father and  mother on the 14th and we had a good time. Herman and Irene made us  splendid music. A good deal was said about Cornelius' mission and the  other boys. Of course, you are now beginning to make your first mark  in the ministry. I have been there before you and I know what it is;  though you have the language to learn, which I did not. I went on my  first mission without purse or scrip. I went through the wilderness,  waded swamps, traveled alone as a priest, and baptized many that I could  not confirm. You are a Seventy and can attend to all the ordinances  necessary in organizing branches of the Church. I have great hopes in  you young men. I suppose you naturally will have some difficulty in  preaching to these foreign governments considering the laws and politics.  But I think there is a good deal of the blood of Israel in Germany and  Switzerland. We have everything to encourage us in searching out the  honest in heart among the nations. The Lord told Oliver Cowdery that if  he spent his whole life in saving one soul how great would be his joy in  the eternal world over that one soul. I have felt that I have great  cause to rejoice in that respect; I have had the credit of bringing more
