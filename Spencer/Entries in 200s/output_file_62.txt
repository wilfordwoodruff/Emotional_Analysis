 TO THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES,GREETING.THERE IS NOW READY FOR DELIVERY,COLONEL RALPH DE CLAIRMONT'SGREAT BOOKREFORM,An Essay on the Political, Financial and Social Condition of theUnited States, showing Dangers, Defectsand Remedies.Bound in cloth, gilt lettering, price $1.25. Copyrighted.The book embraces the following important matter: Preface. Chapter I.Caveat Patria: II. Law and Justice; III. Legislation; IV. Press; V. Religion;VI. Education; VII. Finance; VIII. Federal Government; IX. United StatesArmy. Appendix: Constitution of the United States: Constitution of the SwissConfederation.The various subjects contained in this book are treated in an entirely impartial manner, froman independent and lofty standpoint, free from all bias and party spirit. The author has only thewelfare of the United States in general and that of the people at heart.The book is written in a bold and fearless style, pointing out all the dangers and evils of thepresent period and of the future, at the same time indicating the corresponding remedies. The styleof the book, though frequently sarcastical and full of indignation at the most flagrant abuses, is chasteand may be read by all, old and young, for their benefit and instruction; it is easy to comprehendby all classes of our people, from the merchant prince to the humble laborer.The last chapter, highly eulogistic of and recommending an increase of the United States Armyto fifty thousand men, besides advocating other important changes and improvements in the service,will be of the highest interest to the Officers of the Army.  They will find among other interestingtopics an account of the model organization of the army of Switzerland and reference to otherEuropean systems.The author begs to refer to the following flattering endorsement of his book by one of theprincipal staff officers of the U.S. Army:San Francisco, October 11, 1894."I commend to my brother officers and the public generally Colonel Ralph de Clairmont's book onthe POLITICAL, FINANCIAL AND SOCIAL CONDITION OF THE UNITED STATES. It is a trenchantand vigorous essay on the times by an author of wide learning, extensive and accurate knowledge of history,vast experience in our national and in foreign affairs, and, above all, keen insight into the events of theday. It is a spicy survey of the existing conditions of our country, and wholly worthy of attentive perusaland study. And while it touches upon vital questions, it yet carries the reader along as delightfully asany sensible romance. It gives me sincere pleasure to heartily commend the work to others."The first edition is nearly all disposed of. In order to secure a copy of this great book, pleasesend your order by bearer, or by postal card, to R. de Clairmont, No. 6 Eddy Street, San Francisco,Cal., and it will be promptly forwarded to you upon payment of $1.25.

 REFORM.—Colonel Ralph de Clairmont,a master of languages, a traveler andwriter, who for many years has been aresident of this city, has just issued a bookof over 260 pages, which is an essay on thepolitical, financial and social condition ofthe United States. The essay is bold andit points to dangers and defects and sug-gest remedies for existing evils. Thewriter, who has devoted to the subject ofhis book a great deal of close attention,and has studied it from every point ofview. gives his impression in plain butcomprehensive language in different chap-ters which treat of caveat patria, law andjustice, legislation, the press, education,religion, finance, the Federal Governmentand the United States army. He dwellsupon the various abuses that he has en-countered in the pursuit of his subject andfor each has a suggestion for a correctionof the same. With a view to compariosn,the author presents the constitution ofthe United States together with the one ofthe Republic of Switzerland. The latteris based on that of the United STates. Init are lacking features which the Moun-tain Republic has, after many years ofcareful watching, concluded could beomitted and for which it has substitutedothers which are deemed superior. In thechapter on the army there are many valu-able suggestions. [San Francisco: Pub-lished for the author.]

B. Wallace. Brothers Gates, Higbee, Johnson, LebaronYoung & Smith are on board with me. Some 3 or 4 of them are unwell & myselfalso but we think we are recovering slowly. I sincerely hope you & your family are enjoying good health and I feel to congratulate you upon your release from thatfield of labor; for I feel as if I would prefer almost any othee nation on the earth to theUnited States as a field of labor.My particular object in writing you at this time is to make request of you concerninga young sister Lucy Fox who came over with Littlefield Day & others to N. York hermother did not know the spirits they were of or she would not have let her come with themHer oldest sister Charlotte Fox is in the valley & a member of my family, she feelsvery anxious about Lucy lest she may have fallen into the society of such as would lead herastray & bring a lasting reproach upon her character. She thinks of Lucy with many tears.Would you be so kind br Woodruff as to ascertain how it is with her and ifyou could get her a place with a family wanting help, that for her services would bring herwith them to the valley, she could serve them till it was sufficient, till they were satisfied; youwould be doing good perhaps saving a soul from death & I should feel myself under lastingobligation to you and be most happy to reciprocate your kindness in any way whichopportunity might present. The family all belong to the church & were of excellent moralcharacter which I hope still is the case. Be so kind as write me at all events to theStar Office Liverpool as soon as you are prepared to give me what information you mayobtain about Lucy's situation, & chances of going west. Please also give me something ofyour prospects at gleaning Grapes after the Vintage is done, & any thing you may feel tobestow I shall be happy to receive; iIt has been sometime since we had communion with each other.With many good wishes to yourself & family I subscribe myself Y[ou]r fellow ServantF.

 Honeyville, Box Elder County, Utah.July 25th, 1894.President W. Woodruff,Dear Brother:—I am informed that Bro. DavidLoveland, of Honeyville, is to go on a mission to the Southern States inthe month of September. And I felt it my duty as presiding elder of thatward to inform you of his financial situation.I signed the letter which he wrote to you some time ago,but having only just been called there to preside, his financial situationwas misrepresented to me by himself and I thought it my duty to informyou how he is situated at the present time.He has quite a large family to support and they havenothing to depend upon only what he earns by laboring for other people bydays' work having scarcely any land of his own, and he is in debt about$200.00 for the house and land where he resides at the present time andI know that his family is quite destitute at the present time both forfood and clothing, and I realize his wife would not be able to send himany means during his absence from home. And having found out his truesituation I felt it my duty to inform you.Hoping this will be satisfactory to you, and not havingany desire to do Bro. Loveland any injury.I remain,Your Brother in the Gospel of Peace,THOMAS WHEATLEY JR. Presiding Elder.

 CACHE VALLEY "the granary of Utah." in the chain of valleys that lies across the breast of Utah and Idaho, there are none fairer than Cache.No other valley within the Territory or State can show such verdant hills, such sparkling streams, such fertile soil. To describe its won-derful and picturesque surroundings requires time and space not at the disposal of the writer. Suffice it to say that a fairer spot, more variedscenery or finer climate exists not on the face of the earth. The Valley is an oblong basin, of which the Wasatch mountains form the rim. It is 15 miles in width, and 60 miles in length, 4200 feet above the level of the sea, can cultivate a hundred thousand acres, and supports a population of 20,000souls. There are more than a dozen towns and villages presented to view, each having from one to three thousand inhabitants, Logan, the countyseat, being the largest, with over six thousand. Cache Valley is first above all other western places; the climate is all that can be desired, short, mildwinters and the balance of the year such as cannot be surpassed. For fruit this valley cannot be beat for flavor, quality, quantity, size or productiveness,and the finest wheat is raised here without irrigation, yielding heavy crops. Onyx and all the precious metals are in the surrounding mountains andfor investments in real estate this Valley cannot be excelled. Cache Valley has at present but one railroad, the Union Pacific. The academy in thenorthern part of the valley, built by the people of Oneida Co., is a noble institution and worthy of patronage. All lines of business are represented, suchas lumber yards, planing mills, flouring mills (roller process), machine shops, mercantile of every description, the finest creamery and cheese factoriesin the west, the best shoe and plow factories, nurseries, etc., The only Woolen Factory in Idaho is located at Franklin, where is being turned out a classof yarns, blankets and linseys etc., that is not excelled in the east or west in quality or price. To the tourist and health seeker we say come and enjoythis wonderful land, that has not a peer for beauty and healthfulness, and for those seeking investment and homes where all the blessings of life can be en-joyed without a single drawback, we say come and you will never seek further.

Richards,Washington, D. C.Dear Brethren:Your esteemed favor of the 12th. inst. reached me twoor three days ago, upon my return from a visit to Manti. Since its receipt I have nothad the opportunity of submitting it to the Council, to whom, with myself, you ad-dressed it, and therefore can only write to you my own views upon the subject men-tioned in your letter. All the brethren of the Council, with two or three exceptions,are at Manti.I agree with you that it is important that every-thing that can be done should be done to prevent anything inimical being inserted inthe platform of either parties, particularly in that of the Democractic party. We shall do what we can through our friends to have the Republican platform kept freefrom any injurious declaration concerning us. But this is a matter regarding which wedo not feel very hopeful, as the party has considered it a duty for a long time tohave something to say on every occasion respecting us.We have been desirous to have the help of BrotherRichards in legal matters here and have missi^e^d him considerably, and we telegraphed 
 PRESIDENT'S OFFICE,Salt Lake City, Utah, May 22, 1888.Bishop Orson F. Whitney,Dear Brother:Your esteemed favor of the 18th. inst., informingme of the progress that you are making in preparing the manuscript of the life of yourgrandfather, the late President Heber C. Kimball, has been received and perused with in-terest.I am glad that steps have been taken to prepare his life. It is one that will be read with profit by all Latter-day Saints and will beencouraging to our young men. Your grandfather was a mighty man in bringing people to aknowledge of the truth, and the Lord crowned his labors with great success. The record of the labors of the faithful Elders should be preserved in the memories of the people ofGod.You mention the names of Brother Moses Thatcherand Brother George Reynolds as two brethren who io^n^ your opinion would be suitable to gothrough the work with you before it is published. I see no objection to either or bothof them; but Brother Moses Thatcher, I scarcely think, is in a position to do anything ofthis kind at the present time. He is not in the city now and is not likely to be, as thereare duties which he has to attend to that will necessarily require his absence for sometime. Brother Reynolds is here, and any arrangement that you and he can make to read themanuscript together will be agreeable to me, and any person whom you two decide upon to

 to know if he could be spared. Under the circumstances, however, we think it betterfor him to remain till you close up your business, and your presence at St. Louis asyou return will doubtless be of benefit. We have been doing what we could through other agencies to have the platform kept free from any declaration inimical to us.If P. L. Williams could have his way, however, we should have something very bitter.The news of the dedication of the Manti Temple youwill get through the public journals. Everything up to last accounts was passing offin a most delightful manner there, and the Elders and Saints were having a very en-joyable time. The Temple itself is a very magnificent structure, and its finish is elegant. It exceeds in the superiority of its finish any building we have ever erect-ed of a public character and will bear the closest scrutiny. The joiner work andpainting are exceedingly creditable.Brother Erastus Snow improved very much after ouradministration to him about two weeks ago; but during our absence at Manti he had a relapse, brought on by Dr. Benedict being compelled to be absent himself in attendanceupon a very serious case that he had. Since then Brother Snow has not been so well.We visited him last night and administered to him; found him very clear in his mindand full of hope; but his condition physically was very serious. It will require theutmost care in nursing and in managing his case to restore him to usefulness.With love and praying the Lord to bless you,I remain, Your Brother,Wilford Woodruff 
 With love, in which Brother H^G^eorge Q. joins, and trusting that your family is enjoying good health, and that we shall soon see you yourself,I remain,Your Brother,Wilford Woodruff

SWEETSER & CO.Grav.WEST VIRGINIALUBRICATINGOIL.VOLCANO, WEST VA.As the distance from our wells at West Virginia is long and delays frequent on theRailroads, and in order to facilitate trade and accomodate customers, we have madearrangements with leading merchants in all the larger places in this country and abroadto act as agents for the sale of our product. They will keep a stock on hand and sell atour quotations, adding freight to their places of business. We shall do all we can to pro-tect and facilitate our business relations. Our friends can get the Zero, Sweetser's and Producer's brands of oil, of the various gravities, fromFOSTER, WALKER & CO.,226 La Salle Street, CHICAGO.We desire to call your attention to the article of pure, natural West Virginia Oil, produced byus and sold under the above brand.This oil, when produced, contains considerable earthy matter and water in emulsion. Toremove these and at the same time to make the oil of a satisfactory gravity, the oil is put into tanksand subjected to steam heat for about ten days and nights. This causes the oil to become perfectlyclean, and at the same time makes it heavier through the expulsion of benzine and other detrimentalvolatile substances by from one to two degrees or gravity,We can recommend this oil as a perfect lubricator during the months from March to Decemberin the more Northern latititudes, while in the Southern latititudes not subject to extreme cold, we canALWAYS recommend it. We guaurantee it to stand a cold test of from ten to thirty degrees Fahrenheit,without becoming too thick to flow readily and always to flow more readily than lard oil, to which itis superoir as a lubricant.We claim for this oil,First—Freedom from water, grit or any impurity.Second—Lasting qualities, it being superior in this respect to Sperm and Lard Oil.Third—Not gumming or staining working parts of machinery.Information regarding prices and rates of freight, etc., cheerfully given.The following out of the railroads using our Oil have kindly permitted us to refer to themregarding the quality of the oil we supply them, viz.:The Philadelphia & Reading Railroad Co.The Boston & Maine Railroad Co.The Union Pacific Railroad Co.The Portland & Rochester Railroad Co.The Rock Island & Pacific R. R. Co.The North-Western Railway Co.The Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R. R. Co.The Maine Central R. R. Co.The Chicago, Alton & St. Louis R. R. Co.The European & North American Co.The Washington, Alexandria & Richmond R. R. Co.The Inter-Colonial Railroad Co, Canada.In fact nearly all the Railroads in this country and Europe are using West Virginia Oils.Respectfully,STILES & SWEETSER.

In regard to chairs for seating, Creation, Garden, Telestial and Terrestrial rooms in Salt Lake Temple, and suggestions in relation to font asked for, came to hand today. -[Above line]- -{There are no objections stated I know of in using the seat referred to}- Ithink the iron chairs will do very well for the creation room. [redacted text]In regard to the font, the one in Manti Temple is the style you expect to follow. Very good. But should not be as deep as to expose the person being baptized to the gaze of spectatorson the side or at the end in clothing becoming disarranged by the pull of the water.Suggest seats for witnesses as well as Recorder and confirmers be so arranged so that all can seeas well as hear the blessing. As no steps were cast in the present temples by which to assist intothe confirmation chair, I would suggest that this be done. The steps may be added after the baptismal font is in place. Enclosed plans to find what care considered practicable. The place fordesk here given for the Recorder -[Words erased]- will perceivably put him in the mostcomfortable position to perform the duty enjoined upon him in the Doctrine and Covenants

Schettler,Dear Brother:I have taken it upon myself to write a few lines to our youngElders who went together from Salt Lake upon their first mission toGermany. We have had a number of letters from Owen, and I have likedvery much the spirit of them.Mrs. Woodruff and myself took supper with your father andmother on the 14th and we had a good time. Herman and Irene made ussplendid music. A good deal was said about Cornelius' mission and theother boys. Of course, you are now beginning to make your first markin the ministry. I have been there before you and I know what it is;though you have the language to learn, which I did not. I went on myfirst mission without purse or scrip. I went through the wilderness,waded swamps, traveled alone as a priest, and baptized many that I couldnot confirm. You are a Seventy and can attend to all the ordinancesnecessary in organizing branches of the Church. I have great hopes inyou young men. I suppose you naturally will have some difficulty inpreaching to these foreign governments considering the laws and politics.But I think there is a good deal of the blood of Israel in Germany andSwitzerland. We have everything to encourage us in searching out thehonest in heart among the nations. The Lord told Oliver Cowdery that ifhe spent his whole life in saving one soul how great would be his joy inthe eternal world over that one soul.
