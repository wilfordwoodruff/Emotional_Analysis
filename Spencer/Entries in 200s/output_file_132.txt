 [upside-down text]  Geo. A. Smith  [upside-down text]    Washington D C.  July 27, 1856    Brother Woodruff: As a sunday morn-  ing pleasure we sit down to write altho the  weather is so hot that our river run like oil.    The House of Representatives have refused to pass  the Army appropriation Bill, without a proviso  that no part of the Army should be used to support  the Territorial Government in Kansas against  the Free State party. Two Three weeks now closes  the session and very little can be done to benefit  anybody, several hundred private Bills must  be laid over. The Country is suffering from  severe drouth. The general cry from all quarters  is for rain. The wheat harvest has been  very abundant. When I first came here  and learned Brother Bernhisel's feelings  I felt quite uneasy and half a notion to ^try to^ push  our Bill into the Senate Dr or no Dr, one  day while ^praying &^ reflecting upon the subject I dropped  to sleep on a Soffa and dreamed, that there  was a large train of Cars that I had to start  I laid hold of them and pushed with all 
 we should have power to accomplish.    I have several times suggested  to the Dr the propriety of our holding prayer-  meetings together. The last conversation  I had with him on the subject I advised  him to get some garments, which he does  not wareear and has no outfit whatever  for a prayer-room; but he replied that he  was like Brother Kimball preferred to do his   praying alone. I have since related to him  many circumstances that occurred with you  and me on our mission through Michigan  in 1844 how the Lord answerd our prayer so  astonishingly in the case of M Sirvine sister  Wilseys children &c and I think I shall  make a convert of him before next session.  He says he asked Joseph in particular if drawers  and shirts would not answer as well as garments  If cut &c. He is certainly one hitch older  fogy than I am on this subject.    He has introduced me to many members  of Congress. He is universally respected by them 
 [sideways text] George A Smith July 27  1856  Had a good Dream  Answd April 7 1857 [end sideways text]    I am more confirmed than ever that he  he is the right man for our Delegate.  To force a measure here is impossible,  to coax it along under the present Bad  state of feeling is slow work, and the Slavery  and ante-Slavery hate each other most  desparately, and Brooks Cane ing Sumner  has made it no better.    President Pierce is about the  smallest man in the City judging  from the manner in which they treat   him — even the Democratic Senate have  passed several Bills over the Presidents Vetoes  Douglas, Cass, Dodge and other  leading Democrats voting against  Pierce. All the papers that I have   seen except the Washington Union  are down upon Pierce.    I write this Confidential  Letter principally as I thought my dream  had perhapse better be preserved in the  Archives of your office. If you think  the last ^2^ pages is improper to preserve [current]  take it in two. Brother Heywood sends  his respects. Remember me to all the  Clerks in the Hystory Office and to all  good friends. I shall send this letter  by Brother Babbitt who has done all he  could to aid the intensty of Desent while here 
 Nauvoo Sund^a^y Evening Nov 9rth 1845    Elder Woodruff I seat myself to communicate a few words to you.  I have written once to you since our recent difficulties commenced & should  have continued to write had not the press of business & excitement pre-  vented. We are all making preparations to move beyond the Rocky  Mountains early in the Spring coming. The timber is already got  out for several hundred wagons & a multitude of men at work get-  ing more & every thing possible is doing to get ready in good season.  The work on the Temple is hurried with all speed, the upper rooms  are being plastered & in about 3 or 4 weeks we shall be giving  the endowment to the Elders, the Lord & Governer willing: Every  scheme is in foot to get something against the twelve, Wm Smith  is doing all he can in St Louis, & amongst other things he has pub-  lished that "the 12 Apostles are very licentious & he for opposing  them has been cut off". He is very bitter, but has very few  followers, as the Saints are too well acquainted with his charac-  ter to be led astray by him, as his course in the East & in Nauvoo is  generaly known. The Twelve meet in council every day & pray  for the deliverance of the Saints from bondage, & we are heard by our  Father, & in a great number of instances have been answered to our  own astonishment, Elder Hyde has returned with 4500 yds of  Canvass for the Tabernacle. The Circuit Court went of well,  not a single house burner was arrested, & all the brethren who  were charged with crime are discharged; the sheriff was recog-  nised for his appearance at court to be tried for the murder of  F A Worrell, his bonds are $3000, he is exercising all the duties of sheriff,  & is a brave & patriotic man & the only high officer in the State who has  lived ^tried^ to maintain the supremacy of the law. (I have seen a letter from ^Br^ Elder  Ward to Elder O Hyde, he gave some news; I think his egotism be-  speaks a slight touch of the "big head." I hope I am mistaken, but if  I am not, I believe from the Spirit of that letter, it would do him  good to travel over the mountains with us & get another kind of  experience from that he is called to now, as a change is good, you  know better than I, every man has his own way.) We had to stop  the Nauvoo House on account of the mob. The Governor has 100 men  stationed at Carthage to keep the peace as he says, but I say to plague the  Saints; they have been still for a few days; All the blacklegs in the 
 country are trying to heap their crimes on us, & nothing but the power of  God has preserved us this season, & nothing short can keep us here in  peace this Winter; be He hears our prayers every day & delivers  us from their hands. We have four peices of cannon & a great  number of fifteen shooter rifles & many six shooter pistols & if a  c[o]llision should take place with the mob we would stand a good  chance to give them a sound scrubbing; but I feel confident that  we shall move away without the loss of life. All the brethren are  anxious to go & a great many others are going with us. Elders  Sherwood & John S Fullmer, have been to Emmetts company  & baptised them all again, they are now camped on the Missouri  River above the mouth of the Sioux River about 700 miles from here  in the Buffalo country; the Sioux Chiefs are very friendly to them &  they get plenty of buffalo hmeat. Monday evening the 10th I have  been engaged revising the church history with Brs Richards, Young,  & Kimball. We read over the letters we wrote to the Times & Seasons  when in London, this makes us think of Wilford; I find they were  badly printed. I sent a team to day to Quincy for a load of iron to fix  up my wagons for Van Couver's Island, Salt Lake or some-  where else. Tomorrow Br Heywood is going to make a con-  tract with some iron houses for a large amount for the companies;  moving is all the talk here. Elder Babbitt has gone to see the  leading men in St Louis & Cincinatti to endeavor to make  sale of property. We have some encouragement of renting  our Temple to the Romans. I have got 3 yoke of oxen to-  wards a team to move with. We shall go principally with ox  teams as they will live on grass. We shall cross the mountains   at the South pass in 42 Degreses of N Latitude, & start as early  as possible for cattle to live on grass. Emmigration is rolling  in very fast; a company of Saints arrived here last night from  Northbridge Masss; every house in the city is crowded, our  house contains about forty all the time. We have built all  round the house I lived in, since you left here. Our town  contains over 11,000 inhabitants, we have above 20,000 people  to move from this country next Spring, or we must fight a  mob composed of most of the State, & the Govr says we can-  not be protected from mob violence by State authorities 
 the word is, "you must go;" & we are sick of a liberty so  terrible, ^&^ freedom so very oppressive. Elder Grant  has returned from Philadelphia with his family, all  in good health & spirits. I have been improving in my  health for the past year, my lungs are recovering slowly  & are nearly well. Many have died this summer & fall  Br Wm Gehan, Br Drollinger, Br Stephen Winchester's son  Alexander, Br John Cheese, Hannah Ells, Olive Frost,  John Low, Gen Dunham died last summer in the seneca  nation, & many others have been called away as the fall has  been sickly. Notwithstanding the great amount of grain  burnt by the mob, an abundance is among the Saints, to sus-  tain them all; the harvest was abundant, every kind of grain  is ^in^ great plenty; but the flour mills in our city are not  sufficient to do the grinding for the country around.  Br Richards has been sick some time, but his health is  improving, this has delayed the history. Novr 12th Yesterday  I visited Br & Sister Webster, found them well & in first rate  spirits, they said little Wilford was in good health & fine spi-  rits, they received a letter from you a short time since [page torn]  spent the day in reading the Church history; the evening  with the council of the 12 engaged in preparing an epistle  to the saints at home & abroad concerning our removal & a  general invitation to all honorable law abiding men to ac-  company us. The Bishops bought 100,000 ft of pine  lumber for the finishing of the Temple & making wagon  boxes. Bathsheba sends love to yourself & your kind lady.  I wish to be remembered also. Close by subscribing  myself yours as ever in the bonds of the covenant    George A Smith

I have not known of their   receiving it, think if they had, I should  have known it.  It is very pleasant to me   to hear from my friends and more to so to see   them.  how much I want to see you all    I should be willing to make some sac  rifice to spend a few days with you   or to see you here,  but it is uncertain   when and where we may meet, if not   on earth may it be in heaven    You refer to some unkind feelings to   ward Utah, I hear of none.  Sin and ini  quity abounds to a great extent with us.    Our ministers are becomeing political Priests   jumping out of the pulpit with politics and   from politics jumping into an teasing   robing that.  It is new with them bleed  ing Remsus., in that since it was O. The Pope   The Pope, he will have us all murdered 
 Ms 1352 bx 6 fd 28 #12    F Carter July 9th 1856  Anserd  located in Historian Book    Puttand July 9th 56  My dear Sister & Brother    Yesterday I rec.d your   very kind letter of June 1st, and was glad   to hear from you after so long  a time,    I dont know, really when I have had   a letter before from you, and I fear that   you do not get mine,  I was glad to hear   that you are quite well,  Mr. Woodruff   must have had a very severe attack   and his recovery seems quite Providential    You speak of my visiting you, it   would afford me great pleasure to do   so but when that time will come is   quite uncertain.  presume your city has   increased very much since I was  there,  I have quite a number of friends   there that I should like to see, Brother   Hardy, Smoot, Sister [Cewand] &c. by the way   how is Mrs. [Cewand] these days?  please   give my regards to her and all of my   old friends and acquaintace with you.   
 So they take up one humbug after another  They now see that they had much more   reason to fear the Devil than they had the   Pope,  God works in a mysterious way, and   can make the wrath of men to praise Him  Oh that men would learn to love each   other rather than to hate and injure them    I was glad to hear the you are all well  Ezra, Judith and Annie, have gone out   well and will see Rhoda and Fabyan.  They were all well a short time since   and prospering.  I was at Scenlure, two days   since.  Phebe, those grand old elms are as   grand and majestic as ever.  When do   you think you will see them, and an   respected father.  you may see them, but   probably not him in this world.    Mouther is very poorly is now in N.York  under the care of a Physician.  I think a   month or two will determine something   with her.  She must be helped to stand it   much longer.  Our children are well   our friends generally are quite well.  Mary   C. Fabyan is merried to a Meth minister   Ira Foes was in today done harvesting, can good   Potatoes [illegible] , please write often.  I will write again   soon, give much love to all..  May God keep us and   bless us and may we all meet in heaven is the daily   prayer of   Very truly yours [illegible] 
 We are all as well as usual.  Mrs. Carters   health continues very poor..  She is now   quite feeble but keeps about the most of the   time.  Father was in last week and   spent some days with us, he is quite   well, and cotinues very smart.    Aunt Fabyon is as well as usual and   our friends generally at [Scenbere,] with   no important changes  Mary Fabyans  will probably be married within a week,  the third wife of a Methodist minister  Mr [Menthen] and family are well and   prospering,  I was at Scenbere, a few days   since and found it very pleasant    We hear from Illinois occasionally, all  quite well there now.  Rhoda is very   rugged since she recovered from her   severe illness.  Simon is here and in   tends to spend the summer on account   of his health, which is not very good    Ira and family we well.  They have a   young Son there which is quite gratifying   to them, have quite a little family around them. 
 We shall probably have quite an  exciting fall, Politically, Buchanan and   Fremont have been nominated for the   Presidency.  B. will no doubt be elected    By our late arrivals from Europe we   have very favorable prospects that peace   between the two countries will be continued  between the two countries.  It was feared that   the dismissal of the Eng. Minister at   Washington and some other misunderstandings   would lead to difficulty.  I am sorry to   say that many of our leading Politicians   of all parties, if possible, are becoming more   corrupt than ever, what the result will   be we cannot tell, the prospect now is   that a dissolution of the Union will   take place before many years, whether that   would be attended with serious consequences   we can hardly tell.  The evil one is very   busy and he finds great numbers that he   contacts.  Spiritualism is flourishing like   a green bery tree, the Devels great and per  haps last harvest. 
 This life, how short it is, compared   with the next, and what a world   of trial, disappointments and pains, but   there is a land of pure delight    What a great  thing it is to have   a treasure in heaven, God be our Father  and heaven for our home.  That is enough  This mortel posseses but little attraction   to me  on my own account, but we   have friends that must be provided   for.  How great our occasion for gratitude   to God for all His mercies and goodness   to us.  I am astonished and pained that   I have so little love for Him, but I   would love Him with all my heart    You and yours are always  remembered by   me in my feeble prayers, and you must   remember us in such occasions and   if we are not permitted to meet   here again upon earth may we and   all our dear friends meet where sin   and sorrow can never come and parting   are [nere] known..  Please remember me   very kindly to Mrs. Fess and family and   all friends.  Mrs. Carter sends much love   to all.  hoping to hear from you often    I am very truely yours.  I. F Carter

 Washington City June 4, 1856    Mr Wildord Woodruff,    Dear Sir,    Your communications   of the 27th of March and of the 9th of   April were received on the 31st ultimo.  Be pleased to accept my thanks for your  kindness to my family. I presume you   are apprized ere this that I have paid   Messrs Sanborn & Carter one hundred   and five dollars on your account.  It is distressing to hear of the suffering among   our people in consequence of the   scarcity of provisions, and also of the   loss of sheep and stock in consequence   of the severity of the past winter, and   by Indian depredations. The trial through   which the church is now passing is doubt-  less the most severe that she has ever   passed through. Those who endure this   chastening of the Lord without 
 apostatising, or murmuring against God,   will probably endure to the end.    I regret to hear that brother Cain is   indisposed.  Will you be good enough   to ask him what disposition he has   made of my oxen and wagon, and   whether he has made any arrangement   to have my family supplied with wood   during the present summer and the   ensuing winter, also whether the two or   three loads of wood due for house   rent have been paid?    This morning I deposited in the post office   a bill of lading and bills of goods which   I trust will reach you in safety.  My wagon containing the goods will   start from old winter quarters if it   has not already started.  If you cannot   raise meawhat means my family may need  from goods and other sources, you will   draw upon me for what they may 
 require. E. Snow & Co. or perhaps any other   house would I suppose give you the   cash for a small draft payable at one   day after sight.    I am quite disappointed at the course   that Mr. Houtz is pursuing, he has not   done as he agreed to do.    Have the goodness to let me hear  from you as often as you can conveniently.  Brother Hautz was to kill thirteen hogs in   December last, one fourth of them belonged   to me, and after supplying my family   he was to sell the pork, he was to sell the   remander and hand you the money.  If he has not done so, will you please   to endeavor to collect it. Say to him that   my family needs it. Before I left I desired   you to pay brother Houtz some eight   or ten dollars on account of some little   improvements he proposed to make, but   you will pay him nothing more, 
 Washington City, April 7, 1856    Dear Brother,    Inclosed is the receipt of Messrs   Sanborn & Carter for one hundred and   five dollars.    Brother Houtz was to kill thirteen  hogs in December, one fourth of which   belonged to me, and the pork of which, after   delivering as much to my family as they   required, he was to dispose of, and pay   the proceeds of the sales to you. Has he   done so? Have you received any flour   from him since you wrote last? Be  kind enough to keep me informed how   he gets on with the mill.    The prospects for the speedy admission   of Utah into the Union as a State are  dark and gloomy.    Yours in the Gospel  John M. Bernhisel    Mr Woodruff.

I got acquainted  with Capt Leonard U. S. Army, who is  in command of liberty arcinal. He  learned I was from Utah—He says I  have read your constitution and it is a  good one. I am in favor of your ad-  mission—499 persons with 100 hand  carts left on the 7th & 9th—Iowa City for  Utah in Charge of Edmond Ellsworth  & Danl McArthur—another train  of Welsh Brethern will start next tuesday

They serrounded the  camp as they started, with their  flags flying. But the teams  being a little wild three axel-  trees were broken the first  day, but were soon repaird.  The civil war in Kansas ren-  ders it dangerous for any  man to pass through the  territory. The Yankees are   learning some of the sweets  of Missouri justice. Murders  are common. Col.

 [upside-down text]   Geo. A. Smith   [end of upside-down text]    Washington D. C. July 15, 1856    Elder W. Woodruff    I received from you a very welcome  and instructing letter for which I return  you my thanks. My mission to Wash-  ington appears to be a dull affair    Secretary Babbitt left here this morning  for Salt Lake. bBy him I have sent letters  to President Young—My family, yourself  and many others—I write this to send by  mail. Our Know Nothing Congress or rather  Black Republican House of Representatives  are a regular Blue Law set of fellows, but the  House has been occupied ever since I came  here with Kansas quarrels and Sumners  Caneing—evry kind of business seems to be  at a stand. The House passed a Bill   to admit Kansas as a Free State on the  Constitution framed last winter. They  done this for political effect knowing that it  could not pass the Senate. The Senate  have passed a Bill to authorize Kansas   to form a Constitution fully believing  that the House would reject their Bill.    In this manner our statesmen fool  away from their time and the real business of the  Country rejected; while foolish men   quarrel with each other. 
 Since the Black Republicans and old  Tom Benton have been making  such a muss about Govr Young and  Utah & Poligamy President Pierce has  become somewhat Bitter in his feelings  at least Dr Bernhisel informs me that the  Presidents modest feelings are annoyed  with Govr Young's interfeering with the   Juries as set forth inby Bro Brigham in the  Tabernacle as set forth in the Tabernacle    Feb 24, 1856 Watts Report of which Mr Pierce  has in his possession as published in the  52 No of the 5th Volume ^Deseret News^ page 412 where you  will see the President sets forth the rascality  of Courts and Lawyers and to make good   his feelings I suppose he has dismissed  Joseph L Heywood from Office under  the impression probably that he was too  honest a man to handle Government  funds. He sends Judges to Utah and  they make expenses by Tens of thousands  of Dollars & these Judges force the Marshal  to stand at the Back of these expenses   and the Departments refuse to pay them  & cannot conceive how it is possible that  anything should cost more in Utah  than in N. York. Bro Heywood got his  discharge today. I am about appointing  him private secretary and he hopes 
 that Uncle Sam will at least be as  polite as other men are when they  dismiss their hands—pay up    Today Dr Bernhisel Introduced me   to Mr Andrew Oliver of N. York. He asked  me many questions in relation to Utah &  seems pleased. He is a Republican of the  moderate stripe. He also introduced me  to Govr Aiken member from South Carolina    Also to Mr Cox of Kentucky a Know Nothing    The business of the House is conducted in  such noisy style that it is impossible for  me to understand half that is going on    In the Senate to day they ^were^ Discussing  a Bill for a Road from the South Pass  to Minnesota Ter. I was surprised in hearing  the debate at the ignorance of ^many of^ the Senators in  regard to the mountains & plains.    Judge Kinney called on me yesterday  and told Dr Bernhisel & myself  "he had  not asked President Pierce to appoint him  Govr of Utah. His friends had not asked for  him either. He would not permit his friends   to ask. hHe did not want the Office. The office  he now had was equally as Lucrative he could  remain at home some time and draw his  Salary without going to Utah, but if President  Pierce tendered him the appointment without   asking he would accept and go to Utah 
 alone without Troops. I can do the duties of  Governor in Utah. I want no Troops. I do  not want the Office I despise do not want   the Office when I know the whole people prefer  Govr Young and I will accept rather as a duty  I owe to the people of Utah rather than have  a man appointed who would be liable to  make trouble. Understand me if Govr  Young must be removed and I am tendered  the Office I shall acccept. He also stated   that he believed that Govr Young would be  removed. I write to you not wishing  you to publish my letter because in speaking  of men & things Individually they might  come back in a way so as to prejudice  my influence among the Devils who  have all ^got to^ be influenced to vote over ad-  mission into Bedlam or we shall have  to stay out; and last not least hurt Dr Bernhisel's  feelings" I do expect that if we had not have  been councelled in the start to confer together  and act being agreed that Dr Bernhisels non-  committal Policy would have got awfully twisted  before this time. The longer I remain here  the more thoroughly I became convinced that there   are no independent men in congress who dare  stand up for their own principles of non-intervention  at the present time or at least that I have not  become aquainted with any; I have not met  any but what seem to shudder at the idea of facing the music now.

 Saint Louis Mo Sept 1846    Elder Woodruff    Beloved Brother Your very  welcome favor of 21st August has been received  and its contents duly appreciated. Bishop Whitney  & Co. are in this city, expecting to leave for the camp in a few  days; I most cheerfuly embrace the opportunity thus offerd  of forwarding an answer to your letter.    If all the camp of Israel were ^as humble^ as you seem to be your  dificulties I am inclined to think would be but few, and they  easily settled. for my neglect in writing to you, I hope I  shall be forgaven. I will try and do better for the  future. I have enjoyed tolerable health this sumer  but there has been a good deal of sickness in this city  but not so fatle with our people as might of been  reasonably expected. The Lord has been with us and  owned the administration of his servants.    In consequence of the troubles in Nauvoo our numbers  have been greatly increased I believe that there ^are^ very  near 1,000 who profess to be Saints in this place many  of whom are very poor especially among those who have  come down from Nauvoo. since the treaty, we are taking  up subscription for them. Since beginning this letter I have  received 16 dollars for their relief have distributed some  of it and some I have loaned to those who think they  will be able to refund it. I intend to try and keep up a fund

 we crossed with a wire rope & pullies  and when we got across the river  it took 2 yoak of oxon to draw our  boat with the waggon on for a quarter  of a mile th[r]ough a slew before we could  get on dry land and the river had  overflowed so much it covered our  road for 5 miles so we had to travel  in the sage brush and rocky lavy  beds which was hard travelling & made  us quite weary when we got to Br  Ricks This new town which is  one year old covers 1120 Acres  laid out in 10 A[c]re bloks 4 lots in  a blok 2 1/2 acres in a lot, most of the  lots take up one half of the town fenced  & 70 Houses built & two canals  dug one 4 miles long & the other 3 1/4 mles  and both 10 feet wide on the bottom this  Rexbugh town has a field of 1500  acres fenced & 500 acres in wheat today  well I never saw so much work done  in one year by the same number of people 
 in my life there are 10 other settlements in  this stake they number one 1500  people and increasing evry day I do not  think I ever saw as good a hearding &   farming county as this in these mountia[n]s  for 30 Miles all around thes settlements  the Hills and vallies are all covered with  grass a foot high.

 On Monday we cross the Teton  River on a raft to go and hold a   Meeting in the Town of Wilford  you know I am fond of fishing but  the river now here are half a mile  wide there is but few places we can  get to the bank with hard work we  have caught about to a dozen trout  seen Deer and a dozen Antelope but  I am here the wrong time of the year to  fish or hunt. I do not know yet  what time we shall go home but  I think before long I expect the lumber  for that fenc will be delivered before  I get home & I hope I shall get a  letter from Asahel when I get home  you may keep the envellop containing  this letter as a specemin of  penmanship of H.

 Terre Haute Sept 27th 1837    Brother Wilford    I received your very kind and interesting  Letter dated Rowley Mass. July 25th in its proper  season and as you invited my correspondence with you  at Scarborough I cannot longer deny myself the  pleasure of writing you. In the perusal of the account  of your visit among the friends of our youth I assure  you I can appreciate the emotions by which you must  have been inspired and I should think myself most  highly favored to be permitted to enjoy with you  such an occasion. When I think of "My own dear  native land" So many and such varied associations  crowd into my mind that I can hardly determine  whether I should realise more pleasure or pain  from a visit. I have many objects of attaction and  endearing interest there but there is one before  which all others lose their force it is found  in the magic term "My Sistre"! I have many  friends who are very dear to me and upon whose  memory I often dwell with great delight, yet  my dear brother must forgive me when I say  that the presence of my only sister in my  thoughts drives every other object from my  reccollection. I sometimes fear she is too much  the idol of my heart but I pray God that  she be not doomed to be smitten in judgment  to me. 
 It must have been gratifying to you to meet  so much encouragements in your ministry among   the bigotry and superstion of Farmington, and  believe me, brother, tho, I am a wayward child  I always rejoice at the success of a humble  ministration of the gospel and I am proud  to think I have a brother who is not ashamed  to proclaim the truth where so little honor  is to be expected as in one his own country  I am not ambitious to have my brothers become  "able divines of the day" skilled in all the  subtleties of the craft but I shall ever be happy  to learn that they are skilful dividers of  the word of truth and mighty through  God to the pulling down of the strong holds  of Satan. I have just received letter from  Mother. She writes that the Book of Morman  a copy of which I left at home is in much  demand there it is loaned out all of the   time and several applications are in advance  for the favor. I was very sorry that it  became necessary for our people to now  return to T... but it was perhaps exp-  edient and I hope will prove for the best  She writes that all are well and that  they are doing as well as they had reason  to expect Eunice is expected to go home as  soon as her school is closed. 
 You talk of going to Missouri this fall but   say not a word about visiting me! I cannot think  dear W. that you can be so unkind as to fail  visiting me this fall and I shall insist upon your  making Terre Haute a point on your route  to Mo. I should be delighted to see you and  Sister in Law. And I now promise myself the  pleasure before many weeks. I cannot indeed  promise you much entertainment here nor do  I imagine you be much pleased with me for  to tell you the truth I am getting to be a  disagreeable thing and do not improve much  by age, but then, I am your brother [page torn]  and this will be some little excuse for you  to take a little trouble to see me, besides I  know your weakness and from this knowledge  am assured you will take a little pride  in presenting me to your Phebe, who cannot  be otherwise than what your good taste  and judgment warrants me in presuming.    I wrote your at Farmington sometime ago  and hope you will get the Letter.    I hope you will write me often.    With kind wishes to Mrs Woodruff I remain  , dear brother    Very Truly Yours  Asahel H Woodruff    Wilford Woodruff

 copy    Toquerville Washington Co UT May 5 1889    Pres Wilford Woodruff Dear Brother having returned  from working in the St George Temple for my Dead  I asked Brother McCallister a question that he did not feel  at liberty to answer But wished me to state the question  to you, just as I had stated it to him, which is a follows  I went back to England on a mission in the year 1877  and while there preached the Gosple to my Sister and  her family and Baptised several of them, all the rest  believing and preached to her the true order of marriage  and adoption of her Children her Husband was a  drinking man and often acted bad to her so that  she would not have him for Eternity but wished  to be sealed to me, when she died as she was taken  very bad with dropsey and did not Expect Ever  to come to Zion. I told her I did not know how that  would be. Such things had been done but I did  not know how it would be again. Well then if  that cannot be done I want you to have me sealed  to your son Mohonri M Steele (he was then there on   a mission) and my Children adopted to him and me  and left the matter in my hands to see to it She died  shortly after I left England and I have had her Endow-  ments attended to for her but nothing more  Now dear Brother your answer to this question  would settle the matter and by so doing would  would greatly oblidge your Brother in the Gospel    John Steele

 Sabbath Morning February 23, 1833    Brother  Asahel    I received your line under date of Jan 2nd,  & was gratified to learn that you meet with good success  in your temporal undertakings. As the business your are employed in  appears to prove profitable no doubt but you will do well to persevere  in it And I would heartily except of your generous offer in joining  you in canvassing two or three of these western counties if circumstances  would permit but I stand in need of more information respecting the  subject before I can decide. You know Brother it is expensive travling  5 or 6 months without any incomes & now I would like to know who  your employers are & whether they reside in York state or Connecticut  & how long we must wait for our pay. Was if those who get the subscribers  can review pay of the publishers before the Books are distributed I should think  it best to get subscribers & let others distribute, but I conclude this is not  the case I expect they advance no funds untill the books are distributed  & money collected, & if this is the case probably it would be the safest to  distribute to your own subscribers then you will be sure of your pay.  There is business sufficient for three of us at holm the coming season  but perhaps not to that profit that it would be for me to go into the Book  business. We have some payments coming due in the spring which probably will  take what money we shall have. If I could procure a little money if it was  not more than $20.00 I think I would take a [trunk] with you in the Spring  which is fast hastening. But at all events I think you will be well to take those  Counties you spoke of & if you could get Oswego County I could help  you canvass parts of that without much expense, as it is at holm.  Whether I have any part as lat in this matter or not I hope the  business will continue to prove as favorable to you as it now  presents itself And when you receive this line I wish you would  write to me again & let me know the whole particulars of the business  then I can know better how to calculate. I would like to know  who your employers are & if those who get the subscribers must distribute the  Books & how long we must wait for our pay &c. I would like to  Join you in the business if I can procure money to pay my  expenses untill I can receieve sumthing for my labour. I dont  think of any thing ^more^ connected with this subject of importance to write.    We have written to Brother Thompson & directed our  letter to Farmington stating that we wished him to come out & work  with us as soon as he could settle his business in the spring & if you  should see him let him know of it as he may have been imployed  in some other place through the winter & not receieved it    I shall live in hopes  of seeing you in the spring if you visit this section of country    NB (I wish to be remembered to all enquiring friends Willford) 
 I am glad to hear that you are enjoying so comfortable temporal &  Spiritual health. With respect to myself I have enjoyed good health through  the winter excepting a few turns of the cholic & occasionally a rhoumatic  bite but this is not to be wondered at for I should think it would give any  man the cholic to load & draw as many logs as I have thi^s^ winter from  the shores of Lake Ontario in all kinds of weather however I have got  allmost through with it a few days more will if prospered and a winters  job. Azmon has been employed most of the week past in  sleding lumber to Mexico about six miles which he exchanges for  household furniture & farming tools we can exchange lumber for any   kind of store goods But I have allready gone more than a Sabbath  days Journey in temporal affairs.    With regard to spiritual things things conserning  the Kingdom of God & my own soul I would say it would be  impious not to acknowledge the goodness of God in preserving my life  to the present period finally what a long suffering & patient waiting God we  are dealing with at times when I look at my unfaithfulness, unbelief,  slow to obey prone to wander & to do evil, heart buried in the rubbish of the   world while wasteing my Masters goods I feel ready to exclaim what is man  that Thou art mindful of as the son of man that Thou visitest him. But  I think I have a desire that God will help me to arise & trim my lamp  that I may be more prepared for his comeing for he is near even at the door  Brother if you have free access to a Throne of grace remember me in your  petitions pray that I may know the mind & will of God in Christ Jesus conserning  me I have had my mind more than usually impressed for a few days  past with the subject of the signs of the times this probably was caused by a visit  from a servant or prophet of the Lord which called at our house his  commishion is to the house of Israel to warn them to repentance.  he professes to belong to no persuasion of people ownly a servent of the living  God he goes & comes at the biding of his Master & if he is correct in his prophecy  which I cannot doubt (for it agrees with the word of God) we live in the most  important event of the world. He says Babylon now is to fall and the cup of  Gods indignation is now prepared for her & she must drink it & all who do not  come out of her must now fall with her he tells what time we live in & what  is now to fall upon the inhabitants of the earth who have not the mark in their  foreheads. He allso sayes that the destroying Angels have had their commishion &  now gone forth to slay and according to his word great slaughter is nigh at  the doors. he appears most like a true prophet of any I ever conversed with  My Allmighty God prepare us for evry event & help us to live in such a manner  that we may be accounted worthy to escape the Just Judgements of God which  are to fall on this generation    From Your Brother W Woodruff 
 ELDERS' JOURNAL  OF THE CHURCH OF LATTER DAY SAINTS.    VOL I. No. 1.]- KIRTLAND, OHIO, OCTOBER, 1837. -[Whole No. 1.    North Lat, 44. Long. 69, 10. Vin-  alhaven, Fox Islands, Monday, Sept.   18th, 1837.    To JOSEPH SMITH Jr. AND THE  CHURCH OF LATTER DAY SAINTS IN  KIRTLAND GREETING:    Dear Saints of God,   whom we love of a truth for the truth'   sake that dwelleth in you, and we pray   God that it may abide with you forev-  er: As we are called to stand upon   the Islands of the sea, in defence of the   truth and for the word of God and the  testimony of Jesus Christ. We are   under the necessity of making use of   our pen, to give you an account of our   labors in the ministry since we left   Kirkland, as we cannot at present speak   to you face to face. We left Kirtland   May 31st, and took Steamboat at Fair-  port in company with Elder Milton   Holmes, to go forth to labor in the   vineyard as the Lord should direct.  After calling on the Saints in Jefferson   Co. N. Y. we arrived at Sackett's   Harbour and took Steamboat on the  6th of June for Upper Canada and on  the 8th arived at Brother Artemus   Judd's. And on the 10th, had the hap-  py privilege of setting in conference   with John E. Page, James Blakes-  lee, and a number other elders, and a   large congregation of Saints. And   we were blessed with a very interesting   time. After spending several days   with them we took the parting hand   with these beloved friends and pro-  ceeded on our journey for the East in   company with elder John Goodson, and   others bound for England. We took   the parting hand with them at Schenec-  tady, and arrived at the Canaan church   in Connecticut, visited the church a   few days. Here elder M. Holmes   took his departure for Mass. and we   went to Colebrook, visited different parts   of the town and held eight meetings,   from thence to Canton and held a meet-  ing in the village hall in Collinsville.  As we commenced speaking several  began to beat their drums at the doors   which made much confusion. This is   the only disturbance we have had since   we left Kirtland. We next visited   Avon, where we held four meetings   and many came out to hear and mani-  fest a spirit of inquiry. And elder   Woodruff had the privilege of leading   three of his kinfolk into the waters of   baptism. And had not the Spirit call-  ed us away to perform a greater work,   we should have had no difficulty in es-  tablishing a branch of the church in   that place. A family where we tarried   but one night, and taught them the   things of the kingdom, believed our tes-  timony, and after our departure, two   of the household followed us 15 miles   to receive baptism at our hands, but we   were gone, and they truly believed it   to be a day of warning and not of ma-  ny words. We also visited Farming-  ton and held one meeting in the Meth-  odist meeting house, and preached to   an attentive congregation who wished   to hear more concerning the great work   of God. We left Farmington on the 20   of July, for Mass. and after visiting   the Bradford church, and after preach-  ing several times with them, we pro-  ceeded on our journey to Saco, Maine,   where we spent several days with the   church and friends. But duty urging   us forward to lift the warning voice to   those that had not heard the sound of   the gospel, we then went to the city of   Portland. We there took the Steam-  er Bangor on the 19 of August, to speed   us on our way to the Islands of the sea,   they landed us at Owls head at the set-  ting of the sun: But how to get con-  veyance to the Islands we knew not,   we retired to a grove and offered up   our thanks unto God for his mercies   and asked him to open our way before   us; we returned to the Inn and soon   found some men that were going near   the Islands that night, they said they   would land us if we chose to take pas-  sage with them. We accordingly went   on board, they hoisted sail and landed   us on North Fox Island, Vinalhaven,   at 2 o'clock Sunday morning, August   20th. It was with peculiar feelings   and sensations that we began to walk   forth upon one of the Islands of the sea   which was wrapped in the sable shades   of night, whose waters, had never cov-  ered a soul for the remission of their   sins after the order of the gospel, and   which soil had never been press-  ed by the foot steps of an elder of Is-  rael. We were strangers, pilgrims,   and almost pennyless. But we had 
 TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:    THIS Certifies that Willford Woodruff has been received  into the church of the Latter Day Saints, organized on the sixth of April, in the year of our Lord, one thou-  sand, eight hundred, and thirty, and has been ordained an elder according to the rules and regulations of said  church, and is duly authorized to preach the gospel, agreeably to the authority of that office.    From the satisfactory evidence which we have of his good moral character, and his zeal for the cause of right-  eousness, and diligent desire to persuade men to forsake evil and embrace truth, we confidently recommend  him to all candid and upright people as a worthy member of society.    We, therefore, in the name, and by the authority of this church, grant unto this our worthy brother in the  Lord, this letter of commendation as a proof of our fellowship and esteem: praying for his success and pros-  perity in our Redeemer's cause.    Given by the direction of a conference of the elders of said church, assembled in Kirtland, Geauga county,  Ohio, the third day of March, in the year of our Lord one thousand, eight hundred, and thirty six.

 come on the Lords business, we believ-  ed him faithful that had promised, and   we felt willing to trust in his name,   we soon came to a house, where we   were received and we retired to rest.   We arose in the morning made ourselves   known as servants of the Lord, we in-  quired if there was any religion or   priests on the Island; we were inform-  ed that there was a Baptist priest, a   small church and a meeting house at   the center of the Island. The town of   Vinalhaven includes both North and   South Fox Islands: Pop. 1800. The   inhabitants are generally wealthy, in-  telligent, industrious, generous and   hospitable to strangers. North Island   is 9 miles long, and 2 wide, pop. 800.   South Island is 10 miles long, and 5   wide, pop. 1000 &c. As it was Sab-  bath morning there was to be preach-  ing in the meeting house, we conclu-  ded to attend considering it a proper   place to introduce the gospel. When   we arived at the place, meeting had   commenced, the deacon came to the   door and we informed him that we   were servants of the Lord, that we had   a message for the people and wished   to be heard, the deacon informed the   priest that we were preachers of the   gospel. He invited us into the stand   and gave out an appointment for us at  5 o'clock P.M. After the priest had   closed his discourse he invited us to his   house during the intermission. We   presented him the book of Mormon,   he appeared friendly and said he should   like to read it. We met according to   appointment and preached to them the   first principles of the gospel. We then   gave out appointments for the four fol-  lowing evenings to be held at the sev-  eral school houses on the Island. The   people came out in great numbers and   heard with attention and manifested   much anxiety, and in fourteen days   we held nineteen meetings. The Bap-  tist priest became alarmed seeing that   his craft was in danger; and fearing   that if he held his peace all Fox Islands   would believe on our words, accor-  dingly he strove to use his influence   against us, but without effect as you   may judge on learning the fact that on   Sunday the 27th while we met with a   congregation, he had not so much as   one to meet with him at his usual place  of worship, for the excitement was so   great that the members of his church   and deacon, were attending our meet-  ings and inviting us to visit them, and   inquiring into these things. The Lord   clothed us with his Spirit, and we were   enabled to stand up and boldly declare   those things that are commanded us.  And the sound thereof soon reached   the neighboring Islands and some of the   inhabitants soon hoisted their sails to   convey them over the waters to hear   the tidings for themselves. On Sun-  day the 3rd of Sept. we preached to a   large congregation assembled together   from these Islands, at the close of our   meeting we opened a door for baptism,   and a respectable sea captain and his   wife offered themselves as candidates,   we then assembled where there was   much water and after offering up our   prayers unto God, we then lead them   down into the sea and baptized them   and we returned rejoicing. On Mon-  day following we visited the South Is-  land to set before them the truths of the   everlasting gospel. We held five   meetings, the people came out by hun-  dreds, to hear and filled the school-  houses to overflowing.    Notwithstanding the anxiety of the   people to hear more upon this impor-  tant subject, yet we were under the   necessity of returning to the North Is-  land, to attend an appointment on Sun-  day, accordingly we met and preached   to the people and opened a door for   baptism and another sea Captain and a   young lady came forward and we re-  paired to the sea shore and baptized   them, and on Tuesday following, we   administered the ordinance of baptism   unto three others.    A Methodist priest on the South Is-  land fearing whereunto these things   would grow, came over to the Island   where we were baptizing and made   friends with the Baptist priest (like   Herod and Pilate) and called a meet-  ing, we attended [##Luke 23:12##]. The Methodist priest   arose and commenced warm hostilities   against the book of Mormon, and our   principles, we took minutes of his dis-  course that we might be correct in an-  swering him. As he could not bring   proof from the word of God against   our principles, and in order to make   an impression upon the minds of his   hearers against the work; he took the   book of Mormon in his hand, and with   an out stretched arm declared that he   feared none of the judgments of God   that would come upon him for rejecting   that book as the word of God.

 he closed his meeting we arose and   rectified some of his wide mistakes in   his presence before the congregation,   and informed the people if they would   meet next Sabbath at the meeting   house we would answer every ebjection   that had been presented against the   book of Mormon and our principles du-  ring the meeting. And last Sabbath   we met a congregation of several hun-  dred at the meeting house, assembled   together from the different Islands, and   we arose in their midst, and redeemed   our pledge by answering every objec-  tion that had been brought against the   book of Mormon, or our principles.  After meeting we repaired to the water   and again administered the ordinance   of baptism. The Baptist priest is no   less busy than his Methodist brother, for   while one is in the pulpit declaring to   the people, that the principles of the   book of Mormon are saping the very   foundation of our churches and holy   religion; the other is gone over to the   main land calling upon his Baptist   brethren, saying come over and help   us lest we fall. But cursed is man   that trusteth in man or maketh flesh his   arm saith the Lord God. O ye priests   of Baal your cry is in vain, the God of   Israel has set his hand the second time   to recover his people. The stone has   began to roll, and will soon become a   mountain and fill the whole earth. The   Lord is calling his church out of the   wilderness, with her gifts and graces   and restoring her judges as at the first.   God has chosen the weak things of   this world to confound the wise, and   with them he will rend your kingdoms,   that the wisdom of your wise men may   perish, and the understanding of yonr   prudent men may be hid. The cry of   the Saints is ascending into the ears of   the Lord of Sabaoth for Ephraim.  The horns of Joseph are begining to   push the people together. The apos-  tles of the Lamb of God are bearing the   keys of his kingdom on the shores of   Europe. Yea and the mighty Captains   of the ships at sea, are receiving the   gospel of Jesus Christ; and enjoying   its power, and the call of many from   distant Islands, has already entered   our ears; O come and preach to us,   we have sent a book of Mormon over   the billows of the great deep, to teach   those that are at sea. And the word   and work are propelled by the arm of   JEHOVAH. And the weapon that is   formed against Zion shall soon be   broken. And he that raises his puny   arm against it, is fighting against God   and shall soon mourn because of his   loss. We say these things are true as   God liveth, and the Spirit beareth rec-  ord and the record is true, and ven-  geance will be speedily executed upon   an evil work in these last days, there-  fore, O Babylon thy fall is sure.    Although we have not baptized but   few on these Islands, yet there is hun-  dreds believing and many are almost   ready to enter into the kingdom, the   calls are numerous from the neighbor-  ing Islands, and also from the main   land, for us to come and preach unto   them, and tell them words whereby   they may be saved from the pending   judgments that await the world. There   are fifteen or twenty neighboring Islands   that are inhabited, some of them con-  tain a population of several thousand.   And while the fields are white, we   view the harvest great in this country:   and the laborers few. And while we   are faithfully laboring day and night   for the salvation of his people; we ask   an interest in your prayers, O ye   Saints of the most high God. O ye   elders of Israel will ye not go forth in-  to the vineyard and help wind up the   scene of this generation which sits in   darkness and in the shadow of death.    O ye ministers of our God, if we alto-  gether hold our peace at this time, shall   we not suffer loss when the Lord raises   up deliverance unto Israel. But for   Zion's sake let us not hold our peace,   and for Jerusalem's sake let us not rest   until the light thereof go forth as bright-  ness and salvation as a lamp that burn-  eth.    That we all may keep the patience   and faith of the Saints and see that no   man take our crown, is the prayer of   your brethren in the Lord Jesus.    WILLFORD WOODRUFF,  JOHNATHAN H. HALE.

 TIMES AND SEASONS.  "Truth will prevail."  Vol. III. No. 12.]-  CITY OF NAUVOO, ILL. APRIL 15, 1842. -[Whole No. 48.    For the Times and Seasons.  SABBATH SCENE IN NAUVOO;  March 20th 1842.    A large assembly of Saints gathered together   at the place of meeting at an early hour, to   hear a discourse delivered by President Joseph   Smith, upon the subject of Baptism. A child   of Mr. Windsor P. Lyons being deseased, the   body of which lay before the assembly, called   forth many remarks from the speaker upon the   subject of death and the resurrection, which   were in the highest degree interesting and   edifying, as were also his remarks upon the   subject of baptism.    The following is a brief synopsis of some of   the items delivered by the speaker.    President Smith read the ##Revelations 14|14th chap. of Rev.##  and said,    "We have again the warning voice sounded   in our midst which shows the uncertainty of   human life; and in my leisure moments I have   meditated upon the subject, and asked the   question, Why it is that infants, innocent chil-  dren are taken away from us? especially those   that seem to be the most intelligent and inter-  esting? and the strongest reasons that present   themselves to my mind are these: This world is   a very wicked world; and it is a proverb that   the 'world grows weaker and wiser' if it is   the case, the world grows more wicked and   corrupt. In the early ages of the world, a righte-  ous man, and a man of God, and of intelligence,   had a better chance to do good, to be believed  and received, than at the present day; but in   these days such a man is much opp[os]ed and   persecuted by most of the inhabitants of the   earth; and he has much sorrow to pass through   here, the Lord takes many away even in in-  fancy that they may escape the envy of man,  and the sorrows and evils of this present world;  they were too pure, too lovely, to live on earth;   therefore if rightly considered instead of   mourning we have reason to rejoice as they   are delivered from evil, and we shall soon have  them again.    "What chance is there for infidelity when   we are parting with our friends almost daily?  None at all. The infidel will grasp at every   straw for help until death stares him in the   face, and then his infidelity takes its flight, for   the realities of the eternal world are resting   upon him in mighty power; and when every   earthly support and prop fails him, he then   sensibly feels the eternal truths of the immor-  tality of the soul. We should take warning   and not wait for the death bed to repent, as   we see the infant taken away by death, so   may the youth and middle aged, as well as   the infant suddenly be called into eternity.  Let this then prove as a warning to all, not to   procrastinate repentance, or wait till a death  bed; for it is the will of God that man   should repent, and serve him in health, and in  the strength, and power of his mind, in order   to secure his blessing; and not wait until he   is called to die. Also the doctrine of Baptiz-  ing children, or sprinkling them, or they must   welter in hell is a doctrine not true, not sup-  ported in Holy writ, and is not consistent with   the character of God. All children are re-  deemed by the blood of Jesus Christ, and the   moment that children leave this world they are   taken to the bosom of Abraham. The only   difference between the old and young dying,   is, one lives longer in heaven, and eternal light   and glory than the other, and is freed a little   sooner from this miserable wicked world.  Notwithstanding all this glory, we for a mo-  ment lose sight of it, and mourn the loss; but   we do not mourn as those without hope.    "My intention was, to have spoken upon   the subject of baptism, but having a case of   death before us I thought proper to refer to   that subject. I will now however say a few   words upon baptism, as I intended. God has   made certain decrees which are fixed, and   immovable, for instance; God set the sun, the   moon, and the stars in the heavens; and gave   them their laws, conditions, and bounds which   they cannot pass, except by his commandments;   they all move in perfect harmony in their   sphere, and order, and are as lights, wonders,   and signs unto us. The sea also has its bounds   which it cannot pass. God has set many signs   on the earth, as well as in the heavens, for in-  stance; the oak of the forest, the fruit of the   tree, the herb of the field; all bear a sign that   seed hath been planted there; for it is a decree   of the Lord that every tree, plant, and herb,   bearing seed, should bring forth of its kind, and   cannot come forth after any other law, or prin-  ciple. Upon the same principle do I contend   that baptism is a sign ordained of God, for the   believer in Christ to take upon himself in order   to enter into the kingdom of God, "for except   ye are born of water, and of the spirit ye can-  not enter into the kingdom of God," [##John 3:5##] saith the   Saviour. It is a sign, and commandment which 
 God has set for man to enter into his Kingdom.  Those who seek to enter in any other way will  seek in vain; and God will not receive them,  neither will the angels acknowledge their   works as accepted; for they have not obeyed  the ordinances, nor attended to the signs   which God ordained for the salvation of man,   to prepare him for; and give him a title to a   celestial glory; and God has decreed that all   who will not obey his voice shall not escape the   damnation of hell. What is the damnation of   hell? to go with that society who have not   obeyed his commands. Baptism is a sign to   God, to Angels, and to heaven that we do the   will of God: and there is no other way beneath   the heavens whereby God hath ordained for   man to come to him, to be saved, and enter into   the kingdom of God, except faith in Jesus   Christ; repentance, and baptism for the remis-  sion of sins, and any other course is in vain;  then you have the promise of the gift of the   Holy Ghost. What is the sign of the healing   of the sick? the laying on of hands is the sign,   or way marked out by James; and the custom   of the ancient Saints as ordered by the Lord;   and we can not obtain the blessing by pur-  suing any other course, except the way marked   out by the Lord.    What if we should attempt to get the gift of   the Holy Ghost through any other means, ex-  cept the signs, or way which God hath ap-  pointed? should we obtain it? certainly not;   all other means would fail. The Lord says do   so, and so, and I will bless, so, and so.    There are certain key-words, and signs belong-  ing to the priesthood, which must be observed   in order to obtain the blessing, the sign of   Peter was to repent, and be baptized for the   remission of sins, with the promise of the gift   of the Holy Ghost: and in no other way is the  gift of the Holy Ghost obtained. There is a   difference between the Holy Ghost, and the   gift of the Holy Ghost. Cornelius received the   Holy Ghost before he was baptized; which   was the convincing power of God unto him of  the truth of the gospel; but he could not receive  the gift of the Holy Ghost until after he was  baptized. Had he not taken this sign, or or-  dinance upon him, the Holy Ghost which con-  vinced him of the truth of God, would have   left him. Until he obeyed these ordinances   and received the gift of the Holy Ghost, by   the laying on of hands, according to the order   of God, he could not have healed the sick, or   commanded an evil spirit to come out of a man,  and it obey him; for the spirits might say unto   him, as they did to the sons of Sceva; 'Paul   we know; and Jesus we know, but who are   ye!' [##Acts 19:15##] It mattereth not whether we live long or   short on the earth after we come to a knowl-  edge of these principles and obey them unto the   end. I know that all men will be damned if   they do not come in the way which he hath   opened; and this is the way marked out by the   word of the Lord.    "As concerning the resurrection I will mere-  ly say that all men will come from the grave as   they lie down, whether old or young, there will   not be 'added unto their stature one cubit;'  neither taken from it; all will be raised by   the power of God, having spirit in their bodies,   and not blood. Children will be enthroned in   the presence of God, and the Lamb; with bodies   of the same stature that they had on earth; hav-  ing been redeemed by the blood of the Lamb,  they will there enjoy the fulness of that light  glory, and intelligence which is prepared in  the Celestial kingdom: 'Blessed are the dead   who die in the Lord; for they rest from their   labors and their works do follow them.' [##Revelations 14:13##]    The speaker before closing called upon the   assembly before him, to humble themselves in   faith before God, and in mighty prayer and   fasting to call upon the name of the Lord,  until the elements were purified over our heads,  and the earth sanctified under our feet; that   the inhabitants of this city may escape the power   of disease and pestilence, and the destroyer that   rideth upon the face of the earth; and that the   Holy Spirit of God may rest upon this vast   multitude. At the close of the meeting Presi-  dent Smith informed the congregation that he  should attend to the ordinance of Baptism in   the river near his house, at 2 o'clock; and at   the appointed hour the bank of the Mississippi   was lined with a multitude of people, and Pres-  ident Joseph Smith went forth into the river   and baptized with his own hands 80 persons,   for the remission of their sins; and what added   joy to the scene was, that the first person bap-  tized was Mr. L. D. Wasson, a nephew of   Mrs Emma Smith; the first of her kindred   that have embraced the fulness of the Gospel.  At the close of this interesting scene the ad-  ministrator lifted up his hands towards heaven,  and implored the blessing of God to rest upon   the people; and truly the spirit of God did rest  upon the multitude, to the joy and consolation   of our hearts. After baptism the congregation   again repaired to the grove, near the Temple,  to attend to the ordinance of confirmation;   and, notwithstanding, President Smith had  spoken in the open air to the people, and stood   in the water and baptized about 80 persons,   about 50 of those baptized received their con-  firmation under his hands, in the after part of 
 the day. While this was progressing great   numbers were being baptized in the font.    Those who wish for further information con-  cerning the scenes of the Sabbath in Nauvoo,   or any other day in the week would do well to   "come and see."    W. WOODRUFF. 
 Farmington Nov 28 1845    Dear Son Wilford    It is now Thanksgiving eve with us, & we  have been waiting in earnest expectation for a number of weeks to  hear from you again. I should have written you eer this, had it   not been for the consequent ersults of the late trouble at the west zvivz   the determinations of the church to remove to a more hospitable clime  &c &c, & as we your Parents verily supposed, their son Wilford would  never engage in this great enterprize without first visiting ^his native^ land  because firstly, they were conscious that he not only had children in  his native Land but also some property there which they concluded  he must of necessity attend to before he left these united States,  & secondly that he had Parents there who had for some time past  been looking to him as one who, in some not very distand  period would  probably be able & willing to assist them in gathering with the Saints  & their other dear children who had gone thither & whom they much  wished to see, & that now as the church had determined upon a remove  across the Rocky Mountains to California surely they thought it  could not be long before he would be returning to the West & make  calculations to call on them to stir them up & assist them in preparing  for the great event viz to aid them on to the West & give them a little  time to rest & visit their Children untill the opening of the spring  when they wocould all both Parents & Children be prepared to take their  final leave with the church & in the strength of Israels God engag  in the Rocky Mou scaling the flinty Mountains I thought soon after  we had the account that the church would all remove, & told your  father, that I would write as it was high time we had, but that it was  not certain but that you might have had the news sooner, as soon a[s]  we & that you might be returning before a Letter could get to you &  knowing your zeal in things pertaining to the Kingdom  of God we finally thot best to omit writing you, your father had  often said I wonder Wilford dont write us or, that we do not  recieve a communication from him, if he is coming on this fall  & this, we surely thot you would do & when your father said, I dont  know how W. will be visit for the means to assist us in going  the answer was at hand, viz that I thought & felt that as he had  from time to time assisted the Saints especially when in England  to come to America that that they might go to the Land of Zion  & that now, as he would in all probability desire to help his  Parents & other relatives to go with the church that the Lord wold  open & prepare the way before him by granting him means  sufficient to accomplish the desired object. Indeed your father  & myself have fell much on the subject I can say that it has looked  very pleasent to me to think of going even across the Rocky Mountains 
 Indeed I have had a great choice in view of going by Land & your  Father said, before the trouble at the west after reading a descripti-  on of California that there was no place in the world where he  should like to go as well as to California but, enough of this strain    We have rec'd a Letter from our Children at Nauvoo, to day, & it was the first  we have had since their trouble, & it was with a trembling hand, that I broke  the seal, yet we learned therefrom that they were all in the Land of the  living, & in somewhat comfortable circumstance, yet the contents of the   same were such in general as to sicken our hearts & give us the  worst of feelings but what, you will ask, did it contain. Why, in the  first place our children spoke of the removal of the church as tho  they had no part nor lot in the matter, & principily because they had  no means to assist themselves to go & no information that anyone would  lend a helping hand to assist them, there is something Wilford that  looks quite dark to us in this affair & there seems to be a good deal of  it too if we can judge anything from their communication & here  arises a question in our hearts which seems at this time hard to be solved  viz, can these things be of God, but now Wilford you will say, Mother I  must be crazy, but I can tell you Son W. that for near thirty years your  Mothers mind, or the exercises of the same have in almost every instance  where any thing of a serious nature was about to transpire have proved  to ^be^ as a preface to the final result & now I now not how to understand the  excercises of mind I have had of late, when contrasted with present appear-  ances, our Children write that you have been counciled to go Direct from  England to California. If a thunbolt had racked our house I should  not have been more astounded than upon reading this declaration. I have  ever believed since I became aquainted with spiritual things that the  work of the Lord never clashed, but here is something that looks so  much like it, that I am filled with wonder & astonishment, now I  would ask one question or two, has not President Young been made  aquainted with the fact, that you had Parents who were in the decline  of life, & [w]ho of course looked to you as their all as it were especially as  to the privige of gathering with the Saints & that altho they have other  sons who would gladly receive their society & do all that lay that  lay in their power to render them every necessary assistance but that   after all, the moment they should  go to dwell with or near by their   sons they would be constrained to give up their religion or the  principles of the Gospel unless they should conclude to live in one  continual conflict as have the Saints in Illinois I say has Presid-  dent Young been made aquainted with these facts as also that you  have an only Sister residing in Nauvoo, who has for a number of   years past been in a very peculiarly afflicted state not only in reg-  ard to her own health but also on the account of the misfortunes  of her companion in life, & consequently would stand in special  need of some little assistance from her Brother in such an import-  ant crisis as the present but if this has not been the case It does appear 
 [sideways text] Why Son Wilford what a predicament your Parents  & their friends would be in suppose you should actually  go as we have had intimation. I cannot think, it will be  so, if for no other reason than this, that your Parents  could never again say, that they had not been conf-  ounded while endeavouring to trust in the Lord god of  Israel, & the scriptures tell us that such shall never be  confounded in worlds without end, now I do not suppose  that if indeed President Young has given such council  to you that it proves that he is not ordinarly possessed of  as much wisdom as any ^other^ person on the earth, but rather  his having so much business to attend to did not think to [end of sideways text]    enquire whether you had ^not^ Parents & other  friends whom it would be your duty  to see to on this important occasion, but  the special predicament I illerded to  would be this, that we your Parents   would not either be with the church  nor get to our children at Nauvoo, nor they  to us, because they would not be able to do  of themselves alone. It does actually seem  the most strange thing in the world  that since you are the only Male member  in our family who has any connection  with this church that the minds of the   Twelve have ^not^ had a consciouslyness of the  responsibility is resting upon you in  regard to your somewhat numerous frie-  nds for Indeed had your Father a suf-  ficent supply of means to help us on  the journey still, you know we should   need your aid, & as you are so well acq-  uainted with travelling, & your father  so little, but I have filled my sheet you  see & some over.

 Terre Haute Dec 10th 1837    Dear brother    You enquire in your last whether I  get the "Latter Dayy Saints" from Kirtland. I do and  am obliged for the favor but to whom I am indebted I do  not know unless yourself I have read some of the com-  munications in the "Elders Journal" with a good deal of   interest but I must have leave to say that I do not   admire the style and spirit of the Letter from England  particularly that part which related to the pious devotion  of brother Kemball to his wife and children and Jesus  Christ. I do not perceive any necessary connection in idea  between the crucifixion of JOur Savior and the welfare  of ones wife and children and why the latter clause  was added I cannot conceive unless to prevent the  jealousy of his wife.    It is very seldom that I get Letters from home the latest  however render accounts of good health and general  prosperity I believe the situation of our family in  Farmington is more agreeable than before the sojourn  in Colebrook. Mother and Eunice express their  satisfaction with the advantages of good society which  they enjoy and I immagine they improve it better  than they formerly did. They write that they receive  every desireable attention.    You will recollect that I was interrupted in my last, in  the pursuit of an interesting subject, by an "inexpressible"  but I am happy to assure you that no harm was done or   other effect produced than the Excitement of a few   sensations which soon wore off leaving me cool and calm.  But to return—I was speaking of the confusion 
 produced in my mind by your mention of the change  in Sister Eunice. If she was not our only sister or  if I was less sensitive or less susceptible of the warmer  sensibilities of human nature I should probably never have  occasion to allude to my sister in refference to any change  in me. There is indeed a change in me since you saw me  but in some respects it is not such a change as you   would naturally expect to find. In that particular   respect in which I have not advanced to that state ^tone^ of   character which you would expect and to which I  shall refer you. I trace the cause to my deep  defvotion to my sister—the interest I have feellt in  her—and my great ansxiety for her. Instead of an  advance with my years to the deportment of manhood  and to the pursuits and tastes of ripen years I am  more childish in feeling and deportment than when  you saw me last. It appears to me that trifles which  would be objects of desire at the age of twelve afford  me as much gratification as at that period of my life  and in the choice of companions I am never so well  pleased as in the company of boys and girls.    In selecting my female associates I hardly ever choose  those over 12 or 14 years for past that age they  are in my estimation past the age of lovliness  perfect loveliness. And to think of paying my  court to a young Lady within 3 or 4 years of my  own age would seem an absurdity which I could  scarcely surmount. If I have a coat at the Tailors  it is as much an object of desire with me to see it  completed as with a boy to get a new Hat. And    [sideways text] I have not demonstrated very clearly my premises, that my character [end of sideways text] 
 when any new tho, unimportant arrangement is   accomplished in my business I am as much elated  as is the same boy when he gets permission to spend  a week at his uncles in the city. And if a girl  of 13 does not return my tenderness (meekness?)  my passions rage like a burning volcano. The  reason of all which I believe may be found in my  ardent devotion to my sister. If for the last five years  I have had a desire to live—to prosper—to acquire  reputation—wealth and respectability the exciting  impulse has been my regard for her. I have  lived for her—I have toiled for her—and for  her only have I struggled against the  adversities of fortune—that she might be  blessed—that in me she might find succour  and support. She has dwelt continually in  my mind has occupied my first thoughts  and when in my happier moments I have thought  myself blessed—this cloud that has soonest  spread over my joy has been the reflection that  she could not share with me my happiness   The image of my sister which has so often been  pictured to my imagination has been that of the  girl of 13 which that I left at my fathers house  I have never been able to fancy her in any other  character than that of the little girl I used to lead  about by the hand. I have loved her as such  and it is to that image that in the fervor of my    [sideways text] I have not demonstrated very clearly my premises, that my character  has been affected by my sister I have however given you the principle upon  which I account for the phenomena of my mind and your  reasoning faculties will supply the deficiency—Upon the principal  of the association of ideas Shand the effect thereby produced  I think you will be able to find a solution of the problem  untill ten or twelve days ago the weather has been as mild and   pleasant as May in New England since that time the weather  has been variable cold and wet &c I suppose you have   winter in all its variety long before this time    I hope you will continue to write to me I shall be interested in  any account you may give of your spiritual and temporal  concerns—of the county character habits and pursuits of the  in habitants—weather &c Etc    Please make my Love acceptable to Mrs Woodruff.

 Terre Haute July 22 1837    Brother Wilford.    I received witH pleasure your letter dated  Farmington 7th Inst and read it over and over with much  satisfaction. I am much interested in the account of your  visit among our common friends and I know not that anything  could afford me higher pleasure than to participate with you in  the joy of such an occasion. It has been our lot to be seperated  for a long time and under circumstances rather unusual.  Yet it does not appear to me that there can be any reason to  apprehend that the kindred ties that which unite us have in any  degree loosened their bond. We are still brothers— and friends  and while we have a sister—a mother and a common father  around whom to rally the purer sentiments of our hearts,  have we not a mutual pledge of Enduring affection—of  brotherly love? I am aware that the correspondence that has  passed between us since we parted has not been of a character  to evidence the highest degree of brotherly regard for  we have been perplexed with the cares and anxieties of life  and by the mysterious phenomena of mind have been  widely seperated in our views hence it is not strange that  our intercourse has been interrupted. But we do not  look to the regular and uniform interchange of written  communication for a pledge of each other's affection—we  have this assurance in the nature of our relations and  in our capacity to appreciate Each others claim.    You intimate the apprehension that your letters have not  interested me—you are mistaken—I have ever read your   letters with satisfaction and have only at times wished  that they contained a more particular account of your  personal affairs, being more interested in them than  in the great "common cause". 
 With regard to "Mormonism" I suppose we do not differ  much about its peculiar doctrines. In the application of  the principles of these doctrines, however I imagine I shall  not for some time be able to see the propriety of the course  pursued by Mormons. I do not indeed believe that the  prominent doctrines of the sect are peculiar to "Mormonism  proper". These doctrines have been maintained ever since  the gospel was preached by a large number of every sect  and I have yet to be satisfied that these popular doctrines  were not introduced into the Mormon Economy in an  arbitrary manner to decare the influence and favor  of that respectable portion of community.    So it respects the inspiration of the "Book of Mormon"  and of "Mr Smith" (the prophet) or indeed any of the   pretensions of the "Saints" of which I am informed I do  not think them unreasonable. I do not know but they  ^are^ in perfect accordance with the revelation of the  doctrine of Jesus Christ as presented to us in the  Bible but I have yet to be convinced that they are  more than empty pretensions. Every prominent  doctrine of Mormonism may true be true, while the  leaders of the sect, those indeed who assume to them-  selves the high prerogation of teachers from God  to man may be rotten in heart, corrupt in life  and ignorant of the first principle of holy religion  These are some of my views. I entertain a dear respect  for the cause and tho I have sometimes spoke lightly  of it as in some of my letters to my friends it has  not been with the intention to ridicule, but rather  to gratify my propensity to amuse myself at the  expense of others. 
 You see I employ the term "Mormon" when  refering to your church. I do this respectfully and  only because it is the most convenient term I can  find. And I can discover no impropriety in it for  other sects on designated by some popular term  and it would be nonsense for "Latter Day Saints"  to deny that they are a sect for ^they are^ as thoroughly identified  with sectarianism as other churches.    I hope you will write to me again soon and may I  not expect the pleasure of seeing you here in the course  of the fall. I think you would do well to visit this  part of the "Vineyard" and which perhaps you ^will^ think all-  most equal to Zion. This is a beautifull country  but sin stalks abroad in the land and blights her  fa[page torn] charms.    [page torn] present my highest regard to your "companion  in love" and believe me    Most Truly Yours  Asahel H Woodruff    Wilford Woodruff    P.S Accept my thanks for the "Bank    Note" you sent me. It is a pretty  specimen of Engraving & design  pray tell me ^whichether^ the Vignette (a  "Sheep Shearing")  refers to any   part of the discipline of Saints"    Asahel

 Terre Haute July 22nd 1838.    Sunday A. M.    Ever dear brother.    I have now before me three unanswered letters from you having  dates, "Vinal Haven March 10th" "Scarborough May 2thnd" and Farmington   June 26th 1838. From one so prone to complain of the neglect of correspondents as  I am, such delinquency as this comes with a bad grace, and I would offer an  apology for an excuse, but then I hate excuses, and so will substitute an expl-  anation. I have not been inattentive to your letters nor have I lacked a feeling of  deep interest in them, but I have so weighed them. And have so felt the importance  of the subject which has generally and mainly employed your pen that I have des-  ired to return appropriate answers. And hence have delayed from day to day and  from week to week for time to do justice to your favors untill so much matter   has accumulated upon which I should be pleased to communicate my reflections  that I fear my pen recoils as I now attempt to direct it. I have been so  kindly disposed towards you as to pass the "firm resolve" to answer your every letter, and  to give you line for line and thought for thought nay morey—I have laid other  plans for your entertainment and perhaps amusement. I have designed giving you such  details of "the way the world has gone with me" since I parted with you at [Richland],  that you would be enabled to see before you as "large as life" your little brother,  and comprehend the object of his existence but I have deferred the matter untill   I should have "a more convenient season" and so time which waiteth for no  man has imperceptibly glided away while I have not discharged ^even^ the immediate  duties of brother to brother much less have I accomplished thou high designs   which I had conceived for your gratification as the unaffected offerings  of friend to friend. And this is but the history of my whole concern    fromFrom my earliest life I have been continually laying plans for future  ("greatness", shall I say?) nay whatever may have been my frailties and foibles   I have not had ^added^ the folly of aspiring to greatness., my plans have been  of future goodness and usefulness. In early life I became enamoured of the  charms of virtue, and the aspirations of my heart were after goodness and truth   my ambition led me to aspirey—high indeed—but after humility and meekness  and it was in the lowliness of my mind that at a very tender age I well remem-  ber feeling the kindlings of a virtuous pride in anticipations of future goodness  and usefulness. But ah! how sadly have my well formed but ill timed plans  been frustrated The accursed spirit of procrastination has been the canker  worm of my degradation, What has been to me the duty of to day has been  made the business of to morrow. And to morrow has not come!!    I am aware that it is common place confession to speak of one's misimproved time,   And to acknowledge the sin and folly of procrastination is but a modest way  of intimating that we are not righteous over much but brother it is the history   of scenes of no common folly and neglect that I here divulge and if you could  perceive as I feel the sickly barrenness of my mind and the polluted sinfulness   of my heart and could be persuaded as I am that it is all the result of  putting off untill to morrow the business of to day you would indeed [groan]  at my calamity. It is a fact that in relation to the acquisition of knowledge  from books and from observation, to the cultivation of my mind by the   proper exercise of my intellect, to the encouragement of virtuous disposition   in my heart and the inclination to become good and win, as well  as in relation to the management of pecuniary matters and all things  appertaining to my life and the various relations I have procrastinated  every thing but my folly. 
 In your letter of March 10th you very kindly utter the wish that you could "commune with  some "Heavenly Messenger" and give vent before him to your feelings concerning tho to  whom you are bound by the ties or consanguinity" That you are often present in the spirit with  thou with whom you are bound by the ties of nature I have no doubt and it is a source of much  satisfaction to me to believe that I enjoy a liberal share of your regard that I do not deserve  much of your consideration is a reflection ungrateful indeed to me but nevertheless quite true  unless my appreciation of your worth and a tender regard for you as a brother and friend  entitles me to a corresponding degree of your regard. I have felt a good deal of  interest in the accounts you give of your travels in the ministry more particularly per-  haps because it is a matter which concerns your welfare though I per am unwilling  to admit that I do not feel a good deal of interest also in the progress the work in  which you are so successfully engaged. I have followed you to the far west to the  field of contest and there my apprehensions were excited for you as well as account of  your exposure to the evil designs of the world as to the contagious malady which  prevailed to so alarming and degree. My excitement was of a feverish character.  I feared that the hand of the violent man would fall upon you—that the abuses of  the vulgar and the coarse minded would be heaped upon your head as upon the head  of an outlaw and a ruffian, and that no voice would be heard in your defense  declaring that you were innocent of any evil designs upon the peace of comm-  unity. Then the work came as on the wings of the wind that a deadly contagion  had visited your camp and that scores had already fallen before you and  could I rest and be at peace while my brother stood exposed to the shafts  of death! But another word came which told of the breaking up of  your bandy—of its disperson to East and to the South to the North and to  the West and you were placed before me a wanderer over the fair  of the Earth in the capacity of a preacher of doctrines which were a by-  word and a proverb among men. I already fancied I saw you exposed  to the ridicule and the scoffs of bigots, hypocrites unbelievers wicked men and  devils and was pained at indignities and insults which I imagined were  being heaped upon you and I had not even the consolation of knowing that you were  engaged in the cause of God (for then indeed I could have endured to   see you suffer persecution, under the full persuasion that you would be  blessed and honored by the King of Saints) though I did not doubt that  you believed you were doing right and that you bore along with ^you^ a clear  conscience and an honest heart. Many long months passed away and I heard  not a word respecting you – what might have befallen you I was in doubts andbut  I felt a fearful apprehension that you something ill had befallen you. An  angry insurrection had been plotted and was discovered just upon the eve  of its breaking out—the people of the South were inflamed and their  vengeance was visited upon many innocent and unsuspecting persons, there   was no liberty of speech there and a person had only to be suspected of  entertaining sentiments appored to some of the institutions of the South  to be visited with all the horrors of a hellish anarchy. Under these circum-  stances my emmotions were such as I cannot well ^express^—my fears were of the  gloomist character for I knew your enthusiasm and your determination  to maintain your priviledges rights as an American citisen—perhaps in your  sentiments you were appored to the institution of slavery and in the fear  of God you would be constrained to raise your voice against it, a course  which would have brought upon you swift destruction from the presence of   men—and my forebodings were bitter indeed. If I had any hope for  your safety it was in the kind care of providence—I had no confidence  in the protection which would be afforded you in the plea that you 
 were a free citizen of this republic during that dark "reign of terror". But  I was permitted once more to hail your return to your friends, and to rejoice in the triumph  you had thus gained over the enemy and had the happiness once more to peruse the  lines dictated by your brotherly kindness. I saw you engage in preparing yourself  for the more efficient discharge of your duties as a minister of grace and among  your fellows I imagined you giving and receiving counsel in relation to matters app-  ertaining to the interests of "the Church" I saw you taking upon yourself the flowery  yoke of matrimony and, (believe me) I rejoiced in the consideration that in subm-  itting your neck to the yoke you had found a true yoke-fellow in whom you  might not only find an assistant bearer of your burdens and sharer of your sorrows and  joys but also an agreeable companion who should sweeten the sorrows of your life,  and heighten the enjoyments of your happier hours by her cheerful smile and devoted  love. I saw you bending your way to the far East to enter a new field, even to speak  the word to the "Islands of the Sea". I followed you in your journeyings and saw you  commence your labors upon the Islands—rejoice in your sucess—prayed for  your comfort and safety—lamented the bigotry and intolerance you encountered,  and left ashamed with you that men, nay—that those who present themselves  to the world as ambassadors from the Court of Heaven,   should so far depart  from the principles of spirit of enlightened, liberal, & republican principles  (to say nothing of the principles of the religion they profess) as did thou  preachers and Elders who so ungenerously opposed you. Fools that they are!  to believe in a God and to worship him in the forms of his religion and at the  same time to have so little confidence in His cause as to fear and quake lest  a handful of "Mormons" should upturn there it root and branch! I followed  you on your return to the main land and accompanied you again to the land of your  birth, was with you in spirit aroundat a fathers house and did not envy  you the paternal affection and maternal tenderness which you there enjoyed  and in the fulness of a brothers heart I did not forget to yield to you  the entire devotion of a sisters heart. It was indeed a priviledge which you  enjoyed to spend so pleasant a season at home and I should have been happy  [therin] happy to have made one in the family circle on that occasion. But how   soon I shall enjoy that pleasure with you or whether such happiness is in  reserve for me at all is a subject I do not like to reflect upon. But I have  not forgotten that previous to your last visit at home you went to New York  that you then met with your bre[thren] from Europe and heard from them of  the progress of the "work" in a foreign land. I went up the North River  with you and across the hills and dales to Connecticut. Conjured up all the   familiar faces in Avon, Lovely street cider brooks &c &c and brought  them up to hear the mormon preacher, and [have] several times gone down  with you to the solumn waters of baptism. All them and many other  picturesscenes have I frequently imagined myself a witness of—and this hasty  and imperfect outline so imperfectly drawn (in my haste) has afforded  the subject of many a picture which I have dwelt upon with much  interest drawing so largely upon my imagination it would be expected  that many of the scenes which I should represent to myself would be mere  fancy sketches and I presume that in following your amid the diver-  sified scenes of the last few years of your life I have often followed you at  a great distance and sometimes perhaps have mistook^aken^ your way. That I  have not fully ^properly^ appreciated the spirit by which your steps have been directed  I think is more than probable for indeed I am incompetent to judge with regard  to the character of the cause in which you have been engaged I have ^having^ never  been able to avail myself of such information as would enable me to form  adequate ideas of the origin—character and tendency of Mormonism. 
 Brother, I have repeated to you that I feel interested in the question of Mormonism  I again repeat that I am deeply so. There then no other reason than that I have a  brother who is identified with the leaders of the Society this would be sufficient ground  for any interest which I may feel. But when to there is added the consideration that my  father—my mother and my only sister as well as many other friends are under  its influence and are liable to become members of the society it becomes doubly  my interest and duty to enquire if the doctrine be true. If Mormonism  is the work of God and the peculiarities of Mormonism are founded in  Eternal Truth I desire to know it. If it is true then my highest interest  and the highest interest and the highest interest of my friends is involved  in our embracing it with all its terms. If it is untrue or if in other terms  Mormonism—proper and peculiar is not founded inupon direct revelation  from Heaven God forbid that one of us should be under its influence  another day. That the prominent doctrines of Mormonism are in general  correct and are even more reasonable than perhaps ^those of^ any other sects I am  ready enough to believe but then their doctrines may all be true founded  upon correct principles and yet Joseph Smith Jr may be as arrant  [as known] and as great an impostor as ever lived. if this is the case  we can renounce Mormonism and at the same time retain every   correct principle and doctrine which it embodies. But I must [close]  I will only now add that I am bound to believe Joseph Smith Jr and all  the leaders of your society honest men untill it is disproved. Yet I  have no proof of the truth of their pretensions except the admission  you have made and they are not satisfactory to me not being as  explicit as I could wish. I shall probably trouble you with some questions regarding  this subject before long and shall hold you responsible for the result of the same  by virtue of the interest which we mutually have in an only sister who is inclined  to become a member of the Church of the Latter Days Saints. Hold yourself  ready and peradventure you may make a believer of me and to God shall be  all the glory.

 Terre Haute Nov 24th 1837    Dear brother    Your letter dated Vinal haven. Oct 20th is before  me and has been perused over and over with much satisfaction  I thank you sincerely for this token of your regard, and am the more  gratified with the favor from the indications which it manifests  that you desire my correspondence. In responding to your wishes  in this respect permit me to assure you I anticipate great pleasure.    I believe that a well regulated correspondence may be both interesting  and profitable and, situated as we are I can perceive no reason  why we should decline its advantages. And indeed when we consider  the relation we sustain to each other what reason can we find to justify  such neglect? An unreserved correspondence with you has for a  long time been an object of desire with me. I embrace then  thwith pleasure the priviledge (which I think the Spirit of your  letter warrants me in inferring you will grant) and hope I shall  hereafter be permitted to consider you a regular correspondent.  I hope you will write me often, and without regard to order in  refference to my answers for we are both so situated that we  cannot at all times observe regularity in our communication  We must write, then, whenever we are in the "mood" trusting  to circumstances for matter.    There is much in your letter I should like to nanswer, but must content  myself with noticing a part only. Could a brothers heart find any  thing more prominent in your letter than that which relates to his  only sister? You strike a tender chord when you allude to this  object of my first regard and when you speak of the change, time  has wrought in her—you bewilder my brain—you excite within  me a struggle between my imagination and my judgment, which  shows me too plainly my weakness—Confound it!! will you  believe that just as I ^was^ expressing the last sentence a pretty faced  girl of 14 years, of "undoubled character" who is in the habit of  visiting every body came plump in upon ^me^ and took her seat close  by me poking her head right into my face, exciting pretty  sensations? to mix with those ^sentiments^ I was just indulging in. It would  be a sin to resume the sacred subject. So while the fair one (?)  is looking at the picture books I will only nadd that sister  is at home in Farmington, attending the Academy, that   I long to see her and if I don't forget where I left off I will  resume to the sentimental again, and render the passage  complete and the idea intelligible. 
 Next in turn as connected with the subject I was so unfortunately  interrupted in pursuing, would come the change in me, but here  I am at total loss, the matter being so completely involved in the  former subject that I could not discuss it except in connection  so you will please have the goodness to wait unttill untill I take  up the former again when I promise to present the  latter free from obscurity. But lest you should by some  strange vaguary get the notion that I am ^in^ the way to be  a great man I will here promise that you will be sadly  disappointed when you are informed with regard to my  character. I honestly fear I shall never meet the expectations  of those of my friends whose anticipations were the most  moderate, much less those whose partiality led them to  suppose me a clever fellow.    You enquire whether I have "any intelligence from brother Azmon  and family or Thompson" I presume I know nothing of them  that you did not learn at home, for the last I heard from them  was in a letter from home before you visited. Neither of them  have written to me except Azmon wrote one letter perhaps  eighteen months ago God bless them! if He don't I really don't  know who will have an opportunity to do so soon.    You also enquire about my business and when I think of going   East, to the latter I reply I have been thinking of going East  next "two months" for the last two and half years, when  I shall so digest my thoughts as to be able to reduce them  to practice I do not know, probably, however next Spring  Business has been generally (as you will anticipate) dull  the last season throughout this part of the country, for   reasons which all intelligent persons are acquainted with  it is however improving and the prospect for next  year is fair. Produce will be 75 ^5025 or 30^ pr ct lower  this winter than last, which will in fact be nearer the  real value than former prices.    Our business—I mean the business of Woodruff & Smith  has been as good as we anticipated, and is increasing  The amount of our sales of Books & Stationery for the  first year ending in September last was (over) 
 between Eleven and twelve thousand dollars, this  and when it is considered that we have done this without  capital and under the disadvantages incidental to  the establishment of a new house and have been able  to meet all our engagagements unassisted we challenge  any establishment in the West to produce a better result  of first years opperations. If we have not profited  directly, I have not doubt we have established a  character for business which is worth the trouble we  have been at to acquire.    I am much interested in the amount of your success in the ministry  and I hope continual success—commensurate with your talents  and application will be the reward of your labors. I thank you  for the information you give respecting that section of country  Such intillegence will be always grateful to a mind which  desires knowledge. Mr Smith my partner was in Illinois  not long since—he saw one of the Derrings from Avon.  Mr Derring mentioned you to him, told him that he  heard you preach in South Canton and what was  more silly than all added h that you were [page torn] [the worst]  Preacher" he ever heard. I dont believe a wo[rd] [o]f it    I am anxious to know something more particular about  Sister Eunice, will you be good enough to tell me  undisguisedly what you think of her. I shall expect  a minute description of her personal appearance  and of the capacity of her mind. Excuse this weakness.  [2 illegible words] pleasure with Mrs the [illegible]    I shall be grateful if you will so present my respects  to Mrs Woodruff as to ensure their acceptance and  you may present me to all who are interested to enquire  after me    Your brother  Asahel H Woodruff    Willford Woodruff

 Terre Haute Sept 9th 1838    Dear brother    I received yours of 25 ulto yesterday  P. M. I am very sorry you did not mention some  place where I might direct a letter which might reach  you before you should arrive here, but presuming  you did not intend to avoid my correspondence I now  address you and hope you get the letter at Farmington  I have calculate to go home this fall and shall probably  do so though I should regret thus to loose the chance  of seeing you on your way to "Far West" I shall  think it unkind if you do not advise me from some  point on your route when you will be in Terre Haute  that I may not be absent. I insist upon your writing from   Columbus, O. When at Columbus, O. I wish you to find  James Kilbourn Jr a cousin and esteemed friend of mine  He is a young Physician of the "Reformed Medical School"  was recently married as he has informed me by letter and  is a very clever fellow. He will be glad to see you and  will tell you about Uncle Asahel Hart's family.    At Indianapolis you may if you please present yourself  and lady to John W Osborne, Editor of the Indiana  Farmer and Stock Register, and of the Indiana Tem-  perance advocate. Mr Osborne is my friend  and will be glad   to be civil to my brother.

 New York March 28th 1850    Mr. Woodruff    Dear sir,    Yours of the 26th inst  came to hand. I supposed I could borrow  in Portland the amt Mr. C mention-  ed, and wrote according to Cs request   to have it forwarded to you without  delay. I recd information from there  yesterday that they had already ad-  vanced Mr C all they could possably  spare and that they could not advance  or loan a cent more. There is no pos-  sable way of my procuring any funds  here at presant. I wish you would write  E and state to him the circumstances  just what amount it will require to   start with and that a part must  be sacrificed unless that amount  can be obtained, also inform him  when you will leave Boston.    Mr S is here I had a long interview  with him this morning, he was to write  his partner to day. I think if you 
 write him particulars, they will raise the   amount required for you, or a bout the  give them as much time as possabe to do  it in. (I wrote E again to day)  I should be very sorry to have you  disapointed as the result would be bad  you can be assured if ^it^ was in my   power to do any thing here I should  most cheerfully do it at once. I  will understand it. We shall expect  you to call upon us when you pass  through Our City, if you should not   remain over night you will find  me with B Sanger over Bulkley &  Claflins store no 68 Cedar St. or if   you do not intend making any stay  here and will write me when you   will be here, and when I can see you  I will call upon you. Our place of  residence is No 19-17th Street one door  from Broad way.    Resp Yours  J S Shaw    To Mr W Woodruff

GIBSON MILLER & RICHARDSON OMAHA.    P. O. BOX B.    Salt Lake City, U. T.  April 5th 1888.    Elder Joseph F. Smith,   Washington, D. C.    Dear Brother Joseph F.:    A longer time has elapsed   since our last communication to you than we intended;   but we have been so engrossed with business and con-  stant meetings of the Council that this is the first   leisure we have had to send you a letter in acknow-  ledgement of several that we have received from you.   The following dispatch was sent to you yesterday:    "Sayer write fully concerming your ar-  rangements for emigration to Teasdale immediately. Through   rate from Liverpool to Salt Lake fixed at fifty five dollars.   Instruct Teasdale to collect through fares as usual and 
 pay them to Huntington agent at Liverpool and cable  me amount to make up railroad fares and I will for-  ward to Newport News. Request him to ascertain fare   from Copenhagen and cable me."    We hope it reached you safely and that you   have been able to communicate fully with Brother Teas-  dale (who seems greatly exercised concerning the emigration)   so that he might be able to make his arrangements for   transportation from the Continent. Several of his letters   of late have been very strongly pleading against any   change. I have written him to-day upon these points   and explained to him the position and informed him   that though Guions were our friends and we felt kindly   disposed to them, yet this was not a matter of senti-  ment, but of money. Our poor people were not able to   pay large amounts and it was quite a consideration with   us to have a low fare. Besides, Mr. Huntington had   been an undeviating friend of ours for many years in   political matters and had rendered us aid on many   occasions, and always responded when called upon; so 
 that we were not leaving Guions to go to someone who   had no regard for us. He seems to be troubled about   transportation from the Continent and seems to think that   no one can have the same advantages that the Guions  Co. has had in this respect. But before we engaged   with the Guions Co. our people were brought from the   Continent without any difficulty, and we presume by   a little management they can again be transported to  Liverpool in the same way.    Malu (The news that you have written us con-  cerning your interviews with Maude and Dellie has   been very satisfactory. Their letters also have been   quite encouraging, and Maude is particularly kind in   his expressions concerning yourself and the associations   they have had with you. We trust that their labors   there have been of benefit and that the effect in our   favor will be apparent to our brethren, without their   knowing how these results are brought about. Maude  writes that he is overworked and almost broken down, 
 so we suppose he has had plenty to do for other parties   as well as for us.)    We regret that Brother John W. Young should   feel oppressed either with monetary embarrassments or   with any depression of mind. It certainly would have   given everyone of his friends great pleasure to have seen   him continue his labors in connection with yourself and   the brethren, and not to have allowed any improper feel-  ing to arise within him concerning our action as a   committee, or yourself and the brethren as individuals.   We certainly have had no feelings but those of the  utmost kindness and friendliness towards him, and   it has been a cause of regret that we should be com-  pelled to say or do anything that would wound his   feelings in the least degree.    The statements which you make concern-  ing your expenditures are quite satisfactory. How much   more pleasant it would have been for all of us had   Bro. John W. taken the same course that you have! 
 Malū  (We can understand how the impression which Maude  says is prevalent respecting their being "millions" to buy   up Congress should get out. The style in which Bro.   John W. has moved and the lavish manner in which   he has used means would naturally create such an   impression and would operate against an economical   campaign.)    You ask what accounts you should con-  sider as coming under the control of the Committee.   The understanding you have got that Mr. Gibson and   Mr. Curtis and the Republican are all arrangements   outside of the State movement is correct. These gentle-  men were employed and the arrangement was made   with the Republican some time before the State move-  ment was thought about, and whatever means have  been paid out of the "Fund" to these parties should   be separated from the "Fund" account and charged to   the account to which they were formerly charged.   Your own expenses, and the expenses of the brethren 
 engaged in the State movement, and whatever you   pay out to newspapers or in other quarters which have   a direct bearing and are connected with the State move-  ment, should be charged to the "Fund." Whatever may   be necesssary to expend in conducting the ordinary busi-  ness such as has been heretofore done at sessions of   Congress, should be placed in the accounts they were   formerly charged to.    The suggestions concerning the Elders of   the Southern States were submitted to the Council and   they seemed to feel reluctant about withdrawing them   from the field entirely; but it was suggested that a  letter be written to the President of the Southern States   Mission, asking him to make his arrangements so that   they would avoid laboring in places where hostility   was excited or where unfavorable comments would be   made by the press. I had, however, some little time   ago, suggested to Elder Wm Spry, (who presides now   over the Southern States Mission) this same line of 
 policy and called his attention to the position that   we were occupying at the present time in endeavoring  to get a State government, and how necessary it was   that we should not create any more excitement in the   South than possible, as some of our friends in Congress   complained that their constituents wrote to them upon  the subject. This letter, when read to the Council, ap-  peared to be quite satisfactory to them. I have since   received a letter from Bro. Spry, in reply to mine  upon this subject, in which he acquiesces and in-  timates that he will carry out the policy suggested.    ^Attorneys—Malū x^ It is with great regret that we hear   about the differences of views among our attorneys in   regard to the proper method of conducting the Church   suit. These differences weaken us very much and make   us feel that our property is in great jeopardy. (Maude  wrote and telegraphed to us concerning an appeal.   He has appeared very anxious to have some plan   sent to him which he could bring through influential 
 friends before the Attorney General, so that the way might   be paved for carrying the case to the Supreme Court   and stopping the ixamination here. The telegrams which   we sent you contained this plan. We had Le Grand   Young, Sheeks & Rawlins and Judge Sutherland meet   with us and the dispatch that was sent you was   framed by them. They did not seem very clear in   their views about it; but Maude was so urgent to hear   from us that it seemed too bad that we could not   decide upon some way of getting this matter put in   shape that would bring it before the U.S. Supreme   Court for decision upon the constitutionality of the law.   He wrote to us and gave us the names of influential   parties that could be got to bring this matter before   Garland. We urged this upon our attorneys here several   times, but with no particular result until the night   when we sent you the dispatch, when we insisted on   something being given to us.) Of course, you will see   before this reaches you that Bro. M. M. Sheets has been 
 sent to the penitentiary. They hope, by means of this   case, through the merit of habeas corpus being brought  before the U. S. Supreme Court, that the vital points  which we wish to have decided can be reached. You   inform us, however, in your recent letter that our attor-  neys there have doubts even upon this point. This  seems to surprise Bro. LeGrand Young; for he asserts   that Col. Broadhead has written to him, asking why  the habeas corpus case has not been obtained. We are  doing the very best we can here, under the circumstances;   but the probabilities are, from present appearances, that   unless there should be something done to stop the   operations, this investigation will take a very wide  range and every transaction of the Church will be   pryed into and, if possible, unsettled.    We telegraphed you in regard to Pad-  dock. You said that you did not know how to   reach him. The U.P. people, doubtless, can check   him, if anyone can, as they, no doubt, contributed to his 
 election and without their aid he would ^not^ have been   where he is. Mr. Sidney Dillon has always mani-   fested a kind feeling, and perhaps Messrs. Shellaberger  & Wilson, who are in the employ of the U.P. people,   might be able to furnish you some aid in getting   this matter before Mr. Dillon or the U.P. people.  We deserve some aid at their hands, and if they   are appealed to properly they ought to render it.    We hope you will be able to get along with   the Woman's International Council without having   any tirade against us. Your proposal to aid them   is a good one and we hope you will be able to   carry it out and to check any such ebullition as is   threatened.    We entirely approve of the price that   you have offered Bro. John W. Young—$25000 per   month—for your board and lodgings for the four   months ending April 1st. We would like to see   him satisfied and hope that anything you can do 
 to comply with his wishes, if they are not intirely too   unreasonable, will be done by you.    We join in love to you, and the brethren   of the Council send their love. We constantly remem-  ber you and uphold you in our faith and prayers,   and trust you will be kept from the hands of all   your enemies and be very successful in performing   every duty that devolves upon you.    We are  Your Brethren,   Wilford Woodruff  Geo. Q. Cannon    [sideways text] Committee. [end of sideways text]

 G. S. L. City Feby. 4 1857    Editor of the Mormon    Dear Sir,  We have not received any Eastern mail for the last 3 months   Mr. Gerrish arrived from the Plains on the 19 th. Ulto, reports a mail   somewhere on the way. We have received the California Mail regularly up to   this time, by which we occasionally hear something from the lower world.    The Jan. mail for the East was sent out, but only got to the top  of the little mountain, before it was stopped by the vast quantity of snow,  and one carrier froze to death, the remainder returned. We are passing through  the most severe winter so far as snow is concerned that we have ever ex-  perienced in these vallies, the mountains are full, and over 8 feet has  fallen in this city acording to Judge Phelps' report, it has lain for a   month between 2 & 3 feet deep in our streets, and about 3 feet on the islands  & more North. All the stock have been brought from the Island, and  some from the North, and were fed in the city, some driven South, and  some to Rush valley, notwithstanding the great amount of snow there has  been but few of the stock lost in comparison to the loss last winter. The  abundance of Snow in the mountains will be of great benefit for irri-  gation the coming season, the Earth needs it as it has been very dry fo[r]  two years. The wheat which was sown in the dry dust last Fall  has sprouted under the snow, and grown several inches, we have had a  constant thaw for about one week past, which causes the water to gradually  soak into the soil. The inhabitants of this city have again commenced labor  upon the cotton wood canal, to bring that stream to this city, and they  expect to finish it by the opening of Spring. the inhabitants of Davis  County have also commenced on a Canal to take out a portion of the  Weber river into Davis County for irrigation, mills &c. 
 We would like to have some of our Eastern friends forward us a few  of the tubers of the chinese Potatoe as advertized by Wm. R. Prince Hoy.  as we would like to make a trial of it in this Territory, we would  also wish our friends who are emigrating to this Territory to still bear  in mind, the propriety of  bringing with them or forwarding as they  may have opportunity anychoice fruit seeds, cuttings, roots &c. that will be  a benefit to the Territory. We would like to obtain some of Hoveys seedling  strawberries or any other good kinds & Lawton's blackberry, Catawba & Isabella Grapes,  Indigo or madder or cotten seeds, and seed from the chinese sugar cane or  Millet. Hon. J. M. Bernhisel has blessed us from time to time with seeds  and grain from the Patent office, some of which I think will prove quite a  benefit to us for which we feel to return him our thanks.    The Reformation is progessing throughout this city and Territory with  great interest. President Young has given much valuable information and  teaching to the Quorums and people, although he has not been able to attend  the meeting at the Tabernacle since the burial of President J. M. Grant on  the 4th. Decem. Ulto. until last Sunday the 1st inst. He with his  counsellors H. C. Kimball & D. H Wells all appeared in the stand, the Tabernacle  was crowded to overflowing as has been the case nearly all Winter and  hundreds have to l[e]ave who cannot get into the house. the appearance  of Prest. Young in the Tabernacle after an absence of two months created  a sensation throughout the vast assembly, he addressed the people for about  one hour and a half, his discourse was very interesting and edifying to the  people, he was clothed with the spirit and power of God and the hearts  of the people were open to receive his words which were quick & powerful.  He was followed by Presidents Kimball and Wells, all of the discourses will  appear in the News. President Kimball has spoken to the people for  several Sabbaths previous upon several subjects in great plainness presenting 
 the parable of the vineyard, the vine &c., to illustrate his ideas, his  teachings have been of much benefit to the Saints. The Twelve who  were here, have gone forward with the missionaries through every ward  in the city, teaching the Elders and the people, meeting with the various  Quorums of the church, we have attended a meeting of some kind al-  most every evening for three months. The people are rising up en masse  and trying to live their religion, by confessing and forsaking their sins,   and preparing for the waters of Baptism, the spirit and power of  God is manifest in Zion. The word of the Lord through his  servants who are clothed with the power of God and the fire of the  Holy Ghost causes the sinner to tremble and fearfulness to surprize the  hypocrite, and the people universally feel like putting away sin and  iniquity of every kind. all places of worship both in the city and country  are crowded to excess. The people are beginning more to feel the importance  of living their religion magnifying their calling and building up the  kingdom of God. Their has been four of the quorum of the Twelve in  this city during the sitting of the Legislature viz. O Hyde, L. Snow,  F. D. Richards & myself. Elder Hyde has now gone South on a  mission through the city and brother Snow is mostly confined to Box  Elder. Elder Richards & myself remain in this city at present.  we expect Elders A. Lyman & C. C. Rich will be with us this  Spring.    yours truly,  W. Woodruff 
 Bro. Taylor. I have named in my letter that I wished to  get the chinese Potatoe. I have written to J. M. Bernhisel to  see something about it but not knowing that he will be able  to do it, I wish you would send to Wm. R. Prince $5.00  and direct him to put up that amount, and send it to  W. Woodruff, Great Salt Lake city U T & I will pay  the money here in any way that you will order.    W. W 
 TO THE SAINTS:    To the officers and members of the  Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-   day Saints, in General Conference  assembled:    Dear Brethren  and Sisters– Every  Latter-day Saint will recognize the  value of union, not only in action but  in the matters of faith and discipline. As   to the rights and authority of the  Priesthood of the Son of God, it is of  the highest importance of opinion  among the officers and members of the  Church of  Jesus Chr[i]st of Latter-day   Saints. Feeling the necessity if a cor-  rect understanding of this prin-  ciple, we deem it proper at   this sixty-sixth anniversary of the   organization of the Church in these  last days, to prepare and present state-  ment on the subject, embodying the   doctrine which has always prevailed  in the Church, and our views upon it.  We are prompted to adopt this course  at the present time because of events  which have happened during the late  political contest. A great diversity of   opinion on the subject has been ex-  pressed, and even by leading Elders in  the Church, which latter fact has  naturally led in some instances to   considerable division of sentiment.    It is of great importance that we un-  derstand each other and that there be   harmony in our teachings. It is espec-  ially important that these teachings  shall be in accordance with the rules  and regulations and doctrines which  have been taught and which have pre-  vailed from the beginning until the  present time, having not only the  sanction of undisputed usage, but the   approval of all faithful leaders in the  Church and of Him in whose name  and by whose authority they act.    In the late exciting contest, to which  reference has been made, the presiding  authorities in some instances have been  misunderstood. In other instances   they have been misrepresented,  which has led to a wrongful  conception of their real views.  It has been asserted too freely,  and without foundation, that there has  been a disposition on their part to in-  terfere with individual liberty and to   rebuke in some men a course which   was applauded in others. In a word,  that they have appeared to desire to  assert and maintain an unjust and op-  pressive control over the actions of the   members of the Church, and in thus  doing have endeavored to effect a  Union of Church and State. In the  heat of political discussion,  asser-  tions have been made and ar-  guments used conveying to the pub-  [l]ic mind a false idea concerning 
 the position of the officers of the  Church, and leaving the impres-  sion that there has been and was  now being made an attempt to ac-  complish the union above referred to.  Now that the excitement has passed,  and calmer reason has resumed its  sway, we think it prudent to set forth,  so that all may understand, the exact  position occupied by the leading au-  thorities of the Church.    In the first place we wish to state in  the most positive and emphatic lan-  guage that at no time has there ever  been any attempt or even desire on the  part of the leading authorities referred  to to have the Church in any manner  encroach upon the rights of the State,   or to unite in any degree the functions  of the one with those of the other.  Peculiar circumstances have sur-  rounded the people of Utah. For many  years a majority of them in every por-  tion of the Territory belonged to one  Church, every reputable member  of which was entitled to hold and  [old] some ecclesiastical office. It  is easy to see how, to the casual ob-  server, it might appear singular that  so many officers of the Church were  also officers of the State; but while  this was in fact the case, the distinc-  tion between the Church and the State  throughout those years was carefully  maintained. The President of the   Church held for eight years the high-  est civil office in the community,  having been appointed by the national  administration governor of the Ter-  ritory. The first secretary of the Terr-  tory was a prominent Church official.  An Apostle represented the Territory  in Congress as a delegate during ten  years. The members of the Legisla-  ture held also offices in the Church.  This was unavoidable; for the most  suitable men were elected by the votes   of the people, and, as we have stated,  every reputable man in the entire com-  munity held some Church position,  the most energetic and capable hold-  ing leading positions. This is all  natural and plain enough to   those who consider the cir-  cumstances; but it furnished oppor-  tunity for those who were disposed to   assail the people of the Territory to  charge them with attempting to unite  Church and State. A fair investigation  of the conditions will abundantly dis-  prove the charge and show its utter  falsity.    On behalf of the Church of which we  are leading officers, we desire again to  state to the members and also to the  public generally, that there has not  been, not is there, the remotest desire  on our part or on the part of our co-  religionists to do anything looking to a  union of Church and State.    We declare that there has never been  any attempt to curtail individual  liberty – the personal liberty of any of  the officers or members of the Church.  The First Presidency and other lead-  ing officers did make certain sugges-  tions to the people when the division   on party lines took place. That move-  ment was an entirely new departure,  and it was necessary, in order that the  full benefit should not be lost  which was hoped to result from  this new political division,  that people who were inexperi-  enced should be warned against hasty  and ill-considered action. In some  cases they were counseled to be wise  and prudent in the political steps  they were about to take, and this with  no idea of winning them against their  will to either side. To this extent, and   no further, was anything said or done  upon this question, and at no time and  under no circumstances was any attempt  made to say to voters how they should  cast their ballots. Any charge that  has been made to the contrary is ut-  terly false.    Concerning officers of the Church  themselves, the feeling was generally  expressed in the beginning of the po-  litical division spoken of that it would  be prudent for leading men not to ac-  cept of office at the hands of the po-  litical party to which they might be-  long. This counsel was given to men  of both parties alike – not because it  was thought that there was any impro-  priety in religious men holding civil  office, not to deprive them of any of  the rights of citizenship, but because  of the feeling that it would be better  under all the circumstances which had  now arisen to avoid any action that  would be likely to create jealousy and   ill-feeling. An era of peace and  good-will seemed to be dawning upon  the people, and it was deemed good to  shun everything that could have the   least tendency to prevent the con-  summation of this happy pros-  pect. In many instances, how-  ever, the pressure brought to  bear upon efficient and popular men  by the members of the parties to which  they belonged was of such a character  that they had to yield to the solicitation  to accept nomination to office, or sub-  ject themselves to the suspicion of bad  faith in their party affiliations. In  some cases they did this without con-  sulting the authorities of the Church;  but where important positions were  held, and where the duties were of a  responsible and exacting character,  some did seek the counsel and ad-  vice of the leading Church authorities  before accepting the political honors  tendered them. Because some others  did not seek this counsel and advice,  ill-feeling was engendered, and undue  and painful sensitiveness was stimu-  lated; misunderstanding readily fol-  lowed and as a result the authorities  of the Church were accused of bad  faith and made the subjects of bitter  reproach. We have maintained that  in the case of men who hold high  positions in the Church, whose duties  are well defined, and whose ec-  clesiastical labors are understood  to be continuous and necessary,  it would be an improper thing to ac-  cept political office or enter into any  vocation that would distract or remove  them from the religious duties resting  upon them, without first consulting  and obtainig the approval of their   associates and those who preside over  them. It has been understood from  the very beginning of the Church that  no officer whose duties are of the   character referred to, has the right to   engage in any pursuit, political or  otherwise, that will divide his time and   remove his attention from the calling  already accepted. It has been the  constant practice with officers of the  Church to consult—or, to use our lan-  guage, to "counsel"—with  their breth-  ren concerning all questions of this  kind. They have not felt that they  were sacrificing their manhood in do-  ing so, nor that they were submitting  to improper dictation, nor that in so-  liciting and acting upon the advice  of those over them, they  were in any manner doing  away with their individual rights and  agency, nor that to any improper de-  gree were their rights and duties as  American citizens being abridged or   interfered with. They realized that  in accepting ecclesiastical office they  assumed certain obligations; that  among these was the obligation to  magnify the office which they held, to  attend to the duties in preference to   every other labor, and to devote them-  selves exclusively to it with all the  zeal, industry and strength they  possessed, unless released in  part or for a time by those  who preside over them. Our view, and  it has been the view of all our prede-  cessors, is that no officer of our Church,   especially those in high standing,  should take a course to violate this long-  established practice. Rather than  disobey it, and declare himself by his  actions defiantly independent of his  associates and his file leaders, it has  always been held that it would be  better for a man to resign the duties of  his Priesthood: and we entertain the  same view today.    In view of all the occurrences to which  reference has been made, and to the  diversity of views that have arisen  among the people in consequence, we 
 feel it to be our duty to clearly define  our position, so there may be no cause  hereafter for dispute or controversy  upon the subject.    First—We unanimously agree to and  promulgate as a rule that should al-  ways be observed in the Church  and by every leading official  thereof, that before accepting any  position, political or otherwise,  which would interfere with the proper  and complete discharge of his ecclesi-  astical duties, and before accepting a  nomination or entering into engage-  ments to perform new duties, said  official should apply to the proper au-  thorities and learn from them whether  be can, consistently with the obliga-  tions already entered into with the  Church upon assuming his office, take  upon himself the added duties and  labors and responsibilities of the new  position. To maintain proper discipline  and order in the Church, we deem  this absolutely necessary; and in as-  serting this rule, we do not consider  that we are infringing in the least de-  gree upon the individual rights of the  citizen. Our position is that a man  having accepted the honors and oblige-  tions of ecclesiastical office in the  Church cannot properly of his own  volition make those honors subordi-  nate to or even co-ordinate which new  ones of  an entirely different character;  we hold that unless he is willing to  counsel with and obtain the con-  sent of his fellow-laborers and presid-  ing officers in the Priesthood, he  should be released from all obligations  associated with the latter, before ac-  cepting any new position.    Second—We declare that in making  these requirements of ourselves and  our brethren in the ministry, we do  not in the least desire to dictate to  them concerning, or to interfere with  the affairs of the State; neither do we  consider that in the remotest  degree we are seeking the  union of Church and State. We  once more here repudiate the insinua-  tion that there is or ever has been an  attempt by our leading men to trespass  upon the ground occupied by the State,  or that there has been or is the wish  curtail in any manner any of its func-  tions.

 August 24 1894    President Wilford Woodruff    Salt Lake City.    Dear Brother:    By permission of the Stake Presidency we have  intended to hold a Conference of the Young Mens Mutual Improvement  [illegible] of the Salt Lake Stake of Zion, at the Tabernacle or  Assembly Hall, -to convene Sunday Oct. 28th, 1894, when we expect to  hold three meetings.    By bringing the officers, members, and Saints in general  together in this way, we believe our M. I. A. work can be greatly  encouraged.    And we want to eventually invite men, with their counselors  aide, to meet with us on this occasion, and earnestly hope we can  be privileged to have your presence.    We are your brother  in the Gospel,    Joseph H. Felt,  Royal E. Young,   James W. Eardly,    Stake Suptc'y of Y. M. M. I. A.    St. J. W. Mussen, 
  Wilford Woodruff,  Gen'l. Supt. Y.M.M.I.A.    Dear Brother: We respectfully submit the following questions  which have been proposed to us, and which we hope to be able to answer  at our Stake Y.M.M.I.A. Conference on Sunday next:    1st. What shall we do for Manuals No. 1? As many new members are  joining the associations, a greater part of whom are young people and   have received no manuals. We find it impracticable to proceed without  manuals.    2nd. How can we obtain Manual No. 2? It is only published in   the contributor, and but few of our members are able to subscribe for  it.    3rd. In most of our Associations there are many members who  been through Manual No. 1, two or three times, and are now prepared to  take Manual No. 2, and others in the same associations who have not yet  been through Manual No. 1; How shall we conduct both classes?    Hoping you will give this matter your immediate attention.    Your Brethren,  Stake Supt'cy. Y.M.M.I.A. 
 ELDERS JOURNAL    Vinalhaven, Fox Islands, Me.  March 9th, 1838.    BISHOP EDWARD PARTRIDGE, and PRESI-  DENTS JOSEPH SMITH JR., SIDNEY RIGDON,  HYRUM SMITH, and THE SAINTS IN ZION,  GREETING:    Dear friends in the new and everlasting  covenant;    I, Willford Woodruff, sit   down to inform you, that I have just   heard, correctly, of the deplorable state   of things in Kirtland, and I have this   day held a council with Elders J. Ball   and J. Townsend, who are now with   me upon these Islands, and we resolved   to address a few lines to you concern-  ing our feelings, and set before you a   brief account of things with us, and the   course we intend to pursue. I have   labored principally alone upon these   Islands, since Elder Hale left last fall,   and the work of the Lord has prosper-  ed in my hands, or in other words, the   Lord has worked with me during the   winter. Elder Joseph Ball has been   with me for a number of weeks past   upon the Islands. There is rising of   40 members in the church on these Isl-  ands, and they are strong in the faith.   I returned last evening from a mission   in company with Elder James Town-  send. we have been visiting the most   notable cities and vilages in the eastern   country, and delivering unto them the   word of God.    We preached in their City Halls,   Chapels, School houses, dwellings &c.,   in such places as Camden, Belfast,   Northport, Frankfort, Hampden and   the City of Bangor. Doors were open   in all of these places, and many others   I might mention, and the people heard   with profound attention; and many are   believing. I never saw more doors   open for doing good, than at the pres-  ent time in the State of Maine: But   the Devil is stired up against me here   on the Island.    One Methodist priest has applied   several times for a warrant to take me,   but the Officers, as yet, will not grant   him any, for he cannot bring any ac-  cusation against me in truth or justice.    The most trouble I now have, is the   stopping the papers. I have forwarded   about 30 subscribers with the money,   and now the press is burnt down, and   our enemies roar in the midst of the   congregations, and they set up these   ensigns for signs.    I expect the report of these things   will come like a clap of thunder in the   ears of the Saints upon these Islands   and else where. They do not know it   yet, but are wondering why these pa-  pers do not come. We have appointed   a time to meet the church, and we   shall lay all these things before them   and trust in God for wisdom to direct   us. The Elders that are with me are   expecting to go to their homes, and I   shall be left to fight the battles alone.   Brethren, pray for me out of Zion,   for I have a load to bear; but in the   name of Elijah's God, I am determined   to stand at my post. I feel as though   the time of Jacob's trouble had began,   but I know God will deliver him out of   it, and fulfil his word.    We are advising the Saints of God   to go from this country to Zion, as soon   as they can. I suppose this is right:   many are preparing to go the following   season.    Now we say to the Presidency of the   church in Zion; we do not expect to   counsel you, nor any one there, let   God be your counselors. But we ask,   can it not be consistent with the will of   God and your feelings and circum-  stances, to soon publish the Elders'  Journal from Zion, that we may have   one weapon, to cut away some of the   deep gloom, that will be cast upon the   minds of thousands of the Saints, by   wicked men and devils, and false breth-  ren. The traveling Elders feel the   wait of these things, equally, if not   more than those who are in Zion; for   we are naked targets to the press and   tongue, as we pass through the midst   of the Gentiles. O my God! have   mercy and support us, I pray, through   the toils that are to come, that our gar-  ments may be washed white in the   blood of the Lamb! for it is through   tribulation that we inherit the blessing   and overcome.    Could the Elders' Journal be contin-  ued, it would be great relief to the feel-  ings of all the faithful; for while our   enemies are publishing against us,   even in Kirtland, we should also know   what God is doing for his Saints.    Brethren, we pray you to consider   this last clause, not for our sake alone,   but for the sake of all the faithful that   are scattered abroad. We do not make   these remarks because we have any   lack of confidence in you—No. God   forbid, we believe you have done, and   will do all that lies in your power for 
 ELDERS JOURNAL    the salvation of Israel; and for one, I   pray God to take away my life, sooner   than to suffer me to turn my back upon   the faithful part of the church of Latter   Day Saints, and Joseph whom God   hath chosen to lead his people. O my   soul mourns over the corruptions of the   hearts of men! O how man will stum-  ble in dark places, when he neglects   prayer and departs from his God! O   ye Saints of Zion, watch and pray, and   keep the Celestial law, which is safe!    That you may know the feelings of   the undersigners of this page, we say   to you before God, that we are in full   fellowship with Joseph Smith jr. and   the first Presidency of the church, and   with all who still adhere to, and receive   their teachings and instructions; and   we say, in the name of Jesus Christ,   that we will uphold such by our pray-  ers, faith, and influence, at the risk of   our fortunes, lives, and worldly honor.   "For life is but a name, when virtue   and truth is gone."    We further believe, that judgment   awaits the world speedily, Kirtland not   excepted, and we do believe that those   who have dissented from the body of the   church, will have cause to lament for   their folly. We ask in the name of   reason and revelation, who has power   to take from Joseph, the keys delivered   to him by the God of Abraham, Isaac,   and Jacob, and deprive him of the   work that God has said he should per-  form? We answer, none but God   alone. We believe the book of Mor-  mon and Doctrine and Covenants,   speaks too loud upon the subject, to   fall unfulfilled and to be made void, by   those who have neglected prayer, and   departed from the living God, and   sought to take honor unto themselves.    O ye Saints of God in Zion! we en-  treat you to uphold Joseph by prayer,   faith, brotherly love, and charity: for   we testify, in the Spirit of God, that he   will be brought off conqueror, and his   enemies put to shame.    Do you remember his toils and la-  bors for your salvation? Nothing but   a God has supported him to the present   day. His perils are great, and the   greatest are among false brethren;   and we do entreat the Saints in Zion   not to add to his wounds, by following   the example of many in Kirtland.—  Bear with us, ye Saints of God, while   we exhort you to keep the Celestial   law of God, while in the land of Zion.    Be humble, be watchful, be prayerful.   Beware of pride, lest you fall like oth-  ers. We do not make these remarks   for compliment sake, we feel what we   say. Kirtland is and will be scourged,   to fulfill revelation and prophecy; it is   all right, the hand of God is in it.    God's work will not stop. He will   work for, and with his Saints. God   will redeem Jacob. God will build up   Zion. The Lord will establish Jerusa-  lem. And O ye Judges in Zion! that   God may bestow wisdom and salvation   upon you, is the prayer of    WILFORD WOODRUFF,  JAMES TOWNSEND, &  JOSEPH BALL.

 [stamp] BRIGHAM YOUNG   COLLEGE,   LOGAN, UTAH.    CIRCULAR No. 7.    (Circular Addressed by the General Church Board of Education to  Presidents of Stakes, June 8th, 1888.)    Dear Brethren: A meeting of the General Board of Educa-  tion was held today, and the subject of the educational interests of  the Latter-day Saints was taken into consideration and discussed at  some length.    It was decided that a Board of Education, consisting of not  less than five and not to exceed eight in number, should be selected  in each Stake to take charge of and promote the interests of edu-  cation in the Stake.    This communication is addressed to you to inform you of this   action, and to have you select energetic men who are friends of  education, who understand the needs of the people, and who have  influence with the Saints, to carry out any suggestions in this direc-  tion that may be deemed desirable.    In the decision which was reached by our General Board, it   was made the duty of these local Boards to take into consideration   the formation of Church Schools, and the best method of accom-  plishing this, and after arriving at proper conclusions, to report them  to the General Board.    Communications of this character may be addressed to Elder   George Reynolds, who is Secretary of the Board.    It was felt by the General Board that, to begin with, there should  be one Stake Academy established in each Stake as soon as practi-  cable.    The education of our children under correct influences and in   the spirit of the gospel ought to be very dear to every Latter-day 
 Saint, and we are impressed that the time has arrived for a com-  mencement to be made in this direction.    The desire is universally expressed by all thinking people in  the Church, that we should have schools wherein the Bible, the Book  of Mormon, and the book of Doctrine and Covenants can be used  as class books, and wherein the principles of our religion may form  a part of the teaching of the schools.    To effect this it will be necessary that funds be collected. The  Church will doubtless do its share; but it cannot carry the entire  burden. The Saints must be appealed to.    There are hundreds of liberal-minded people among us who  are willing to contribute to this worthy object when they find the  subject is receiving due attention, and that definite and perma-  nent arrangements are being made to establish schools of this  character.    The brethren whom you select to form this Board should be   men of character and integrity among the people, who will be able   to use an influence in the collection of funds, so that schools may  be established, good faculties be employed, and tuition be made so  cheap that an education will be within the reach of the humblest in  the land.    After you have made a suitable selection for this Board, the  names of the brethren composing it should be presented regularly at  your Stake Conferences as other authorities are, so that the people  can vote for them.    Very respectfully yours,    WILFORD WOODRUFF,  Chairman of the Church Board of Education.    GEORGE REYNOLDS, Secretary. 
 To the Presidents of Stakes, Stake and Local Boards of Education, and  Principals and Faculties of all Church Schools:    At the commencement of our labors as the General Board of  Education, the peculiar condition of the Church affairs compelled   us to be careful in holding out hopes of financial aid in the organ-  izing of new schools; we therefore confined ourselves to the an-  nouncement of some of the principles upon which it would be   desirable to have our new educational system organized and con-  ducted. But the active energy displayed by so many of the Stakes  of Zion, in response to our first circular, not only in organizing  their respective Boards, but also in proceeding at once to raise sub-  scriptions to procure furniture and apparatus, and to call for Princi-  pals and Teachers, furnishes proof that the time is ripe for the in-  troduction of this new educational system, and that the people are  ready to sustain and carry it out. Applications for assistance to  help institutions already started and to start others are numerous;  but the Board is not, at present, in a position to give all the aid  asked for, and must, of necessity, proceed carefully in its disburse-  ments.    However, we have an unfaltering faith that the Spirit which  prompted the inception of this system of education, will assist in  the progress of the work; until, by united effort, patient presever-  ance, sincere devotion, intelligent application, and firm reliance up-  on the blessings of God, all our difficulties will be gradually over-  come, and our educational affairs be placed upon a satisfactory basis  in all the Stakes of Zion.    Although the attainment of so desirable an end requires its  time of development, there are a few points within reach, to which  we desire to call your attention.    1st. It is essential that this Board receive an Annual Finan-  cial Statement from the Treasurer of each Church School, with such  other items as will more perfectly explain the financial condition of  the institution, on or before July 15th, of each year. This state- 
 ment should be endorsed by an auditing committee, and counter-  signed by the President and Secretary of the Board.    2. In connection with the above, we also desire an Annual   Statistical Report, signed by the President and Secretary of the  Board, and by the Principal and Secretary of the Faculty.    3. The General Superintendent, under instructions from the  General Board, will communicate directly with the Principals and  Teachers for the purpose of harmonizing their labors in such a  manner as will insure to the youth of Zion the greatest amount of  good, and to the Teachers a sufficient scope for their individuality.    4. It will, doubtless, be productive of better results for the  Principals of the different Stake Academies or Colleges to be  appointed by the General Board upon the recommendation of the  General Superintendent; yet this will only be done after consulta-  tion with the respective Stake Boards to the end that their wishes  may be fully satisfied. The other Teachers should be appointed by   the Stake Boards, upon the recommendation of the Principal.    5. The system of teaching inaugurated at the Brigham Young  Academy, of Provo, is that which we wish introduced in all our  Church Schools.    6. All communications between the General Board and Gen-  eral Superintendent on the one side, and the Stake Boards or  Principals and Teachers on the other, should be kept on file for  reference.    7. The General Superintendent will be instructed by this  Board to visit the schools at certain intervals, to meet with the res-  pective Boards and Faculties, to give instructions and to make such  enquiries as will enable him to render us complete reports from time  to time.    CONVENTIONS.    All Church Schools are organized into District Conventions  according to instructions published in the Juvenile Instructor. The  Chairman of each convention will be appointed by the General  Board.    An Annual Convention will be held at Salt Lake City, at which   all Church Schools should be officially represented. 
 BOARD OF EXAMINERS.    A Board of Examiners has been created by the General Board.  This Board of Examiners may call to its aid any specialists, as cir-  cumstances may require, subject, however, to the approval of the   General Board.    Course of Procedure Relative to the Examination of Church School Instruc-  tors and the Awarding of Certificates and Diplomas.    No teacher is eligible to act in any Church School who does  not hold a License or Certificate from the General Board of Educa-  tion.    Licenses and Certificates may be obtained under the following  conditions:    Annual Licenses. Teachers of at least one year's practical ex-  perience, or graduates from one of our Normal Schools, desiring to   enter the Church School service, should make written application   to the General Superintendent. They should in this application  promise to teach in accordance with the instructions given by the  General Board of Education. They should enclose their Bishops'  Certificates of Church standing, and any testimonials or certificates  of efficiency they may have. If such documents are satisfactory,  an Annual License for either the Primary or the Intermediate  Grade may be issued, pending examination before the Board of Ex-  aminers for a standing certificate in the respective grade.    Upon the recommendation of the Board of Examiners, Stand-  ing Certificates will be issued by the General Board for the Primary  Grade, for the Intermediate Grade, and to Specialists for their particu-  lar branches, and Diplomas for the Academic Grade, to all successful  candidates.    The title of Professor will be recognized as applicable in Church  Schools to those only who hold Academic diplomas as specified  above.    The Board of Examiners will give public notice of the dates   and places of annual examinations at least four weeks previous  thereto.    Candidates for a degree in any of our Academic courses must   give notice of their intention to the General Superintendent at least   two months before their examination. 
 Diplomas or certificates from any well-known University or  College may receive due consideration for the corresponding studies  in our curriculum.    Candidates for examination will be required to deposit the fol-  lowing fees in advance: Primary grade, $3.00; Intermediate grade,  $5.00; Academic degree, $10.00; Special certificate, $3.00.    No academic studies should be announced in Circulars or be  taught in any of our Church Schools, unless conducted by teachers  properly licensed or certificated in these branches.    A teacher, after having obtained a certificate for the Interme-  diate Grade, may enter at once upon a course of partial examina-  tion for the Academic Grade, under the regulations governing such  procedure. A license for the teaching of any special study in the  Academic Grade, pending the final examination, may be issued to  any one who successfully passes in such branch.    In answer to the many inquiries regarding the range of the   various examinations, the following schedule of requirements is  announced. Evidence of ability to teach these branches as well as  an acquaintance with the subject matter will be required.    Requirements for the Primary Grade.    1.

SALT LAKE CITY, Utah, Oct. 29th, 1890.    To the Presidents of Stakes, Bishops, and all whom it may concern:    DEAR BRETHREN AND SISTERS: The all-absorbing motive that   led the great majority of the Latter-day Saints to forsake their homes   in their various nations to dwell in these mountain valleys was an   ardent desire to serve the Lord more perfectly and with a better   understanding. In too many instances, in the course of the years,   this grand object has been lost sight of in the toil for daily exist-  ence, and less noble aims have largely taken the place of the en-  deavor to learn the ways of the Lord and of the effort to walk in   His paths. This benumbing influence on our spiritual life is widely   felt in our homes, and more particularly affects our children, whose   faith in the great latter-day work has not been developed and   strengthened by the experience which their elders have had in lands   beyond the borders of Zion. Nor does the training which our   youth receive in the District Schools increase their feelings of devo-  tion to God and love for His cause, for, as is well known, all teach- 
 ings of a religious character are rigorously excluded from the stud-  ies permitted in these institutions.    To lessen this great evil, and counteract the tendencies that   grow out of a Godless education, the Church schools of the Saints   have been established. But while these accomplish great good, the   sphere of their usefulness does not cover the entire field. There are   many places where Church schools cannot, at present, be estab-  lished; and also many Saints in those places where such schools ex-  ist, who, for various reasons, cannot send their children thereto.   For these causes we have deemed it prudent to suggest to the vari-  ous local authorities other measures which, while not occupying the   place of the Church Schools, will work on the same lines, and aid in   the same work in which the Church educational institutions are en-  gaged.    We suggest that in every ward where a Church school is not   established, that some brother or sister, or brethren and sisters, well   adapted for such a responsible position by their intelligence and   devotion, as well as their love for the young, be called, as on a mis-  sion, by the Bishop, after consultation with the President of the   Stake, to take charge of a school wherein the first principles of the   Gospel, Church history, and kindred subjects shall be taught. This   school to meet for a short time each afternoon after the close of the   district school, or for a longer time on the Saturday only, as may in   each ward be deemed most consistent with the situation of the peo-  ple and most likely to secure a good attendance of the children. In   some cases it will be found that the children are too wearied after   their usual daily studies to take interest in a class of this kind; in   others, Saturday may prove to be an unsuitable day.    Where arrangements can be made it will, as a general thing, be   well to secure the district school room for this purpose, so that when   they take place in the afternoon, these exercises can commence im-  mediately after the regular sessions and before the children scatter;   but where this is done care must be taken to keep the two entirely   separate, so that the law may not be infringed upon. Where the   regular school room cannot be obtained, some building conveniently   situated, and as near as possible, should be secured in its stead; the   object being to secure the attendance, as far as possible, of the chil-  dren of all the Latter-day Saints. A strenuous effort should likewise 
 be made to gain the hearty co-operation of the parents, as without   their aid the school will measurably fail in the object of its crea-  tion.    We deem it desirable that every school thus established should   be under the guidance and direction of the General Board of Edu-  cation; and those brethren and sisters who accept this call will re-  ceive a license from the Board to act in this capacity. Suggestions   with regard to the studies, etc., will also be issued by the General   Board, and other means be adopted to place these classes in harmony   with the methods of the Church School system, of which, in fact,   they will form an important part. Where it is found necessary to   pay the teacher a small stipend for his services, the General Board   of Education should be consulted through the State Board; but it   is thought that the incidental expenses for fuel, etc., may, without   inconvenience, be met by the ward, or by the people whose children   are benefited.    With a constant desire for the progress of all true education,   we remain, with much respect,    Your brethren in the Gospel,    WILFORD WOODRUFF,  GEORGE Q. CANNON,  JOS. F. SMITH,    First Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ   of Latter-day Saints.    In accordance with the foregoing circular, the General Board   of Education has selected the Juvenile Instructor as the official   organ of communication for these Religion Classes and for all   our Church Schools. The first number in each month will be used   as the medium of Church School papers.    It is essential that such copies of the Juvenile Instructor be kept   on file for reference in all Church Schools and Religion Classes.    CONDUCTING OF CHURCH SCHOOLS.    The Academic Year.    The General Board has been informed that a few of our Stake   Boards intend to continue their schools only part of the academic 
 year. As no efficient teacher can be expected to accept such a tem-  porary engagement, it is obvious that these schools would have to   depend on "makeshift" arrangements, to the detriment of their   pupils and in opposition to the high aim of our educational system.   We, therefore, desire that Stake Academies make no deviation   from the regular academic year of forty weeks without consulting   the General Superintendent.    Buildings and Furniture.    The General Board of Education has repeatedly been asked to   furnish plans for school buildings, but in consideration of the variety   of conditions, plans generally applicable can not be furnished. We   call the attention of the Boards of Education to the fact that an   elaborate architectural edifice is not essential for a successful school,   but that the consideration of the teachers' support, the health and the   comfort of students, and the condition of school furniture and uten-  sils is of far greater importance.    Circulars.    Several of the circulars heretofore published by Stake and Local   Boards have not been in conformity with the instructions of the   General Board. We urge upon you the necessity of care in this   respect, and recommend that you correspond with the General   Superintendent before introducing any essential variation.    Principals and Faculties.    Members of faculties, Principals excepted, should not hold office   in the Stake Boards. Principals are "ex-officio" members of their   respective Stake Boards.    In order to regulate the somewhat irregular mode of cor-  respondence that has been carried on between the Principals and   the General Superintendent, it is found necessary to have at least   one official communication per term from each Principal to the   General Superintendent, furnishing such information as may enable   the latter to properly represent the respective institution in his re-  ports to the President of the General Board.    The Principals will please furnish the General Superintendent 
 a complete list of their regular and special teachers, with respective   curricula, salaries, length of service in the institution, and all other   data of interest.    Should a new department be organized or an old one be dis-  continued in any Stake Academy or Seminary by the Local Board,   such action should be reported to the General Superintendent.    When Missionary Meetings and Polysophical Societies are   organized, care must be taken that the interests of Sunday Schools   and Mutual Improvement Associations be not interfered with, but   rather that the influence of our teachers be directed to in support of   those institutions.    The General Superintendent should be furnished with copies   of the Daily Programs, and Principals' Reports. Suggestions tend-  ing to bring gradually our whole educational system into an har-  monious whole will be gladly received. He should also be notified,   at a reasonably early date, of every public examination to be held.    Teachers' Salaries.    The amount of salaries for Principals and Teachers is left, at   present,  to mutual agreement between the respective Boards and   Teachers, but care must be taken that the terms to be made upon the   basis of strict business principles, and they be honorably adhered   to.    Libraries.    Each Church School should have the following books in its Libra-  ry, as they are considererd indispensable: 1. Unabridged Dictionary.    2. Encyclopedia. 3. All the standard Church works and publi-  cations. 4. Popular text books in all branches taught, beside those   adopted, for reference, by teachers and students. 5. Revised Laws   of Utah. 6. Ordinances of the city in which the institution is   located. 7. History of the World.    Current Literature.— 1. We recommend that each institution   keep the Deseret News, Juvenile Instructor, and local papers, also one   or more educational, scientific, and literary magazines.    A catalogue of all books and papers should be strictly kept and   the books classified. In connection with the Library there should be   a Reading Room. 
 Cabinets.    A cabinet of specimens, for illustration, is indispensable to the   study of the sciences.    Valuable specimens may be obtained:—by excursions to   mountains, caves, mines, factories, gardens, fields and places of   note; also by exchanges of duplicates, and by contributions   from patrons, students, and missionaries abroad. The specimens   should be correctly classified, labeled and catalogued.    Pieces of apparatus, such as cannot be made under the super-  vision of the teacher, may be obtained advantageously by consulting   with the Principals of our Colleges.    Records.    Besides the blanks for the Statistical and Financial Annual   Reports, furnished by the General Board, the following records are   deemed necessary to be kept with the greatest care, by the respec-  tive Principals and their assistants:    1. General or Annual Record with accompanying Index, con-  taining name, age, parentage, home, time of entering, depart-  ments, attendance during each term, Church standing, remarks,   etc., of each pupil.    2. Records of Plans and Programs containing the grading   and plans for all courses and classes for each term of the school   year.    3. Register of Studies, containing the reports of the class work   per week.    4. Minutes of Faculty, containing also the Principal's Reports,   Programs of Examination, and Minutes of Academic Councils.    5. Records of Standing, containing the percentage of standing   of the students in their respective departments and classes; from   which every parent or guardian should be furnished an abstract at   the end of the term.    6. Teachers' Records of Daily Attendance and Preparation.    NOTE.—The mode of keeping some of these records will have to be left optional with   each Principal, provided that the records themselves are kept, subject to the inspection of   the General Superintendent at his periodical visits.    Historical Records.    The importance of keeping historical records of our Church 
 School organization can not be over-estimated, and in order that   the Church Historian be in a position to keep an accurate record of   our educational movement, the General Superintendent is required   to furnish him annually a summary from the special reports of the   various Church Schools. The special report of each institution   should be drawn up by the Principal thereof, and, after being   endorsed by the President and Secretary of the respective Boards,   should be sent to the General Superintendent on or before July 15,   every year.    Lady Teachers.    We urgently recommend that each of our Church Schools   have the benefit of a Lady Teacher not only qualified to instruct in  the common branches, but also able to conduct ladies' work, have   special charge of the lady students, and, if possible, be acquainted   with the principles of  Physiology, Hygiene, Domestic Science,   Drawing, Music, and Kindergarten work.    General Circular No. 6 contains particulars for the guidance of   our Lady Teachers.    Music Teachers.    Great importance should be attached to the cultivation of Music   in our Church Schools. It is, therefore, recommended that the   various Boards of Education make it their special care to procure   competent Music Teachers.    Theology.    Having learned of the great success attending the use of the   Sunday School Leaflets and Picture Charts in the Primary and   Preparatory, of the "Story of the Book of Mormon" in the Interme-  diate, and of the Juvenile Instructor in all of these departments in   some of our schools, the General Board recommends the adoption   of these publications throughout our Church School organization,   in addition to the text-books already in use. It is the intention of   the Church Authorities to cause other theological works to be pre-  pared with special reference to the needs of our Church Schools.    Discipline.    A judicious teacher will rarely have occasion to supplant emu-  lative means of discipline by compulsory ones. 
 Academic Councils.—In serious cases of misdemeanor, or when   all available means of discipline have been exhausted, the Principal   may refer the case to the action of an Academic Council, accord-  ing to the following procedure: The Principal should notify in   writing the President of his Board, and request the summoning of   an Academic Council to try the case. The President should ap-  point a meeting of that Council at the earliest possible convenience,   and cause the parents or guardians of the defendant to be notified   also of the time and place of the trial. The Academic Council   should be composed of at least three members of the Board, and   the Principal and regular teachers of the school. The President, or   some other member of the Board, appointed by the former for the   occasion, presiding. Copies of the charge and the minutes of the   proceedings must be kept on record. In case of expulsion, no such   defendant can enter any other Church School until forgiveness from   the Academic Council that expelled him has been obtained.  The   General Superintendent must be notified of all such cases. The   spirit and mode of procedure in the High Councils should be taken   as a pattern on all such occasions.    No Principal or Teacher has a right to expel a student from   school without the action of the Academic Council.    GRADING OF DEPARTMENTS.    No student should be considered qualified to enter any depart-  ment unless able to pursue successfully at least two of the studies   enumerative under "GRADING," in such department.    Primary Department.    GRADING.—Chart Class to II Readers. Elementary Arithmetic,   as far as Division. Simple Lessons in Language.    CURRICULUM.—Theology, Reading, Grammar and Composi-  tion, Arithmetic, Geography, Penmanship, Orthography, Drawing,   Object Lessons, Singing, Ladies' Work, and Calisthenics.    Preparatory Department.    GRADING.—III and IV Readers. Arithmetic,—Numbers to end   of Fractions. Graded Lessons in English. 
 CURRICULUM.—Theology, Reading, Grammar and Composi-  tion, Arithmetic, Geography, Penmanship, Orthography, Drawing,   Singing, Elementary Natural History, Hygiene, Ladies' Work,   Calisthenics.    Intermediate Department.    GRADING.—V Readers and Elocution. Pract. Arith., Com-  pound Nos. to end of text-book. Higher Lessons in English.    CURRICULUM.—(Obligatory:) Theology, Grammar and Com-  position, Reading, Arithmetic, Physical or Descriptive Geography,   Orthography, Penmanship, Ladies' Work (for lady students), U.   S. History and Hygiene.    Optional: Vocal Music, Elementary Book-keeping.    Text-books and books of reference used: Bible, Book of Mor-  mon, Doctrine and Covenants, School Dictionary.    Text-books in the Primary, Preparatory and Intermediate   Departments should be wherever possible those adopted officially in   the District Schools of the respective Stake or County, in order to   avoid unnecessary expenses to the pupils.    Academic Department.    Church Schools, properly authorized to conduct academic   classes, or to organize Academic Departments, will be guided by   the instructions regarding academic courses and branches.    Suggestive Plan for the Theological Course.    Students should be graded according to age, Church standing   and previous training in Theology. Thus it may happen that   students of the Preparatory or Intermediate grades be entered in   the Academic class in Theology, and vice versa.    Primary: Simple stories from the Bible, the Book of Mormon   and Church History.    Preparatory: Life of Christ, Acts of the Apostles, and Book   of Mormon History.    Intermediate: Selections from Doctrine and Covenants, Book   of Mormon, and synopsis of the books of the Bible.    Academic: A systematic and somewhat exhaustive study of the   principles and ordinances of the Gospel as arranged in the Compen- 
 dium, alternating with Church History and Book of Mormon   Chronology. Students should be supplied with the standard works   of the Church. The Authorities have in contemplation the issu-  ance of a special work for use in Academic theological classes.    Besides daily recitations on the above subjects.    Devotional Exercises should be held morning and evening:    General Repetition Classes should be held weekly, and the stu-  dents divided into small quorums to review the past week's work in   Theology.    Priesthood Meetings should be organized to hear repetition re-  ports and to acquaint the members more fully with the duties and   organization of the Priesthood.    A General Theological Class should be held weekly, in which   all departments should participate, and interesting programs be   rendered.    In all grades, however, it should be the main object of the   teachers to cultivate in the hearts of their pupils a living testimony   of the truth of the latter-day work.    THE DOMESTIC FEATURE OF OUR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM.    In regard to our Domestic Regulations, of such potent influence   in forming the character of the students, the Boards and Faculties   will consider the circumstances of their localities, and advance step   by step in the introduction of rules, which will assist them in the   accomplishment of the object of the glorious mission given to us   for the elevation of the youth of Zion. Such regulations should   not be fetters to obstruct the exercise of free agency, but stakes   to indicate the road to the attainment of the virtues of self-control   and sense of duty.    A leading feature of the Church School system is the cultiva-  tion of the character and the control of the deportment of the stu-  dent in and out of school. All students, on entering any of our   schools, should be placed upon their word of honor to observe con-  scientiously the rules and regulations of the school. A bi-weekly   meeting should be held, in which the reports of visitors appointed   by the Principal should be received, and general instructions be given   pertaining to the behavior and well-being of the students. 
 These regulations are suggested, in the spirit of deepest kind-  ness toward the students, and are the outgrowth of experience, and   a redemption of the pledge given to the people, that students from   abroad shall be as carefully cared for while attending our schools as   they have been at home.    Regulations.    All students should be made subject to the Domestic Regula-  tions in and out of school.    Profanity and obscenity in any form should be strictly forbid-  den.    The use of tobacco or of strong drink should not be allowed.    Students should not attend public or private parties without per-  mission from the Principal.    No student should choose a boarding or lodging place against   the approval of the Principal.    Students should be visited occasionally by representatives of   the Principal.    No student should discontinue attendance without obtaining   from the Principal specifications of standing.    Students irregular in their habits, keeping late hours, having   improper associates, or visiting any places of questionable repute,   should be placed under special restrictions.    STUDENTS' OR POLYSOPHICAL SOCIETIES.    These societies should be in special charge of one of the reg-  ular teachers. Their object is to afford recreation and opportuni-  ties for acquiring general information, practice in public speaking   and acquaintance with parliamentary usage. Evening meetings   may be held once per week, at which lectures, readings, recitations,   musical exercises and like may be rendered; the public to be   cordially invited.    This being an educational movement, it behooves us, as officers   of this organization, to keep in mind the golden rule of all educa-  tion, viz.: "That no one can give what he does not possess him-  self." Let us all, therefore, be prompt, punctual, and reliable in 
 our various places and duties, and rather resign than retard the  progress of the work by any neglect of ours.    W. WOODRUFF, Prest.

 May 19th, [189]1.    President Wilford Woodruff,    President of the General Board of Education  Of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints;    Dear Brother:    As you will see from the enclosed program, the Commencement Exercises  of the Latter-day Saints' College for the Fifth Academic Year, will be held in the  Social Hall on Thursday, May 21st, 1891, beginning at 11 A.M. It would affiord us the  most sincere pleasure to be favored with your presence on that occasion, and we also  extend through you an earnest invitation to any of the members of the General Board  who can make it convenient to meet with us.    Very sincerely your brother,  J E Talmage 
 May 23rd, 1891.    Presidents Woodruff and Cannon,  Gardo House, City;    Dear Brethren: In accordance with your request, I have con-  sulted with Brother Trejo regarding his position as teacher of Spanish, and the remuner-  ation he would desire during the summer months. Not finding you at your office today,  and expecting to leave for Europe to-morrow, I take this manner of reporting to you the  results. My opinion of Brother Trejo's efficiency as a teacher, as also upon the success  which has attended his labors with our students in Spanish, I have already expressed to  you. He seems well satisfied with the arrangements of the past, in matters of salary.  He dislikes the thought of having to abandon the work altogether, and return to unsuit-  able labor for a livelihood, during the summer vacation, and says he would be well satis-  fied with half pay until the next school year opens. This, I believe, covers the extent  of the enquiries you directed me to make. I trust the answers will be satisfactory.    Thanking you for many kind assistances to me personally, and wishing you all pros-  perity and peace in your great labors for and among the people of God,    I am,  Very truly your brother,  J. E. Talmage,  per W. D. 
 Sept. 23rd, 1891.    President Wifordlford Woodruff  and Counselors;    Dear Brethren: For two years the Theological class of our  higher department has been favored with the services of Elder George Reynolds as  instructor in Book of Mormon subjects. The interest displayed by the students in  Elder Reynolds' teachings, and the good results of his efforts, have been strongly  manifest. During the few weeks of the present academic year already elapsed, enquiries  have been numerous as to the possibility of his resuming his valuable instructions.  In a conversation between myself and Brother Reynolds, he stated his willingness to   continue his assistance to our Theological work, if such met the approval of the   Presidency.    I therefore take the liberty to respectfully ask your consideration  of the matter, and should you deem it advisable to give to Elder Reynolds the time  necessary for conducting a class once or twice a week, one of the most important  branches of our Theological work will be greatly strengthened.    Trusting you will pardon my trespass on your time and attention by consid-  ering the object of it, I am,    Very respectfully your Brother,    J. E. Talmage. 
 Oct. 7th, 1891.

 I had an Interview ^with several Pottowatamie chiefs, who came to su [us]^ between Joseph Smith & the Potowatamie chiefs  me during my absence, and remained until the present    written by W Woodruff    Note from W Woodruffs Journal    Sevaral of the potawatamie Chiefs came to Nauvoo for the purpose of  Having an interview with the Prophet Joseph Smith, at the time of their arival He  had gone to Dixon upon a visit, was kidnaped, while there and efforts made to  run him to Missouri "The Indians Chiefs ^who^ remain at Nauvoo untill the  prophet returned & had his trial during their stay thay had a conv talk with  Hiram Smith in the basement of the Nauvoo House. W Woodruff & some others  were presant. they were not free to talk & did not wish to communicate  their feelings untill they could see the great ^Prophet^ propheit. At length on  the 2nd day of July 1843 President Joseph Smith ^& councollars & some of the 12^ met those Chiefs  in the chamber of his store ^Court room^ with about 20 of the Elders the following is a  synopsis of the conversation which took place as given by the interpeter who  accompanid them. The Indian Orator arose & asked the prophet if those ^the^ men  who ware present were all his Friends. Answer yes. He then said "we as a  people have long been distressed and oppressd we have been driven from our lands  many times we have been wasted away by wars untill there is ^are^ but few of us left the  white man has hated us & shed our blood untill it has appeared as though their would  soon be no Indian Left. we have talked with the great spirit & the great spirit has  talked with us we have asked the great Spirit to save us & Let us live and the great  spirit has told us that he had raised us up a great Prophet aChief & Friend unto us  who woudld do us great good & tell us what to do and the great spirit has told us  that you are the man (Pointing to the Prophet Joseph) we have now come a great ways to see  you & to hear your words & to have you tell us what to do, Our Horses have become poor traveling & we are  hungry, we will now wait & hear your word," the spirit of God rested upon the Lamanits esspecally  the Orator who spoke Joseph was much eaffected & shed tears. He arose & said unto them "I have heard  your words they are true, the great spirit has told you the truth, I am your friend & Brother & I  wish to do you good your Fathers was ^were^ once a great people they worshipd the great spirit the Great  spirit done ^did^ them good He was their friend but they left the great spirit & would not hear his words or 
 Keep them the great Spirit left them & they began to kill one another & thay have been poor & afflicted  untill now. The great Spirit has given me a Book told me that you will soon be blessed again  the great spirit will soon begin to talk with you & your children this is the book which your Fathers made  & wrote upon it (showing them the book of Mormon) this tells what you will have to do. I now  want you to begin to pray to the great spirit I want to have you ^to^ make peace with one another & do not  kill any more Indians it is not good, do not kill white man it is not good but ask the great spirit  for what you want. & it will not be long before the great spirit will bless you & you will cultivant  the Earth & build god Houses like white man, we will give you somthig to eat & to take home with  you."  whan the Prophets words were interpreted to the chiefs that all said it was good. The Chief  asked "how many moons it would be before the great Spirit would bless them" he told them "not a great  many." At the close of the interview Joseph had an ox killed for them & they were furnished with  some more horses & they went home satisfyed & contented.  There were many other things said by the chiefs & Prophet but the words I cannot now bring to mind to record    W. Woodruff

 616 THE DESERET NEWS Oct 12    DESERET NEWS:  WEEKLY    TRUTH AND LIBERTY    PRINTED AND PUBLISHED BY THE  DESERET NEWS COMPANY    CHARLES W. PENROSE, EDITOR.    WEDNESDAY, - Oct 12, 1887.    AN EPISTLE    To the Members of the Church of  Jesus Christ of Latter-  day Saints.    —    INTRODUCTORY.    Dear Brothers and Sisters:    It appears proper, at this Fifty-eighth  Semi-annual Conference of the Church  of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,  that an epistle should be addressed to  the members of the Church, in con-  formity with the custom which has  been observed at the past five General  Conferences.    DEATH OF PRESIDENT TAYLOR.    As some of the Apostles are pre-  vented, by circumstances well known  to the Saints, from appearing in pub-  lic, the Church will naturally look for  some expression from them concern-  ing their feelings and hopes respecting  the work of our God. Especially at the  present time is deep interest felt in the  utterances of the Apostles, because of  the loss which the Church has sus-  tained in the death of PRESIDENT JOHN  TAYLOR. Twice before has the Church  mourned the death of its President,  and each time the event has produced  a profound impression upon its mem-  bers. In this instance this sad event  is invested with more significance than  it would have been had it occurred in  the ordinary way. President Taylor  died in exile. For about two years  and a half he had been compelled to  live in seclusion, and to refrain from  all public association with the people  whom he loved more than he did life.    Through his decease the Church is  called the third time to mourn the de-  parture of the man who has stood as  its President and as the Prophet, Seer  and Revelator to this generation. The  experience which the Saints have  gained in passing through these trials  has been of exceeding value to them.  They have learned that God can take  care of his own work, and that they  need not worry nor yield to anxiety or  doubt concerning its management.    After the martyrdom of the Prophet  Joseph there were pretenders who as-  serted that they had the right to take  his place at the head of the Church.  Some were deceived by their preten-  sions, not being familiar with the or-  der of the Priesthood.    THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE  APOSTLES.    For some time before his death the  Prophet Joseph was inspired of the  Lord to anticipate his own departure  from earthly scenes. This was shown  in various ways; but especially in the  great anxiety which he displayed to  bestow upon the Twelve Apostles all  the keys and authority of the Holy  Priesthood which he had received. He  declared in private and in public that  they were equipped and fully qualified,  and that he had rolled the kingdom of  God on to the shoulders of the Twelve  Apostles.    PRESIDENT WOODRUFF'S PERSONAL  TESTIMONY.    I, Wilford Woodruff, being the last  man living in the flesh who was pres-  ent upon that occasion feel it a duty I  owe to the Church of Jesus Christ of  Latter-day Saints, to the House of  Israel, and to the whole world to bear  this is my last testimony to all nations,  that in the winter of 1843-4, Joseph  Smith, the Prophet of God, called the  Twelve Apostles together in the City  of Nauvoo, and spent many days with  us in giving us our endowments, and  teaching us those glorious principles  which God had revealed to him. And  upon one occasion he stood upon his  feet in our midst for nearly three  hours declaring unto us the great and  last dispensation which God had set  His hand to perform upon the earth in  these last days. The room was filled  as if with consuming fire; the Prophet  was clothed upon with much of the  power of God, and his face shone and  was transparently clear, and he closed  that speech, never-to-be-forgotten in  time or in eternity, with the following  language:    "Brethren, I have had great sorrow  of heart for fear that I might be taken  from the earth with the keys of the  Kingdom of God upon me, without  sealing them upon the heads of other  men. God has sealed upon my head  all the keys of the Kingdom of God  necessary for organizing and build-  ing up of the Church, Zion, and  Kingdom of God upon the earth, and  to prepare the Saints for the coming  of the Son of Man. Now, brethren, I  thank God I have lived to see the day  that I have been enabled to give you  your endowments, and I have now  sealed upon your heads all the powers    of the Aaronic and Melchesidek Priest-  hoods and Apostleship, with all the  keys and powers thereof, which God  has sealed upon me; and I know roll off  all the labor, burden and care of this  Church and Kingdom of God upon  your shoulders, and I now command  you in the name of the Lord Jesus  Christ to round up your shoulders,  and bear off this Church and Kingdom of  God before heaven and earth, and be-  fore God, angels and men; and if you  don't do it you will be damned."    And the same spirit that filled the  room at that time burns in my bosom  while I record this testimony, and the  Prophet of God appointed no one else  but the Twelve Apostles to stand at  the head of the Church and direct its  affairs.    THE PRESIDENCY IN THE APOSTLES.    When the Prophet Joseph had  passed away by foul assassination,  those who possessed the Spirit of God  and were living in close communion  with it, knew the voice of the true  shepherd and were not deceived by the  claims of men who pretended to have  authority. The body of the Church  followed the leadership of those whom  God had chosen, and whom His ser-  vant Joseph had been instructed to  prepare for this great responsibility.  The Twelve Apostles, with President  Brigham Young as their head, became  the presiding council of the Church.    The lessons which the Church then  learned in regard to the Priesthood,  and the rights of the Priesthood, have  never been forgotten. When Presi-  dent Young was taken from us, there  was no jar nor division of sentiment  among the Apostles; and among the  people there was scarcely a question as  to where the right of Presidency rest-  ed. President John Taylor took the  position which belonged to him, and  the work of God moved forward with-  out interruption, and with a union and  harmony on the part of all connected  with it, most delightful to wit-  ness. He has stood at our head  for nearly ten years, and during that  period he has possessed the gifts and  qualifications which belonged to his  high office and calling. His entire  career is one that can be contemplated  with the utmost satisfaction and pleas-  ure by all who love the truth and ad-  mire integrity in those who are called  to be servants of God. From the time  that he was baptized a member of the  Church until his spirit took its flight  from earth, he never wavered in his ad-  vocacy and defense of the principles of  righteousness. Under all the varied  circumstances through which he and  the people of God were called to pass,  in the midst of the deepest trials and  afflictions, his voice was always raised  in tones of encouragement and hope;  and when the storms were the fiercest,  he rose to the occasion and always  displayed undaunted courage and un-  flinching devotion to the Zion of God.  In the providence of God it fell to his  lot to be with the Prophet Joseph and  Patriarch Hyrum when they were  martyred for the truth, and he mingled  his own blood with theirs. Though  severely wounded on that occasion,  he miraculously escaped death. He  was a man whom the Lord loved.  The evidence of this is to be found in  the fact that He [c]hose him to preside  over His Church at the departure of  His servant Brigham. We feel thank-  ful to God our Eternal Father that we  have been permitted to live with and  enjoy the society of President John  Taylor and his fellow-laborers.  Our assocation with him and the  Presidents and Apostles who have  gone before him into the spirit world,  we esteem as a great honor. We take  delight in anticipating the rejoicing  that we shall have when we shall be  permitted to mingle in their society.    Once more, the responsibility of  presiding over the Church has fallen  upon the Council of the Twelve  Apostles. The Counselors of Presi-  dent Taylor, Brothers George Q.  Cannon and Joseph F. Smith, being  members of the Council of the Twelve  Apostles at the time they were chosen  to be members of the First Presidency,  have, since his death, taken their places  again as members of that Council.    Fifty-seven years and a half have  elapsed since the Church was organ-  ized. In looking around among those  with whom we associate to-day, how  few there are left of those who, under  the Lord, helped to lay . the  foundation of this work and were the  companions of the Prophet in the  early labors connected therewith.  To-day there is but one Apostle left  of those who belonged to the Council  of the Apostles during the lifetime of  the Prophet Joseph, or, indeed, at the  time these valleys were first settled.  The other faithful Apostles who were  ordained under the direction of the  Prophet Joseph have all passed behind  the veil. Since the death of President  Young four have joined him in the  other world, and in the same period  six have been ordained as members  of the Council of the Twelve Apostles.  This gives some idea of the changes  which are occurring, and how rapidly  a new generation is taking an active  part in the building up of Zion.    THE LABORS OF THE APOSTLES.    Those of us who have been at liberty  to travel, have devoted our time to  visiting the various Stakes, and in  meeting with them at their Quarterly  Conferences. Some of us have been  laboring in Mexico, others in Arizona,  besides visiting the Stakes in Idaho  and in Utah. These Quarterly Con-  ferences are attended with excellent  results. The people come together  and receive instructions and coun-  sel upon leading topics, and  much good is derived therefrom.    Though it involves considerable labor  for the Apostles to visit them, yet we  are encouraged in doing so by the ad-  vantages which those visits bring to  the people in keeping them informed  concerning general movements and  counsel. In these labors we have had  much joy and satisfaction, especially  in witnessing the increase of faithful-  ness on the part of the Saints.    THE PATIENCE OF THE SAINTS.    Though many of the leading men  have been compelled to be absent,  some of them having been incarcer-  ated in prison, the people have, never-  theless, been steadfast, and have  sought with increased dilligence to per-  form their duties. The persecution to  which they have been subjected has  led the people to think and act for  themselves, and not to depend so  much upon others for guidance. This  can not fail to be attended with good  results. It is necessary that all the  members of the Church should exer-  cise their powers of reason and reflec-  tion and thoroughly understand why  they take the course which God points  out. Intelligent obedience on the part  of His Saints is desired by our Father  in heaven. He has given us our agency  to think and act for ourselves,  on our own volition, to obtain a  testimony for ourselves from Him  concerning the truth of the principles  which He teaches, and then be firm  and unshaken in the performance of  all which is necessary for salvation.    We have felt great satisfaction in  witnessing the dignity and courage  which the Saints have exhibited  through the trials of the past three  years. Their conduct has been ad-  mirable. They have displayed great  qualities. The forbearance, patience  and fortitude which they have ex-  hibited are proofs that God has been  with them. Outrages which would  have goaded any other people into acts  of violence have been of frequent oc-  currence. In other communities men  and women would be desperate under  such treatment. But the Lord has  given His people power to control  themselves and peace has been main-  tained. Riots and bloodshed have  been avoided, and even under strong  provocation, when blood was shed, the  community restrained itself. Preju-  dice may prevent our nation and its  rulers from acknowledging at the  present, how noble the demeanor of  the people has been under  these trying circumstances, and  with the strong provocations  which they have had to indulge in  outbreaks; yet the time will come  when all this will receive its proper  recognition and due credit will be ac-  corded to the Latter-day Saints to their  magnanimity and self-control through-  out this entire persecution.    PRIMARY ASSOCIATIONS, ETC.    In the organizations which have  been established among our people in  all our settlements in these moun-  tains, the advancement and training  and benefit of all classes are amply  provided for. Among no people of  whom we know anything have such  provisions been made for the salvation  and care of the members of society of  all ages as among the Latter-day  Saints. If we and our children do not  progress in intelligence and in the  knowledge of all principles pertaining  to life here and life hereafter, it is be-  cause we do not avail ourselves of  those facilities which are placed within  our reach. We have the Primary As-  sociations provided for the benefit of  the young children of our Church, and  their instruction in those simple prin-  ciples which they can understand. We  also have Sunday schools for the  training and education of those of  larger growth. In them they can learn  the doctrines of salvation and the his-  tory of the work of God, and be pre-  pared for greater progress. Then we  have the Young Mens' and Young  Ladies' Mutual Improvement Asso-  ciations, which have been organized, as  their names imply, for the development  of the young people of both sexes and  their advancement in every thing that  will qualify them for lives of useful-  ness and honor. But besides these or-  ganizations we have the various coun-  cils of the Priesthood, to some office  in which every young man who is  worthy can be ordained. The young  women, as they increase in years, can  also find a sphere of usefulness in the  Relief Societies which have been or-  ganized for the purposes of assisting  the Bishops and Counselors and  Teachers of the Wards in caring for  the poor and relieving the wants of the  suffering and distressed. So that by  means of these organizations, which  are of vast interest to us as a people,  every one from early childhood to ma-  turity, can be led forward step by step,  from one degree of knowledge to an-  other until fully qualified to discharge  all the duties of perfevted and honor-  able manhood and womanhood.    So far as we know the sisters who  have charge of the Primary Associa-  tion are doing a most commendable  work in arousing interest in the lit-  tle ones and in teaching them  in simple style those lessons  which are adapted to their under-  standings. We hope that in all our  settlements these associations will re-  ceive the constant care and attention  of our wise and judicious sisters. The  seed sown in the hearts of the children  by the instructions imparted there  will produce in years to come an  abundant harvest that will gladden the  hearts of the Saints who witness it.    OUR SUNDAY SCHOOLS, ETC.    The progress of the Sunday School  cause in Zion continues satisfactory,  though undoubtedly somewhat re-    tarded by the enforced absence from  its labors and associations of so many  brethren and sisters who have in  former years taken an active interest  in its welfare. We notice, with pleas-  ure, the constantly increasing number  of schools, teachers and scholars re-  ported by the officers of the Union and  the evident care taken by the presiding  local authorities in our settlements to  have a Sunday School as one of the  first institutions established. We  are also gratified to learn that  in most of the foreign missions  of the Church Sunday Schools  and Improvement Associations  are being organized wherever  practicable. In Great Britain, in Con-  tinental Europe, in New Zealand, and  in the Sandwich Islands, as also in the  branches scattered throughout the  missions in the United States, these  institutions are found contributing  their influence in instructing and  forming the character of the children  of the Latter-day Saints.    The Mutual Improvement Societies  are also accomplishing great good  throughout our settlements. In connec-  tion with them and the Sunday Schools,  we desire to remind our brethren and  sisters who are engaged in the praise-  worthy labor of fostering these insti-  tutions, that the original design in  organizing Sunday Schools and Im-  provement Societies among us was,  that the children and youth of the  Saints should be made wise in the  principles of the Gospel and their faith  be developed in the revelations of  God. This the officers and teachers  should keep constantly in mind. The  books used should be almost without exception,  the reveleations of God as  contained in ancient and modern Scripture,  together with the other works  of the Church. The teachings,  while direct, brief and simple, should  be such as will increase the faith, de-  velop the veneration and love, and  draw out the intelligence of the youth-  ful bearers toward the divine princi-  ples of which by God's grace, we have  been made the custodians. All at-  tempts, however slight, to secularize  these institutions and to change them  so that they will not accomplish the  ends sought for in their creation,  should be discountenanced. The  spirit and teachings of the Gospel  should hold undivided control in all  our ministrations connected with this  cause. In the theological and other  classes all discussions should be  avoided as much as possible on sub-  jects which God in His wisdom has not  yet fully revealed. We know there are  many persons who appear to take more  delight in dwelling upon questions  which are mysterious and cannot very  well, in our present stae of knowl-  edge, be answered than they do upon  those subjects which are plain and  simple and essential to present pro-  gress. But the Lord has revealed  so much that we can understand  and that we ought to learn in order to  be useful in the labors devolving upon  us here, that we need not enter into  discussions on subjects which [in] no  way affect our happi[n]ess here or eter-  nal salvation hereafter. In our theo-  logical classes, quorum meetings and  othe assemblies, therefore, these de-  batable questions need not be dis-  cussed or be dwelt upon to occupy the  time of the members, to the exclusion  of more profitable topics. In the  Primary Associations, the Sunday  schools and the Mutual Improvement  Associations, singing should receive a  large share of attention. Singing ex-  ercises can be made a great attraction  and also a valuable addition to the ed-  ucation of the young. The interest  that is now taken among us in vocal  and instrumental music is a marked  feature of the times, and this taste  finds increasing opportunities for its  development in the facilities which are  now being furnished to all who desire  its cultivation. Instead of having a  select few act as choirs in these  institutions to do the singing for the  whole, the voices of all should  be united in harmonious melody  in giving utterance to the feelings of  their hearts in hymns and songs. This  will increase the pleasure of the meet-  ings, and make all feel that they have  an equal interest in worship and re-  joicing.    THE RELIEF SOCIETIES.    The mission of the Relief Societies  as organized among us, is truly grand  and beneficent. There is no limit to  their labors and usefulness while suf-  fering and want exist in our midst. To  aid the needy by feeding the hungry  and clothing the destitute is distinc-  tively and peculiarly their mission. In  the energetic performance of their  duty human sympathy and divine  mercy are beautifully harmonized. In  extending relief to the poor, the love  of God and of our fellows is clearly  manifest. It is more praiseworthy for  a relief society to be able to say  "There are none in our Ward in need  of food, raiment or shelter," than to  report thousands of dollars in hand,  while the needs of the poor are un-  supplied.    These societies have done a vast  amount of good among us, and the  members have been of greate service in  assisting the Priesthood in the wards  in caring for the destitute and in sup-  plying the wants of those who have  been in need of help. In these labors  we desire to give them every encour-  agement and to invoke the blessing of  heaven upon them, and all their exer-  tions for the benefit of suffering hu-  manity.    THE CARE OF THE POOR.    As the winter season is approaching,  it is proper that each Bishop and his  Counselors should take the necessary    steps to properly care for the poor  who live in their wards. They should  call the Relief Societies to their aid in  this labor. The reasonable wants of  the poor should be supplied and the  pangs of poverty and destitation  should be averted. God has greatly  blessed us in the fruits of our fields  and gardens, in our flocks and herds,  and in giving us comfortable habita-  tions and means to sustain ourselves,  and we should always remember the  words of the Apostle James: "Pure  religion and undefiled before God and  the Father is this, to visit the father-  less and widows in their affliction, and  to keep himself unspotted from the  world."    While it has always been the  policy of our people to encourage in-  dustry and to repress idleness to every  form, and to expect all persons to  contribute, according to their ability,  to their own support; still there are  many cases where the aged and the in-  firm, or the unfortunate, cannot, with  the utmost exertion and economy, ob-  tain through their own labors suffi-  cient to sustain themselves. It would  be a great evil among us to encourage  any class in living upon the benevo-  lence of the community. No system  of begging should be permitted.  Those able to work should be fur-  nished employment. Persons who are  properly disposed will be glad to ob-  tain it in preference to being fed with  the bread of charity; and all should  be encouraged to labor according to  their strength. This policy, if wisely  pursued will prevent pauperism, de-  velop self exertion and confidence, and  produce self-respect. It is a cause  of great pleasure to think that beg-  gary is unknown throughout our set-  tlements. There is no need for any-  one, however destitute, to publicly  solicit alms. But while this is the  case, the sensitive and those who  shrink from asking aid, who conceal  in some instances, their poverty,  should be carefully looked after by the  Relief Societies under the direction of  the Bishops of the wards, so that there  may be no individual in any of our  wards suffering for the want of food or  any other article necessary to sustain  or preserve life. The community whose  hearts are open to the cries of distress,  who are ready to administer of the  substance which the Lord gives them  to relieve their fellow creatures, may  always depend upon the favor of the  Lord, for he loves those who are kind  to their fellow-men, and who admin-  ister to their necessities, whose hearts  are tender, and who readily respond to  applications of this character which  are made upon them, or who antici-  pate them by giving freely to the desti-  tute.    FAST OFFERINGS.    In some of our wards there is not  proper care taken in the collection of  the fast offerings of the people. The  first Thursday in the month has been  set apart in the Church as a day of  fasting and prayer. That day should  be strictly observed. Fast offerings  should be brought with a liberal hand  to the Bishop of each ward, that he  may be prepared to supply those who  are dependent upon the ward for su-  stenance. Some wards require consid-  erable aid from the Church to help  sustain their poor, because their own  fast offerings do not supply them;  while sometimes in the same Stake  there are other wards where there are  few, if any, dependent poor. Presidents  of Stakes should make arrangements  with the Bishops of the last named  wards to transfer their fast offerings  to the Bishop of some contiguous  ward which has more poor within its  borders than its own fast offerings  will supply. In this way all the peo-  ple can have an equal opportunity of  doing their duty to the poor.    THE LESSONS OF LIBERALITY.    Experience has abundantly proved  that those who are attentive to those  and all other duties required by the  Lord receieve His blessing. God does  bless those who devote themselves  with singleness of purpose to His  work. If proof of this were needed,  one has only to notice the condition of  Elders in the various settlements who  have spent years of their lives upon  missions. Though their home affairs  may have been left to the care of their  wives and children, they are not dis-  tinguished by their poverty from their  fellow-servants who have remained at  home.    We have only to look around us to  satisfy ourselves also, that those who  are generous in contributing to God's  work are favored of the Lord. This  was the experience of ancient Israel,  and it is our experience. Yet in re-  gard to voluntary donations there is  too much carelessness, not withstand-  ing all the precious promises con-  nected therewith. The Saints should  be reminded of the obligation which  rests upon them. Our children, also,  should be taught this duty, that it may  become a fixed habit with them to  punctually attend to these matters.  Those who have strictly observed  these requirements can testify to the  great pleasure and many rewards they  have received from their observance.    This law of liberality appears to be  one of the safeguards which the Lord  has adopted to avert from his people  the evil consequences which follow  the possession of wealth. He has told  us that the riches of the earth are His  to give; but He has warned us to be-  ware of pride, lest we become as the  Nephites of old. We know the ruin it  wrought for them, and we should  spare no precaution to prevent wealth  having a disastrous effect upon us.  Many can endure poverty and be hum-  ble and live near the Lord who cannot  bear riches. They become lifted up to 
 Oct. 12 THE DESERT NEWS 617    pride and become covetous, and for-  get their God. Those, however, who  remember constantly the teachings of  the Lord concerning the earth and its  inhabitants, and who contribute of the  means which the Lord [ink splot] [g]ives them to  assist the poor and help carry forward  the work of God, exercise a check upon  themselves and give Satan less power  to lead them astray. Under the pres-  ent system of affairs, those who ac-  cumulate wealth and are able to sup-  ply themselves and their families with  luxuries and advantages that are de-  nied their neighbors, are in danger of  becoming separated from the bulk of  the people and forming a distinct  class. But the day will come when a  more perfect order will be introduced.  Then it will be said there are no poor  and no rich in Zion—that is, we shall  not be divided into classes, but shall  all possess everything of this charac-  ter necessary for our comfort and hap-  piness. But until then, if we wish our  families and ourselves to remain Lat-  ter-day Saints, we must be especially  careful to guard against the deceitful-  ness of riches.    THE DUTIES OF THE SAINTS.    The great labor which devolves upon  us, as members of the Church, is to  build up Zion. God has founded Zion,  and we should seek to extend its bene-  fits and blessings until all mankind. It  should be our constant care to do  nothing that will weaken its influence  or power or retard its growth in the  earth. This we should constantly im-  press also, upon our children, that  they may grow up filled with an abid-  ing love for the work of God.    There has been too much neglect  on this point. Many have pursued a  short-sighted, selfish policy; and have  worked to that which they believed  was their own individual advantage  without regard to the effect their ac-  tion would have upon the work of God.  Their eyes have not been single to His  glory. Such a disposition has proved  a snare to those who have indulged in  it; they have wrought injury to them-  selves, not to mention the effect their  conduct has had upon Zion.    THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF MARRIAGE.    The Lord has informed us that mar-  riage is ordained of God unto man.  The instutition of marriage, in some  communities of which we read, is fall-  ing almost into disrepute. It is al-  leged that there is a growing tendency  in this direction among us. The cause  is doubtless, traceable to the in-  crease of wealth and the dis-  inclination of young men to take  upon them the burdens of a wife and  family. As we depart from the sim-  plicity of early days, we may naturally  expect that this tendency will increase  as young men may be restrained from  offering marriage to young ladies un-  less they can give them something like  as comfortable a home as they enjoy  under their parents' roof. Extrava-  gant or luxuriant habits or training on  the part of the girls will also have the  effect to deter young men from marry-  ing. Care should be taken by every  person of influence to conteract this  tendency, and to set before the rising  generation the advantages which fol-  low well-arranged marriages. No  community can prosper and maintain  a high standard of morality where  there is a large percentage of unmar-  ried young men and young women.  We should deplore the increase of  such a class among us, and all honor-  able means should be used to prevent  its existence. The young of both  sexes should be taught that it is not  necessary to happiness in marriage  to be in the possession of wealth. In  this country an industrious, economi-  cal married couple can soon surround  themselves with all the conveniences  and comforts essential to life and hap-  piness. The satisfaction each will  have in after years in the enjoyment  of the fruits of their joint industry and  thrift will amply repay them for any in-  conveniences or privations they may  have been subjected to in the early  days of their married life. The com-  forts thus accumulated will be doubly  sweeted unto them by the recollec-  tion of their exertions in common to  procure them. No rightly constituted  and educated young woman will refuse  an offer of marriage from a worthy, in-  dustrious young man for no other rea-  son than that he is not able to surround  her at first with the comforts which  she may think she ought to have.  Young men who have a due share of  the qualities which women esteem in  a husband need not be afraid that girls  of that kind will refuse them, because  they may not be well endowed with  this world's goods. They will cheer-  fully bear their part of the burdens of  life without repining when confident of  the love and supporting and guiding  hand of their husbands.    AGAINST INCURRING DEBT.    We feel led to caution the Latter-  day Saints against forming the bad  habit of incurring debt and taking  upon themselves obligations which fre-  quently burden them heavier than they  can bear, and lead to the loss of their  homes and other possessions. We know  it is the fashion of the age to use credit  to the utmost limit, and it is custom-  ary for nations, states, counties and  cities to borrow money, issue bonds  and thus load themselves with taxes  to such an extent that large numbers  of the people are prevented from own-  ing land or even the houses which they  occupy. Thus the masses become ten-  tants and have to pay rent for land and  shelter. This is a great evil and one  that we, as a people and as individuals,  should carefully shun. Our business  should be done, as much as possible,  on the principle of paying for that    which we purchase, and our needs  should be brought within the limit of  our resources. The disposition to  speculate and to take chances upon  ventures of one kind and another  should be repressed. There are many  people who have been rendered home-  less in our Territory by the neglect of  this precaution. To raise funds to in-  vest in some scheme which has ap-  peared promising they have mortgaged  their homes, only too often, to be dis-  appointed and to find themselves with-  out a place of shelter for themselves  and their families. All this is wrong.  If the penalty for such unwisdom fell  upon the one who through those acts and  influence it is brought about the con-  sequences would not be so deplorable;  but very frequently families suffer  and the bad results are widely  felt. We, therefore, repeat our  counsel to the Latter-day Saints,  to shun debt. Be content with mod-  erate gains, and be not misled by illu-  sory hopes of acquiring wealth. Re-  member the saying of the wise man:  "But he that hasteth to get rich  shall not be innocent." Let our chil-  dren also be taught habits of economy,  and not to indulge in tastes which  they cannot gratify without running in  debt.    ZION SHALL NOT BE REMOVED.    We have been favored, as no other  people have, with wise counsels.  Their extent and variety are immeas-  urable. They cover every department  of human life. So far as we have ob-  served them, prosperity and happiness  have been the results. Whatever  difficulties we may have to contend  with to-day are due, if not wholly, at  least in great part, to our disregard of  them. Is not this the experience and  testimony of all the faithful Saints  who have watched the progress of  events among us? Had we observed  these counsels, how many of the evils  from which we now suffer would  never have been known among us.  Our neglect of them has brought its  punishment, and the faithful can see  it. But shall we not profit by the ex-  perience of the past and act more wise-  ly in the future? As the Lord has said  (Doctrine and Covenants, sec. 90, ver.  36[–]37).    "But verily I say unto you, that I, the  Lord, will contend with Zion, and plead  with her strong ones, and chasten her until  she overcomes and is clean before me: For  she shall not be removed out of her place,  I, the Lord, have spoken it."    We should begin to understand that  God's ways are infinitely superior to  our ways, and that His counsels,  though they may seem to call for  sacrifice, are always the best and the  safest for us to adopt and carry out.  Thousands among us can testify to the  truth of this from individual experi-  ence. These thousands should com-  bine and create a public opinion in fa-  vor of obedience to the counsel of  heaven that will have its proper effect  upon our children and the inexperi-  enced among us.    THE GLORY WILL BE THE LORD'S.    We also should learn this great  truth, that God will have all the glory  and honor for the establishment of  His Church and Kingdom on the  earth. Man cannot claim it in this or  any other age of the world. Nothing  but the power of God could have  brought forth the fullness of the Gos-  pel, organized the Church, gathered  His people to Zion in fulfillment of  revelation and performed the work  which has been accomplished. There-  fore, as Latter-day Saints, we are  obliged to acknowledge the hand of  God in all the blessings we enjoy.    THE CONDUCT OF OUR LIVES.    It should be the aim of all the mem-  bers of the Church to carry out prac-  tically in their lives the principles of  the Gospel. In no way can we better  convince the world of their truth than  in showing in our acts and dealings  with one another and with  mankind the elevating effect they  have upon us. We make high profes-  sions, and there should be such a high  standard of purity of life among us as  to correspond with these professions.  Our children should be impressed with  this, and be taught that the name of  Saint is so holy that they only who  are pure in heart can claim it.    If our religion does not lead us to  love our God and our fellow man and  to deal justly and uprightly with all  men, then our profession of it is vain.  The Apostle says:    "If a man say, I love God, and hateth his  brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not  his brother, whom he hath seen, how can he  love God whom he hath not seen?"    We can best exemplify our love for  our God by living our religion. It is  vain to profess a love for God while  speaking evil of or doing wrong to His  children. The sacred covenants we  have made with Him strictly impose  upon us the duties we owe to one  another; and the great office of religion  is to teach us how to perform those  duties so as to produce the greatest  happiness for ourselves and for our  fellow-beings. When the obligations  of our religion are observed, no words  are spoken or acts are committed that  would injure a neighbor. If the Lat-  ter-day Saints lived as they should do,  and as their religion teaches  them to do, there would be  no feeling in any breast but  that of brotherly and sisterly affection  and love. Backbiting and evil-speak-  ing would have no existence among  us; but peace and love and good will  would reign in all our hearts and hab-  itations and settlements. We would  be the happiest people on the face of  the earth, and the blessing, and peace    of Heaven would rest upon us and  upon all that belongs to us.    If there be unhappiness and heart-  burnings and quarrelings and hatreds  among us, they exist because we do  not observe the religion which we pro-  fess. They are not its fruits. Where  these evils exist there is a crying ne-  cessity for repentance. If any feel in-  jured by the words or acts of their  brethren or sisters, the Gospel points  out and furnishes the way by which  this injury may be repaired. Instead  of talking about this to others they  should go to the person or persons  who have done the wrong and make  their feelings known. If satisfaction  is then made, that ought to end the  matter; but if not, it can be reported  to the proper officers of the Church for  them to take the necessary steps to  terminate the difficulties. In this way  animosities and disunion can be pre-  vented and confidence be maintained.    PARTAKING OF THE SACRAMENT.    As Latter-day Saints, it is our gen-  eral custom to partake of the  sacrament once a week. If  the teachings of our Lord,  in remembrance of whom we observe  this sacred ordinance, be regarded, no  one who has trespassed can be per-  mitted to share in it until he has made  reconciliation. It is the express com-  mandment of the Lord Jesus that no  one shall be permitted to partake of  His flesh and blood unworthily. A  more perfect system to prevent the  existence of improper feelings and  wrongs, among brethren and sisters  can not be imagined. If the Saints do  their duty, difficulties do not remain  unsettled beyond the Lord's day when  they assemble to eat and drink in re-  membrance of Him.    TEMPLE WORK.    Notwithstanding the difficulties that  the Saints have had to contend with of  late, they have pursued their labors in  every direction with unabated zeal.  This is particularly noticable in their  attendance at the Temples. The wish  to avail themselves of the opportuni-  ties for attending to the ordinances for  themselves and their deceased friends  has, if anything, increased, and those  employed in these sacred buildings  have their time fully occupied in per-  forming their duties there. It is evi-  dent that the Latter-day Saints ap-  preciate the blessings to be obtained  through this Temple work. When we  reflect that we have two buildings of  this character already completed,  furnishing abundant facilities for  all who choose to go there to  obtain the ordinances of God's  house for themselves and for  those in whose salvation they take  so deep an interest, and that we have  another Temple at Manti nearing com-  pletion, and one in Salt Lake City,  which we hope to see finished before  long, our hearts are filled with glad-  ness and we cannot refrain from prais-  ing our God for His goodness unto His  people in permitting them, notwith-  standing the oppositions and many dif-  ficulties they have had to contend  with, to erect such structures and to  dedicate them, according to the pat-  tern He has given for these sacred  uses.    No right feeling Latter-day Saint  can think upon this subject without  being thrilled with heavenly joy for  what God has done for us in our gener-  ation, furnishing us, as He has done,  with every facility to prepare us, our  posterity and our ancestors for that  eternal world which lies beyond the  present life. The Latter-day Saints  are, in truth, a highly favored people,  and praise to God should ascend from  every heart and habitation in our land  for the great mercy and goodness  which He has shown unto us. He has  made us promises of the most precious  character, and he has fulfilled them up  to the present time. We would be the  most ungrateful and unworthy people  that ever lived if, after receiving such  wonderful manifestations of His good-  ness, we slackened in our diligence or  nailed in our obedience and devotion  to Him and His great cause.    FOREIGN MISSIONS.    The treatment which the Elders have  received in preaching the Gospel  throughout the Southern States, as  we are informed by President John  Morgan, has been much better of late  than it has been at some other periods.  The Elders are listened to with more  patience and do not meet with so much  of the spirit of mobocracy and un-  reasoning hate. Additions are being  made to the Church, and those who  emigrate from that region have gener-  ally settled in San Luis Valley, Colo-  rado.    The Elders in the North Western  States under the direction of President  W. M. Palmer, pursue their labors  with undiminished zeal and with mod-  erate success in bringing people into  the Church. These fields of labor  have furnished opportunities for num-  bers of our young men to gain experi-  ence in missionary efforts, and those  who have this privilege return home,  in the most of instances, better quali-  fied to assist the local authorities  where they reside in the labors of the  ministry.    In Great Britain the Elders meet  with considerable opposition in places,  principally, however, from apostates.  They find that field a much more dif-  ficult one than it was in former years.  The hearts of the people seem to have  become hardened, and great indiffer-  ence prevails in regard to religion.  Still we learn from President George  Teasdale, who presides at the present  time over the European Mission, that  the Elders who zealously enter into    the labors of the ministry and abund-  ant cause for rejoicing in the success  which attends their exertions.  Throughout the Swiss and German  Mission presided over by Elder Fred-  erick Schoenfeld, and the Scandina-  vian Mission presided over by Elder N.  C. Flygare, the Elders are laboring  also with commendable zeal and with  gratifying results. An effort is being  made at the present time to preach the  Gospel in Turkey, where Elders Jacob  Spori, J. M. Tanner and F. F. Hintze  have been, and are laboring, and even  the land of Palestine has been visited,  and in the late company of emigrants  which reached this City from Europe,  nine persons were gathered who had  received the Gospel in that  land, a land hallowed to  us as the earthly home of  our Redeemer, and the soil of which  his sacred feet trod.    On the Sandwich Islands the Elders  are laboring faithfully under the direc-  tion of President William King, and  everything is being done to improve  the condition of that people and to  save them from the destruction which  threatens the extinction of the race.  The plantation at Lale is still main-  tained, and the Elders who have la-  bored and who are still laboring there  enter with spirit into the management  of that property in a way to benefit as  much as possible the native Saints.  The attention of the Elders there is di-  rected at present to the Navigator  Islands, where some few years ago  two native Elders from the Sandwich  Islands were successful in baptizing a  large number of natives and organizing  them into branches. These Islands  have not been visited by any of the  white Elders, but it is probably that  some of our Elders on the Sandwich  Islands may in the near future make a  visit there.    The letters which we receive  from New Zealand where Presi-  dent William Paxman presides,  continue to bring us gratifying intelli-  gence concerning the condition and  progress of the work there. The  Elders are very successful among the  Maories. Many of the white brethren  have succeeded in acquiring the lan-  guage of that race, which is cognate to  that of the Sandwich Islands, and two of  them, Elders Ezra T. Richards and  Sondra Sanders, Jr. are now en-  gaged, we are informed, in translating  the Book of Mormon into the Maori  language. In Australia the Elders are  also laboring, but it is a much harder  field than among the natives of New  Zealand.    HOME MANUFACTURES.    Frequent reference has been made in  past teachings and in former Epistles  to the subject of home manufactures.  It has been, and we feel it still ought  to be, a theme of inexhaustible inter-  est to Zion; yet there remains an im-  mense amount to be done in develop-  ing our resources and furnishing facil-  ities for the employment of the people.  It is pleasing to note the progress  which is being made in some direc-  tions. Our woolen manufactures are  gaining credit for their excellence in  other communities as well as our own.  But we export considerable wool even  after all our factories are well sup-  plied. If this could be manufactured  at home, it would add greatly to the  wealth of our community, not only in  the profits which would accrue from the  use of machinery, but in the employ-  ment which it would furnish to many  of our citizens. Besides the manufac-  ture of woolen clothes, there is con-  siderable home-made hosiery of excel-  lent quality which is placed on the  market.    The range of articles which are  manufactured in this Territory is  gradually increasing; and from the  feeling which now prevails we judge  that many more branches will soon be  added to those already in operation.  The manufacture of soaps of various  grades has now become a settled and  paying business. A fine quality of hats  is also made. Boots and shoes and  clothing, glass, white lead, lead  pipe, native paints, brushes,  paper, printing type, starch,  pearl barley and oatmeal are all manu-  factured in the Territory, and many o[f]  these articles in sufficient quantities  to supply the local demand and to ex-  port to some extent. It is an encour-  aging feature in the most of these en-  terprises that those engaged in them  are seeking to enlarge their facilities  with the view to increase their produc-  tion. We have a large number of  children growing up among us who  should be furnished with opportuni-  ties to acquire skill to mechanism,  manufactures, and other pursuits  which are necessary for the comfort  of man. It is not only incumbent upon  parents to seek for avenues of prof-  itable employment for their children,  but it should be kept in view by the  leading men of the Church in all our  settlements. An idle man's brain, it  is said, is the devil's workshop, and  no community can propser and main-  tain a high standard of morality that  does not furnish employment for its  members. Far better to work for low  wages than not to work at all. But  with proper care, and by putting in  use the experience that many individ-  uals in every settlement possess, there  need be no want of remunerative em-  ployment for the rising generation,  and for others who may come in from  abroad. It may not always be kept  in mind, yet it is a fact, that any per-  centage of idle persons in a commu-  nity is a direct loss to the whole.  It is unfortunate, also, for a  community, when the young  and enterprising are compelled  to leave it and go elsewhere to find  employment or room for the exercise    of the talent of which they feel them-  selves possessed. Settlements that  are in this situation will languish and  go to decay, while others that furnish  facilities for employment will become  thrifty and prosperous. The combi-  nation of capital by means of co-op-  eration would, in many instances, en-  able settlements to start branches of  manufacture and conduct them suc-  cessfully. Chimerical schemes, how-  ever, should not be encouraged, as  their failure destroys confidence and  makes it more difficult to obtain aid  for worthy enterprises which might be  made successful. Where co-opera-  tion has failed among us, it has not  been because the principle is defect-  ive, but because of mismanagement,  sometimes from ignorance and care-  lessness, and sometimes, perhaps, from  selfishness.    Our country abounds in useful ele-  ments. We have a fertile soil, when  properly cultivated, and an admirable  climate. Grains, fruits, and vegeta-  bles, as well as all kinds of stock, can  be raised here, and as superior in  quality as can be found anywhere on  the earth. Care should be taken to  raise the very best varieties. Our  horses, cattle, sheep, and poultry, as  well as our grains, and fruits, and  vegetables, should be of the very  best kinds, and no pains should be  spared to keep them pure. Our sys-  tem of irrigation does not admit  of the cultivation of large areas of  land. Our farms are moderate in ex-  tent. This being the case, they should  be cultivated in the most approved  style, and the whole business con-  nected in a manner to bring the best  results. As facilities for education  increase, there undoubtedly will be a  marked improvement in the manage-  ment of all these branches of busi-  ness.    PRACTICAL EDUCATION.    It is gratifying to notice the interest  that is being taken among us in educa-  tion; yet there is great room for im-  provement. As the taste for what may  be called book-learning increases,  manual labor should not be neglected.  The education of the mind and the  education of the body should go hand  in hand. A skillful brain should be  joined with a skillful hand. Manual  labor should be dignified among us  and always be made honorable. The  tendency, which is too common in  these days, for young men to get a  smattering of education and then  think themselves unsuited for  mechanical or other laborious pur-  suits is one that should not be allowed  to grow among us. Of course it is  necessary as society is now organized,  that the professions, as they are  termed, should receive attention. But  every one should make it a matter of  pride to be a producer, and not a  consumer alone. Our children should  be taught to sustain themselves by  their own industry and skill, and not  only to do this, but to help sustain  others, and that to do this by honest  toil is one of the most honorable  means which God has furnished to his  children here on the earth. The sub-  ject of the proper education of the  youth of Zion is one of the greatest  importance.    President Brigham Young during his  lifetime established schools in Provo  and Logan, where the principles of the  Gospel have been taught in connection  with the other branches of education, and  more recently similar schools have  been commenced, and conducted with  marked success; in Salt Lake, Beaver  and Fillmore Cities.    The good results arising from teach-  ings received in the Provo and Logan  Academies are very apparent and  pleasing to all who have the interests  of the young at heart, and we regret  that such institutions are so limited in  number.    Through the indefatigable labors of  Professors Karl G. Maeser, J. Z. Stew-  art and their associates, these schools  have done, and are now doing, a great  work in educational advancement, by  instilling a knowledge of the princi-  ples of the Gospel of life and salva-  tion into the minds of our children,  upon whose shoulders the Kingdom of  God must rest in the near future.    We trust it will not be long before  schools of this kind will be established  in every city and village where the  Latter-day Saints reside. In the  meantime, however, the Saints should  not fail to avail themselves of the  privileges that are now offered them in  the Provo, Logan, Beaver, Fillmore,  and Salt Lake Academies.    THE "CHURCH SUITS."    Congress at its last session as you  are aware, passed a law entitled "An  Act to amend an Act entitled an Act to  amend Section 5352 of the Revised  Statues of the United States, in refer-  ence to bigamy, and for other pur-  poses," etc.    Under the 15th and 17th sections of  this law the Perpetual Emigrating  Fund Company and the Church of  Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are  respectively declared dissolved, and  in this Act it is made the duty of the  Attorney General of the United States  to cause proceedings to be taken in the  Supreme Court of the Territory of  Utah to wind up the affairs of said as-  sociations.    Pursuant to the duty thus imposed  upon the Attorney General, on the 30th  day of July, 1887, proceedings were be-  gun in said court by the United States  against the Perpetual Emigrating Fund  Company and its trustees, and the  Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day  Saints and its alleged trustees for the    (Continued on Page 624.) 
 624 THE    (Continued from page 617.)    purpose of disposing of the property of  the one and winding up the affairs of the  other: asking in these suits to escheat  to the United States large amounts  of property alleged to be held by these  two defendants. At the time of this  writing nothing has been done in these  cases further than to appear and an-  swer these complaints. What the result  of these cases will be, we, of course  cannot now say. It is proper, how-  ever, that we should speak upon this  important proceeding and let the  Saints know how the cases stand.    The Perpetual Emigrating Fund  Company, as all of you well know,  was conceived and organized for but  one purpose, namely, to aid the poor of  our people in their humble efforts to  gather with their brethren. It has  been for this charitable purpose, the  object of the generous bounty of the  Latter-day Saints, but at no time in  its history has it owned any real es-  tate, or any personal property, save  sufficient for its absolute needs each  succeeding year. The Church on the  other hand has been the owner of  property, the gifts and bequests of an  earnest, sincere people, made for the  purpose of aiding in the propacation  of the Gospel of our Savior  Jesus Christ. The effort now being  made by our government to dissolve  or wind up these associations and  escheat their property, is the first of  the kind in that history of our people,  and is believed to be without histori-  cal precedent in this country. When  we say we shall watch these cases with  deep interest, the Saints will readily  believe that it is not alone for the  property involved in these suits, but  also for the principles and rights that  are at stake.    OUR SETTLEMENTS IN ARIZONA.    The intelligence which reaches us  from our settlements in Arizona is en-  couraging; and we note with pleasure  that the people of the settlements at  St. Johns and Woodruff have conquered  some of the difficulties with which  they had to content, and which made  their position very trying. Indeed,  the news from all the Stakes there is  gratifying.    IN IDAHO.    In Idaho, though our people pay  taxes and support the schools, every-  one of our faith is denied the privilege  of acting in the capacity of a school  trustee or teacher, and no one with  our belief can take the test oath that  has been prescribed by the Legislature.  The situation of the people there is  one that excites great sympathy. They  are practically denied the rights of  American citizens through the infa-  mous test oath law which was enacted  by the Legislature. It is very trying  to their patience and bears heavily up-  on them. But the day must come  when they will be relieved from the  operation of this infamous law.    IN COLORADO.    In San Luis Valley, Colorado, the  efforts of our people to open and cul-  tivate farms, and to surround them-  selves with the necessaries and com-  forts of life, are meeting with gratify-  ing success. This is the more note-  worthy because of the fact that the  great bulk of settlers there have  not had experience in battling with  the difficulties that have to be met in  the building up of new settlements in  an untried soil and climate. Like the  Saints in Wyoming, those who reside  in Colorado have always received fair  treatment and encouragement and  kind consideration from their neigh-  bors and the officials of the State.    IN MEXICO.    Our settlements in Mexico are pro-  gressing favorably and are gradually  being strengthened, both at Diaz and  Juarez. At the places named and in  the Sierra Madre Mountains near the  latter, we have nearly one hundred  and fifty thousand acres [al[l grazing, timber  and agricultural lands.    The country is well adapted to stock-  raising, as the grasses are of good  quality and great variety, while the  climate is uniform, the temperature  seldom reaching higher than 85 degrees  or lower than an approach to the  freezing point. The facilities for  making comfortable homes there are  excellent, the land, water and timber  being good. A fine steam saw, shingle  and lath mill, and a planer and  moulder, are in operation, affording  building material within easy reach of  Juarez.    The treatment of our people by the  national and state officials in Mexico  and her citizens generally, has been  cordial and hospitable. By word and  act they have encouraged colonization  in the Republic. The settlements in  Chihuahua afford abundance of room  for several hundred families and they  could live there in peace, and by ordin-  ary habits of industry would soon make  themselves prosperous and happy.    The Mexican Mission was opened in  1870, and the Church now has quite a  large following of native Saints, mainly  located in and about the national cap-  ital. The Book of Mormon, Voice of  Warning, and numerous pamphlets  have been published in the Spanish  language and are being distributed ac-  cording to ancient predictions. Thus  the truth is being spread abroad among  the seed of Israel through the means  of the record of their fathers, as well  as by the preaching of the Elders.    THE ALBERTA COLONY.    Recent letters from President Charles  O. Card, in charge of our colony in  Canada, contain information of a grati-  fying nature. The soil upon which    they are located is said to be very pro-  ductive, and the grain and vegetables  produced are of excellent quality, and  range for stock is abundant and nutri-  tious. The colony is preparing for  winter, and the families composing it  will soon have their houses completed.  They have opened a fine vein of coal  within three miles of their settlement,  which is on Lees Creek, Alberta, Canada.    The treatment accorded the Saints  there, by officials and people, has been  considerate and kind, and the pros-  pects for improvements and propserity  are good. Brother Card would be glad  to have any of the Saints, contemplat-  ing a change of location, to join him,  in that land, and we will gladly ap-  prove efforts in that direction.    CONCLUSION.    We cannot refrain from expressing  to you our own feelings of thankful-  ness that we live in such an age, and  that God has bestowed upon us His  Holy Priesthood and has permitted us  to take part in His great work. We  are thankful that we are associated  with this people called Latter-day  Saints; that we live in a day when  Prophets and Apostles have been raised  up in the Church of Christ; and that  God has stretched forth His hand to  fulfil[l] His great and marvelous pur-  poses which have been predicted by  the mouths of the holy prophets since  the world began. We testify in the  name of our Lord and Master, Jesus,  that this is the great work of which  the prophets have spoken, that God is  the founder of it, and that it will stand  forever, and accomplish all that has  been predicted concerning it. Zion is  established and will be redeemed. And  it is our continual desire unto God that  His people may be faithful in keeping  His commandments and doing His  will, so that they may be accounted  worthy to stand, and their children  after them, and inherit the great bless-  ings which He has to bestow upon  the faithful. The day is not far dis-  tant when our Lord and Savior will be  revealed from the heavens, and we  should live in a constant expectation of  this great event, and seek, with all the  energy and power that we can exercise  and obtain, to prepare ourselves, our  households, and, as far as we have in-  fluence, the inhabitants of the earth,  for His glorious appealing.

A conference visitor in from Wyom-  ing reports that it has snowed steadily  for three days at Evanston and west of  there to Weber Canon, winter having  thus unquestionably introduced itself  in that region for the season. Our  guests find it somewhat different here  and seem to enjoy the change.    [line]    Returned Missionary.    Yesterday evening we had the plea-  sure of meeting Elder F. C. Banks, of  Pleasant Grove, late missionary to the  Southern States. Elder Banks, pursu-  ant to appointment, left Salt Lake  City on the eleventh day of October,  1886. On reaching his destination he  was appointed to labor in this eastern  part of Tennessee, where he remained,  meeting with fair success and enjoying  his labors, until he was released to  return home. He arrived in this city  on the 20th of September last, in the  enjoyment of excellent health and  feeling thankful for the privilege of  again shaking hands with his relatives  and friends in Utah.    [line]    Sunday School Conference.    The Deseret Sunday School Union  held a general meeting [at t]he Taber-  nacle last evening, there being a very  large attendance. The speakers were  Assistant General Superintendent  George Goddard, Superintendent  John C. Cutler, Salt Lake Stake, John  Lewis, Maric[o]pa Stake, Arizona, J  Pogmire, Bear Lake Stake, David  John, Utah Stake, Elder Wixom, Box  Elder Stake, President John R. Mur-  dock, Beaver Stake, and Elders Karl G.  Maeser and C. F. Wilcox, who com-  mented on the flourishing condition  of the Sunday schools, and made en-  couraging remarks to those engaged  in this great cause. An excellent spirit  prevailed at the meeting.    [line]    First District Court.    The following business was trans-  acted at Provo yesterday:    The case of the People vs. A. B. Wil-  gus, burglary, was concinded, and  went to the jury in the afternoon. A  verdict of not guilty was r[e]ndered.    The case of the U.S. vs. John Harris,  for unlawful cohabitation, resulted in  a conviction.    Judge Emerson, Judge Bennett, Ar-  ther Brown, ex-Prosecuting Attorney  Dickson, J. N. Kimball, of Ogden,  Judge Hoge and Judge Powers are in  attendance at court, most of them as  witnesses in the case against Maurice  McGrath, indicted for stealing some  notes of the court reporter in the fa-  mous Bullion-Beck case.    Loren J. Neilsen, Miles McNoy,  Joseph Barton, Henry Coats and Rich-  ard Brown were admitted to citizen-  ship.    The grand jury returned two United  States and two Territorial indict-  ments.

 Prest Woodruff addressed the Conference upon  the importance of the Latter Day Dispensation the  greatest that ever has ^been^ or ever will be committed to  man on earth. 
 1 Prest Woodruff said that the Prophet Isaiah  had faithfully described the travels of this people  from Jackson County and Nauvoo across  the Plains to these valleys and our settlements.   Zion must spread abroad the Saints will  again take possession of their own and upon   every site that has been dedicated for that  purpose a temple will be built by the Latter day [Saint??] 
 Prest W Woodruff said if the Saints  paid their tithing punctually there would be no  need to call for means to build temples as there  would be an abundance for that purpose.  The word of Wisdom is not obeyed as generally as  it ought to be. Co Operation is a principle  taught the saints as it is for their blessing. These  small towns should not have more than one   Co-Op Store. Don't pull apart and put up other  stores. He alluded to the scarcity of water and  how easily difficulties would arise among   the brethren. Warned the saints against going to [law] 
 Prest Wilford Woodruff addressed the Conference  on the necesity of living near to God and enjoying the  Spirit of Revelations. Warned against taking advantage  of one another. There are several temples in course of  erection among the Latter Day Saints and he prophesied  that they should be completed. 
 Prest Wilford Woodruff said we should be  energetic in getting as many names as possible  of our progenitors. 
 Prest W Woodruff said that the saints at  Kirtland built their Temple in their poverty. Geo.  A. Smith hauled the first load of rock that has  been used in this generation for Temple f building    Related his early experience as a missionary  Said he spoke so much about temple building because   he saw the necessity of this work. He had already   had the ordinance of Baptism performed for  two thousand of his family. 
 Prest W Woodruff read the prayer of the  Prophet Joseph while in Liberty jail. Said most  of those who took part in the persecutions in  Missouri have been destroyed one way or another  Elias was promised to come before the great day of  the Lord this refers more to the priesthood he held  than to himself. This priesthood is now restored.  Spoke upon the principle of baptism. 
 Prest. W. Woodruff spoke on the raising  of our children said a great responsibility rested  upon the mothers, as the children were always with  them and would generally follow the mother's  example, if the mother's were praying women  the children would be praying children. 
 Prest. W. Woodruff spoke upon  the blessings which could be obtained in Temples  both for the living and the dead. He also spoke  about the misery which follows those who swerve  from the path of duty and degrade themselves with sin.
