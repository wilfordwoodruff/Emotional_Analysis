The Lord has gathered us from the Nations through ^the gospel of^ of Christ He requires us to do all we can to gather the poor Saints from the Nations of the Earth it is our duty to impart of our substance for that purpose   ENDENTRY Oct 7th 1867   2nd The Education of our children. This is of vast importance to our children the duty resting upon mothers is vary  great, when does the Education of children begin. I will  not tell you what ^you^ Believe about it or any one Els But I will tell you what I Believe about it and that is I Believe  that the Education of the child Begins the day that the  Spirit of Life from God Enters into the Tabernacle and as the Mother is so will be the Child if the Mother is full of faith, prayer, and the spirit of God quiet and contented so  will be her child if she is cross Fretful and discontented it will Effect her child and after its Birth the Example  set Before the child will Effect it through life, and the  Education of the child or man will Never End untill the spirit leaves the Body and it will then continue to learn Forever and Forever. Mothers should teach there children to obey  their Father and to obey carry out his orders in all things concerning their Every day duties. If the Mother tells her  child as soon as the Fathers Back is turned Now your Father is gone you may go and pick those Apples and grapes or do any thing Els the Father has told them not to do the Mother in such a course will make thieves of their children and ruin them The Mother should sustain the Father in the government of the children, then they will all be Blessed together They should be taught to read the Bible Book of Mormon and doctrins and Covenats all good Books and let Novels alone 3rd Ladies taught Business, This is right and proper and Ladies should be taught telegraphing and storekeeping and all  such light work and let men do the Heavy work 4th 500 teams wanted to dray rock. if the people value the Blessings of the Holy Priesthood as they should they will never withhold the building of that temple 5 The Missionaries called to go South our Brethren may as well be in England as long as they are doing the will of God   6.

Lay up your wheat I do not feel that a great deal is necessary to be said upon this subject.

This is an important  subjet I think we shall have to change our maner of life in many things. But I feel that President Young is better qualified to teach this principle than I am 9. and Last Elders teach what you know and not tell what  would would have been if Christ had not died, and Adam feel, and if the world had not been made andc. I have always had more of the spirit of God in preaching the first princi- ples of the Gospel and testifying that Joseph was a prophet of God and the Book of Mormon true than in preaching many  Misteries when a Man goes into misteries he is in the swamp and does not know what he is doing   G A Smith spoke 7 Minutes and dismissed    ENDENTRY October 8, 1867 ~ Tuesday   Oct 8.
