FIGURE said when I Entered this Tabernacle yesterday morning &amp; gazed upon the vast sea of Fases for a few moments  I could hardly tell whether I was in a vision or whether it was a reality what I saw but I was soon conv inced that I stood in the Great Tabernacle of our God in which was Assembled some 6 or 8000 of the Latter day  Saints. we have had given us a certain Number  of text to preach from I consider it the duty of  the Elders to pay attention to these subjects when given to them 1 us from the Nations through ^the gospel of^ of Christ He requires us to do all we can to gather the poor Saints from the Nations of the Earth it is our duty to impart of our substance for that purpose   ENDENTRY     to our children the duty resting upon mothers is vary  great, when does the Education of children begin. I will  not tell you what ^you^ Believe about it or any one Els But I will tell you what I Believe about it &amp; that is I Believe  that the Education of the child Begins the day that the  Spirit of Life from God Enters into the Tabernacle &amp; as the Mother is so will be the Child if the Mother is full of faith, prayer, &amp; the spirit of God quiet &amp; contented so  will be her child if she is cross Fretful &amp; discontented it will Effect her child &amp; after its Birth the Example  set Before the child will Effect it through life, &amp; the  Education of the child or man will Never End untill the spirit leaves the Body &amp; it will then continue to learn Forever &amp; Forever. Mothers should teach there children to obey  their Father &amp; to  concerning their Every day duties. If the Mother tells her  child as soon as the Fathers Back is turned Now your Father is gone you may go &amp; pick those Apples &amp; grapes or do any thing Els the Father has told them not to do the Mother in such a course will make thieves of their children &amp; ruin them The Mother should sustain the Father in the government of the children, then they will all be Blessed together They should be taught to read the Bible Book of Mormon &amp; doctrins &amp; Covenats all good Books &amp; let Novels alone 3rd Ladies taught Business, This is right &amp; proper &amp; Ladies should be taught telegraphing &amp; storekeeping &amp; all  such light work &amp; let men do the Heavy work 4 the Blessings of the Holy Priesthood as they should they will never withhold the building of that temple 5 The Missionaries called to go South our Brethren may as well be in England as long as they are doing the will of God    and replenish the Earth.

Lay up your wheat I do not feel that a great deal is necessary to be said upon this subject.

This is an important  subjet I think we shall have to change our maner of life in many things. But I feel that President Young is better qualified to teach this principle than I am 9. &amp; Last Elders teach what you know &amp; not tell what  would would have been if Christ had not died, &amp; Adam feel, &amp; if the world had not been made &amp;c. I have always had more of the spirit of God in preaching the first princi- ples of the Gospel &amp; testifying that Joseph was a prophet of God &amp; the Book of Mormon true than in preaching many  Misteries when a Man goes into misteries he is in the swamp &amp; does not know what he is doing       ENDENTRY October 8, 1867    Young 15 on the  word of wisdom Commanded all to keep the word of  wisdom &amp; if the Saints trifled with this they would be sorry And I say unto you in the Name of the Lord  God of Israel keep the word of wisdom.
